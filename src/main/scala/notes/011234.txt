Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
afib with RVR, hypernatremia, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Aterial line placement
Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 yo M with history of lung cancer s/p wedge
resection, prostate ca s/p radiation and chemotherapy, new
pancreatic mass likely IPMN, and recent admission for ruptured
appendix treated medically who is admitted with hypernatremia,
afib with RVR and respiratory distress.
.
The patient was admitted from [**3-29**] to [**4-13**] for RLQ pain found to
be a ruptured appendicitis.  He was treated with medical
management and has been on Cipro/Flagyl for antibiotic therapy
since then. Of note, CT showed possible early abscess which was
unchanged to slightly improved on repeat CT.  He was also found
to have a R subclavian vein thrombosis at the site of a prior
PICC line.  He has been on anticoagulation since that time.  He
additionally had a tachycardia thought to most likely be
MAT/sinus tach wtih APBs which was treated with IV and PO
lopressor.
.
He had been doing well at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, receiving IV
Cipro/flagyl and was afebrile until [**4-19**].  At that time, he
began to develop hypernatremia and hyperkalemia with worsening
renal dysfunction.  He was then given decreased Na in his TPN
and decreased his daily K supplement from 40 to 20 mEq daily.
He was given Lovenox for his RUE DVT and coumadin was initiated
on [**4-19**].  Per report, as his Na was increasing and his HR had
increased with rates in the 140s with SBPs in the 80s, he was
transferred to the ED for further management.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.8 140/102 114 92% on 4L NC.  BP
decreased to 90s/40s up to 119/36 with IVF. He was given Vanc
1gm IV x1, Zosyn 4.5 mg IV x1, Dilt 10 mg IVx1 with minimal rate
improvement, heparin gtt started without bolus as well as dilt
gtt.  He rec'd a total of 3L of IVF.  He was intubated due to
increased work of breathing and started on fentanyl and versed
boluses for sedation.  He was transferred to the floor for
further management.
.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
IMPRESSION: No evidence of consolidation. Decreased left pleural
effusion
compared to prior. Stable right sided pleural effusion.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of fluid collection adjacent to the pancreas or
appendix.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
.
RENAL U.S. PORT
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or obstruction.
The right
kidney measures 11 cm in length. The left kidney measures 10.7
cm in length. There is a small anechoic cyst in the left kidney,
measuring 1.3 x 0.7 x 1.6 cm. The bladder is only minimally
distended and cannot be assessed.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for hydronephrosis.
.
EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and one
premature
ventricular beat. Low limb lead voltage. Possible prior inferior
wall
myocardial infarction, age indeterminate. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2107-4-4**] the ventricular response is faster.
The findings are otherwise
similar.
.
2D Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with a basal inferior aneurysm. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-4-12**],
mitral regurgitation is now less prominent. The basal inferior
aneurysm appears similar. Moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation is now detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7509**] is an 81 year old male with history of lung cancer
s/p resection, prostate ca s/p hormonal therapy and XRT as well
as COPD, SVT, CHF and ruptured appendix on medical therapy who
was admitted with respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation
with RVR.
.
# Respiratory failure: Patient required intubation in the ED on
[**4-21**] for hypoxia and respiratory distress.  Etiology felt likely
combination of IVF resuscitation in the setting of CHF, afib
with RVR, likely PE and profound metabolic acidosis that the
patient was attempting to compensate for (initial pH on arrival
to the ICU 7.16).   The patient was gradually weaned to pressure
support and successfully extubated on [**4-30**].  On the floor the
patient was weaned to room air on [**5-4**].  His 02 sat was 92-94% on
2L.
.
#Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis and A-fib with RVR.
The patient mounted an appropriate response to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test
(14.6->28.5). TSH and FT4 were within normal limits. Patient
required levophed for seve
