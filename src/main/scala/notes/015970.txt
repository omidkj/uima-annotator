Carotid u/s:
There is 40-59% stenosis within bilateral internal carotid
arteries.

Echo [**1-20**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal mid to distal inferior and
inferoseptal
hypokinesis. The remaining walls contract normally. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral
regurgitation without mitral valve prolapse. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional
left
ventricular dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.



Brief Hospital Course:
She was transferred from the OSH on [**1-20**]. She underwent
preoperative work up including carotid u/s and echo.
She was taken to the operating room on [**1-21**] where she underwent
an AVR with a 21mm [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve. She was
transferred to the SICU in critical but stable condition on
neosynephrine. She awoke and was extubated later that same day.
ON POD #2 she developed atrial fibrillation for which she was
put on amiodarone gtt and remained on neo. SHe converted to
sinus rhythm and was trasnferred to the floor on POD #3. She
continued to have episodes of atrial fibrillation and was
therefore started on heparin and coumadin. She had some
difficulty urinating after her foley was removed, her foley was
reinserted and a urinalysis was positive. She was started on
macrodantin. She was seen by physical therapy and was ready for
discharge to rehab on POD # 7.
