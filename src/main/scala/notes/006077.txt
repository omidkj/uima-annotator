History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. woman presenting with fever and hypotension.  She was
discharged yesterday from the neurology service where she was
admitted for focal weakness.  She had presented on [**11-29**] with
right-sided weakness.  MRI showed new lacunar infarct in left
thalamus but not thought to be related to her right-sided
weakness.  It was thought this may have been due to seizure or
TIA.  During that admission, she had some clinical evidence of
pulmonary edema which improved with lasix.  She ruled out for
MI.
.
Pt was discharged home, and now represents with fever and
confusion.  Per family, pt walked out of the hospital last
night.  This morning, she was more lethargic and not ambulating
on her own as usual.  She did not have any other specific
complaints such as dyspnea, cough, chest pain.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt initially was normotensive with mild hypoxia (mid 90s
on RA).  BP then dropped in 70s with minimal response to fluids.
 Started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and clindamycin for
possible aspiration pneumonia.  Due to persistent hypertension,
the CODE SEPSIS was called, central line was placed, and
levophed was started for BP support.  Pt received total of 5L NS
in ED.  She was then transferred to MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. woman with fever, hypotension, and hypoxia.  This
occurred 1 day after discharge from neurology service for ?
seizure vs TIA.  Pt did not have any focal complaints and CXR,
U/A, cultures did not indicate clear source of infection.
However, given hypoxia, pneumonia was the most likely
possibility.

1) Septic Shock:  Likely due to pneumonia. Treated empirically
with ceftriaxone/azithro for 3 days w/ marked improvement in
oxygenation to 94% on RA and stable BP at time of discharge.
Plan to continue w/ levofloxacin for total 10 day course of abx.
Had CVL line placed in the ER to maintain CVP around 12 (after 5
liters of fluid) and MAPs above 60 with transient use of
levophed.  [**Last Name (un) **] 7.3 but BP improved off pressors so stim not
performed in ICU.  Strict glucose control maintained.
Leukocytosis and fever quickly resolved.  Urine with GBS and
gram positive bacteria but blood cultures did not grow any
organisms.
..
2) MS change:  Pt has baseline dementia but had increased
agitation in setting of infection and sepsis.  We continued
outpatient psych meds--increased zyprexa to 2.5mg tid (from 5mg
qhs), and continued buproprion.
..
3) CHF:  Mild b/l pleural effusions s/p volume resusitation.  No
evidence of CHF at admission.  Held lasix and valsartan until BP
was stable off pressors.  Diovan and home dose lasix restarted
on [**12-5**].  ECHO planned as outpatient.
..
4) Hypothyroidism:  We continued levoxyl.
..
5) CKD/Azotemia: After hydration, creatinine is back to below
baseline of 1.0.
..
6) Metabolic acidosis:  Lactate has returned to [**Location 213**], and this
is a non-gap acidosis.  Likely caused by large amount of NS pt
has received.  Switched resuscitation fluids to LR.  This MA
resolved during her hospitalization.
.
7) Anemia:  Pt baseline Hct in 30s--now 29.  This occurred after
hydration and was accompanied by proportional drop in all cell
lines; likely hemodilutional.  Guiaic  (-) stools.  Followed
Hct, did not receive a transfusion.
.
8) F/E/N:  Fluids as above.  Speech and swallow eval recommended
thin liquids and pureed solids.  Re-consulted for video swallow
which showed that she was able to tolerate the abovementioned
foods w/o any aspiration risk.

9) Proph:  SC heparin for DVT ppx.
..
10) CODE FULL, discussed with patient and multiple family
members.
..
11) ACCESS:  left subclavian CVL [**Date range (1) 39125**].  Then had
peripheral line.
..
12) Comm:  Daughter [**Name (NI) 24606**]
..
13) Dispo:  Dischrged to rehab
