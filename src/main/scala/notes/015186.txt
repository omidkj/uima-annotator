History of Present Illness:
76 y/o female with ? underlying dementia had recent fall 2wk pta
with mild head trauma then had another fall day of presentation
to OSH ED.  CT head demonstrated acute on chronic SDH 1.3cm with
4mm right to left shift.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurg
consultation.  Repeat CT demonstrated stable SDH but pt
symptomatic for left pronator drift.  Taken to OR for craniotomy
and evacuation of SDH [**2109-1-17**].  Hospital course complicated by
CHF likely due to diastolic dysfunction and high afterload with
prerenal azotemia.  CHF resolved with mild diruesis and BP
control.  ARF also resolved (baseline creat 1.5) with free water
bolus.  Also had mild hypernatremia which resolved with free
water boluses through NGT.  She was asymptomatic for her
electrolyte disturbance before and after correction.

Presently has had difficult to manage hypertension.  Was on
single-medication, Zestril, as outpatient, though BP control is
unknown.  Post op was on nipride gtt for tight control, then
tapered off, now on betablocker, nitrate, and hydralazine.  ACEI
and HCTZ not initiated given recent ARF that has now resolved
though patient continues to have elevated BUN:Cr ratio.  BP has
improved slowly from 180??????s now to 150??????s over later course of the
day.  She is asymptomatic without headache, chest pain, or SOB.

Pertinent Results:
LABS ON DISCHARGE:

RADIOLOGY:
CT, HEAD W/O CONTRAST, [**2109-1-16**]:
There is an acute subdural hematoma along the right frontal-
temporal- parietal cerebral convexity surface, of maximum width
1.6 cm. No evidence is intra-axial hemorrhage is seen, and no
blood products are present in the ventricles.

Associated with the right subdural hematoma is a moderate mass
effect on the right lateral ventricle, as well as moderate
leftward shift of the normally midline structures. The
ventricles remain patent, and there is no hydrocephalus. The
left cerebral hemispheric sulci are prominent, likely
representing age- related involutional change. The right sided
sulci are effaced by the hemorrhage.

The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved with no
evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction. There
is, however, hypoattenuation of the periventricular white matter
of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally, especially on the left,
most likely representing chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
A small chronic lacunar infarct is likely present in the left
caudate nuclues, and a smaller one possibly on the right as
well. There is a small cortical hypodensity in the left lateral
frontal lobe, possibly representing a chronic infarct.

There is slight soft tissue swelling on the right calvarium
overlying the region of the subdural hematoma, but no evidence
of fracture. The paranasal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. Acute subdural hematoma along the right cerebral convexity
surface. 2. Moderate shift of the normally midline structures on
the left.
3. Evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
4. Prominent sulci suggesting mild age-related involutional
changes.

CT, HEAD, [**2109-1-17**]:
Comparison with the prior study of [**1-16**] shows little
alteration in the extent of the large right cerebral convexity,
acute subdural hemorrhage causing effacement of the contiguous
cerebral sulci. There are multiple chronic lacunar infarcts seen
within the caudate nuclei bilaterally. The degree of
contralateral shift of normally midline structures and
ventricular compression is unaltered in extent. The surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures display no new abnormalities.
The slight right-sided calvarial soft tissue swelling has not
changed in extent.

CT, HEAD, [**2109-1-18**]
1) Status post craniotomy, drainage catheter placement and
evacuation of subdural hemorrhage.
2) Interval development of small amounts of subarachnoid and
intraventricular blood.
3) Interval increase in size of ventricles which may be
secondary to resolution of mass effect.
Findings communicated to the ordering physician at the time this
report was issued.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2109-1-19**]:
1. Interval increase in interventricular blood, and slight
interval increase in subarachnoid blood layering adjacent to the
right temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes, and adjacent to the
left parietal and temporal lobes.
2. No interval change in mass effect.
3. Status-post right frontal craniotomy with drainage catheter
is place.

CT HEAD, [**2109-1-21**]:
Stable appearance of small extraaxial hematoma adjacent to the
right frontal craniotomy site. Stable appearance of subarachnoid
hemorrhage and decrease in intraventricular blood.

CXR, [**2109-1-21**]:
Stable mild congestive heart failure allowing for differences in
lung volumes

CT, SPINE: 1) No evidence of fracture.
2) Degenerative changes of the mid-cervical spine as described.

TRAUMA #2 (AP CXR & PELVIS PORT)  [**2109-1-16**]:
1. Limited chest x-ray due to technique. No definite acute
cardiopulmonary abnormality is visualized.
2. No fracture of the pelvis.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2109-1-24**]:
Penetration and aspiration with every consistency as above.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o woman with acute on chronic subdural bleed admitted for
neurosurgical intervention.  Hospital course outlined by
problem:

##Subdural hematoma: secondary to fall 2 weeks PTA and then new
fall without LOC.  She underwent repeat CT which demonstrated
mild interval change but confirmed right to left midline shift.
She was symptomatic on neurologic exam with left sided pronator
drift.  She underwent craniotomy for evacuation of the hematoma.
 She required nipride gtt with IV  BB and hydralazine for
optimal blood pressure control which was weaned.  Repeat CT
post-op demonstrated much increased intraventricular blood which
slowly resolved over time.  She had no evidence of any
rebleeding with mass effects.  She continued to be delerious
however this also improved over time.  This was felt to be
secondary to recent neurosurgical procedure, ICU stay in the
setting of baseline mild dementia.  Delirium work up was
negative.  In her delirious state, patient had another fall in
the hospital, but repeat head CT was stable and neuro exam was
normal.  She will need to be seen by her neurosurgeon within 2
weeks of her hospital discharge for removal of her staples.  She
will need to undergo repeat CT of her head prior to this visit.
She will need seizure prophlaxis with the Dilantin until [**2-17**]
(one month after SDH evacuation).

##Hypertension: her
