57 year old male with chief complaint of bilateral leg edema,
cellulitis, not responding to keflex. Keflex was started 2 weeks

In ED, 97.9  136  128/72  18  96 had b/l LENIs which were
negative for DVT, also received vanco, then unasyn.  Also
received morphine then dilaudid for pain, and after ten hrs in
the ED was changed from floor rec to ICU bed rec for hypotension

Pertinent Results:
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
examination of the right and left common femoral vein,
superficial femoral vein, and popliteal veins were performed and
demonstrate normal compressibility, augmentability and
respiratory variation and flow. No intraluminal thrombus was
identified.

The subcutaneous tissues are remarkably edematous in both legs.
There are no drainable fluid collections along the courses of
the veins bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: No DVT involving the right or left lower extremity.

Cardiology Report	ECG	Study Date of [**2135-10-26**]  4:52:12 PM

Supraventricular tachycardia. Consider atrial flutter with
predominant
2:1 block with some R-R variability. Since the previous tracing
of [**2135-4-4**] the
supraventricular tachycardia is new.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval r heart border for mass

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with CP p/w b/l cellulitis and tachycardia and
hypotension
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval r heart border for mass
HISTORY: Tachycardia and hypotension with suspicious poor
definition of the right heart border.

FINDINGS: Unfortunately, the lateral view is inadequate because
the patient was unable to properly move his arms off of the
region of the cardiac silhouette. There is no change in the
appearance on the frontal view. If clinically necessary to
exclude pathology, CT would be required.

Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2135-4-4**].

The heart size is unchanged but there is additional new
lobulation at the right heart border partially obscuring it. The
azygos vein is distended. The bilateral perihilar haziness has
increased in the meantime interval. The overall lung volumes are
slightly lower.

The above described findings may represent mild volume
overload/pulmonary edema. The right paracardiac new lobulation
may be related to low lung volumes _____ namely representing
atelectasis, although other differential diagnoses such as
loculated effusion or new mass should be included. Repeated PA
and lateral radiographs after improvement of patient's volume
status are highly recommended. Findings were discussed with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 9:14 a.m. or [**2135-10-27**].

Deformation of the right clavicle most likely related to old
fracture is again noted.

ECHO: Conclusions
Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. At least
moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSIOn: Pulmonary hypertension with preserved biventricular
systolic function.
