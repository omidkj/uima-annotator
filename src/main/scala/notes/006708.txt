History of Present Illness:
55 year old man with Afib, dilated cardiomyopathy, alcoholic
cirrhosis, COPD, ESRD; presenting to ED w/ anasarca not
responsive to Lasix. He has noted increased shortness of breath,
pedal edema, orthopnea, and cough x 3 days. Has gained 13 pounds
at rehab over the last week. Increased diuresis was attempted at
rehab (80 mg IV lasix TID). He was seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4883**] at his
rehab, decision to admit for initiation of HD (?CVVHD vs. daily
HD). Will need a line for HD. Other ROS at rehab notable for
several days of lower extremity redness concerning for
cellulitis (not recently on antibiotics) and dropping
hematocrits with guiaiac positive stools (in setting of
supratherapeutic on coumadin) necessitating 2 units PRBCs over
the last two days.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.9 76 115/82 20 98% on 6L. HRs
mostly in 120s. BPs in low 100s. Tried and then refused bipap
and facemask. 90% on 6L. Patient was given vanc, zosyn, 80 mg
lasix plus zaroxlyn 5 mg.
.
In the MICU, patient sleepy but arousable. Denies pain
complaints. Does endorse cough, nonproductive of sputum.
Endorses that he is DNR/DNI but does not provide further
history.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, headache, blurry vision, shortness of

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

[**12-10**] EKG
Tracing is suspicious for reversal of left arm and left leg
electrodes.
Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 120, with right
bundle-branch block (possibly rate-related) with secondary
repolarization abnormalities in most leads, but primary
repolarization abnormalities in leads II and V6. Low limb lead
voltage. Poor anterior R wave progression, question normal
variant versus prior anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2083-12-13**] atrial fibrillation
with a rapid ventricular response has replaced sinus rhythm and
right bundle-branch block is more pronounced. Low limb lead
voltage and poor R wave progression are new. Differential
includes pericardial effusion, worsened pulmonary process, and
ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested.

[**12-11**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Right
bundle-branch
block. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Low voltage in the limb
leads.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change.


[**12-11**] Echo
IMPRESSION: Marked right ventricular cavity enlargement with
free wall hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
[**12-11**] CXR

A bedside upright radiograph of the chest in the frontal
projection was
obtained with the patient slightly rotated. Note is made of
cardiomegaly. In addition, there is diffuse engorgement of the
pulmonary vasculature. Left basal atelectasis is also noted. A
right pleural effusion is small. Multiple sternotomy wires are
visualized, one of which is fractured.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular engorgement .

[**12-11**] UE u/s

No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper
extremity.

[**12-11**] BLE u/s

Limited study secondary to patient discomfort and marked lower
extremity
edema. The calf veins were not interrogated secondary to
overlying dressings. No DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
Non-compressibility of the right common femoral vein and
superficial femoral vein is attributed to marked lower extremity
edema.

[**12-13**] CXR

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is no
relevant
change. Perihilar haziness and increase in diameter of the
pulmonary
vasculature suggests mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. In
addition, a
preexisting left-sided consolidation in the basal lateral parts
of the thorax could suggest a combination of pleural effusion
and subsequent atelectasis.  The fact that this opacity is
completely unchanged since [**2100-12-11**] makes pneumonia
