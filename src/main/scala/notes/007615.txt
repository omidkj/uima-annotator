History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75853**] is a 52-year-old man with AIDS (CD4 114, VL
undetectable per pt's report), hepatitis C, multivessel CAD,
bicuspid aortic valve, [**1-25**]+ aortic insufficiency, class [**12-26**]
heart failure, who recently moved from [**State 33174**] to MA for
medical care and now presents with increasing CP. Pt reports a
history of chronic stable angina: SSCP that occurs w/ exertion,
associated w/ nausea, diaphoresis & lightheadedness. Relieved w/
rest and SL nitro. He has been under significant stress recently
w/ his move from MO to MA. His mother is also sick and currently
hospitalized. Over the last few days to week, the pt has been
having daily CP (more frequently than previously). On day of
presentation, he had his typical angina w/ exertion in the AM,
which was releived w/ SL nitro. Then, during the evening, while
visiting his mom in the hospital, he experienced his usual sx's,
but at rest. His pain, again, resolved w/ SL nitro. He went to
the [**Hospital **] Hosp ED for evaluation. EKG showed SR, Q waves in I
& aVL, TWI/biphasic Ts in I & I &aVL, & TW flattening in V6. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as he is in the process of getting
evaluated for possible CABG, MVR, & AVR--he has already seen his
new cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] and has an appointment on [**2146-1-27**] w/
CT surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **].

In ED, 98, 50, 115/71, 20, 99% on RA. EKG was unchanged from
that done at [**Hospital **] Hosp. He was CP free. He was given 325mg
ASA (he'd already taken his BBlocker & plavix). Heparin was not
started as pt was pain free & reported h/o of easy bleeding.
.
On review of systems, pt reports recent dental work w/ teeth
extraction. Had flu sx's prior to dental work. Got flu shot. He
denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism. He does occas have nose bleeds, ASA was
stopped b/c of this. No myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.

pain at present. He does have dyspnea on exertion p ~1block. No
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
