CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2133-10-2**] 10:58 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: interval chnage in PTX

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old man with s/p thorocotomy, 2 right CT's-posterior
tube clamped/ anterior tube to water seal.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval chnage in PTX
HISTORY: Chest tubes clamped and/or to water seal.
Lateral and two frontal chest radiographs. Since examination 24
hours earlier on previous day, the more posterior of the two
right chest tubes has been removed. The large right pneumothorax
is unchanged in size and appearance with no focal mass and
probably no consolidation in secondarily collapsed lung. Heart
is normal in size with tortuous aorta. Clear left lung without
vascular congestion. No effusions identified. Right subcutaneous
emphysema.
IMPRESSION: Removal right chest tube with otherwise no change.
Specifically, the large right PTX is unchanged.
cardiac echo;
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities
include inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis (the apex is not
fully visualized).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation
is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of
[**2133-4-7**], regional wall motion is probably similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**2133-9-16**] for bronch, med and right upper
obectomy via right thoracotomy.
Operative course was notable for raw parenchyma along the
sharply developed right minor fissure was oversewn with 2
layers of Prolene. 2 right chest tubes were placed and connected
to sxn with continuous air leaks d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] parenchyma.
Post operative course was complicated by persistant air leaks,
secretions requiring serial bronchs, and afib. These air leaks
were prolonged and pt was unable to tolerate water seal. Chest
tubes were doxycyclined x 3. After approx 2 weeks, pt was able
to [**Last Name (un) 1815**] clamping of one chest tube which was removed and the
remaining chest tube was placed to a hemlick valve with a
continued but slow leak upon discharge.
Pt initially required serial bronch's to clear secretions and
was started on augmentin for PNA.
AFIB: post operative afib was managed with amiodarone and
lopressor. Pt was subsequently admitted to the CCU for severe
bradycardia. Pt's amiodarone and lopressor were d/c'd. His heart
rate stabilized and his afib remained rate controlled without
beta blocker. He was started on anticoagulation -lovenox with
bridge to coumadin. His INR on d/c was 2.1. His primary care,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7790**] will follow his INR. His lisinopril was resumed as
prior to admission for BP control.
Pain: was initially controlled w/ epidural, transitioned o PCA
then to po percocet w/ good relief.
He was [**Last Name (un) 1815**] reg diet, ambulating w/ walker and remained O2
dependent.
He was d/c'd to home w/ VNA follow up.
