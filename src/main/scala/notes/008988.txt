Service:  MEDICINE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79 year-old white male
nursing home resident iwth a history of O2 dependent chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and multiple medical issues.
The patient is normally mentally intact and was in his usual
state of health until one day prior to admission when he
developed a fever up to 102 degrees and was started
empirically on Levaquin.  Chest x-ray from [**2129-11-2**] for rib
pain showed patchy right lower lobe infiltrate.  Today he had
marked deterioration in his mental status and decreased his
sats to 65% with significant respiratory distress.  His vital
signs were temperature 100.8, heart rate 108, blood pressure
104/40.  In the Emergency Department the patient's initially
arterial blood gas was 7.19/79/63 on 100% nonrebreather mask.
Chest x-ray showed right lower lobe consolidation.  BiPAP at
a setting of [**11-20**] was attempted for one hour with a repeat
arterial blood gas showing 7.20/73/66 at which time it was
elected to intubate with succinylcholine and ______________.
The patient was given Ceftriaxone and Flagyl in the Emergency
Department.  Blood pressure dropped to as low as 70/40 in the
Emergency Department after the intubation, which responded to
a 1 liter fluid bolus.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease continuous home O2, previously on steroids,
no pulmonary function tests available.  2.  Pneumonia status
post intubation in [**2129-5-14**] at the VA.  3.  Atrial
fibrillation.  4.  Hypertension, recent baseline blood
pressure 130/72, not on medications.  5.  Anemia baseline
hematocrit 32.4 from [**2129-9-13**].  6.  Prostate cancer

chloride 105, bicarb 27, BUN 26, creatinine 1.3, glucose 106,
PTT 38.3, INR 2.2.  Arterial blood gas 7.19/79/63 on 100%
nonrebreather and 7.20/73/63 on BiPAP at a setting of [**11-20**] at
60%.  Chest x-ray right lower lobe consolidation, which is
new compared with chest x-ray from two days prior.
Electrocardiogram multifocal atrial rhythm at a rate of 98
beats per minute with premature ventricular contractions, QRS
of 88 milliseconds, Q waves noted in 3 and F, no ST or T wave
changes.  No comparison electrocardiograms available at this

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, Mr. [**Known lastname 40951**] is a 79 year-old
male nursing home resident with an O2 dependent chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, history of prior intubations
for pneumonia in O6/02 who was admitted to the MICU from the
Emergency Room on [**11-4**] for fever, desaturations to 65% and
respiratory distress.  A chest x-ray revealed a right lower
lobe infiltrate.  Initial arterial blood gas was 7.19/79/63.
The patient was given antibiotics and tried on BiPAP with no
improvement.  The patient was subsequently intubated with
post intubation, hypotension and transferred to the unit.

MICU course:  The patient was treated with Ceftriaxone and
Levofloxacin and a short course of steroids and was continued
on mechanical ventilation.  He required intravenous fluids
and Dopamine for hypotension thought to be post intubation
versus sepsis.  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction and deep venous thrombosis.  The patient self
extubated himself on [**11-8**] and did well from a respiratory
standpoint.  However, he did develop agitation and required
significant sedation.  The patient was thought to be in
benzodiazepine versus narcotic withdraw and a psych consult
was started for a benzodiazepine taper.  The patient was
called out to the floor on [**2129-11-10**] on po Levofloxacin.

On [**11-11**] one day after being called out to the floor, the
patient developed progressive respiratory distress,
tachypnea, mental status changes.  His arterial blood gas was
7.29/53/74.  This represented an interval decrease in his pH
and increase in his CO2 retention.  The patient's examination
was significant for diffuse expiratory wheezing.  He was felt
to be having a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation and was transferred back to the unit.  The
patient was reintubated there for worsening CO2 retention on
serial arterial blood gas despite BiPAP.  He was also noted
at the time of MICU readmission to be in multifocal atrial
rhythm.  He was treated with steroids and nebulizers.  Due to
an increasing white count and secretions, the patient was
initially felt to have a ventilator acquired pneumonia and
was started on Zosyn on [**2129-11-14**].  However, because the
patient was very quickly extubated on [**2129-11-16**], it was felt
that the patient probably did not have a new pneumonia, and
instead had increased secretions and mucous plugging, which
led to his repeat respiratory distress and reintubation.
Also, his multifocal atrial rhythm was treated with beta
blockers initially.  This was changed over to Diltiazem.

At the time of his call out back to the floor on [**2129-11-17**] the
patient was no longer delirious or agitated.  He had no
complaints.  The patient denied any shortness of breath or
chest pain.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient is normally on O2 at his nursing
home for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The plan
is to continue an oral steroid taper, decreasing the
Prednisone dose by 10 mg every two days.  The plan is also to
continue his nebulizers and supplemental O2.

2.  Infectious disease:  It is uncertain at this point wether
or not the patient has a secondary infection given that there
are no organisms isolated on his sputum culture.  His blood
cultures were negative, the white blood cell count has come
down and the patient is afebrile.  At this time there is no
plan to send the patient out on antibiotics.

3.  Cardiovascular:  The patient's Lopresor was changed to
Diltiazem.  The patient was noted to be slightly bradycardic
at a rate of 48.  For this reason his Diltiazem was decreased
to 30 mg po t.i.d.

4.  Neuropsych:  The patient's delirium dramatically
improved.  He is noted to be slightly disoriented, but easily
reoriented.  The patient completed his benzodiazepine taper
and is no longer requiring Haldol.  The patient is to
continue his Fentanyl patch with prn Oxycodone at a dose of 5
mg.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient is to continue on a regular
insulin sliding scale while he is on the steroids.

6.  FE
