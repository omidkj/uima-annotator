Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old woman with
a history autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis and a chronic
abdominal abscess from diverticulitis who presented with some
increased abdominal pain and subjective fevers. This began
approximately 3 days prior to admission. She had noted a low-
grade fever of 100.3 degrees at home but denied any nausea,
vomiting, shortness of breath or diaphoresis. Her appetite
had been good at home.

She was originally seen at an outside hospital where her
liver function tests were significant for an ALT of 586 and
an AST of 370. Her amylase was normal. She was originally
accepted by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] who follows her as an
outpatient for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], with a presumed diagnosis
of autoimmune hepatitis exacerbation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Autoimmune hepatitis x 5 years.
2.  Cirrhosis; on the transplant list.
3.  Chronic abdominal abscess controlled with a long course
    of antibiotics which included daptomycin.
4.  Celiac sprue.
5.  Osteoporosis.
6.  COPD.
7.  Status post hysterectomy.
8.  Status post laryngeal tumor removal which was benign.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Prednisone 20 mg daily.
2.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg t.i.d.
3.  Cholecalciferol 400 mg daily.
4.  Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to AMOXICILLIN, SULFA
DRUGS, CODEINE and IODINE-CONTAINING CONTRAST.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her daughter who is
her healthcare proxy. She has a history of tobacco use but
quit 5 years ago. In addition, she also drank quite heavily
but quit 5 years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her father died of cirrhosis. Her mother
also had hepatitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs reveal temperature of
100.9, blood pressure of 95/55, heart rate of 95,
respirations of 20, SPO2 of 94% on room air. In general, she
was in no acute distress. Her neck was supple without JVD.
Her heart was regular with normal S1/S2 with no murmurs, rubs
or gallops. Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her abdominal exam showed a tense belly that was
hyperresonant to percussion and mildly distended. She was
mildly tender in the epigastrium. Her skin was not jaundiced,
although she did have a large bruise on her left shin. Her
extremities were clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Neurological
exam was grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Her complete blood count was
significant for a white blood cell count of 7; and a
hematocrit of 31.6, platelets of 116,000. Coagulation panel:
PT of 16.3, PTT of 31.4, INR of 1.8 (elevated from her most
level of 1.5 on [**8-21**]). She had a urinalysis that was
negative. Electrolytes: Sodium of 132, potassium of 4.2,
chloride of 106, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 18, creatinine of
0.8, glucose of 96. Her liver function tests were elevated at
ALT of 291, AST of 357, LDL of 254, alkaline phosphatase of
96, amylase of 101, and her total bilirubin was 1.9.

RADIOLOGICAL DATA:  On admission the patient had a chest x-
ray which was significant for small pleural effusions, but
otherwise unremarkable.

She also had a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with recons
which demonstrated a small increase in size of her
diverticular abscess and a small amount of intra-abdominal
free air. Again seen were her extensive significant
diverticula.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted at first to
the hepatology service for a presumed diagnosis of autoimmune
hepatitis exacerbation. However, upon further review of her
CT scan it was felt that she may have sustained an injury to
her bowel given that she had a small amount of free air on
her CT scan.

To investigate this she was taken to the operating room on
[**2132-9-5**] for exploratory laparotomy. During the
operation there was no frank stool and succus noted in
peritoneal cavity. However, a small 6-mm tear was found in
the duodenum. Please see the separately dictated operative
note for details. A gram patch was applied to fix this
lesion. She was stable in the post anesthesia care unit after
the procedure. Her vital signs were stable, and she was
extubated in the PACU. She was then admitted on postoperative
day zero to the ICU for close monitoring. Her vital signs
remained stable, and she did quite; requiring no pressor
support.

She was transferred to the floor on postoperative day 2 with
her vital signs remaining stable. She was restarted on her
home medications and treated with levofloxacin, Flagyl and
daptomycin for bacterial prophylaxis for her perforated
duodenal ulcer. She had an H. pylori serological study sent
which was negative. She also had a liver biopsy sent during
the operation, the final report of which came back as
consistent with autoimmune hepatitis. The patient was also
given stress-dose steroids during the perioperative period.
During her initial course in the ICU she was transfused 2
units of packed red cells for postoperative anemia and 4
units of fresh frozen plasma for postoperative coagulopathy.
She had a feeding tube placed during the operation which was
used beginning on postoperative day 2, starting at a basal
rate of tube feeds. These were advanced to her goal of 70 cc
an hour. Nutritional service was consulted, and her tube feed
regimen was optimized to include ProMod at 3/4 strength and
to be run at 75 cc an hour. This will be advanced to cycling
overnight.

On postoperative day 6, the patient had been afebrile for her
entire hospital course; and her vital signs were otherwise
stable. She was tolerating a p.o. diet with supplementation
by tube feeds. Her pain was under adequate control on p.o.
narcotics, and she was able to get out of bed on her own
strength. She was discharged home in stable condition.
