Chief Complaint:
transfer from [**Hospital 12017**] [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital for further care

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72 yo male CAD s/p CABG complicated by persistent
sternal wound infection/osteomyelitis growing pseudomonas, ARF
on dialysis, CHF, and hepatic failure who is being transferred
from OSH after a two month stay there for further care at [**Hospital1 **]
from the Liver service.
.
Pt s/p CABG on [**2125-11-29**]. His postoperative course was
complicated by congestive heart failure, acute renal failure,
atrial fibrillation, and persistent wound infection
(pseudomonas, MRSA) with osteomyelitis. On [**2126-10-13**], Mr. [**Known lastname 69992**]
was admitted to OSH with dyspnea/orthopnea and non-healing
wound. MRI of chest done then showed erosive destruction of the
sternum, consistent with osteomyelitis. He was followed by
infectious disease and cardiothoracic teams and placed on
zosyn/ceftazidime. After one week of purulent drainage from
track in mid-portion of wound, it was found to be fluctuant. On
[**2126-10-21**], pt went to the OR and underwent sternal debridement.
This was complicated by an arterial bleed. It was found to be in
the mammary artery and pt was placed on bypass temporarily in
the OR. He was maintained on pressor support and ionotropes
(unclear per d/c summary which ones) and ? seizure activity. Pt
was already intubated (unclear when this was done) and
maintained on propofol. He was taken back to the OR on [**2126-10-24**]
for further debridement of his sternal wound and excision of
infected bone. Pt was able to be extubated from the ventilator
on [**2126-10-26**]. He started to be diuresed for CHF with lasix.
.
In terms of pt's renal function, creatinine rose to 3.9 with
"good amounts of urine," ~30-50 cc/hr and normal potassium on a
lasix gtt. Renal was consulted in pt's third week of stay.
Dopamine gtt was added. Over the next few days, creatinine rose
to 6.9. Dialysis was initiated on [**2126-11-6**] and pt is still on
it. It is unclear per d/c summary what they thought that the
underlying reason for renal failure was.
.
For the sternal wound infection, antibiotics were initiated once
wound culture came back as pseudomonas as pt was started on
zosyn and ceftazadine. Pt was debrided as above. He went back to
the OR on [**2126-11-12**] for further debridement and teams tried to
improve alimentation and started TPN. Wet--> dry dressing were
continued and VAC was placed on [**2126-11-27**].
.
In terms of hepatic failure: On [**2126-11-17**] pt complained of RUQ
pain. A surgical consult was obtained and it was thought that
the pt had acute cholecystitis. He underwent lap chole on
[**2126-11-17**]. Vancomycin was added to abx regimen as above. On
[**2126-12-1**], bilirubin was found to be elevated to 2, direct bili
of 1.7. AP was ~1000, AST 89, ALT 60. LFTs steadily increased to
Tbili 3.8 and pt complained of abdominal pain. On [**2126-12-4**] pt
underwent ERCP and sphincterotomy where a small common bile duct
stone was retrieved. On [**2126-12-6**], bili rose to 5.3, AP to 1149,
Amylase 124, and lipase 485. WBC was 11.5. An abdominal CT was
done for concern of pancreatitis but was negative; there was
also no evidence of stones, nor dilatation of CBD. Over the next
days, Tbili rose and pt became quite jaundice with decreased PO
intake to bili of 13.8 on [**2126-12-20**] mainly direct.
.
Biopsy of the liver was done on [**2126-12-19**]; results were
non-specific and showed only periportal inflammation. Prednisone
was started by the liver service in an attempt "to treat his
hepatic inflammation." Hepatitis panel was negative. On [**2126-12-24**]
pt became more lethargic and concern was for protection of
airway. He was reintubated. Multiple code discussions had and pt
remained a full code.
.
He was weaned from ventilator on [**2126-12-26**] and extubated. Pt had
a PEG tube placed a few weeks ago, but has had high residuals
past few days. TPN reordered. KUB shows bowel gas pattern non
consistent with ileus. CXR showed persistent CHF. Of note, abx
switched in two days since d/c summary to below.
