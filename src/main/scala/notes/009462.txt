Brief Hospital Course:
1. Transient hypoxemia: Her transient hypoxemia was most likely
secondary to oversedating medications. There was no clinical
evidence to suggest brochospasm [**1-2**] to preexisting asthma, and
cardiac enzymes were negative ruling out an ischemic event. CXR
was unremarkable. She was monitored in the ICU overnight, and
saturated well overnight and by discharge was sating 98% on RA.
.
2. HTN: Her home dose of HCTZ was restarted on the day of
discharge. Her SBP in 120-130.
.
3. Bradycardia: While monitored overnight on telemetry, patient
was noted to be bradycardic to 40's. She was sleeping and
asymptomatic the entire time. Once awak, she returned to HR
60's. This was felt to be most likely secondary to decreased
vagal tone. In addition, she was noted to have two episodes of
reflex tachycardia to HR 100 for a few seconds. There was
concern for tachbrady syndrome vs. wandering ectopic pacemaker.
The tachcardic episodes were not documented on EKG. She was
advised to follow-up with her primary care physician regarding
her bradycardia.
.
4. Ampullar adenoma: The ERCP was aborted. Per ERCP, she should
reschedule the procedure as an outpatient.
.
5. GERD: continue PPI
.
6. FEN: regular diet
.
