Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Right flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Percutaneous Nephrostomy Tube Placement

History of Present Illness:
89 F with hx of bladder cancer s/p urostomy 7 years ago, hx of
CAD, HTN, COPD and HL who presents to an OSH with new R sided
flank pain. At OSH, was found to have 5 mm R distal ureteral
stone and a positive UA. She was transferred her for further
management.
.
She developed her pain around midnight and has been without
fever or chills per the patient. She has been nauseated with dry
heaves and has not taken PO since last PM. She has noticed
decrease urostomy output since her pain started. It did not have
any blood or pus.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98, P 88, BP 97/79, R 18 and
97% on RA. He received levofloxacin 750 mg IV at the outside
hospital. He received vanco 1 gm. She was ordered for cefepime
but did not receive it secondary to timing. She also received a
total of 500 cc IVFs at the OSH and 3 L IVFs in our ED. She got
4 mg IV morphine and 4 mg IV zofran in the ED, too.
.
She initially went to IR were she was found to be mildly
tachypneic and coughing. Her O2 saturations were normal on 2L
NC. She did have successful placement of a percutaneous
nephrostomy tube. She received 100 mcg fentanyl and 0.5 mg
versed. She was prone the entire procedure and had her O2 turned
up from 2L to 4L and had her sats in the low 90s the entire
time.
.
On arrival to the floor, she is having respiratory distress and
SOB. She is tripoding in her bed. She has no pain but just
cannot get comfortable. She received a nebulizer, 2 mg IV
morphine, 20 mg IV lasix and 4 mg IV zofran during this acute
process. She seemed more comfortable after the treatments.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 41676**] is an 89 y/o woman with a h/o of COPD, CAD, HTN,
CVA, and bladder cancer s/p urostomy placed 7 yrs ago in
[**State 33977**] who presented with sepsis and post-obstructive
pyelonephritis.
.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): Her initial
respiratory distress was most likely due to splinting [**2-20**]
abdominal pain from pyelonephritis and sepsis and then continued
after her infection was treated due to volume overload from
fluid resuscitation. She responded well to diuresis with Lasix,
which was started on [**7-31**] and d/c'ed on [**8-4**] because pt was
developing contraction alkalosis. Given pt's history of valvular
disease, Cardiology was consulted; they recommended maintaining
good control of heart rate given patient??????s valvular disease. She
was started on Diamox on [**8-5**] for her contraction alkalosis;
this resolved and Diamox was then D/C'd.  By time of discharge,
she was stable on 2L O2 by nasal cannula.
.
SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION): She was hypotensive
upon arrival to the unit, likely due to early sepsis from
pyelonephritis. She was started on pressors at admission; these
were d/c'ed on [**7-29**]. Lactate improved from 3.1 to 0.9. Diltiazem
was restarted at low dose on [**7-30**] to treat her ectopy (repeated
runs of PVCs), and her blood pressures returned to near
baseline.
.
PYELONEPHRITIS: Pt had stranding and an obstructing renal stone
on imaging and a positive U/A on presentation. OSH urine culture
showed Klebsiella and Morangella both sensitive to ceftriaxone
and cipro. Her urine cx here grew Enterococcus that was
sensitive to vanco, ampicillin, tetracycline, and
nitrofurantoin. This was consistent with post-obstructive
pyelonephritis. Pt was initially treated with meropenem and
Vancomycin; these were switched to Ampicillin and IV Cipro on
[**8-1**]. Leukocytosis improving, has been afebrile.  On the floor,
switched to PO ampicillin and cipro on [**8-6**].
.
NEPHROLITHIASIS (KIDNEY STONES): 5 mm obstructing stone causing
hydronephrosis. S/p IR drainage, followed by IR and Urology. IR
is deferring treatment of stone until course of abx completed,
will need anterograde lithotripsy/ureteroscopy as outpt, likely
week of [**8-12**].  Dr.[**Name (NI) 6444**] office will arrange follow up.
.
HTN: Pt restarted on home dose of 60 mg diltiazem QID, and added
captopril 12.5 mg TID.
.
RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): likely
secondary to obstruction, could be also secondary to poor
perfusion from question of early sepsis. Cr improved to
baseline.
.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
EMPHYSEMA) WITHOUT ACUTE EXACERBATION: has hx of COPD, not on
oxygen at home; had increased O2 requirement here, likely from
fluid overload rather than COPD exacerbation. Received nebs PRN
for wheezing, SOB.  Transitioned from BiPap to face mask to NC
and O2 titrated down.
.
HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC:
