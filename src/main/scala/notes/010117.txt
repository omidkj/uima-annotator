Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization and bare metal stent placement to right
coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
70M h/o DM2, hyperlipid, traumatic brain injury, c/b mental
retardation, asthma, hypothyroidism, doing well until just
before [**Holiday 944**], when noted to have increased non-productive
cough, progressively worse until [**1-30**], when pt was started on
9d course of prednisone(60x3d, 40x3d, 20x3d) for presumed asthma
flare. He was doing well until [**2177-2-12**] when sister notes markedly
increased fatigue ("in bed all day") and decreased appetite. One
episode of ?vomit vs cough on [**2-12**]. Pt denied
cp/sob/palp/diaphrosis. On [**2-15**] sister was concerned about
persistent fatigue, and noted worsening SOB when pt climbed
flight of [**Last Name (LF) 5927**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pt was brought to OSH ([**Hospital1 **]). While in
car pt complained of SOB.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital3 **] 13:45PM [**2177-2-15**], VS=97.5 138/76

Cardiac cath:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD had
no
angiographically apparent epicardial lesions.  The LCX had an
80% distal
lesion in OM1.  The RCA was totally occluded proximally with
heavy clot
burden.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial hypertension of 165/76 mm Hg.
3.  Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful thrombectomy and stentinf of the RCA with 3.0 X 23
mm and
2.5 X 12 mm Vision bare metal stents in an overlapping fashion
without
residual stenosis (see PTCA comments for detail).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute myocardial infarction with proximal RCA thrombus.
3. Moderate systemic arterial hypertension.
4. Successful stenting of the RCA with bare metal stents.
.
ECHO [**2177-2-17**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal inferior
and inferolateral segments. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Mild prolapse of
the anterior mitral leaflet, moderate to severe prolapse of the
posterior mitral valve leaflet. Moderate MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] LV
systolic dysfunction. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, TO BE REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS:
.
70 M h/o DM, hyperlipid, traumatic brain injury, asthma,
transferred from OSH after 3d fatigue, decreased appetite, with
new inferior STE, junctional rythym, found to have TO pRCA at
cath, s/p BMS x 2 to RCA.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: Presented with inferior MI s/p 2 BMS to RCA.
Also noted to have 80% occlusions of proximal OM1.  Initially
treated with heparin gtt and integrilin (18hours post cath).
Started on high dose aspirin, plavix, and ace inhibitor. Treated
for short period of time with high dose statin as history of
myositis. Bblocker held initially in setting of bradycardia and
prolonged PR interval. Patient will need follow up stress
testing vs cardiac catheterization to evaluate lesion in OM1.
Beta blocker not started as patient's blood pressure was
borderline low.
.
# Pump: Echo completed which revealed EF of 50-55% with a
dilated and hypokinetic right ventrilcle mild [**Last Name (Titles) **] LV systolic
dysfunction. Started on an ACE for afterload reduction. Did not
require preload reduction with lasix as there was no evidence of
heart failure, either acute or chronic.
.
# Rhythm: Initially noted to be in junctional rhythm prior to
stent placement. Following revascularization, patient converted
back to sinus rhythm with borderline prolonged PR interval.
Beta blocker held initially as he was bradycardic. However it
was not started as blood pressure was borderline and would not
tolerate addition of another [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
.
# Valves: Noted to have myxomatous mitral valve leaflets, mild
prolapse of the
