Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfonamides / Dicloxacillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1865**]
Chief Complaint:
BRBPR and epistaxis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Biopsy of R leg lesion

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 86 yo female with PMH afib/aflutter on coumadin,
SSS, VT on last admission s/p pacer, CHF, HCM w/dynamic LVOT
with recent admission from [**Date range (1) 101938**] during which she had an
elevated INR 8.4 an epistaxis presenting with 1 day of BRBPR and
epistaxis. On morning of admission, she had an episode of BRBPR
and epitaxis which stopped after 1 episode. She noticed that she
felt some dripping in her nose and out some tissues in her nose
and when she took then out she ntoced they were bloody. Of note,
she says that she often picks at her nose, which results in nose
bleed. Also, she was straining to have a bowel movement. She has
had problems with constipation in the past which result in
BRBPR. She had only 1 episode of hard brown stool with BRB on
paper and in the toilet. She denies black stools, hematemesis,
N/V, dizziness, lightheadedness, hematuria. Her last colonoscopy
was on [**11-19**] and revealed rectal ulcers and a bowel regimen and
high fiber diet were recommended.
.
In the ED, BP 110/84 HR 64 RR 14 O2 sats 98% on RA. She was
typed and screened, 2 18 gauge PIVs were placed, she as given 1
liter NS and protonix 40 mg IV x1 and GI was consulted with plan
to see the patient in the AM.
.
On arrival to the ICU she denies CP, SOB, N/V, dizziness. She
does have some pain over her pace maker site as well as in her
abdomen where they have been giving her SC heparin injections.
.
She is now transferred to the floor as her hct stabilized. Gi
felt that her bleeding is most likely due to hemorrhoids or her
rectal ulcers in the setting of anticoagulation and
anti-platelet therapy, and would consider flex sig if she cont
to have bleed tomorrow. She was given 1 u pRBC this today for
hct 24.2-> 27.9


Past Medical History:
-Atrial fibrillation: on coumadin
-Sick sinus syndrome: temporary pacer placed during [**11-19**]
admission, was to return for permanent pacemaker placement,
which was again deferred during [**1-21**] admission secondary to
medical
illness and was placed during admission from [**Date range (1) 101939**]
-HOCM -> echo [**8-20**] showing LVOT obstruction (16 mm Hg) w/
increased gradient on Valsalva (63 mm Hg)
.
-CAD s/p NSTEMI s/p cath on [**2150-3-13**] which revealed three vessel
coronary artery disease. The LMCA had minimal ostial disease.
The LAD was a highly calcifed vessel with a 99% stenosis at the
take off of the diagonal. The diagonal branch had a 70%
stenosis. There was an 805 stenosis in the apical LAD. The LCx
was widely patent and highly calcified. The RCA was totally
occluded at the ostium and
filled via collaterals from the conus medullaris. There was
sustained ventricular tachycardia with hemodynamic collapse upon
injection of the LMCA follow by sucessful defibrillation with
200 Joules.
No stents were placed
-HTN
-Hyperlipidemia
-Chronic venous stasis
-Squamous cell carcinoma: right medial calf, s/p excision
[**11-19**], positive margins on 1st and 2nd excision attempts, needs
XRT to area 6 weeks after the wound heals.
-h/o UTI: last culture w/ enterobacter resistant to all but
bactrim and meropenem
-rectal ulcers: possibly from constipation and straining as
above
-History of C diff colitis
-Anemia: from blood loss after GI bleed, last HCT 25-30 in
[**11-19**], HCT 29.3 on discharge [**3-19**]
-NSTEMI [**1-21**], [**2-18**]

Small right pleural effusion, borderline interstitial edema and
subsegmental atelectasis at the left base are new. Moderate
cardiomegaly with particular left atrial enlargement is chronic.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads
present since [**3-17**] are unchanged in their respective
positions. The right ventricular lead does not extend as far as
the apex of the right ventricle. Heavy mitral annular
calcification and marked left atrial enlargement are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old female with a history of coronary artery disease s/p
recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in [**1-/2150**], atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, SSS, and HOCM with recent admission
significant for VT s/p pacer on [**3-16**], CHF, presenting with
epistaxis and BRBPR, episode of flash pulm edema now resolved.
Hospital course complicated by:
.
# ACUTE DYSPNEA/CHF:  Had an episode of likely flash pulmonary
edema in setting transfusion.  CE neg X 2.  Now resolved and
satting in high 90s on RA.  BNP elevated.
- diuresed over 2 days with furosmide 40 mg po each day with
good effect
- volume restrict to 1.5L daily
- will not add daily furosemide for now but may need this on an
ongoing basis
.
# BRBPR:  Now resolved.  Guiac negative.  Most likely due to
hemorrhoids or her rectal ulcers in the setting of
anticoagulation and constipation with straining during BMs. Post
1u pRBC transfusion on [**3-23**] with appropriate increase in Hct and
hemodynamically stable. Spoke with EP regarding peri-procedure
prophylactic antibiotics and they generally do not recommend abx
for such procedures post-ICD placement.  HOWEVER, flex sig was
cancelled finally as she is now guiac negative.  Her hct was
stable X > 48 hrs
- cont to hold coumadin but re-started ASA 81 mg, Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
will likely restart coumadin in a month or so once stable
- po PPI
- cont bowel regimen
.
# EPISTAXIS: Currently resolved. Required nasal packi
