History of Present Illness:
46 y/oF with PMH of [**Doctor Last Name 27210**] syndrome on longterm [**Hospital 89608**]
transferred to the CCU following STEMI s/p DES to LAD.
.
Symptoms started with stuttering chest discomfort x 2 days,
described as left shoulder, back and arm burning rated [**4-28**].
Discomfort resolved spontaneously with no associated symptoms.
This am, patient awoke at 3am with nonresolving L shoulder pain
associated with with diaphoresis.  No N/V, dyspnea, or other
complaints.
.
In OSH ED, initial EKG showed STE in V1-V3 and aVL.  Initial
labs were notable for WBC of 13.2 and negative troponin.
Patient was given ASA 325mg, plavix 600mg and heparin gtt with
bolus and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Urgent cardiac catheterization (balloon time 5:18) showed
100%thrombus in LAD, proximal to the diagonal, distal to the 1st
septal.  Received [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 1 with restoration of flow.  Right heart
cathterization showed: RAP 14  RV 46/6 PA 40/24 PAWP 25 CI 1.9.

[**2144-3-17**]:
Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
free of
angiographically significant disease. The LAD was occluded
distal to the
great septal and proximal to the first diagonal vessel. The LCx
and RCA
were free of angiographically significant disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevation of left (PCW mean
25mmHg) and
right sided (RVEDP 19mmHg) filling pressures with mild pulmonary
artery
hypertension (mean PASP 35mmHg with PASP 46mmHg). The cardiac
index was
depressed at 1.9 L/min/m2 with an elevated SVR at 2071
dynes*sec*cm-5.
PVR was also elevated at 235 dynes*sec*cm-5.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease with LAD occlusion distal
to first
septal and proximal to the first diagonal with fresh thrombus.
2. Systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
.
[**2144-3-17**] ECHO:
Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is elongated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) with septal,
anterior and apical hypokinesis to akinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**3-17**] CXR (Portable)
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion.
2. Round density overlying the superior left hemithorax,
probable bone island. Recommend non-urgent lordotic views for
further evaluation.
.
[**2144-3-19**]
Limited ECHO to evaluate LV function:
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the mid to distal anterior
septum and anterior wall. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: mild to moderate regional LV systolic dysfuntion
consistent with mid-LAD infarction. The other segments are
hyperdynamic. No LVOT gradient seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 y/oF with PMH of [**Doctor Last Name 27210**] Syndrome on chronic HRT transferred
to the CCU following STEMI s/p DES to LAD

# CAD: Presented with STEMI to LAD and went to cath lab where a
DES was placed with no significant atherosclerosis in remainder
of coronary arteries.  Does have significant CAD as well as risk
factors including longterm hormone replacement therapy and
Turners Syndrome.  She was started on Aspirin, plavix,
metoprolol, and atorvastatin.  Her premarin was discontinued as
it puts her at risk for CAD.  ECHO showed left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) with
septal, anterior and apical hypokinesis to akinesis.  Hemoglobin
A1c was 5.6 and lipid panel showed Cholest 193 Triglyc 93 HDL 62
CHOL/HD 3.1, LDLcalc 112.  The patient was monitored on the
Cardiac ICU for over 24 hours and then she was transferred to
the cardiac
