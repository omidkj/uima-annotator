CXR [**2137-8-16**]
1. Multifocal opacities with a more confluent opacity in the
right upper lung field. These findings are worrisome for
multifocal pneumonia.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
3. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
.
Echo [**2137-8-16**]
Normal biventricular cavity size with normal regional and low
normal global left ventricular systolic function. Pulmonary
artery hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. These
findings are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (OSA,
COPD, etc.).
.
CT Chest [**2137-8-22**]
1. Multifocal pneumonic consolidation predominantly involving
the right upper lobe.
2. Moderate loculated effusion along right minor fissure and
minimal simple effusion bilaterally.
3. Borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Prominent right
hilar
appearance could be due to enlarged lymph node or from enlarged
vessles,
however defining a cause was limited due to lack to intravenous
contrast
administration.
4. Bilateral pleural calcifications. Please correlate with
clinical history for asbestos exposure. If a history is
established, follow-up imaging surveillance is recommended.
.
Dishcarge Chest xray [**2137-8-29**]:
In the interval from the prior examination, an endotracheal tube

has been removed and tracheostomy has been placed in standard
position.
Right-sided PICC is unchanged with tip reaching the low SVC.
There is no
significant change in multifocal opacities, greatest at the
right base. Trace pleural effusions may be present. No
pneumothorax is seen. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is not significantly changed.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old male with a history of COPD, DMII, CAD and HTN who
was admitted with respiratory failure and multifocal pneumonia.
.
# Respiratory failure: History of COPD, found to be hypoxic at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to 46% on 2L. CXR showed multifocal pneumonia. He
was given levofloxacin in the ED and was intubated. Febrile to
101 rectally in the ED. Failed extubation due to respiratory
fatigue, tachypnea, and worsening shortness of breath. He was
re-intubated and underwent bronchocopy. BAL revealed MRSA. IP
has was consu
