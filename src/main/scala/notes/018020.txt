None.


History of Present Illness:
57 y.o. Female with HCV cirrhosis, ESRD on HD s/p failed renal
transplant, seizure, HTN, recently dx ovarian mass,
hypothyroidism s/p thyroidectomy referred to the ED from HD for
hypotension. Admitted to ICU for hypotension.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 3671**] states over the past few days she has noted
intermittent episodes of lightheadedness particularly
orthostasis symptoms, she denies any episodes of syncope. She
was in dialysis today with a reported (per pt) systolic BP 108
laying down and mid 90s sitting she thinks she fell asleep
during dialysis. She woke up at the end of dialysis and not her
dialysis run was finished, the HD RNs were also next to her
telling her her BP was low. Per report from the ED her BPs in
dialysis were in ther 70s after her run, she was given 1L of NS
with no improvement with her BPs which is why she was referred
to the ED. She denies any consitutional symptoms such as nausea,
vomiting, fevers, chills. She does endorse a 5 day history of
sore throat, rhinorrhea which has now improved. She has also had
a dry cough x 3 days. She denies any SOB or DOE. She states that
she has been under a lot of stress over the passt few days, she
lives at home with her sister who is 'unstable' and lead to them
having to move out. She has been trying to move out of her place
for the past few days. Due to the stress she states she is not
eating or drinking as much but denies feeling dehydrated.
.
In the ED initial VS were noted to be T97.8, HR 87, BP 102/47,
RR 16, Sat 96% RA. In the room however she was noted to be
'[**Name6 (MD) 98153**] [**Name8 (MD) **] RN note and triggered for a BP 78/47, HR 82, RR
12, Sat 100% on RA. Per ED signout pt was noted to have foggy
thinking but no evidence of chest pain, lightheadedness. Given
the level of hypotension which trended down to systolic of 69 a
rt femoral line was placed. Pt was given 1gm of Vancomycin, 2L
NS with a BP improvement to 89-93 systolic. An EKG showed SR 74
bpm, STD V3-V4, TWI V3-V6. Pt received and additional 2 L of NS
in the ED with BPs remaining 92/48, BP improved to 92/48 after 2
more litres of NS her BP was noted to be 101. In total pt
received 1L NS at HD and an extra 4L NS in the ED.
.
CXR in the ED showed linear scarring in lung bases that was
unchanged from priors. His initial labwork was notable for WBC
5.9, Hgb/Hct 12.1/35.4, plt 146. chem panel was notable for K of
6.2, BUN/Cr 13/3.3. Repear K was then 3.6 and then 2.9, lactate
1.7. Pt also 750mg Levofloxacin in addition to Vancomycin for
empiric coverage.
.
Of note she has been admitted twice over the past 2 months for
hypotension pre and post dialysis. Her first admission was
[**2129-4-23**] and was thought to be [**2-16**] aggressive BP regimen as
well as the pt inappropriately taking her medications. She was
taking nitroglycerin every day as opposed to PRN. She was also
noted to be hypothyroid, likely not adherent to her snythroid
medication. She was ruled out for adrenal insufficiency. Outpt
Nephrologist reports dry weight as 74kg. On [**5-12**] she was
referred to the ED for abdominal pain and triggered in the ED
for a BP in the 70s. Again her hypotension was easily corrected
with fluid and thought to be [**2-16**] BP regimen.

CXR [**2129-6-22**]:  Stable scarring of bilateral lower lungs. No acute
process.

EKG [**2129-6-22**]:  Sinus rhythm. Extensive ST-T wave changes are
non-specific although cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-5-20**] the ST-T wave changes
are slightly more prominent in the precordial leads. The other
findings are similar.

EKG [**2129-6-23**]:  Sinus rhythm. Non-specific inferior and anterior T
wave changes. Cannot exclude ischemia. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2129-6-22**] no diagnostic interim change.

TTE [**2129-6-23**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. No clinically significant valvular
regurgitation or stenosis. Normal pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-2-20**],
mild mitral regurgitation is no longer present and the pulmonary
artery systolic pressure has normalized.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 y.o. Female with a history of HTN, HCV cirrhosis, ESRD on HD
s/p failed renal transplant, seizure d.o., depression,
hypothyroidism, substance abuse referred to the ED for
hypotension at dialysis. Admitted to the ICU for hypotension.
.
# Hypotension:  Pt admitted with systolic BPs in the 70s with
improvement to 100s after 5L of NS. On review of Ms. [**Known lastname 21913**]
history in OMR this is the 3rd time she has presented to the ED
with BPs in the mid 70s requiring ICU care. On review of the
discharge summaries, her prior work ups have included infectious
(with neg cx), adrenal insufficiency ([**4-/2129**] [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim to 32.1
from 7.8). She has been noted to have TSH >100 and 5.6 in the
past; however most recent TSH was improved. There concerns that
this may be medication-related given she is taking multiple
medications for pain which may cause hypotension, but the
patient reports compliance with her medication regimen.  During
this admission, the patient's episode
