Date of Birth:   [**2106-6-2**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 33-year-old man
who had complaints of a headache on [**2139-6-20**].  He was seen at
an outside emergency room with increased blood pressure and
visual disturbances.  He was sent home with prescriptions for
medication for his blood pressure and allergies and returned
with severe headache on [**2139-6-23**].  He had again hypertension
and visual changes and was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] after a head CT showed subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Asthma.  2. Spina bifida with
ventriculoperitoneal shunt as a child.  3. Hypertension.  4.
Renal failure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was awake,
alert, oriented x 3 with no pronator drift, moving all
extremities with good strength.  His vital signs were stable.
His temperature was 101.1.  He was on 0.3 mcg of Nipride to
keep his blood pressure less than 140-150.

LABORATORY DATA:  His white count was 12.4, hematocrit 37.7,
platelet count 338.  INR was 1.2, patient 13.6, PTT 22.6.
Sodium 139, K 4.0, chloride 104, CO2 23, BUN 22, creatinine
0.9, glucose 135.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a headache and on [**2139-6-25**]
was taken to angiography which showed a ruptured right A1-A2
junction aneurysm with severe radiographic vasospasm.  The
patient had a coiling of this aneurysm and papaverine along
wiht intracranial angioplasty for severe vasospasm.  Post
angiography the patient was sedated.  His gaze was conjugate.
Pupils were 2.5 down to 2 bilaterally, minimally reactive.  He
had no withdrawal to painful stimulation and no spontaneous
movements.  His reflexes were decreased throughout.  He had
positive pedal pulses.  His groin site was clean, dry and intact
postoperatively.  The patient had the Acom aneurysm
coiled and bilateral carotid MCA angioplasty for vasospasm.

On postprocedure day number one the patient did not respond
to voice, no response to pain.  Pupils were 3.5 down to 3 and
brisk.  He had forward gaze.  The patient had a vent drain
placed and a head CT which showed no evidence of new
hemorrhage, but some evidence of questionable right frontal
infarct.  The patient spiked to 103.1 on the 22nd and was
fully cultured.

On [**2139-6-26**] the patient was awakened to examination, withdrew
the right and left upper and lower extremities, withdrew the
right greater than left upper extremity, question of
localizing to pain in the uppers.  Neurologically he was
improving.  He was continued to be intubated, somewhat
lightly sedated and was kept on triple H therapy keeping his
central venous pressure greater than 10 and his blood
pressure 170-190 to help with vasospasm.

On [**2139-6-28**] the neurological examination was unchanged.  The
patient had minimal lateral movement of the upper extremities
to pain and constant nonpurposeful movement of the lower
extremities.  He withdrew to pain.  His pupils were 2 mm and
reactive.  He had intact cough, gag, and corneals.  His ICP
drain remained at 5 cm above the tragus with a moderate
amount of serosanguinous drainage.  The patient did not open
his eyes or follow commands.  He continued to be hyperdynamic
and kept hypertensive for treatment of vasospasm.

On [**2139-7-1**] the patient began following commands, opening his
eyes spontaneously, tracking with his eyes, nodding his head
"yes" and "no" appropriately, would grasp with the right hand
but not with the left.  He moved both legs freely and off the
bed but no to command.  The patient was extubated on [**2139-7-2**]
and tolerated this well.

On [**2139-7-8**] the patient went for arteriogram which showed
good coiling of the aneurysm, though some persistent vasospasm.

On [**2139-7-10**] the patient's vent drain was removed.  The
patient was kept in the intensive care unit over the weekend.
He was awake, alert, oriented x 3, following commands x 4.
He had a feeding tube place for inability to swallow and was
transferred to the floor on [**2139-7-13**].  He was awake, alert
and oriented x 3, moving all extremities with good strength
with still some residual left-sided weakness and left drift.
The patient failed swallow evaluation and therefore had a
feeding tube in place which he pulled out.  Reevaluation was
performed on [**2139-7-15**] and those results are pending.
