History of Present Illness:
55-year-old male with hx of HTN and hx of "bacterial infection
in blood" in [**2143**] who presented today to ED with 4-5 days of
worsening dyspnea, general malaise, and myalgias.  Pt reports
that he was in his usual state of health when he developed
flu-like symptoms 4-5 days ago with myalgias, general malaise,
and poor appetite.  He began to then have progressively
worsening dyspnea, feeling short of breath even while walking to
the restroom.  Denies fevers, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea,
nasal congestion.  Pt reports he has already received the flu
shot this season.  Reports no family members are ill.  Denies
recent travel outside the country.  He is a former smoke, quit
25 years ago.
.
Of note, pt also states that he was diagnosed with a bacterial
infection in his blood in [**2143**] and treated at [**Hospital1 2025**].  CT chest was
performed at [**Hospital1 18**] after discharge for follow-up on [**2143-12-16**] that
showed paraseptal/centrilobular emphysema (could not rule out
neoplasm of left lower lobe), multiple pulmonary nodules.
Subsequent follow-up CT chest on [**2144-2-19**] showed decreased size
of left lower lobe lesion and unchanged pulmonary nodules.  It
was recommended that he undergo repeat CT chest one year later
but this was never done.
.
In the emergency room, initial vitals were 99  172/81  92  14
95%RA. The patient received 750mg po levofloxacin and 1g IV
ceftriaxone.

Vitals prior to transfer were: 99.0, 86, 162/93, 16, 91%
.
On the floor, pt complains of myalgias (particular lower back
pain), fatigue, lightheadedness.

[**2145-11-6**] 08:15AM BLOOD IGG SUBCLASSES 1,2,3,4-PENDING

CXR (PA & LAT) [**2145-10-29**]:
FINDINGS:
The lung volumes are low. Bilateral mid and lower lung zone
opacities are
consistent with multifocal pneumonia. There is mild vascular
congestion and a small right pleural effusion as well as small
amount of fluid in the major fissure. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hila are normal. There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral mid and lower lung zone opacities are consistent with
multifocal pneumonia.

CTA chest [**2145-10-29**]:
FINDINGS:
AIRWAYS AND LUNGS: Airways are patent to subsegmental bronchi.
Diffuse,
centrilobular emphysema is moderately severe. Biapical bulla
along the
mediastinal aspect are unchanged since [**2144-4-4**]. Bilateral,
perihilar
predominant ground-glass opacities and bibasal lung
consolidations are present in the background of emphysema.
Differential diagnosis include resolving pulmonary edema or
multifocal infection. Though similar appearance can be seen in
pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia, given the clinical history, it is less likely. There
is no pleural effusion
