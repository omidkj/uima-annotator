Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis
Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 65 yo M with PMH significant for dilated CM with EF of
30-35%, afib, BiV [**First Name3 (LF) 3941**] in [**6-28**] p/w pericardial effusion on echo
admitted for pericardiocentesis. Pt. was recently seen at [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 620**] at which time he was experiencing
intermittent chest discomfort. Patient mentions that his SOB had
been getting worse on exertion, and found it difficult to make
it to his car. In addiion, he has had intermittent right sided
chest pain that radiates to the left side of his chest. He is
known to have atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone. His [**Last Name (Titles) 3941**]
was tested on [**2195-8-18**], and at that time, he was converted
from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm with DCCV. On device
interrogation on [**2195-9-2**] it appeared he remained in sinus
rhythm for several days and had since reverted back to atrial
fibrillation with slow ventricular response between 50-100 bpm.
Patient denied lightheadedness, dizziness, presyncope, actual
syncope, shortness of breath at rest. The patient had baseline 2
pillow orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient
is on Coumadin for a history of atrial arrhythmias, and has had
INR values that have been within the therapeutic range.
.
During this admission, on echo demonstrated a larger
(moderate-sized) pericardial effusion. He underwent elective
percardiocentesis of 400cc bloody fluid. He was observed in the
CCU overnight s/p procedure and had the pericardial drain
removed on [**2195-10-29**]. A repeat echo showed a small loculated
effusion. He has been on heparin during his hospitalization for
afib and procedures. The EP service plans to perform repeat
DCCV.

Echo ([**2195-10-29**]):  Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears loculated. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-10-28**],
there is no change to the small loculated pericardial effusion
present posterior to the LV and the RA.

C Cath ([**2195-10-28**]):  FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful pericardiocentesis with removal of 400 cc of
serousangious
fluid and improvement in pericardial pressure from mean of 11 mm
Hg to 0
mmHg.
2- Elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of
13 mmHg
and PCWP of 20 mmHg (unchanged after tap).


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Pt is a 65 yo M with PMH significant for
dilated CM with EF of 30-35%, BiV [**Month/Day/Year 3941**] with pericardial effusion
and afib s/p pericardiocentisis.
.
#. Pericardial Effusion: Patient had a moderate sized
pericardial effusion echo on [**2195-10-14**] which showed a moderate
pericardial effusion that is circumferential. Patient is s/p tap
and had a residual small loculated effusion on echo [**2195-10-28**].
Restarted coumadin, patient was never symptomatic.  Has a
scheduled echo in one week to reassess loculated effusion.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a BIV pacemaker placed and
is v-paced. Also on home amiodarone for underlying atrial
fibrillation. Coumadin was held for tap, placed on heparin, then
discontinued heparin to coumadin when INR 2.0.  Had a successful
d/c cardioversion, and was discharged with follow up with
outpatient electrophysiologist.  Will also follow up his INR as
prior to admission, discharged on warfarin (initially given
vitamin K for pericardiocentesis).
.
#. CAD: Patient had his cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) **] of
[**2195**], had a stent placed to the LAD. No ischemic changes on EKG
noted, patient complained of mild chest pain on right side no
different than in the past which was relieved by sublingual
nitroglycerin.  Continued ASA, plavix, statin, Lisinopril, and
nitroglycerin.
.
#. Pump: Patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], echo on [**2195-10-28**]
demonstrated EF of 20-30%. Not wet on physical exam, patient
fluid restricting himself as well.  Continued carvedilol,
spironolactone, Digoxin.
.
#. BPH: Continued finasteride
