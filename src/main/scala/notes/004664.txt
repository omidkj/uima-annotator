Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheotomy change to cuffed 6 french cuff


History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 YOF with type I diabetes, morbid
obesity (wheelcheer bound), CAD s/p CABG, diastolic CHF,
sarcoidosis, asthma complicated by airway obstruction with
chronic uncuffed tracheostomy, and neurogenic bladder with
chronic indwelling urinary catheter who presented from home
after experiencing worsening dyspnea on [**2192-3-21**].  The pateint
states while watching TV she became more short of breath than
usual, took albuterol which, helped but not as much as should so
she came in.  She noted she had been having a productive cough
with brown sputum but no fevers.
.
In the ED her vitals were 98.3 85 131/67 20 95 (on home 02 of
2.5L).  Her CXR showed mild pulmonary edema, stable severe
cardiomegaly and a small left pleural effusion. Her creatinine
was 1.6 (up from baseline 1.1) so she was not given lasix.  EKG
showed some changes-diffuse ST flattening, now more depressed
inferior and laterally. The patient was given aspirin.  BNP was
5861 and the pt was admitted to medicine for CHF exacerbation.

ROS:
(+) As per HPI.  Pt denied HA, CP, cough, change in diet prior
to hospitalization ,medication noncompliance, fever, chills,
nausea, vomiting, or change in MBs.  She has urinary
incontinence at baseline and has a chronic catheter.
ROS:

Images:

EKG [**2192-3-23**]: Sinus tachycardia with increase in rate as compared
with previous tracing of [**2192-3-21**]. Atrial ectopy persists. There
is baseline artifact. The  ST-T wave changes are less prominent
but this may represent pseudonormalization. Clinical correlation
is suggested.
.
EKG [**2192-3-22**]: Sinus rhythm. Premature atrial contractions.
Borderline left axis deviation  with possible left anterior
fascicular block. Diffuse ST-T wave changes. Cannot rule out
myocardial ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing  of
[**2191-7-22**] inferior and anterolateral ST-T wave changes are more
prominent. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
Echo [**2192-3-21**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2192-3-22**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
unchanged
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Blunting of the left
costophrenic sinus, so that a small left pleural effusion cannot
be excluded. Unchanged low lung volumes, unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly. No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting
pneumonia.
.
[**2192-3-23**] CXR:
1. Moderate cardiomegaly with increased moderate pulmonary edema
compared to [**2192-3-22**]. 2. Retrocardiac opacity most
likely represents left basilar atelectasis. However, the
differential diagnoses in
