CT Neck on admission:
1. Large left retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal
abscess,extending to the
carotid space measuring 7.0 x 4.2 x 3.2 cm. Stranding in the
base
of the neck, but no definite extension into the mediastinum.
2. Significant mass effect on the oropharyngeal airway,
3. Compression of the left internal jugular vein, without
complete occlusion.
4. No osteomyelitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 18 year old male who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
with enlarging left neck mass with CT demonstrating a large
parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal abscess surrounding the great
vessels.  He was taken urgently to the OR for drainage.  He
underwent fiberoptic intubation and incision and drainage of the
abscess.  Intra-op findings notable for a well loculated abscess
in the parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal space as well as
lateral to the SCM. The left internal jugular vein was ligated
as it was involved in the abscess pocket.  A large amount of
purulent material was drained and three penroses placed in the
potential spaces. The patient tolerated the procedure without
immediate complications. For details, please see separately
dictated operative note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**]. Postoperatively,
the patient was kept intubated and taken to the ICU for closer
observation.

The remainder of his hospital course is reviewed here by
systems:

Wound: The patient had a horizontal incision left neck incision
with three penroses in place. The wound continued to be open and
drain during this period.  On POD #4, the patient underwent
repeat CT imaging of the neck in the setting of a slight rise in
his WBC to 12 and chest pain, which was negative for any
residual abscess or for evidence of mediastinitis. His symptoms
thereafter resolved. The penroses were slowly inched out daily
and removed on POD #7.  Following removal of the penroses, the
wound cavity was irrigated and then packed with 1-inch iodaform
strip gauze (10 cm) with plan for continued dressing changes
daily as an outpatient with assistance of VNA, as the cavity
slowly seals in.

Neuro: The patient's cranial nerves were fully intact following
the procedure.  His voice was strong and a post-op FOE
demonstrated bilateral, symmetric vocal cord mobility.  He was
noted to have a left-sided Horner's syndrome, without
significant functional compromise.  The patient's pain was
initially controlled with IV antibiotics. He was kept sedated
while on the ventilator.  Post-extubation, the patient was
transitioned to PO pain medications with good effect. By time of
discharge, the patient was requiring minimal narcotic pain
medications. He was given 0.5mg ativan as needed for anxiety
with good effect.

Resp:  The patient remained intubated in the ICU until POD#2. He
was extubated on this date without difficulty and subsequently
transferred to the floor. He was weaned off of oxygen by POD #4.
CT on [**2-3**], showed scattered opacities which were consistent
with aspiration or pneumonia. He received aggressive chest PT,
ambulation and incentive spirometry throughout his hospital
course and was satting >95% by time of discharge.

CV: The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his
hospitalization. He complained of transient left chest pain on
[**2-3**] with EKG showing ? of T-wave inversions in lateral leads.
His cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative x 3.  His symptoms
resolved.  CT performed on this date showed no evidence of
mediastinitis.

ID: The infectious disease department was consulted and they
recommended Unasyn, Clindamycin and vancomycin as emperic
coverage initially, which was subsequently simplified to
Unasyn/Vancomycin.   The patient had repeat imaging on [**2177-2-3**]
which demonstrated a well drained abscess pocket without
evidence of mediastinal involvement or residual abscess.  The
patient remained afebrile and his WBC trended down for the
remainder of the hospitalization. Per ID, the patient is being
dicharged on Ertapenem and Vancomycin to complete a 14 day IV
course, and thereafter transition to moxifloxacin for additional
14 days or as instructed further by ID.

GI: The patient was NPO until extubation.  Thereafter, his diet
was advanced to regular, which he tolerated without coughing or
difficulty.

GU: The patient had a foley in place which was discontinued
following extubation. He voided without issue.

Endo: No issues.

Heme:  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout
his hospitalizaiton. He received SQH throughout his hospital
course and was ambulating the halls frequently.

The remainder of the hospital course was uneventful; the patient
remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. His pain was well
controlled on oral pain medications. By the day of discharge, on
[**2177-2-7**], he was tolerating a regular diet, able to void without
difficulty and ambulate without assistance. He and his family
expressed the readiness and desire to go home and was discharged
to home with VNA services for dressing changes and IV
antibiotics, on POD # 8, [**2177-2-7**], with instructions to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle)
