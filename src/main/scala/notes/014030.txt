Rehabilitation Center postoperatively.  At the center, he
developed dysphagia and difficulty swallowing.  At that time,
the patient also retired acute urinary retention.  Foley was

dysphagia and the management of the hematuria through the
Urology Department.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is widowed.  He is a former
[**Location (un) 86**] [**Male First Name (un) 17703**] employee.  He has a 20 pack year history of
tobacco, currently does not smoke.  He lived with his son
previous to his hospitalizations.

INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.7, blood
pressure 143/68, heart rate 66, respiratory rate 20, and
oxygen 100% on 2 liters.  On examination, the patient is an
elderly man.  Pupils are equal and reactive.  Extraocular
muscles were intact.  Cranial nerves III through XII were
intact.  Neck was supple.  Lungs:  Bilateral crackles in the
lower lobes.  Cardiac:  Regular, rate, and rhythm.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended.

INITIAL HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was reassessed during
the hospitalization.  Had a video swallow.  The patient was
noted to have marked difficulty handling any sort of fluid
boluses, and thus was made NPO.  At that point, the patient
was evaluated for placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy
tube by Interventional Radiology.  Patient is also worked up
by ENT, and found to have no anatomic abnormalities, and the
CT scan was recommended of his head to evaluate for
cerebrovascular accident, which was subsequently negative.

Urology managed a Foley with a three-way catheter.  Hematuria
resolved over time and the three-way catheter was then
changed to a standard Foley catheter.  He was further
evaluated on [**2193-2-4**] by Speech and Swallow, which
recommended diet of thin liquids, solids, and crushed pills
with apple sauce.

Later in the patient's hospitalization stay, he became septic
and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  At that
time, Cardiothoracic Surgery took over the care of the
patient.  General Surgery was asked to consult on the patient
as was Cardiothoracic Surgery due to an inflamed and
erythematous sternal wound.

On the [**1-13**], the patient was brought to the
operating room, and evaluated for the infection.  The sternum
and xiphoid area was debrided, and it was noted that the G
tube passed through the sternal wound and into the stomach.
General Surgery recommended that the G tube be removed and a
second G tube be placed via an open incision.

Patient tolerated the procedure well, and was transported to
the CSRU in stable condition.  The patient continued on
antibiotics and Intensive Care Unit management.  On the [**1-20**], the patient was brought to the operating room by
Plastic Surgery for a sternal wound debridement and a right
pectoral advancement flap.  Prior to the surgery, the patient
was treated with wet-to-dry dressing changes.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13797**]
and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] debrided the sternal area, used a left
sided advancement flap and placed three [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well.  There was no
complications, and the patient was transferred to the CSRU in
stable condition.

Following the debridement and flap, the patient continued to
require ventilation.  On the [**1-6**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] operated on the patient with their preoperative
diagnosis of postoperative respiratory insufficiency and
tracheobronchitis, wet secretions, and hemoptysis.  The
patient had a percutaneous tracheostomy tube placed, and the
flexible bronchoscopy and tracheobronchial aspiration was
done at the same time.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well.

Shortly thereafter, the patient became septic, required
pressors.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] brought the
patient back to the operating room for an exploratory
laparotomy to rule out sepsis as a CT scan showed
inflammation of the colon.  During the hospitalization, the
patient did suffer from Clostridium difficile and was treated
with Vancomycin and also Flagyl.  It was thought that prior
to going to surgery, that this might be necrotic due to the
CT scan.  Via a midline incision, the patient was explored.
The colon looked dusky and consistent with a colitis, but was
viable.  The gallbladder was nondistended and appeared
normal.  It was felt at that time that the patient's sepsis
was not due to abdominal source.

The patient was then closed with staples and returned to the
Cardiac Surgery Unit for ongoing therapy.  During this time,
the patient was continued on Impact with fiber at 100 cc an
hour of tube feeds for nutritional support.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
consulted during the patient's hospitalization stay for
nutritional care.

On the [**1-7**], the patient had a bronchoscopy which
showed upper airway drainage with mucus with no major
abnormalities.

Renal was asked to see the patient for acute renal
insufficiency.  They felt that the patient was prerenal, and
recommended renal dosing of medications and increased
titration.  Plastic Surgery was reconsulted during the [**Month (only) 958**]
period for decubitus ulcer, which was debrided by them at the
bedside.  Patient during this course was continued on
antibiotics to treat positive cultures.

On the [**1-13**], the patient was treated with Zosyn,
fluconazole, Vancomycin po and IV.  At that time the patient
had MRSA in his wound, [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans in his wound, [**Female First Name (un) 564**]
parapsilosis in the sternum.  The patient is also Clostridium
difficile positive and VRE positive in the stool.

During the end of [**Month (only) 958**], the patient stabilized and was
slowly taken off antibiotics.  During that time the patient
was continued on tube feeds and was supported with Physical
Therapy.  The patient also had a Psychiatry consult, and
their impression was he suffered from delirium which is
multifactorial with underlying dementia and depression.  They
recommended minimizing the opiates and anticholinergics and
continue with general antidepressant medications.

At the beginning of [**Month (only) 956**], the patient was transferred to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit service for further
management.  At that time, the patient's antibiotics were
weaned off without spiking temperatures

On the [**1-10**], the patient became hyponatremic and had
his tube feeds and fluids adjusted appropriately.  The
patient was also given sodium po until his sodium reached a
level greater than 130.  During that time, it was decided
that the patient would be able to be discharged to
rehabilitation services.  Plastic Surgery consulted to
evaluate the sacral decubitus ulcer.  They recommended local
debridement as necessary, and to continue the Santyl.

During the beginning of [**Month (
