acute development of word finding difficulty. The pt's
granddaughter, who lives with him, called the PCP this evening

complaints about any other S/S but does not wish to wake up. He
has been increasingly groggy
over the past week but today is most pronounced. PCP thought it
might be side effect of remeron, which was recently started, so
recommended stopping remeron, but when patient became markedly
confused after awaking from a nap, family brought him to the ED
and Code Stroke was called for concern of aphasia.

In the ED, he was alert, speech production was similar to
baseline according to the family. Neurology/stroke team saw
patient but exam was nonfocal. Labs, however, were remarkable
for Hct 18 and INR 5.8. Pt received 2 units of PRBCs and vitamin
k 5mg IV. Nurse's notes do report an episode of melena. The
family refused foley placement, citing difficulty with voiding
upon removal of foley in the past. VS prior to transfer were

Pertinent Results:
EGD: [**2178-12-27**]
Esophagus:
-Lumen: A small size hiatal hernia was seen, displacing the
Z-line to 40cm from the incisors, with hiatal narrowing at 42cm
from the incisors.
Stomach:
-Mucosa: Patchy erythema, granularity and congestion of the
mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the antrum and fundus.
These findings are compatible with mild gastritis.
-Flat Lesions: A few small angioectasias that were not bleeding
were seen in the stomach body. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied
for hemostasis successfully.
-Other: There was no blood seen in the stomach or duodenum.
-Duodenum: Normal duodenum.

IMPRESSIONS:
Small hiatal hernia
Angioectasias in the stomach body (thermal therapy)
Erythema, granularity and congestion in the antrum and fundus
compatible with gastritis
There was no blood seen in the stomach or duodenum.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

.
CT HEAD:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
Cardiac echo:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-4-29**],
the degrees of tricuspid regurgitation and aortic stenosis have
increased slightly. The other findings are similar.
.
CXR [**12-29**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the
cardiac
silhouette is somewhat more prominent, given that this
represents a PA rather than AP view. There is also increased
prominence and indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels,
consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. No definite
acute pneumonia.
