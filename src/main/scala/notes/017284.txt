Admission Date:  [**2145-8-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2145-9-5**]


Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old
Russian female with coronary artery disease, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypercholesterolemia, who
presented with chest pain and dyspnea on exertion.  The
patient had known three vessel disease diagnosed on cardiac
catheterization in [**2138**] and managed medically since that
time.

During a preoperative workup for a hemicolectomy last year,
the patient had an exercise tolerance test that was
significant for a limited exercise tolerance and ischemic ST
segment changes with focal left ventricular systolic
dysfunction in the absence of anginal type symptoms, thought
to be consistent with inducible ischemia.  She was admitted
and ruled out for a myocardial infarction in [**2144-7-21**].
Her angina equivalent was dyspnea on exertion and her
exercise tolerance was about one quarter of a mile walking
before needing to stop and rest.  Prior to that admission,
she had only occasional chest pain on exertion, usually brief
and responsive to rest or one sublingual nitroglycerin.
Since then, she had no chest pain but worsening dyspnea on
exertion.

Approximately three days prior to admission, the patient
experienced her usual shortness of breath accompanied by
nonradiating chest discomfort described as a tightness with
pressure but not necessarily pain, which lasted approximately
two hours.  She took two sublingual nitroglycerin tablets,
which helped alleviate the symptoms.  The episode was not
associated with diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, syncope or
lightheadedness.  Since then, she had two additional episodes
of the shortness of breath, but not with the associated chest
discomfort.  The patient had three pillow orthopnea for many
years, as well as chronically edematous ankles.  The review
of systems was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient was referred to the [**Hospital1 188**] emergency department by her primary care physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 9346**], for presumed unstable angina.  In the emergency
department, the patient was not experiencing shortness of
breath or chest discomfort.  An electrocardiogram done at
that time was unremarkable for ischemic changes.  The patient
was subsequently admitted for suspicion of a myocardial
infarction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, as described.
2.  Diabetes mellitus times one year, treated with Glyburide.
3.  Chronic hypertension.
4.  Chronic hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Gout.
7.  Colon cancer, status post hemicolectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Nadolol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Synthroid 0.150 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Accupril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Nifedipine 30 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Nitrodisc 0.6 mg/hr transdermal patch q.d.
9.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.o.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile
with a heart rate of 60, a blood pressure of 150/80, a
respiratory rate of 16 and an oxygen saturation of 96% on
room air.  The jugular venous pressure was normal.  Carotid
pulses had a normal upstroke without bruit.  The lungs were
clear.  The heart had a regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI
systolic murmur at the left sternal border.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender and nondistended.  The extremities were warm
and well perfused with mild edema bilaterally at the ankles.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
service and was subsequently ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.  A cardiology consultation was obtained and the
consultant recommended a new cardiac catheterization to
assess the patient's coronary artery disease.  The results of
that study demonstrated a calcified aorta and coronary
arteries with an ejection fraction of approximately 60%.  The
results of that study demonstrated a 100% occlusion of the
mid right coronary artery, a 60% stenosis of the left main
coronary artery, a 100% stenosis of the distal left anterior
descending artery, a 50% stenosis of the proximal left
anterior descending artery, a 90% stenosis of the mid
circumflex coronary artery and an 80% stenosis of the third
obtuse marginal artery.  Based on these results, the
cardiothoracic surgery service was consulted and it was
recommended that the patient undergo coronary artery bypass
surgery.

There was a complication from the cardiac catheterization
done on [**2145-8-26**] that consisted of a suspected right
groin hematoma.  The patient went down for an ultrasound of
the right groin at the same time that she was having her
carotid arteries studies.  There was no evidence of a
hematoma, arteriovenous fistula or pseudoaneurysm in her
right groin.  Her carotid ultrasound results were significant
for a 60-70% stenosis of both the right and left internal
carotid arteries.  She was noted to have normal antegrade
flow in her right and left vertebral arteries.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course prior to surgery was
complicated by a declining hematocrit, requiring transfusions
of packed red blood cells.  Her surgery was delayed,
therefore, until the medical team could stabilize her
hematocrit and determine the etiology of her blood
requirement.

On [**2145-8-21**], she underwent an abdominal CT scan
which demonstrated a 5 x 12 cm right pelvic hematoma.  The
patient was managed medically for her retroperitoneal bleed
with serial transfusions of packed red blood cells in order
to maintain a hematocrit above 30.  By [**2145-8-30**],
the vascular surgery service had been consulted and deemed
her retroperitoneal hematoma to be stable and deemed it to be
safe to heparinize the patient for her coronary artery bypass
grafting.

On [**2145-9-2**], the patient underwent an uncomplicated
off pump coronary artery bypass grafting times three with a
left internal mammary artery graft to the first diagonal
artery, a saphenous vein graft to the second diagonal artery
and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
to the cardiac surgery recovery room, intubated and in good,
stable condition.  Overnight, she required two units of
packed red blood cells and remained intubated.

On postoperative day #1, the patient was afebrile and
hemodynamically stable, making good urine.  She was extubated
and subsequently transferred to the floor.  Once on the
floor, the patient remained stable.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was tolerating p.o.
intake as well as oral pain medication.  She was still making
adequate amounts of urine.  She was out of bed and ambulating
around her room.  Her Foley catheter and her antecubital
intravenous lines were removed.  On postoperative day #4, the
patient was deemed to be in stable condition and ready for
discharge to a rehabilitation center.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The neck was supple.  There were no
bruits.  The lungs were clear with slightly diminished breath
sounds bilaterally.  The sternum was stable.  The incision
was clean, dry and intact.  The heart had a regular rate and
rhythm with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left
sternal border.  The abdomen was soft, nontender and
nondistended.  The extremities were warm and well perfused.
The incision was clean, dry and intact.
