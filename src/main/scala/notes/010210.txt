Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**]
Chief Complaint:
headache, lethargy


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
 Right femoral pseudoaneurysm rupture with thigh hematoma.


History of Present Illness:
66yo left-handed man with recent R MCA stroke and multiple
vascular risk factors presents with difficulty seeing, change in
personality, and lethargy. On Saturday prior to admission he did
not seem himself to his wife; she felt he was quieter than usual
and more lethargic. She asked him what was wrong and he
complained of a headache on the right side of his head behind
his
ear. Throughout the next 5 days, he continued to complain of
headache and did not seem his usual self. He was quiet, sleeping
more than usual. He was not eating as much. He was having
difficulty "seeing" - for example, he would have to feel around
on the table for his fork. He dropped a spoon and potato and had
difficulty finding them. His wife thought this was mostly a
problem with things that were white or silver, but she was not
sure. He had difficulty telling time, difficulty with the big
and
little hand - thought 20 of 5 was 20 past 8. She also felt he
was
emotionally labile, acting silly more than normal, acting angry,
when usually he is eventempered. For example, he was walking up
the ambulance ramp to the ED when she heard a car behind them,
told him to move out of the way, and he stopped, shouted "leave
me alone!" He has not had any change in his speech, gait, or
weakness.

He has had a recent stroke for which he presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
with acute onset dysarthria and left facial droop, left hand
weakness. He was diagnosed with a right MCA infarct. MRI/MRA and
ECHO were performed (see reports below). He was newly diagnosed
with diabetes. He was started on medications for hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and more recently for hyperglycemia. He was put
on aggrenox, which he has been taking regularly. He has modified
his diet, but BS continue to be 129-173, mostly in the 160s
(fasting am). He has quit smoking.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal
affect. Oriented to person, place (hospital, ED, middle of
[**Location (un) 86**]), and date. Mildly inattentive, says [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] backwards to
[**Month (only) 958**], slowly. Speech is fluent with normal comprehension and
repetition; naming intact. Mild dysarthria. Reads "speak on the
radio last night" but can read full sentence when visually
prompted to the beginning; reads "near the table the dining
room." Writing intact (messy, but at baseline per wife).
Registers [**2-1**], recalls [**1-3**] +1 from list in 5 minutes. No
right-left confusion. No evidence of apraxia. Left visual
neglect. Describes pictures on stroke cards initially correctly
on right, but says "heart shape in circle" for key, and does not
initially mention hammock, just tree. With additional time
given,
then names skeleton key and hammock. Describes cookie thief
picture in parts, first notes the pitcher and plate, then the
small cabinet, then sink, then "young fellow climbing on
stepstool"; when asked how many people names the girl much later
than the others. Can identify it as kitchen. Difficulty with
drawing a house (draws roof, window on it, chimney with smoke,
but nothing else). Cannot copy complex picture (draws left side
of leftmost shape, with extensive spiral coming from it as
squiggle, but nothing else to the right.

Cranial Nerves: Fundoscopic examination reveals sharp disc
margins. Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 2 mm
bilaterally. No RAPD. Left inferior quadrantonopia. Extraocular
movements intact bilaterally without nystagmus. Sensation intact
V1-V3. Mild L facial droop. Hearing intact to finger rub
bilaterally. Palate elevation symmetric. Sternocleidomastoid and
trapezius full strength bilaterally. Tongue midline, movements
intact.

Motor: Normal bulk and increased tone bilaterally. No observed
myoclonus, asterixis, or tremor. Left pronator drift.

Coordination: finger-nose-finger, finger-to-nose slightly

Imaging:
ECHO [**7-7**] from d/c summary: "This reveals normal EF of 65%.
There is left ventricular hypertrophy.  The echo is consistent
with the presence of a patent foramen ovale."
<br>

HCT [**2111-12-3**] shows subacute infarct of right parieto-temporal
region, as well as more chronic infarct. Multiple chronic
lacunes.
<br>
CTA HEAD/NECK [**2111-12-3**]
1.  Findings consistent with embolus completely occluding the
proximal right
MCA.
  2.  Substantial focal narrowing of the basilar artery,
presumably due to
atheromatous disease.
  3.  Substantial calcification of the internal carotid arteries
bilaterally
in the cavernous sinus, and at the bifurcation of the common
carotid arteries
bilaterally.
  4.  60 percent stenosis of the right common carotid artery at
the
bifurcation.  No stenosis seen on the left.
<br>
.
MRI/A BRAIN [**2111-12-4**]:
MRI Head:
Right middle cerebral artery inferior division infarction
similar
to the appearance on the recent CT examinations.  No evidence of
hemorrhage.

Small bilateral occipital lobe infarctions suggesting basilar
artery disease, likely embolic to the top of the basilar.

MRA appears similar to the CTA with a severe stenosis of the M1
segment of the right middle cerebral artery as well as severe
narrowing and irregularity of the basilar artery.

CAROTID ANGIOGRAM [**2111-12-5**]:
PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room.
Anesthesia was induced in the supine position. Following this,
both groins were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The
right common femoral artery was accessed using a Seldinger
technique and a 6 French vascular sheath was placed in the right
groin. This was connected to a continuous saline flush. Through
the sheath, we now advanced [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2 catheter into the aortic
arch from where the left vertebral artery, the right internal
carotid artery and the right common carotid artery was
catheterized and AP lateral film
