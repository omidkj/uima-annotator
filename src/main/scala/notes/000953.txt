Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, LE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization- no intervention

History of Present Illness:
61 year old primarily Italian speaking male with known coronary
artery disease (s/p 3 vessel CABG in [**5-25**], and multiple PCI's on
both native and grafts), status-post re-PCI of SVG=>D2 in-stent
restenosis via Cypher DES on 12/[**2156**]. Also, has history of PVD,
HTN, DM, HLP, smoking history. Recently admitted
[**11/2157**]/6/[**2157**] for acute decompensated heart failure in the
setting of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Peak CK
2200, and troponin T 5.21 (baseline Cr 1.5), with troponin on
discharge 3.21. Patient had post-procedure echocardiogram on
[**2157-12-27**], which demonstrated no new MR with LV ejection fraction
35% (depressed from [**5-29**] EF 45%).

Since discharge on [**2157-12-30**], he has had intermittent dyspnea at
home, unclear if this was exertional or rest, which has been
increasing over the past 2 days. Associated with this SOB is
chest heaviness, no other symptoms (including no fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, ligtheadedness,
syncope, worsening LE edema).

He presented to [**Hospital 8050**] hospital on [**1-3**] in heart failure, and
was given 80 mg 80 IV lasix, morphine. He was started on heparin
drip for elevated cardiac enzymes (though decreaed since last
admission at [**Hospital1 18**]), and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for invasive
management. Here, heparin drip was discontinued (as cardiac
enzymes were decreased from prior) and he was given another 80
mg IV lasix and placed on nitroglycerin drip transiently for
pulmonary edema. Chest x-ray here was consistent with heart
failure. He was chest pain free on admission.

Cardiac Catheterization:
PROCEDURE DATE: [**2158-1-5**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease. Congestive heart failure. Dyspnea.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease with occluded
SVG-OM and
SVG-D.
2. Severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Preserved cardiac output / index.
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated native
three vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant
circulation.
The LMCA was without angiographically apprarent flow limiting
disease.
The LAD had moderate diffuse disease in the proximal and mid
vessel
without flow limitation. The diagonal branches were not
visualized. The
LCX was a small vessel with a mid-segment occlusion. The OM
branches
were not visualized. The RCA was a dominant vessel with a
proximal total
occlusion.
2. Graft angiography demonstrated that the SVG-D2 was occluded
distally
at the previously placed stent. The SVG-OM was occluded
proximally.
3. Right and left heart catheterization demonstrated elevated
right and
left sided filling pressures (RVEDP=15mmHG, mean PCWP=35mmHg,
LVEDP=35mmHg). Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension was
present.
Cardiac output and index were 4.5 L/min and 2.2/ L/min/m2
respectively. No transaortic gradient seen from catheter
pullback from
LV to ascending aorta.
4. Left ventriculography was not performed to reduce contrast
volume


Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, CABG, CHF, CRI, PAF p/w CHF exacerbation
.
1. CHF: Unclear precipitator, although he had a recent
pneumonia. His cardiac enzymes were elevated but down-trending
from previous admission. Unlear whether dietary indiscretion or
medical noncompliance were an issue, as patient did not know
what mediacations he [**Last Name (un) **] on. He came in with dyspnea and LE
edema. Had cardiac catheterization showing elevated right and
left sided pressures with PCWP of 35. His cardiomyopathy is
ischemic judging by wall motion abnormalities and his EF is 35%
by echo this admission. He did not have any intervention. He was
transfered to the CCU for tailored diuresis, where he diuresed
well with IV lasix. He self removed his femoral pressure
monitoring line, but not before two readings of PCWP around 20
were recorded. He diuresed over 2800 cc in two days in the CCU
and was transferred back to the floor for continued diuresis.
His IV lasix was changed to PO and he continued to diurese
appropriately. He was dicharged without LE edma, crackles, or
SOB.
.
2. CRI: He has elevated Cr in the past. His Cr was Cr 2.0 on
admission and 1.7 on discharge. It is thought to be due to CHF
on CRI, but there could be some component of dye induced
nephropathy.  He will need his Cr checked on his next office
visit to see if he is trending down.
.
3. CXR infiltrate: He had recently completed course of levoflox
for PNA. During his stay he had no fever or productive cough to
support pneumonia. He did have a mild leukocytosis but it was
down trending. Suspected to be atelectasis vs delayed
radiographic resolution of pna. he did not receive antibiotics.
.
4. Hyperkalemia: In setting of renal insufficiency. He was given
Kayexalate and Insulin and it normalized.
.
5. DM insulin dependent: He was continued on his home insulin
regimen of 50 units of 75/25 qam and qpm. He recieved RISS for
breakthrough coverage and was given a diabetic diet.
.
6. CAD: He was chest pain free throughout his admission. He was
treated with aspirin, plavix, toprol and imdur.
.
7. AFib: He has a history of afib but has not been in it for his
last two admissions. He presented without anticoagu
