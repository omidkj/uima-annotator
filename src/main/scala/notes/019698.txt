from [**Location (un) 620**] for lethargy, hypotension, hypothermia, and initial

BPs 90/50s responsive to 2L crystalloid. OSH w/u showed WBC 7,
baseline thrombocytopenia, Na 131, K 6.3 (improved 5.5 after
fluids), prerenal azotemia (35/1.1) without acidosis, normal
lactate (1.5) and LFTs. CXR reportedly normal. Dilantin level
15, nontoxic. ECG showed sinus bradycardia, prolonged PR, with
slowed ventricular conduction, no ischemia or signs of
hyperkalemia. UA with large pyuria, nitrite positive, presumed
infectiuos source. Empirically treated with 1g Vanc, 1g
ceftriaxone (h/o MRSA, yeast, candidal UTIs) prior to transfer.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T 95, HR 57, BP 127/68, RR 16, 98% on 2L NC (BP was
initially 80/40 but on recheck was found to be 120s/60s -
placement of cuff was questionable). Pt was nonverbal with
tremors, diffuse weakness, warm extremities but slightly
diminished pulses; no CVAT, abd benign.  Got 1L IVF. Put him on
warming blankets. Has been HD stable.  Bicarb 29 before IVF,
improved to 21 afterwards.  Repeat K 5.4.  Repeat Hct 32, likely
dilutional.  Repeat U/A with pyuria, nitrite negative.
Intermittently answering questions, wife coming in.  Alert and
responsive. Last BP 135/60 - brighter affect. Tx at family and
neuro request.

unable to obtain temp.  Pt is calm and cooperative, answering
questions only with nodding or shaking head.  Denies pain.  Does
not know why he is in the ICU.  Explained infection and need to
monitor BP and pt shook head in agreement.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 y/o M with MS, neurogenic bladder w/ [**Known lastname **]
[**Known lastname 54192**] foley and  [**Known lastname 16169**] UTIs who presents with
urosepsis.
.
## Klebsiella Urosepsis: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital **] after developing lethargy, hypotension, and
hypothermia. He received 1g Vanc and 1g ceftriaxone prior to
transfer.  n arrival here the patient was HD stable. Received 1L
IVF. Given a warming blanket for hypothermia. Mental status
improved and was answering questions. Admitted to the ICU for
hypothermia. In the ICU, the patient remained HD stable.
Switched to meropenem based on [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] urine culture
growing ESBL Klebsiella. Transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **] on
[**2112-12-21**].  On the floor the patient was hypothermic with
waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status. Placed on warming blanket and
vancomycin started. The following day the patient was febrile.
Transferred back to the ICU where the patient continued to be HD
stable.  Continued on vancomycin and meropenem and transferred
back to the [**Hospital1 **] on [**2112-12-23**].  He continued to improve
clinically from this point.  His WBC fell, however, and given a
prior question of whether vancomycin was causative, this was
discontinued as there were no culture results revealing any MRSA
infection, and clinical evidence of ongoing possible hospital
associated pneumonia was limited (no sob, fevers, chest pain,
cough). His cell counts recovered immediately after cessation of
the Vancomycin. Home IV therapy has been arranged so that he can
complete a total 14-day course of Meropenem via PICC line.
.
## Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia: This was attributed to
Vancomycin as stated above, which improved after Vancomycin was
stopped.
.
## Seizure disorder: During the hospitalization it was
recognized that medications initiated in the ICU and continued
on the floor had several errors as his home medication regimen
was identified to be different that the list maintained in OMR.
He was erroneously receiving keppra with dilantin, when he was
suppposed to be on dilantin alone. This was explained to him and
his wife, and apology offered and accepted. No evident harm
resulted, and the Keppra was discontinued and the medication
list corrected and all providers involved notified of the error
that was collectively made.
.
## Code status: FULL CODE as confirmed with patient during this
admission.
