weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
53 M with CAD, ischemic CM with depressed systolic EF (20%),
diabetes and h/o PE on anticoagulation who presented to ED with
LE weakness and feeling unwell where he was found to be in ARF
complicated by hyperkalemia.  States that he started to feel
unwell a few days ago.  Has been suffering with frequent loose
bowel movements a day during the past 4 days; no associated N/V,
change in appetite, abd pain or fevers. No melena or BPR. No
sick contacts or recent travel.  No change in dietary habits.
No Abx exposure since [**2120-8-25**].  Today he felt particulary
week and clumsy.  Because of which he was unable to arise from
his W/C and fell.  Pt recently seen in heart failure clinic and
was placed on a larger dose of lisinopril.  He denies any chest
pain, for which he never suffers from.  He has no SOB or marked
orthopnea.  He LE edema is much improved since his admission in
[**Month (only) **].  He does not know his current and/or dry weight. Pt reports
good UOP without change in quality or quantity. No recent
illnesses or sore throat. Changes in medications include
increased ACEi dose.  Pt with leg pain consistent with his
neruopathy but difficult to separate from Sx's secondary to
claudication.  Pt transferred to ICU for management of ARF and
hyperkalemia.  Upon arrival to the ICU he feels fatigued with
back and leg discomfort after his long stay in the ED.

ED Course: Afeb, 107/97, 79 32 98% RA.  Given Insulin/D50,
CaGluc, Kayexelate, lasix, 3 amps NaHCO3, attempt at dialysis
catheter unsuccessful.

Brief Hospital Course:
53yo male with CAD, DM, CHF, and chronic renal insufficiency
transferred from the MICU after being initially admitted for
acute renal failure with hyperkalemia both of which are now
improved.
.
PLAN:
1. Acute Renal Failure:
Patient was initially admitted with hyperkalemia secondary to
acute renal failure with creatinine elevated to 2.8 from
baseline of [**11-25**].2 thought most likely secondary to increased
ACEI dose in the setting of hypovolemia from diarrhea and
continued diuretics.  Creatinine has improved to 1.9 from 2.8 on
admission with roughly 700cc positive for LOS.  Pt. did not
receive dialysis during stay. Continued lisinopril at 1/2 dose
for now.  Holding lasix and spironolactone.  Patient will
follow-up with PCP within the next 1-2 days after [**Date Range **] to
decide whether to restart lasix and spironolactone.  Renally
dosed medications.  Continued telemetry.  Renal followed patient
during hospitalization.  Followed Creatinine and urine output.
.
2. CHF:
Patient with known ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20% and
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] in cardiology.  Continue to hold lasix
(home dose is lasix 160mg PO daily) until renal function and BP
stabilize, will need to be restarted as outpatient.  Continue
low-dose ACEI with lisinopril at 5mg (1/2 dose), beta blocker
with low-dose carvedilol 3.125mg PO daily.  Continued daily
weights and low sodium diet.  Patient has outpatient follow-up
for consideration of ICD placement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2120-11-29**].

.
3. Tachypnea:   Upon admission, patient with tachypnea, though
most likely a compensatory response [**12-27**] metabolic acidosis from
renal failure. Now improved with improving renal function.
.
4. Asymptomatic Hyponatremia:  Na 118 upon admission thought
most likely secondary to ARF and volume depletion and diuretics
use.  Has been improving steadily since admission with Na 135 on
day of [**Month/Day (2) **].
.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: No evidence of active ischemia.
Continued beta-blocker, high dose statin, ASA.  Gave 1/2 dose
ACEI given ARF.
.
6. Diabetes Mellitus:  Continued patient's home insulin regimen
of lantus 72 units at bedtime with insulin sliding scale.
Monitored finger sticks.
.
7. Depression: continued home dose of prozac.
.
# FEN:  Diabetic, heart-healthy, low Na, renal diet.  Continued
MVI, iron daily, folate 1mg daily.
.
# Proph: Continued H2 blocker, anticoagulated on coumadin.
Maintained contact precautions.  [**Name2 (NI) **] bowel regimen given recent
diarrhea.
.
