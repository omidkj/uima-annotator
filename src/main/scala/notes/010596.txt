Date of Birth:  [**2030-1-26**]             Sex:   M

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
Lung mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Bronchoscopy.
2. Reoperative right thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy
    and en bloc right chest wall resection (ribs 3,4 and 5)
    with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex chest wall reconstruction and
    decortication of right middle and right lower lobes


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75713**] was initially evaluated for resectability of a
locally-advanced
right lung cancer.  The patient has a 60-pack-year smoking
history and has a complex history  for a right-sided lung mass
beginning back in 04/[**2100**].  At that time, he appeared to have a
right chest abnormality which on fiberoptic bronchoscopy was
cytologically positive for malignancy.  He
underwent cervical and anterior mediastinoscopy that did not
show
any involvement of the mediastinal lymph nodes followed by a
thoracoscopy and subsequent exploratory thoracotomy which
defined
a chest wall invasive lesion felt to be T3 if not, T4 because I
presume a diffuse pleural involvement.  He was deemed
unresectable and then begun on chemotherapy, which has consisted
of a weekly carboplatin and Taxol with Avastin under the care of
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the Cancer Center of [**Location (un) 86**].  He now presents
for resection of localy advanced tumor.

Past Medical History:
Significant for a traumatic blindness in
the left eye, hypertension, appendectomy, and alcohol-induced
gastric ulcers.  He has been alcohol-free for almost two
decades.


Social History:
Quit smoking 18 years ago. No alcohol x 20 years.

Family History:
Notable for cerebral hemorrhage.  His father had
lung cancer.  He had a brother with gastric cancer and another
brother with emphysema and a sister with cystic fibrosis.


Physical Exam:
HEENT:  Ocular deformity on the left where he is blind .
Anicteric sclerae.
NECK:  He has no adenopathy in the neck region or
supraclavicular
fossa.
LUNGS: Decreased/coarse breathsounds right lung with soft
crackles. Incisions clean, dry, intact. Some resolving
ecchymoses. No hematoma.
HEART:  Regular rhythm and rate.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with normal bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  He has trace peripheral edema.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: white out of R lung - bronch clean, assess for effusions


[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
white out of R lung - bronch clean, assess for effusions
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 70-year-old male with right lung cancer status post
right upper lobectomy and bronchoscopy. Evaluate for effusions.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the chest are obtained
without the administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Multiplanar reformation images are reconstructed.

COMPARISON: Chest CT dated [**2100-12-1**], and multiple prior
chest radiographs dating between [**2100-12-13**] to [**2100-12-27**].

FINDINGS: The patient is status post right thoracotomy with
right upper lobectomy for lung cancer with surgical sutures.
Again note is made of large right pneumothorax occupying
approximately half of the right hemithorax, with two chest tubes
and hydropneumothorax at the base. The anterior chest tube
terminates in the apex in the pneumothorax cavity, and posterior
chest tube crosses posterior aspect of the pleura and terminates
at the apex. There is a large pneumomediastinum surrounding
trachea and esophagus, which extends somewhat to the left apex.
The mediastinal structure is shifted to the right as noted on
the plain radiograph. There is a large subcutaneous emphysema
cavity extending from most of the visualized portion of the
right chest and shoulder, overall unchanged since [**12-27**]
comparing the scout image versus portable radiograph, however,
is markedly increased since 23rd. Just above the anterior chest
tube exit from the thoracic cavity, the pneumothorax cavity and
the subcutaneous emphysema cavity appears to be communicated.
There is evidence of prior right thoracotomy in the right upper
ribs, with chest wall reconstruction with thin mesh.

The evaluation of mediastinal structures and great vessels is
limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Atherosclerotic disease of the aorta is again noted. There is no
significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy noted on this
limited evaluation. The aerated portion of the right lung has
patchy opacities especially at the bases with effusion, likely
representing atelectasis and edema. There are postoperative
changes as well, with opacity surrounding the surgical suture.

In the left lung, there is dependent atelectasis and small
effusion. There are patchy faint centrilobular opacities in the
left lower lobe likely representing aspiration.

There are degenerative changes of thoracol
