ECG [**2120-4-10**]:
Atrial fibrillation. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior
fascicular
block. Anterior myocardial infarction of undetermined age.
Cannot exclude
ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous
tracing
of [**2120-4-2**] precordial lead ST-T wave changes appear slightly more
prominent
but may be no significant change.

Portable CXR [**2120-4-10**]:
IMPRESSION: Overall stable radiograph with small bilateral
pleural effusions and presumed atelectasis at the lung bases.
The opacity at the right lung base, however, is slightly more
confluent and an underlying infiltrate cannot be entirely
excluded.

TTE [**2120-4-11**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal anterior
wall and septum. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2119-7-12**], pulmonary artery pressures can be seen
to be mildly elevated on the current study. The other findings
are similar.

Video Swallow [**2120-4-12**]:
FINDINGS:
Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus
without evidence of obstruction. There is no gross aspiration.
Several episodes of penetration were noted during administration
of thin consistency barium. For details, please refer to speech
and swallow division note in OMR.

IMPRESSION:
No evidence of aspiration. Several episodes of penetration with
thin liquids.

CT chest w/o contrast [**2120-4-16**]:
FINDINGS: Bilateral new nonhemorrhagic moderately large pleural
effusions
have developed
