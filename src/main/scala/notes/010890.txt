Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**]
Chief Complaint:
False Aneurysm of the aorta

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracoabdominal Aortic aneursym repair

History of Present Illness:
This 78-year-old presented with history of a prior abdominal
aortic aneurysm and a popliteal aneurysm.  He developed a false
aneurysm but then his autograft had suddenly increased in size
by 5 cm.  The situation was complicated by the fact that his
ejection fraction was only 20%.  His right kidney was
nonfunctional and his creatinine was 2.5.  At this point,
repair was felt to be a dangerous procedure for him and thus he
might well end up on
dialysis.  He felt that he would like to take a chance at
surgery, as this was likely to rupture at any time.
