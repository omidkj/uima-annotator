History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32713**] is a 80 year-old Spanish speaking female with HTN,
DM, autoimmune cirrhosis c/b variceal bleeding, s/p CCY with a
recent admission [**Date range (1) **] for colitis who presents now with
multiple episodes of BRBPR. Her initial illness began
approximately one week ago with N/V, watery diarrhea (no blood
at that time), bloating, and abdominal pain exacerbated after
eating. No blood initially in stool or emesis. CT scan showed
new findings consistent with an infectious colitis. She was
treated with cipro/flagyl for presumed infectious colitis (stool
studies were not sent) and improved. Since being home, she has
had no further N/V. Diarrhea initially improved but then
worsened again over last 24 hours, with multiple loose/watery
BM. Stool had been yellowish-brown. Abdominal pain has
definitely improved from last admission but still has some
diffuse tenderness and a feeling like bloating/gas. She had
low-grade fevers with her original illness and today felt cold
again so questions whether she may have been febrile (although
daughter says heat was accidently turned off in her apartment,
so that may have been responsible). She also reports feeling
some LH for the last 1-2 days which is a change from prior.
.
Today, she had an episode of diarrhea where she noticed BRB in
the toilet. Difficult for her to determine whether it was mixed
in with the stool or separate. She has had milder rectal
bleeding in the past (known hemorrhoids) but none recently.
After this episode, her granddaughter brought her into the [**Name (NI) **].
While here, she had a few more episodes of rectal bleeding, the
first of which seemed to be promted by rectal exam per ED
resident, who estimate ~50cc of dark red blood mixed with stool.
Did not appear melenotic per report.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.7 64 178/74 20 100% 3L NC.
Hepatology team was consulted and recommended admission to ET
service. Her admission vitals were 98.6 56 180/55 16 100%.
.
On the floor, patient appears well. She is with her
granddaughter who helps to translate (speaks very limited
English). She endorses some continued abdominal pain and a
little headache, but otherwise feeling OK right now.
.
Review of systems: Per HPI. Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea
or congestion aside from usual allergies. Denied cough,
shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 32713**] is a 80 year old female with autoimmune
hepatitis/cirrhosis with recent admission for possible
infectious colitis who presented with bilateral lower abdominal
pain and hematochezia.

Hematochezia: Likely ischemic colitis versus rectal variceal
bleed.  Infectious workup was negative.  NG lavage was negative
for upper GI source of bleeding.  She was transferred to the
MICU (night of [**2170-1-6**])  due to a brief episode of hypotension
(SBP 160-190 dropped to 110s) in the setting of a large bloody
bowel movement.  She rapidly became hemodynamically stable with
transfusion (received total 4 units PRBC) and was transferred
back to the floor [**2170-1-7**].  She received a flexible
sigmoidoscopy [**2170-1-9**], however the source of bleeding was not
identified.  She had been admitted on cipro/flagyl from prior
admission.  She was continued on these antibiotics to complete
her original 7 day course.  Ciprofloxacin alone was extended for
another 7 days from onset of her hematochezia for SBP
prophylaxis.

Hypertension: Blood pressure was difficult to control (SBP
160-190).  She did not have hypertensive urgency.  She was
restarted on her home medications once hemodynamic stability was
ensured and hematocrit was stable.  She will follow up with her
PCP for dosage adjustments as needed.
.
Cirrhosis/autoimmune hepatitis: Continued on home ursodiol.  She
is not on chronic immunosuppression.
.
Diabetes: She had intermittently low glucose likely secondary to
poor PO intaker.  Her lantus dose was decreased to 12 units
during admission.  Her diet was advanced and she was sent home
on her home dose of Lantus 48 units nightly.
.
She was full code for this admission.
