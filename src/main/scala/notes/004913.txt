Service:  Neonatology


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 449**] [**Known lastname 9434**] is twin Number 1,
a 29 [**1-9**] week gestation male infant, weight 1290 gm.
Transferring hospital [**Hospital3 **], delivering obstetrician
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 38418**], MD, primary pediatrician unknown.

Mother is a 28 year old gravida 1, para 0, now 1 mother.
Prenatal screens, blood type 0 negative, antibody negative,
Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative and gonorrhea culture negative.  This was a spontaneous
twin pregnancy that was uncomplicated until Mom was noted to
develop some cervical shortening.  She was treated with
betamethasone no [**10-1**] and 30.  These are
diamniotic/dichorionic twins.  She presented to [**Hospital6 **] on the night prior to delivery with preterm labor
and was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**].
She had spontaneous rupture of membranes three hours prior to
delivery.  Delivery was by cesarean section because of breech
presentation.  The infant emerged with good tone and vigorous
dry.  She received bulb suctioning and blow by oxygen.  He
developed mild grunting at about 10 minutes of age.  The
infant was intubated in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit
because of increased work of breathing and poor air entry.
Chest x-ray showed bilaterally hazy lung fields, normal heart
size and also showed endotracheal tube in good position.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed weight 1290 gm, 60th percentile, length 40.5 cm,
75th percentile, head circumference 28 cm, 60th percentile.
This is a pink, vigorous active male average for gestational
age preterm infant.  The anterior fontanelle was soft and
flat, sutures mobile.  Normal red reflex, both eyes, lips,
gums and palates intact.  Mild intercostal retractions, good
air entry after intubation, equal breath sounds.  Heart,
normal S1 and S2, no murmur noted.  Pulses normal, perfusion
good.  Abdomen soft, no organomegaly, three vessel cord.
Genitourinary, right testicle palpable, left testis high in
canal.  Neurologic, good tone, symmetrical examination.
Hips, slightly increased laxity but stable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory system - Shortly after
admission to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit, [**Known lastname 449**] was
intubated.  He received a total of two doses of Surfactant
and was weaned to continuous positive airway pressure by day
of life Number 1.  He quickly weaned to room air by day of
life Number 2.  He has remained in room air for the remainder
of his hospitalization, maintaining his saturations from 92
to 98 percent.  Caffeine citrate was started on day of life
Number 2 for episodes of apnea of prematurity.  He continues
on caffeine citrate at this time.

Cardiovascular system - Shortly after admission to the
Newborn Intensive Care Unit a loud murmur was auscultated.
An echocardiogram on [**10-18**] and [**10-25**], showed a
large membranous ventriculoseptal defect and a patent foramen
ovale.  The infant has been evaluated by Cardiology at
[**Hospital3 1810**] on [**10-27**], due to increased work of
breathing and suspicion of failure related to the large
ventriculoseptal defect, regular Lasix was initiated.  He has
also been started on Aldactone as well.  Increased work of
breathing on day of life Number 19 with increased respiratory
rate and increased retractions prompted an increase in the
Lasix dosage.  He is being transferred to P6 at [**Hospital3 18242**] for management of his heart disease and likely
repair of membranous ventriculoseptal defect on Tuesday,
[**11-9**].

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Upon admission to the
Newborn Intensive Care Unit he was started on intravenous
fluids of D10/W at 80 cc/kg/day.  [**Known lastname 449**] was started on
enteral feeds on day of life Number 5 at 20 cc/kg/day.  These
were successfully advanced up to a full volume of 150
cc/kg/day by day of life Number 10.  Caloric density has been
gradually increased up to 32 calorie breast milk.  His weight
at the time of discharge is 1420 gm.  Electrolytes on
[**11-6**], sodium 136, potassium 4.3, chloride 96, total
carbon dioxide was 28.

Gastrointestinal system - [**Known lastname 449**] was started under single
phototherapy on day of life Number 2 for a bilirubin of 7.5
with a direct bilirubin of 0.3.  Phototherapy was
discontinued on day of life Number 5 for a bilirubin of 3.4
with a rebound bilirubin of 4.5 on day of life Number 6.

Hematology system - [**Known lastname 449**]' hematocrit upon admission to the
Newborn Intensive Care Unit was 45.7.  He has received three
transfusions during his hospitalization, his first
transfusion on day of life Number 19, second transfusion on
day of life Number 21 and the third transfusion on the 22nd
day of life.  His hematocrit at the time of transfer is 43.9.

Infectious disease - Upon admission to the Newborn Intensive
Care Unit a complete blood count with differential and blood
cultures were drawn.  The complete blood count showed a white
count of 6.5, hematocrit 45.7, platelet count of 217 with 38
percent polys and 1 percent band.  Blood culture at that time
was negative.  He received a 48 hour course of ampicillin and
gentamicin.  On day of life Number 19, or [**11-3**], the
infant was noted to have a high fever to 102.6 prompting a
sepsis evaluation.  A complete blood count at that time
showed a white blood cell count of 21.8, a hematocrit of
35.3, platelet count of 522 with 60 percent polys and 0
percent bands.  A blood culture drawn at that time was
negative.  Lumbar puncture was also performed.  Lumbar
puncture culture was negative and cell count unremarkable.
At that time cerebrospinal fluid PCR was sent.  The infant at
this time was started on vancomycin, gentamicin and
acyclovir.  He continues on those antibiotics at this time.
