Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]
Chief Complaint:
? seizure, delta MS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture [**7-11**] and [**7-3**]


History of Present Illness:
47 year old female with Hep C cirrhosis, HIV ([**5-27**] CD4 >1000,
VL>916,000), Type II DM, and recently diagnosed chronic renal
failure presents following possible seizure. Her boyfriend
reports that earlier today, he noted that, when she was giving
herself insulin her right hand began shaking for a few minutes.
She was also complaining of a mild frontal headache, relieved
with ibuprofen. Boyfriend left the pt at 6am this morning. Both
pt's mother and boyfriend attempted to call the pt at 10am then
at 11am, but pt did not respond to the phone. After returning
from work at 3:45 p.m., her boyfriend found her unconscious and
covered in stool/urine; she later opened her eyes, but did not
seem to recognize him. No known fevers, chills, URI symptoms,
abdominal or urinary symptoms. She was brought to the ED, where
T 99.8, HR 112, bp 178/101, resp 20 96% 2L NC. She was noted to
have eye deviation to the left with nystagmus, followed by
deviation to the right with nystagmus. She received Ativan 4 mg
IV X 1 with resolution of eye deviation. Given shallow breathing
and diminished gag, she was intubated for airway protection.
.
The patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 44757**] after she presented
with decreased UOP, increased LE edema, and increased abdominal
girth and was found to be in subacute renal failure (BUN
64/5.1). Exam/laboratory studies were c/w nephrotic syndrome,
and a renal U/S showed lg echogenic kidneys with nl perfusion.
Initially, her symptoms were fel to be c/w HIV-associated
nephropathy. Renal bx [**6-27**] was c/w diabetic nephropathy +/- IgA
nephropathy. She was aggressively diuresed with good response;
her Cr declined to 4.2 at time of discharge.

[**2114-7-2**] EKG
Sinus tachycardia, rate 109. Probable left atrial abnormality.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2114-6-20**] sinus tachycardia
and left atrial abnormality are new.

[**2114-7-2**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

[**2114-7-2**] SPINAL FLUID
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Lymphocytes and monocytes.

[**2114-7-3**] MRI/MRA HEAD
1. Multiple lesions with high T2 signal in the periventricular
and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres
bilaterally, which appear nonspecific but may represent
infection, chronic microvascular ischemia, or demyelinating
disease.
2. Flow in all major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] on
otherwise limited MRA.

CXR [**2114-7-9**]
Improved consolidation with residual consolidation in the
posterior basilar segment of the right lower lobe.

[**2114-7-9**] CT HEAD
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift
of normally midline structures. The ventricles are stable in
size. There are new small bilateral low density fluid
collections over the frontal convexities.

[**2114-7-9**] ABD ULTRASOUND
1. No findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis on ultrasound.
2. Questionable subcentimeter area of focal thickening in
relation to the anterior gallbladder wall, which could be
followed up at interval with focused ultrasound.
3. No intra-abdominal ascites for paracentesis.

CSF [**2114-7-11**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Lymphocytes, monocytes, and red
blood cells.

EEG [**2114-7-10**]
This is an abnormal routine EEG obtained in stage II sleep
progressing to stage III sleep with brief periods of wakefulness
due to
the presence of sharp and spikes bifrontally, left more than
right. In
addition, the patient is excessively drowsy and sleepy. This
finding
could either be due to a previous sleep deprivation or could be
a
medication overdose effect. This can be seen in context of high
blood
levels of antihistamines, Albuterol. No seizure activity
recorded.


Brief Hospital Course:
47 y/o AAF with PMH significant for HIV, Hepatitis C, cirrhosis,
Type II DM, HTN, and most recent hospitalization for subacute
renal failure (DM nephropathy +/- IgA Nephropathy), presents
with altered mental status.
1. Mental status changes
While her initial mental status changes were thought to be due
to hypoglycemia (glucose on admission was 36), the differential
regarding this remains broad.  Acyclovir and levofloxacin, as
well as sedatives she was given in the ICU may have contributed
to her MS given her poor renal and hepatic clearance (propofol,
d/c on [**7-4**]; morphine, dosed 2mg on [**7-6**], and ?amt on [**7-4**]).
She was also found to have aspiration pneumonia, which also may
have aggrevated her mental status.  Initially, following
transfer from the ICU, her mental status improved and was
thought to be secondary to medications over her stay .  Hepatic
encephalopathy is still a possibility, with her elevated ammonia
(84 umol/L), but was not encephalopathic during previous
hospital stay and did not receive lactulose at that time; she
received lactulose throughout this admission.  Similarly, uremic
encephalopathy was also considered although her BUN today was
70, and at prior admission, she was not encephalopathic though
in ARF with elevated BUN/Cr.  Delirium tremens was also
considered, however her history and speaking with her family
speaks against this.  Her family states that she did not drink
from the time she was discharged to her admission.  The time
frame was off given her stay in the MICU for delerium tremens,
and her symptoms were not consistent with this.  In addition, a
ppd was planted and read as negative on [**7-9**].  Finally, an
HTLV1/2 was found to be negative, suggesting her high CD4 count
of >1000 did represent true immunocompentency, as HTLV1/2
infection can give a false impression of a high
