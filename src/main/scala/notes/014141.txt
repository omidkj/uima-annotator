Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13787**]
Chief Complaint:
problems walking

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVIG

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 82 yo RHF with h/o HTN and COPD who presents with ~2
weeks of left back pain and 3 days of gait imbalance and
difficulty walking up and down stairs.
  She was in her USOH until early [**Month (only) 404**] when she was admitted
to OSH for several days for PNA.  She went home on prednisone
taper, combivent, and brief O2. She recovered well and was doing
fine, but started to develop left sided thoracic region back
pain.  This is described as deep and worsened by movement and
activity.  She has had pleurisy in the past and says this feels
somewhat similar but not exactly like her old feeling.  She also
had zoster on that side, but higher up ~1.5 years ago.  The pain
she has now is not similar to her zoster pain.  She saw her PCP
for this about a week ago and was given Aleve and Darvon.  She
has taken a few doses of this, but usually only one pill a day.
  Then, along with her back pain ? worsening, she developed what
sounds like a fairly acute inability to walk in a straight line
or to go up or down stairs without support.  She says her legs
feel "like lead" and that she feels off balance. She cannot tell
me which is the [**Last Name 17299**] problem.  She doesn't remember a definite
acute event after which she was having problems, but thinks
since
[**Name (NI) 766**] she has had these problems.  They have possibly been
worsening over the last 3 days.  She reports that she has to put
her feet far apart when walking in order to not fall down.
Before this, she walked very normally without assistance.  She
stumbles when walking, but not preferentially to one side or the
other.  She does feel the ground under her feet.  No sensory
changes.
  She had a head CT at OSH which was normal, UA normal, CBC
normal, and lytes with hyponatremia. LFTs normal.

ROS: Patient denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
headache, neck pain, numbness, tingling, dizziness, dysarthria,
dysphagia, wt loss, visual changes, hearing changes, chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or bowel/bladder problems.

CXR [**1-28**]:
FINDINGS: The heart size and mediastinal contours appear within
normal limits. Since the previous examination, the endotracheal
tube and nasogastric tube have been removed. There is new
reticular opacity at the right apex and right base without focal
consolidation. Linear opacity is seen at the left base
consistent with mild linear atelectasis. The osseous structures
appear unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. New reticular opacities within the right lung, suggestive of
an interstitial process. The differential diagnosis includes
atypical infection or inflammatory process versus aspiration and
continued followup with chest radiography is recommended.
2. Minimal left lower lobe atelectasis.

Repeat CXR [**1-30**]:
FINDINGS: There is borderline heart size but no typical
configurational abnormalities present. The thoracic aorta is
moderately widened and slightly elongated and calcium deposits
are seen in the wall. No local aortic contour abnormalities are
identified.

No pulmonary vascular congestion is present. The general
appearance of the lung fields with irregular vascular
distribution and relatively low positioned diaphragms is
suggestive of COPD. Comparison is made with the next previous
chest examination of [**2193-1-28**] and at that time
particular opacities in the right lung suggestive of an
interstitial process have clearly improved. Only in the lower
portion of the right upper lobe close to the minor fissure are
there some increased reticular pattern noticeable. No new
abnormalities have developed.

IMPRESSION: General appearance consistent with COPD.
Interstitial process in right lung clearly regressed. No
evidence of CHF. Additional followup to establish complete
normalization of the interstitial reticular markings in the
right upper lobe is suggested.

EMG:
CLINICAL HISTORY:
82-year-old woman with six-day history of gait imbalance and
weakness. She has also noted lower back pain during the same
time. She had laryngitis one month prior to development of the
weakness. Her weakness has continued to progress, and now she
has weakness of her arms, legs, voice, swallowing, and
breathing.

Directed neurological examination shows symmetric, moderate
weakness
throughout, including bulbar muscles and neck flexors and
extensors. There is no clear proximal-distal gradient. She has
no reflexes. There is no clear deficit for pinprick but reduced
vibratory perception at the ankles.

This study was requested to evaluate for [**Year (4 digits) 7816**]-[**Location (un) **]
syndrome.

FINDINGS:
Motor nerve conduction studies (NCSs) of the left deep peroneal
nerve showed markedly prolonged distal latency with mildly
reduced response amplitudes and normal conduction velocities.
There is temporal dispersion of the response with proximal
stimulation. Left peroneal F responses were absent.

Motor NCSs of the left tibial nerve showed moderately prolonged
distal
latencies with normal response amplitude and mildly reduced
conduction
velocity. Motor NCSx of the right tibial nerve showed markedly
prolonged
distal latency with normal response am
