Penicillins / Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4028**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
69F h/o COPD (FEV1 47%), tobacco abuse, DM2, chronic back pain
on narcotics, mild dementia initially presented with
hypoglycemia after insulin overdose at home. The patient was
discharged [**2161-1-15**] after COPD exacerbation and UTI on prednisone
taper, azithromycin, and keflex.
.
Apparently, the daughter went to administer lantus at 1630 and
gave 40 units instead of 4. No symptoms at the time except poor
appetite with difficulty eating and could not find blood glucose
meter or test strips to monitor. Brought patient to ED for
evaluation at urging of PCP.
.
In the ED, FSBS 116 on arrival and ate dinner, with
post-prandial FSBG 58. Tox was consulted. Given D5 1/2 NS at
125/hr and observed overnight. In the AM, the D5 gtt stopped and
ate breakfast, but became tremulous with FSBG 51 and given amp
D50. Subsequently developed SOB and hypoxia with new O2
requirement (RR 30, SaO2 91% RA -> 94% 4L). Vitals otherwise
stable in ED and afebrile. Combivent neb given.
.
CXR without acute process and ECG with unchanged LBBB. Labs
notable for elevated BNP and d-dimer, negative cardiac enzymes
and normal WBC. U/A grossly positive and given Cipro. CTA chest
negative for PE and without infiltrate. Started on BiPAP 5/5 and
given lasix 20 IV and nitropaste 1" for ?CHF although no prior
history, also ASA 325 and atenolol 125. Admit to ICU.
.
ROS: Complains for back pain and SOB. Denies chest pain, nausea,
diaphroesis, headache, parasthesias, focal weakness, or other
general symptoms.

[**1-17**] Blood culture -pending on discharge
[**1-17**] Urine culture >100 000 E coli

[**1-17**] CXR
Again seen is hyperinflation and peripheral attenuation of
vessels, consistent
with COPD. The patient is status post sternotomy. There is
mild-to-moderate
cardiomegaly, with mild unfolding and tortuosity of the aorta.
Prominence of
the pulmonary arteries with a tapered configuration is
consistent with
pulmonary hypertension. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is
identified.
No pneumothorax is detected.

[**1-17**] CTA chest
IMPRESSION:

1. No pulmonary embolism or dissection.

2. New slight compression deformity of mid-thoracic (probably
T6) superior
endplate.

3. Unchanged pulmonary nodules.

4. Small right and trace left pleural effusions.

5. Unchanged left ventricular hypertrophy, changes from prior
aortic valve
replacement, and atherosclerotic calcification.

[**1-18**] CXR
Compared with [**2161-1-17**] at 9:10 a.m., no significant change is
detected.

Again seen is severe hyperinflation, consistent with severe
COPD. The patient
is status post sternotomy with moderate cardiomegaly and
unfolded aorta,
unchanged. No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.
No
pneumothorax is detected.

[**1-19**] ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
25-30%). Systolic function of apical segments is relatively
preserved (suggestive of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The estimated cardiac
index is depressed (2.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
global hypokinesis suggestive of a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
In the absence of a history of systemic hypertension, an
infiltrative process should be considered (e.g., amyloid,
Fabry's, etc.).

Brief Hospital Course:
69F h/o COPD (FEV1 47%), tobacco abuse, DM2, chronic back pain
on narcotics, mild dementia initially presented with
hypoglycemia after accidental insulin overdose and developed
acute SOB while being observed in the ED.
.
1.  Dyspnea:  Most likely secondary to volume overload in the
setting of volume resuscitation from hypoglycemia vs. COPD
exacerbation. No previous history of CHF, but elevated BNP.  CTA
negative for PE.  Improved after receiving lasix in the ED.
Solumedrol 125 IV x1 given in the ED.   CXR appeared clear
except for chronic emphysematous changes.  Weaned off BiPAP on
arrival to the MICU.   Patient was started on a long prednisone
taper, given recent admit for COPD exacerbation, and sudden
worsening dyspnea. Patient was also gi
