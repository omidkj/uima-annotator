History of Present Illness:
This 62 year old male with a history of COPD presented to [**Hospital **] with acute shortness of breath. He was unwell one
week prior to admission, with shortness of breath making it
difficult to sleep. He also had experienced some chest tightness
and notes non-painful mass in the side of his neck. At admission
he denied fever, vomiting or diarrhea. He had wheezes on exam
and was given bronchodilators with some improvement. He was
hypertensive at the time of arrival 180/100. His WBC was
elevated to 15.5, ABG 7.28/73/63.
At [**Hospital6 **] a CXR showed right upper lobe mass. A CT
was performed which showed a spiculated mass in the right upper
lobe with contiguous and marked mediastinal adenopathy,
compression and distortion of the superior vena cava, extending
up into the superior mediastinum in the supraclavicular area and
compression of the right brachiocephalic vein, narrowing of the
trachea. The patient had elevated CE at the OSH, he was started
on Heparin despite the most likely diagnosis being demand
ischemia in the setting of hypoxia.
He was on BiPap at the OSH for his decreased saturation. He was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchoscopy to obtain tissue for
diagnosis. He currently feels well except for some shortness of
breath. He also notes that his face feels warm and eyes are
iritated.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was diagnosed with likely NSCLC (definitive pathology had not
returned).  A CT showed tracheal compression and compression of
[**Last Name (LF) 17911**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he underwent a tracheal stent and inominate stenting.
He was trasiently intubated for hypoxia but improved.
On [**9-23**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for radiation
therapy.  However, following his first treatments of chemo and
radiotherpay the patient requested to have his code status
changed to DNR/DNI on [**2160-9-28**].  He refused telemetry.  He was
found later that night after having expired.  The [**Hospital 228**]
health care proxy, his sister [**Name (NI) **], refused a postmortem.  The
[**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, his sister [**Name (NI) **], was notified of
the patient's demise.

1.  Respiratory status:
He has respiratory distress due to both the lung cancer and
COPD.  He has been retaining CO2 and on transfer his PCO2 was
76.  He also was desatting into the mid 80s at night and
positive pressure ventiulation was attempted using both face
mask and nasal positive pressure, however the patient was
extremely uncomfortable and didn't tolerate the positive
pressure.  Therefore, at night he had been on face mask with
FiO2 titrated to keep his oxygen saturation at 90 or above.
During the day he had been satting in the mid 90s on nasal
cannula oxygen.  On [**2160-9-28**], he became acutely hypoxic from a
presumed PE and expired.

2.  Lung CA:
The pathology suggests stage IIIb non small cell lung cancer.
Tissue was obtained from both bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy.
A head CT was negative for metastases, as was a bone scan for
osseous metastases.  He will be treated with a 5 week course of
radiotherapy four times per week along with weekly
radiosensitizing chemotherapy of carbaplatin and paclitaxel.  He
received his first dose of radiation therpay on [**9-24**] and his
first dose of chemotherpay on [**9-25**].  He was quite nauseous
after the first dose of chemo requiring antiemetics.  He was
also put on atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  There were no
immediate side effects of the radiation therapy.

3.  Vena Cava Syndrome: Shortly after arrival to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU,
the patient had a stent placed in his right inominate artery.
His facial swelling decreased after the stent, thoguh he
continued to have facial flushing.  A follow up CT venogram
showed persistent narrowing the the [**Hospital Ward Name 17911**].  The patient was also
anticoagulated with heparin with a goal PTT of 60-80 for the
vascular stent, however this was discontinued on [**2160-9-26**] after
the patient developed a retroperitoneal bleed.

4.  Fever: During his hospital course, the patient began spiking
fevers to 101 and developed a new infiltrate in his right upper
lung field concerning for pneumonia.
penumonia.  He was started on a 10 day course of zosyn.  It is
possiblke that the poneumonia was postobstructive from the lung
cancer or alternatively from aspiration following the tracheal
stent placement.

5.  Retroperitoneal bleed: Shortly after beginning
anticoagulation therapy, a retroperitoneal bleed was noted on
the patient's follow up CT scan.  His hct dropped 10 points, and
his heparin was discontinued.

6.  The patient's code was changed to DNR/DNI on [**9-28**].  He was
very clear that he wanted this change in code status.
