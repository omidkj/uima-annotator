History of Present Illness:
64M s/p minimally invasive esophagectomy for stabe III CA [**98**]
days prior to admission, now with respiratory distress.  Per
report patient sent from rehab with signs of labored breathing,
tachypnea, decreased 02 sats and episodes of bilious emesis.
Was in ED preparing for urgent intubation.  No report of fevers
or chills.

Past Medical History:
1. Esophageal Cancer
Patient was initially diagnosed in [**2197-1-4**] at which time he
developed problems swallowing with solid food getting stuck in
his mid-chest. EGD on [**2197-1-4**] demonstrated a 3cm malignant,
nodular mass at the GE junction with biopsy consistent with
adenocarcinoma, extending beneath squamous epithelium.
Endoscopic ultrasound was performed on [**2197-1-16**] with staging
consistent with T3N1.  He is being treated with 5FU and
radiation.  He had his first dose of 5-FU on [**2197-2-25**] which he
tolerated well.  Given his renal insufficiency he is not a
candidate for cisplatin therapy, however his primary oncologist
is considering adding a second [**Doctor Last Name 360**] depending on how he
responds to 5-FU

EKG [**5-29**] - Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific inferolateral ST-T
wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-5-22**] atrial
flutter is absent. Sinus tachycardia is present. ST-T wave
changes are slightly more pronounced.

CXR [**5-29**] - IMPRESSION: Post-surgical appearance with findings in
the lower right hemithorax raising the possibility of herniated
bowel loops and/or other intra-abdominal contents. There is no
definite consolidation.

CT torso [**5-30**]  RUL and RLL consolidations, and airspace opacity
consistent with pneumonia, possibly related to aspiration. Some
adjacent atelectasis. Gastric conduit intact. ETT and NGT in
appropriate position. Minimal inflammatory change in upper
abomen likely represent postsurgical change.
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. persistent left SVC. J-tube in good
position. no acute intraabdominal process.

[**6-2**] CXR FINDINGS: There is slight worsening to a right lower
lobe consolidation.  Consolidation within the right upper lobe
remains stable. Right subclavian central venous catheter is
unchanged with tip in the mid SVC. There is a small left pleural
effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No
pneumothorax.

[**6-5**] Video Swallow:
FINDINGS: There is slight worsening to a right lower lobe
consolidation.
Consolidation within the right upper lobe remains stable. Right
subclavian
central venous catheter is unchanged with tip in the mid SVC.
There is a
small left pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. No pneumothorax.

6/16 Esophagus:
IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the esophagus and gastric
conduit shows no evidence of leak or obstruction.

[**6-7**]  CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an improvement.
The
right-sided central access line is in unchanged position, the
right-sided
opacities and the left-sided pleural effusion have almost
completely
disappeared. In the right lung, only a perihilar and a basal
area of
atelectasis subsist.

[**6-9**] Venogram and catheter stripping
IMPRESSION:
1. Unsuccessful attempt of fibrin sheath stripping via
transfemoral approach.
2. Unsuccessful attempt of accessing the Port-A-Cath with a
0.018 Glidewire.
3. SVC venogram demonstrates tip of the catheter adheres to the
vessel wall with presence of tight fibrin sheath.

[**6-13**] ECG
Sinus tachycardia. Non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-5-29**] no diagnostic change.


[**6-13**] CXR (portable AP)
IMPRESSION:
1. Negative examination for new aspiration.
2. Residual atelectasis and/or pneumonia, the sequale of prior
aspiration in the right lower lung region with adjacent small
right pleural effusion.

[**6-13**] chest CT
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal pulmonary opacities, most concentrated in the
right upper lobe, but also involving both lower lobes, likely
representing aspiration or multifocal pneumonia. Mild right
lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Status post esophagectomy with debris in the intrathoracic
stomach.
