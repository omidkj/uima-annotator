Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Alcoholic Ketoacidosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63 year old Male with PMH of COPD and cardiac arrest X4, CVA and
alcoholism transferred from OSH with alcoholic ketoacidosis. Pt
is a poor historian, liklely due to alcoholic dementia. The pt
initially presented to [**Hospital 882**] hospital with a four days
history of emesis. He reported decreased PO intake with
progressive increase in weakness and lightheadedness. Reports a
long alcoholism history of 15-20 drinks/week of 8oz vodka and
water. He reports trying to cut down over the past few days as
he has been motivated by his 20 year old friend who is also
attempting to cut back.

Pt denies previous seizure/withdrawal symtpoms with EtOH
cessation. Denies visual/tactile hallucinations. He reports that
he has multiple medical problems but does not recall them
specifically. He is legally blind and lives at home with his
mother who he states "falls a lot and has a tremor and dementia"
but "worries about me." At [**Hospital1 882**] the patient was given IV
Fluids and thiamine, found to have an ABG of 7.32/11/122/10. Pt
with unknown baseline mental status.

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED vitals T 97.5, HR 100, BP 134/93, RR 18 O2sat 100.
Pt in no acute distress but was uncooperative with exam. Given
1L NS, thiamine and calcium gluconate. On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
the patient is alert and oriented to place. He is in no acute
distress. Pt is tangential in his conversation, wanting to talk
about his anger of the government wanting to make him purchase a
"black box" for his television (of note, this is true as the
switch to digital television is imminent).

Patient was stabilized in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and then transferred to the
[**Hospital Ward Name **] hospitalist service. He was stable, and rapidly
resolved his alcohol withdrawal, however started complaining of
dizziness, particularly post-prandial. On neurologic
consultation, it was noted that post-prandially he was markedly
orthostatic with a 50mm drop in his systolic BP. He was on low
dose beta-blockade so heart rate response was blunted.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2198-7-17**] 9:31 PM
SINGLE VIEW CHEST, PORTABLE UPRIGHT: The cardiomediastinal
contours are
within normal limits with slight unfolding of the aorta. The
lungs are clear. There are no pleural effusions. The pulmonary
vasculature is within normal limits. Mild amount of scarring is
seen at the right lung apex. IMPRESSION: No acute
cardiopulmonary disease.



Brief Hospital Course:
1. Alcholic Ketoacidosis
- Mixed Acid base disturbance - On admission the pt was found to
have a triple disorder of AG metabolic acidosis, respiratory
alkalosis and non-anion gap acidosis.
His anion gap metabolic acidosis was felt most likely caused by
alcoholic ketoacidosis as he had an anion gap of 22 with
positive ketones and acetone.
- He has no history of diabetes and has a normal lactate.
- His osmolar gap was also normal along with a negative alcohol
profile, ruling out toxic alcohol ingestion.
- He was treated with IVF and electrolyte repletion. The pt also
demonstrated a respiratory alkalosis likely secondary to his
underlying hepatic disease.
- Lastly he had an additional Non AG metabolic acidosis most
likely caused by dehydration vs. a  decrease in unmeasured
cations as he had low Mg, P and Ca levels.
- Full recovery in the ICU, and was transferred to the floor

2. Delerium, Alcohol Dependence, Alcohol Withdrawal, Alcoholic
Dementia
- On admission the pt demonstrated a histrionic personality but
also had evidence of auditory and visual hallucinations. He
refused medical care. Given the serious nature of his
electrolyte disturbances psychiatry was consulted to evaluate
the patient's capacity to make medical decisions. The pt was
deemed to lack capacity and required 4pt restraints for IVF and
electrolyte administration.
- He was started on a CIWA scale after developing tachycardia
for concern o
