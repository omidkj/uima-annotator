Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Anemia/Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
86y/o F with h/o AFIB, Lacunar CVA, s/p nephrostomy tube for
nephrolithiasis, and recent ICU admission for sepsis who
presents with weakness for the past few days.  She was brought
to the ED from [**Hospital3 **] because her nephrostomy tube had
fallen out.
.
Per the patient she had been feeling well, until a few days
prior to admission when she felt weak.  She could describe no
antecedent events, or etiology for her sense generalized
fatigue.  She did not report any lightheadedness, dizziness,
palpiations or chest pain.  At times her breath can be
"smothering" but she has not had any recent SOB.  Per the
patient, her bowel and bladder habbits are unchanged, and she
has not noticed any hematuria, dysuria, hematochezia, BRPR,
melena, hematemesis, nausea, or emesis.  She denies any recent
fevers, chills, weakness, parasthesias, or numbness.  Her
coumadin dose was held today, and decreased yesterday.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were T96.9 P116 88%RA with
tachypnea.  At the time she was comfortable, aware, and talking
with headphones and a mircophone.  Her stool was guiac negative,
her abdomen exam was benign, and a CXR demonstrated atelectasis.
 Her HCT dropped from a baseline of 29 to 21, and her K was
elevated at 5.8 in the setting of a elevated Cr of 2.8  Further
imaging of the abdomen demonstrated diverticulosis, a
non-obstructive stone, a pericardial effusion, and no
retroperitoneal bleed.  On transfer, she was ordered two units
of blood and her vitals were: T 98.5, BP 120/65, HR 90s, RR25
Sa: 95%3LNC.

On arrival to the floor she was comfortable, alert, and
oriented.  She had no pain, although she reported feeling weak.
Vital signs: T35.9 P86, BP 61/46 (on Lower Leg), RR21 SA 91
3LNC.  Her Access is PIV and PICC.

Imaging:
.
TTE [**2105-7-3**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is a moderate to large sized
circumferential pericardial effusion (2.5cm inferior and 2.0 cm
lateral to the left ventricle, 1.5cm anterior to the right
atrium and right ventricle) with eccentuated respiratory
variation in transmitral Doppler E wave suggestive of impaired
ventricular filling. but no right atrial or right ventricular
diastolic collapse (may be absent in settings of pulmonary
artery hypertension).

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-6-16**], the
pericardial effusion findings are new and c/w impaired
filling/early tamponade physiology
.
TTE [**7-4**] 11:08am
There is a large pericardial effusion. There is right
ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology
.
TTE [**7-4**] 11am
Post pericardiocentesis. There is a small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Compred to the pre-tap study from today, the
pericardial effusion is smaller and tamponade has resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
86y/o F with h/o AFIB, Lacunar CVA, s/p nephrostomy tube for
nephrolithiasis, and recent ICU admission for sepsis who
presents with weakness for the past few days.  She was admitted
through the ED from [**Hospital3 **] because her nephrostomy tube
had fallen out. Pericardial effusion was incidentally found on a
CT abd/pelvis.
Pt was transferred to CCU for findings suggestive of cardiac
tamponade physiology on ECHO [**7-3**]. Her clinical status worsened
overnight. In the morning of [**7-4**] pt underwent emergent bedside
pericardiocentesis. She went into resp failure and was placed on
ventilatory support. The decision to make her [**Date Range 3225**] was made by
her HCP and she was kept on morphine drip titrated for comfort.
She went into asystolic arrest on [**7-4**] 6:30pm. She was DNR per
her HCP.
.
# Pericardial effusion - Echocardiography shows moderate to
large pericardial effusion with impaired ventricular filling c/w
early tamponade physiology. Diff dx of pericardial effusion
includes viral, neoplastic (hx of breast CA), uremic, CHF, fluid
overload from renal failure. Uremic unlikely as BUN of 38, and
in ARF, baseline Cr of 0.7-1.0.  AM of [**7-4**] echo showed
increased severity of tamponade and pt appeared cold and
nonperfusing. Bedside pericardiocentesis performed with
resolution of tamponade on post-pericardiocentesis ECHO. She
continued to decompensate and was placed on respiratory support
per HCP wishes.
.
#. Hypotension: Initially presented to the floor with labile
blood pressures, but pressures were fluid responsive and
thereafter remained stable; there was no clinical evidence
suggestive of sepsis. She was transferred to CCU for management
of cardiac tamponade. She was noted to be hypotensive with low
urine output which did not resolve after pericardiocentesis. She
was started on pressors, intubated and continued to be
hypotensive sbp 60-100. Decision was made by her hcp to make her
[**Date Range 3225**] and she was taken off all support except morphine drip
titrated for comfort.
.
# Dyspnea - Unsure etiology. Bilateral pleural effusions on CT
scan and X-ray likely [**12-30**] tamponade physiology and elevated L
sided pre
