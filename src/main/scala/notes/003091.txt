Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Heart Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with CAD s/p CABG [**2086**] h/o PCI to SVG and PDA
([**2108**]) and to ostial, proximal Lcx and distal Lcx ([**2110**]),
systolic CHF (LVEF 50%), HTN and HLD, who presented initially to
OSH with chest pain beginning around 8PM on night of admission.
He was in his usual state of health until 2 days ago when he was
wading in the pool at his senior center and had brief transient
chest pain that spontaneously resolved.  On the afternoon of
admission, he felt fatigued and "off" in general.  He walked to
a function at the senior center and then sat down where he
developed gradual onset dull chest pressure in the lower chest
radiating in a band and downward to his abdomen.  He had
associated SOB, diaphoresis, and nausea.  Denied
lightheadedness, back/jaw/arm pain.  He became more and more
uncomfortable and thus EMS was called.

At the OSH, ECG showed inferior ST elevations and anterior ST
depressions.  There he received atorvastatin, aspirin full dose,
metoprolol 5mg IV, and nitro SL x2 with resolution of chest
pain.  He was not started on anticoagulation due to a reported
history of hemoptysis (described by patient as specks of blood
with cough).

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were 98.2 76 161/83 18 97% 2L
NC.  Labs and imaging significant for trop <0.01, creatinine
1.2, WBC 10, HCT 45, INR 1.0.  ECG showed ST elevation [**Hospital1 1105**] and
ST depression anteriorly.  Received SL nitro 0.4mg once and then
was started on a nitro drip for hypertension (no further chest
pain).  He was also started on a heparin drip but not [**Hospital1 4532**]
loaded (guaiac was negative).  Vitals on transfer were afebrile,
94 157/83 17 100% RA.

On arrival to the floor, he is chest pain free.  Denies SOB,
lighteadedness or abdominal pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough. He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. Cardiac review of systems is notable
for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
EKG [**2113-9-14**]:  sinus rhythm at 97 bpm with prolonged AV conduction
(1st degree heart block), normal axis, ST elevation [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
depression I, avL, V4-V6, q wave [**First Name3 (LF) 1105**]
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  [**2110**]: IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.
Moderate concentric LVH with mild regional systolic dysfunction
LVEF 50%. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Mild aortic and mitral
regurgitation.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2113-9-15**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypo-to akinesis of the basal and mid-inferior segments, and
near-akinesis of the mid- and distal septum, distal anterior
wall and the apex (multivessel CAD). The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 35-40%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-9-2**],
distal LAD-territory regional LV dysfunction is new. The other
findings are similar.
.
CARDIAC CATH:  [**2110**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG -> PDA and LIMA -> LAD.
3. Systemic arterial hypertension.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial and proximal LCx.
5. Successful direct stenting of the distal LCx.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-->LAD and SVG-->PDA),
systolic CHF (LVEF 50%), HTN and HLD, who presented initially to
OSH with chest pain found to have ST elevations inferiorly and
ST depressions antero-laterally that improved with sublingual
nitroglycerin.
.
# STEMI: The patient presented with chest pain that was
suspected to be secondary to acute coronary syndrome given ST
depressions anteriorly and initial ST elevations in the inferior
leads.  His chest pain resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin
and ECG findings improved.  Likely vessels affected are LAD
territory potentially involving the LIMA.  The patient received
heparin drip and nitroglycerin drip.  He also received aspirin
325mg daily, and his rosuvastatin was increased from 20 to 40mg
daily.  His clopidogrel was continued, as was his home
lisinopril.  He had previously been taken off of a beta blocker
for episodes of bradycardia, but we started him on a low dose of
