HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 48340**] is a 41-year-old
male transferred from [**Hospital6 **] with hemoptysis
in the setting of large cell lung cancer invading into his
airway.  At [**Hospital6 **], the patient had presented
on the [**6-17**] with sudden shortness of breath and
hemoptysis.  He just had radiation treatment that day.  He
had decreasing O2 saturations and chest x-ray showing right
upper lobe cavitary lesion with surrounding opacification.
The patient was intubated.  At the [**Hospital6 **]
Intensive Care Unit, the patient ran temperatures up to 101
and white count up to 23.  He was treated with levofloxacin
and Flagyl for postobstructive pneumonia.  The patient also
had a hematocrit drop from 32 to 23 and was transfused packed
red blood cells and fluid resuscitated.  Bronchoscopy at
[**Hospital6 **] showed the right main stem mass
extending into the trachea with large clot distally.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for repeat bronchoscopy and stent placements.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. PPD positive from [**2148**], however, he has had negative
acid-fast smears presumably secondary to a vaccination in
Europe.
2. Large cell lung cancer presented in [**2152-2-9**] with
hemoptysis.
3. XRT and chemotherapy.
4. The patient has metastasis to the left humerus based on
previous bone scan.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Versed drip.
2. Morphine prn.
3. Fentanyl drip.
4. Levofloxacin.
5. Flagyl.
6. Zantac.
7. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is not married.  Lives with his
brother and kids, although recently is living on his own.  He
is a smoker since the [**2129**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  He came to the US from Poland in [**2147**].

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8, blood
pressure 112/66, heart rate 101, respiratory rate 25, pulse
oximetry is 100%.  The patient was sedated in no apparent
distress.  The pupils are constricted and reactive
bilaterally.  Bilateral breath sounds anteriorly with rhonchi
invented sounds.  Cardiac regular, rate, and rhythm,
tachycardic, no murmur.  Abdomen is positive bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, nondistended.  He is guaiac negative per
[**Hospital6 **] Emergency Department.  Extremities:
The patient was moving all extremities and no edema.
Multiple dark brown 1 cm round lesions were noted on his
anterior legs and right shoulder.  Neurologic examination is
nonfocal.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Sodium of 138, potassium 4.1,
chloride 105, bicarb 21, BUN 10, creatinine 0.5, and glucose
96.  White count was 12.1, hematocrit 25.8, platelet count of
394.  Coags were normal.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The patient was in sinus rhythm with a
tachycardia, no acute ST changes.

The patient was maintained in the MICU on the ventilator with
Fentanyl and Versed sedation.  He was stable status post
transfer.  The patient then underwent high resolution lung CT
scan and airway tracheal CT scan prior to Interventional
Pulmonology procedure.  On Monday, the [**2-20**], the
patient was taken to the operating room by the Interventional
Pulmonary team, his larynx was examined to be within normal
limits.  Tumor tissue was visualized in the distal trachea on
the right lateral wall with narrowing of the lumen to about
50%.  No endobronchial lesions in the left lung airway were
noted.  There was extensive tumor tissue in the right lung
airways with narrowing of the lumen to 20-30%.  A cavitary
lumen opens into the right mainstem bronchus.  A dynamic
Y-stent [**62**] mm in size was placed in the distal trachea during
the procedure of less than 50 mL of blood were lost.

The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.
The evening following the procedure, the patient was
extubated without any difficulty.  The patient had no
complications overnight and on Tuesday, [**2-21**], the
patient was stable.  His family was present and talking with
the patient.  He did complain of some anxiety and was given
some Ativan.  The patient is to be transferred back to [**Hospital6 11241**] for definitive home care and further
oncological treatments.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital6 **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Nonsmall cell lung cancer invading into
airway.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Flagyl.
2. Levofloxacin.
3. Famotidine.
4. Tylenol prn.
5. Ativan prn.
