fever, rash

Skin Biopsy


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79 yo female with history of hyperlipidemia, depression,
who is also on anti-psychotics for psychiatric/behavior issues
who presents with one week of rash and oral mucosal lesions. The
rash was accompanied by fevers to 102 one day after the rash and
flu-like illness inlcuding cough non-productive of sputum, nasal
drainage, nausea, chills and rigors, headache. Patient reports
onset of rash approximately one week ago on Sunday, when she
noted an erythematous, maculopapular rash on her palms that
eventually spread towards her trunk, arms, legs and back and
soles. Rash also appeared targetoid in nature mostly on her
abdomen. She was also have great difficulty swallowing due to
the oral lesions in her mouth. Denies any issues with eye or
vaginal lesions. Patient denies any sick contacts. The patient
eventually became dehydrated and weak to the point that she was
unable to rise from bed, so she presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED on
[**2102-2-2**] evaluation and was started on Ciprofloxacin (after the
rash started) for presumed UTI. She denied any other new
medications including allopurinol, other antibiotics, or new
anti-epileptics. She was taking NSAIDs (ibuprofen) for her
fever. She is on anti-psychotics chronically including She
followed up with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2102-2-3**] who stopped the antibiotic.
She was referred to the ED today by her PCP due to concern for
progressing [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **]-Syndrome.
.
In the emergency department, VS were 98.4 125 123/86 16 97% RA.
Pt received viscous lidocaine, Vancomycin 1 gram IV x1, Cefepime
IV x1. Labs were significant for lactate of 3.6, ALT 132, AST
119, WBC 6.6, Hct of 30.9, Trop-T of 0.17. Lactate initially
3.6->2.4 with 1.5 L of IVFs. Dermatology was consulted in the
ED, and thought rash was due to erythema multiforme , and
recommended admission for supportive care, prednisone, and
performed a punch biopsy of the skin lesions and DFA/culture of
an oral mouth lesion.
.
Also in the ED, patient was initially in sinus tachycardia to
120s but would intermittently burst into paroxysms of atrial
fibrillation with RVR into the 170s and would become tachypneic
and short of breath, concerning for flash pulmonary edema.
Cardiology was consulted for possible cardioversion, but pt
converted spontaneously. Cards performed a bedside TTE which per
ED report showed normal EF and no depressed global ventricular
function. Cardiology recommended starting metoprolol or
amiodarone for the atrial fibrillation.

STUDIES:
CXR: [**2102-2-4**] #1 Bilateral small pleural effusions, with
associated basal opacities, which likely represent atelectasis.
More confluent right base opacity, can not exclude early/mild
consolidation.
.
CXR: [**2102-2-4**] #2 Bilateral pleural effusions, with mild pulmonary
edema. Bibasilar opacities likely representing atelectasis.
.
CXR: [**2102-2-5**] There is interval improvement in pulmonary edema,
currently almost completely resolved. Bibasilar opacities
accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions are still present and
might represent multifocal infection versus residue of pulmonary
edema. Given the accumulation of pleural effusion since
yesterday, they are potentially reactive to the pulmonary
process, thus multifocal infection would be a consideration.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and grossly unremarkable.

.
ECHO: [**2102-2-4**] The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild to moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion. Suboptimal image quality. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with mild-moderate global
biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (tachycardia,
toxin, metabolic, etc.). Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

MICRO:
- DFA of oral mucosal lesion for HSV-1 and 2 could not be
performed secondary to inadequate sample.
- mycoplasma negative
.
PATH: Skin biopsy of lesion on R abdomen performed by
dermatology: Sparse superficial dermal mast cell and lymphocytic

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo F with HLD, depression/psychiatric issues on
anti-psychotics who presents with fever, skin rash with oral
mucosal lesions concerning for [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome, also
incidentally noted to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular rate. She was originially admitted to the
Medical ICU due to concern for SJS/TEN in concert with her Afib,
however she was moved to floor after one day in the MICU as she
was stable. Her brief hospital course, by problem is as follows:
