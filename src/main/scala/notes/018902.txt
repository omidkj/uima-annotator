History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32913**] is an 80-year-old male who presented from rehabwith
respiratory distress. This was in the setting of recent
hospitalization ([**141-12-2**])  during which he was
treated for a florid urinary tract infection, acute kidney
injury, J-tube clogging, severe fluid imbalances, and intubation
for respiratory distress in the context of a LLL PNA which grew
out E.coli. All this took place after a duodenal perforation s/p
a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at an OSH on [**2146-6-2**], after
which he was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for repair of duodenal injury,
placement of lateral duodenostomy tube, feeding jejunostomy
tube, and PTBD (6/[**2146**]).

Past Medical History:
Past Medical History: HTN, prostate CA, duodenal ulcer

Past Surgical History: partial gastrectomy with BII
reconstruction, prostatectomy with bilateral inguinal node
dissection, laparoscopic cholecystectomy

Social History:
He lives in a long term care facility. He does not drink
alcohol, and has not smoked for 20 years.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

1) CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2146-8-7**]): An endotracheal tube is
positioned 4.2 cm above the level of the carina.  A nasoenteric
catheter courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the
stomach.  A left PICC is in unchanged position terminating in
the mid SVC.  There is consolidation within the left lung base.
which appears similar to prior examination and likely reflects
atelectasis or resolving pneumonia.  No new confluent opacity is

identified.  There is no pneumothorax.  Blunting of the
bilateral costophrenic angles is unchanged from prior and likely
suggests possible small effusions. There is no overt
interstitial edema.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
within normal limits. IMPRESSION: Expected position of support
devices.  No pneumothorax. Persistent retrocardiac opacity
possible atelectasis or resolving pneumonia. Probable small
bilateral pleural effusions.

2) BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS ([**2146-8-7**]): [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler
images of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, deep
femoral, popliteal and calf veins demonstrate normal flow,
compressibility and response to augmentation. IMPRESSION: No
evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral lower
extremities.

3) CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2146-8-7**]): There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or infarction.  Prominence of the
ventricles and sulci is compatible with age-related global
atrophy, unchanged.  There is mild left cavernous carotid artery
calcification. No osseous lesions are seen.  There are mucosal
retention cysts and mucosal thickening within the maxillary
sinuses.  A small amount of aerosolized secretions are seen
within the left sphenoid sinus.  The mastoid air cells are
grossly clear. IMPRESSION:  Age appropriate volume loss and mild
carotid calcification.
Otherwise normal study. No evidence of acute intracranial
process.

4) CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ([**2146-8-7**]):
Wet read- bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right. given
history, an aspiration is certainly possible. dense
atherosclerotic calcifications. hypodense vascular space
consistent with anemia. unchanged right upper lobe pulmonary
nodules. known multiple biliary drains and stent from prior
procedure with bile leak. scattered free fluid however no focal
collection or evidence of abscess.

MICRO/PATH:
   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2146-8-7**]):
      >25 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper
respiratory
      secretions. Bacterial culture results are invalid.
      PLEASE SUBMIT ANOTHER SPECIMEN.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2146-8-7**]):
      TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED.

   LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.

   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):
      GRAM STAIN OF THIS SPECIMEN INDICATES CONTAMINATION WITH
      OROPHARYNGEAL SECRETIONS AND INVALIDATES RESULTS.
      Specimen is only screened for Cryptococcus species. New
specimen is

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old male s/p CCY complicated by duodenal perforation
with multiple drains in place and recently discharged after
prolonged hospital course where he was treated for pan sensitive
Ecoli pneumonia to rehab who presents with acute respiratory
distress and leukocytosis.

On [**2146-8-7**]: The patient was tachypnic on admission and hypoxemic
with increased oxygen requirement. He was intubated, and his CXR
post-intubation revealed stable infiltrates bilaterally. He was
admitted to the medical ICU. ABG revealed a non-anion gap
acidosis without appropriate respiratory compensation. CT Chest
revealed on PNA, and LE ultrasound revealed no DVT. He was
continued on TPN. He was started on vancomycin, cefipime, and
flagyl empirically given a leukocytosis without a left shift and
no obvious initial course. Blood and urine cultures were
obtained. CT abdomen and CT head were obtained.

On [**2146-8-8**]: The patient remained intubated and sedated, on
CMV/Assist settings. His care was transferred to the Surgical
ICU team. He was continued on TPN, and remained NPO, with
nothing but medication by J tube. Antibiotics as stated above,
were continued.

On [**2146-8-9**]: The patient's ventilator settings were adjusted to
CPAP/PS. He was continued on
