HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year-old man
who had undergone a pylorus sparing Whipple procedure on
[**2117-12-11**] for intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of
the pancrease.  The patient presented to the Emergency
Department on [**2119-12-14**] complaining of three weeks of
intermittent nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain.  The
patient reports that the abdominal pain and nausea and
vomiting became most severe the night prior to admission with

urinary symptoms, but did report that his urine had become
dark recently.  The patient also reports having pruritus and
has recently started taking Atarax.

chronic pancreatitis.
2.  History of diabetes.

1.  Pylorus sparing Whipple procedure in [**2117-12-11**].
2.  Incisional hernia repair status post Whipple procedure
[**2119-1-24**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile
temperature of 96.9.  Heart rate 80.  Blood pressure 121/64.
Respiratory rate 18.  Sating 95% on room air.  The patient
was alert and oriented times three, jaundice in appearance.
The patient had icteric sclera.  The neck was supple.  There
was no JVD.  Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and
rhythm.  S1 and S2.  No murmurs were heard.  Respirations
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdominal examination
showed a well healed incision from the Whipple procedure with
bowel sounds soft, nondistended, but mildly tender in the
right upper quadrant.  Extremities were warm and without any
edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 17.1 with
neutrophil of 77%, lymphocytes of 18%, hematocrit 41.9 and
platelets 469.  PT 12.  PTT 23.8 with an INR of 1.0.
Chemistries sodium 141, potassium 3.9, chloride 103, CO2 27,
BUN 11 and creatinine 0.7 and glucose of 167.  AST 49, ALT
48, alkaline phosphatase 338 with a total bilirubin of 6.7,
amylase 19, lipase 7.  The patient had a recent CAT scan
dated [**2119-12-11**], which did not show any recurrence of
the IPMT.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's significant past
medical history and his surgical history of having gone a
Whipple procedure and the patient's current state of biliary
obstruction and symptoms of chills the patient was suspected
of having obstructive jaundice and cholangitis.  The patient
was made NPO and was put on intravenous fluids and was
started on Amp, Levo and Flagyl empirically.  The patient was
sent for an ERCP urgently, however, the patient's biliary
anastomosis could not be reached by the endoscope therefore
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography could not be
performed.  Because the patient's bilary obstruction could
not be relieved the patient was sent to the interventional
radiology for percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and
the patient underwent procedures successfully without any
complications.  Upon admission the patient was found to have
occasional fever spikes to 101 on hospital day one and two.
The patient was pan cultured.  Blood cultures ultimately did
not grow out any bacteria, however, the bile cultures drawn
from the PTC2s grew out pan sensitive E-coli and pan
sensitive Enterococcus and the bowel cultures specimens sent
on hospital day two also grew out pan sensitive E-Coli and
pan sensitive Klebsiella oxytoca.

The patient was still having a fever on hospital day two and
because his total bilirubin level had increased from 6.7 to
7.8 the patient was resent to the interventional radiology
for check of the catheter.  This was done without any
complications.  Although the patient still had a continuous
structure of the common bile duct at the biliary anastomosis
contrast flowed freely into the small bowel without any
difficulty, therefore the catheter was working properly and
the patient was continued on intravenous antibiotics and
Ampicillin, Levaquin and Flagyl.  The patient's total
bilirubin and his liver function tests were followed daily
and the patient's total bilirubin peaked at a level of 9.3 on
hospital day three and four with temperature spikes to
temperature max of 103.7 on hospital day four.  The patient
was carefully observed and continued on his intravenous
antibiotics.  The patient's total bilirubin gradually
decreased with the PTC2 draining dark bilious drainage and
the patient subsequently was doing well on intravenous
antibiotics.  On discharge the patient had been afebrile for
48 hours with total bilirubin trending down to a level of 6.0
from a peak of 9.3.  The patient's liver function tests
levels were within normal limits.  The patient was tolerating
a regular diet without any difficulty and without nausea and
vomiting.  The patient's abdominal pain decreased
significantly after the PTC and drainage with only mild
tenderness at the incision site of the PTC2.  This pain was
initially treated with po Percocet, but because the patient
became somnolent the patient was switched over to Tylenol #3
with good effect.  On hospital day eight the patient was
switched over to po Levaquin after confirming the
sensitivities on the E-Coli enterococcus and the Klebsiella
that grew out from the bile culture on admission the patient
was discharged home on [**2119-12-22**] on hospital day nine
to finish his po antibiotics course at home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  History of pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous
tumor status post Whipple procedure on [**2118-1-6**] found to have
cholangitis due to anastomotic stricture with E-Coli,
Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterococcus.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient is to continue all of his
preoperative medications as listed above.  The patient is
also to complete a fourteen day course of Levaquin 500 mg po
q.d. for twelve more days.  The patient is also prescribed
Tylenol with codeine 300/30 mg one to two tables po q 4 hours
prn pain and Colace 100 mg po b.i.d. prn constipation.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in
his office on [**2120-1-1**] and is to undergo a 2
cholangiogram on the morning of the 22nd to check for
presence of biliary obstruction.
