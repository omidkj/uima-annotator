Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 7982**] is an 84 yo M with a history of biventricular heart
failure, atrial fibrillation, ICD and CAD s/p CABG who presented
today to Dr.[**Name (NI) 7914**] clinic for his usual follow up. On
evaluation the patient was found to be fluid overloaded and was
directly admitted to the CCU.
.
The patient reports that over the last 1.5 months he has had
progressive fatigue and weakness. During this time he has also
noted an increase in his weight from a baseline of 151 lb to a
peak weight of 171 lbs. Approximately a month ago the patient's
lasix was changed to torsamide which improved his weight by a
few pounds. However, the patient has continued to feel unwell.
He notes that prior to these changes, the patent had a decrease
in his digoxin from 1 tab daily to [**1-3**] tab every other day,
secondary to "toxicity". He notes not other acute issue
preceeding his decline including no chest pain, no acute
dyspnea, no change in his diet or other symptoms. He has had
persistent dyspnea on exertion for two months with 200 yards
walking, though he does not think that it has worsened.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2194-1-9**] echo:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls; the other walls are hyperdynamic. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with history of diastolic and systolic heart failure who
presents with significant volume overload.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure:  There was
likely a large contribution from tricuspid regurgitation. On
admission, patient noted to have 15-20 lb weight gain and
significantly elevated JVP. The precipitating event was unclear,
but possibly related to recent medication changes.  He was
started on a dopamine gtt and lasix gtt with good response in
terms of blood pressure and urine output. He diuresed ~1 L daily
for 4 days, after which lasix drip was slowly weaned and
outpatient diuretic-torsemide-was restarted.  Dopamine drip was
also weaned, and blood pressure fell back to baseline SBP 80s.
He was stabilized on a regimen of torsemide 50 mg in the morning
and 25 mg in the evening.  He will need electrolyte and
creatinine follow-up by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] addition, his digoxin dose
was increased to .0625 mg daily, and aminophylline
(theophylline) was started.  He will need levels checked on both
of these medications at his visit on [**2194-1-17**].
.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was anticoagulated on admission
for a history of atrial fibrillation.  He remained in AV paced
rhythm and anticoagulated throughout his stay.  INR on discharge
was 2.3.  INR follow-up will be with visiting nurse.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Creatinine on admission was
elevated from baseline 1.5-2.0 to 3.1.  This was most likely
prerenal in the setting of poor forward flow from heart failure.
 Creatinine improved to baseline with diuresis. Creatinine on
discharge was 2.0.
.
# Hematuria:  Patient was noted to have clots in his foley
catheter that were unable to be manually irrigated.  A triple
lumen 22-french catheter was placed, and continuous bladder
irrigation was started, with resolution of clots.  Urology was
consulted and recommended work-up of hematuria to include
abdominal CT, urine cytology, and outpatient follow-up for
cystoscopy.  CT did not show any stone or other clear inciting
abnormality.  An appointment was made with urology for
outpatient follow-up of the cytology and possible cystoscopy.

# Hypothyroid:  The patient was found to be hypothyroid with TSH
6.9.  This was likely attributable to amiodarone treatment.  Low
dose levothyroxine (25 mcg daily) was started.  He will need TSH
checked again in 6 weeks by his PCP.
.
# Pyuria:  The patient had WBC on urinalysis the day prior to
discharge.  Culture was not growing.  He will need to have a
repeat urinalysis at his appointment with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2 days.
