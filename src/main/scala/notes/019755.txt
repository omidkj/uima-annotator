Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
74 F with history of COPD (on 4LNC during day, 6LNC at night),
dCHF, Afib, HTN, HL, severe OSA, CAD presenting with hypoxia to
77% on 4LNC at nursing home.  Complains of a slight intermittent
cough for the last week, with what she describes as some slight
increase in sputum in the back of her throat, but is unable to
bring up any of it.  Denies any fevers.  Reports that she
doesn't feel short of breath.

In the ED, inital vitals were: 96.7, 66, 148/95, 24, 100% NRB.
CXR showed mild congestion of pulmonary vasculature with some
pulmonary edema, questionable effusion, and large RV.  No
consolidations noted on CXR.  Patient was given levofloxacin
750mg, methylprednisolone 80 mg x1, and nebulizers.  Was
reported to be confused by the ED, although seems to be
interactive, although her baseline mental status is uncertain at
the time of presentation.  Oxygen was weaned to nasal canula,
but continues to saturate in mid-80s on 4-6L NC.  Was not given
any fluids in the ED.  ABG was drawn but appears to be venous
blood, results were 7.41/48/27/31.  Patient was transferred to
the MICU for further management given her persistent
desaturation on 4L of O2.  Vitals on transfer were: 101/57, 67,
28-34, 80s on 4L

On arrival to the MICU, patient reports feeling fine, that her
breathing is at baseline.  Denies CP, SOB, chest tightness,
palpitations, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.

Of note, patient has been seen by palliative care in the past
and there had been discussions had regarding possible hospice
care.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 F with COPD, dCHF, Afib, HTN, HL, severe OSA, CAD presenting
with hypoxia

#. Hypoxia - no symptoms of dyspnea despite O2 saturation
readings of 77% on 4L at NH.  On past admission, chief
complaints has usually been for sensation of dyspnea.  On
arrival to the MICU, patient is doing well on her home regimen
of O2 supplementation, appropriately saturating in the high 80s
to low 90s given her history of COPD.  CXR with some mild
pulmonary edema, no signs of infection.  Differential would
include mucus plugging, and less likely CHF exacerbation, COPD
exacerbation, pneumonia. No acute process as she is asymptomatic
and at her baseline.  Nothing to suggest acute COPD flare or
infection.  Diuresed with lasix 40 mg IV x1, then restarted on
lasix 60 mg PO BID.  Continued on 4L O2 during day and 6L O2 at
night (home rates).  Continued neb treatments.

# ?Confusion - She is AAOx3, however some forgetfulness.
Possible [**2-12**] prior CVA.  Neurological exam otherwise grossly
normal

# COPD - Patient uses 4L O2 via NC during the day and 6L O2 via
NC at nights as an outpatient. No evidence of acute
exacerbation.  Continued standing ipratropium/albuterol nebs
with prn doses for SOB.  Continued home dose SL morphine PRN
dyspnea.

# Diastolic CHF - EF of >55% demonstrated on TTE from [**2205**].  RV
is enlarged on CXR.  Some evidence of pulmonary edema on her
CXR.  Diuresed as above.

# CAD- Continued ASA, losartan.

# Atrial fibrillation - Not on warfarin given history of SAH.
Not on any nodal agents for rate control

# HTN- Continued amlodipine, losartan

# HL- Continued simvastatin

# Severe OSA - patient did not tolerate CPAP in the past,
refuses CPAP now.  Continued 6L supplemental O2 when sleeping

# Primary hyperparathyroidism- Continued sensipar.  TSH <0.02,
however dose not changed per endocrinologist.  Added on
total/free T4, which will be reviewed by outpatient
endocrinologist.  Endocrinologist will contact patient for
follow-up appointment/necessary medication adjustments.

# Toxic multinodular goiter - Continued methimazole

# Seizure disorder - history of CNS lymphoma. Continued
lamotrigine.

# Neovascular glaucoma c/b right eye blindness - Continued
brimonidine drops, timolol drops and atropine sulfate drops

# Depression - Continued paroxetine and seroquel

# Transitional issues-
- f/u blood cultures, urine cultures pending at time of
discharge
- endocrinology follow-up regarding abnormal thyroid function
tests while inpatient
