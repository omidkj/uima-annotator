Haloperidol / Ativan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
   72yo Russian speaking M with CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**February 2132**] with
peak CK 1500, MB 85, Trop 2.41, DM as well as ESLD with
thrombocytopenia and variceal bleeding in the past who presents
with back pain and malaise.  On his prior [**Year (2 digits) **] with NSTEMI,
he was conservatively managed with BB, ASA and heparin gtt
without GPIIb/IIIa given his thrombocytopenia and varices.  Pt
is currently non-responsive and unable to cooperate with
interview.  However as per report from [**Hospital1 5595**], the pt was more
confused than his baseline this AM and was having respiratory
distress with stridor.  The pt was given racemic epi neb at [**Hospital1 5595**]
and EMS was called.  With the arrival of EMS, the pt denied any
chest pain, palpitations or sob.  The VS as per EMS was the
follows: 92/64, 96, 20, SaO2: 100% on RA FS of 232 with ECG in
NSR.  He was found to be actively stridorous with 2+ pitting
edema.  As per staff at [**Hospital1 5595**], the pt has been non-compliant with
his lactulose recently.
.
   In th ED, the pt was initially afebrile with stable VS but
was hypoxic with SaO2 of 100% on 3L.  As he was combative and
oriented x2, he was given ativan 2mg x2 and restrained with 1:1
sitter.  He was also given lasix 80mg IV x1 with diuresis of
1800cc.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
Head CT [**2132-6-10**]:
"Overall unchanged appearance of brain, without acute
intracranial
hemorrhage."
.

CXR [**2132-6-10**]:
"Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral
moderate amount of pleural effusion suggested on this portable
chest examination.  If confirmation is needed, a lateral view
could be very helpful to confirm the presence of pleural
effusion.  Efforts were made to deliver stat report to referring
physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **]."
.
CXR [**2132-6-13**]
"Continued cardiomegaly with improving mild congestive heart
failure.
More focal opacity in the right lung base likely reflects
pneumonia.
Persistent bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural
effusions, unchanged."
.
TTE [**2132-3-3**]:
LA: mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect
LV: mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. cavity size is
normal. distal inferior/infero-septal hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
RV: chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
Aortic root: mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated.
Aortic valve: leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis/sclerosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mitral valve: leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 73yo M with CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**2132-2-6**] as well as DM, HTN
and ESLD with cirrhosis complicated by esophageal varices,
encephalopathy and thrombocytopenia who presents with shortness
of breath and found to have elevated cardiac enzymes.
.
1.  CV:
A.  NSTEMI/CAD: Given his history of CAD s/p NSTEMI recently,
his shortness of breath in combination with positive cardiac
enzymes and ECG are consistent with another episode of ACS.
However as he is DNR/DNI and has significant liver disease
complicated by history of esophageal varices and
thrombocytopenia he was considered high risk for further
intervention (cardiac catheterization or thrombolytics).  After
discussion with cardiology service who saw the pt on the floor,
the pt was transferred to the CCU for medical management of his
ACS. Patient was monitored on telemetry and followed with serial
ECGs. No heparin gtt, GPIIb/IIIa or Plavix at this time given
his coagulopathy and bleeding risk. Patient was also not taken
for cardiac catheterization given his bleeding risk and overall
poor functional status. He was continued on ASA 325 mg once
daily. Patient was initially on metoprolol but this was briefly
switched to sotalol in the setting multiple runs of
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. He was switched back to a
low dose of metoprolol on discharge. No statin was initiated
given his known underlying liver disease.
.
B.  CHF: The pt has intact biventricular function as per last
TTE, however has clinical evidence of volume overload which may
be due to RHF/LHF or due to ESLD. The patient received Lasix IV
in the ED with good diuresis and was then slightly hypotensive.
Additional diuretics were held initially and then were restarted
as his blood pressure tolerated. His volume status was monitored
and he was restarted on his home dose of spironolactone.
Furosemide was also restarted on day of discharge.  His volume
status should continue to be followed at rehab.
.
C.  Rhythm: Had multiple runs of VT [**Date range (1) 54651**]. Initially given
lidocaine 50 mg x 2, with little effect, then sotalol 40 mg,
with good response. Sotalol was discontinued on [**6-13**] (last dose
on am of [**6-12**]) with no further episodes of ventricular
tachycardia. He was restarted on his usual low dose beta
blocker.

.
d.   Valves: No murmurs on exam. Pt previously had an TTE in
[**2132-3-3**].  ECHO was not repeated during this [**Date Range **] as was
unlikely to change clinical management.
.
2.  Altered MS: The differential for this is broad, but includes
ACS, hepatic encephalopathy, possibly secondary to acute
decompensation of liver disease (Portal vein thrombosis, tips
failures, etc), med/toxin (given Ativan in ED x 2).  Head CT was
negative for any acute bleed. Patient was initially very
agitated in the ED and received Ativan.  He was then
intermittently agitated and confused during his stay; he was
oriented to self only. By report patient is confused at baseline
and had some non-compliance with lactulose at rehab, so this w
