Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
central venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
68yoM, nursing home resident, w/ pmh sig for Alzheimer's
dementia and hydrocephalus s/p shunt who was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED from the NH today because of five days of diarrhea, one day
of vomitting, and increased confusion/agitation. Found to have
partial SBO, aspiration pneumonia, now with blood cultures
positive for GPC. On CTX/azithro/vanco/Flagyl There have been no
recent fevers or chills, sob.  He has had a dry cough today.
Per so, a stool sample was sent for c diff at the nursing home.
Son states that at baseline pt can be combative and agitated but
is also more verbal.  There has been no blood in diarrhea or
melena.
.
ROS: No suggestion of back pain, headache, visual changes,
dysuria, hematuria.
.
In the ED he had a CT of the head, abd, as well as a cxr.
Neurosurg evaluated pt and noted milf increase in ventricular
size, but felt that shunt malfuntion or infection was unlikely.
In addition, the surgical team evaluated the patient out of
concern for partial sbo given vomitting and ct abd with ? of
sbo.  Per surgical note, pt has likely partial sbo or ileus.  An
NG tube was placed and the team recommended no surgery, but NG
tube, npo.
.
In the ED patient had a fever to 103, leukocytosis, no other
abnl vital signs, lactate > 2.  A femoral line was placed and pt
was given CTX, azithromycin, flagyl.


Past Medical History:
Alzheimer's dementia, Bipolar disorder, PVD, DM2,
Hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt (son says it was placed 3-5 years ago

.
pCXR: 1. Nasogastric tube seen within the body of the stomach
and coursing off the imaged field of view.
2. Bilateral airspace disease reflecting evolving pneumonia or
asymmetric pulmonary edema.
.
CXR: Interval removal of nasogastric tube.

Patchy airspace opacities, unchanged. Diagnostic considerations
again include pneumonia and asymmetric pulmonary edema.
.
CT Abd/pelvis: 1. Air-filled dilated loops of small bowel, with
collapsed distal loops, suggesting partial small bowel
obstruction. No free air or free intraabdominal fluid is
identified.
2. Confluent consolidative opacities in the right middle and
lower lobes. Differential includes pneumonia versus aspiration.
.
CT head: 1. Compared to previous study dated [**2187-3-6**],
the ventricles appear slightly more dilated and therefore
recommend evaluation to rule out shunt malfunction .

2. Interval resolution of right subdural collection.
.
Video swallow: Fluoroscopic assistance was provided for the
speech/language pathology service with the radiologist present.
The patient swallowed barium of varying consistencies (thin
liquid, nectar-thick liquid, and pureed consistency barium). No
aspiration was seen throughout this examination. Bolus formation
with swallow initiation were appropriate with no premature
spillover or retention. No penetration or aspiration occurred.
The patient was able to cough throughout the examination and
expectorated thick clear sputum. No aspiration was noted prior
to and during the patient's coughing episodes.
.
CT Head: Stable prominence of lateral ventricles compared to
[**1-3**]. No acute intracranial abnormality including no
sign of hemorrhage.
.
CT Abd: 1. Resolved partial obstruction of small bowel. No free
air or free intra- abdominal fluid is noted.

2. Resolving right middle and lower lobe pneumonia or
aspiration.

3. Diffusely mild thickened bladder wall. This might be due to
cystitis.
.
TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of
[**2187-3-6**], the pericardial effusion has resolved.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) HTN: Had severely elevated BP while in house even >200/100 at
times. He also complained of chest pain and headache at times
with this, so he was started on long acting medications due to
him refusing meds at times. On toprol, hydralazine, and
lisinopril his BP was much better controlled.
2) Partial SBO: Initially presented with n/v. CT showed partial
SBO, surgery was consulted. Resolved with bowel rest. CT abd
showed resolved pSBO. Now toleating diet and passing stool.
3) Diastolic CHF: Had slightly elevated cardiac enzymes, but no
ECG changes. TnT peaked at 0.24, although MB fraction negative:
likely demand ischemia in the setting of HTN. TTE showed
preserved EF and no wall motion abnormalities. Improved with
aggressive BP control. Cont. ASA/toprol/lisinopril/statin.
4) h/o SIADH: on salt tabs at home, but Na stable off them
in-house. Cont. fluid restriction.
5) Hypothyroidism: continued on levothyroxine
6) Type II DM: holding glyburide/metformin for now. Continue pm
NPH; RISS. Can restart oral meds at NH as needed.
7) Diarrhea: C. diff (-) X 3, no diarrhea.
8) Aspiration PNA: developed sudden respiratory arrest while
eating dinner. Thought to be aspiration. Pt. was intubated and
transferred to ICU and started on levofloxacin and flagyl.
Patient passed video swallow.
9) GPC bactermia [**1-15**] bcx [**1-8**] CNS; [**1-4**] also w/ CNS.
Surveillance Cx negative.
10) Candiduria: d/c Foley
11) Fe def anemia: SPEP hypogamma; check folate, low/nl vit B12,
hold iron pending completion of levo course
12) Full Code
13) Dispo: Back to NH
