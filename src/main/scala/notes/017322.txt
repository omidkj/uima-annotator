Chief Complaint:
Mental Status Change

Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
72 year-old female with a history of Stage V CKD on HD, DM, CAD,
CHF EF 30-40% who presented from her nursing home on [**8-28**] found
lethargic with hypoglycemia (FS 39). After IM glucagon, repeat
glucose was 25. EMS was called and she received 1amp D50 prior
to presentation to the ED.
Of note, the patient has had similar presentation (hypoglycemia,
AMS) multiple times this year [**1-26**] Urinary tract infections.
Patient is wheelchair bound at baseline due to significant RA
involvement of lower extremities. She is alert and oriented to
person and place but has a poor short term memory per the
daughter. She is incontinent of urine/stool at baseline.
.
In the ED, VS T 101.8 HR 62 BP 111/26 RR 20 POx 98% on 2.5L NC.
Patient remained lethargic, and was given 2 amps of D50 and
D51/2NS . EKG was obtained without changes from baseline. CXR
showed mild pulmonary edema. U/A concerning for UTI and she was
given a dose of levofloxacin. Given her fever and MS, LP was
considered but the patient's family refused so she was started
on Vanc/Ceftriaxone for empiric therapy for meningitis. Blood
and urine cultures were sent.
In MICU, there was again concern for meningitis, but pt.'s
family again refused LP so she was started on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
empirically. Her glucoseincreased to 80 with multiple amps of
D50. By 10:30pm, her gluocse stabilized. Insulin held overnight.
She tolerated breakfast in the am and glucose rose into the
200s. Insulin restarted with sliding scale and she was
transitioned to half of her home dose begun (NPH 7 in AM, 1
qpm).


Past Medical History:
-CAD, s/p "silent MI" per patient
-CHF, systolic dysfunction with EF 30-40%
-3+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ TR
-DM, type 2
-ESRD on HD
-Gout
-Depression
-GERD
-Rheumatoid arthritis
-Anemia
-Hypercholesterolemia

Social History:
Lives at nursing home. Has 6 children that live locally. Quit
smoking in the [**2142**]; previously smoked approx 5cigs/day x30
years. Rare EtOH.


Family History:
Multiple family members with DM II, otherwise non-contributory.

NEURO: Initially somnolent, responding to noxious stimuli,
following command to squeeze hands b/l. AFter 30mins, became
alert, oriented to person, and place ( which is baseline per
daughter). CN II ?????? XII grossly intact. Moves all 4 extremities.
Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities. Patellar DTR +1.

Pertinent Results:
CT Head
Final Report
INDICATION: 72-year-old with type 2 diabetes, renal failure,
CHF, and
hypoglycemia. Evaluate for acute pathology.

No prior examinations.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, or
mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent
with age-
related involutional changes. Right-sided basal ganglia
calcifications are
noted. The cavernous carotids are moderately calcified. The
visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized
and aerated.
The osseous structures and soft tissues are normal. There is
evidence of
bilateral cataract surgery.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology including no
evidence of
hemorrhage.

Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The patient meets at least [**1-27**]
modified CARE-HF criteria for ventricular dyssynchrony, and may
benefit from resynchronization therapy. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic root. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: In the ED, VS T 101.8 HR 62 BP 111/26 RR 20 POx
98% on 2.5L NC. Patient remained lethargic, and was given 2 amps

baseline. CXR showed mild pulmonary edema. U/A concerning for
UTI and she was given a dose of levofloxacin. Given her fever
and MS, LP was considered but the patient's family refused so

family again refused LP so she was started on Vanc/Ceftriaxone
empirically. Her glucose increased to 80 with multiple amps of
D50. By 10:30pm, her gluocse stabilized. Insulin held overnight.
She tolerated breakfast in the am and glucose rose into the
200s. Insulin restarted with sliding scale and she was
transitioned to half of her home dose begun (NPH 7 in AM, 1
qpm).
.
The patient was transferred to the floor.  She was taken off
antibiotics and treated for UTI with Cipro.  Her glucose was
well controlled on half her home regimen. She also received HD
on Friday ([**8-30**]).
.
She will need her insulin titrated as tolerated and will
complete a 7 day course of Cipro.
