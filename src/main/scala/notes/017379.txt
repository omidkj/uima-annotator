[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   82 year old man with CABGx3
Final Report
HISTORY: 82-year-old male with history of CABG x 3. Assess
interval change.
PA and lateral radiographs are compared to [**2120-6-23**], [**2120-6-20**].
Compared to the
most recent radiographs, there is improved aeration at the
bases. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are not changed. There are no new
focal areas of consolidation. The cardiomediastinal contours are
stable. Biapical
thickening is stable compared to the pre-operative radiograph.
IMPRESSION: Improving bibasilar aeration. Persistent small
pleural
effusions.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2120-6-18**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mitral
valve leaflets not well seen. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Moderate (2+) MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired
relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
No PS.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded (eg, basal inferolateral
wall may be hypokinetic but is not well visualized). Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
Moderate (2+) anteriorly directed mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No cardiac source of embolus identified (cannot definitively
exclude; particularly, atrial thrombus is not well assessed by
transthoracic echocardiography).
