Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4373**]
Chief Complaint:
generalized tonic-clonic seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
61M who presents after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at
home on the morning of admission. According to patient's wife,
he was in bed on the morning of admission when his whole body
began to shake uncontrollably and he began foaming at mouth. The
episode lasted approximately 15 minutes before resolving
spontaneously. The patient's wife states that the patient has
had low grade fevers and a weight loss of 15 pounds over the
past month. For the past 3 days the patient has been
experiencing night sweats. He has never experienced a seizure
prior to the morning of admission.
.
As the patient was being transferred into the ambulance, he
began seizing once again. He was given 2 mg Ativan x 2, after
which time the seizure stopped; however, the patient's
respiratory status deteriorated quickly requiring RSI. On
arrival to ED, VS: T 100.8 rectal 106 24 100% on vent. He was
moving all extremities. Labs were significant for WBC 28.3,
lactate 10.2, INR 1.4. The patient was given vecuronium in order
to obtain a head CT. CT head showed large mass centered in left
frontal sinus with lytic bony destruction and posterior
extention into left frontal lobe. Neurology was consulted, who
recommended an MRI w/ and w/out contrast to r/o an infectious
process. Neurosurgery was consulted who agreed with STAT MRI.
Decision was made not to LP patient in ED given low likelihood
of infection. CXR showed a large right hilar pulmonary mass
causing post obstructive atelectasis. The patient was given
ceftriaxone and azithromycin. He was given Fosphenytoin 1000 mg
and Dexamethasone 10 mg IV X 1. Vent settings on transfer were:
FiO2 100%, RR 24, PEEP 5, O2 100%.
.
According to OMR notes, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] 3
weeks prior with flu-like symptoms and R shoulder pain. His CXR
showed a RUL consolidation, however there was concern for an
underlying lesion on a CT. He was treated witha  course of
Augmentin. After discharge from the hospital, he continued to
have low-grade fevers and night sweats. He had a bronchoscopy
performed at [**Hospital3 **] on Friday [**2118-11-25**] along with a biopsy of
a presumed lesion. The pathology results are pending at this
time.

IMAGING:
CT head w/o contrast ([**2118-11-28**])- Large predominantly
hyperattenuating mass centered in the left frontal sinus
associated with aggressive lytic osseous destruction and
posterior extension into the left frontal lobe, most concerning
for neoplastic process, particularly given known right lung
mass. Supervening infection must be considered. Recommend
correlation with prior exams when available, and MRI for
assessment of full disease extent.

MRI head w&w/o contrast ([**2118-11-28**])- Large heterogeneously
enhancing mass in the frontal sinus with intracranial extension
and destruction of inner and outer tables of the frontal sinus,
bilateral cribriform plates and invasion of the anterior portion
of the superior sagittal sinus. In view of history of lung mass,
this is likely to represent metastasis. However, a primary sinus
neoplasm with intracranial lesion cannot be entirely ruled out.
Wegener's granulomatosis is another differential consideration.

CT head w&w/o contrast ([**2118-11-28**])- Large peripherally enhancing
mass centered predominantly in frontal sinuses with associated
vasogenic edema and mild mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral ventricle. Adjacent bones demonstrate a permeative
destructive pattern. The above findings are most compatible with
metastatic disease, given the reported history of right upper
lung mass lesion.  Alternative differential considerations
include aggressive infectious, inflammatory processes or a
primary sinus neoplasm.

EEG ([**2118-11-28**])- This portable bedside EEG gives evidence for
focal slowing
in the left frontal quadrant compatible with a structural lesion
of that
area with superimposed high voltage interictal epileptiform
transients
in the left frontal polar region and short runs of brief
electrographic
seizure activity that were without any obvious clinical
accompaniment.

EEG ([**2118-11-29**])- This EEG gives evidence for a focal slow wave
abnormality
over the left frontal polar region suggestive of a
subcortical/cortical
junctional structural abnormality. Superimposed upon this are
frequent
epileptiform discharges in short runs of epileptic activity
without a
clear clinical accompaniment.

CT Abd/pelvis ([**2118-11-29**])-
1. Right hilar mass with mediastinal invasion and a right
paratracheal mass or nodal conglomeration. Probable malignant
right pleural effusion.
Bilateral adrenal metastasis, left greater than right.
2. Near complete collapse of the right upper lobe due to
bronchial
obstruction. Partial compression of the right lower and right
middle lobe
bronchi with resulting areas of postobstructive pneumonia in the
right lung.
3. Indeterminate right renal mass. The differential would
include metastatic disease to the right kidney or a primary
renal lesion and biopsy should be considered to help
differentiate between these two possibilities.
4. Soft tissue nodule posterior to the left psoas muscle in the
retroperitoneum.

CT Chest ([**2118-11-29**])-
1. Right hilar mass with mediastinal invasion and a right
paratracheal mass or nodal conglomeration. Probable malignant
right pleural effusion.
Bilateral adrenal metastasis, left greater than right.
2. Near complete collapse of the right upper lobe due to
bronchial
obstruction. Partial compression of the right lower and right
middle lobe
bronchi with resulting areas of postobstructive pneumonia in the
