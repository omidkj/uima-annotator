Chief Complaint:
High grade AV block

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic Valve Replacement (#19 mm pericardial tissue
valve)/Permanent Pacemaker -[**7-9**]

History of Present Illness:
83 year old female with known Aortic Stenosis presents with
Dyspnea on exertion and angina. She was admitted with critical
Aortic Stenosis,and found to be in 3rd degree AV block on
telemetry. She had been followed by outpatient cardiology but
the day before admission had gotten Dyspneic with exertion and
chest pain at rest. Called 911 and taken to OSH. Echo showed
critical Aortic Stenosis and transferred here from OSH. Cath
showed clean coronaries. Third degree heart block noted  and she
was seen by EP for placement of a permanent pacemaker.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted for surgical intervention/Aortic
Replacement.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
is seen in the LAA. Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) No
thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Critical AS (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe
mitral annular calcification. Minimally increased gradient
consistent with trivial MS. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
