Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Rectal bleed, change in MS, CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
76 y/o male w/ h/o rheumatic heart dz s/p mechanical mvr/avr,
afib (s/p VVI PPM); h.o CHF; s/p recent admit to [**Hospital1 18**] for 7 wks
(work up for valve leakage included TTE, TEE, MRI showing 2+ MR
perivalvular leakage; s/p cath x 2 with stenting of RCA and LAD;
s/p VVI pacemaker for chronic afib and prolonged attempts of
diuresis) who is being transferred from OSH today after
admission for hemorrhoidal bleed s/p surgical I and D of
thrombosed hemorrhoid on [**9-6**], followed by normal colonoscopy on
[**9-8**].  Since colonoscopy patient has had persistent increased
somnolence despite attempts to reverse sedatives with Narcan.
Patient got Fentanyl and Versed during colonoscopy, since then
all sedating meds were held but change in MS persisted.  Patient
was also found to have peri-rectal abscess but not transferred
on antibiotics.  During the same admission the patient was noted
to be in acute on chronic renal failure with Creat. of 2.3 from
1.8 (and K of 6) on admission therefore lisinopril and aldactone
were held.  Patient was continued on Lasix and had serial rising
BNPs from 723 on [**9-8**] to 1163 on [**9-11**].  Patient transferred per
family request for further management.
On admission initial ABG 7.29/77/237 during Nebulizer treatment,
next ABG 7.28/78/163, normal Lactate.

He was intubated and admitted to the CCU and extubated on
[**2128-10-9**]. He was then placed on a heparin gtt, lasix gtt,
dopamine gtt and nesiritide for diuresis. After transferring
back to the floor service, he failed to wean off the dopamine
and nesiritide and was readmitted to the CCU on [**2128-10-20**]. He
failed to tolerate an ACE and was restarted on dopamine which
was then weaned off. He is now on natrecor, bumex [**Hospital1 **].

Pertinent Results:
ECHO ([**2128-9-13**]):Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately
dilated.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
4. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. Trace aortic
regurgitation
is seen.
5. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. Mitral
regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified.
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
7. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2128-7-22**],
there has been no
significant change.

PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2128-10-13**]
IMPRESSION: A moderate to severe, fixed perfusion defect of the
inferior and
inferolateral myocardial walls and apex. Compared to the
previous scan, the
previously reversible perfusion defect in this region is now
fixed and the
apical perfusion defect has become more severe. The left
ventricle is enlarged.
Wall motion is normal with a calculated left ventricular
ejection fraction of
50%.

RIGHT AND LEFT HEART CATHETERIZATION:
  1.  Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a
right-dominant
circulation with three-vessel coronary artery disease.  LMCA was

angiographically-normal.  LAD had a widely patent proximal
stent, and
was subtotally occluded in the very apical portion (slightly
progressed
from prior study).  LCx had a 60% origin stenosis at the site of
prior
PTCA, and a 70% lesion in a small-caliber mid-vessel.  RCA had a
40%
origin stenosis, a 50% distal stenosis, and a 70% lesion in the
posterolateral branch.  Prior RCA stents were widely patent.
  2.  Left ventriculography was deferred because of renal
insufficiency
and presence of aortic valve prosthesis.
  3.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mild pulmonary
hypertension
(39/16 mmHg), minimally elevated filling pressures (mean RA 6
mmHg, mean
PCWP 12 mmHg), and a preserved cardiac index of 2.9 L/min/m2.
These
represent marked improvement since prior hemodynamic assessment
in [**7-28**],
although current study was performed with patient receiving
intravenous
dopamine and nesiritide.
  4.  Right internal jugular venous sheath was sutured in place.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
  1. Three vessel coronary artery disease, minimally changed
from prior
angiography.
  2. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
  3. Minimally elevated filling pressures with preserved cardiac
output.
  3. Congestive heart failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
# CHF - On admission we placed a right IJ triple lumen catheter
for adequate access.  He was in decompensated CHF on exam and we
started treatment with Natrecor, Lasix, and dopamine drips.  He
was diuresed with these agents for several days with good output
and weight loss. He was converted to Lasix IV as a bridge to PO
and then converted to PO lasix once adequately diuresed.
Dopamine and Niseritide stopped after changeed to Po lasix. On
one occastion whie on lasix gtt pt had creatitine bump to 2.2.
This resolved when diuretics decreased. We initially held his
Digoxin, spironolactone, and ACE-I with a plan to re-start them
back gradually.  Pt was doing better from CHF stand point until
he was transfused and again decompensated requiring Natrecor and
Dopamine gtt.  Dopamine could not be weaned off since his BP
would drop without Dopa.  Pt then underwent right and left heart
cath to determine precise fluid status which showed PCWP of 12
and left cath showing 3 vessel dz.  Given his PCWP of 12 which
is much better than we expected, it was thought that he was
overdiuresed causing decline in BP.  He was transferred to CCU
for brief period of time for tailored therapy where Natrecor and
Dopamine gtt were weaned off and po Bumex and spironolactone
were started for diuresis.  He did not tolerate Captoril in CCU
because of drop in BP.  Once he returned to the floor, he was
slowly started on very low dose lisinopril, and then Coreg was
added in low dose.  These medications were slowly titrated up.
He remained net even for few days but became slightly overloaded
as he required multiple transfusion for his anemia.  Bumex was
increased to 2 mg [**Hospital1 **] which he responded well with daily net
negative I's/O's.  However, since spironolactone had to be
discontinued for hyperkalemia, Bumex was increased to 2mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was able to tolerate lisinopril 3.75 mg qd, Coreg 3.125 mg
[**Hospital1 **].  If his hyperkalemia resolves or if pt is hypokalemia,
would recommend adding back spironolactone.  At rehab, need to
closely monitor pt's weight and consider increasing Bumex
