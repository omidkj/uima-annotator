ECHO report:

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm)
with >55% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure
(0-5mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). Estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). TDI E/e' >15, suggesting
PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal descending aorta diameter.


AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views.
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Increased PCWP. Mild mitral regurgitation.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2158**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Head CT scan [**2161-2-17**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Grossly Unchanged left temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage with
minimal
decrease medially.
2. Unchanged [**Known lastname **] vessel ischemic disease and mild global
parenchymal
atrophy.
3. No new hemorrhage/ mass effect.

CT cervical spine [**2161-2-15**]

  IMPRESSION:
Multilevel degenerative changes and diffuse bony osteopenia;
however, no
evidence of acute fracture. Mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of C3
on C4 is not significantly changed from prior exam.

Please note that patient's initial head CT performed at outside
hospital was not submitted for second interpretation but is
located under the same clip number as cervical spine study.

IVC filter gram [**2161-2-17**]
Infrarenal IVC filter placement with the possibility to remove
the IVC filter in two weeks.

Chest plain film [**2161-2-18**]
 IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-16**]:

[**Known lastname 4460**] left pleural effusion is new. Increased pulmonary vascular
caliber and new septal lines indicate mild pulmonary edema.
Heart is normal size.
Thoracic aorta is generally enlarged. Paramediastinal
bronchiectasis and
fibrosis could be due to prior radiation, scar-like irregular
opacity at the lateral margin of the right upper lung is of
indeterminate chronicity, which would be helpful in assessing
its nature.





Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. The laceration just
above her left brow was irrigated and sutured. Sutures may come
out on [**2-20**]. She was transferred to the Trauma ICU for close
monitoring.

Neurosurgery was consulted for her subdural bleed which was
managed non operatively. Serial exams and CT scans were followed
and remained stable. She was on Dilantin at baseline and was
continued on this. There were no observed or reported seizure
activity. She will follow up in 4 weeks with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for
repeat head imaging.

Orthopedics was consulted given her left proximal humerus
fracture and left intratrochanteric fracture. she was taken to
the operating room on second hospital day for IM nail of the
intertrochanteric fracture. Because of her limited mobility
status and high risk for thrombus the decision was made to place
an IVC filter after family/team discussions. She will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] in 2 weeks.

She was noted with pulmonary edema on chest xray and was given
10 mg IV Lasix with adequate response. The Foley remains in
place for more accurate output monitoring.

She was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is
being recommended for skilled nursing facility after her acute
hospital stay.
