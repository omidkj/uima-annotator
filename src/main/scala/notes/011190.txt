Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2168-4-12**] - CABGx3 (Mammary artery to left anterior descending
artery, vein to ramus and vein graft to obtsue marginal artery);
Mitral valve Repair (26mm Annuloplasty Band)
[**2168-4-12**] - Flexible cystoscopy with wire placement and Foley

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81-year-old male who had increasing shortness of
breath. His workup revealed that he had a positive exercise
stress test. He underwent a cardiac
catheterization, and this demonstrated 3-vessel coronary artery
disease. It was recommended that he undergo coronary bypass
grafting and, after risks and benefits were explained to him, he
agreed to proceed.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Lipomatous hypertrophy of the
interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. Prominent Eustachian
valve (normal
variant).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Mild
regional LV
systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal
calcifications in
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Minimally increased
gradient c/w
minimal AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Moderate (2+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic
(normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Pericardial
calcifications.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications.

Conclusions:
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild to moderate mid
inferior
hypokinesis. LVEF 45-50%. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the arch and descending
thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets.The left coronary cusp may
have
decreased mobility. There is minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Aortic valve area
1.94 cm2 averaged on continuity, 2.24 cm2 averaged on
plainemetry. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The jet is
posteriorly directed
with a vena contracta from 4-6 mm in diameter. There is partial
restrictioin
of the postierior leaflet, most likely involving P2. There is a

trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are pericardial

calcifications.

Post Bypass: Patient is AV paced on epinepherine and
phenylepherine gtt. LV
function is improved with LVEF >55%. Septal wall motion is
consistent with av
pacing. Inferior wall motion is improved. There is a partial
mitral ring
prosthesis insitu. Peak and mean gradients are 3 mm Hg. There is
no residual
mitral regurgitation. Aortic contours are intact. Remaining exam
is unchanged.
All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
