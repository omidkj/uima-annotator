History of Present Illness:
 70 yo male with recent pancreatitis from pancreatic CA on TPN
sent in for fever and hypotension SBP70s concerning for sepsis.
Mr. [**Known lastname 35831**] was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to [**Hospital3 105**] in
[**Location (un) 38**] on [**2180-12-20**]. he has been admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] for
sork-up for a newly identified pancreatic mass found during a
recent episode of gallstone pancreatitis. ERCP was unable to
perform sphincerotomy or obtain brush sample secondary to
significant inflammation and edema. The patient was sent to
[**Location (un) **] NPO on TPN for bowel rest in the hope that there would
be a redcution in the edema so that a Whipple procedure might be
possible. He states that he was in his usual state of health at
[**Location (un) 38**] until his TPN was switched from a 12 hour cycle to a
16 hour cycle. He states that he then began to have severe,
non-bloody diarrhea - up to 20 bowel movements a day. Patient
states that he has been unable to sleep at all for the last
several days. Per report from the OSH, TPN was switched on [**12-28**]
and diarrhea began. On [**12-29**], mental status changed were noted
and the patient refused all medications. WBC count rose to 14.2
but the patient remained afebrile. Stools were sent for c.diff
and are pending. This am temp was 102, BP 85/50, HR 105, RR 20

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2181-3-5**] 3:14 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-28**], there is little
change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Low lung
volumes persist with some opacification at the left base that
could represent some combination of pleural effusion and
atelectasis.
The right subclavian PICC line extends to the lower portion of
the SVC.
.
ECHO
Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or clotis seen in the body of the
left atrium. . There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three mildly thickened aortic valve
leaflet with trace aortic regurgitation. There is no vegetation
on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened with mild (1+) mitral regurgitation but no vegetation.
No clear vegetation or regurgitation is seen on the tricuspid or
pulmonic valve. The atrial and ventricular ICD leads are
visualized and there are no massess or vegetations on the leads.
The atrial lead terminates in the right atrial appendage.
IMPRESSION: no evidence of endocarditis or myocardial abscess on
TEE.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2181-2-27**] 8:59 PM
IMPRESSIONS:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Post-surgical changes of Whipple, with moderate fat stranding
in the surgical bed, but no evidence of discrete fluid
collection to suggest abscess.
3. Enlarged lymph nodes in the chest are nonspecific.
4. Improving hepatic retractor injury.
5. Stable right adrenal nodule.
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2181-2-22**] 9:03 PM
IMPRESSION: Evolution of left hepatic lobe lesion which is now
more ill- defined with mixed echogenicity suggests that this was
related to acute injury as previously described. No other focal
hepatic lesions. No biliary ductal dilatation. Small amount of
fluid around the liver edge. Right pleural effusion incompletely
imaged.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2181-2-15**] 9:22 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post Whipple procedure and removal of surgical bed
drains. A couple of foci of gas are consistent with removal of
the drainage catheters, but no new fluid collections identified.
2. Decrease in size of a left lobe hepatic lesion likely
reflecting retractor injury.
3. Increased bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
4. Right adrenal nodule, unchanged.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2181-2-10**] 12:29 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Overall decrease in size of the previously noted several
small intraabdominal fluid collections. No new fluid collections
are identified.
2. No significant change in position of the surgical drains as
above.
3. Nonspecific filling defect seen in several loops of small
bowel that may be related to enteric feeds. Differential
diagnosis also includes blood clots.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2181-1-15**] 2:02 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings concerning for anastomotic leak at the
hepaticojejunostomy, within the lesser sac. There is no discrete
abscess formation at this time, however there is more gas than
expected at six days postoperatively. Close continued followup
is advised.
2. Likely r
