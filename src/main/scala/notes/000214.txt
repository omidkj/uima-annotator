the hospital because she was feeling dizzy and getting nauseous
again at 7:30 and came to the ED.

Above history from patient's mother who lives with her.

Studies
CXR [**2140-1-28**]: Low lung volumes with patchy opacities in the left
lung base,
likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be ruled out in the
correct clinical setting.

CXR [**2140-2-1**]: Severe bilateral pneumonia has not improved since
[**1-31**]. There is also a component of mild pulmonary edema
which is probably worsened. Heart size is top normal. No
pneumothorax. At least a moderate left pleural effusion is
presumed.

Chest CT w/o contrast [**2140-2-1**]: 1. Bilateral asymmetrically
distributed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving
the left lung to greater degree than the right, accompanied by
smooth septal thickening and bilateral pleural effusions.  These
findings likely represent a combination of multifocal pneumonia
and pulmonary edema. 2. Small pericardial effusion. 3. Anasarca
and small amount of ascites.
4. Healing sternal fracture and several anterior rib fractures,
which are not appreciated on the older CT of [**2139-9-15**] but
are age indeterminate.

CArdiac ECHO: IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size
and wall thickness with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. At least mild mitral
regurgitation. Very small to small, circumferential pericardial
effusion without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Left
pleural effusion. Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-1**], a
very small to small pericardial effusion is present. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure was not able to be determined
on the current study. Previously, at least borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hyperte
