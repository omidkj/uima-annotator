Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
77 yo female receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II breast
cancer who presents with generalized weakness/fatigue and DOE x
1 week and is found to be febrile to 103 in the ED.  She reports
feeling "wiped out" since her chemotherapy on [**8-4**] with
progressive generalized fatigue.  She then noted SOB with
extertion for the past week.  She has felt chilled at home but
could not get a reliable [**Location (un) 1131**] on her home thermometer.  She
denies cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.  She has also
had 2-3 days of diarrhea; improved now after one day of
immodium.  Also very poor appetite. Initially presented to
clinic where she was found to be hypoxic to 91% at rest and 88%
with exertion. She was afebrile at that time and was referred to
the ED for evaluation.  In the ED was found to be febrile to 103
but HD stable.  She was hydrated and given Levaquin for ? PNA.
Currently she feels much improved.

IMAGING:
========
[**2138-8-17**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - FINDINGS: Comparison is made to
previous study from [**2138-8-15**]. Cardiac silhouette and
mediastinum are within normal limits. There is coarsening of the
bronchovascular markings without overt pulmonary edema. There is
atelectasis in the left upper lobe. The right apex is within
normal limits. No pleural effusions or signs for overt pulmonary
edema is present.
.
[**2138-8-15**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY - CTA CHEST: No
evidence of filling defect to the subsegmental level to suggest
pulmonary embolism. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber
throughout. There are mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic
calcifications in the aorta and coronary arteries. Heart size is
normal. There is no central or axillary lymphadenopathy. There
is no pleural or pericardial effusion. A calcified 9 mm
perihilar nodule ((3:43) and a 4 mm lower lung nodule (3:82) was
noted. Right lower lobe scaring is noted. There no effusion or
consolidation. A 3.6 x 2.1 cm fluid collection is noted in the
left breast. Bone windows demonstrate moderate degenerative
changes. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism; 2.
Recommend 12 month followup for 4 mm lower lobe nodule; 3.
postsurgical changes in the left breast.
.
[**2138-8-15**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal and
hilar contours are unremarkable. The aorta is calcified and
tortuous. Again identified is bibasilar scarring, unchanged.
There is no consolidation or pleural effusions identified. The
osseous
structures are grossly unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No acute
cardiopulmonary process.
.
[**2138-4-21**] CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) - CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: The
heart size is at upper limits of normal. The aorta is calcified
and tortuous. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable. Linear left
upper lung and right lower lung opacities are consistent with
atelectasis or scarring. The lungs are otherwise clear. There
are no pleural effusions. Mild degenerative changes of the
thoracic spine are observed. IMPRESSION: No acute
cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo F w/ hx left breast grade III invasive breast CA s/p L
breast excision and recent adjuvant chemo (cytoxan and taxotere
on [**8-4**]), untreated LTBI in setting of known TB exposure
presented with one week of generalized weakness and fatigue on
[**8-15**].  Pt had chemo on [**8-4**] and reported generalized weakness
and decreased po intake. On [**7-14**], she was seen at [**Hospital 478**]
clinic and cbc showed wbc of 29.2 no differential available
(prior wbc on [**8-4**] was 6). Of note, had Neulasta on [**8-5**]. On
[**8-15**], pt was again seen in clinic where she was noted to be
hypoxic with sat 91% at rest and 88% with exersion. She also
complained of subjective fever, ?dry cough, emesis X3 and a
couple days of nonbloody watery stools. She also reported a 5lb
wt loss over past 6 weeks, but denied any night sweats, chills,
shortness of breath or hemoptysis.In ER she was febrile to 103
and received levaquin for possible pneumonia, however a CXR
showed no infiltrate. A CTA was performed which showed no PE,
but there R LL scaring and a calcified 9 mm perihilar nodule and
4 mm lower lung nodule. She was placed in isolation given hx
untreated LTBI and findings on CTA concerning for tuberculosis.
Infectious disease was consulted who recommended stopping
levaquin because of possible effect on AFB smears, ruling out
for TB and starting bactrim for possible PCP [**
