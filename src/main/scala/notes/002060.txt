Pertinent Results:
head CT [**9-17**]:
1. Extensive intracranial injury including right frontal and
parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage, frontal contusions, small
subdural collections and scattered foci of increased attenuation
at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction concerning for diffuse axonal
injury.
Further characterization with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] echo sequences may
be helpful for further characterization.
2. Incompletely imaged facial bone fractures as above for which
a
maxillofacial CT is recommended for further evaluation.
3. Metallic foreign body of unclear etiology in the region of
the
nasopharynx. Clinical correlation is recommended.

CT sinus [**9-17**]:
1. Multiple fractures of the left frontal and parietal bones.
Comminuted
fracture of the left orbital walls and comminuted fractures of
the left
maxillary sinus walls.
2. Comminuted fracture of the left parasymphyseal region of the
mandible as well as fractures of the alveolar ridge of the
central-to-right body of the mandible as well as the left
maxillary alveolar ridge.
3. Additional fractures of the anterior wall of the right
maxillary sinus and the pterygoid plates bilaterally. Fracture
of the left hard palate and right nasal bone.
4. Comminuted fracture of the right lamina of C2 and the left
pedicle and
body of C2. Please refer to concurrent CT of the cervical spine
for
additional findings.
5. Tiny left subdural hematoma and right subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Please
refer to the concurrent CT of the head as well as head MR for
additional
significant findings.

MR head [**9-17**]:
1. Multiple small areas of slow diffusion in teh cortex
suspicious for
contusions, although embolic infarction could present a similar
appearance.
2. Enlarged extra- axial CSF space over the frontal and temporal
lobes
bilaterally, which may represent with intensity slightly greater
than CSF.
These likely represent subdural hygromas. No significant change
in size of a thin T2 hyperintense extra- axial hemorrhage over
the left frontal, temporal and parietal lobes.
3. Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages.

C-spine CT [**9-17**]
The skull base through the superior endplate of T2 is well
visualized on the lateral view. An endotracheal tube is noted in
place.
Multiple fractures are identified. There is a comminuted
fracture of the C2 left body lamina junction which extends to
the vertebral foramen. A
comminuted fracture of the right C2 lamina is seen extending
into the pars
inferior facet. There is clockwise rotation of C2 in relation
with the C1
vertebral body. The right inferior articulating facet of C2
appears subluxed lying anterior to the inferior facet of C3.

Additional fractures include a comminuted C5 spinous process
fracture, a
comminuted fracture of the C6 spinous process extending slightly
into the
bilateral laminae, a distracted fracture of the C7 pedicle and a
nondisplaced fracture of the right C7 lamina. Nondisplaced
fractures are also noted involving the anteroinferior C7 and
anterosuperior T1 vertebral bodies. There is a unilateral
"jumped" left facet, C6 on C7. CT does not provide intrathecal
detail comparable to MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] material within the spinal
canal at C6-C7 likely compresses the cord and may represent
hematoma or disk material. Bullous changes are present at the
lung apices. A metallic foreign body is noted in the nasopharynx
of unclear origin. Please refer to the accompanying CT facial
bone regarding numerous skull fractures.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] [**9-17**]
1. Edema and/or contusion of the cervical cord at the C2/3
level.
2. T2 and STIR hyperintensity of the disc at the C2/3 level with
disruption
of the disc margin posteriorly. Similar findings at the C7/T1
level.
3. Disruption of the ligamentum flavum at the C6/7 level.
4. Edema and/or hemorrhage of the interspinous ligaments
extending from C3
through T1.
5. Left C6/7 unilateral interfacet dislocation and right C2/3
and left C7/T1 facet joint disruption.
6. For full description of the cervical spinal fractures, please
refer to the concurrent CT of the cervical spine.
7. No large epidural hematomas. No cord compression.
8. Prevertebral hematoma suspicious for anterior longitudinal
ligament injury.

CT C/A/P [**9-17**]
1. Focal irregularity of the intima in the descending aorta
concerning for
minimal aortic injury. As the location is not classic
differential diagnosis includes atherosclerotic plaques,
although this is considered less likely. Follow-up CT in 24
hours is recommended to ensure stability.
2. No mediastinal hematoma.
3. Patchy airspace opacity likely representing pulmonary
contusion with
aspiration in the right mid lower lobes. Dense consolidation at
the lung
bases, greater than left, may represent atelectasis versus
effusion.
4. Fractures of the fourth and fifth ribs with tiny amount of
subpleural air.
5. Fractures of the lumbar spine as described above.
6. Thickening of the bladder wall extending into the distal left
ureter with proximal dilatation of the ureter. The constellation
of findings is
comcerning for transitional cell carcinoma and atypical for
traumatic
injury. Follow- up CT with delayed images of the ureter and a
filled bladder are recommended for better delineation of the
process.
ADDENDUM: Upon further review, it was noted that the patient had
a
nondisplaced fracture of the medial right scapula. Findings were
discussed
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2120-9-18**].

L femur XR/L tib fib XR [**9-17**]: Minimally displaced fracture
through the distal fibula. Soft tissue defect anterior to the
tibia containing
