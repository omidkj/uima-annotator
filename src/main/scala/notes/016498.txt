History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 72 year old male with history of orpharyngeal
cancer status post radiation 13 years ago, PEG tube in [**2195**] to
diminish recurrence of aspiration pneumonia and three recent
admissions over past two months for aspiration pneumona, acute
kidney injury and ICU admission once which led to rehab at
Woodbriar and then home on [**2200-5-17**].

Over the past week, he was readmitted to [**Hospital3 **] for
hypotension from [**6-4**] - [**6-8**] thought to be due to adrenal
insufficiency treated with prednisone 100 mg daily and then was
readmitted from [**6-9**] - [**6-11**] for steroid induced altered mental
status.

Over the past couple of days, he has had labile hypertension and
hypotension documented by his wife at home and by [**Name (NI) 269**] which led
to his presentation to ED today.

In the ED, initial vs were 98.3 195/98 68 22 100%RA.  He was
given levaquin in the ED for CXR concerning for LLL pneumonia.
His labs were notable for leukocytosis of 19.2, sodium of 129,
potassium of 5.3 and creatinine of 1.7.  He was admitted to
medicine service for further evaluation and management of his
pneumonia and laboratory abnormalities along with BP management.

On the floor, he reported no complaints.

CXR [**6-15**]
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were performed.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left base
opacity is is best appreciated on the frontal view.  The
mediastinum is unremarkable.  The cardiac silhouette is top
normal.

IMPRESSION:  Possible left lower lobe pneumonia.  Follow up
after treatment is recommended to evaluate resolution.

RENAL US
IMPRESSION:
1.  Normal kidneys bilaterally.  No evidence of renal artery
stenosis

ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal biventricular cavity sizes and preserved regional with
excellent global biventricular systolic function. No valvular
pathology or pathologic flow identified.
