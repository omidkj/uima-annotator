Date of Birth:  [**2074-9-9**]             Sex:   F

Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Latex / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright Red Blood Per Rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory Lapartomy, Sigmoid Colectomy, Takedown of
Splenic Flexure and Colovaginal Fistula, Cystoscopy


History of Present Illness:
82YO P2 with hx stage 1a endometrial cancer s/p TAH/BSO/PNLD
[**2156-6-3**] and subsequent [**Last Name (un) **]-vaginal fistula formation
(conservatively managed, still present on most recent clinic
visit [**11/2156**]) - presented to ED with passage of red clots per
rectum [**3-6**] afternoon.

She was in her usual state of health, without any passage of
stool per vagina for the last 2 months and with regular daily
bowel movements, when she felt like passing gas the morning of
presentation.  She discovered that she had actually passed
multiple blood clots (the largest of which was half-dollar
sized).  This happened 3-4 times.  No active bleeding noticed.
She did not soak any pads but used [**2-22**] Depends undergarments for
the 9 hours prior to presentation (changed for hygeine).  She is
confident that blood clots were
from rectum and not from the vagina.

She did have a known rectal adenomatous polyp. Her medical
history was unchanged from baseline other than increased use of
Alleve for pain.

In the ED she was noted to have a small amount of stool in the
vaginal vault that was dark with appearance consistent with
blood. She was seen by colorectal surgery and admitted to the
GYN/ONC team for further inpatient monitoring.

IMAGING:
[**3-7**] CT A/P: 1. In this patient with known history of
endometrial carcinoma, there is no evidence of recurrent or
metastatic disease.
2. Short segment thickening of loop of sigmoid colon, similar in
morphology
to the prior study. These findings could represent sequelae of
chronic
diverticulitis or post surgical scarring, however, an underlying
mass lesion cannot be excluded. Recommended further evaluation
with colonoscopy versus CT colonography.
3. No evidence of a rectovaginal fistula.
4. Small incisional hernia.
5. Hepatic steatosis.

[**2157-3-10**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.5 cm
above the carina. There is no nasogastric tube and no other
monitoring or support devices.  Unchanged borderline size of the
cardiac silhouette, newly appeared minimal blunting of the left
costophrenic sinus, potentially suggesting presence of a minimal
pleural effusion. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with
crowding of the right basal pulmonary vessels. No evidence of
pneumonia. No pneumothorax.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) Study Date of [**2157-3-12**] 9:18 AM
Unremarkable bowel gas pattern.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 86131**] was admitted to the GYN/ONC service for close
observation. Colorectal surgery followed. She was kept NPO and
typed and crossed for two units of packed red blood cells. Her
Hct on admission to the ED was 38; on transfer to the floor, it
was found to be 30. Her vital signs remained stable. She was
followed closely and her Hct remained stable throughout [**3-7**].
Gastroenterology was consulted. The morning of [**3-8**] she was
found to have a Hct of 26.8. Gastroenterology recommended that
she undergo EGD and Colonoscopy. She drank ~3 L of MoviPrep
prior to this procedure on [**3-9**] am.

Prior to the EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] the patient was noted to have large
clotted BM. The EGD was normal. Colonoscopy was able to
visualize up to 30cm, however they couldn't pass scope further
than this. There was a likely stricture vs area of ischmeic
colitis vs diverticulitis vs diverticular bleed at the 30 cm
mark, thought to be the site of the bright red blood per rectum,
however given unable to pass scope farther, not able to be
certain. During the procedure, the patient's BP dropped to 50/30
transiently when rolling from supine to left lateral. She was
repositioned, given dose of phenylephrine without response, then
given repeat phenylephrine, IV fluids, and ephedrine. The
procedure was stopped. She was taken to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with stable VS
for close monitoring.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she had a distended abdomen. A stat KUB showed free
air in the abdomen and so she was presumed to have
peri-procedure perforation and was taken back to the OR for
colectomy with diverting colostomy. After the OR, she received
albumin, crystalloid and 2 U of packed red blood cells. She was
treated with Meropenem, Vancomycin, Flagyl and Fluconazole. She
was easily extubated. She continued to have good urine output
after her procedure. HCT Stable, with white count increasing on
discharge from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], lactate tending up to 2.3. Pain under
control with morphine. Currently on IV beta-blockade, with plan
to switch to home regimen w
