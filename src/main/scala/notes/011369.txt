Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
weight gain, shortness of breath, volume overload

Right sided CVL
CVVH via femoral line

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo M with Ischemic cardiomyopathy EF < 20%,
s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD recently discharged on [**8-2**] for CHF
admitted with another acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.  During
his recent last hospitalization, we were able to remove several
liters of volume but diuresis was limited by advancing azotemia
and low blood pressure.  He was discharged from the hospital
after a minimal diuresis.  However, he claims to have felt less
bloated and less dyspneic after his treatment.  He states that
he was doing well after discharge until the last 48-72 hours
when he started gaining weight again and having increased
shortness of breath.  He reports gaining 6 pounds over the last
2 days and reports an increase in abdominal girth/firmness.  His
weight is 224 pounds currently with a dry weight on discharge
[**8-2**] of 216 pounds. He did not take any extra doses of Lasix at
home for this weight gain.  His shortness of breath at rest also
increased over this same time period.  He feels increased
dyspnea on exertion as well and as a result feels too weak to
walk.  He has been making a great effort to reduce the caloric
and sodium content in his diet and has come up with an elaborate
chart to document his intake.  His goal intake is 1200 mg or
less of sodium and fewer calories per day.  He continues to use
his BiPAP mask at night.  Otherwise he denies fevers, chills,
chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, hematochezia, melena. He does report recent onset
of unsteady gait.
.
He was a direct admit from home and thus not seen in the ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo M with Ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, s/p
CABG x 2, s/p BIV ICD recently discharged on [**8-2**] for CHF,
directly admitted from home with an acute on chronic CHF
exacerbation for aggressive diuresis.
.
# PUMP: Patient has history of acute on chronic systolic heart
failure [**1-25**] ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He is s/p mitral
valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function since.
Now coming in approximately [**10-7**] kg above his dry weight. In
the CCU, patient was continued on lasix bolus and gtt, along
with milrinone bolus and gtt.  He was continued on metolazone 5
mg [**Hospital1 **].  CVVH was started via R femoral line and continued for
several days until it clotted off.  Through this time, patient
was continued on low dose neosynephrine as needed to support
blood pressure with goal MAP of 55.  When CVVH line clotted off
([**2179-8-17**]), patient was re-initiated on lasix gtt and metolazone
with good UOP of 100-200 cc/hr.  Patient was net -15 L fluid
removal on discharge.  Patient was continued on BB to prevent
ectopy. EP was contact[**Name (NI) **] about the possibility of LV pacing, as
patient has severe LV/RV dysynchrony on echo. It was felt that
given his NYHA class IV status as well as prior use of LV pacing
which was not very successful, the risks outweighed the
benefits.  However, patient's pacemaker HR was increased to 90
to improve forward flow.  Patient approached new dry weight of
110kg (came in at 121 kg). His K+ goal was kept near 5-5.5 with
aggressive supplementation.  On discharge, patient told to stop
his lasix (160 mg [**Hospital1 **]) and carvedilol (25 mg [**Hospital1 **]).  Instead, he
will take torsemide (80 mg [**Hospital1 **]) and metoprolol succinate (50 mg
daily in AM). He was also discharged on potassium supplements 40
meq tid.  Patient was informed to check his weights on a daily
basis, nutrition care was discussed with patient as well.  If
patient starts gaining weight (i.e. [**1-26**] lbs), he is to take
metolazone 5 mg tablet and call [**Hospital 1902**] clinic.  He has f/u with
[**Doctor First Name **] on [**2179-9-1**] in [**Hospital 1902**] clinic.

# CORONARIES: Extensive history of CAD s/p CABG x 2, last cath
in [**2176**] with LIMA widely patent, SVG to OM with proximal 30%
stenosis, SVG jump graft to D1 and distal diag patent. No acute
issues.  Patient was continued on asa 81, lipitor 20.  No ACEi
given acute on chronic renal failure.
