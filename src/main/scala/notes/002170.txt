Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**2168-8-16**], underwent excisional wound debridement at
bedside, started on IV Vancomycin, and po Levofloxacin.  Had
remained hemodynamically stable, progressing with wound care and
antibiotics, being diuresed. On [**2168-8-21**], he had a cardiac
arrest, exhibited by bradycardia progressing rapidly to
asystole.  ACLS protocol was initiated, he was intubated, and
transferred to the ICU.  He did not wake up appropriately
post-code, and a neurology consult was called.  It was felt that
he's suffered a significant CVA during the time of his arrest.
He remained fully ventilated, and hemodynamically stable over
the next few days, but showed no signs of neurologic
improvement.  The neurology service believed that he was at best
to remain in a chronic vegetative state.  This was discussed
with patient's wife (and other family members).  They initially
wanted to give him some more time, an dnot withdraw support.
But, as no neurologic improvement was seen, on [**9-3**],
the patient's wife requested that his ventilator support and
endotracheal tube be discontinued, and that no resuscitative
measures be instituted.  He was extubated at 1600, and became
apneic a few hours later.  He expired at 2055.
