History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20899**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with PMH significant for DM,
BPH s/p TURP, and remote low grade TCC s/p resection, who
presents with a chief complaint of gross hematuria. He had
previously been in his USOH until he began to have blood in his
urine last night. He denies dysuria, changes in frequency of
urination, difficulty voiding, pain with voiding, or abdominal
pain. He had a urinary tract infection several months ago which
presented with hematuria. He denies any fevers, chills,
abdominal pain.
.
In the ED, the patient had a urinalysis, which showed trace
leukocytes, large blood, and few bacteria. He was also found to
have a white count of 13.4. He received 1 gram ceftriaxone IV.
Urology was consulted.
.
Hospital course: Patient was seen and examined by the [**Doctor Last Name **]
medicine team. At approximately 1:00 AM, the team was called to
the room for a "code blue." The patient had been sitting on the
side of the bed to have a bowel movement and apparently
collapsed in the son's arms. The code team arrived, and found
the patient awake. Vital signs were immediately taken, pacer
pads were placed on the patient's chest, and a nasal cannula was
placed on the patient's nose. A BP was not able to be obtained
initially, but he had 2+ bilateral pedal pulses. The patient was
oriented to self, and responding appropriately. Fingerstick
glucose was measured to be 117. Repeat Hct had just returned at
35, which was a 3 point Hct drop from the ER. A fluid bolus of
500 cc NS was given. The decision was made with the MICU team to
get an EKG, which did not show new ST changes compared with an
old EKG. The attending was called, and the decision was made to
keep the patient on the floor on telemetry.

Studies:

[**1-15**] CXR (AP): No appreciable change. Mild blunting of bilateral
costophrenic angles.

[**1-17**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. Filling defect within the bladder may represent clot or
recurrence of transitional cell carcinoma. Direct visualization
is recommended.
2. Mild aspiration pneumonia.

diverticulitis.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
5. Extensive degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine.
.
[**1-18**] Video Oropharyngeal swallow:
Fluoroscopic assistance was provided for the speech and
swallowing division. There is poor epiglottic deflection and no
laryngeal elevation. Penetration was seen both before and during
administration of nectar thick liquids. There was premature
spillover during the oral phase due to loss of bolus control and
swallowing delay. Microaspiration was seen with all
consistencies.
IMPRESSION: Multiple episodes of penetration with several
episodes of microaspiration with all consistencies of barium.
.
[**1-20**] Bladder biopsy pathology:
1.  Low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, no lamina propria
invasion seen.
2.  Muscularis propria present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief hospital course by problem:
.
## Hemorrhagic cystitis: The patient was admitted with hematuria
and continued to have significant hematuria during most of the
admission. He was evaluated by urology and maintained on
continuous bladder irrigation. She was manually bladder
irrigated by urology and approximately 2 units of clot were
removed. He required a total of 6 units RBC transfusion. In the
past, he has had admissions for UTI, usually presenting with
hematuria. Given this history, he was treated with a 7 day
course of ceftriaxone for empiric UTI coverage, though his urine
culture was negative. CT urogram was concerning for possible
recurrence of TCC (showed filling defect in the bladder). He
underwent cystoscopy on [**1-20**], which revealed recurrent TCC. The
tumor was resected and fulgurated under spinal block anesthesia.
After the procedure, his urine cleared. CBI and his foley were
discontinued. He received a 3 day course of ciprofloxacin, per
usual post-cystoscopy regimen. On discharge, his urine was clear
and without clots. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] urology as
an outpatient.
.
# Troponinemia/CAD: He had a troponin leak in the ICU with peak
of 0.21. Troponin increased again on the floor with peak of
0.61. This likely represented demand ischemia in the setting of
vasovagal syncope (during BM), UTI, and anemia secondary to
acute blood loss from hematuria. He had no new EKG changes. He
did have one episode of chest pain prior to the initial troponin
leak, however this was felt unlikely to be ACS given transient
nature and no EKG changes. He was evaluated by the cardiology
service who recomended optimal medical management as he was not
a candidate for intervention. He was treated with aspirin,
statin, beta blocker, [**Last Name (un) **], and intermittent lasix. His
outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was made aware of these
events.
.
## Hypotension: He had several episodes of transient hypotension
during this admission. The first resulted in a code blue (as
above) when he became hypotensive to the 60s and unresponsive
while on the commode; likely a vasovagal episode. His SBP came
back up to normal range without intervention. Later, he again
became hypotensive to the 60s 1-2 hours after manual bladder
irrigation. Given the hypotension and his leukocytosis there was
concern for developing urosepsis and he was transferred to the
MICU. He was given IVF and his BP came back to the normal range.
He was transferred back to the medical floor the next day. He
had one further episode of hypotension, again with SBP
transiently to the 60s 2 hours after manual bladder irrigation.
He was given a 250cc bolus of NS and his BP responded
appropriately. These episodes were most likely related to blood
loss from his bladder vs vasovagal response to the fluid shifts
with bladder irrigation. On discharge he was hemodynamically
stable. Urine and blood cultures were all negative making
urosepsis less likely.
.
## Cough/Wheeze/Hypoxia: The patient became wheezy at times with
productive cough and intermittent transient hypoxia. This was
most likely related to mucous plugging vs mild CHF. He would
occasionally desaturat
