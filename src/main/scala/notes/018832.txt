showed an EF of 70% and he was taken to the catheterization
laboratory which showed severe three vessel disease.  He was
then taken to the Operating Room on [**2165-7-30**] for an
emergent coronary artery bypass operation.  This was a three
vessel CABG redo with vein graft to LAD, ramus, and PDA.  The
pump time was 73 minutes and cross clamp time was 62 minutes
and he tolerated the procedure well.  He was transferred to
the CSRU in stable condition, intubated.

In the CSRU, he did well and essentially started to be
diuresed and was put on Lopressor for blood pressure control.
He was successfully transferred to the floor on [**2165-8-2**].  His recovery course was essentially unremarkable.  The
blood pressure was well controlled.  His blood sugar was also
well controlled.

He was seen by Physical Therapy who cleared him for level V
activity and he is discharged to home on [**2165-8-4**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient was instructed to restart
his home medication except Persantine and Plavix.  The blood
pressure control has been effective with his home
medications, antihypertensive medication regimen, and Lasix

given to him at the time of discharge and also Dilaudid for
pain medication, and Colace for constipation as needed.
