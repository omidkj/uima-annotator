Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old gentleman who was admitted to the acute care service
after his bicylce struck a pot-hole and he went over the
handlebars.  Upon admission, he was hypotensive requiring fluid
resusitation and there was a concern for a retroperitoneal bleed
and for this reason he underwent an abdominal cat scan which did
not show a retroperitoneal bleed.  He was found to have a right
thigh hematoma and was evaluated in interventional radiology and
no active bleeding identified.  He was evaluated by the
Orthopedic service for his clavicle and pelvic fracture.  His
injuries were determined to be non-operative and recommendations
for mobility addressed.  Because of his large fluid requirement,
he was admitted to the intensive care unit for further
monitoring. His hematocrit remained stable.  He was started no a
regular diet on HOD #2.  His foley catheter was discontinued on
HOD #2.  He has been voiding without difficulty.  His vital
signs are stable and he is afebrile.  He is preparing for
discharge home with follow-up in the [**Hospital **] clinic and with
the acute care service.
