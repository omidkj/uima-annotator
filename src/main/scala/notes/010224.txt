CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: OB with ? Pneumo and hx of COPD- eval for PE vs
Pneumothorax
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
46 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
OB with ? Pneumo and hx of COPD- eval for PE vs Pneumothorax
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Question pneumonia, history of COPD; evaluate for
pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest was performed before and after the
administration of IV contrast using the CT pulmonary angiography
protocol. 100 cc of Optiray nonionic contrast was given for this
examination. Nonionic contrast was given for the rapid bolus
required for CT pulmonary angiography.

COMPARISON: [**2103-3-9**].

FINDINGS:

CTA: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH WITHOUT/WITH CONTRAST: The patient is
intubated. There is bibasilar atelectasis at the dependent
portions of both lungs. There is no evidence of consolidation or
pleural effusion.

Lymph nodes at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged are
present at the AP window and right paratracheal regions. The
heart and pericardium appear within normal limits. The pulmonary
artery trunk is somewhat enlarged, measuring 3.2 cm, suggestive
of pulmonary artery hypertension.

Visualized portions of the upper abdominal structures are
unremarkable, and osseous structures also appear within normal
limits.

Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were also reviewed,
demonstrating no significant abnormalities aside from
atelectasis described above.

IMPRESSION
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Enlarged pulmonary artery trunk suggestive of PA
hypertension.
4. Mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -76 BY SAME PHYSICIAN

Reason: POST INTUBATION

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
46 year old woman with severe asthma, diastolic CHF, and severe
tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia now in ED with chest pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
POST INTUBATION
INDICATION: Severe asthma with chest pain. Post intubation.

COMPARISON: Earlier, same day.

FINDINGS: ET tube tip is well positioned approximately 2 cm
above the carina. The heart size and mediastinal contours are
normal. There is minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. Lung
volumes are slightly low. There has been no significant change
in the appearance of the chest since the earlier exam.

IMPRESSION: ET tube in good position.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure: The patient has known tracheal stenosis
and severe asthma. However, it was unclear what caused her to
have such a precipitious decline in respuratoy function. PE and
pneumonia were ruled out. She was intubated in the ED after her
PCO2 was 99 and then rapidly extubated on [**3-24**]. She was
emperically treated with steroids, levofloxacin, and nebulizers.
She continued to use BIPAP at night and her baseline 3L O2
during the day once she was on the floor.

# Tracheomalacia: The patient had previously refused treatement
for this in [**2103-2-17**].

# DM: The patient was maintianed on her home regmin of insulin
once on the floor.

# Schizophrenia: The paitent was ready to be discharged when she
then expressed sucidial ideation - specifically of cutting her
wrists. Initially she could not contract for safety. Psych was
called for an urgent consult and felt that she was safe to be
discharged home with close follow up.
