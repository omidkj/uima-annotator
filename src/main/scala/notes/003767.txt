Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2193-4-24**] and taken to the Operating [**2193-4-27**] for T9-L5
laminectomy for congenital stenosis. Please refer to the
dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was
without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU
in a stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for
postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were
given per standard protocol.
Post-op his motor exam showed no movement or sensation of his
lower extremities.  He was administered a stat MRI of the
cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine to assess for cord
compression.  A cord signal change was identified at T10.  He
was transfered to the SICU and a neurology consult was obtained
and recommendations followed.  An infarct to the anterior spinal
cord was thought to have occurred.  He was placed on solumedrol
for 24 hours with mild improvement in hip internal rotation.
Sensation improved.
An additional MRI was obtained which showed a post-operative
hematoma at the surgiclal site and this was aspirated under CT
guidance.
He was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was
advanced as tolerated.
He developed a fever and increasing white count and was placed
on antibiotics for a presumed pneumonia.  He was screened for
rehab and will follow up in the Orthopaedic Spine clinic in two
weeks.
