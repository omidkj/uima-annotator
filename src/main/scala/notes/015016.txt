History of Present Illness:
38 year old male with a longstanding history of cirrhosis due to

hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] for vomiting of bright red blood.  Patient was
lavaged in the [**Hospital1 1562**] ED which returned over two liters of red
blood.  He was then taken for emergent EGD and found to be
bleeding from the gastric cardia that was not responsive to
hemoclipping or sclerotherapy.  The site was believed to be a
bleeding varix.  Patient was then air lifted to [**Hospital1 18**] having
received 11 units of PRBCs and 2 units of FFP prior to arrival.
He was given octreotide, versed and fentanyl prior to arrival.

Pertinent Results:
TIPS [**2134-4-9**] 8:48 PM
1. Successful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
using 10 mm by 94 mm bare metal wall stent extending from the
main right portal vein to the distal right hepatic vein, with no
residual portosystemic gradient seen at the end of the
procedure.
2. Embolization of large coronary vein varix with alcohol with
good venographic result.
3. Placement of a 9 French triple lumen venous access catheter
in the right internal jugular vein with tip in the superior vena
cava, ready for use.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2134-4-10**] 11:26 AM
1) Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall color flow in the appropriate
direction. There is appropriate reversal of flow within the left
portal vein, consistent with a patent TIPS.
2) Sludge within the gallbladder and within the common duct. The
common duct is slightly dilated at its mid portion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61109**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2134-4-9**] as a direct
transfer from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for an acute upper GI bleed and
hemodynamic lability.  Upon arrival, he underwent an EGD which
showed active bleeding from a gastric varix in the fundus and
portal gastropathy but no esophageal varices.  Later that
evening, he underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt (TIPS) procedure with good results and having tolerated
the procedure well. His recovery process was challenging due to
his overall ill health. He remained in the SICU for several days
and was gradually improving. He was transferred to the floor
after his neurologic and hemodynamic status improved. On the
floor he was continued on total parenteral nutrition through his
subclavian line, and a Hepatamine mixture was used for protein
to facilitate liver recovery. As his status improved, he was
able to tolerate food by mouth. As his oral intake improved, his
TPN was reduced and eventually stopped. Although initially quite
disoriented, Mr [**Known lastname 61109**] improved greatly and was alert and
oriented x3 at all times. His ability to handle his activities
of daily living was of great concern, and he was seen often by
physical and occupational therapy, who eventually got him back
to an acceptable baseline function.

Of note, near the end of his hospital course his bilirubin was
noted to be rising, as noted in pertinent results. Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] of the hepatology service are following this patient
closely, and wish to see him in follow up to ensure a good
recovery of his profoundly damaged liver.
