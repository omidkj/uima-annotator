Pertinent Results:
Cath [**6-23**]: 1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Critical
aortic stenosis. 3. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Carotid U/S [**6-24**]:  Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis
Echo [**6-24**]: There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal(LVEF>55%). There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The jet is central. Post
Bypass: Biventricular systolic function is preserved.
Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. Valve appears
well seated and the leaflets move well. Trace aortic
insufficiency present. Peak velocity at the level of the aortic
valve was 1.7 m/sec. The mitral regurgitation is now 1+ which is
significantly improved from pre bypass findings.
CXR [**6-29**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac cath on [**6-23**] which revealed severe
AS and 2vd. She remained in the hospital and after pre-operative
work-up and consent, she was brought to the operating room on
[**6-24**]. She [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a aortic valve replacement and coronary
artery bypass graft x 2. Please see operative report for
surgical details. She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Later on op day she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. She
did experience some post-op delirium which resolved with time
and elimination of narcotics and further sedatives. Intermittent
Haldol was required as was a patient observer to avoid self
harm. She was started on Amiodarone for episodes of paroxsymal
atrial fibrillation amd also given units of packed red blood
cells to maintain hematocrit and optimize hemodynamics. Once her
neurologic and hemodynamics stablized, she transferred to the
SDU on postoperative day four. Over the next several days, her
postop delirium completely resolved. Beta blockade was slowly
advanced as tolerated while Amiodarone was continued. She
maintained a normal sinus rhythm as no further episodes of PAF
were noted. Overall, she continued to make clinical improvements
with diuresis and mad steady progress with phsyical therapy. She
was medically cleared for discharge on postoperative day seven.
