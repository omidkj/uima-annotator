Brief Hospital Course:
He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**6-6**], was seen by
cardiac surgery and had theusual preoperative workup including
PFT's and dental clearance.
On [**6-7**] he was brought to the Operating Room where mitral valve
repair with a 28-mm annuloplasty CG Future ring and coronary
artery bypass grafting x 1 with reverse saphenous vein graft to
the posterior descending artery were performed. He tolerated the
operation well and was transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU in
stable condition. He was stable in the immediate post-operative
period, anesthesia was reversed and he woke neurologically
intact and was extubated. He continued to do well and was
transferred to the cardiac surgery stepdown floor on POD2. All
tubes lines and drains were removed per cardiac surgery
protocol.

On POD3 his lab work revealed an elevated Creatinine and
platelet count down to 34K. All nephrotoxic meds were stopped
and urine electrolytes were checked and  his creatinine
gradually returned to [**Location 213**]. A HIT screen was checked and was
negative. Over the next several days he had increasing abdominal
distention with tenderness and nausea, LFTs/amylase and lipase
were checked and found to be elevated as was the WBC. He was
made NPO, an Abdominal CT was done, General Surgery was
consulted. On [**6-14**] he returned to the Operating Room with Dr
[**First Name (STitle) **] for an exploratory laparoscopy that was essentially
negative. His abdominal exam gradually improved and over several
days his diet was advanced. All lab values trended back toward
normal. The remainder of his hospital stay was uneventful. His
activity was advanced with the assistance of Physical Therapy
and nursing staff.

Coumadin was resumed for his chronic atrial fibrillation. he was
tolerating a heart healthy diet at discharge and his exam was
benign. Diuretics were continued after discharge as he remained
8kgs above his preoperative weight.

On POD 14 he was discharged home with visiting nurses. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 66039**]) will follow his INR and adjust Coumadin
dosing upon discharge.
