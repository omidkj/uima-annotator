Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
(Note: patient had right sided chest tube removed that had been
placed at outside hospital)

History of Present Illness:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old male with past medical
history significant for COPD on home O2, HTN, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, (not on coumadin; compliance issues), diastolic
CHF, and OA who presented initially to OSH at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] on
[**1-14**] with worse shortness of breath from baseline, poor PO
intake. Notable leukocytosis to 22k range and concern for
underlying PNA. Additional imaging with chest CT revealed
loculated right pleural effusion with pleural thickening
suggestive of an empyema as well as smaller left sided effusion.
Zosyn was initiated on [**1-20**] and chest tube was placed at OSH
with failure to obtain any pleural fluid. Outside hospital labs
were significant for leukocytosis 22.2 ([**1-19**]: 10.7); HCT 43;
Na: 135; Co2: 32.7; Creatinine 1.7 (prior 0.9); U tox negative.

.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] SICU for additional thoracics
evaluation for potential VATS/pigtail placement vs.
decortication but thoracics team did not feel imaging or
clinical picture suggestive of true empyema and feels this is a
chronic effusion that does not need to be drained. SICU vitals
on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] on [**1-20**] were:  HR 93, BP 107/55, RR
24 and O2 sat 97% 3L. Thoracic service had chest tube removed
[**1-21**], this morning. Per SICU team, patient's leukocytosis felt
to be secondary to possible PNA vs. UTI given that recent urine
studies  growing coag negative staph. Patient was started on
Vanco/Zosyn at [**Location (un) 620**] which was continued here over past day.
.
In addition, at OSH patient went into afib with RVR to 120s and
was managed on a combination of digoxin and diltiazem gtt prior
to transitioning back to oral beta blocker therapy with fair
resolution and HR control (HRs 70-80s).
.
Also developed ARF over last week as his creatinine on admission
to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] was 0.8 on [**1-14**] and now up to low 2 range. He had
exposure to contrast for CT imaging studies and he was also
given lasix for question of CHF exacerbation at OSH which may
have been contributing factors. Lasix held here since admission.

.
Lower extremity doppler done here after transfer for mild LE
edema and picked up a right LE DVT with thrombus within the
right superficial femoral vein and within the right popliteal
vein. At time of transfer now patient has yet to be started on
anticoagulation for DVT.
.
Lastly, patient also complained of some vague abdominal pains
and per reports he had question of obstruction at OSH so KUB
performed with with nonspecific bowel gas pattern. Here in SICU
patient has had healthy bowel sounds but mild LLQ tenderness. No
BM since transferred at 10pm last night, no nausea, no vomiting.
Of note, history of diverticulosis.
.

At time of transfer to general medicine service on [**1-21**] patient
appeared to be in no apparent distress but seems confused which
is near typical baseline per family. Vitals signs at time of
transfer: T98.3, BP 110/67, HR 89, RR 16 and 02 Saturation 97%
3L.

.

chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies
headaches.

IMAGING:
.
[**1-22**] CXR:
The examination is compared to [**2102-1-21**]. In the
interval, the
patient has received a right-sided PICC line. The tip of the
line projects
over the lower SVC. There is no evidence of complications,
notably no
pneumothorax.
Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.

[**1-21**] CXR - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
the right-sided chest tube  has been removed. Minimal right
pleural thickening, minimal left pleural effusion. No evidence
of pneumothorax.
.
[**1-20**] CXR - FINDINGS: Small lung volumes. Borderline size of the
cardiac silhouette, small left pleural effusion, small platelike
right atelectasis. On the right, the patient has a chest tube.
The sidehole of the tube is outside the pleural cavity and
projects over the soft tissues. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax.
.
[**1-20**] RLE Ultrasound:
Thrombus within the right superficial femoral vein, with total
occlusion seen in the mid portion and partial occlusion seen in
the proximal portion. The distal portion is patent. Patent right
common femoral vein, which contains a catheter. Small isolated
nonocclusive thrombus within the right popliteal vein.
Non-compressible thrombus demonstrated in at least one right
deep calf vein. No DVT detected within the left lower extremity.
The left peroneal veins were not assessed as the patient refused
further evaluation. 6. 3.0 x 2.1 x 2.7 cm right groin hematoma,
without internal flow.
.
OUTSIDE HOSPITAL IMAGES:
[**1-19**]: Chest CT: MDCT of the chest was done with intravenous
infusion of 100 cc Omnipaque 300. Sagittal and coronal
reformatted images were obtained. There is a moderate posterior
right pleural effusion. Suggestion of thickening and enhancement
of the surrounding pleural surfaces. There is minimal swelling
of the overlying soft tissue as well. There is a
