HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical

involved in this patient on [**2195-11-5**], when we were asked to
see this man for distended, nontender abdomen.  The patient
on 12./20./01, underwent abdominal ultrasound which showed no
ascites.  It was noted that his abdominal distention was
increasing as was his white count and he underwent an
abdominal CT which revealed air in the portal system.

His examination at this time showed temperature 100.6 and
vital signs were otherwise stable.  He seemed somewhat
lethargic.  He had decreased breath sounds at the bilateral
bases.  His abdomen was significantly distended, tense,
diffusely tender and tympanitic.  He had voluntary guarding.
His rectal was stool guaiac positive.

Abdominal CT revealed air in the portal system including
bisuperior mesenteric vein branches.  The left and transverse
colon were dilated with a question of pneumatosis.

The patient was taken to the operating room for an emergent
exploratory laparotomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**].  Please see operative
note for details of the procedure.  Briefly, the patient
underwent a total colectomy and end ileostomy with a mucous
fistula.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was stable,
intubated to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.

His course in the Intensive Care Unit was [**Male First Name (un) 3928**].  He was
covered with broad spectrum antibiotics of Ceftriaxone and
Flagyl with spiking fevers with a significant requirement of
ventilatory support.  On [**2195-11-10**], the patient continued to
spike fevers.  His ventilatory support was weaned and the
patient was extubated.  He remains on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl.

Over the ensuing days, the patient did extremely well.  His
bowel function slowly returned and on [**2195-11-12**], he was
started on clear diet by mouth.  His diet was slowly
advanced.  He received parenteral nutritional support.  The
patient continued to have a significant intravenous fluid
requirement which kept him in the hospital.

On [**2195-11-21**], the patient was postoperative day sixteen and he
was comfortable. Temperature maximum was 98.6 and heart rate
was 76 with a blood pressure of 106/70.  He was breathing
comfortably at 22 times per minute and saturating 97% in room
air.  He took in 2270 p.o., 600 intravenous fluids, liter out
in urine and 30 liters out from the ileostomy.  The chest was
clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular was regular rate and
rhythm.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  The
extremities were warm and well perfused.

The patient was deemed doing extremely well and was
discharged to rehabilitation with the contingency that he
would be able to maintain hydration.
