Chief Complaint:
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  chest pain
REASON FOR CCU ADMISSION:  heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization [**2145-4-21**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7173**] is a 67y/o gentleman with HTN, HLD, DM2, prostate
cancer s/p XRT, bicuspid aorta with severe AS, and CAD s/p CABG
[**2135**] with known graft disease based on cardiac cath in [**2142**]
(patient declined redo sternotomy, AVR, and CABG at the time)
who presented with chest pain,underwent emergent cardiac cath
due to concern for STEMI, and was found to have unchanged
disease but is in heart failure. Pt initially presented to [**Hospital1 **]-N
by ambulance with c/o lightheadedness, and syncope while
climbing stairs. He felt normal prior to this and says his sx
only began with the syncopal episode that occurred on the
stairs. He had not had CP or SOB prior to the syncope. (Of note,
wife reports different story and states that he has had
increased SOB for past 2 days, increased LE edema, and unability
to sleep lying down due to SOB.) Ambulance called and EMT
reported pt to be diaphoretic on their arrival and slightly "out
of it." He also c/o nausea and vomiting at that time. An IV was
placed and fluids started and he improved. He was brought to
[**Hospital1 **]-N where he was c/o left arm pain which was dull and of
moderate intensity. An EKG showed SR and diffuse ST depressions
in nearly all leads (not including aVR and V1).  Given heparin,
zofran, and aspirin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At his baseline, he can walk about [**12-16**] mile before feeling short
of breath. He states that he has only had problems with DOE for
about 6 months now and it has been progressive. He does take
lasix at home and has had problems with [**Name2 (NI) **] and pulm edema in
past but they have been mild.  He was in this usual state of
health until 1 week ago when he presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] due to
dizziness/lightheadedness.  He was found to be relatively
hypotensive; it was determined that he was taking his
medications incorrectly (Lasix, Imdur, HCTZ).  He was told to
hold them, and then restart his Lasix a few days ago, which he
did. He subsequently developed the sx his wife described.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: Pulse: 106, RR: 24, BP: 120/70,
O2Sat: 100, O2Flow: cpap. Labs were notable for troponin 0.32,
BNP 2490, Cr 1.3 (baseline 0.7-0.8).  He underwent cardiac cath
due to concern for STEMI, and was found to have unchanged
disease compared to his prior cath in 11/[**2142**].  He was mildly
hypoxic so was started on BiPAP and was admitted to the CCU
team.
.
On arrival to the ICU, VS BP 107/64, P 98, RR 25, 99% CPAP. He
denies CP, N/V, but admits to continued SOB. No pain. Admits to
feeling diaphoretic.
.
ROS positive per HPI, otherwise negative.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2145-4-21**]:
[final report pending]

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7173**] is a 67y/o gentleman with HTN, HLD, DM2, prostate
cancer s/p XRT, bicuspid aorta with severe AS, and CAD s/p CABG
[**2135**] with known graft disease based on cardiac cath in [**2142**]
(patient declined redo sternotomy, AVR, and CABG at the time)
who presented with chest pain, underwent emergent cardiac cath
due to concern for STEMI, and was found to have unchanged
disease but was in clinical heart failure.

Over the course of the night, CCU team attempted diuresis with
Lasix 20g IV x1 (poor response) then started Lasix gtt at 5/hr
with urine output ~30-40/hr.    Blood pressures were systolic
~85 so he did not tolerate the Nitro gtt that was ordered.  We
placed him on CPAP.

At 6AM, team was paged that patient had requested to remove
CPAP.  He was oxygenating fine, but had HR 100-130 with SBP
~75-85.  He was mentating fine but endorsed diaphoresis and
nausea (vomited a few times).  No chest pain.  Began to feel ??????as
if I am drowning.??????

Team confirmed his code status:  under no circumstance would he
want chest compressions, or endotracheal intubation.  Even if
his immediate illness might be reversible.  CCU resident called
his wife [**Name (NI) **] and confirmed this with her; she knew he felt this
way and had written her a letter the day before mentioning that
he knew he was dying ?????? would not want resuscitation.

Cardiology Fellow was at the bedside at this time.  Team
attempted diuresis again with a Lasix drip but he became
persistently hypotensive and tachycardic.  Started Dopamine.
Continued to complain of dyspnea.  Team considered ACS (though
unlikely given his cath findings from hours earlier); though
possibly an element of ongoing ischemia as 2AM cardiac enzymes
were elevated.  Also considered PE.  TTE at the bedside did not
show any obvious signs of acute RV pressure/volume overload but
his LV appeared very hypokinetic.  Attending came to the bedside
and looked at TTE.  It was determined that he probably had acute
on chronic worsening LV failure.

After discussing the findings with patient and family, and
explaining that there were no measures available to reverse his
underlying disease, both patient and family understood and
requested that patient be transitioned to comfort-focused care.
 He had been back on CPAP at the time but requested for it to be
removed.  His dyspnea was treated with supplemental O2, fan by
the bedside, and morphine boluses.

Mr. [**Known lastname 7173**] had a bradycardic/PEA arrest and expired at 8:30AM,
with family (including [**Name (NI) **], wife/HCP) arriving soon thereafter.
[**Doctor First Name **] declined post-mortem exam.  Family was appreciative of
communication between team and family, as well as the treatment
of h
