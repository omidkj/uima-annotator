ECHO [**2116-3-24**]
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving phenylephrine. Regional and global left ventricular
systolic function are normal. No aortic dissection. No new
valvular abnormalities noted

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29239**] is a 66 M with history of severe coronary artery
disease who was admitted to the cardiology service on [**2116-3-22**]
with an episode of retrosternal burning. He was monitored on the
cardiology [**Hospital1 **] for 36 hrs without event, had no further
episodes of chest pain, ruled out by cardiac enzymes for
myocardial infarction. The cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical management and he was worked up in the
usual preoperative manner. On [**2116-3-24**], he was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. He later woke neurologically intact and was
extubated. His pressors were weaned.  On postoperative day one,
he was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
He was gently diuresed toward his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. His chest tubes and
epicardial wires were removed.  His beta blockade was increased
as tolerated. He was cleared for discharge to home with VNA
services on [**2116-3-28**].
