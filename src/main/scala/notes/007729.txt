History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old male with a history of
NASH/cryptogenic cirrhosis complicated by esophageal varices,
encephalopathy, SBP/ascites, and ?CHF/volume overload,
transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with GI bleeding
(coffee-ground emesis and BRBPR) with shock, acute renal
failure, hypoglycemia, and leukopenia with bandemia.   He has
been noncompliant with his prescribed lactulose and presented to
[**Hospital1 1562**] s/p fall and recurrent GI bleeding, initially refusing
EMS, who then returned to take him to the hospital once he
started having coffee-ground emesis.

He was admitted to [**Hospital1 1562**] back in [**2120-4-9**] with acute
encephalopathy in the setting of an E. coli UTI.  He was later
admitted at the beginning of [**2120-7-10**], received 6 units
pRBCs, 3 units platelets, and 2 units FFP for a presenting
hematocrit of 21.  EGD showed a large duodenal ulcer, grade 2
esophageal varices without bleeding stigmata, and no gastric
varices.  Evidence of portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Previously normal EGD 2 years prior.  H. pylori checked twice
and negative. His course was complicated by a CVA at rehab that
necessitated starting ASA prior to discharge home, confirmed by
CT and MRI.

Vital signs on arrival to the ED were: 134 90/47 24 92% on
dopamine, with decline in BPs to a nadir of 74/42.  He was
started on PPI and octreotide gtt's and CVL was obtained to
initiate pressors (norepinephrine and phenylephrine).  He was
also given 2 amps of D50 for a glucose of 19 on arrival.
Re-check FSBGs in low 200s.  He was intubated for airway
protection and eventual endoscopy.  Intubation was quite
difficult, as they ended up putting in a 6 tube and likely also
had aspiration.  He has received 6 units pRBC, 2 units FFP, and
2 units of platelets here at [**Hospital1 18**], after receiving 2 units
pRBCs at [**Hospital1 1562**].  Right pigtail placed from pneumothorax [**1-11**]
CVL.  OGT ouptut is black, about 500cc + melenotic stools.  Labs
were notable for a creatinine of 2.4 (baseline 1.2), AG of 15
(expected gap ~7 with albumin of 2.1), T. bili of 10.3, AST/ALT
133/64, WBC of 1.3 with 12% bands, Hct 33.8 (s/p pRBCs),
platelets of 49, INR of 2.3, and lactate of 9.1.   BP 93/43 and
satting 100% on AC at 100% FiO2.  [**Hospital1 1562**] also called back,
reporting [**2-11**] culture bottles growing GNRs. He is accompanied by
one of his daughters, who has been communicating with the rest
of the family.  He is currently full code and will come to the
ICU for endoscopic intervention.

On arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and sedated.  GI is
present in the MICU for endoscopy.

Blood cultures - NGTD

CXRs
[**8-22**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change.  Monitoring and support devices, and in particular the
right chest
tube, are constant.  There is no evidence of other changes.
Mild atelectasis
at the right lung base.  Mild persistent right apical
pneumothorax.  No overt
pulmonary edema but mild fluid overload is present.  Unchanged
size of the
cardiac silhouette.

[**8-21**]: Large right pneumothorax has increased in size.  Large
pneumoperitoneum which
may have been present earlier is much larger.

Progressive decrease in heart size attests to decreased right
ventricular
filling due to tension pneumothorax.  ET tube is in standard
placement.  Right
jugular line ends in the mid SVC.  Upper enteric tube ends in
the upper
stomach and could be advanced at least 5 cm to put all the side
ports beyond
the gastroesophageal junction.

[**8-20**]: Interval progression of the small right apical
pneumothorax. ETT ends 6 cm
above the trachea, within normal limits, but can be advanced by
2-3 cm for
ideal positioning. Moderate pulmonary edema and bilateral
pleural effusions,
also increased from the prior.  The right central line ends
unchanged in the
mid SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old male with decompensated cirrhosis presenting with
upper GI bleeding and Klebsiella bacteremia resulting in
hypovolemic and septic shock,
