Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 55 year-old man with a history with myxomatous
mitral valve and moderate to severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] syndrome
presented with two weeks of high-grade fevers from 103.0 to as
high as 105.0.  He had these on a daily basis multiple times a
day.  The patient was able to control his fever during the
daytime with multiple doses of acetaminophen (1 g q6h) however
otherwise at night he said that when he woke up in the morning
he soaked the bed with sweat.  Otherwise, the patient did not
have any localizing symptoms except for mild dyspnea and cough.
He also reported a mild neck pain which he stated was from
laying in bed for so long.  He did not have neck stiffness,
photophobia, headache or other neurological symptoms.  The
patient did not have any chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
or urinary changes.  He last had dental work in [**2154-12-1**] and
took amoxicillin at that time.  He had otherwise not taken
antibiotics or been hospitalized recently.  He had not traveled
out of the country in more than ten years or left the [**Location (un) 86**]
area in several months.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 103.8, HR 110, BP 152/76, RR 20,
Sat 93% RA.  Before starting fluids, his O2 saturation dropped
to the mid 80s on 2L. CXR showed a right middle lobe pneumonia.
Blood cultres were drawn before starting gentamicin,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin to cover for ICU
community-acquired pneumonia and also for endocarditis.

myxomatous mitral valve disease with partial P2 flail,
moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation but normal left
ventricular dimensions and systolic function
hypertension
mild dyslipidemia

CXR [**2155-2-25**]: There is a new widespread opacity along the right
mid lung with patchy left peri and infrahilar opacification as
well, suggesting multifocal pneumonia. Elsewhere, the lungs
appear clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
.
TTE [**2155-2-26**]: Parial mitral leaflet flail with eccentric,
moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Valve is structurally
thickened and has probable torn chordae associated with it;
cannot definitively exclude a vegetation vs. myxomatous
degeneration but appears similar to prior study of [**2154-8-20**].
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-8-20**],
the estimated pulmonary artery pressures are higher. The
severity of regurgitation may be slightly increased. The valve
structurally appears similar.
.
CT TORSO [**2155-2-26**]: 1. Multifocal pneumonia involving both lungs.
No evidence for abscess.  2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Normal examination of the abdomen and pelvis with incidental
finding of a left renal cyst as well as a subcentimeter
hypodense lesion in the left kidney that is too small to
characterize but likely also represents a cyst.
.
RUQ ULTRASOUND [**2155-3-2**]: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound.
.
TEE [**2155-3-6**]: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is moderate/severe posterior
leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is partial P2 mitral
leaflet flail. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS:  Given the patient's abnormal mitral
valve, weeks of high fevers, and blood cultures positive for
Streptococcus viridans in the setting of a recent dental
procedure, he most likely has endocarditis.  The organism is
sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone, and the latter was
ultimately chosen for treatment since it would be easier for the
patient to adhere to a regimen of daily infusions rather than
q4h infusions.  The initial TTE did not show any vegetations or
significant changes in the valve from the prior study.  We
consulted the infectious disease service, who recommended that
the patient be on four weeks of ceftria
