Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2144-12-2**] Mitral valve repair with a 26-mm
annuloplasty ring (physio II).


History of Present Illness:
78F with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter and
hypothyroidism who presented to the ED with complaint of
shortness of breath and low grade fever, associated with cough.
Patient states that she has been short of breath for the few
weeks since her recent admission on [**10-30**] at [**Hospital3 **] for
A. Fib with RVR.  Prior to that admission, PAF was well
controlled for 3 years.  During that admission, Rythmol dose was
doubled.  She subsequently followed up with her cardiologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10543**], last week at which time her Rythmol dose was
decreased back to her normal dose of 225 mg [**Hospital1 **] of SR
formulation and her pacemaker setting was decreased to 100.  The
next 24 hours she became so short of breath that she was unable
to carry out any activities, barely able to walk a few steps.
She returned to his office the next day and pacemaker was re-set
to 110, with some improvement in symptoms.  She then developed
worsening shortness of breath over last weekend with another
visit to her cardiologist 2 days prior to presentation.  She
reports a CXR showed fluid on her lungs, she declined lasix at
that time.  Since then, has had worsening shortness of breath,
non-productive cough and fever x 1 to 100.4 last night.
Overnight, she noted worsening shortness of breath, unable to
sleep and necessitating sitting up in a chair all night.  Also
noted belching, nausea, and substernal chest pain x 24 hours,
worse with coughing, non-radiating.  Of note, has had 3 pound
weight gain over past week.  Denies syncope, peripheral edema.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.4  142/72  82  24  97%RA
Patient was given Zofran 4 mg for nausea, ASA 325 mg and NTG
0.4mg SL x 3 for chest discomfort.  After chest x-ray, due to
concern for CHF vs. PNA, was given Lasix 20 mg IV x 1 and
Cefepime 2g IV x 1.
.
On the floor, patient is in no acute distress.  She continues to
complain of some shortness of breath and occasional cough.

ECHO was done revealing severe mitral regurg and moderate aortic
stenosis

ECHO [**2144-11-23**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is
mildly increased with preserved free wall motion. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets with severe
mitral regurgitation. Severe pulmlonary artery systolic
hypertension. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
preserved systolic function. Normal left ventricular cavity size
with preserved regional and global systolic function.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.

TEE [**2144-11-24**] - No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). (Intrinisic LV function may be depressed given the
presence of significant mitral regurgitation). There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is no frank mitral
valve prolapse but there is some leaflet redundancy. Moderate to
severe (3+) central mitral regurgitation is seen. No reversal of
flow is identified in the pulmonary veins (4 seen entering the
left atrium). There is at least moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Conclusions  Prebypass
The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no structural
abnormality seen with the mitral valve. The mitral regurgitation
is central with an annulus size of 3.8 cm. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2144-12-2**] at 1330pm.
Post bypass
Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine
and epinephrine. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. It appears well
seated and there is no resid
