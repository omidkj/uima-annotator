.
Echo [**4-30**]
Suboptimal image quality. Regional systolic dysfunction
consistent with prior myocardial infarction. Right ventricular
dilation and dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation.
.
CXR [**4-28**]
In comparison with the study of [**4-26**], there are slightly lower
lung
volumes. Persistent bibasilar atelectasis without acute
pneumonia. The
pulmonary vessels are slightly less well seen, raising the
possibility of some increasing pulmonary venous pressure.
There has been interval placement of a right IJ catheter that
appears to turn towards the midline and extend into the left
brachiocephalic vein.



Brief Hospital Course:
72 year-old male with a history of refractory UC on chronic
prednisone, s/p total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy
[**4-24**] with post op MICU monitoring for extubation. Pt was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 5. On the surgical floor, the patient
had been advanced to tolerating regular diet, and was seen by
heme onc for evaluation of pancytopenia with working diagnosis
of MDS. Patient was doing well until [**4-28**], when after being
given first dose of beta blocker at 9am (Carvedilol 6.25mg PO)
patient was found approxmimately 2 hours later, somnolent and
difficult to arouse. BP was unable to be easily obtained at the
bedside so a code blue was called. Upon arrival of the code
team, the patient was arousable and responding to commands. BP
placed on the leg registered 67/47. O2 sat was 100% on 2L NC.
Patient was in sinus bradycardia, with rates in the 40s. Pt. was
very nervous but denied chest pain, SOB, abd. pain. He had also
received 20mg IV of lasix earlier in the day.  He was than
transferred back to MICU after code blue on [**Hospital Ward Name **] 5 for
hypotension, bradycardia, and decreased mental status.
.
On arrival to MICU, patient was alert, conversant, anxious but
able to consent to procedures, and denying abdominal pain, chest
pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness. Patient's BP on
arrival was 59/43, started on Levophed and given fluids with
response in SBP to 116/82. Hct 23.2 down from baseline of 27,
platelets 35, recent INR 1.3, with no evidence of active
bleeding. Patient with only single lumen right PICC for access
so emergent RIJ triple lumen central line was successfully
placed for access and CVP monitoring.
.
The patient returned to [**Location **] five. The ostomy RN and [**Name8 (MD) **]
RN provided teaching to patient and wife regarding ostomy care
and assessment. VNA will follow at home and provide further
teaching.
.
Cardiology was consulted for hypotension and bradycardia. This
was most likely secondary to meds. No [**Last Name (un) **] elevation. EF 40%
unchanged. He was started on lopressor 12.5 TID and will follow
up with cardiology. An appointment was made with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]

The patient complained of ear pain x1 month. He stated he saw a
ENT doctor and both ears were "cleaned out" in [**Month (only) 958**]. His ENT
doctor stated his hears were "fine" however he still c/o of a
throbbing pain. The patient stated he did not want to make an
appointment with an ENT doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 18**] and that he will follow
up with a new ENT closer to home. The patient's ear was examined
and it was with in normal limits.
.
He was seen by physical therapy and they recommended that the
patient be d/c'd with home physical therapy. He would like to
have his hematologist preform the bone marrow biopsy so he will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week. I touched base with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and he would like the patient to call and make an
appointment once he gets home. He will follow up with his PCP,
