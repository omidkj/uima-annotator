Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
AICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63 y/o M hx CAD s/p CABG in [**2175**] and s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 28525**] in [**2190**]
(anatomy unclear at time of admission), s/p [**Company 1543**] AICD
placement and biventricular pacer in [**2189**] for Vfib arrest, Type
II DM, CHF (EF40%), and s/p AVR with St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical valve
on coumadin presents after ICD firing X 6 times.
.
Today, patient was sitting at home watching football game (8PM)
when he had a few seconds of pressure in chest consistent with
previous ICD firing episodes before ICD fired. He called 911,
EMS noted VT, and went to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] hospital. His ICD fired
a total of 6 times until he arrived at OSH. At OSH, received
amiodarone 150 mg X 2 and started amio gtt. Tx to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], potassium 2.9, and EKG with U waves c/w
hypokalemia. No further firing since arrival to OSH. Further hx
revealed that yesterday, he did not take his K (normally takes
60 meq daily) after script ran out, and today took only 40 meq
later than usual (at 3PM). Also, this AM he did not take any of
his AM meds including amiodarone until 3PM. EP saw patient and
interrogated ICD which revealed 9 episodes of VT each lasting
for 8-12 seconds, 6 treatments. He received K 60 PO, 10 IV in
ED.
.
This is the 3rd episode of ICD firing since it was placed in
[**2189**] for Vfib arrest. Then in [**2190**], while playing golf it fired
in setting of chest pain and was subsequently found to have
?graft occlusion (hx needs to be clarified with OSH records).
Then, recently on [**2193-12-18**], ICD fired 48 times, and he went
to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Last Name (un) 17679**]. Per wife, he underwent VT ablation but no
inducible foci found. He was initially hyperkalemic and then
hypokalemic at the time. EP fellow note reports that K was 2.5
at that time. Amiodarone was increased to 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] at that
time.
.
Currently, in CCU, pt reports feeling well with no complaints.
No further firing for 6 hrs.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for + PND [**2-19**] X per month.
Weight up 3 pounds from dry weight (177->180 lbs), +
intermittent leg and abd edema. Otherwise no chest pain, dyspnea
on exertion (can climb 3 flights of stairs with minimal
difficulty), syncope or presyncope.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain, but does get cramps when K low. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Pertinent Results:
CXR on admission: No acute cardiopulmonary process
.
Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior, anterolateral, and inferolateral hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. A mechanical aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for
this prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction consistent with multivessel CAD. Moderate to severe
mitral regurgitation. Mechanical aortic valve is not well seen,
but the transvalvular gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
Moderate estimated pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
The following were active issues during this hospitalization:
.
1. AICD activation: The patient's ICD was interrogated and was
found to have fired 6 times for ventricular tachycardia.  This
occured in the setting of hypokalemia (admission potassium of
2.9) afer missing a dose of supplemental potassium and in the
setting of a missed dose of amiodarone. His admission EKG showed
u waves. His potassium was aggressively repleted on admission,
and he was placed on an amiodarone drip.  He was seen by the EP
service and converted to a po regimen of amiodarone at 200mg
qday.  His potassium level normalized, as did his EKG.  He
remained in normal sinus rhythm thereafter.  We also initiated
an ACE inhibitor to give him some potassium sparing with his
home regimen of lasix, which he tolerated well.
.
2. Hypokalemia: He was noted to have quite stubborn hypokalemia
throughout his hospitalization.  We did the following to help
control this: His lasix dose was decreased to 40mg daily as this
was thought to be the main reason for potassium wasting; we
added lisinopril for potassium sparing properties; and we
increased his daily supplemental potassium dose to 80mEQ daily.
He will have close follow up with his cardiologist for
monitoring
.
3. INR: His INR was low at 1.4, so he was discharged with a
lovenox bridge and close follow-up for INR monitoring.
.
2. History of CHF: On his admission exam, he was noted to be
slightly fluid overloaded with inspiratory crackles on lung
exam, and some pitting edema on his sacrum.  We performed an
echocardiogram to establish a baseline which showed
anterior/anterolateral/inferolateral hypokinesis with EF 40%, 3+
TR, and moderate PA HTN.
