History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old female with history of asthma, DM, HTN,
and OSA presenting with increasing lethargy since this morning.
Per her daughter [**Name (NI) **], the patient has been quite lethargic
over the past few days, but tonight at 8pm (the evening prior to
admission), she complained of "pain everywhere" and her mental
status deteriorated quickly from there with decreased
responsiveness. She described a sensation of difficulty
breathing, pointing to her throat, and asked [**Hospital1 **] to call
911. When EMS arrived, she was minimally responsive, hypoxic on
room air, but still protecting her airway. FS measured at 190.
She denies any access to narcotic medications in the house and
the patient takes ibuprofen only for her chronic osteoarthritis
pain. Most recent changes in meds were addition of olanzapine
and increased in gabapentin dose about 1 month ago.
.
In the ED, she was minimally verbally responsive, did not follow
commands, and was not reactive to pain (IV stick). Her lungs
were clear and head CT unremarkable. Her O2 sats dropped to 78%
on 2L NC, improved to 96% when sat upright. Portable CXR showed
some bilateral pleural effusions and some vascular congestion,
with BNP of 351 (mildly elevated above her baseline). She
received naloxone without any change in her mental status. She
also received 1 dose each of vanc/zosyn as well as 40mg IV lasix
and a nitro gtt. She received 1.5 hours of CPAP and a repeat ABG
was unchanged (7.20/123/67/50). Her last normal ABG in [**2124**] was
7.43/56/119/38. She was then intubated, with subsequent
improvement in her ABG to 7.45/57/86/41, and started on
propofol. She was afebrile at transfer with a HR of 75, BP
108/58, RR 22 on AC at a PEEP of 8 and FiO2 40%.
.
She was most recently seen by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-31**] for a
pre-operative check-up prior to planned retinal surgery in
[**Month (only) 958**]. She was in good health at that point, with
well-controlled t2DM (HbA1c 7.4 on [**2127-12-24**]) and no acute
complaints. Of note, she had a recent fall just last week and
also in [**2127-7-16**], when she fell out of bed somehow with
the railing up and was found face first against the floor by her
daughter.

[**2128-1-4**]: CT head non contrast
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or acute
territorial infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration. Note is made of bilateral basal ganglia
calcifications and extensive parafalcine calcification. In
addition, note is made of hyperostosis frontalis. There is no
fracture. The mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are well
pneumatized and aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
[**2128-1-5**] CT Chest:
FINDINGS: Since the prior examination, the patient has undergone
endotracheal tube placement with tip in standard position 4.5 cm
above the carina. A nasogastric tube courses below the
diaphragm. The lungs are unchanged in appearance demonstrating
extensive perihilar opacification and probable small bilateral
pleural effusions, most compatible with interstitial pulmonary
edema. There are no new focal consolidations. Cardiomediastinal
and hilar contours are stable. Pulmonary vascularity is
increased with redistribution and cephalization.
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube in standard position with tip 4.5 cm above
the carina.
2. Unchanged pulmonary edema.
.
[**2128-1-6**] CT pa/lat:
Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day
earlier in the
morning.
Aeration of the right lower lobe has improved. Small bilateral
pleural
effusions are associated with adjacent opacities, left greater
than right,
consistent with atelectasis that on the left have minimally
increased from two days before. The upper lobes are clear. There
is no pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 81 year old woman with history of asthma and OSA who
presented with progressive decrease in the level of
consciousness secondary to CO2 narcosis that was refractory to
naloxone and noninvasive ventilation. She developed hypercapnic
respiratory failure (recurrent, her last admission for
hypercarbia was in [**2124-12-15**] that responded quickly to BiPAP
from an asthma exacerbation caused by influenza). She has
stopped using BiPAP at home for several months (due to
development of tactile hallucinations). She was intubated for
several hours while in he ICU for hypercapnic respiratory
failure (MICU attributed that to increased doses of gabapentin
and olanzapine and hypoventilation). She was extubated without
complication. She has a high C02 at baseline.  Her head CT
showed no central cause of hypercarbia.  Infectious work up was
negative, she had no leukocytosis, and there was no evidence of
SIRS/sep
