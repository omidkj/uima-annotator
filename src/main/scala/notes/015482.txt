Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 61456**]
Chief Complaint:
TF for cirrhosis and GI bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
upper endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old woman transferred from NEBH for increased
ascites and GI bleeding. She was initially admitted there on
[**2170-5-9**] directly from the office for workup of ascites. She
initally was noted to have increased LFT's and hepatic
enlargement in [**2170-1-4**], and ultrasound showed homogenous
liver surrounded by ascites. She then was lost to follow up
until [**Month (only) 958**], when she noted increasing abdominal girth. She was
admitted to NEBH and noted to have ascites and LE edema. CT of
the chest, abdomen, pelvis with only oral contrast was
remarkable for possible cirrhosis, massive ascites, no
splenomegaly, no hepatic lesion, and thick esophagus. She had a
large volume paracentesis of 5 liters of [**5-11**]. She was stable
until [**5-14**] when she developed coffee ground emesis and liquid
stool. She then began to vomit increasing amounts of bright red
blood the morning of [**2170-5-15**] and became lightheaded. Her hct
fell to 26 and she received a total of 4 units of blood.
Emergent EGD showed lots of blood in teh stomach, grade IV
varices without ulcer, and a wheal on one varix. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.
.
She admits to drinking about 1 liter of wine daily, but hasn't
had a drink since [**3-12**]. Workup for her increased abdominal girth
and ascites included normal alpha 1 antitrypsin, negative Hep B
surface antigen, equivocal Hep B core antibody, normal ferritin
of 63, negative AMA.
.
She reports about a 40 pound weight gain over the last few
months. She has felt depressed over the last few days and missed
some meals and had increased somnolence. She reports less
frequent urination recently, and loose stools that turned black
over the last day. She reports no shortness oof breath or chest
pain. No changes in skin color, pruritis. No fevers but
occasional chills at home.


Past Medical History:
Aortic stenosis
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
Asthma
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
s/p r. Total Hip Replacement 99
s/p Tonsillectomy

Social History:
The patient is [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, widowed. Nonsmoker but drink s about a
liter of wine daily and used to drink vodka when her husband was
alive.


Family History:
father died during CEA. Mom had [**Name2 (NI) **]. No FH of liver problems,
diabetes, emphysema.


Physical Exam:
T98.8 P93 BP 126/63 R18 96% 2LNC
Gen: No apparent distress, coughing intermittently
HEENT: scleral icterus, PERRLA, OP clear, MM slightly dry
Neck: No JVD
Resp: coarse bilaterally no wheezes
CV: RRR n1 s1s2 2/6 SEM RUSM
Abd: very distended, obese, tense, tympanic to palpation over
upper areas with dullness on sides. +BS
Ext: 2+ pitting edema, no cyanosis, clubbing, edema
Neuro: A+Ox3, no asterixis, strength 5/5 UE and LE.


Pertinent Results:
CXR: no acute cardiopulmonary process
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.  There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2169-6-27**], probably no major change.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) GI bleed with varices - according to OSH report, grade IV
varices present with stigmata of bleeding. Patient s/p EGD which
showed gIII varices s/p 3 bands [**5-16**], no active bleeding.
Patient also required 1 unit PRBCs for Hct 23 -> 26 on [**5-16**].
Patient does have history of EtOH abuse, but no evidence of
cirrhosis on US, although fatty liver is still a possibility.
Patient also has portal vein thrombosis which may be
contributing to her portal HTN and variceal stigmata.  The
patient was transfused 3 units of PRBCs initially, hct
stabilized.  She finished a five-day course of octreotide and a
7-day course of Levofloxacin for prophylaxis, and a PPI [**Hospital1 **].
Repeat EGD on [**5-23**] showed grade I varices with no bleeding.
Nadolol and a carafate slurry were started, and the pt was
discharged with GI followup and recommendation to repeat EGD in
6 weeks.
.
#) Hypoxia/persistent oxygen dependence. Pt arrived on 3 L.
Patient has h/o asthma since childhood, but never hospitalized
or required steroids. Nl Echo on [**6-8**], although no comment on
MV, had AS.  An echo was repeated, which was essentially
unchanged.  Her breathing improved with standing nebs and
advair.  She did not have any symptoms to suggest PNA as cause
of hypoxia. By discharge, she was breathing comfortably and
satting in the low- to mid-90s on room air.
.
#) Cirrhosis of unclear etiology - had antitrypsin, AMA, Hep B.

On admission, hepatitis serologies and [**Doctor First Name **] were sent, which
showed that she was Hep B Immunized, and an Hep A vaccine
ordered.  She had an abdominal ultrasound that was positive for
portal vein thrombus, no evidence of cirrhosis.  A AFP was nl @
1.4.  She underwent a diagnostic/therapeutic of 6 L on [**5-16**]; no
evidence of SBP; SAAG (2.5 - <1.0 = > 1.1); tProtein 0.7.  She
underwent a second paracentesis on [**5-18**] with 6 L removed and
albumin replaced.  She was also started on lasix and Aldactone.
She underwent a third large volume paracentesis on [**5-22**] with 7L
removed and albumin replaced. She was discharged on 60mg Lasix
qd and 100mg spironolactone qd.
.
#) hypertension - normotensive.
.
#) depression - celexa was held until she was tolerating PO meds

.
#) aortic valve replacement - tissue valve so no need for
anticoagulation
