Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with 2-vessel coronary disease who presented
with SOB x3 days.  Per history obtained from daughter, patient
had her carpets cleaned by [**Doctor First Name **] Steamer on Monday and
subsequently has experienced unremitting wheezing.  Patient has
associated her symptoms with chemical exposure from the carpet
cleaning.  Daughter also reports upper respiratory "rattle."  At
midnight, patient became acutely short of breath and EMS was
called.  Patient's daughter endorses dietary indiscretion with
consumption of sauerkraut.  Patient did not feel her symptoms
over the past three days to be consistent with her typical
symptoms of heart failure exacerbation.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative except for some mild flank pain on the
right side for the last 5 days. No N, V, abd pain, f, c, ns or
cough. Pt reported fall out of bed in her sleep 3 weeks ago with
resulting lacteration on her head, requiring 15 staples. No
headache, confusion, vision changes or weakness.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.
Patient has had dyspnea on exertion and ankle edema for the past
few days.  Family denies an PND, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.
.
Upon arrival at OSH, pt was found to be unresponsive, breathing
on a NRB. Pt was emergently intubated. CXR was consistent with
bilateral pulmonary edema at OSH. EKG showed STD depressions
V3-V6 and TW flattening in V3-V6. Pt received Lasix 40mg and
urinated about 1L en route to [**Hospital1 18**].  Pt received aspirin and
started on Heparin gtt and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. She also received Soulmedrol 125mg x1 at the OSH
before transfer
.
In the ED, she received ASA 325 mg, Levofloxacin 750 mg, and
Propofol for sedation.  Heparin gtt started in ED. Pt was
hypertensive in the ED but normotensive on arrival to the CCU.

ECHO [**2200-11-13**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal
septal hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is mild pulmonic valve
stenosis. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild pulmonic stenosis.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute on chronic CHF: Ischemic event leading to acute CHF was
ruled out with cardiac enzymes. They were slightly elevated, but
this was likely due to demand ischemia. An echo was done showing
an EF of 50% and increased wedge pressure. She also had elevated
JVP, rales and LE edema.  She was diuresed with IV lasix until
euvolemic, and switched to PO lasix on discharged. Her
creatinine rose secondary to lasix, and it will be held day
after discarged and followed up at rehab facility. It can be
restarted when it trends down. She was seen by nutrition, who
went over dietary modifications and the importance of a low
sodium diet.
.
2. CAD: Suspect troponin leak in the setting of heart failure
exacerbation. Trend cardiac enzymes, trending down. Continue
Aspirin, metoprolol. holding ACEi in setting of ARF.
.
3. Respiratory status. patient intubated in OSH. Respiratory
status stable, blood gas normal, patient extubated day after
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. Respiratory status stable.
.
4. Acute renal failure: likely due to poor forward flow.
Creatinine worsening, likely seconadary to diuresis. will
followup in rehab.
.
5. Anemia- stable in hospital, macrocytic. b12 and folate within
normal limits.
.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: cont Lipitor
.
7. Anxiety: cont cymbalata
