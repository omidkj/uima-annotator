EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
79 year old man with diastolic heart failure, chronic afib, CHF,
CRI, male breast cancer s/p masectomy with two recent admissions
presents with anuria and malaise. He was hospitalized from
[**Date range (1) 18845**] with a CHF exacerbation, and was diuresed 30 lbs (to
dry weight of 155 lbs). He was then hospitalized from [**11-29**]-
[**12-6**] with e coli urosepsis, treated with 4 weeks IV
ceftriaxone. Recent echo concerning for endocarditis due to ?
endocarditis. Seen in [**Hospital **] clinic [**1-10**]. No evidence of active
infection at time of visit. Culture neg endocaritis panel
pending at this time - sent as pt had persistent fever after
treatment for e.coli infection. At cardiology visit on [**1-11**] pt
found to be in ARF with Cr of 3.3 and evidence of worsening
volume overload. He was advised to come into the hospital.
Metolazone was discontinued and he was advised to hold his
torsemide. His digoxin and allopurinol were also held.
On admission today the patient reports increased edema of LE as
well as increasing abdominal distention. No urine output today.
His wife notes he has become increasing somnulent. The patient
denies dyspnea and states he has been able to walk around his
home. Does not climb stairs - utilizes chair lift. His wife adds
that he has required a walker for ambulation over the past few
days. He has had increased loose stools [**2-28**] daily for past days,
worse than his baseline. He is complaining of thirst and reports
good appetite.
On arrival to the ED the patient has an intial SBP in 90s and HR
60s, then pressure dipped to mid 70s but he continued to mentate
well. He was started on lasix gtt at 20mg/hr and received diuril
250mg.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative. Complains of fatigue and loose
stools as above.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations. The patient does report intermittent
lightheadedness with standing.

CXR [**2113-1-12**] - AP UPRIGHT CHEST: There has been interval removal
of a left-sided PICC. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette is stable. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
unchanged. Mild vascular engorgement and redistribution is again
identified, consistent with mild volume overload. There is a
stable moderate right pleural effusion with chronic right volume
loss and right basilar opacity, likely atelectasis. No
pneumothorax is identified. Visualized bony structures of the
thorax are stable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarged cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular
redistribution consistent with mild volume overload.
2. Stable moderate right pleural effusion with right basilar
opacity, likely atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia is
not excluded.
.
Renal US [**2113-1-13**]
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 12.3 cm and the left kidney
measures 13.4 cm. Again seen are multiple simple cysts on each
of the kidneys. The largest cyst on the right kidney measures
6.3 x 7.0 x 7.8 cm. The largest cyst on the left kidney measures
14.0 x 12.4 x 11.6 cm. There is no hydronephrosis seen and no
solid masses or stones are identified in either kidney. There is
ascites noted within the abdomen and a right pleural effusion is
also seen. A Foley catheter is identified within the minimally
distended bladder. The bladder wall is noted to be thickened.
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Multiple simple renal cysts.
3. Ascites with right pleural effusion.
4. Thickened bladder wall.
.
Cath [**1-13**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
2. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3. Successful insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump, albeit
with
minimal systolic unloading.
4. Atrial fibrillation.
5. Catheter-induced ventricular tachycardia.
.
TTE [**1-14**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial anterior mitral
leaflet flail. There is small vegetation on the mitral valve
(remnant of prior endocarditis). An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (due
to the eccentric nature of the mitral reg
