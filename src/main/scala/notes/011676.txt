PERTINENT STUDIES:
CT CHEST ([**2125-5-19**]): Mutlifocal areas of ground glass opacity are
seen. The largest is a focal rounded large ground-glass opacity
in the posterior right upper lobe measuring 2.7 x 2.7 cm, may be
infectious or inflammatory in etiology. Additional foci of
ground-glass opacities are seen in the lingula and left upper
lobe. Consider follow up CT exam (6 weeks) after treatment for
possible infection, to exclude the possibility of
bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Cardiomegaly. Dense coronary artery
and thoracic aortic calcification. Prominent central pulmonary
arteries, can be seen in association with pulmonary
hypertension.
.
CT HEAD ([**2125-8-9**]): No hemorrhage, large territorial infarction,
edema, mass, or shift of normally midline structures is present.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation is preserved. The ventricles and
sulci have normal size and configuration for age. The basilar
cisterns are widely patent. Mild periventricular hypodensities
are consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
.
CXR ([**2125-8-10**]): Severe cardiomegaly is stable. Small right
pleural effusion may have increased. Pulmonary vascular
congestion is longstanding. No definite pneumonia.
.
Abdominal US ([**2125-8-12**])
1. Cholelithiasis and sludge without definite signs of acute
cholecystitis.  Normal caliber CBD.
2. No abdominal ascites.
3. Small right pleural effusion, engorged IVC and hepatic veins
suggest heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old female with HTN, HLD, DM, CAD s/p CABG in [**2111**], CHF
and Afib (on coumadin) admitted with altered mental status and
two day history of dyspnea on exertion thought to be [**2-21**] CHF
exacerbation.

She was initially admitted to medicine on [**2125-8-9**] for management
of CHF exacerbation, but on the floor her mental status
declined; ABG showed PaCO2=94. She was transferred to the CCU
and given BIPAP.  In the CCU, she was found to have a UTI
(pan-sensitive Klebsiella) and treated with a 7-day course of
ciprofloxacin from [**8-11**] to [**8-17**].  She was transferred back to
medicine on [**2125-8-16**], where she triggered for O2 sat in the 80s
and she was transferreed back to the CCU and then to the MICU
for acute hypercarbia. She spent 4 days in the MICU and was
transferred to the medicine floor, where she had stable O2 sats
in the mid-90s. On the floor, she had a diagnostic sleep study
confirming complex sleep apnea, PFTs confirming restrictive lung
disease, and her CHF was managed on her home dose of Lasix (40mg
PO BID). Pt's alertness improved during her hospital stay and
she was discharged to a rehab facility for further monitoring.

Altered mental status: Likely due to delirium from UTI and/or
hypercarbia. Her mental status and hypercarbia along with
respiratory acidosis improved with BiPaP.  UA was notable for
pyuria with urine culture growing pansensitive Klebsiella. She
was started on ciprofloxacin 500 mg po BID for 7 days for
complicated UTI. Her mental status improved significantly with
patient being back to her baseline prior to transfer to the
floor.  She was somnolent on HD #9 and her ABG showed PCO2 in
the 70s.  She was transferred to CCU service and re
