Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Left leg weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 72 yo LHM with a prior SAH ([**2106**]), HTN, HLD, was out
bowling
today, as he does routinely on a Wednesday morning at 10 am, and
while attempting to bend down and aim the ball, his left leg
suddenly felt weak, numb, and heavy. He could not move his left
leg, and the EMS took him to his nearest hospital. He was found

vertex in the parietal lobe with a small amount of blood
tracking
along the falx, with associated sulcal effacement without
midline
shift in his CT head.

palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, abdominal pain,
dysuria, fevers or chills.

Left Babinski, Right predominantly a withdrawal response

Coordination: finger-nose-finger with mild dysmetria noted on
the
left, heel to shin normal on the R only, RAMs normal.

At time of discharge neurological examination included:

VS 98.1F/Tm 98.8F 118/63 (SBP 113->140); HR 90-100; RR 16-20; O2
sat 95%-99% on RA.

Mental status:

Fluctuates between being awake, opening eyes to voice and
requiring noxious stimulation to open eyes.  During either time
of fluctuation, does not respond to commands.  Able to express
pain with grimace but no vocal output.  Abulic.

CNs: 5->3mm pupils b/l, VF intact to threat b/l, face appears
symmetric, able to stick out tongue spontaneously.  Unable to
assess sensation.

Motor:  RUE rigid, spastic, antigravity, decreased bulk.  LUE
[**1-2**] throughout.  RLE spastic, retracts both legs from stimuli,
slight response to stimuli in L arm.

Sensory: withdraws to noxious in all extremities.

Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2108-10-3**]
5:35 PM
FINDINGS: Non-contrast head CT with coronal and sagittal
reformations were
provided. There is a 2.4 x 2.7 x 2.8 cm parenchymal hemorrhage
in the high
convexity of the right posterior frontal lobe. There is also
surrounding areas of linear hyperdensity likely representing
subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is also likely a small amount of
adjacent acute SDH layering along the midline falx. Overall,
findings suggest intraparenchymal hemorrhage with cortical
breakthrough and hemorrhage extending to the extra-axial space.
Compared with the prior outside hospital CT, there is slight
interval increase in size of the intraparenchymal hemorrhagic
focus. Surrounding hypodensity is compatible with edema. There
is again note made of patchy subcortical and periventricular
white matter hypodensity which is likely related to underlying
microvascular ischemic disease. There is no shift of midline
structures or evidence of downward transtentorial herniation.
Global involutional changes compatible with age-related atrophy.
Vascular calcifications along the carotid siphon is noted
bilaterally. The paranasal sinuses are clear. Mastoid air cells
and middle ear cavities are well aerated. No calvarial fracture
is seen.

IMPRESSION:
Parenchymal hemorrhage at the right frontal high convexity with
cortical
breakthrough and resultant adjacent extra-axial hemorrhage.
Overall, slightly larger when compared with outside hospital
study. Given the location of the hemorrhage and the underlying
white matter disease, the possibility of amyloid angiopathy may
be considered. An underlying lesion cannot be excluded, though
none was seen on a prior brain MR from [**2107-8-3**].

CT head [**10-6**]

FINDINGS: There is new intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the left
frontal lobe,
with adjacent subarachnoid blood. There is a rim of edema around
this new
hemorrhage, which measures approximately 4.1 cm (TRV) x 2.4 cm
(AP). The
right posterior frontal lobe parenchymal hemorrhage with
adjacent subarachnoid
hemorrhage is similar in size and morphology to the previous
study. The
ventricles are similar in size and configuration. There is no
uncal or
transtentorial herniation. There is no shift of midline
structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-
white matter differentiation is preserved. No intraventricular
blood is
identified. Basal cisterns are patent. The paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air
cells remain clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. New left frontal parenchymal hemorrhage with adjacent
subarachnoid
hemorrhage and surrounding edema.
2. Little change of the right posterior frontal lobe parenchymal
hemorrhage
with adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage

MR head w/ and w/o, MRV

IMPRESSION:
1. Redemonstration of the areas of acute-subacute hemorrhage, in
the right
frontal/parietal location and acute hemorrhage, in the acute
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, in the left frontal lobe. The etiology for the
hemorrhage is
unclear from the present study. Can relate to amyloid
angiopathy, HTN,
or other etiologies; no obvious mass lesions, aneurysm noted;
assessment for
cortical venous thrombosis is limited due to superimposed SAH
and cannot be
