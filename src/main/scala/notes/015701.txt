History of Present Illness:
79yoM with h/o dementia, CHF (EF 55% with regurg), s/p pacer,
s/p MVR/AVR, admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 63728**]/06 with right hip pain
and diagnosed with MRSA UTI, LLL pneumonia, and C.difficile
infection, discharge to [**Hospital **] Rehab where today he was found
obtunded with agonal respirations and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Prior
hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure due to
prerenal azotemia, delirium, coagulopathy due to
supratherapeutic warfarin, and hypothyroidism. He was discharged
to [**Hospital1 **] on a continued course of azithromycin, vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and metronidazole. He completed all courses other
than the metronidazole which was scheduled to continue for
14days after completion of other antibiotics. This had been
changed to po vancomycin. He was also on PCN V ?infection.
According to records from [**Hospital1 **] the patient was short of
breath on the night prior to presentation, agitated, and refused
all food and po medications. Today his oxygen saturation dropped
to low 80%s, and he was placed on a non-rebreather mask. Lasix
was administered, and saturation improved to 96%. Per EMS report
patient was obtunded, moving extremities but not responding to
voice or pain, with agonal respirations RR 10. However, transfer
report from [**Hospital1 **] reports VS on transfer BP 107/63 HR 62 RR
22 100%on NRB. He was intubated in the field for airway
protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

On arrival to the ED VS T 96.0R HR 63 BP 83/31 RR 16 100%vent.
He received 1L NS bolus, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
metronidazole. BP improved to 105/55 prior to transfer to the
ICU. ABG in ED reported to be 7.16/63/46 on 100%FiO2, although
was likely venous. Repeat ABG unchanged. On presentation to the
ICU he is intubated and sedated but responding to pain and
manipulation by swinging arms bilaterally. no response to
commands. withdraws to pain in all four extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
79yoM with h/o vascular dementia, CHF, CAD s/p CABG, s/p
MVR/AVR, chronic kidney disease p/w hypothermia, acidemia,
delirium.

# Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection in field,
hypercapneic and hypoxemic on admission. CXR concerning for
untreated PNA, community-acquired vs rehab-acquired vs
aspiration. Pt tolerated extubation well. Satting fine on O2 by
NC. Nothing growing in cultures. Initial presentation likely [**1-29**]
oversedation followed by aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. Pt
made DNR/DNI during later part of admission, then soon made CMO
and palliative care consulted. Pt discharged to palliative care.

# CKD: h/o CKD but creatinine 1.0 prior to last hospitalization
during which he suffered acute prerenal azotemia. Creatinine now
1.6. Likely new baseline is 1.2-1.4.

# Acidemia: Resolved after intubation. Patient had combined
non-gap metabolic and respiratory acidosis on admission that
resolved on the ventilator. Had elevated lactate and hypothermia
on admission that was concerning for sepsis. Respiratory
component likely [**1-29**] oversedation at rehab facility. Head CT
unchanged from prior.

# CHF: EF >55% on echo [**2195-12-7**]. No acute decompensation.
Initially held metoprolol given concern for sepsis. Not on ACE
likely [**1-29**] recent acute renal failure. Volume status managaed
with prn furosemide.

# CAD: s/p CABG. Elevated troponin on admission with nml CK
likely due to strain in setting of renal dysfuction.

# s/p MVR/AVR: INR supratherapeutic on admission; held warfarin
given acute decompensation. Discharged to palliative care.
