.
ECHO [**7-10**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral
walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF
= 35 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. A vegetation cannot be excluded if
clinically suggested. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Thickened aortic valve leaflets with severe aortic
regurgitation. Cannot excluded endocarditis if clinically
suggested. Regional and global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild aortic valve stenosis.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**7-10**]:
COMMENTS:
A transvenous temporary pacing wire was placed through the right
CFV
into the right ventricle and pacing capture was tested. The
right CFA
sheath was upsized to 8F. 3000u of Heparin was given
prophylactically
and a therapeutic ACT was confirmed. A straight wire was able to
cross
the aortic valve after much difficulty. This was then exchanged
for an
Amplatz super stiff wire over a Pigtail catheter. An 18x60mm
Tyshek II
balloon was advanced to the aortic valve. Rapid ventricular
pacing was
initiated at 180 bpm with successful reduction of BP to less
than 50mmHg
and the Tyshek II balloon was fully inflated across the aortic
valve.
This procedure was then repeated x 2. Subsequent
echocardiography
revealed significant aortic insufficiency and the procedure was
terminated. Patient was given 40mg IV lasix as well as IV nitro
drip for
afterload reduction. The patient left the lab free of angina and
in
stable condition.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Successful aortic valvuloplasty.
3. Severe aortic insufficiency.


Brief Hospital Course:

#1 Aortic stenosis s/p Valvuloplasty: Pt underwent a
valvuloplasty on [**2108-7-10**]. complicated by hypertension requiring
nipride drip and low oxygen levels thought to be related to IVF
during the procedure. The patient was transferred to the CCU for
close monitoring. An ECHO after the procedure found that the EF
had improved to 35% with the aortic valve area 1.6 and gradient
27. 3+ AR was noted and pt was started on Norvasc for prevention
of progression. Aspirin was also increased to 325 mg daily. Pt
had a CK leak with positive troponin after the procedure. This
was thought to be due to the procedure itself. No EKG changes or
ischemic symptoms. Pt did have some chest discomfort on [**7-11**]
that was thought to be related to her constipation, relieved
with bowel movement. Cardiac catheterization showed no
significant CAD.
.
#2 Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: pt has a
history of 2 recent hospital admissions for CHF. Appeared
euvolemic during this hospital stay. Weight is 40.4kg here. No
peripheral edema or lung crackles. Pt uses oxygen at home
chronically. Continued on home dose of Lasix. No ACEi, [**Last Name (un) **] or
beta blocker is indicated because of severe valve disease per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Daily weights, symptoms of CHF and diet reviewed
with pt and family before discharge.
.
#3 V- paced: EP saw patient and adjusted pacer settings and
feels like patient does not need [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer this admission. Pt
will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 205**] for further assessment.
.
#4 Hypothyroidism: Stable, continue synthroid
.
#5 History of Lung CA s/p right upper lobectomy: Resp status
stable after initial desaturation after valvuloplasty. Pt was
maintained on low flow oxygen which she uses at home.
.
#6 Restless leg: Continued carbidopa-levodopa
.
#7 dispo: VNA at discharge for PT and continued monitoring of
BP, HR and fluid status.
