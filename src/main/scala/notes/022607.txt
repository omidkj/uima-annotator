IMAGING:
CT [**2148-10-6**] from OSH :right frontal CVA verses hemorhage with 7
mm midline
shift. Will need MRI with and without contrast to evaluate for
underlying lesion.

MRI head [**10-7**]
1. Dominant cystic-necrotic mass, largely replacing the right
frontal lobe
with predominantly cystic and acute hemorrhagic components,
involving the
rostrum and crossing the midline to involve the left forceps
minor. The lesion extends superficially with evidence of pial
transgression and probable pachymeningeal involvement.
Subependymal involvement cannot be excluded, as the lesion
effaces the right lateral ventricular frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. The overall
appearance favors high-grade primary neoplasm, likely
glioblastoma multiforme.
2. Small necrotic "satellite" lesion in the right precentral
gyrus, consistent with above.
3. Subfalcine herniation, with 12mm leftward shift of midline
structures, but no evidence of uncal or more central herniation.

4. Three punctate acute infarcts in the territory of the distal
A2 and A3
segments of the right ACA, as a consequence of extrinsic mass
effect and
compression of the neighbouring vessels by the right frontal
mass. No evidence of vascular territorial infarction.

VIDEO SWALLOW [**10-16**]:
Limited examination as described above. Aspiration with
nectar-consistency barium.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**10-6**] Pt admitted to neurosurgery service to the ICU on this day
for continued blood pressure control and q1 neurochecks. She did
well on this day and plan was for MRI with and without contrast
for further evaluation of this R frontal mass. Neurology was
consulted for further recommendations and they agreed with plan
for MRI head with and without contrast and blood pressure
parameters of 100-140 systolic. She was started on dilantin
100mg every 8 hours for seizure prophylaxis and plan was to
check a level [**10-7**] a.m .

[**2059-10-7**] Pt neurological exam remained unchanged. MRI on this day
showed R frontal enhancing mass suspicious for glioma. Dilantin
level was 9.6 and she received no bolus. She was neurologically
stable. She was transferred to the floor on 9.22. Surgery was
discussed with the patient and her family. Neurologic oncology
was consulted and had a long discussion with the family and the
patient.

On [**10-10**] pt and her family were seen by the neuro-oncology team
on this day to discuss further treatment options. The results of
this discussion were to forego any agressive care including
surgery and radiation.

ON [**10-11**] pt was found to be more lethargic on exam. She was
opening eyes to voice and following intermittent commands. She
did appear to be somewhat congested and a chest x ray was
obtained for evaluation. Her chest x ray showed a RLL
consolidation and she was started on triple antibiotic therapy
for hospital aquired pneumonia. Speech and swallow evaluated her
and found her unsafe for any PO diet and felt she had been
aspirating her own secretions.She was made NPO and IV fluids
were started. The family wished to continue [**Hospital 17073**] medical
management of her pneumonia throughout the weekend and
re-evaluate her status on Monday [**10-14**] with the possibility of
CMO if she did not improve.

[**Date range (1) **] She remained on IV antibiotics and IV fluids
throughout the weekend and her exam remained stable. Palliative
care was consulted and the plan was for a family meeting on [**10-14**]
to discuss further care options.

[**10-14**] A family discussion with palliative care and the
neurosurgery team took place on this day. The final plan was to
continue [**Hospital 17073**] medical management of her pneumonia and
discharge to home with and bridge from home VNA to hospice care.

[**10-15**] Patient was switched from IV abx to PO levofloxacin and
will continue antibotics for a total of 10 days. Her exam was
improved on this day. SHe was AOx3, more awake and following
commands. Speech and swallow re-evaluated her and cleared her
for pureed diet with nectar thick liquids.

[**Date range (1) 80149**] Pt found to be more lethargic on exam and oriented
only to self. She was unable to take a PO diet or her PO
medications and she was made NPO with IV fluids and her PO
medications were held. Pt was changed to IV antibiotics and will
continue these for a total of 3 more days. Her last dose of IV
antibiotics for treatment of her pneumonia will be on [**10-18**].
After her final IV dose of antibiotics she will be discharged to
home with hospice care.
