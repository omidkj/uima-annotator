EF >60%
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate
([**12-23**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet
is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
Colonoscopy
Multiple diverticula with mixed openings were seen in the
ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid
colon. Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity. There
were two small, ulcerated diverticula in the sigmoid colon and
one large diverticulum with a large clot over it. The clot could
not be flushed off, but was able to be partially dislodged.
There was active bleeding from the diverticulum after the clot
was removed. 4 injections of [**12-23**] cc. of isotonic saline solution
injections were applied for hemostasis with some success and
decreased bleeding. Two endoclips were applied to the large,
bleeding diverticulum for hemostasis with success. This
diverticulum was located at 32 cm and the other two diverticula
with ulceration were located at 35 cm.
.
Impression: External hemorrhoids
Blood in the sigmoid colon, descending colon, splenic flexure
and rectum
Diverticulosis of the ascending colon, transverse colon,
descending colon and sigmoid colon (injection, ligation)
Stool in the whole colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum


Brief Hospital Course:
# BRBPR: Hematochezia due to bleeding diverticuli, s/p injection
and ligation during colonoscopy on [**2201-5-15**]. Did not require
blood transfusion. Challenged with heparin gtt in house and
hematocrit remained stable. Thus, coumadin restarted. Patient
completed 10 days cipro/flagyl for presumed underlying
diverticulitis.
.
# Coagulase negative staph UTI: Dirty urinalysis. Urine culture
grew oxacillin-resistant coagulase negative staph. PICC placed
to complete 7 day course of vancomycin (given CrCl, will only
need doses on [**5-26**] and [**5-28**]). Blood cultures remain no growth to
date.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: On coumadin and beta blocker. Would
restart coumadin once INR 2-2.5 (was rising on antibiotics).
.
# CRI: At baseline creatinine. NO issues.
.
# Dementia: Stable. NO issues.
.
# HTN: Controlled w/ BB alone (Toprol XL 25). Have not yet
restarted nitrate/norvasc.  Can be restarted prn at long-term
care facility.
