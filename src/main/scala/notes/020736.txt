[**2188-4-1**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3
vessel coronary disease. The LMCA had no obstructive coronary
disease. The LAD had serial 60% stenoses in the mid vessel. The
LCX had a patent stent placed previously, however, there was a
90% stenosis off of the stent into OM1. The RCA had an ulcerated
proximal lesion as well as a mid 60% stenosis as well. 2.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and
left-sided filling pressures. RA mean was 12 mm Hg, RVEDP 12 mm
Hg, PASP 40 mm Hg with a mean of 30 mm Hg. The PCWP was 18 mm Hg
and LVEDP 22 mm Hg. The cardiac output was 4.9 with an index of
2.54 l/min/m2. 3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
[**2188-4-2**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferior septum. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
[**2188-4-2**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Minimal bilateral homogeneous ICA plaque, no appreciable
stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39795**] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and
severe aortic stenosis - see result section for additional
details. Cardiac surgery was consulted and further preoperative
evaluation was performed. Echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound
were obtained. The echocardiogram confirmed severe aortic
stenosis and a carotid ultrasound found no significant disease -
see result section for additional details. He otherwise remained
stable on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for
surgery.

On [**3-3**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed an aortic valve replacement
along with coronary artery bypass grafting and Maze procedure.
For surgical details, please see operative note. Given his
inpatient stay was greater than 24 hours, Vancomycin was given
for perioperative antibiotic coverage. Following the operation,
he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. Given anemia and tachycardia, he was transfused with
packed red blood cells to improve hemodynamics and maintain
hematocrit close to 30%. He gradually weaned from Neosynephrine
and eventually transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
three. He remained in atrial fibrillation and was restarted on
Warfarin. INR was monitored closely and Warfarin was dosed for a
goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0. He remained rate controlled on
Metoprolol and Amiodarone. Over several days, he continued to
make clinical improvements with diuresis and was eventually
cleared for discharge to rehab on postoperative day six.
