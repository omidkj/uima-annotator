CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: ?ICH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old woman with OSH transfer s/p fall with reported
SAH,SDH,IPH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?ICH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 79-year-old man with outside hospital transfer,
status post fall.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no comparison. There are
multiple rounded high density areas in bilateral frontal lobes,
the biggest one measuring 3.1 x 2.4 cm, which appears to be
crossing the midline, surrounded by vasogenic edema,
representing multiple intraparenchymal hematoma or hemorrhagic
contusions. There is bifrontal subdural hematoma, measuring 5 mm
in thickness. There are high densities along the
interhemispheric fissure, sulci of bilateral temporal lobes,
representing subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is small high
density between the anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ventricles. At the site
of largest hematoma in the right frontal lobe, which appears to
be crossing the midline, the falx is slightly deviated to the
left. There is no significant ventricular dilatation. The
surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Multiple bifrontal hematomas/hemorrhagic contusions
in bilateral frontal lobes, as well as bifrontal subdural
hematoma and bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage as described
above. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage can be due to trauma given
the history, however, underlying mass lesion cannot be totally
excluded given the multiplicity and the degree of the
hemorrhage. Please correlate clinically.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

Reason: ?fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old woman with OSH transfer s/p fall with reported
SAH,SDH,IPH, A&Ox2
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?fx
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 79-year-old woman with status post fall.

C-SPINE CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no comparison. The
cervical spine was visualized from the level of skull base to
the level of T3. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
There is grade I anterolisthesis at C6/C7. There is no acute
fracture. There are degenerative changes centered at C5 and 6.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The left mastoid
air cells and left middle ear cavity is opacified. There is mild
paraseptal emphysema in the visualized portion of the lung
apices. There is mild rotation of C1/C2, which can be
positional, however, rotatory subluxation cannot be totally
excluded.

IMPRESSION: No acute fracture. Degenerative changes. Grade I
anterolisthesis at C6/C7. Opacified left mastoid air cells and
left middle ear cavity. This can be due to mastoiditis and
otitis media, however, in the traumatic setting, fracture of the
temporal bone cannot be totally excluded. Please correlate
clinically with the physical examination.
If there is a high suspicion, consider temporal bone CT.
Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 11:45PM.
The wet read was sent to ED dashboard.

WRIST(3 + VIEWS) PORT LEFT

Reason: eval fx vs lig injury

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old woman s/p fall w/ left hand pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval fx vs lig injury
INDICATION: 79-year-old woman status post fall with left hand
pain.

COMPARISON: [**2156-1-14**].

TECHNIQUE: Three views of the left wrist were obtained.

FINDINGS: The assessment is markedly limited by overlying
splint. There is generalized demineralization. There is
increased scapholunate distance, consistent with scapholunate
ligament injury. There is narrowing of radioscaphoid joint with
subchondral sclerosis. There are degenerative changes in the
first CMC, first IP, and second DIP joints. The appearance of
triquetrum bone is unchanged and no definite fracture is seen on
these limited views.

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe generalized demineralization. Assessment is markedly
limited by overlying splint.

2. Likely injury to the scapholunate ligament.

3. osteoarthritic narrowing of the radiocarpal joint.


Brief Hospital Course:
After stabilized in the Emergency Department she was admitted to
the Trauma Service and transferred to the Trauma ICU for close
monitoring. Neurosurgery, Orthopedic Spine and Plastic Surgery
were all consulted because of her injuries. None of her injures
were operative.

Neurosurgery recommendations included withholding Plavix and
Aspirin, which was a part of her home medications. She was
loaded with Dilantin and will need to continue with this for the
next 4 weeks at which time she will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] for
repeat head imaging. Her Dilantin level should be maintained at
around 15; last level checked on [**1-16**] was 14.7. There have been
no reported or observed seizure activity.

Orthopedic Spine surgery has recommended that she maintain her
cervical collar for the next 2 weeks, at which time she will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**] for flexion/extension films.

Plastic Surgery was consulted for the wrist fracture; she was
recommended to wear a gutter ulnar splint and will follow up in
2 weeks time with the Plastics/Hand Clinic. She should maintain
non weight bearing until follow up. As bone prophylaxis she was
started on Calcium and Vitamin D.

Because of her EtOH related fall she was placed on a CIWA
protocol with prn Ativan; she did not exhibit any signs of
withdrawal during her hospital stay.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended short rehab stay.
