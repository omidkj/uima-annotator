History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a 55 yo male w/ PMHx sig for metastatic renal cancer
to the thoracic spine, rheumatoid arthritis who presents as a
transfer from an OSH for leg weakness.  The patient was found to
have a renal tumor in [**2190**] s/p resection.  In [**6-21**] the patient
was found to have an extradural mass at T5 that was felt to be
metastases.  The patient is also known to have a kyphotic
collapse at T10.  The patient was seen in Dr.[**Name (NI) 2845**] office
several days ago where it was felt that the patient would need
surgical instrumentation of the thoracic spine for
stabilization.
This was scheduled for the future.  In the last couple of days,
the patient has had increased difficulty walking and numbness in
his legs.  He was seen at an OSH and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]

CT [**2194-1-22**]: IMPRESSION: Enhancing lytic mass involving the left
posterior elements of T5 with left lateral epidural extension
and near complete extension into the left T4/5 foramen.

Severe destructive changes of the T9 vertebral body and the T10
vertebral body with focal kyphosis measuring approximately 50
degrees. Approximately 2-cm anterior spondylolisthesis of T8 on
T10. This is causing severe canal stenosis and likely
compression of the cord.

High-density material seen within and around the destroyed T9
vertebral body and right posterior elements with some
well-circumscribed bony defects of the T9 body on the left.
These findings likely represent prior corpectomy with graft
material or polymethylmethacrylate placement. The lytic lesions
causing the bony destructive changes at these levels likely
represent metastases given the prior right nephrectomy.
Differential diagnostic possibility would also include myeloma.

Mild anterior wedge deformity of the T11 vertebral body.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the hospital for increasing leg weakness and
pain.  He had pain management and was readied for the OR. On
[**2194-1-28**] he went to Or where under general anesthesia he
underwent thoracic instrumented fusion T1-12.  H etolerated this
procedure well, was kept intubated and transferred to ICU post
op for close monitoring. He was extubated on POD#1.  He required
PCA pain management.  He had 2 JP drains placed intraop and
output was followed closely along with hematocrit. The first
drain was removed [**2194-1-31**] and second [**2194-2-1**] without any
difficulties. He was then transferred to the floor. Diet and
activity were advanced.  he pain was well controlled. His leg
strength improved.  He was evaluated by PT. On discharge he was
noted to have some serosangous drainage from his wound no
redness, fluid collection or edema.  His staples should stay in
an additional 7 days.
