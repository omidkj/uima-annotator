[**2160-2-7**] Cardiac catheterization with Placement of IABP
[**2160-2-8**] Aortic Valve Replacement(23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical) and

History of Present Illness:
This is a 51 year old male who presented on [**2160-1-23**] to Cape Code
Hospital with worsening shortness of breath.
.
He was in his usual state of health until 23 days prior to
admission when he developed dyspnea and cough. He saw a
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 83602**] and was started on Torsemide for
heart failure. A few days prior to admission, he saw a Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 65453**] (pulmonologist), who prescribed Symbicort. The day prior
to admission, he had a CT chest that yielded bilateral
parenchymal disease, pleural effusions and adenopathy. He was
referred to the ED. He was given nebs and Doxycylcine and sent
home. Thereafter he developed SOB with the slightest exertion,
[**3-14**] pillow orthopnea, pink frothy sputum and difficulty
sleeping. He returned to [**Hospital3 **] the following morning.
.
In [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital, [**Doctor Last Name **] underwent bronchoscopy which
revealed only "reactive bronchial cells and mixed inflammatory
cells". Gram stain negative and there were no malignant cells. A
PPD was planted, negative. On [**2160-1-30**] he had a wedge biopsy by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30119**]. On direct visualization there were "antracotic
changes and some interstitial changes with mainly noncompliant
lung". A chest tube was placed. The biopsy read was
"desquamative interstial pneumonitis". This biopsy was sent to
[**Hospital1 2177**] for a second opinion from Dr.[**Last Name (un) 90142**]. The patient,
frustrated by poor doctor communication and staffing, requested
transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**].

[**2160-2-4**] CHEST CT: 1. Progression of the underlying ground-glass
and consolidative abnormality, predominantly in the right lung
relative to [**1-22**]. Much of this is probably pulmonary
edema. The remainder, including the more nodular consolidative
lesions is a pulmonary process, particularly hemorrhage, since
some of it resolved, and some worsened. If there is some primary
lung disease, vasculitis could explain the presumed hemorrhage,
but I do not see why it should have resolved so clearly in one
area (LLL) and worsened so considerably in most of the right
lung.
2. Stable relatively small layering nonhemorrhagic pleural
effusions. No
other intrathoracic or chest wall collections.
3. Probable calcific aortic stenosis. Mitral valve function
should also be
assessed. New mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
4. Central adenopathy, probably related to pulmonary
abnormality, could be
reactive, and at least the AP window node has less edema.
.
[**2160-2-6**] TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic function may
be depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.] There
with moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Extensive simple atherosclerotic plaque in the descending
thoracic aorta down to 48 cm from the incisors. There aortic
valve leaflets (?#) are moderately thickened with reduced
excursion consistent with aortic stenosis. No aortic valve
vegetation or abscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
large vegetation involving both leaflets with perforation/hole
in the anterior mitral leaflet. No mitral valve abscess. Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid valve is normal
with trivial tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonic valve is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2160-2-7**] Cardiac Catheterization: Coronary angiography in this
right dominant system revealed no angiographically apparrent
CAD.  The LMCA, LAD, Cx and RCA were angiographically normal.
Severe Mitral Stenosis. Moderate Aortic Stenosis. Successfull
placement of IABP.

Brief Hospital Course:
Initially admitted with the presumed diagnosis of desquamative
interstial pneumonitis per [**Hospital3 **] Hospital based on pathology
from wedge biopsy. Pulmonary was consulted who advised repeat CT
scan and review of the outside slides. Repeat CT scan showed
progression of the ground glass opacities and consolidative
process concerning for pulmonary edema. Review of the pathology
slides from OSH showed bland hemorrhage that was not entirely
consistent with a primary pulmonary process. Patient was tapered
off steroids and cardiac evaluation was pursued to explain
pulmonary hemorrhage. He underwent TTE which did not show signs
of systolic failure, but did show functional mitral stenosis,
some
