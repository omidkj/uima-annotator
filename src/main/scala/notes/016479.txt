Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
aspiration, seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 87 yo Spanish Speaking woman with dementia
(requiring [**Hospital 4820**] nursing care), diabetes II, CHF, atrial
fibrillation who presented to the ED yesterday with seizure like
activity in the setting of recent failure to thrive. Her family
noted a gradual decline over the last few weeks with
lethargy/increased confusion, decreased PO intake, diarrhea last
week, no vomiting or fevers. She was also more confused than
normal (baseline does not know where she is, doesn't hold a
coherent conversation), no headaches, no vomiting, no dyspnea,
chest pains. She last spoke around 1430 and then was being fed
dinner and doing poorly when she dropped the fork from her left
hand and began shaking the left arm. EMS was called, upon
arrival EMS noted the patient to have L-sided posturing (and
enroute L arm shaking for a few seconds/posturing to left side,
eyes rolled back) and she was vomiting.

Past Medical History:

Social History:
lives at rehab x 7 months, family decided to move her there as
she was unable to walk and she was becoming more
combative/aggressive, no h/o smoking but did use chewing tobacco
'her whole life' until 2 years ago, no etoh or illicit drugs,

IMAGING
CT pelvis/abdomen-5/5-1. No definite evidence of intra-abdominal
acute process.
2. Moderate right basilar atelectasis. Please note, aspiration
or early pneumonia is difficult to exclude given this
appearance.
3. Cardiomegaly and coronary artery calcification.
4. Small hiatal hernia.
.
CT head [**5-21**]-No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of major
vascular territorial infarct. Chronic microvascular disease.
.
MRI head [**5-23**]-
1. No evidence of acute infarction. Multiple FLAIR hyperintense
foci in the cerebral white matter, pons, on both sides, most
likely representing sequela of chronic small vessel occlusive
disease, givent he aptient's age and risk factors.
2. Prominent ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces most likely
due to age- appropriate parenchymal volume loss. However,
superimposed Alzheimer's dementia cannot be excluded, given the
mild dilation of the temporal horns and small hippocampi.
3. Small linear focus of enhancement in the left occipital lobe,
seen only on the MPRAGE sequences, could represent a small
developmental venous anomaly. However, dedicated mr angiogram
was not performed on the present study. This can be considered
based on clinical discretion.
.
EEG [**5-22**]-Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized
background and bursts of generalized slowing. These findings
indicate a
widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and

subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and

infection are among the most common causes. There were no areas
of
prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features

.
Echo-[**5-23**]-Possible small mitral valve vegetation. Normal global
and regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate aortic
regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-10-8**],
severity of valvular regurgitation has increased slightly.
Pulmonary pressures are higher. The other findings are similar.
A transesophageal study may better be able to assess the mitral
valve morphology.
.
CXR's
[**5-21**]:The endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3 cm from the
carina. Patient rotation somewhat limits interpretation. Lung
volumes are low, but pulmonary vasculature does not appear
engorged. There is no evidence of pleural effusion. No focal
parenchymal opacities are seen in the lungs. The cardiac size,
mediastinum and hila cannot be fully evaluated due to patient
rotation.
[**5-23**]:AP single view with patient in semi-erect sitting position
demonstrates patient in semi-oblique position towards the right.
The Dobbhoff line is seen and apparently has not passed the
hiatus. Otherwise, there is no evidence of any new abnormality,
but as before, pulmonary vascular congestion is present and the
lateral pleural sinuses are blunted.
IMPRESSION: Unsuccessful advancement of Dobbhoff line finding
resistance in hiatal area.
[**5-30**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
considerable patient rotation. The endotracheal tube,
nasogastric tube and central venous access line right have been
removed. The lung volumes are slightly smaller than before,
there is unchanged mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions
and signs suggesting mild volume overload. Retrocardiac
atelectasis is unchanged. There is no evidence of newly appeared
parenchymal opacities.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo woman with dementia, DM, atrial fibrillation, CHF who
presented with lethargy/altered mental status, witnessed to have
a possible seizure, and admitted to the ICU after intubation.
.
# Altered mental status/seizure: EEG showed widespread
encephalopathy, CT was negative for acute pathology.  Per pt's
family, pt has a history of seizure in setting of urosepsis. A
full infections work up was performed. She was initially on
Ceftriaxone/Ampicillin and Acyclovir for concern for meningitis.
Ceftriaxone/ Ampicillin/Acyclovir were discontinued. An LP was
not suggestive of bacterial or viral infection, HSV negative.
Blood cultures were negative, only [**2-19**] coag nesg staph (positive
from the same set) that was likely contaminant. Prior to
speciation, she was on Vancomycin f
