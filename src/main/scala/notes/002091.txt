Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
admission prior to percutaneous AVR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2184-1-13**]
1. Percutaneous aortic valve replacement with a 29-mm
    [**Company 1543**] CoreValve device, model number MCS-P3-943,
    serial number [**Serial Number 87703**].
2. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
3. Ascending aortography.


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M with critical AS s/p balloon valvuloplasty [**4-29**], NYHA stage
IV diastolic CHF, CAD s/p CABG [**2167**], tachy-brady s/p PPM [**4-28**],
and CKD stage III (baseline Cr 2.2) admitted electively prior to
percutaneous AVR scheduled for Tues [**1-13**]. He has been having
progressive dyspnea on exertion and can only walk a few steps
before having to rest. He has no anginal symptoms. He has had
worsening leg edema, orthopnea (sleeps in recliner), cough
productive of clear sputum. No PND, fevers, chills, weight loss,
fatigue, poor appetite, palpitations. He reports that his
symptoms are currently "much worse" than before his
valvuloplasty in [**2181**].
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is resting comfortably, no SOB,
does have CP in L sternum from a fall in the bathroom earlier
this week (reproducible, not worse with inspiration, currently
[**12-1**] and improved from initial trauma).
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. Cardiac review of systems is notable for
absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope or
presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
[**2184-1-14**] Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. An aortic
CoreValve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients. Mild to moderate ([**11-23**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen with an anterior perivalvular leak and
minimal posterior jet of aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Well seated aortic CoreValve prosthesis with normal
gradient. Mild-moderate perivalvular aortic regurgitation. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2179**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
[**Age over 90 **]M with critical AS s/p balloon valvuloplasty [**4-29**], NYHA stage
IV diastolic CHF, CAD s/p CABG [**2167**], tachy-brady s/p PPM [**4-28**],
and CKD stage III (baseline Cr 2.2) admitted electively prior to
percutaneous AVR scheduled for Tues [**1-13**].
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Aortic stenosis: Critical AS s/p balloon valvuloplasty [**4-29**],
NYHA stage IV diastolic CHF. Symptoms progressing since
valvuloplasty now with severe limitation of function. Poor
surgical candidate given age and prior CABG. Pt admitted for
percutaneous AVR. Pt diuresed gently with lasix given preload
dependence. Csurg was consulted and pre-op workup with panorex,
UA/UCx, etc was completed. On hospital day 2, pt had flash
pulmonary edema as lasix was held in the am. He was transferred
to the CCU after morphine, lasix bolus, and on a non-rebreather.
He was given diuril and lasix gtt, and produced good UOP. He was
transitioned from CPAP to high-flow neb, and able to tolerate.
On hospital day 3, he was taken for core valve.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG in [**2167**], has stable coronary artery and graft
disease on cath in [**10-30**] (prox Cx 100% stenosis, prox RCA 100%
stenosis, all grafts widely patent. LIMA to first Diagonal, SVG
to OM, SVG to first RPL, SVG to RPDA). Pt's EKG's were
unchanged, and pt had no chest pain during the admission. He was
continued on ASA 81mg.
.
# Acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction due to
aortic stenosis: Last EF 55-60% ([**2182**]). Pt is currently in stage
IV diastolic CHF with severe limitation of function. Pt
presented with fluid overload on exam and by CXR. He was given
cautious diuresis initially. However, as above, pt had flash
pulmonary edema, and required transfer to CCU overnight for
brief use of CPAP, and diuresis with lasix and diuril.
He was maintained on a fluid restricted, low sodium diet.
.
# Tachy-brady s/p PPM [**4-28**]: EP evaluation and interrogation of
ICD/PPM to determnine whether it needs to be suppressed during
the valve procedure, which will involve rapid right ventricular
pacing (up to 200 bpm) during balloon valvuloplasty and 110 BPM
during valve placement. EP interrogated pacer and followed
throughout hospital course.
.
# Stage III CKD: Baseline Cr 2.2. His Cr was monitored, and was
2.1 prior to core valve replacement.
.
# HTN: Well-controlled on admission, with brief hypertension in
setting of flash pulmonary edema. He was diuresed as above.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
# GERD: Continued on omeprazole.
.
# BPH: Continued doxazosin.
.
Brief CCU course: Patient was transferred to the CCU on a
non-rebreather in severe respiratory distress and impending
respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema,
confirmed by chest xray imaging. He was started on Bipap with
improvement in his oxygenation and ventilation. His foley
catheter became displaced during transfer necessitating removal
and replacement with coude catheter with subsequent mild
hematuria. The patient was diuresed with diuril and a lasix gtt
once his catheter was in proper postion
