History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old man with history of chronic renal
insufficiency, long standing hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Location (un) 620**]. Patient presented to OSH when
family called EMS after finding him down in his residence.
.
History obtained from patient, his sister and his daughter. Mr
[**Known lastname **] believes he got up to use the restroom sometime during

that same night.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the

CT HEAD [**2175-2-21**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
.
Cardiac Cath  [**2175-2-22**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Consult CTS for CABG.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2175-2-23**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful placement of IABP with 1:1 augmentation.
2- Mildly elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures with
preserved cardiac output.
.
Carotid U/S [**2-21**]
IMPRESSION: 40-59% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries
bilaterally.
This is a baseline examination at the [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Left femoral U/S [**2-25**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
.
Abd U/S [**2-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly limited evaluation of the aorta due to overlying
bowel gas.
Cannot determine flow through the aneurysmal portion of the
aorta.
2. Approximately 4 cm lesion along the lower pole of the left
kidney
concerning for a solid mass. Diagnostic considerations include
hyperdense
cyst. Further evaluation can be achieved via MRI or
contrast-enhanced CT.
.
Renal U/S [**2-28**]
IMPRESSION: Solid-appearing left exophytic kidney mass.
As noted on the non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis, this
can be further characterized with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI on
a non-emergent basis.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Infrarenal abdominal aortic dilatation measuring up to 4.1
cm. No
evidence of rupture. Narrowing of origin of SMA, and left renal
arterial
stent, by atherosclerotic calcification.
3. Approximately 4 cm exophytic lesion along the lower pole of
the left
kidney, concerning for solid mass or hyperdense cyst. Further
evaluation can
be achieved via contrast-enhanced CT or MRI.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
associated
atelectasis.
5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
.
CHEST PA/LAT: [**3-1**]
Preliminary Report !! WET READ !!
Interval development of bilateral effusions, moderate on the
left since
the16th. Left lower lobe opacity persists and remains concerning
for
developing pneumonia.
.
TTE [**2175-2-28**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akine
