SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone at home.  He denies

V.A. system.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  His temperature was 99.9
with a blood pressure of 166/80, heart rate 98, respiratory
rate 34.  Oxygen saturation was 90% on room air, 100% on
nonrebreather.  General:  This is an elderly male appearing
his stated age in moderate distress.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Mucus
membranes moist.  No meningismus.  Patient noted to have
bilateral crackles one-half the way up.  He had a regular
rate and rhythm, S1, S2.  He had a [**1-26**] crescendo-decrescendo
murmur that was systolic.  Abdomen soft, non-tender,
non-distended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Patient noted to have
1+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Extremities were warm and dry.
No rashes were apparent.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White count 10, hematocrit 32,
platelet count 311,000.  Sodium 132, potassium 5.2, chloride
92, bicarb 33, BUN 51, creatinine 1.4, glucose 347.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Given the patient's significant dyspnea on Emergency
Department admission patient was given Lasix 40 mg IV,
started on nitroglycerin drip and was given nonrebreather
followed by CPAP but became agitated and sats remained
suboptimal.  The patient was emergently intubated in the
Emergency Department for respiratory failure.  Chest film
obtained in the Emergency Department was consistent with
congestive heart failure.  The patient was transferred to the
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for management of presumed
congestive heart failure.  Patient was also begun on empiric
antibiotics given high level of suspicion for pneumonia given
the patient's fever and productive cough.  The patient was
begun on levofloxacin as well as vancomycin given his history
of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Patient was
aggressively diuresed, however, remained febrile with
increasing secretions.  His initial sputum culture as well as
blood culture grew out MRSA and patient was continued on
vancomycin which was begun on the [**11-25**].  The patient
was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the [**11-27**] for further management.  MICU course was notable for
significant improvement in his respiratory status with
ongoing diuresis and antibiotics as well as frequent chest PT
and frequent nebs.  The patient was successfully extubated on
the [**11-28**].  The patient initially required significant
oxygen via nasal cannula but was progressively weaned to
minimal oxygen via nasal cannula.  The patient defervesced
while in the Intensive Care Unit and remained afebrile for
several days prior to discharge from the Intensive Care Unit
on the [**12-3**].  Over that time his white blood cell
count also decreased significantly.  After discharge the
patient was weaned off oxygen via nasal cannula to the point
where he was requiring only one liter of oxygen via nasal
cannula.  He was able to ambulate 40 feet prior to discharge
with a room air saturation in the 86-95% range while
ambulating.

2.  Congestive heart failure.  As mentioned above the patient
was aggressively diuresed and initially received intravenous
Lasix and was switched to a p.o. regimen on the [**12-1**].  The patient's p.o. Lasix was increased from 80 mg
p.o. q. day to 80 b.i.d.  The patient was noted to have
improving congestive heart failure but was noted to still
have some failure on physical examination through the [**12-7**].  The patient underwent repeat echocardiogram on the
[**11-24**] which demonstrated severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis as well as distal anterolateral and
basal inferoseptal walls that contract the best.  No discrete
left ventricular thrombus was seen.  Right ventricular cavity
was mildly dilated with inferior wall hypokinesis.  When
compared with a prior study of [**2159-9-22**] the patient's
left ventricular systolic function was more depressed and
patient appeared to have a higher level of pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.  His ejection fraction was estimated
to be between 20 and 25%.

3.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.
Patient was noted to have MRSA bacteremia on admission.
Subsequent blood cultures were negative after the initiation
of vancomycin.  Patient was also noted to have MRSA urinary
tract infection on admission as well as MRSA positive sputum
culture as mentioned above.  Given the concern for
endocarditis as a possible source of his MRSA bacteremia,
patient underwent initially transthoracic echocardiogram and
later transesophageal echocardiography on the [**10-7**].
The transesophageal echocardiogram did not demonstrate any
evidence of vegetation in his cardiac valves.  As mentioned
before, the patient defervesced while in the Intensive Care
Unit and remained afebrile for several days prior to
discharge and had a white count that decreased from 10 on
admission to 8.3 on the day prior to discharge.

4.  Acute cholecystic hepatitis.  Patient was noted to have
an elevated alkaline phosphatase while in the Intensive Care
Unit that had elevated from his admission level of 760 to a
maximum of 1375 on the [**10-2**].  This was ac
