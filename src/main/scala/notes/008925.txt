History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with PMH significant for diastolic heart
failure, pulmonary hypertension and stage III CKD who presented
from an outside hospital with respiratory distress, chest pain,
fever, chills and cough.  He states he had been feeling ill for
about one week with increasing difficulty breathing while at
home.

At the outside hospital, he was treated with both Lasix and a
nitroglycerin drip.  He was admitted to the intensive care unit
at [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.


Past Medical History:
Stage III chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 2.1)
Cystinuria with a history of heavy stone burden (on longstanding
penicillamine until 3 yrs ago)
Cutis laxa secondary to penicillamine
[**Last Name (un) 4584**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome (thought to be secondary to
penicillamine)
Restrictive cardiomyopathy (diastolic CHF)
Pulmonary hypertension
Atrial flutter s/p AV node ablation (with postprocedure complete
heart block requiring pacemaker placement)
Pancreatic low grade, benign mucinous cystic neoplasm (LGBMC)

restless leg syndrome
GERD

Social History:
Works as a software engineer.  Is married with no children.
Denies any smoking or drug history; uses rare alcohol.


Family History:
Several second-degree relatives with DM2.

Physical Exam:
Gen - awake, alert, NAD, no use of accessory muscles
HEENT - OP clear
Neck - Difficult to assess JVP given thickened neck; appears
nml.
CVS - RRR, no noted m/r/g
Lungs - Decreased BS bilat w/ mild rales throughout lung fields

Abd - soft, NT/ND.
Ext - no LE edema b/l

Pertinent Results:
CXR - [**2198-1-7**]: There is a new airspace consolidation involving
the left lung (mostly upper) consistent with pneumonia. The
right lung is grossly unremarkable. A dual-lead pacemaker is
seen with leads overlying the right atrium and right ventricle,
unchanged since [**2197-10-25**]. There is no pneumothorax.

CXR - [**2198-1-9**]:  A new airspace opacity has developed in the
right lower lobe since the prior day. However, there has been
considerable improvement in left upper and medial left lower
lobe opacities. There are no effusions or pneumothorax. The
heart is normal in size. Mediastinal contours are unchanged. A
dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device is again noted.

RENAL ULTRASOUND: Multiple cysts are seen within bilateral
kidneys, the largest of which is located on the right and
measures greater than 16 cm. Note is made of fullness of the
right renal collecting system, similar to CT from [**2197-5-26**].
The bladder is normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 58 yo man with PMH significant for a h/o HTN, diastolic
CHF, pulm HTN who initially presented from [**Hospital3 3765**] in
respiratory distress w/ evidence of pneumonia on CXR along w/
pulm edema.
.
# Resp distress/pneumonia: The patient was originally admitted
to the intensive care unit given his level of respiratory
distress.  On admission, it was felt his shortness of breath was
most likely due to pneumonia seen on CXR along w/ component of
CHF especially given response to nitro gtt and Lasix while at
[**Hospital3 **].  The patient also had AFib with RVR while in
the intensive care unit, which was treated with IVF
resuscitation.  The patient was also treated with CTX/azithro
for a community acquired pneumonia.  He had a negative DFA for
influenza.  He did not require intubation for his breathing, but
initially did need a non-rebreather while in the unit.  He was
maintained on nasal cannula while on the floor, with his oxygen
requirement lessening each day, until he did not require oxygen
while at rest.  His ambulatory saturation did hover around
88-90% so he was sent home with portable oxygen until he is
fully recovered from his pneumonia.

He was discharged to complete a course of oral antibiotics to
treat his community acquired pneumonia.
.
# Cardiac:
A. Pump: The patient has a h/o diastolic CHF. He appeared to
have component of failure contributing to resp status above
given response to treatment of CHF which was likely contributed
to by AFib w/ RVR.  He was treated with Lasix and beta-blcokade
as needed.  He did require one additional dose of Lasix the
morning after he was called out of the unit, but was then
maintained on his home regimen without incident.  His captopril
was held throughout this admission given his acute on chronic
renal failture.  He was advised to restart his captopril at
[**Hospital3 **].
.
B. Rhythm: Pt w/ h/o paroxysmal AFib and is not on coumadin due
to problems w/ epistaxis. The patient was originally maintained
on telemetry after leaving the ICU.  After remaining in sinus
for >24 hours, telemetry was discontinued.  He remained in NSR
after IVF resuscitation and resolution of fever.
.
C. Cor: The patient has no h/o CAD. He did have a slight
troponin leak which was felt to be consistent with demand
ischemia.  He was briefly on a heparin gtt, which was rapidly
discontinued.  He was discharged to resume his ACE-I.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient had an elevated Cr
to 3.4 from baseline 2.1 which was likely due to infection. The
patient was given IVF in the ED & ICU. He appeared euvolemic
with mild pulmonary edema. His creatinine improved to his
baseline.  The patient was continued on his sevelamer and
calcitriol.
.
# HTN: The patient was continued on his outpt Lasix dose.  He
was advised to restart his captopril and eplerenone after
[**Hospital3 **].
.
# Hyperuricosuria: The patient was continued on his allopurinol.

.
# Restless leg: The patient was continued on his outpatient
doses of Neurontin, Requip and oxycontin.
.
