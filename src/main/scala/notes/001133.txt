CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Disabling leg claudication, left greater
than right.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
nondiabetic white female with hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, mesenteric ischemia, status post
mesenteric artery bypass in [**2154-7-8**] complicated by
respiratory failure, pleural effusions, esophageal
Candidiasis, and gallbladder disease requiring gallbladder
decompression and anorexia requiring the placement of a PEG,
complained of severe, disabling bilateral claudication and
left foot rest pain.

The patient had outpatient arteriogram which showed
aortoiliac disease.  However, because of the patient's
pulmonary disease and recent postoperative complications
following mesenteric artery bypass an axillobifemoral bypass
graft was recommended.  The patient had no ulcerations on her
feet.

11. Anorexia requiring the placement of a PEG in [**2154-8-8**] hospitalization.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former cigarette smoker,

roommate.  She ambulates independently.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Pulse 85,
blood pressure 184/85, height 5' 2", weight 132 pounds.
General:  The patient was an alert, cooperative, frail white
female, mildly dyspneic on ambulation to examination room.
HEENT:  The pupils were equal and round.  The sclerae were
anicteric.  Neck:  Range of motion was within normal limits.
No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Chest:  Lungs were clear
bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur.
Abdomen:  Bowel sounds present.  Mild tenderness in the
epigastric area at the proximal pole of the surgical incision
with some hypertrophy and puckering noted.  Rectal:
Deferred.  Extremities:  No ankle edema.  Right first toenail
absent.  Left foot ruborous without ulceration.  Pulse
examination:  Femoral pulses diminished bilaterally.  Distal
pulses nonpalpable.  Neurologic:  Nonfocal.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On [**2155-7-8**], WBC 11.6,
hemoglobin 12.5, hematocrit 39.2, platelets 360,000.  PT
12.7, PTT 24.8, INR 1.1.  Sodium 147, potassium 4.0, chloride
107, bicarbonate 20, BUN 29, creatinine 1.2, glucose 96.

EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70.  Normal
tracing compared to previous tracing of [**2154-9-17**].

Chest x-ray showed no acute pulmonary disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2155-7-16**] following an uneventful right axillary artery to
right common femoral bypass and right femoral to left common
femoral bypass with PTFE graft.  At the end of surgery, the
patient had warm feet with Dopplerable right pedal pulses and
no Doppler signals in the left pedal pulse initially but
within several hours Doppler signals were found.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was transferred
from the VICU to a floor bed.  Later that same evening, the
patient had two episodes of nausea and vomiting.  She
complained of epigastric pain.  EKGs were normal.  She was
kept n.p.o.  Her heart rate was approximately 115 and was
treated with IV Lopressor.  The patient's hematocrit was
found to be 26 after having been 32 on postoperative day
number one.  She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood
cells.  She was started on IV heparin and IV nitroglycerin.

Her second set of cardiac isoenzymes were positive and she
was transferred to the SICU for treatment of her evolving
myocardial infarction.

The Cardiology Service started the patient on Imdur,
Lopressor, and hydralazine which was then changed to an ACE
inhibitor.  The goal heart rate was 60 and goal systolic
blood pressure was 115-125.  The patient was continued on
heparin.  The patient continued to have several more episodes
of nausea and vomiting without any EKG changes.  This was
thought to be continued demand ischemia.  Persantine MIBI
study was planned; however, because of repeated episodes of
nausea, the patient was taken for a cardiac catheterization
on [**2155-7-21**].  Catheterization showed one vessel coronary
artery disease, preserved ventricular function with an
ejection fraction of 55%, a successful PTCA/drug eluding
stent of the midcircumflex was placed and a PTCA of OM1.

Cardiology also recommended starting Zestril 5 mg q.d. if the
patient's systolic blood pressure continued to be higher than
130 on Lopressor, Captopril, and Imdur.

The patient's left hand became somewhat cooler following
cardiac catheterization and revealed the left brachial
artery.  Heparin was continued to prevent thrombosis during
arterial vasospasm.  The arm was also edematous since the
patient had gained 10 kilograms postoperatively in fluid.
The patient's hematocrit was noted to be 28 and she was
transfused 1 more unit of packed red blood cells.  The
patient returned to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 9 from the Postcatheterization Unit
on [**2155-7-23**].  Her hand was somewhat warmer.  She had a
triphasic left ulnar pulse and a biphasic left radial pulse.
The IV heparin was stopped.

Physical Therapy consult was requested for full weightbearing
ambulation.  Short-term cardiac rehabilitation was
recommended.

At the time of dictation, the patient's incisions are clean,
dry, and intact.  She has Doppler signals of her axillo and
femoral-femoral grafts.  Her pedal pulses are all
Dopplerable.  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], covering
for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], in one weeks time or per further
instructions at the time of discharge.
