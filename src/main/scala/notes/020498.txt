Admission Date:  [**2102-2-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2102-2-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2025-7-13**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiology, [**Hospital1 **] Hospital

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Palpitations.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  She is a 76-year-old female
with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, status post
alcohol, septal ablation in [**8-4**] at the [**Hospital1 18**];  history of MI
and pulmonary hypertension, who presented to the [**Hospital6 10443**] on [**2102-1-27**] after noting left precordial chest pain
associated with shortness of breath and palpitations, three
days prior to admission to the outside hospital.  There, the
patient was found to be in new-onset atrial fibrillation with
EKGs revealing LVH with strain pattern and ischemia could not
be ruled out at the time.  Given her history of atrial
fibrillation, unstable angina, the patient was started on IV
nitroglycerin, IV heparin and was rate controlled with beta
blockers and remained chest pain free thereafter.  The
patient's cardiac enzymes revealed a CK of 277, MB of 2.0,
troponin of 0.57.  Chest x-ray was negative for CHF, positive
for cardiomegaly.  A V/Q scan was done, given her shortness
of breath and was low probability for PE.

Echocardiogram was also performed, which revealed:
1.  Mild asymmetric left ventricular septal hypertrophy with
systolic anterior motion of the anterior leaflet with
moderate outflow tract obstruction.
2.  Dilated left atrium.
3.  Fibrocalcification of the mitral valve apparatus.
4.  Aortic stenosis.
5.  1+ TR.
6.  Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.

The patient was transitioned from heparin to Coumadin with
INR range 4.0, per nursing home.  They were holding Coumadin
times two days.  When the patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**], she
was asymptomatic with much less pain, mild wheezing, no
nausea or vomiting, no diaphoresis.  She had one episode of
mild chest pain and no further episodes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for:
1.  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, status post septal ablation
in [**2100-8-2**] with alcohol.
2.  History of  hypertension.
3.  History of hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Status post vertebral/T4 osteoporosis.
5.  History of COPD.
6.  Asthma.
7.  History of MI.
8.  History of left hip dislocation.
9.  History of pulmonary hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vitals:  Temperature 96.8; pulse 97;
blood pressure 110/70.  The patient was saturating at 94
percent on room air.  The patient was generally in no acute
distress, pleasant.  Her HEENT was normocephalic, atraumatic.
Extraocular movements were intact.  Oropharynx was clear with
no lymphadenopathy, no JVD.  Heart was irregularly irregular,
a III/VI systolic murmur throughout her precordium with
radiation to the neck as well as axilla.  Abdomen has good
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended ...........
Extremities:  Free of any clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Neurologically, cranial nerves II to XII were intact.
Strength was [**6-7**] throughout.  Reflexes were symmetric and
toes were downgoing.

DATA ON ADMISSION:  Include white count 9,300, hematocrit
31.0, platelet count 277,000, INR 3.6, PT 23.2, sodium 140,
potassium 4.8, chloride 102, bicarbonate 32, BUN 41,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 122, magnesium 2.4, calcium 8.7,
phosphorus 3.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  As follows:

1.  The patient was admitted for atrial fibrillation.  The
patient was maintained on Coumadin as well as metoprolol.
The patient was ruled out for an MI.  Her chest x-ray was not
consistent with CHF.  On telemetry, the patient continued to
have rapid atrial fibrillation with rates greater than 100.
During these episodes, the patient would have shortness of
breath.  Her metoprolol was continued to be increased but the
patient was still very poorly rate controlled.  The patient
was continued on Coumadin with good INR.  For the patient's
HOCM, the patient was maintained on good preload.  She was
prevented from being dehydrated and her eyes and nose were
................ daily.  The goal was to keep the patient
................ and slightly positive.  The patient would
have episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation, she would have
worsening dyspnea and shortness of breath, as well as chest
pain.  For each episode of chest pain, EKGs were performed,
which were unchanged.  The patient never had an enzyme leak
and hence it was felt that these episodes of chest pain were
consistent with worsening of her outflow tract obstruction
secondary to tachycardic rate.  Hence it was decided that the
patient should undergo alcohol septal ablation.  The patient
was thus sent to the CCU where the patient underwent an
alcohol septal ablation on [**2102-2-15**].  After the patient had
her alcohol septal ablation she had a cardiac catheterization
which revealed normal coronaries, normal ventricular
function, severe HOCM, successful ethanol ablation of S4,
persistent left SVC draining into coronary sinus.  The
patient had an echo prior to undergoing alcohol septal
ablation which revealed the following:
following:
a.  An ejection fraction of greater than 75 percent.
b.  Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and systolic function of greater than 55
percent.
c.  Systolic anterior motion of the anterior valve leaflets
with severe resting left outflow tract obstruction.
d.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were
normal.
e.  Mild 1+ AR, mitral valve leaflets were mild thickened,
moderate 3+ MR.

The patient tolerated the alcohol septal ablation without
complications.  She was then transferred to the Cardiology
Floor two days post procedure.  Her management post procedure
was fairly uncomplicated.  Her metoprolol was titrated up
slowly in an effort to maintain good beta blockade.  Repeat
EKGs, post procedure, revealed that the patient continued to
remain in sinus rhythm with first-degree AV block.  She
tolerated increased titrations in her beta blocker with good
affect.  Her pulse by discharge was in the 60s to 70s with no
tachycardia on ambulation.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The patient was
maintained on medications and MDIs and the goal was to keep
her saturations at around 90 percent.  The patient did have
some evidence of volume overload post alcohol septal
ablation.  She was managed with gentle diuresis, using
initially 10 mg of IV Lasix q.d. and by date of discharge was
on 20 mg of p.o. Lasix with good affect.  The goal was to
keep patient only slightly negative, given her history of
HOCM.  The patient was also on a prednisone taper and was to
continue this taper outpatient.

3.  Coronary artery disease.  The patient was continued on a
beta blocker.  Her aspirin was discontinued given that she
was on Coumadin.  The patient was continued on her Coumadin
with goal INR between 2.0 and 3.0.  For FCM the patient was
maintained on a cardiac diet.

4.  Infectious disease.  The patient had some low-grade
temperatures of 99.2 to 99.6.  Urine cultures, blood cultures
were sent off which were negative to no growth by time of
discharge.  The patient did not have any evidence of left
shift on CBC.  Additionally, she did not have any cough.
Chest x-rays revealed a mild fluid overload with no discrete
infiltrate noted.   The patient was thus managed without
antibiotic treatment, as she had no focal source of
infection.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.  She is stable on room air to 1.0
liter of oxygen.  She is ambulating without assistance.  She
is doing all her ADLs without assistance.  The patient is
tolerating a cardiac diet.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  She will be discharged to a skilled
nursing facility.
