Service:  CV MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
female, with a past medical history significant for
metastatic breast carcinoma with stable metastases to the
lung, as demonstrated on a CT scan in [**11/2111**], who presents
with a 1-month history of progressive dyspnea on exertion.
She also states that she has shortness of breath at rest, and
reports mild chest pressure with exertion and at rest.  She
also reports bilateral lower extremity edema increasing over
the last 1 month.  For work-up of this, her primary care
provider had the patient undergo a cardiac stress test on
[**2112-2-2**] which was negative for reversible perfusion
defects.  However, the patient did experience atrial
fibrillation at that time.  She also did have an
echocardiogram done on [**2112-2-4**], which showed a
moderate pericardial effusion which had increased slightly
since her previous echo.  The patient denied any symptoms
suggestive of lightheadedness or syncope.  She denies fevers
and cough.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. New atrial fibrillation.
2. Pericardial effusion status post echo [**2112-2-4**],
which showed moderate pericardial effusion, no tamponade
physiology, ejection fraction of 60%, mild MR, moderate TR.
3. History of metastatic breast cancer, status post CT in
[**2111-11-23**] which showed stable lung metastases, and at
that time stable pericardial effusion.
4. Status post Persantine-MIBI [**2112-2-2**], which
showed no reversible perfusion defects.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency, status post nephrectomy.
6. Hypertension.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. Hypercholesterolemia.
9. Gout.
10.Glaucoma.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Levoxyl.
2. Allopurinol.
3. Amaryl.
4. Arimidex.
5. Avandia.
6. Colace.
7. Iron.
8. Folate.
9. Protonix.
10.Lipitor.
11.Vitamin B12.
12.Norvasc.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco or alcohol.  She
lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 86**].  She does have a daughter
in [**Name (NI) 86**] who is involved in her care.  The patient does have
stressors at home, including her husband who has bipolar
disease longstanding.

VITALS ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.6, blood pressure
127/56, pulse 70, respiratory rate 22, satting 100% on 2
liters.
HEENT:  Her extraocular movements were intact.  Her
oropharynx was clear.
NECK:  She had JVD to the midneck.
CHEST:  She had bilateral crackles, left greater than right.
CARDIAC EXAM:  She was irregularly irregular with a II/VI
harsh systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  2+ edema.  Of note, she had no pulses paradoxus
on exam.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 4.4, hematocrit 33.7,
platelets 198.  Her chem-7 was normal.  She had a UA which
was negative.  Chest x-ray showed right heart border was
obscured with possible infiltrate.  EKG was irregular with
poor R wave progression, which was new.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for pericardial
drain procedure.  She went to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory where under fluoro guidance she had a
pericardiocentesis and drain placement, and 450 cc of
straw-colored fluid was removed.  Micro on pericardial fluid
was negative.  However, cytology was still pending.

The patient did have follow-up echocardiogram.  Her systolic
function was normal with an LV-EF of 55%.  Ventricular wall
thickness and cavity size were also normal.  She still had
moderate TR.  She also had mild to moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension, and she showed only a small
pericardial effusion.  No tamponade.  This echo was performed
after her pericardial drain was pulled.

A total of approximately 460 cc of pericardial fluid was
collected in the drain post her pericardiocentesis for a
total of approximately 900 cc of straw-colored fluid removed.
Her drain was pulled 24 hours after placement.

The patient was sent to the CCU for observation post
pericardial drain placement.  There, she did have atrial
fibrillation.  Coumadin therapy was not started secondary to
her known metastatic disease.  The patient also had a
temperature to 101.  This was most likely attributable to her
right infiltrate which was seen on her admission chest x-ray,
and she was started on Levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia.
She will complete a 7-day course of Levofloxacin.  The
patient did not spike any further fevers after that initial
temperature of 101.

The patient also had increasing oxygen requirement during the
end of her hospital stay.  It was believed this was secondary
to pneumonia, but more importantly signs of congestive heart
failure.  She had serial x-rays which showed worsening
pulmonary congestion.  She was treated with IV lasix 20 mg po
bid with good urine output.  On the day of discharge, her
oxygen saturation improved.  Initially, the patient was
satting 92% on 5 liters.  On discharge, she was satting 95%
on 2 liters.  The CCU team also felt that her hypoxia could
be attributable to either obstructive sleep apnea, or hypoxia
secondary to obesity, considering that a number of her oxygen
desaturations occurred at night.  The patient will continue
lasix therapy for heart failure.  She did have improved exam
and oxygen saturation on the day of discharge.  She will be
continued on lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] at [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.

In terms of her breast cancer, the patient was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], her primary oncologist.  No therapy was initiated
for this during her hospital stay.  She was continued on her
Arimidex which she was on as an outpatient, and she will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-16**].

The patient was continued on her Vitamin B12 for her anemia,
and for her atrial fibrillation no Coumadin was started,
again because of her known metastatic disease.  However, she
was started on Lopressor 37.5 mg po bid.

The patient was also depressed during the course of her
hospital stay.  Social work was involved.  The patient did
not want to see psychiatry.  She was on an SSRI previously as
an outpatient; however, she self-discontinued this and was
not interested in pharmacologic therapy.  Social work
provided services, and also helped her in terms of estate
planning for the future.
