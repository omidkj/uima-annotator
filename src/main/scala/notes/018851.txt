dementia and recent admission for pneumonia who presents with a
blue foot. She had recently been discharged after a
hospitalization for pneumonia. She was discovered to have a
bilateral occlusive DVT presenting as ischemia (phlegmasia
cerulea dolens) as well as a UTI, hypernatremia, and elevated
white count. CTA of the abdomen showed a non-occlusive SMA
thrombus She was started on enoxaparin but was not considered a
surgical candidate given her poor functional status. On the day
prior to transfer, palliative care was consulted regarding end
of life options for the patient, and in a meeting between Dr.

.
[**2171-5-12**]: Occlusive right common femoral, superficial femoral,
and popliteal DVT. Occlusive-to-partially occlusive left greater
saphenous, common femoral, and superficial femoral DVT. Left
popliteal vein unable to be evaluated due to patient
incooperation. Of note, the concurrent CT excludes more central
venous thrombosis in the illiac vessels and IVC, through the
level of the right atrium.
.
CXR: 1. Interval development of moderate right pleural effusion.
The right middle and lower lobe consolidative changes have
improved.  2. No pneumoperitoneum is visualized.
.
AXR [**2171-5-12**]: 1. No supine evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
2. Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern is noted.
3. Possible rectal fecal impaction.
.
CT Abd/Pelv: 1. Non-occlusive non-calcified proximal SMA
atheroma resulting in less than 50% narrowing of the lumen. No
other findings to suggest acute mesenteric ischemia; however,
even with a normal CT this cannot be completely excluded.
Clinical correlation is advised. 2. Right common femoral DVT.
This can be further evaluated for extent with dedicated right
lower extremity ultrasound. 3. Right lower lobe pneumonia with
mild right lower lobe compression atelectasis and moderate to
simple right pleural effusion. 4. Multiple bilateral renal cysts
of which display a partial septal calcification on the right.
This is likely of no clinical significance given patient's age.
5. Ill-defined hypoattenuating peripheral right hepatic lesion
may represent a irregular area of parenchymal fibrosis,
persistent perfusion abnormality ([**Male First Name (un) **]) related to underlying
FNH or, less likely, atypical hemangioma.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 284**] is a 87yF with dementia, recent pneumonia, now
with phlegmasia cerulea dolens, abdominal pain. Prognosis
extremely poor, with ischemia/imminent infarction of right foot
+/- bowel (given abdominal exam and known non-occlusive SMA
thrombus). After a family meeting between the health care proxy
and the palliative care team, it was decided to pursue [**Known lastname 3225**]
status. The patient was transferred to an inpatient hospice
facility.
