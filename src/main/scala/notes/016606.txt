History of Present Illness:
74yoF with h/o bronchiectasis and Pseudomonas colonization s/p
bronchosocpy in [**11/2120**] with pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 88035**] as outpt,
HTN, asthma, hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**6-9**] with R
shoulder pain and SOB, dry cough, pleuritic. She went to [**Hospital1 **]
and had AFib with RVR to 150s, got Cardizem. BP at [**Hospital1 **]
105/69, p104, 90%RA and 98% on 3L NC. WBC count 26k with 28%
bands, CT chest showed complicated RUL and RLL PNA with probably
fissural locules of fluid; moderate partly loculated R pleural
effusion mostly subpulmonic in location; no PE. Admitted to ICU
there, BCx's x2 drawn (negative to date by discharge), and
started Zosyn. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 88035**] did [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 576**] which removed 650 cc's of
thick yellow cloudy fluid, with pH 7, WBC 26k with 82% neutros,
LDH 747, glucose 4, amylase 28, triglycerides 13, Gstain
negative and fluid culture pending. Repeat WBC was 36k with 13%
bands.
.
Regarding AFib, pt had Cards consult and started Dilt gtt which
was stopped due to hypotension and apparently on Hep gtt, not on
at transfer. Ruled out for AMI. Started Digoxin for rate
control. TSH was 1.9. TTE showed EF 55%, mod to severe TR,
severe pulmHTN 60mm Hg, moderate pericardial effusion without
tamponade. Started on Neo-synephrine by transfer.
.
By arrival, the Neo-synephrine was stopped and SBP noted 104.
She denied f/c/ns, presyncope, left sided CP, n/v/abd pain/d,
cough, palpitations. Endorsed R sided pleuritic CP.

STUDIES:
CT Chest with Contrast [**2121-6-14**]:'IMPRESSION:
1. Mixed response to treatment with significant decrease in size
in the right subpulmonic effusion with a pigtail drain in situ.
Increase in size of two of the loculated pleural fluid
collections in the right hemithorax. Interval decrease in size
of multiple loculated fluid collections along the posterior wall
of the right chest; however, some of these appear to be
intrapulmonary rather than pleural.
2. Improved appearance in the right upper lobe consolidation.
3. Persistent extensive bronchiectasis.
4. Increase in the left pleural effusion.

TTE [**2121-6-11**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion with no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. At least moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Mild right ventricular dilation with
borderline normal function. Mild mitral and mild-to-moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Normal left ventricular function.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74yo F with bronchiectasis and Pseudomonas
colonization who presented with large right-sided loculated
empyema, moderate pericardial effusion and hypotension. She was
admitted to the ICU, where she was started on empiric Abx, and
bolused fluids for hypotension, to which she was responsive. IP
was consulted, and a right-sided pig-tail catheter was placed,
when her

#) Bacterial Pneumonia complicated by loculated empyema:
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] where she was
found to have a large right sided pleural effusion,
thoracentesis studies done there were suggestive of an empyema
(pH=7, LDH=747, glucose=4, but culture negative).  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and thoracic surgery
consultation.  She was initally managed in the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU where
she was seen by the interventional pulmonary service, and right
sided chest tube was placed for drainage of her empyema.  Repeat
pleural fluid studies done on admission here were: pH=6.5,
glucose=0 and LDH=1694.  Her antibiotic coverage was broadened
to vancomycin in addition to the zosyn, with plans for a 14 day
course.  She was transferred to the medical floor on [**2121-6-13**],
where she continued to be followed by the thoracic surgery
service, her chest tube was pulled on [**2121-6-19**] and she will follow
up with thoracic surgery as an outpatient.  She will need 4 more
days of IV antibiotics to complete a 14 day course.

#) Atrial Fibrillation:
at [**Hospital3 **] she was noted to be in atrial fibrillation
with a rapid ventricular response, which was new finding for
her.  On initial presentation she was hypotensive, initially
requiring vasopressor support with phenylephrine, which was very
quickly weaned off.  After her blood pressures stabilized she
was started on metoprolol for heart rate control.  Her dose was
uptitrated to 75mg TID, as she had episodes of RVR with lower
doses, her heart rate is currently well controlled on this dose.
 Her CHADS2 score is 1, so she will be started on full strength
aspirin at the time of discharge.

#) Diarrhea:
after about one week of antibiotics the patient started having
diarrhea, she was ruled out for C.diff with two negative toxins
and a negative C.diff PCR and her diarrhea was improving at the
time of discharge.

#) Hypothyroidism:
A TSH checked with her new onset atrial fibrillation was 2.4 and
her home dose of levothyroxine was continued

#) Code Status: Full Code

Transitional Issues:
1. She will need to complete 4 more days of vancomycin and zosyn
for her pneumonia
2. Chest tube care as per page 1 instructions
3. Physical therapy to help her
