History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. Russian-only speaking woman with h/o CAD, DM,

effusions.
.
Patient was just discharged less than 24 hours ago from the
medical service for an admission [**Date range (1) 39099**] for altered mental
status likely secondary to RML PNA, UTI, ARF, and acute on
chronic CO2 retention. Prior to this, the patient was at [**Hospital 55955**] in [**Month (only) 958**]. Sent out with azithomycin and
cefpodoxime. Sent to rehab today, and sent back in for concern
of decreased global functioning, decreased PO intake, and less
interactive. Increased lethargy at nursing home which has been
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] for the last several weeks, per son who was at
bedside. Sats of 88% on RA at nursing home. No reported fever.

95-97% on 4-5L NC. ABG 7.38/69/266. Arousable to painful
stimuli, not to verbal stimulation in Russian. CXR with
increased R effusion, at rehab had not been giving lasix, and
worsening PNA. Given Vancomycin 1g and levaquin 750mg IV,
Aspirin 600mg PR, got 500cc of fluids. UA showing small leuks,

.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was afebrile BP112/60 P85 RR28

participated minimally on the phone with a Russian interpreter.
She denied chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or
leg pain. Further review of systems was not obtained due to poor
patient participation. She would only intermittently answer yes
or no questions. She did not follow commands while on the phone
with the interpreter.

CXR [**3-29**]:

HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with right middle and lower lobe
pneumonia. Acute
mental status changes.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-23**] and 12:

Moderate right pleural effusion unchanged in volume, now
layering posteriorly.
Right middle and lower lobe are clear. There may be right hilar
adenopathy,
but no evidence of bronchial obstruction. Heart is mildly
enlarged. Thoracic
aorta is generally large and tortuous. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was paged to
report these
findings at the time of dictation.
<br>

[**3-28**] CXR:

FINDINGS: There is cardiomegaly, unchanged. Increasing right
pleural
effusion and right lung basilar opacity is concerning for
worsening infection.
There has been interval development of a retrocardiac opacity
also concerning
for infection. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The osseous
structures
are grossly unremarkable. Incidental note is made of clips in
the right upper
quadrant.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening of right pleural effusion.
2. Increased opacity in the right lung base and retrocardiac
region
concerning for infection.
3. Stable cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta.
<br>

CT Head [**3-28**]:

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, recent infarction,
mass, mass
effect, or edema. Again, lacunes are seen in the left basal
ganglia.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities likely reflect
chronic
microvascular disease. The ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are
of normal
configuration and size for age. There is no fracture. Mastoid
air cells are
clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Lacunes in the left basal ganglia region.
3. Chronic microvascular disease changes.
<br>

[**3-29**] Echo:
.
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
mild-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with
relatively preserved apical function (LVEF = 40 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hyp
