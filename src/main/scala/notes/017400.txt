Pertinent Results:
Intra-op TEE [**2175-8-18**]:
Conclusions
Prebypass

The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The remaining left ventricular
segments contract normally.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
he aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a large 1.5
x 1.4 cm homogenous, echodense lesion on the atrial aspect of
the anterior and posterior m itralleaflet tips consistent with
vegetation. There is no valve abscesses seen. There is a
central, severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room.

POST-BYPASS:
Normal biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
There is a m itral bioprosthesis,stable and functioning well.
There no peri valvular leaks. Transmitral regurgitant gradient
is peak 9 and mean 3 mm of Hg.
Intact thoracic aorta.
No new valvular findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION
==================================
#) ENDOCARDITIS and SEPSIS:  Likely directly inoculated from
IVDA.  Likely to have been subacute, explaining the patient's
recent unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and general malaise.
The patient was admitted for abdominal pain and fever and was
found to have leukocytosis to 16K and blood cultures positive
for gram positive organisms.  Empiric therapy was begun with
vancomycin and his white count fell and he defervesced.
Speciation came back as Viridans family Streptococcus sensitive
to ceftriaxone, so ID recommended narrowing antibiotic coverage
to ceftriaxone.  Also was tachycardic with a new III/VI systolic
murmur and peripheral edema worrisome for valvular heart
failure.  TTE performed showed large > 1cm vegitations on the
mitral valve with mitral regurgitation.  TEE was deferred since
patient initially refused and necessary images could be
performed perioperatively.  Patient constantly complained of
chest pain but would continually refuse EKGs.  Tele showed sinus
tachycardia with no evidence of ischemia or AV block.  Troponins
<0.01.  Had symptoms suggestive of septic emboli in abdomen,
neck, left hand, and right foot.  Neuro exam stable throughout
the admission with no focal deficits.  CT abdomen revealed wedge
shaped hypodensity in spleen felt to represent infarct instead
of abscess, so no drainage was required.  Neck MRI showed no
evidence of embolization.  Right foot MRI showed expanding
tubular structure in right posterior tibial artery, likely from
septic embolization.  Vascular surgery consulted and because of
good distal pulses in right foot, felt the limb was not
threatened.  Given size of mitral valve vegitations, evidence of
continued septic embolization, and clinical evidence of valvular
heart failure, CT surgery decided on mitral valve replacement
for curative therapy.

#) MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT: The patient was brought to the
Operating Room on [**2175-8-18**] where the patient underwent Mitral
Valve Replacement (31mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue) with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  PICC line was placed for long term
antibiotic therapy.  Dilaudid PCA was initiated for pain.  Beta
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward
the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with Dilaudid PCA along with oral analgesics for
breakthrough pain.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 5503**]
Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
