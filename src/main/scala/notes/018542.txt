Date of Birth:  [**2061-10-28**]             Sex:   F

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Codeine / Diazepam / Benzodiazepines /
Iodine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis, Right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 yof with hx of CAD s/p cardiac cath with RCA stent
in [**2-/2136**], HTN, Hyperlipidemia, GERD, Afib, diastolic
dysfunction, pericardial effusion, pulmonary HTN who presented
to [**Hospital3 **] after 7 days of increasing SOB, 3lb weight
gain.

Upon review of [**Hospital1 **] records it appears pt was treated for CHF
exacerbation, an Echo was performed which showed significant
pulmonary HTN in the 90s, preserved EF and moderate sized
effusion in the posterior aspect, small anterior pericardial
effusion. During her admission she was also noted to be anemic
with a Hct of 25 from a previously established Hct of 32 and was
transfused 2u PRBCs. Following her Echo findings of an effusion
as well as pulmonary HTN pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for right
cardiac catheterization and evaluation for possible pericardial
effusion.

Pt denies any current chest palpitations, pain, pre-syncope
symptoms. She does endorse some shortness of breath which is
worse than when she was at home but the same as it was in [**Hospital1 2519**]. She endorses a cough with productive white/grey
sputum. She endorses diarrhea which she has had for months,
usually watery. She denies any n/v/f/c, abdominal pain, focal
numbness and tingling.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
Atrial fibrillation
S/P TIA
Depression
Bilateral cataract surgery
Angina
Pneumonia/ Bronchitis
GERD
Anemia
Arthritis
Irritable bowel syndrome
Chronically elevated WBC for past 8 years
s/p TAH/BSO - also reports history of R "ovary explosion" as a
young adult
Hx cholecystectomy and appendectomy

Cardiac Risk Factors: Hyperlipidemia, Hypertension

Percutaneous coronary intervention - reports previous cath,
unsure of date and location


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. Hx of tobacco last use [**2103**] - 2-3 packs/day X 15yrs. There
is no history of alcohol abuse.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.  Pt is a widow, lives in [**Location 5110**]. Has 6
children and 17 grandchildren

Physical Exam:

GENERAL: Obses Caucasian Elderly Female in tripod position
tachypneic on 3 l NC saturating well.
HEENT: EOMI, MMM
NECK: JVP significantly elevated
CARDIAC: S1, S2, ?pericardial rub, tachycardic to 110
irregularly, irregular. Pulsus Paradoxus 8.
LUNGS: Crackles noted b/l mid thorax down.
ABDOMEN: Soft, obese, NT, ND. No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ mixed edema to the knees b/l.


Pertinent Results:
IMAGING of RELEVANCE:

[**2137-4-29**] ECHO The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a large pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential, but is largest
(> 3cm) posterior to the left ventricle. There is approximately
1 cm of fluid anterior to the right ventricle. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-3-2**],
the pericardial effusion is larger. The severity of tricuspid
regurgitation is increased. Estimated pulmonary artery pressures
are higher. The right ventricular cavity size appears enlarged
with global hypokinesis. The ventricular rate is faster.
.
[**5-1**]/ECHO
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is a moderate sized, echo dense inferior and
inferolateraly pericardial effusion without evidence for
hemodynamic compromise.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-4-30**],
the pericardial effusion is now larger and echo dense suggestive
of thrombus/clot. In retrospect, a smaller echo dense
pericardial effusion may have been present on the prior study,
but if so, the effusion is larger and much more apparent on the
current study.
Clinical correlation and serial evaluation is suggested.
