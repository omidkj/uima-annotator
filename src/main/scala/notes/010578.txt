History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history of ESRD on HD,
pulmonary hypertension, chronic diastolic heart failure presents
with fevers and respiratory distress.
.
Per notes and history from family, the patient had been doing
well until 5-6 days prior to presentation. At that time the
patient developed a "cough and a cold". They note a
non-productive cough without fevers, chills or night sweats. At
that time she was noted to have "some rhonchi" per HD nurse. The
patient was thought to have a viral URI. Over the last few days
the patient has been feeling worse and has had poor PO intake.
She went to dialysis on the day of presentation and completed
hemodyalysis. Upon returning home she became more lethargic. Her
temperature and SaO2 were checked and were 101.5 and 85% on
room-air, respectively.
.
She presented to the emergency department with initial vitals of
T 101.5, HR 70, BP 133/60, RR 40 and SaO2 92% on NRB. The
patient was intubated for respiratory distress. WBC was 12.3.
CXR showed LLL opacity and patchy right pulmonary opacities.
Given clinical picture the patient was started on vancomycin,
cefepime and levofloxacin. After Versed bolus patient became
hypotensive and was started on levophed with placement of triple
lumen catheter.
.
Currently, the patient is sedated and intubated.
.
Review of Systems: Unable to obtain from patient.

Imaging:
[**1-8**] CXR: NG tube tip is in the stomach. The central venous line
tip is at the proximal right atrium. The pacemaker leads
terminate in the expected location of right atrium and
ventricle. There is no change in the cardiomediastinal
silhouette, left retrocardiac consolidation which in part is
representing atelectasis as well as pulmonary edema. No
pneumothorax is seen.

(Multiple other CXRs for line placement - all similar).

[**12-31**] RUQ u/s: IMPRESSION: Normal gallbladder without stones,
with normal caliber common bile duct.

[**12-29**] CT torso: IMPRESSION:
1. No clear source of the patient's sepsis. Interval bilateral
pleural
effusions with associated atelectasis. No evidence of focal
infiltration to suggest pneumonia.
2. No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess, bowel obstruction or
fluid
collection.
3. Soft tissue mass with lysis of the anterior left acetabulum
as well as
soft tissue mass arising from the right pleura with associated
destruction in the posterolateral right fifth rib.
4. Multiple healed right-sided rib fractures.
5. Punctate, non-obstructing bilateral renal calculi.

[**12-28**] ECHO: Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid
valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. The supporting structures of
the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to se
