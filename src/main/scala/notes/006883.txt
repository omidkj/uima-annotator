Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
82F with hx of CAD s/p MI in [**2103**], PVD s/p AKA, DM, HTN, high
cholesterol, CHF (10%) who presents with acute onset sob. Per
family, pt has been fatigue with decreased appetite since her
discharge from the hospital last week. (Of note, pt was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 62162**] with gross hematuria with clots
in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR of 3.3; urology was
consulted and recommended CBI and treating UTI; hematuria
cleared by hospital day #3 and pt was discharged.) She was also
complaining of pain on urination and back pain. Her family
states that they were told to increase her fluid intake to try
to flush out the hematuria so the patient has been drinking
three 20oz mugs of water per day (~1.8-2.0 liters). Yesterday,
pt was not very hungry and only wanted soup so she had a
"cup-o-soup" and some crackers. She started feeling slightly
short of breath last night but was able to sleep. This morning,
pt's daughter found the pt sitting upright, with labored
breathing, cold and clammy. The pt was also complaining of chest
tightness and she took SL NTG x 2 without relief. She therefore
presented to the ER.
.
On arrival to ER, pt's BP was 160s/80s with a HR in the 100s.
She was given metoprolol 5mg IV x 1 and started on a NTG gtt.
She was also given 20mg of lasix and 1mg of morphine. A foley
was placed and gross hematuria returned. Cardiology was
consulted for ST depressions noted on EKG. Heparin and plavix
were held due to hematuria and supratherapeutic INR. Urology was
consulted for the hematuria and they recommended continuous
bladder irrigation.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt was very short of breath,
diaphoretic and complaining of chest pain and back pain. She was
given 60mg IV lasix and placed on CPAP 5/5, 40% FiO2.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors
and denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, ankle edema.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
Temp 95.5. Blood pressure was 130/68 mm Hg while seated. Pulse
was 100 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was
36breaths/min on 100% NRB. Generally the patient was well
developed, well nourished and well groomed. The patient was
oriented to person, place and time.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The were no chest wall
deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. The respirations were
labored with use of accessory muscles. Lung sounds were very
decreased with crackles about [**2-2**] way up.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. No murmurs
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. Extremities were cool and clammy.
.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 1+ DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 1+

.
EKG demonstrated sinus tach at 106, nl axis, ST elevation in
V1-V3 and aVR with ST depressions in V5-V6; compared to EKG from
[**2112-6-2**], ST elevations are slightly worse and ST depressions
are new
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2111-4-20**] demonstrated: EF 20-25%
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
distal 2/3rds of the ventricle. Basal segments are hypokinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-4-2**],
systolic function appears similar and c/w multivessel CAD (was
regional dysfunction previously) and the severity of mitral
regurgitation is reduced (previously mild-moderate).
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2107-10-25**] demonstrated:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated
filling pressures (PCWP 22, LVEDP 27), relatively preserved CI
(2.6) and severe hypertension (SBP 190).
2. Left ventriculography revealed severe systolic dysfunction
with an EF of 24%.
3. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system. The
LMCA did not have any significant obstructive disease. The LAD
had a 100%mid occlusion. The LCX had a 70% mid stenotic lesion.
The RCA had a 70% origin stenosis and a 50% mid stenosis.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
.
CXR:
1. Increased interstitial marking and upper zone vascular
redistribution and increased opacity at right lower lobe
suggesting presence of pulmonary edema.
2. Linear markings at the left lower lobe suggesting the
presence of atelectasis. Small amount of left-sided pleural
effusion is also present.
3. Unchanged appearance of small calcified granuloma of the left
upper lobe.
.
CT abd/pelvis:
1. Limited study due to nonadministration of intravenous
contrast. Severely calcified aorta and major branches.
2. Unchanged calcified aneurysm at the cardiac apex.
3. Status post axillofemoral and transfemoral vascular bypass
graft.
4. Diverticulosis, without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
.
CTA chest:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
and
interlobular septal thickening consistent with pulmonary
edema/CHF.
2. Heavy atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries.
Left ventricular calcified aneurysm at the cardiac apex,
unchanged.
3. Enlarged right hilar lymph node measuring 2.2 cm x 1.7 cm,
while this may be seen in the setting of fluid overload, close
interval followup is recommended with repeat CT of the chest in
three months. Alternatively, this lymph node would be amenable
to transbronchial biopsy. In addition, if prior CTs of the chest
are available for comparison, an addendum can be made to this
report.
4. No evidence of thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.
5. Patent right axillary-distal bypass graft.
6. Filling
