Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, weight gain, abdominal distension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ CVL

History of Present Illness:
65 F with history of DMII, HTN, HL, CHF, CKD (baseline creat
1.1-1.5) presents with worsening SOB and DOE x 5 days that
started after her colonoscopy for which she took Golytely.
Reports 10 lb weight gain and sensation of abdominal distension
since then. Had transient substernal chest pain since this
morning, started while at rest, worse with moving. Denies any
fevers, chills, n/v, cough, diarrhea, dysuria. Had some chills
at home but when took temperature, did not have a fever. Her
cardiologist had asked her to increase torsemide from 10 mg
daily to 20 mg daily recently in the setting of increase weight
gain. Daughter states her systolic bp earlier today was in the
70's-80's, baseline is usually 110-120s.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were: 100.8 97 106/54 18 93% RA.
EKG showed concern for lateral ST depressions. Found to have a
systolic blood pressure in the 70s, CVL was placed, levophed
started with stabilization of BP in low 100s. CXR shows
pulmonary edema. BNP notably elevated at 7436, JVP elevated, she
was given lasix 20 mg IV x1, and lasix 40 mg IV x1. Repeat
rectal temperature was 102.0F, was given ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for concern of pneumonia. Her chest pain improved
following 2mg of IV morphine. Guaiac negative, was given ASA and
started on heparin drip. Labs notable for troponin of 0.91,
creatinine elevated at 2.4 from her baseline of 1.1-1.5, lactate
of 2.9.
.
On transfer to CCU her most recent vitals were: 107/60, 80,
98%1L
.
Notably, was admitted here for CHF flare in 11/[**2195**]. At the time
had enterococcus bacteremia.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion, SOB, orthopnea, weight gain. Denies palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
CXR [**3-27**]
FINDINGS: Compared to prior exam, there is increased pulmonary
edema, which is now moderate-to-severe. Subtle consolidation may
be obscured by this edema. There is likely a left pleural
effusion; retrocardiac opacity may be related to adjacent
atelectasis but is incompletely evaluated on this single view.
No pneumothorax is detected. Cardiomegaly persists.

IMPRESSION: Increased moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema

TTE [**3-29**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and lateral akinesis to
hypokinesis. Estimated LVEF ?35-40 percent but views are
subotpimal for assement of ventricular wall motion. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function (regional motion could not be adequately
assessed). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial
pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**3-31**]:
FINDINGS: There is significant improvement in bibasilar
opacities compared to [**3-29**]. Cardiomegaly and moderate
bilateral pleural effusions are
essentially unchanged. There is no definite focal consolidation;
however,
underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is no
pneumothorax. The right internal jugular catheter has been
removed. IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**4-2**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there is now a nasogastric tube in place. It extends well into
the stomach, then coils back on itself so that the tip lies in
the upper stomach, both below the
esophagogastric junction.
There is still significant pulmonary edema, though improved
since the earlier study.
.
[**4-3**] CT abdomen and pelvis
1. No acute abdominal pathology, especially no evidence of
colitis or bowel obstruction is seen.
2. Extensive vascular calcifications of the abdominal aorta and
major
visceral branches.
3. Bilateral moderate-sized simple pleural effusion, with
compressive
atelectasis of the lung bases.
4. Small subcutaneous bleed in the the left lower abdomen,
likely related to subcutaneous injection.
