ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 8040**] is an 83 year
old woman with a history of heart disease and congestive
heart failure who had been hospitalized multiple times for
exacerbations of her CHF, which were managed medically with
diuresis. She was found to have aortic stenosis, with a valve
area of 0.7 cm, and it was felt that a surgical repair of
this would greatly improve her symptoms. She also had a
coronary angiogram which showed a small 50% lesion off her
left anterior descending, but otherwise no significant
disease. She was admitted on [**2167-5-16**] for preoperative
evaluation and elective repair of aortic valve, with possible
bypass grafting.  But, as noted, with the lesion demonstrated
on previous catheterization, it was felt that coronary artery
bypass grafting was not indicated at this time.

On admission examination, the patient's weight was 63.0 kg.
She was afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically normal, with a
pulse of 60 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 120/48. She was
satting 96 percent on room air. She was otherwise alert. She
had clear breath sounds. She had a systolic ejection murmur
which was felt to be IV/VI. Her abdomen was soft and she had
2+ bilateral pedal edema.

Her preoperative white blood cell count was 6.4, with
hematocrit of 31, platelet count 284. Her BUN and creatinine
were 19 and 1.1. Her urinalysis did not evidence any
infection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted, as noted, on
[**5-16**] for a preoperative workup.  Subsequently, on [**2167-5-19**], after her culture data had all evidenced no infection
and her carotid ultrasounds had shown no significant carotid
stenosis, she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a 21
mm CE Magna pericardial valve.  There were no intraoperative
complications, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
She was taken intubated from the operating room to the
cardiac surgery recovery unit, where she remained
hemodynamically stable overnight. By postoperative day two,
she was extubated and was otherwise with stable hemodynamics
and oxygenation. At this time, the patient's chest tube and
central venous access were removed. She did revert to atrial
fibrillation on postoperative day two, at which time she was
started on amiodarone, as per the patient's
electrophysiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**]. We were initially going
to begin heparinization, but as the patient's platelet count
had been trending down into the seventies to eighties, it was
felt that it would be prudent to initially send off an HIT
panel prior to starting heparin. Heparin was discontinued at
this time. She never had any sort of bleeding problems.

The patient was transferred to the general floor on
postoperative day 3, where she continued to do well and was
maintained on oral amiodarone 400 mg twice a day, along with
Lopressor and diuresis with Lasix. Coumadin was started as
per cardiology consultation. The remainder of the patient's
hospitalization was essentially unremarkable, with continued
beta blockade and amiodarone, with coumadinization and
diuresis.  As the patient never had any significant episodes
of congestive heart failure during her hospitalization from
her atrial fibrillation, she was given the option of trying
with transesophageal echocardiography and cardioversion prior
to discharge from her electrophysiologist versus
anticoagulation and discharge on amiodarone, with possible
cardioversion as an outpatient if she did not spontaneously
convert. She preferred the latter option.

It is felt by [**5-25**] (postoperative day 6) that this
patient was afebrile, otherwise hemodynamically normal, with
a pulse in the 90's (atrial fibrillation) but a blood
pressure with a systolic in the 110's and saturating 96% on
room air, that she could be discharged to rehab in stable
condition. Her discharge weight was only 1.5 kg above her
admission weight and, as noted, she was continuing diuresis.
She was therefore discharged to rehab on postoperative day 6
in fair condition on the following medications:

Colace 100 mg p.o. twice daily when taking narcotics.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. once daily.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
Coumadin 1 mg p.o. at bedtime.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. once daily.
Detrol 4 mg p.o. once daily.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. once daily.
Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Vicodin 5/500 one tab every 6 hours as needed for pain.

The patient would need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
in 4 weeks. She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**], her
electrophysiologist, in the next 2-3 weeks for adjustment of
her Coumadin dosing, possible outpatient elective
cardioversion. She is also to follow up with her primary care
doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3707**], for followup for her Coumadin and for
general medical assessment within the next week. The patient
was to eat a cardiac/heart healthy, low sodium diet. She has
strict sternal precautions and is to avoid weightbearing with
her arms or chest.
