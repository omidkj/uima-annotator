History of Present Illness:
88 y.o female with history of COPD, dementia presenting from [**Hospital1 1501**]
after an unwitnessed fall and was found to have congestion,
cough productive of phleghm, low grade temp at [**Hospital1 1501**]. On arrival,

Studies:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2101-3-7**] 10:28 PM
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity could represent atelectasis,
infection, and/or aspiration.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2101-3-9**] 3:49 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-8**], there is little
overall change.  Opacification at the left base in the
retrocardiac region with blunting of the costophrenic angle is
essentially unchanged. Although this most likely represents
atelectasis, the possibility of pneumonia with pleural effusion
must be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

Pulmonary vessels are still indistinct, suggesting elevated
pulmonary venous pressure, though this is less prominent than on
the prior examination.

ECG Study Date of [**2101-3-8**]  5:31:22 AM
Baseline artifact. Probable sinus tachycardia. Borderline low
limb lead
voltage. Early R wave progression. ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the
previous tracing of [**2100-7-4**] atrial fibrillation is new.

ECG [**2101-3-10**]
NSR with TWI in V1-V4


Brief Hospital Course:
88y.o woman with history of COPD, diastolic CHF, dementia who
presents to the hospital from her [**Hospital1 1501**] after a fall from a
wheelchair and was found to have a LLL infiltrate. She
subsequently decompensated in the emergency room with increasing
hypoxia and wheezing on exam with CXR concerning for increasing
vascular opacities for which she was placed on BIPAP and able to
be quickly transitioned to nasal cannula.

Hypoxia: Differential diagnosis for hypoxia for this woman
includes COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis
and congestive heart failure. COPD was unlikely given lack of
wheezing on exam and good air movement. She does have a small
left lower lobe infiltrate however which did not appear to be
very significant. Given her history of aspirations, this appears
to be one component of her hypoxia, as well as mild fluid
overload. She received one dose of steroids, one dose of
levofloxacin, IV lasix for diuresis and was kept on NC. She did
not have a leukocytosis or fever, though her exam was rhonchorus
particularly on the right base. The most likely explanation was
chemical pneumonitis and mild fluid overload which improved with
diuresis and BiPap. She was maintained on nebs and inhalers.

CAD: She has known CAD. Her admission EKG showed diffuse t-wave
flattening with slight lateral depressions in V5-V6. On [**3-10**] it
showed NSR with TWI in V1-V3 most prominently and V4. Her
troponins were negative and she was started on statin and
aspirin to pair with her beta blocker.
Follow-up:
- CK and LFTs in 2 weeks

COPD: No an exacerbation of COPD. She was given one dose of
steroids in the ED. She was treated with nebs and advair per her
home regimen.

Depression: Stable. Continued on citalopram.

Dementia: We minimized tethers in an attempt to preserve sleep
wake cycle.

History of aspiration: The patient apparently has had several
swallow studies at the [**Hospital1 1501**] which has demonstrated mild
aspiration in the past, however the family is aware and do not
want NG or PEG tube. She was given a soft dyphagia diet.

She was DNR/DNI throughout this admission.
