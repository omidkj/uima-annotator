Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Expressive aphasia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2164-10-2**] Transesophageal Echocardiogram
[**2164-10-8**] Cardiac Catheterization
[**2164-10-7**] Surgical extraction of infected teeth number 13 and 32.

History of Present Illness:
39 yo male with a history of mitral valve vegetations who
presented with aphasia likely from MCA embolic stroke.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after presenting to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital. One
week prior to his initial presentation he felt fatigued and
stayed in bed for 3 days. For the two days prior to presenting
he spent most hours of the day sleeping, did not eat or drink or
get out of bed.  1 day prior to inital presentation he found
that he could not speak, although he knew what he wanted to say
and could understand what others said to him.
Pt reports he had less energy for the past 1 [**11-18**] yrs and feels
this may be related to his endocarditis.  He describes having
night sweats for the past year and a half, and a L
parieto-temporal headache for the past year. He had no
documented fevers.  He had no focal weakness, numbness, or
paresthesia.  No blurry vision or diplopia. No lightheadeness or
dizziness.
He initially presented to Cape Code hospital were he had a CT of
the head that showed a low attenuation zone in the posterior
corona radiata extending along the left external capsule of
uncertain etiology. MRI scan showed multiple acute/subacute
infarcts with paramagnetic effect in the left temporal lobe and
right parietal hemisphere suggestive of hemosiderin from
hemorrhage. He was transferred to this hospital for further
management.

Images:
MRI/MRA Head w/o contrast [**2164-9-25**] (done at OSH): Multiple
acute/subacute infracts with paramagnetic effect left temporal
lobe and right parietal hemisphere suggestive of hemosiderin
from hemorrhage.  Suggestion of petecheal hemorrhage was also
noted on recent head CT.  The multiplicity of infarcts is
suggestive of embolic source. There is gradual narrowing of the
M2 segment of the left middle cerebral artery with paucity of
signal involving cistal branch vessels.  Findings are consistent
with hemodynamically significant stenosis and probable distal
occlusion  There is no evidence of aneurysm or high flow AVM.

MRA Brain w/o contrast [**2164-9-26**]:  Occlusion of an M2 branch of
the left middle cerebral artery with attenuation of distal MCA
branches and acute ischemia in the left posterior MCA territory
consistent with acute infarction. Additional foci of restricted
diffusion as described above along with several punctate foci of
enhancement and susceptibility artifact are suggestive of an
embolic process. Enhancement may be secondary to septic emboli
or subacute infarction.

BAS/UGI air/SBFT [**2164-9-28**]: Normal upper GI esophagram and normal
hypopharynx without evidence of Zenker's diverticulum,
dysmotility, ulcers, or strictures.

Additional Studies:
TTE [**2164-10-4**]: Compared to the findings of the prior study of
[**2164-9-26**], left ventricular cavity size has increased and
systolic function has deteriorated. The previously seen large
posterior mitral leaflet vegetation has probably decreased in
size while the anterior vegetation has probably increased in
size. However, direct comparison of vegetation size can be
inaccurated with TTE. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation
persists.

EGD [**2164-10-1**]: negative for any obstruction or ring/web of
esophagus
