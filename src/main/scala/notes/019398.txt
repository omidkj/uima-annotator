Comment: Source: Line-art line
CHEST, 1 VW

An ET tube is present, in satisfactory position approximately
4.2 cm above the carina. An NG tube is present, coiled in the
stomach, extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film. There is
patchy alveolar opacity in both lungs, most pronounced in the
left mid and right perihilar regions, with dense retrocardiac
opacity. More patchy opacity is seen in the right upper zone.
Air bronchograms are visible on both sides. No gross effusion is
detected.

IMPRESSION:

Patchy opacity involving both lungs, compatible with pneumonic
consolidation.

RENAL U.S. (PORTABLE)

Reason: ELEVATED CR

INDICATION: Elevated creatinine.

No prior studies are available for comparison.

FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 13.6 cm and the left 14.6
cm. The kidneys demonstrate normal parenchymal thickness and
echogenicity without evidence of calculi or hydronephrosis. The
bladder is not distended and cannot be evaluated.

IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound.

INDICATION: 58-year-old male with HIV and legionella pneumonia,
now with elevated alkaline phosphatase. Assess for biliary
obstruction.

COMPARISONS: None.

FINDINGS: The gallbladder is mildly distended. There is no
pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall edema. The common bile
duct is visualized and is not distended measuring approximately
6 mm in diameter. Just inferior to the neck of the gallbladder
are several shadowing foci which could represent either surgical
clips versus tiny calcified gallstones present within the cystic
duct. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary
dilatation.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary obstruction. Possible small
stones present within the cystic duct, though this is uncertain.
If persistent symptoms, an MRCP is recommended for further
evaluation.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: assess pna, ? cavitation or other sign of fungal infxn

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old man with intubated, with HIV, legionella pna,
aspergillous growing on sputum culture
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess pna, ? cavitation or other sign of fungal infxn
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 58-year-old man intubated with HIV, Legionella
pneumonia, Aspergillus growing on sputum and culture. Rule out
cavitation or other sign of fungal infection.

No prior CTs are available for comparison.

FINDINGS: Multiple focal areas of airspace consolidation are
noted involving almost all pulmonary segments, bilaterally with
linear and, reticular opacities, ground-glass opacities, and
consolidation, along the bronchovascular distribution. There is
no evidence of cavitary lesions. No evidence of pleural
effusions. No evidence of pneumothorax. A small bleb is noted in
the medial aspect of the left upper lobe.

The heart is normal in size. No evidence of pericardial
effusions. Signs of anemia are noted. Calcifications at the
aortic root are seen. The patient is intubated. The endotracheal
tube tip is 2.6 cm from the carina. An NG tube is noted with its
tip is excluded. Right-sided central venous line with its tip in
the SVC. A left-sided central venous line is noted with its tip
in the right atrium.

The visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral multfocal areas of
