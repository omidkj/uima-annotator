INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Normal
interatrial  septum.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional  LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. Normal  aortic arch diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA
systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Echocardiographic results were reviewed by
telephone with the houseofficer caring for the patient.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular  cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is  mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are three severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area 0.7 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Symmetric LVH with preserved
global and  regionaln biventricular systolic function. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Mild  pulmonary hypertension. Mildly
dilated thoracic aorta.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2104-9-9**] 11:41 AM
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT
Reason: s/p line placement
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old man s/p AVR CABGx2 on Trach mask now tachypenic
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p line placement
HISTORY: Line placement.
SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
Comparison is made to [**9-4**] and [**9-9**] examinations.
FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a right
subclavian central venous catheter with its tip terminating
within the right atrium. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly improved with more layering of
the effusions on this supine radiograph. Amount of alveolar and
interstitial edema may be slightly improved in the interval.
Positioning of tracheostomy tube and left-sided central venous
catheter along with left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity is not
significantly changed.

IMPRESSION:
1. Tip of new right central venous catheter terminating within
the right atrium.
2. Slight improvement in bibasilar atelectasis. Persistent
layering pleural effusions. Perhaps mild increase to alveolar
and interstitial edema (difficult to tell given change
technique).

Discussed with PA [**Doctor Last Name **] on date of exam at 1:30 p.m.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
