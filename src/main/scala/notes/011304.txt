History of Present Illness:
39 y/o with morbid obese without recent medical care presents
with SOB. History obtained via records and his friend. The
patients landlord entered his appartment today in order to evict
him and found him lying on the floor. He stated at that time
that he had been unable to move for 2 days [**3-19**] his back pain and
was not eating or drinking. The patient had been working as a
chef until 3 weeks ago but had been fired. He has been depressed
recently and gained approximately 100 pounds over the last 3
months.
He was taken to St [**Hospital1 88007**] hospital in [**Hospital1 189**]. There he was
somulent. He was given vanco and ctx for cellulitis as well as
DuoNebs and albuterol. A d-dimer was elevated (D dimer 5.04,
range <0.52). BNP 325. He was sating in the 70s on room air, and
improved to 90s on NRB. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.7 P 100 BP 160/130 R 24 O2 sat
95% on NRB. Patient was given 1 gm vancomycin and 3L NS. ABG
showed severe hypercarbia and hypoxia. He was noted to appear
diffusely erythematous (even prior to vanco). CXR showed
cardiomegaly and CHF. He was intubed using a fiberoptic scope
and propofol was started. VS prior to transfer were 104/57, 84,
17, 89% on AC with 100% FIO2.

On the floor, we was intubated and sedated on arrival with sats
in the mid 80s. 1 PIV was lost in transfer of the patient.

CXR (Portable AP) [**2165-12-5**]:
FINDINGS: Consistent with the given history, an endotracheal
tube has been
introduced. The distal tip is situated approximately 5.1 cm from
the carina.  Please note the positioning is markedly limited and
the lung bases are excluded. There are diffuse interstitial and
alveolar opacities and marked widening of pneumomediastinum. The
cardiac silhouette is not included.

IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study as above. Signs of heart
failure again
noted. Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.

TTE [**2165-12-6**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
is not well seen. No aortic stenosis and no aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No
mitral regurgitation is seen (suboptimal technical quality).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
very small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process or primary right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Preserved global left
ventricular systolic function.

Lower extremity US [**2165-12-6**]:
IMPRESSION: Deep vein thrombosis seen in the posterior tibial
veins of the right calf. No additional thrombus seen in either
leg.

RUQ ultrasound [**2165-12-11**]:
1. Extremely limited study; there is suggestion of a nodular
liver parenchyma which could correlate with chronic liver
disease, but evaluation is markedly limited.
2. Slightly distended gallbladder with no evidence of
gallstones.
3. Splenomegaly.

CTA Chest [**2165-12-23**]:
1. Significant image noise due to body mass index, allowing for
this limitation, there is no evidence of a first to third order
pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal lower lobe pneumonia.
3. Moderately severe pulmonary arterial enlargement suggesting
pulmonary
hypertension.
4. Global moderate cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxic and hypercarbic resp failure: Likely multifactorial,
combination of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, fluid overload.
Patient was found down at home, intubated on admission and
admitted to the ICU.  TTE showed EF of 55%, right ventricular
cavity enlargment with free wall hypokinesis suggestive of a
primary pulmonary process or primary right ventricular
cardiomyopathy.  Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was elevated
at 36.  He was started on aggressive diuresis for CHF
exacerbation with lasix drip and chlorothiazide which was later
changed to metolozone.  His ICU length of stay fluid balance was
negative 30 liters.  He was ruled out for MI as source of CHF
with cardiac enzymes x 3.  PE was also considered on
differential for respiratory failure.  Lower extremity US showed
right posterior tibial DVT; PE was suspected but on admission
pt's size did not accomodate CTA machine. In addition, giving
ongoing hypoxemia, a bubble study was performed to rule out
shunt, but was poor in quality. He was started empirically on
heparin gtt which was eventually discontinued when pt began
having bloody secretions.  After aggressive diuresis, he was
able to undergo CTA that showed no PE in a large vessel but
could not rule out PE in smaller vessels due to body habitus.
Bronchoscopy was performed to investigate bl
