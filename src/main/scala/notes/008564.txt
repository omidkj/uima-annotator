transfer from OSH for difficult wean

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 55 y/o F hx HCV treated with IFN, cyroglobulinemia with
progressively worsening peripheral myopathy followed by
neurology and dysphagia who was recently admitted to OSH for
planned peg due to dysphagia, poor PO intake and 5 pound weight
loss over past 3-4 months. During admission, she developed
hypoxia, fever and was found to have an aspiration pneumonia.
Sputum Cx grew serratia, E. coli, and staph. She required
intubation and was hypotensive requiring pressors X 2 days. She
is currently on day [**7-19**] of cefepime and has been off pressors X
4 days. Per ICU attd at OSH, she was difficult to wean from vent
presumably from neuromuscular weakness and is now s/p trach on
[**2145-1-25**] and currently on PS 15/5 30%. She received daily PS
trials but was not able to maintain sufficient tidal volumes
with PS below 10. She also received a muscle biopsy on [**2145-1-25**]
with results pending. She is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] forfurther
neurologic evaluation.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **], she reports feeling pain around her trach,
but no other complaints besides fatigue. Prior to her admission,
her husband denies any sick contacts, cold-like symptoms, no
unusual fevers/chills beyond those assoc with IFN. NO chest
pain, palp, abd pain, bladder/bowel incontinence. No
Diplopia/blurry vision/headache.
.
With review of OMR and OSH records, it appears that for past 6
months, she has had progressive weakness and DOE/SOB as well as
paresthesias of both legs to the knees and fingers. Prior to
this, she has no probalems. Also, she has had difficulty
swallowing X 3-4 months, decreased appetite and 30 pound weight
loss over last 2 months. He husband finally brought her in for
evaluation because she was not able to keep any foods down. Her
dysphagia started with solids and then progressed to liquids.


Past Medical History:
1. treated hepatitis C.
- diagnosed genotype 1a, [**2129**]
- treated with PEG interferon and ribavirin x 48 weeks ending in
[**5-11**]
- virologic relapse after 4 weeks leading to low dose PEG
interferon starting in [**1-12**] x 4 years, finished in [**1-16**]
- In [**6-16**] had a cryocrit of 6% so maintenance PEG interferon
restarted
- known cirrhosis
- known varices
2. Asthma.
3. Recent hoarseness which was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in ENT

and was felt to be due to reflux esophagitis.
4. s/p choly
5. s/p appendectomy
6. hx venous thrombophlebitis 25 yrs ago
7. [**1-/2145**]: NSTEMI at [**Hospital3 **]


Social History:
The patient has smoked 2 packs a day for the past 30 years. She
does not use alcohol. She is married and has two sons. She does
not use any herbal medicines or supplements. She denies any drug
use.

Family History:
Her mother has diabetes with neuropathy. She does not have any
muscle problems or dysphagia in the family. Her mother had a
three-vessel CABG. There is no evidence of Parkinson's, MS,
strokes, seizures, or other neurologic diagnoses in the family.

IMAGES

[**2145-1-1**] EMG: Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic
evidence for a mild proximally predominant myopathy with some
denervating features. There is also evidence for a mild to
moderate, chronic, sensorimotor, generalized polyneuropathy
which is axonal in nature and appears symmetric. Compared with
the prior study of [**1-13**], the polyneuropathy is new and the
myopathy is more clearly present.

[**2145-1-26**] Liver US:
1. Coarse hepatic echotexture consistent with cirrhosis without
focal
lesions.
2. Stable dilation of CBD.
3. Trace ascites, without sufficient fluid for safe bedside
paracentesis.

[**2145-1-27**] echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
