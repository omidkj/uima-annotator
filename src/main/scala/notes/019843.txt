Imaging:

Chest X-ray [**2105-6-4**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Chest X-ray [**2105-6-6**]: In comparison with study of [**5-5**], there
are patchy areas of increased opacification involving the right
mid and lower lung zone. Although some of this could represent
asymmetric or dependent pulmonary edema, the failure of cardiac
enlargement goes against this possibility. Therefore, these
findings are worrisome for developing consolidation.

Abdominal US [**2105-6-5**]: The liver demonstrates normal echotexture.
There are no focal liver lesions identified. Patient is status
post cholecystectomy. There is no intrahepatic biliary
dilatation. The common bile duct is markedly dilated and
measures up to 12 mm in maximal diameter. The dilatation extends
into the periampullary region. The portal vein is patent with
normal hepatopetal flow. The right kidney measures 11.2 cm.
There is a simple cyst measuring 2.1 x 1.2 x 1.5 cm in the mid
pole of the right kidney. The left kidney measures 12.1 cm.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, renal masses or renal
calculi.

MRCP [**2105-6-7**]:
1. No evidence of biliary obstruction or common bile duct
calculus.
2. Bilateral renal cysts, multilobulated at the upper pole of
the right
kidney.Some heterogeneous enhancement in the right renal upper
pole is non
specific, but could represent evidence of recent pyelonephritis.

3. Moderate right pleural effusion and patchy right lower lung
consolidation.
4. Small left pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 62 year old female with h/o frequent UTIs who
presents with fevers, flank pain, nausea, cough, pyuria,
admitted to MICU for hypotension.
