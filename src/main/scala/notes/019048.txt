Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening shortness of breach

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP and MICU stay

History of Present Illness:

This is a 73 year-old female with stage III COPD (FEV1 < 32%
predicted in [**2115**] on 2L home O2), moderate-to-severe aortic
stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm, Mean gradient 39mmHg, peak velocity
4.0), diastolic LV dysfunction, with multiple previous
admissions for COPD exacerbations, most recently required
intubation in [**2117-2-4**], who presents with progressive DOE.
Patient was discharged from pulmonary rehabiliation to home 4
months ago and has been noticing increasing exertional dyspnea
since then.  She was sent to the hospital by one of her
daughters today because they felt she needed to be seen.
Patient presented to the ED, where she was noted to be mildly
tachypneic and presumed to have a COPD exacerbation, and given
prednisone 20mg x 1, and also started on trial of BiPAP for 20
minutes, along with nebulizers x 1.  She was then transferred to
the medical floor for further treatment.
.
Upon transfer to floor, patient was noted to have oxygen
desaturation from 92% to 84% on 2 litres nasal cannula, and had
increasing tachypnea.  ABG was obtained and showed 7.40/60/68.
Patient was transferred to MICU for possible need to initiate
BiPAP.  Upon further review of systems, patient acknowledged
increased cough over past 2 weeks as well as + sick contact
([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (NI) 1022**] has URI symptoms).  She denies any fever, change
in sputum, PND, orthopnea, worsening LE oedema (has chronic
oedema), chest pain, palpitations, weight gain, or dietary
indiscretion, although she does report not always adhering to
her diuretic regimen.

Pertinent studies:
CXR [**2117-8-26**]: Overall, the appearance of the chest is similar to

[**2117-4-2**]. The heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are
within normal limits and unchanged. The lungs are clear. No
focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. The bones are
unchanged.
.
TTE [**3-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging
are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CXR -[**8-29**]:
The lungs are mildly hyperinflated. The heart is not enlarged.
The aorta is tortuous and slightly calcified. There is
borderline upper zone
redistribution, but no overt CHF. Minimal atelectasis at the
left base. No
infiltrate is identified. Area of triangular density abutting
the inferior
anterior chest wall is thought to represent a cardiac fat pad
and is similar to appearance on prior films (e.g., [**2114-4-3**]). Extreme right
costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. No pneumothorax is
detected.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. COPD Flare: The patient's shortness of breath was consistent
with an exacerbation of her chronic bronchitis.  Her CXR did not
show any evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  She was
given IV methylprednisone and converted to oral prednisone for a
taper. In addition she was treated initially with a 5 day course
of azithromycin followed by a 5 day course of levofloxacin given
her continued symptoms.  In addition she was treated with
standing albuterol and ipratroprium nebulizer therapy. Upon
discharge her symptoms improved to baseline.
.
# Bacteremia: The patient remained afebrile despite growing [**3-7**]
blood cultures for gram positive cocci in clusters.  The patient
was started on gentamicin and vancomycin for coverage but had
stable vital signs throughout the episode. Gentamicin was
discontinued.  TTE was performed revealing knwon stable AS with
a thickened valve but no evidence of vegetation.  Repeat blood
cultures were drawn daily and upon discharge all showed no
growth to date.  She was discharged on a continued 2 week course
of Vancomycin.
.
# Aortic stenosis, chest pain:  The patient was ruled out for an
MI.  We continued her ASA and lasix during her stay.  Given the
patient's AS with valve area of 0.8 cm2 with nl EF on last echo
[**3-10**] her fluid status was monitored carefully. Her chest pain
quickly resolved and she had no further episodes throughout her
hospitalization.
