INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Unstable angina.

PROCEDURE:
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
left femoral artery.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French JL4 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation: was initiated with an
introducer
sheath using a Cardiac Assist 9 French 30cc wire guided
catheter,
inserted via the left femoral artery.
Peripheral Catheter placement was performed.
Peripheral Imaging was performed.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated severe LMCA and three vessel disease. The LMCA had
a hazy
distal stenosis of 80%. The LAD had long serial tubular 80%
stenosis of
the proximal and mid LAD. The mid LCX had a complex 80%
trifurcation
lesion. the RCA had proximal 80% and mid 90% stenosis with
collaterals
to the LAD seen distally.
2) Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate systemic
systolic
and diastolic hypertension.
3) Left ventriculography was deferred.
4) A 30cc IABP was placed via the left femoral artery with
confirmation
of proper placement by flouroscopy.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel and LMCA coronary artery disease.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Dynamic
interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic
function. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. Mild
(1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA
systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality as the patient was
difficult to
position. Based on [**2188**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis
recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk
(prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thick
