Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 64**]
Chief Complaint:
Left Hip Pain/ Osteoarthritis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2139-4-15**]: Left THR


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 69 year old male with a severely arthritic left hip.
 This hip has been bothering him for upwards of 2 years and
radiographic studies have demonstrated complete bone on bone
involvement with lateral osteophyte formation, and a relatively
[**Name2 (NI) 42397**] acetabulum consistent with DDH. He does relate a
single incidence of trauma to the hip back approximately 11
years
ago during a hurricaine, but that probably is not a major
component. He at this point states that his pain, which he feels

primarily in the left groin, is [**8-1**] with activity, [**3-1**] with
rest. He is able to walk only about 2 blocks. He occasionally
has used a crutch in the past but not presently. He has a lot of

discomfort when he transitions from a seated to a standing
position. He can still ambulate sequentially on stairs, more
problem[**Name (NI) 115**] ascending than descending but oftentimes has to
revert back to one step at a time. It is painful for him to be
in a plane or a car for persistent periods of time. The hip pain

wakes him up every 2 or 3 hours at night.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted after his procedure which he tolerated
well.  Please see the dictated operative note for further
details.  In the PACU, the pt was noted to be excessively sleepy
with occassional desaturations when he would fall asleep.  He
was therefore admitted to the ICU for observation overnight.  As
the anesthetic cleared the pt's system, the episodes ceased and
he was trnasferred out to the floor early in the morning of
POD#1.  On arrival to the floor, he was noted to be relatively
hypotensive with low urine output.  He was mentating fine and
only complained of pain at the procedure site.  More aggressive
fluid resuscitation was begun.  Likely secondary to dehydration,
the pt went into acute renal failure with a doubling of his
creatinine to a high of 2.6.  Fluid resusucitation was continued
and all potentially nephrotoxic medications were held.  Also on
POD#1 the Physical Therapy Service began working with the pt and
continued to work with him throughout his hospitalization.
Lovenox therapy was also initiated.  In prior discussions with
the pt's cardiologist and PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was determined that the pt no
longer needed to be on coumadin for his past episodes of atrial
fibrillation, and so this medication was not restarted post-op,
and instead the pt will have the usual 2 week course of DVT
prophylaxis with Lovenox.
By POD#2, the pt's renal function had corrected and he began
auto-diuresing.  His creatinine returned to his baseline of 1.3
by the time of discharge.  He was gradually restarted on his
usual home medications including his usual diuretics.  Xrays
obtained demonstrated the hip components in good position.
The pt's Foley catheter was removed on POD#3.  The pt's wound
continued to mildly ooze serosanguinous drainage and he was
prophylactically placed on Keflex while the draining continued.
The pt's other main issue during his admission was pain control.
 After initial control with a PCA, he was transitioned to oral
pain medication.  Adequate pain control was eventually achieved
with oral Dilaudid.
By the day of discharge, the pt was tolerating a regular diet
with his pain adequately controlled on oral pain medication.  He
was discharged to rehab in stable condition with instructions to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the office.
