Nausea, vomiting, abdominal tenderness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP ([**9-30**])
Central venous line placement ([**10-1**])
Arterial line placement ([**10-1**]); removal ([**10-2**])

ERCP for stent replacement ([**10-12**])


History of Present Illness:
The patient rpeorts that he symtpoms began yesterday when she
began to experience nausea and had several episodes of vomiting.
She has also been noticing that he belly has been distended
recently. She complains of on-and-off-diarrhea every five weeks
or so, but has not experienced any diarrhea this week. The
patient says that her abdomen hurts only when people push on it;
alone and undisturbed, her abdomen is non-tender. The patient
has no history of gallbladder or liver disease that she knows
of. She further denies any RUQ pain. She has not experienced and
hematuria or dysuria. (Per reports from [**Location (un) 620**], the patient may
not have been accurate in my interview. There she was brought in
with complaints of LLQ pain and jaundice.) At [**Location (un) 620**], the
patient received metoprolol IV 5 mg, Zofran, and 3 liters of
fluid.
.
In the Emergency Department, a CT scan showed "Severe
intra/extrahepatic biliary dilatation; severe pancreatic duct
dilatation with pancreatic atrophy; nodular enhancement at
ampulla suggests possible malignancy. 2. Distended
gallbladder with wall edema and perihepatic ascites, likely [**2-23**]
severe biliary dilatation. 3. Stool distending the entire colon;
distended small bowel likely [**2-23**] to the stool. L spigelian
hernia contains a colon loop and free fluid, but no obstruction
is seen at the level of the hernia, and no bowel wall
thickening. 4. AVN of L femoral head again seen." The Emergency
Department had discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and arranged direct
admit to surgical floor and possible ERCP evaluation, but then
they noted that she was in AFib RVR 120's. Also has [**Apartment Address(1) **] mm in
lead III, and ST depressions in V [**2-27**], worse since prior EKG.
Has had a silent NSTEMI in past. Cardiology saw the patient and
felt that negative stress from 8 months ago made Mi very
unlikely. The patient was given metoprolol both PO and IV and a
dose of Zosyn.
.
On the floor, the patient was tired but denied any specific
abdominal pain. She denies being nauseated. She also denied
feeling any palpitations.

Past Medical History:
hypertension, cataracts with a recent iridectomy in [**10/2133**],
hyperreflexic bladder, degenerative arthritis of her neck and
back, and osteoporosis.

Social History:
Lives with her daughter, ambulates at home with a cane. No
smoking or alcohol.

Family History:
Her family history is positive for a stroke in her brother.
Otherwise, it is noncontributory.

Imaging:
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:
There is marked intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilation, as seen on recent CT. The common bile duct measures up
to 1.2 cm. Gallbladder is distended, likely reflecting biliary
obstruction. There are no stones within the gallbladder, nor is
there sludge identified. There is no gallbladder wall thickening
or pericholecystic fluid. There is trace fluid in Morison's
pouch, without generalized ascites. The pancreas could not be
well visualized due to significant bowel gas in the midline.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation, as seen on
recent CT. Further evaluation with ERCP or MRCP is recommende
