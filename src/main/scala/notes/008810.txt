History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a complicated medical
history who was recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 1516**] service at
[**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 29441**]) after a CHF exacerbation who is presenting with
nausea and found to have worsening kidney function. The patient
has been experiencing nausea for several days now.
.
At last adm on [**9-20**], torsemide 100mg increased to 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
lasix with 5mg metolazone. Cr baseline around 3.8 prior to last
adm, but during last adm was low 4s. now up to 5.2. BUN has been
steadly trending up, and was 181 on adm (88 last adm to [**Hospital1 1516**]).
.
On [**2160-10-2**], she saw her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1683**],
who felt that the nausea may be secondary to her diuretics. The
patient's metolazone was stopped and furosemide decreased/held
unless patient's weight was to exceed 187 pounds. (Dry weight
estimated at 185 pounds.) Since that visit, the patient has had
increasing nausea and loss of appetite. She has been able to
keep her medications down. The patient denies any blood in her
emesis, she has not vomitted much, it is primarily feeling too

recent worsening of her breathing, cough, or worsening of lower
leg edema. She is able to lay flat with [**Last Name **] problem. She has no
cough. She states she has not been urinating as much as
previously.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's initial vitals were
97.2 62 124/47 24 97%. She underwent a chest X-ray, which showed
improvement in pulmonary congestion in comparison to previous
radiograph. A KUB showed no evidence of obstruction or
intraperitoneal free air. The patient received lactulose and
40mEq of potassium in the ED. Her vitals on transfer were
97.4po, 123/45, 64, 16, 99% 2L.
.
On the medicine floor, the patient continued to be nauseated and
had an episode of greenish emesis. The emesis had no evidence of
blood. The patient was otherwise comfortable on 2L nasal
cannula.

2D-ECHO ([**2160-8-7**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate global
hypokinesis and akinesis of the distal anterior septum and apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP > 18 mmHg). Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial eff
