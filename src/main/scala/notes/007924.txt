Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
sore throat

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral Line [**2103-10-10**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1182**] is a 62 year old woman with a history of Afib on
coumadin, s/p CVA [**2095**] who presents with sore throat x 1 day.
Patient describes the onset of anterior right sided neck pain at
5 pm the day prior to presentation.  By the middle of the night
the pain had progressed to causing her pain with swallowing and
lifting her head. She had one episode of emesis and a few hours
of diarrhea early the next morning. She then reported feeling
physically weak and mentally confused. She states she was
"talking ragtime" and not making sense when she tried to call-in
sick to work.  Her daughter came over to visit and was concerned
because the patient's symptoms of confusion were similar to the
symptoms she had during her stroke in [**2095**].  Her daughter called
the ambulance and brought her to the Emergency Department.

In the ED initial vital signs were T 102.4 HR 138 BP 97/44 RR 20
SpO2 99% RA. CXR was unremarkable. CT neck showed an ill defined
hypodensity, stranding and loss of fat planes in the right
hypopharynx and deep spaces of the right neck extending to the
carotid space with retropharyngeal fluid/edema. There was no
definite organized abscess but imaging was concerning for an
infectious process. Given concern for retropharyngeal abscess
she was treated empirically with Unasyn 3 g IV and ibuprofen 800
mg po.

Patient became increasingly hypotensive. A femoral line was
placed as they wanted to avoid a central venous line in her
neck.  She was given 4 L of IV fluids and started on
norepinephrine gtt.  Given the nonspecific swelling seen on CT
neck, ENT was consulted. They performed a laryngoscope and found
no compromise in her airway and no indication for drainage.

On arrival to the ICU, patient states she is feeling much
better. She denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, fevers,
chills, lightheadedness, headache, confusion, nausea, and
diarrhea. She denies any recent traumas, dental procedures, oral
infections, antibiotic use.  She reports having several sick
contacts as she is a fifth grade teacher and has had three
students out recently with strept throat.  She denies history of
similar pain.

Past Medical History:
Atrial fibrillation
CVA in [**2095**] without residual deficits
Thyroid dysfunction (in the process of getting it worked up in
outpatient setting---amiodarone recently discontinued)
Rosacea


Social History:
Patient lives with her husband. She works as a 5th grade
teacher.  She denies any use of tobacco, illicit drugs or herbal
medications. She reports drinking 1 alcoholic drink per month

Family History:
Not relevant to this admission.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION:
1. Hypodensity in the right posterior parietal region may
represent
subacute/old infarct, underlying vasogenic edema may be present;
no evidence of volume loss or mass effect. Findings could be
further evaluated on MRI.

CT NECK W/CONTRAST (EG:PAROTIDS) IMPRESSION:
1. Ill-defined hypodensity, stranding and loss of fat planes in
the right
hypopharynx and deep spaces of the right neck extending to the
carotid space with large amount of retropharyngeal fluid/edema.
No definite organized abscess is present. The differential
diagnosis includes infectious process vs much less likely longus
[**Last Name (un) **] tendinitis.
2. Mild mass effect on the right side of the hypopharynx with
mild narrowing of the airway at the hypopharynx but the airway
appears patent.
.
CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-11**], there are
continued
bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis and
pulmonary edema in a patient with cardiomegaly. The degree of
vascular engorgement may be slightly less prominent.
.
Cardiac Echo Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for
left ventricular diastolic function. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Indeterminate indices for diastolic function
assessment. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-7-21**],
the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old woman with a history of Afib on coumadin, s/p CVA
[**2095**] who presented with sepsis in the setting of acute onset
retropharyngeal swelling.

# Sepsis, likely due to retrophayrngeal infection.  She did not
have any URI symptoms, and CXR did not suggest pneumonia. She is
a schoolteacher and was exposed to several children with Strep
throat the days prior to her symptom onset.  She also did not
complain of any urinary symptoms and UA did not suggest UTI.
Because of the hypotension requiring large amount of fluid and
pressor, she received a femoral line.  She was started on Unasyn
for her retropharyngeal infection on [**2103-10-10**].  Her blood
pressure and urine output responded to fluid and pressor, which
was gradually weaned off.  Femoral line was discontinued in the
evening of [**10-11**].  BP continued to be stable.  She was
transferred to the floor from the ICU on [**2103-10-13**]. On the
floor she continued to improve, and remained hemodynamically
stable.
.
# Retropharyngeal infection.  CT neck did not show abscess, and
ENT was consulted.  Her airway remained patent without need of
intubation throughout the hospital course.  Patient began
antibiotics with Unasyn 3 g every 6 hours on [**2103-10-10**].  ENT
was consulted and
