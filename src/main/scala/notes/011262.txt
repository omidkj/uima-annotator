Chief Complaint:
progressive DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization x 2
Stenting of SVG to diagnol with cypher stent for 90% stenosis


History of Present Illness:
66 year old man is s/p an MI at age 31 with subsequent five
vessel CABG in [**2141**] (LIMA -> LAD, SVG -> RCA,
SVG->D1->OM2->OM3), ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an LVEF of 25%, HTN and AS who presents with
exertional dyspnea and chest discomfort. Patient has significant
h/o CAD with multiple cardiac catheterizations through the
years, most recently in [**2152-11-29**] while in [**State 108**]. At
the time he had noticed a recurrence of exertional dyspnea and
chest discomfort. An echo reportedly had revealed aortic
stenosis with a peak gradient of 52 mmHG with a valve area of
1.0cm2 and a PA systolic pressure of 61 mmHG. Cardiac cath at
that time revealed a patent LIMA and SVG to the diagonal. The
ostial diagonal graft had a tight stenosis that was treated with
bare metal stenting. The jump graft to the OM??????s and the SVG to
the RCA were occluded. He reported resolution of his symptoms at
that time.
.
Since [**Month (only) 404**] the patient has noted that his exertional dyspnea
and chest discomfort have returned. Symptoms have been
progressive since then and are limiting him significantly. He
reports that he becomes SOB with limited exertion and can only
walk [**1-30**] block without stopping due to dyspnea. Additionally, he
has been getting exertional chest discomfort, non-radiating,
relieved by Imdur. He denies associated nausea or diaphoresis.
He also reports worsening orthopnea but no LE swelling. He was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath which he underwent on
[**2153-6-20**]. He was found to have an ostial occlusion of SVG->D1,
but he was not intervened upon because of critical AS (0.88cm2)
due to a question was whether he should have AVR done at the
same time. However, the patient requested to have the AVR done
at another time and to proceed with stenting of SVG->D1 now. He
returned to the cath lab on [**2153-6-21**] for PCI where he had a
Cypher stent placed in the SVG-D1. Right heart cath revealed an
elevated PCWP of 26. Additionally, his aortic valve gradient was
imaged with and without dobutamine and there was no change with
dobutamine.
.
On arrival to the CCU the patient denied CP, SOB, palpitations.
He denied recent fever or chills. He denied nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain. He also denied recent dysuria or change in his
bowel habits.

Pertinent Results:
Last cath at OSH was as follows: [**12-4**]
- LAD with proximal occlusion
- LCx diffusely diseased with multiple collaterals
- RCA with ostial occlusion
- SVG to RCA is occluded
- SVG from aorta to D1 is known to be occluded in the sequential
segment from the diag to the OMs. (95% ostial) --> stented (bare
metal)
- LIMA-> LAD is patent
- moderate AS with valve area of 1.3cm2
- elevated LVEDP
- LVEF noted at 20-25%
.
[**2153-6-14**] echo: LV dilated with concentric LVH and markedly
decreased contractility. Diffuse hypokinesis noted of the
anterior apical and lateral walls with akinesis of the inferior
wall. EF estimated at 25%. [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6878**] at 5.0cm. Aortic valve
calcified with a peak gradient of 37 mmHG, mean of 21 mmHG and a
valve area of 0.98cm2. There was trace AI, mild to moderate MR
and moderate TR with a calculated PA systolic pressure of 62
mmHG. (Prior echo from [**9-3**] revealing aortic valve area of
1.3cm2)
.
[**2153-6-20**] cardiac cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated multivessel severe CAD. The LMCA had 60% distal
stenosis.
the LAD was occluded proximally and diffusely diseased in the
mid and
distal segments. The LCX was diffusely disease with total
occlusion of
its OM1 branch. The RCA was occluded.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed occluded SVG to PDA and

occluded sequential OM1-OM2 vein graft. The SVG-Diag had 90%
ostial
stenosis (in-stent-restenosis). The LIMA-LAD was patent.
3. Resting hemodynamic assessment revealed severely elevated
left and
right heart filling pressures with mean PCWP of 41 mmhg and
LVEDP of 36
mmhg. Pulmonary arterial pressure was severealy elevated (72/36
mmHg).
Systemic arterial blood pressure was mildly elevated (146/70
mmHg).
4. Severe aortic stenosis was evident with mean gradient across
the
aortic valve of 27 mmHg and calculated aortic valve area of 0.88
cm2.
5. Left ventriculography revealed severely impaired systolic and

diastolic funstion with calculated LVEF 25% and LVEDP 36 mmHg.
The LV
was globally hypokinetic. Mild mitral regurgitation was noted.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with 90%
in-stent-restenosis at
ostium of SVG-Diag.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.
3. Mild mitral regurgitation.
4. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
5. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
6. Severe primary pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2153-6-21**] cardiac cath: COMMENTS:
1. The SVG lesion was stented with a 3.5 mm cypher stent and
posted with
a 4.0 mm balloon with an excellent result. (See PTCA comments)
2. The gradient across the aortic valve was measured with
Dobutamine
infusion with increasing doses. The gradients prior to and at
the peak
of the infusion are 21.79 mm and a21.45 mm Hg resepectively. The
[**Location (un) 109**] for
the same calculation were 1.03 cm2 and 1.08 cm2 respectively.
3. The single plane cine ventriculogrphy showed severe systolic
and
diastolic dysfunction with a calculated EF of 26%.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely compromised ventricular function.
3. Mild to moderate AS
4. Successful stenting of the SVG.
