Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
46 yo female with PMH significant for asthma (diagnosed 7 years
ago at which time she required intubation) who presented to her
PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few day history of progressively worsening cough, HA
and shortness of breath. The patient was in her normal state of
health until the evening prior to presentation when she
developed viral like symptoms with rhinorrhea, cough productive
of thin yellow sputum and frontal HA.  Symptoms became acutely
worse the day of presentation despite  went to her PCP where she
was noted to be tachypneic with bilateral wheezes. Of note the
patient ran out of her home albuterol and a few days ago and
flovent approximately 1 month ago. She was given nebulizer
treatments x 2 with no improvement prompting her PCP to send her
into the emergency department.
.
In terms of her asthma the patient was diagnosed 7 years ago
when she had an acute exacerbation requiring intubation. Since
that time she has been hospitalized a several occasions most
recently a few months ago. She is on albuterol PRN at home which
she has been requiring more frequently (though as above she ran
out of this medication recently).  She was previously on flovent
but stopped this medication approximately 1 month ago due to
insurance issues.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.7 102 174/102 22 99% RA. Initial
peak flow 350. She was given nebulizers x 3 the started on
scheduled nebs q 1 hr nebulizer treatments in addition to
prednisone 60 and IV magnesium. Oxygen saturations remained
stable in the high 90s.  Patient continued to have significant
wheezing requiring hourly nebs.  Peak flow trended downward to
250 and she was admitted to the MICU for further treatment.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 98.4 104 112/99 99%
RA.  She noted continued wheezing but and chest pain with cough
but denied recent fever, chills, abdominal pain, dysuria, visual
changes, or dizziness.

STUDIES
CXR-IMPRESSION: Similar band-like opacity suggesting minor
atelectasis or scarring in the right lower lung with no definite
acute disease.
.
H-CT [**2142-7-3**]
IMPRESSION:  Mild effacement of the basal cisterns and crowding
of the foramen
magnum is concerning for increased intracranial pressure.  Mild
cerebral edema
cannot be excluded.  Further evaluation with MRI could be
helpful, if
clinically indicated.
.
[**2142-7-3**] sinus CT
IMPRESSION:  Relatively mild mucosal changes in the paranasal
sinuses without
evidence of osseous remodeling to suggest chronic sinusitis. No
evidence of
acute sinusitis.
.
MRI/MRV brain [**2142-7-3**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal MRI/MRV of the head, specifically without evidence of
acute
hypertensive encephalopathy, sinus vein thrombosis, infarct, or
mass.

2. Low lying cerebellar tonsils and small syrinx in the proximal
cervical cord
that should be further assessed by MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**].
.
MRI C/T/L spine [**2142-7-9**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly low-lying cerebellar tonsils without posterior fossa
abnormality or
crowding at the level of the foramen magnum.

2. Small syrinx at the C1/C2 level without evidence of
associated lesion.

3. Otherwise, normal appearance of the cervical and thoracic
cord, conus and
cauda equina.

4. Mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine as detailed
above.
.
EKG [**2142-7-5**]
Sinus rhythm. Leftward axis. Otherwise, normal tracing. Compared
to the
previous tracing of [**2142-7-3**] no change.
.
[**2142-7-5**] CXR
IMPRESSION:  New peripheral left lower lobe opacity, concerning
for developing
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo female with a hx of asthma requiring intubation in the
past who presents with wheezing and shortness of breath c/w an
asthma exacerbation in the setting of a probable viral
infection, medication non complaince course c/b pneumonia and
headaches found to have a chiari malformation and cervical
syrinx

# Acute exacerbation of asthma
Presentation was felt to be most consistent with an exacerbation
of the patients known asthma secondary to environmental factors,
URI and medication non compliance. Initially, there was no e/o
PNA on CXR (see below). CP mildly concerning for ACS though
normal EKG and TnI is reassuring. Pt does not have risk factors
for PE. As above she initially required q 1 hr albuterol
treatment in the ED. She was started on oral prednisone and
given a one time dose of IV magnesium. She was admitted to the
ICU given need for frequent treatments and history of requiring
intubation. Respiratory status improved and nebulizer treatments
were spaced to albuterol every 4 hours and ipratropium every 6
hours. She was additionally restarted on her home Flovent.  She
was transferred to the floor where her symptoms persisted.
Pulmonary was consulted and they advised to add Singulair and
briefly placed her on IV steroids.  Her symptoms slowly improved
and her peak flow improved to around 350 (reported baseline is
500).  The Pulmonary team recommended a cost effective regimen
including Symbicort, Spiriva and Singulair, given the patient
social situation.  The pharmacy was called and it was estimated
that this regimen would cost about $13 doll
