ECG: 100bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no st-tw changes.

CXR: 1.  Suboptimal positioning of central venous catheter
within the mid-right
atrium.  This should be withdrawn by 5 cm.
2.  Increasing parenchymal opacities at the left lung base.
This likely
represents asymmetric edema.  Alternatively, this could be a
manifestation of
aspiration.

KUB: Diffusely  dilated  loops  of  small  bowel  with
air-filled  colonic
loops. These  findings  could  represent  ileus  or  early
small  bowel  obstruction.

ABG:7.34/47/133 on NRB


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo m w/ h/o recent cva and g-tube placement who p/w new onset
hypoxia, w/ rhonchi on exam, LLL opacity on cxr, elevated
lactate on MUST protocol.

1) MUST- Lactate remains elevated despite high svo2.  BPs stable
so no indication for pressors/inotropes.  Pt rec'd 4L NS in ED
so adequately volume resuscitated by criteria.  Cortisol stim
test pending.  Does not meet criteria for APC given recent CVA
and low APACHE score (11).  Likely etiology is infectious given
significant bandemia, most probable is pulmonary given LLL
findings and lung exam.  PNA vs aspiration. Other possibilities
included enteric given findings on KUB and recent surgical
placement of PEG tube.  Covered w/ vanc/ceftriaxone/azithro, no
indication for additional pseudomonal coverage w/ cefepime. Used
NS boluses to maintain cvp>8 and patient was continued on MUST
protocol.  Hospital course as below.

2) PNA-presumptively treating for, pt rec'd
vanc/azithro/ceftrixone/cefepime/clindamycin in ED.  Simplified
regimen to include vanc/ceftriaxone/azithro. Sputum culture grew
out e.coli and klebsiella.  Over the hospital course the
patient's respiratory status deteriorated.  In d/w family,
patient's goals of care were changed to CMO given his ongoing
decompensation.  Patient passed away on HD2 of respiratory
failure.

3) illeus- also possible that pt may have transmigrated bacteria
secondary to illeus.  covered for gram neg on admission.

4) glucose- RISS, QID fs

5) prophylaxis- maintained on gi, hep sc, pneumoboots
(aggressive given h/o DVT)
