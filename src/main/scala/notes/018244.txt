Admission Date:  [**2181-8-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2181-9-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2112-4-2**]     Sex:  F

Service:  C-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
female with known coronary artery disease (status post
myocardial infarction in [**2174**]; status post coronary artery
bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery
to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft
to obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to right
coronary artery in [**2174**]) who predominantly to the [**Hospital 620**]
campus complaining of chest pain for three hours with the
onset in the evening of [**8-28**] while at rest.  This chest
pain was associated with nausea and shortness of breath.

The patient reported that earlier that day she was a
restrained driver in an automobile accident in which her car
was hit on the passenger side in the front.  There was no
airbag deployment, but after the accident the patient vomited
once and developed chest discomfort with radiation to the
right breast and arm.  At that time, the patient reported
that her chest pain was [**10-26**] in severity.

On arrival to the [**Hospital 620**] campus, the patient's
electrocardiogram showed 2-mm ST elevations in leads II, III,
and aVF with 2-mm ST depressions in V5 and V6.  Leads aVR,
aVL, and V1 to V3 had inverted T waves.

The patient was given aspirin and morphine and was started on
heparin and Integrilin drips and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for emergent cardiac
catheterization.

During the cardiac catheterization, the patient had
occasional episodes of hypotension and was started on
atropine and dopamine.  The patient was found to have
bleeding from her groin after multiple access attempts.  Her
hematocrit was revealed to be 28 and a Swan-Ganz catheter
showed low right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge
pressures.

The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit without
having any interventional performed.  The patient was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and given
intravenous fluids.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 95.3 degrees
Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 71, her blood pressure was
127/61, her respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen
saturation was 97% on room air.  In general, a thin woman in
no acute distress.  The patient was confused.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat examination revealed pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae were anicteric.
The oropharynx was clear.  The neck was supple.  No masses.
A right internal jugular triple lumen line was present.  No
jugular venous distention.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  A grade [**1-22**] to 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border.
The abdomen was soft and mildly tender in the lower
quadrants.  No distention.  Positive bowel sounds.  There was
a large epigastric ventral hernia.  Groin revealed minimal
oozing of blood in the left and right groin sites.  Distal
pedal pulses were intact.  Neurologic examination revealed
the patient followed commands.  Extraocular muscles were
intact.  The level of consciousness initially varied.
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
on admission revealed her white blood cell count was 10.6,
her hematocrit was 36.7, and her platelets were 326.  Mean
cell volume was 92.  Her sodium was 134, potassium was 4,
chloride was 93, bicarbonate was 27.7, blood urea nitrogen
was 22, creatinine was 1.1, and blood glucose was 119.  Her
calcium was 9.1.  Her magnesium was 1.9.  Her albumin was
3.8.  Her ALT was 58.  Her AST was 25.  Troponin was 0.3.
Creatine phosphokinase was 48.  Her INR was 1.2.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 60.  Normal axis.  ST
elevations of 2 mm in leads II, III, and aVF and V5 and V6.
ST depressions in V1 to V3.  Lead aVL with T wave flattening
and inversion.

A chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia or congestive heart
failure with mild cardiomegaly.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ISSUES:  The patient's creatine
kinase peaked on [**8-29**] at 1641.  The patient's initial
cardiac catheterization was unsuccessful for any intervention
and was complicated by a retroperitoneal bleed.  The
procedure was terminated at that time as the patient's
hemodynamic instability and retroperitoneal bleed presented
prevented further attempts at stent placement.

After the patient's hematocrit stabilized, she was
transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit to the Cardiology
floor where she had occasional episodes of jaw pain and chest
pain which were relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.

The patient underwent a Persantine MIBI on [**9-7**]; during
which the patient had [**5-26**] chest pressure and chest pain with
the infusion, but no electrocardiogram changes.  The MIBI
portion revealed moderate partially reversible defects
involving the mid and lateral wall which extended to the apex
and a hypokinetic lateral wall, with an ejection fraction of
62%.

The following day, the patient developed an additional
episode of chest pain while at rest.  The patient was started
on a heparin drip and given sublingual nitroglycerin.  The
pain resolved.  The patient was to undergo a repeat cardiac
catheterization on [**9-10**] with a planned intervention at
that time.

2.  RETROPERITONEAL BLEED ISSUES:  After the multiple access
attempts during the patient's initial cardiac catheterization
the patient's hematocrit dropped, and she became hypotensive.

The patient underwent an urgent abdominal and pelvic
computerized axial tomography which revealed a large
left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma in the pelvis,
diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, and no
evidence of bowel obstruction.  A ventral hernia containing
nonobstructive loops of transverse colon.

The patient was transfused with two units of packed red blood
cells, and her hematocrit was followed serially.  After
several days, her hematocrit was found to be stable in the
low 30s.

In addition, a repeat abdominal computed tomography on [**9-4**] revealed a greatly decreased left pelvic wall hematoma.
At this point, the patient's retroperitoneal bleed was felt
to have resolved, and the patient's hematocrit was felt to be
stable.

The decision was made to proceed with cardiac catheterization
on [**2181-9-10**].

3.  HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient had several episodes of
hypotension while on the Cardiology floor.  The patient's ACE
inhibitor was discontinued as was her daily nitrate in order
to maintain her systolic blood pressure around 100.  The
patient was given several boluses of intravenous fluids as
needed and was continued on her daily Lopressor for rate
control and for cardiac benefits.

4.  URINARY TRACT INFECTION ISSUES:  On [**9-4**], the
patient was found to have developed a low-grade fever
overnight and was complaining of dysuria that a.m. a
