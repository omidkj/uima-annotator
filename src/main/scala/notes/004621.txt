Date of Birth:  [**2051-12-19**]             Sex:   M

Service: [**Year (4 digits) 662**]

Allergies:
Penicillins / Amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
afib with rvr and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
55M w PMHx diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD
stent [**4-/2106**], meningioma s/p resection c/b seizure disorder,
former EtOH abuse, DM, CHF (EG 50-55%), afib on Dofetilide. The
patient was in his usual state of health without chest pain,
shortness of breath, palpitations, or syncope and was seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-2**] for management of pAF. At that time he was
found to be in sinus, without signs of CHF, tolerating
dofetillide without QTc prolongation. The decision was made to
dc digoxin 250mcg daily and lasix 20mg daily and start the pt on
lisinopril 20mg. He was also asked to switch from warfarin to
dabigatran, though this was never filled due to pharmacy issues.
  He felt well until Monday when he felt SOB, chest tightness,
with "fluid building up around" his heart. He also endorses
consuming etoh, as much as [**6-5**] drinks while watching hockey...
On [**5-10**] he presented to [**Location (un) 620**] after becoming acutely dyspneic
with nonspecific CP. He denied palpitations or LE edema. He was
given Lasix IV, morphine and started on a nitro gtt however his
bp didn't tolerate (dropped to 80s/50s), BNP of 4734. He was
ruled out for MI. CXR demonstrated a prominence of the pulmonary
vasculature as compared with a previous read as acute CHF. Out
of concern for pna he was given 1 dose of Levoflox in the ED. He
was also given Haldo for ?agitation. Subsequent QTc prolongation
was noted (max 600) and therefore his Dofetilide was put on
hold. While off dofetillide he developed rapid AF with rates in
the 120-130??????s, hemodyam stable with bp in 180-190 range. He was
given lopressor 5mg IV, home nadalol and lisinopril and lasix.
HR decreased to 100-110s' however BP is dropped to 80's. He
received 2L NS and...The pt was transferred for management of
a.fib.
   On admission to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, his HR ranges from 100-130 and his
sBP 110-130. He is free of complaints.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

.
EKG:  Afib @ 120, QT 410.
.
[**5-10**] CXR: This has suboptimal technical quality. There is
general prominence of the pulmonary vasculature as compared with
a previous examination from [**2106-10-27**] compatible with acute
congestive failure.  There are no acute parenchymal infiltrates
and there is no definite pleural effusion. The heart is slightly
enlarged as before.
IMPRESSION:
ACUTE CONGESTIVE FAILURE.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**5-10**] (at [**Location (un) **]) The left atrium is mildly
dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters are most
consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No pathologic
valvular abnormality seen. Moderate diastolic dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
55M w PMHx diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD
DESx2 [**4-/2106**], meningioma s/p resection c/b seizure disorder,
EtOH abuse, DM, CHF (EG 50-55%), afib on Dofetilide who
presented to OSH for acute CHF exacerbation and developed Afib
with RVR.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: The pt has a history of pAF resistent to
electrical cardioversion. He was started on dofetilide in
[**Month (only) 1096**] and remained in sinus without complication. Due to
Levaquin and Haldol received at BIDN, in conjunction with
Dofetilide, pt developed QTc prolongation on EKG (reportedly up
to 600). Dofetilide was discontinued and pt re-developed afib
with rvr which has proven difficult to control. On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**], QTc was < 500 msec and Dofetilide 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] was
restarted. He returned to NSR. He was discharged to continue
dofetilide 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] and coumadin daily.
.
# Hypotension: Per report from OSH, pt was alternating between
hypertension and hypotension, stemming largely from the doses of
beta blockade and vasodilation he received. He remained
normotensive at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
# Acute CHF exacerbation: Pt presented to OSH with acute CHF
exacerbation likely [**12-29**] combination of dietary indiscretions and
recent discontinuation of lasix and digoxin. He was restarted on
digoxin 250 mcg per day and lasix 20 mg per day on discharge.
.
#. DM: Last A1c 6.6%, managed on Metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
#. CORONARIES:  Patient with a history of CAD s/p DES to LAD.
Continued ASA, Plavix, simvastatin, and fish oil.
.
# Alcoholism: given pt's anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension and
hx of etoh abuse, will put on diazepam CIWA.
.
# Seizure d/o: Pt with hx of Meningioma s/p resection c/b
seizure d/o. Continued LeVETiracetam 1250 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
DVT prophylaxis was with coumadin. The patient remained full
code.
