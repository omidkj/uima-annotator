Chief Complaint:
Transfer given power failure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26495**] is an 82 year-old female initially admitted to an
OSH on [**9-3**] with mental status change in the setting of
hyponatremia and hypertension who is now being transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] given a power failure at the OSH.
.
NOTE:  The following history was obtained via discussions with
the transferring attending.
.
Initially presented to an OSH on [**9-3**] with mental status
change.  Found to be hypertensive (220/60) with a sodium of 118.
 Also noted to have an INR of 7.0.  Course was complicated by
respiratory failrue requiring intubation on [**9-8**].  Subsequently
extubated on [**9-16**].  Now on BiPAP at night (15/5 with FiO2
0.40).  Also noted to be c.diff positive and was started on PO
vancomycin.  Covering attending at OSH also reports that the
patient was on IV vancomycin but she is unsure for what reason.
.
Given a power failure at the OSH, patient was transferred for
further care.
.
At the time of discharge patient's weight was 158.5 lbs, her dry
weight.
.
In speaking with the husband, he reports that two days prior to
admission to the OSH the patient fell.  It does not appear that
she hit her head.  The following day she had problesm getting to
the bathroom and would loose her stool while urinating.  Two
days after falling her she was disoriented; this prompted the
husband [**Name (NI) 33606**] to [**Hospital1 18**].
.

.
CXR [**9-25**]:Cardiac size is top normal. Bilateral pleural effusions
are small on the left and moderate on the right. There is no
pneumothorax. There is mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Patient is post median sternotomy. NG tube tip is out of view
below the diafragm.
.
[**9-26**] CT head w/o contrast: No intracranial hemorrhage. Paranasal
sinus and left mastoid abnormalities seen as described above, in
part post-surgical in origin.
.
[**9-27**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal LV systolic funciton.
.
MRI/MRA head [**9-28**]:
1. No acute infarcts or signal abnormalities suggestive of
osmotic demyelination.
2. Mild generalized atrophy.
3. Short segment stenoses of the A1 segment of the left ACA and
the right MCA bifurcation, which likely represent
atherosclerotic changes.
.
EEG [**9-29**]: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized

background and bursts of generalized slowing. These findings
indicate a
widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and
subcortical
structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection
are
among the most common causes. There were no areas of prominent
focal
slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There
were no
clearly epileptiform features


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
82 year-old female with a history of CAD, CKD, DM, Afib who
presented to an OSH with mental status change in the setting of
hyponatremia and hypertension who is now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
after a power failure at the OSH.
.
1. Mental status change:
LP, MRI without causation.  Pt is responsive, answering name and
answering "in hospital" when asked orienting questions.  EEG
with diffuse encephalopathy.  Neurology team at [**Hospital1 18**] felt that
the decreased mental status is likely due to hypoxic damage in
the septic, peri-intubation period.

2. Respiratory failure:
Currently saturating well at 95% on face tent receiving Fio2
35%.  Per sign-out from OSH, patient was intubated from [**9-8**] -
[**9-16**] with respiratory failure.  Appeared volume overloaded on
admission. At [**Hospital1 18**] pt has been diuresed about 500cc per day
requiring Lasix 120 mg IV bid.  At most recent CXR [**2179-10-3**],
pleural effusions resolved, pt still has mild interstitial
edema.  Wt today is 171 lbs. Pt has also been responding to
blood pressure control and aldactone.

3. C.Difficile colitis:  Completed course of oral/pr vancomycin
at [**Hospital3 **] and through [**Hospital1 18**].  C. difficile negative x 3
here at [**Hospital1 18**].

4. Atrial Fibrillation:  Pt currently in sinus rhythm.  Continue
beta blocker and coumadin.  She is currently on coumadin 2 mg po
daily for past 2 day (previously held)  needs at least qod INRs

5. Aspiration risk: Due to decreased mental status.  Will need
re-eval and feeding by NG tube until then.

6. Chronic kidney disease:
Baseline creatinine 1.8.  Currenly at this baseline.

7. Diabetes:
On extremely high dose of lantus with Januvia.  Please start
Januvia if available at rehab and if so be sure to titrate
lantus dose - will likely need less.

8.  Heel wounds:  Please see attached wound care recs.
