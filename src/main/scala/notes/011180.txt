Chief Complaint:
Presyncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placement
Chest tube placement


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 10544**] is an 83 year-old woman with a history of HTN and a
recent diagnosis of 2nd degree AV block (Mobitz type I) with
associated symptoms of syncope who presents for expedited
pacemaker placement. She was in her USOH until four weeks ago
when she began experienced episodes of light-headedness. The
episodes lasted about 30 minutes in duration, were relieved by
sitting and lying down, and occured a few times each day. They
were not vertiginous in character. Her symptoms were initially
thought to be related to hypotension secondary to
antihypertensives and these medications, which included
metoprolol, amlodipine, and lisinopril, were titrated downward.
The ACEi was discontinued on [**12-5**]. However, her symptoms
persisted and she underwent Holter analysis which demonstrated
Mobitz type I 2nd degree AV block and bradycardia. She was
scheduled for routine pacemaker placement but her symptoms of
syncope became acutely worse yesterday, with several episodes
and significantly diminished ability to ambulate, and she was
advised to present to the ED for admission. Though she has been
presyncopal, she has not syncopized. She has, however, had
dyspnea with exertion during this time period.

In the ED, initial vitals were T: 98.1 HR: 62 BP: 165/72 RR: 18
O2Sat: 94RA. She was then admitted for further evaluation and
management.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. Cardiac review of
systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea.


Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of tobacco abuse
(stopped smoking in [**8-28**])
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3. Osteoporosis.
4. Remote history of colon carcinoma, s/p resection
5. Peripheral vascular disease status post aortoiliac
reconstruction
6. Left ventricular hypertrophy with hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy physiology.

Social History:
The patient lives with her husband. She has been retired for the

CXR [**12-19**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-18**]:
Small left pneumothorax persists, predominantly apical, despite
left pleural drain projecting over the lateral aspect of the
hemithorax. Left pleural effusion is minimal if any. No right
pleural effusion or mediastinal widening. No acute pulmonary
abnormalities. Mild cardiomegaly longstanding. Overall lung
volumes and the configuration of the chest reflect COPD.
Thoracic aorta is generally large and calcified, but not focally
aneurysmal. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer
leads are in their expected positions, as far as one can tell
from frontal view alone. Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema
in the left chest wall reflects thoracostomy tube insertion.
Incidental note is made of azygos fissure, common anatomic
variant.
CXR [**2130-12-22**]:
Interval improvement of pneumothorax
.
EKG [**12-18**]:
Sinus bradycardia. Atrial bigeminy. There is variation in
precordial
lead placement as compared with previous tracing of [**2130-8-30**].
Leads V1 and V2 are similarly placed. Since the previous tracing
of [**2130-8-30**] atrial bigeminy has appeared.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 10544**] is an 83 year-old woman with a history of HTN, HOCM
(60 mm Hg gradient at rest), and a recent diagnosis of 2nd
degree AV block (Mobitz type I), SA exit block, and variable PR
(dual pathway AV node) who presents with worsening syncope.
.
# Mobitz Type 1:  Patient was recently found to have 2nd degree
AV block (Mobitz type I) on Holter monitor with associated
symptoms of presyncope.  Overall, patient had multiple rhythm
abnormalities based on Holter study, including sinus bradycardia
(26-71 BPM, average 50 BPM), atrial ectopy, and ventricular
ectopy.  She underwent pacemaker placement but became
hypotensive during the procedure and was started on dopamine.
This was discontinued after a few hours but she was transferred
to the CCU because a CXR demonstrated a small left pneumothorax
after the procedure.  A chest tube was placed, with reduction in
the size of the pneumothorax, and was later pulled prior to
transfer back to the cardiology floor.
.
# Pneumothorax: As noted above, patient developed a ptx after PM
placement.  A chest tube was placed and repeat CXRs showed
gradual resolution of the ptx. She was discharged on 3
additional days of Keflex after having cefazolin in house to
prevent infection.
.
# CAD:  Patient had no evidence of ischemia.  Per report, she
had a negative stress MIBI in [**9-27**] though there is no
documentation in OMR.  She was continued on her outpatient
regimen except as described above with intermittent cessation of
metoprolol during hypotension.
.
# Hypertension: Normotensive during hospitalization except for
episode of hypotension during PM placement.  Of note, she was
previously on CCB, ACEi, and BB, but the ACEi was discontinued
during initial treatment for syncope, before she was diagnosed
with Mobtiz type I. Amlodipine was held for hypotension and
lisinopril was started. She was discharged on this regimen.
Amlodipine can be restarted if her blood pressures are difficult
to control, but they were stable this admission.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on simvastatin
.
# Osteoporosis: Continued on outpatient regimen with Ca/Vit D,
bisphosphanate
.
# Stool impaction: Had fecalithe in rectal vault. Was manually
disempacted without bleeding or complications on [**2129-12-21**].
Afterwards had warm tap water enema. She was discharged with
senna and colace.
