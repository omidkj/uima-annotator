Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
neck pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Anterior cervical corpectomy, C6-C7,
Inferior C5 and superior T1 with anterior canal decompression,
Fibular strut graft placement,
Autograft placement and anterior plate placement.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is 89 yo woman who underwent decompressive
laminectomy at C3-7
with posterior instrumented fusion using bilateral mass screws
C5-6 and C7-T1 on [**2105-4-6**] after a fall. She was discharged to a
rehab facility. She was then seen in followup in my office in
complaint of persistent neck pain as well as the development of
a cervical hump. The patient was worked up including a CT scan
and flexion-extension films. It was found that the patient had
intact, sharp splinting of the cervical spine from C5-T1
bilaterally. There was intact C1-2 articulation. There is
adequate posterior decompression, C3-7. However, there is
anterior wedge compression fracture at C7 with loss of cervical
lordosis and kyphotic angulation secondary to collapse of the
anterior elements. We have therefore extensively counseled the
family that the patient requires a second surgical stabilization
procedure. Surgical risks and benefits were explained in detail
and the family was counseled at length. We have recommended a C7
anterior cervical corpectomy with instrumented fusion and
placement of a strut graft with plating. The patient has to
remain in a hard collar at all times until this procedure has
been performed. The family will come back to us with a decision
to be made within the next two weeks. We have presented the case
in consultation to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 548**], neurosurgical spine
specialist, for reconfirmation. The patient will benefit from a
stabilization procedure and returned on [**-8/7210**]  for elective
surgery.

Pertinent Results:
CT C-spine: Status post placement of a fibular strut graft with
C6 and C7 anterior corpectomy. An anterior fusion plate was also
placed from C5 through T1.

C-spine x-ray: Several spinal needles were placed in an
antegrade fashion into lower cervical spine disc spaces. On the
most recent film, spinal needles overlie the inferior end plate
of C4, superior end plate of C5, within the disc space of C5/6
and the most caudal spinal needle overlies the region of T1. The
most caudal needle is not well seen due to the overlap of soft
tissues from the shoulders. Corresponding to the patient's prior
CT of the cervical spine, there is an anterior compression
fracture of C7 resulting in a kyphotic deformity. Multilevel
posterior fusion rods and pedicle screws are present from C5
through T1.

EKG: Sinus rhythm
PR interval prolonged (240ms)
Low limb lead voltage
Extensive ST-T changes are nonspecific
Since previous tracing, heart rate increased, inferior ST-T wave
abnormalities more marked

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo woman who had a fall in [**3-16**] and underwent decompressive
laminectomy C3-C7 as well as Posterior instrumented fusion using
bilateral mass screws  and rods from C5, C6, C7, T1 on [**2105-4-6**].
She discharged to rehab on [**2105-4-10**]. She has been followed up in
clinic, posterior insicion healed very well. On the follow ups
she complaint of neck pain it felt to be pseudoarthrosis related
to C7 vertebral body fracture with loss of cervical lordosis
status post trauma. Patient both evalautred by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 548**] as a second opinion, came to agreement bring her in for C7
corpectomy and instrumented fusion after extensive discussion
with family and patient.

Patient electively admitted to neurosurgery on [**2105-8-14**] for
anterior cervical corpectomy, C6-C7, inferior C5 and superior T1
with anterior canal decompression,
fibular strut graft placement, autograft placement and anterior
plate placement under general anesthesia. The patient was woken
up from general anesthesia.  Patient
was hemodynamically stable throughout.  The patient did well.
The patient was taken from the operating room to the PACU
intubated for further observation. An Aspen collar was placed to
keep the patient stable. Estiamted blood loss is 300cc. Patient
successfully extubated on postop day one. She had some
swallowing difficulty postsurgery which is expected, restarted
IV flids. She had a speech and swallow evaluation on [**8-17**] due to
large of oral secretions unable to do her spech &swallow eval,
therefore Dophoff placed for nutrition.

On [**2105-8-17**] around 11pm she stopped responding about 2 minutes,
with fixed gaze, and expressive aphasia about 10 minutes.
Patient tranferred to ICU for overnight observation, and
management of her secretions.at the time of the event her BP
150/80, HR;88, RR:18, SpO2;96%RA. Blood glucose;113mg/dl.
Patient had no further episode in ICU, and transferred to
step-down on [**8-18**]. Her hematocrit has been stable until between
20-30 post surgery, on [**8-18**] her hct dropped to 24.3 she is
transfused with 1 unit of PRBC, premedicated with acetaminophen
and benadryl, lasix end of the transfusion. Her hct came up to
28.2 post transfusion. Her guiac was positive times two.

Patient reevalauted by speech therapist on [**8-18**] and she failed,
she reevaluated again on [**8-21**] and it was recommended that she
stay NPO and follow-up with a speech and swallow at rehab. She
still has dophoff for nutrition for now, dietian following for
her calori needs.

Patient seen and evalauted by physical therapy and recommended
rehab stay.
