Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Dilantin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
51 y/o F w/COPD (FEV1 31%, multiple intubations in past), Hep C,
hx IVDA, who presented to the ED tonight with SOB x several
days.  On [**2184-3-13**], she called her [**Date Range 19039**] c/o sinus
congestion and rhinorrhea and was told she likely had a viral
URI.  This improved with symptomatic treatment with Advil Cold &
Sinus.  She called back on [**2184-3-22**] with a persistent cough and
increased sputum production (yellow).  At that point she was
given a z-pack and a one-week course of prednisone (40 mg
daily).  She finished the prednisone yesterday.  Since then, she
has had continued productive cough and worsening SOB.  Of note,
her nebulizer prescription was changed from four times per day
to once daily, so she has not been using her nebs as often.
*
In the ED, she was initially saturating 86% on RA.  After an
albuterol nebulizer, she improved to 94%.  She was also given
prednisone 60 mg and azithromycin.  She was admitted to medicine
for further management.


Past Medical History:
1. COPD, followed in Pulmonary by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Most recent
spirometry [**11-11**] revealed FEV1 of 1.13 (45% pred), FVC 2.58 (79%
pred), and FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.44.  Improved from prior in [**4-11**].
 Full PFTs from [**10-12**] also showed diffusion capacity 45% pred.
Exercise oximetry showed O2 sat 88%RA at rest, which decreased
to 80% w/ambulation.  ABG at that time 7.34/56/52 on RA.
2. Hep C, being monitored
3. Hx IVDA, on methadone maintenance
4. Hx seizure d/o

Social History:

Pertinent Results:
CXR:  hyperinflated.  no pna.
.
CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or dissection.
2. Mild emphysematous changes in the lungs, with mild scarring
and basilar mild atelectasis.
3. Hiatal hernia.
.
CT head:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of mass effect or hemorrhage.
There is no displacement of normally midline structures. There
is no evidence of a focal extra-axial lesion or fluid
collection. Ventricles and sulci are not remarkable. [**Doctor Last Name **] and
white matter are not unusual. The visualized paranasal sinuses
are clear.
.
Echo:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
6.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2182-10-15**], mitral regurgitation is now
present.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 51 y/o F w/hx COPD who presents with increased sputum
production and SOB, c/w her usual COPD exacerbations.
*
##  COPD exacerbation:  This was likely triggered by a viral URI
and in the setting of under-using her nebulizer. She was started
on prednisone 60 mg daily with plans to use a longer taper as
she got worse so quickly after stopping the last time.
Azithromycin was continued for a five-day course. Neb treatments
were given prn. She remained stable on room air and intermittent
1L O2 with goal O2 sats 88-92%. She was able to maintain these
levels most of the time, with some desaturation to 85% on
ambulation. On [**4-5**] patient became somnolent and combative
repeat ABG showed increased CO2 retention.  Patient was
subsequently transferred to MICU for closer observation.
Patient was started on CPAP @ night with great improvement in
her mental status.  Patient did not require other antibiotics as
her WBC remained normal while on steroids and she was never
febrile with clear CXR.  Patient slowly improved and was
maintaining sats >91-92% with ambulation upon discharge.
Patient is to continue using her BIPAP @ [**9-10**] @ home.  She is to
continue her prednisone taper and will follow up with her
[**Month/Day (4) 19039**]
*
## Confusion - patient became suddenly somnolent on [**4-5**].  The
sudden onset of her symptoms was concerning for overmedication
however patient had not received anything for 8 hours prior
except Tylenol.  UTox and serum tox were negative.  ABG showed
increasing CO2 retention.  Patient was very angry when asked
about potential drug abuse and she was upset that this
assumption recurs as patient often mistaken her hypercarbia for
intoxication.  Her mental status quickly improved with
initiation of BIPAP @ night with improvement in her CO2 levels.
.
## MR - patient was found to have 2+ MR.  The etiology of her MR
remains unclear as she had no evidence of overwhelming LVH and
no evidence of ischemia.  Patient was counseled to take
antibiotic prophylaxis when undergoing dental work or other
invasive procedures.
.
## urinary frequency: She reports increasing urinary frequency
and also symptoms that may be consistent with an element of
urinary retention. She was on a medication prescribed by her PCP
~8 months ago that may have been Detrol. Her UA was
unremarkable, and her UCx grew <10,000 organisms.
*
## Hep C:  Genotype 2, stage I fibrosis on biopsy.  No
interferon per hepatology [**3-11**] pulmonary disease.
*
## IVDA: She was continued on her methadone maintenance.  She
reports she has had her dose increased from 60 mg to 70 mg
recently; however, no records in the OMR confirm this so she was
continued on 60mg.
*
## Seizure d/o: Keppra was continued.
.
Patient will follow up with her [**Month/Day (2) 19039**].
