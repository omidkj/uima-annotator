ECHO [**2116**] - preserved reg global biV systolic function. Mild AR.
  Mild-mod MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] systolic htn.
CXR [**11-2**] - Chronic changes related to tuberculosis within the
left upper lobe.  No new parenchymal consolidation or overt
edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
78yoM COPD, hx aspiration PNAs admitted f/Stonehedge NH for
fevers, hypoxia, likely aspiration with septic shock.
.
# Shock - fevers with mildy+ UA and no CXR consolidation but
clinical hx of aspiration, recent history of CDiff, persistently
low BPs in ED with mild BP support.  No luekocytosis, no
bandemia.  Lactic acidosis marked.  Vanco/zosyn started for
broad coverage of MRSA and resistant GNRs.  Added flagyl for
empiric Tx of CDiff colitis given recent Abx.  Started hydrocort
50q6, given chance of adrenal insufficency. Gave IVF as needed
for hypotension
.
# Respiratory failure - no CXR evidence of infiltrate or
pulmonary edema, no history of overt failure by ECHO in [**2116**].
Does have questionable hx of aspiration events.  Covered for
pneumonia with vanco and zosyn.  sputum cultures pending, with
frequent suctioning.  Started yoscyamine to addres increase
sputum production
.
# Renal failure - markedly decreased clearance since last
admission, likely pre-renal from hypovolemic shock, element of
ATN.  Scant UOP since admit.  Give IVF to encourage renal output
.
# Elevated CEs - [**1-31**] to strain with hypovolemia + renal failure.
 Trend CE's and do EKG
.
# Hypernatremia - Profound
.
# fEN/PPx - ppi, pneumoboots, sq heparin, npo.
.
# COMM - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**] has [**Last Name (STitle) 653**] patient's daughter earlier
in the evening regarding patient unlikely to survive this severe
insult.
.
# CODE - DNR/DNI, no pressors, documented by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**] in
note.  Spoke with daughter who wanted to make patient [**Name (NI) 3225**].
After [**Name (NI) 3225**] order, pt was starated on morphine drip for
comfort,and antibiotics and further lab draws were d/c.  PT
passed later that day with sudden arrest.  His daughter was
[**Name (NI) 653**] about the death
