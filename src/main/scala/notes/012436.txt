History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 74903**] has a high-grade airway obstruction due to fractured

silicone stent was placed inside the metal stent.  The patient

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 74904**]
Reason: Evaluate for aspiration

   [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old woman with new trach/swelling
   REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for aspiration



Final Report
CLINICAL HISTORY:  80-year-old female with new tracheostomy and
swelling.
Evaluate for aspiration.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW:  Study done in conjunction with
speech and
swallow division.  Multiple consistencies of barium were
administered to the
patient under constant video fluoroscopy.  Oral phase showed
mild impairments
in bolus control and formation.  Pharyngeal phase showed normal
palatal
elevation, laryngeal elevation and valve closure.  Note was made
of consistent
penetration with thin liquids secondary to delay in initiation
of swallow.  No
aspiration was detected.

IMPRESSION:  Penetration without evidence of aspiration.

MRSA PNA detected at OSH. She was admitted to the ICU for close

[**2136-11-14**] the patient underwent a flexible and rigid bronchoscopy
for removal of silicone and fractured metal stent. The patient
remained intubated following the procedure d/t trauma to the
airway from removal of metal stent which was imbeded in the
airway. On [**2136-11-16**] the patient underwent flexible and rigid
bronchoscopy for removal of remaining metal fragments and for a
definitive airway. A #8 portex trach was placed. She weaned
readily from the vent to trach mask and was transfered to the
floor. She passed her swallow eval w/o evidence of aspiration
and was [**Last Name (un) 1815**] reg diet thin liquids and soft solids. She
