Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
79 yo female with a history of metastatic thymic cancer s/p
palliative chemo, stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer s/p
Cyberknife therapy, asthma, HTN, insulin resistance presents
with dyspnea. Patient was originally admitted to CCU, but is now
transferred to MICU for management of suspected septic shock.
Per the patient's record, the patient felt acute dyspnea
yesterday evening. This episode was followed by acute chest
discomfort located in the substernal region and was brought in
by her son. Of note, the patient has had a recent admission for
asthma/bronchiectasis and possible radiation pneumonitis. At
that time she was on aztreonam and azithromycin (given
penicillin allergy for coverage of pseudomonas)
.
In the ED, initial VS were HR 135 BP 155/92 O2 82% on RA. Her
physical exam was consistent with pulmonary edema. EKG revealed
tachycardia with aberancy (left bundle pattern) new compared to
prior. Cardiology was consulted. Labs revealed elevated BNP at
1381 (prior 792), trop 0.16, WBC of 13.8, normal UA. CXR
revealed bilateral fluffly infiltrates, more dense infiltrates
in the right upper lobe, bilateral effusions. She was given
nitro drip, lasix, aspirin, morphine, eventually cefepime,
vanco, methylprednisone. She was placed on CPAP however her
symptoms did not improve. The decision was made to intubate.
.
The ED resident had a difficult time intubating, with copious
frothy bloody fluid from the ET tube. She had an episode of
hypoxia while attempting to replace ET tube down to the 60s.
Eventually the patient was successfully intubated by anesthesia
by a fiberoptic. She was given propofol during intubation and
then sedated with fentanyl/midaz following. Initial ABG
following intubation revealed respiratory acidosis (7.17 pCO2 65
pO2 117 HCO3 25), however after increasing tidal volume and
rate, ventilatory efforts have improved (pH 7.34 pCO2 32 pO2 68
HCO3 18 with a Lactate of 5.3).
.
There was concern for LBBB on EKG initially, but cardiology
fellow felt this was more consistent with sinus rhythm w/
aberrancy. Cardiology fellow performed bedside echo which
demonstrated globally decreased function with questionable wall
motion abnormality of anterior and septal walls with trivial
pericardial effusion and no impairment of the RV, new compared
to normal echo in [**2114**]. Cardiology recommended heparin, however
the patient has not had head imaging recently so heparin was
held until Head CT could be performed. Prior to leaving for CT
scanner the patient's blood pressure dropped. Despite pulmonary
edema, the patient was given 2L IVF and started on levophed. A
central femoral line was placed. The patient was also sent for
Chest CT prior to arrival in the CCU.
.
In CCU, patient started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl for pneumonia.
She was started on vasopressin after maximal levophed.  She is
transferred to MICU for further management of shock.

.
CXR: [**12-15**] - There are bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater
than left. Additionally, there is increased opacification within
the right
upper lobe, which is new since [**2116-12-3**], as well as in
bilateral
lung bases which likely represent pneumonia. There is mild
cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Sternotomy wires are midline
and intact.
.
CTA Chest: 1. No central pulmonary embolism.
2. Post-radiation fibrotic changes within the right lung.
Additionally, a
small right-sided pleural effusion and trace left-sided pleural
effusion is noted. Adjacent compressive atelectasis in bibasilar
lungs is noted;
additionally, new foci of consolidative process within bilateral
lung bases may represent aspiration/pneumonia.
3. No acute aortic pathology identified.
.
CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process. MRI would be
more sensitive for metastatic disease, if indicated.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo female with a history of metastatic thymic cancer s/p
palliative chemo, stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer s/p
Cyberknife therapy, asthma, HTN, insulin resistance admitted to
hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
# Septic/Cardiogenic Shock: Strongly suspect infectious source
of shock, given evidence of multifocal pneumonia on chest CT.
However, concern for possible cardiac etiology as well, given
depressed EF, though this could alternatively be due to
myocardial stunning from sepsis. Placed on coverage for HCAP
with meropenem/vancomycin/levaquin. Placed on coverage for PCP
pneumonia with bactrim + steroids, and aspergillus with
voriconazole given recent positive sputum culture and nodules on
CT scan. Covered for Cdiff with both IV flagyl and PO vancomycin
given history of Cdiff infection and current distended abdomen.
The patient was started on levophed and vasopressin, as well as
dobutamine for ionotropic effect. Cultures of sputum returned
after the patient's passing and were (+) for MRSA, which was
vancomycin-sensitive.
.
# Hypercarbic/Hypoxia respiratory failure: The patient has a
