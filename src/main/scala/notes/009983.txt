History of Present Illness:
58 y/o M with history of alcoholic cirrhosis (grade I varices on
nadolol, recent GI bleed at [**Location (un) **], mutliple paracentesis,
never had SBP) who presented with hepatic encephalopathy,
developed hematemesis while on [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**], and transferred to
ICU for further management.

He initially presented with dyspnea for the past few days to
weeks and altered mental status. No ligthheadedness, cough,
fever. Complains of abdominal pain to palpation. Of note, the
patient reports still drinking. He says his last drink was
[**2172-5-6**].

In the ER, intial vitals 97.3, BP 110/50, 70, 18, 96% RA. he was
given 2L NS, Kayexalate 30g PO, Lactulose 30mg PO, Levofloxacin
750mg IVx1 and flagyl 500mg IV x1 to treat hepatic

STUDIES:
=========
ABDOMINAL U/S [**5-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited evaluation of hepatic parenchyma with moderate
ascites noted.
Please note that diffuse and more advanced liver disease (i.e.,
hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis) cannot be excluded on this study.
2. Limited Doppler evaluation of the liver with to-and-fro
portal vein flow again suggestive of portal hypertension.

ABDOMINAL XRAY [**5-13**]
IMPRESSION: Multiple dilated loops of small bowel, concerning
for  obstruction.

ABDOMINAL U/S [**5-18**]
IMPRESSION: Moderate four-quadrant ascites. Right lower quadrant
largest
pocket marked for paracentesis to be performed by the clinical
team.

ABDOMINAL XRAY [**5-19**]
IMPRESSION: Worsened appearance of small bowel obstruction.

CT ABD/PELVIS [**5-20**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly dilated loops of small bowel which decompress in the
distal ileum, without evidence of a discrete transition point.
2. New right greater than left small pleural effusions and
adjacent
atelectasis.

RENAL U/S [**5-26**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally, as
questioned. A
small echogenic focus at the right interpolar region shows no
shadowing, and may represent a small crystal or early
atherosclerotic change within a renal artery branch.
Large-volume ascites.

CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS [**5-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased patchy opacities in the bilateral lungs with
bibasilar
consolidations concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
2. No evidence of obstruction.
3. Persistent ascites, unchanged.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy as described above which may be
reactive.

TTE [**6-5**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2171-10-28**], the left ventricle
now appears hyperdynamic.
IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen, but technically
suboptimal study

PORTABLE CXR [**2172-6-25**]
Feeding tube and central venous catheter remain in place.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Widespread bilateral
alveolar and interstitial opacities have slightly worsened in
the interval and may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, with or
without superimposed process such as infection or aspiration.

UPPER ENDOSCOPY [**2172-5-13**]: Multiple Grade II varices were seen in
the esophagus at the GE junction. There were stigmata of recent
bleeding with some oozing of one varix. 4 bands were
successfully placed.

UPPER ENDOSCOPY [**2172-6-17**]: 3 cords of grade II varices were seen
in the gastroesophageal junction. 3 bands were successfully
placed.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiatio
