History of Present Illness:
53M etoh cirrhosis (MELD 37), CAD, COPD, presents from OSH with
acute renal failure and confusion. He was diagnosed with
cirrhosis about a year ago. He has been followed by hepatology
at [**State 792**]Hospital. Recent meld was 24 in [**12-10**] with cr
1.2, INR 1.8, and t. bili 9.1. The patient routine labs drawn on
[**3-23**] which showed a Cr of 5.5. He was called by his physician
and asked to come to the ED on [**3-24**].

At OSH, he was being treated with vanc, although uncleear about
the actual or suspected source of infection. Paracentesis was
considered but not done as he did not have obvious ascites on
exam. The pt arrived in stable condition, satting 100 on RA,
appearing comfortable. He was A+O x3 and appropriate with very
mildly slurred speech, though no asterixis.

Seen and evaluated by transplant medicine team on [**3-28**]. The
patient states that he was feeling at his baseline. However, he
was unable to provide detailed history about his medical
problems. [**Name (NI) **] wife, he has been very forgetful over the past few
months with increasing confusion. He is fairly independent at
home and able to carry out routine ADLs. He always complains of
thirst and has been staying well hydrated with fluids. However,
he has had tea-colored urine for the past few months. Over the
last few weeks, he began to have decrease in appetite with
intermittent episodes of nausea, non-bilious, non-bloody emesis.
The wife feels the increased fullness is from an increase in
abdominal girth also over the same period of time. He has not
had alcohol since he stopped about 1 year ago. He denies any
SOB, fevers, chills, myalgias. ROS is positive for BRBPR which
has intermittently although he has had a negative w/u including
EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] which showed only hemorrhoids, adenomas and portal
gastropathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for further evaluation of
ARF, MELD 32.
Patient seen by Renal, Hepatology while on Medicine service.

Patient remained confused since his admission (encephalopathic).
 Urine ouptut was low. Lasix was not helpful. He required
intermittent hemodialysis via temporary hemodialysis catheter.

On [**4-2**] (HD6) a renal biopsy was performed. He received 3 bags
of platelets and 3 units of FFP prior to the biopsy on [**4-2**] with
a platelet count of 86,000, INR 1.7.
Following the biopsy, he became diaphoretic with chest pain. His
Hct was 23.9% and dropped to 21% post-procedure with a platelet
count of 107,000.  He received 2 more units of PRBC, 2 units of
plt, and DDAVP and was then transferred to the ICU.
In the first 24 hours of being in the ICU, he received 8 units
of PRBCs without
any response in his Hct (stable at 24%), 10 units of FFP, 4 bags
of platelets, DDAVP 75mcg (total), Vit K (5mg), and
cryoprecipitate administered. He went to IR for embolization of
suspected renal bleed, but tolerated this poorly with 9/10 chest
pain with ST depression in anterior leads. A nitro drip was
started. CK was 1326, MB 163 and troponin 5.[**Street Address(2) **]
depression.  He sustained an anterior NSTEMI.
CT of abdomen done on [**4-3**] showed an unchanged large left
perinephric hematoma.
Due to his continued blood requirement, he was brought to the
operating room for urgent left nephrectomy. Patient transferred
back to the ICU post-op. PLease see the operative [**Last Name (un) **] for
further details. No obvious area of bleeding could be found on
the kidney.  For further details of the procedure, see operative
dictation. Hct remained stable post nephrectomy. JP fluid output
was initially high. This decreased over time.

Of note, the kidney biopsy demonstrated IgA nephropathy.There
was also ongoing transplant evaluation for liver transplant. At
issue was cardiac clearance given PMH of angina. Cardia echo
revealed mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There was mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. LVEF was >55%. Cardiac
cath was deferred. Stress MIBI was performed on [**4-15**]. Findings
showed no evidence of reversible ischemia or clinical symptoms
of angina. Recommendations included continuation of asa qd,
continuation of beta blockers, and initiation of captopril with
up titration of dose. If tolerated, captopril could be switched
to lisinopril 5mg qd. IV BB was recommended perioperatively
should he undergo further surgery.

Tube feedings were administered via an NG tube that was in place
postop nephrectomy. The nasogastric tube was self d/c'd. Calorie
counts suggested that he was only meeting 50% of his needs.
Ensure plus was given tid. Calorie counts were continued for
eval of further need for tube feedings. Calorie counts ________.


Neurologically he experienced varying degrees of
encephalopathy. Lactulose was given. A psyche consult was
obtained for evaluation of judgement given that he refused
treatments on [**4-13**]. Recommendations included 1:1 sitter,
identification of source of delerium and prn haldol. Haldol was
not given. Rifaximin was resumed to decrease encephalopathy. He
continued to present with a waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]
delerium/encephalopathy. During this time he was verbally
abusive to his wife and staff.

On [**2161-4-16**] The temporary hemodialysis catheter was changed to a
tunnelled HD line without complications.  An outpatient
hemodialysis center was located in [**Last Name (un) 30514**], R.I.
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 71884**]). Patient received hemodialysis on Friday [**4-17**]
prior to discharge.
