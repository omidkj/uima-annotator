Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
facial edema, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**12-15**]: Craniectomy and wound washout


History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 yo M with an extensive neurosurgical history after
undergoing resection of hemangiopericytoma (a rare meningeal
tumor with high risk of recurrence) in [**2196**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] with
post-operative course complicated by hardware-associated MRSA,
recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for cranioplasty and found to
have recurrent disease requiring placement of an external
ventricular drain for bleeding into the ventricles, subsequently
discharged to rehab in [**2198-10-19**] and seen for follow-up in
[**2198-11-19**] in good condition - and who now re-presents with
facial edema and cough with head CT showing no peri-operative
complications.
.
His pertinent past surgical history leading up to the current
hospitalization is as follows:
- [**6-/2196**]: Diagnosed with and underwent resection for
hemangiopericytoma of L frontal lobe
- [**2196-9-29**]: Craniolasty with synthetic bone graft c/b MRSA,
removal of graft, 6 week course of vancomycin
- [**6-/2197**]: tumor recurrence near anterior falx -> cyberknife
- [**8-/2197**]/[**2198**]: Scalp expanders -> removal of expanders
- [**9-/2198**]: Cranioplasty & found to have tumor recurrence in
posterior fossa with 4th ventrical obstruction -> External
Ventricular Drain placed and removed, treated with
Vanc/Ceftriaxone
- [**10/2198**]: Discharged on no antibiotics to rehab
- [**2198-11-28**]: Discharged home from rehab
- [**2198-12-4**]: Seen by plastics with no post-op problems
.
Two days prior to presentation he started developing swelling of
his face and redness of his face that started around both eyes.
The day of admission the swelling and redness worsened. Of note,
saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], his plastic surgeon, on [**12-4**] because of wife's
concern for fluid draining from where a suture was removed on
his scalp; Dr.[**Name (NI) 27488**] note reflects a punctate area that was
healing with no evidence of seroma, cellulitis, or erythema.
.
His family notes that he has not had pain, fevers, chills,
vision problems, nausea, vomiting, or mental status change. He
has had a chronic cough, which started in [**Month (only) **] when he
developed and was treated for a pneumonia in the ICU
post-operatively; the cough has been improving since then.
.
Since he has returned from rehab, his wife notes that he has
been walking with a cane short distances in the home. He has
been eating and drinking more or less on his own with
supervision from his wife and 2 twin 22 year old daughters.
PT/OT and speach/swallow therapy have been seeing him at home as
well; otherwise he cared for by his family, who have rearranged
their schedule accordingly. His mental status has also been
stable - he responds appropriately to his wife and can
communicate in words but does not say much. His weight has been
stable according to his wife, and overall, she believes he has
been slowly showing signs of improvement since his discharge.
.
Of note, his wife reports that he has had PEG tubes in the past,
once after his surgery in [**2196**] and again after his most recent
surgery at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2198**]; both times he pulled the PEG tubes
because of discomfort. His wife also notes that he used to love
cooking and now enjoys eating food.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 100.4, HR 98, BP 118/89, RR
16, SaO2 98% RA. He was evaluated by neurosurgery and plastic
surgery. Neurosurgery recommended Head CT which showed frontal
subgaleal soft tissue edema without underlying fluid collection
or abscess; neurosurgery recommended discharge home with follow
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Plastics evaluated the patient and recommended
IV vancomycin and admission to medicine. The patient was given 1
gram IV vancomycin and was admitted to medicine.
.
