Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**]
Chief Complaint:
Patient with progressive shortness of breath with new
O2 requirement, LUL mass and left pleural effusion.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Medical thoracoscopy on the left side, Pleural biopsy, Tube
thoracostomy, 24-French, left side.


History of Present Illness:
74 year old female with history of endometrial cancer status
post
TAHBSO and brachytherapy who began having shortness of breath in
[**Month (only) 116**].  At the same time the patient began having back pain as
well
as a pleuritic-type pain in her "left lung".  Patient had an
abnormal chest xray which led to a CT scan that revealed 2.2 x
1.7 cm left upper lobe mass, several areas of right pleural
density adjacent to RUL and RLL with the largest being at the
lower lobe posterolaterally measuring 3 x 1.4 cm and a moderate
left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis.  She had a
bronchoscopy at an OSH where there were no endobronchial lesions
and the lesion in the LUL was biopsied (no malignant cells).
PET
scan revealed FDG uptake within multiple pleural deposits as
well
as the slips of the diaphragm and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Also noted was some increased avidity in the lower pelvis.
Patient also has a new O2 requirement.  She reports limited
activity tolerance, cannot lie flat and still has the left
pleuritic pain.


Past Medical History:
NIDDM
HTN
Hyperlipidemia
Asthma
Status post cholecystectomy
Endometrial cancer, status post TAHBSO, brachytherapy


Social History:
Married.  Lives with husband.  Does not drink ETOH, has never
smoked.  She was a housewife for many years.  Husband owned a
woodworking/wood pattern shop.


Family History:
Mother had asthma, Father died from TBI, sister
had lymphoma.

Final Report
EXAM: CT chest [**2174-5-24**].

INDICATION: Pleural effusion, left upper lobe lung nodules and
multiple
pleural-based nodules. Please evaluate for malignancy and
lymphadenopathy.

COMPARISON: None available at time of study interpretation.

TECHNIQUE: Volumetric ct of the chest without IV contrast.

FINDINGS: There are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to
large on the
left, and small on the right. Within the left pleural fluid,
there are
heterogeneous areas of increased density, suspicious for pleural
nodules.
Several discrete pleural or pleural-based nodules marginate the
left
mediastinal pleura including 1.9 cm nodule (2, 25), 2.9 cm
nodule (2, 28), and
2.1-cm nodule (2, 30).

The right pleural effusion is homogeneous, and relatively low in
density (4
[**Doctor Last Name **]). No definite nodularity is seen in the right pleural
effusion, though
there is a serous density, 1.8 cm pleural-based nodule higher in
the right
hemithorax, located along the lateral right pleural surface (2,
20), and a 3.5
x 1.7-cm anterior, softtissue nodule (2, 44) difficult to
differentiate
between a very inferior pleural nodule and a subdiaphragmatic
nodule.

Several scattered parenchymal nodules in the right upper lobe
measure up to 5
mm (2, 25). Fissural nodularity between the right upper and
lower lobes at the
same level is 1.3 cm long. Atelectasis at the lung bases
bilaterally, left
greater than right, is likely related to passive compression
from adjacent
pleural effusion. Aerated portions of the left lung are grossly
clear.

Heart is not enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion, or
pericardial
nodule. There is mild atherosclerotic calcification of the
coronary arteries.

Central airways are patent to the subsegmental level.

This study is not specifically tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation. Note
is made however of moderate right hydronephrosis, which is
incompletely
imaged. There is a 1.3-cm nodule adjacent to the lateral
peritoneal wall in
the upper abdomen (2, 53). Several small subphrenic lymph nodes
are noted on
the right (2, 41), and there are scattered retrocrural and
retroperitoneal
lymph nodes, none of which meet CT size criteria for pathologic
enlargement.

There is no osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy.

IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion with irregular areas
of high
attenuation nodularity is concerning for pleural metastatic
disease.
Additional areas of nodularity adjacent to the left mediastinal
pleura, and in the right upper lobe are also worrisome for
malignancy. Comparison to previous imaging (per clinical notes a
PET-CT has been performed) would be extremely helpful for
correlating these findings.

2. Small right pleural effusion without discrete nodularity,
homogeneo
