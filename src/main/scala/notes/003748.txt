CT abd [**8-4**]:
Small bilateral pleural effusions and stable parenchymal
calcifications which may reflect amiodarone usage.
Cholelithiasis. Stable 1.3 cm left adrenal lesion statistically
representing an adenoma. Stable 2.2 cm septated right renal
cyst. Nodular liver reflecting underlying cirrhosis.
.
CXR [**8-4**]:
Small right pleural effusion. No evidence of congestive heart
failure. No focal infiltrates. There is a small right pleural
effusion. There is no left pleural effusion. Old rib fractures
of several right ribs are unchanged compared to [**2196-12-27**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course by Problem:
.
1) Acidosis: The patient was found to have an anion gap
metabolic acidosis with pH 7.28 in ED.  Ketones were noted in
his urine.  Gap in ED was 34 prior to fluids, improved to 19
after 2L NS in ED.  Delta delta is 22, so corrected bicarb is 30
- some component of metabolic alkalosis possibly from vomiting.
Differential diagnosis for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes
DM, alcohol, starvation - all of which are typically seen with
ketones as in this patient.  Lactic acidosis (also mildly
present here) caused by circulatory/respiratory failure, sepsis,
ischemic bowel, sz, liver failure - patient is hemodynamically
stable so makes these unlikely.  Ingestions also a possibility -
urine and serum tox negative.  Osmolar gap is 13, typically
osmole gap > 10 indicative of ingestion.  Likely a component of
starvation ketosis/ alcoholic ketosis and lactic acidosis in
setting of dehydration and renal failure.
.
Etiology was felt most likely [**12-28**] starvation ketosis (acute on
chronic), with possibility of some component of ingestion.  Pt
was hydrated with 2L IVF in ED, then given additional 3L IVF (2L
d5w + HCO3, 1L D5 NS) in MICU, with closure of GAP.  ethylene
glycol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol level were sent and were
unremarkable.  salicylates unremarkable. D lactate was not sent.

.
After being transferred form the MICU to the regular floor, the
patient's electrolytes were followed and remained stable.
.
2) EtOH abuse: The patient reports drinking two drinks each
night.  LFTs were within normal limits.  A CT scan showed signs
c/w likely cirrhosis.  The patient was treated with CIWA scale
for withdrawal symptoms (did not require any benzos), IV
thiamine, and folic acid.  B12, folate levels were normal.
Coags unremarkable, albumin c/w poor nutritional status.   The
patient was seen by social work.  He admitted to drinking more
than he should, but was not interested in AA or other programs.
He was given information on antabuse, which he will follow up
with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].  He also consented to meals on wheels
service, which will call him when he gets home for interview/set
up, and his wife will
