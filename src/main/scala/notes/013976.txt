HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year-old
male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease,
status post myocardial infarction in [**2131**], status post
3-vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2146**], atrial
fibrillation (on Coumadin), diabetes, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and hypercholesterolemia who presented to
an outside hospital with chest pain and jaw pain at rest on
[**1-11**].  The patient reported symptoms of upper
respiratory tract infection including wheezing and cough for
about one and a half weeks prior to his presentation.  He was
receiving Zithromax.  With increasing shortness of breath and
cough, the patient was seen by his primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
few days prior to admission and was started on a
prednisone 40-mg taper for presumed chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare.

On the evening of [**1-11**] the patient developed 3/10
chest pain at rest which was not relieved by sublingual
nitroglycerin.  The patient presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital and
received intravenous nitroglycerin and aspirin and became
pain free.  The patient's chest pain returned on [**1-12**]
in the evening with 7/10 chest pain.  The patient had
electrocardiogram changes including ST depressions in V3 to
V6 and inferiorly.  The patient also had increased lower
extremity swelling and orthopnea times one week.  Troponin
from the outside hospital went from 0.67 to 2.5, with a
creatine kinase of 411.  The patient was therefore
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2146**] with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous
vein graft to obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to ramus.
The patient had catheterization in [**2158-9-22**] which
showed native vessels were closed.  The patient had a patent
left internal mammary artery to a diffusely diseased left
anterior descending artery.  The patient had patent vein
grafts to obtuse marginal.  The patient also had patent
saphenous vein graft to ramus intermedius which received
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent.
 2.  Status post L4-L5 discectomy.
 3.  Hepatitis in [**2106**].
 4.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
 5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 6.  Insulin-dependent diabetes.
 7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 8.  Atrial fibrillation.
 9.  Hypothyroidism.
10.  Status post pacemaker.

q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.a.m.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN, ERYTHROMYCIN.  The patient is also
allergic to WALNUTS and EGGPLANT.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has never smoked and has never
used alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:   The patient has one brother and two sisters
with coronary artery disease, and family history is also
positive for diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission showed a heart rate of 82, respiratory rate
of 20, blood pressure 136/62, oxygen saturation of 90% to 92%
on shovel mask.  General examination revealed an elderly male
who was comfortable.  Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
examination revealed clear conjunctivae, moist mucous
membranes.  Pupils were equal and reactive to light
bilaterally.  Lung examination revealed coarse breath sounds
bilaterally in the upper respiratory zone.  There was
end-respiratory wheezes bilaterally.  There were decreased
breath sounds at the bilateral bases.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal
first heart sound and second heart sound.  There was a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at the apex.  Abdominal examination
revealed an obese and distended abdomen with mild suprapubic
tenderness.  There were normal active bowel sounds.  There
was no fluid wave.  The abdomen was nontender.  Extremity
examination revealed 2+ lower extremity pitting edema,
greater on the right than on the left.  The patient's right
groin contained a venous sheath.  The patient had 2+
left-sided dorsalis pedis pulses and 1+ right-sided dorsalis
pedis pulses.  Neurologic examination evaluated an awake and
oriented gentleman.  There were no frank motor or sensory
abnormalities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Mr. [**Known lastname **] was brought to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory on arrival.  Hemodynamics in the
laboratory revealed an arterial pressure of 144/70.  His left
ventricular pressure was 155/22.  Left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure was 37.  His pulmonary wedge pressure
was 30.  His right atrial pressure mean was 20.  His
pulmonary artery pressure was 46/30, and his right
ventricular pressure was 46/13 with a right ventricular
end-diastolic pressure of 20.

On coronary angiography the patient was found to have a
right-dominant system with 80% stenosis of left main coronary
artery, total occlusion of proximal left anterior descending
artery, total occlusion of the circumflex, total occlusion of
the right coronary artery with collaterals from left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery.  The
patient's native vessels were therefore all occluded.  In
terms of the vein grafts, the patient had one patent vein
graft to obtuse marginal.  His vein graft to ramus had a
proximal total occlusion.  The patient had a patent left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery
graft with distally diffusely disease left anterior
descending artery.

Intervention was attempted to reopen the total occlusion of
his vein graft to proximal ramus.  Two attempts were made,
and both were unsuccessful.  The patient was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit for furthering monitoring.

After arrival to the Coronary Care Unit, the patient
continued to receive tapering steroids for his presumed
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.  There was a
questions that his respiratory status was due to congestive
heart failure rather than worsening chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  The patient was also given Levaquin and
Flagyl for potential superinfection bronchitis.  The patient
was aggressively diuresed with high-dose intravenous Lasix as
well as Lasix drip.

After one day of diuresis the patient appeared to have
improvement in his congestive heart failure pattern on chest
x-ray on [**2160-1-14**].  The patient continued to
aggressively diuresed.  On [**2160-1-14**], the patient
started to complain of mild hemoptysis on coughing.  At this
time the patient was being weaned off his Coumadin.  He was
given intravascular vitamin K 1 g times three doses to
reverse his coagulopathy.  The patient was initiated on
intravenous heparin, maintained at low therapeutic range.
The patient was also given aspirin for his coronary artery
disease.

The patient had some elevation in his serum creatinine level
after catheterization which began to improve on [**2160-1-14**].  The patient was also initially placed on an insulin
drip for tight glucose control.  He was able to be weaned off
the insulin drip and restarted on his NPH and regular insulin
on [**2160-1-14**].

On the afternoon of [**2160-1-14**], the patient developed
another episode of chest pain with albuterol nebulizers.  On
electrocardiogram the patient was found to have a new left
bundle-branch block.  With this the patient was also noted to
have pacemaker misfiring which raised the question of either
decreased sensitivity or secondary to new onset myocardial
injury.  Elec
