Physical exam: +cough. Bilateral corneal reflexes. No eye
opening/commands. Face appears symmetric. PERRLA [**1-20**]. No
movement
in BUE and BLE to noxious stimuli.

Pertinent Results:
[**2174-11-17**] CTA:
1. Short interval progression of right frontal hematoma and
intraventricular extension of hemorrhage. Largely stable
subarachnoid hemorrhage along the falx, medial superior sulci,
inferior frontal lobe, and basal cisterns.
2. 2.5-mm aneurysm originating from the A2 segment with a faint
tail of
contrast tracking towards the intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
3. Unchanged obliteration of cerebral sulci and basal cisterns,
concerning for cerebral edema.
4. Incedential finding of multiple lung cysts that should be
further addressed by chest CT. Inhomogeneous thyroid with
abnormally reduced enhancement, suggestive of chronic thyroditis


[**2174-11-17**] CXR:
1. ET tube terminating 4.1 cm above the carina.
2. Orogastric tube within the stomach.
3. No acute intrathoracic process.

[**2174-11-18**] CT Brain:
1. Unchanged position of a right frontal approach
ventriculostomy catheter in comparison to [**2174-11-17**] 5:20
p.m. study.
2. Decreased visibility of blood products along the tentorial
leaflets. The remainder of the examination, including
demonstration of a large right frontal and vertex hematoma,
appears stable.

[**2174-11-18**] ECHO:
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque
to 35 cm from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic
valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or clinically-significant
valvular disease seen.

[**2174-11-19**] CTA Brain:
Wet Read: LLTc SAT [**2174-11-19**] 1:14 AM
NCCT: 1. New trace pneumocephalus along the right
ventriculostomy catheter. 2.
Unchanged ventriculostomy position. 3. New trace
intraventricular blood, possibly reflecting redistribution. No
change in the caliber of the ventricles. 4. Unchanged appearance
of the main right frontal and midline vertex hematoma and
frontal sulcal blood. 5. No new mass effect. CTA: No vasospasm
detected. No dissection seen. s/p left A2 segment ACA coiling.
3D reconstructions pending.

[**2174-11-20**] BUE Venous U/S:
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially occlusive thrombi within the left brachial and
cephalic veins.
2. No evidence for DVT of the right upper extremity.

[**2174-11-21**] TCD:
Impression: Abnormal TCD evaluation. Increased velocities in the
ACA bilaterally, MCA bilaterally, PCA bilaterally, vertebral
arteries, and basilar artery are most likely due to reactive
hyperemia or the effects of triple H therapy. There was no
vasospasm seen. Clinical correlation is needed.

[**2174-11-21**] Angiogram: No vasospasm

[**2174-11-22**] US UE
IMPRESSION: Occlusive thrombus seen within the left basilic
vein. No
thrombus identified within the deep veins of the left arm. Note
is made that the left cephalic vein could not be identified

[**2174-11-23**] CXR
In comparison with the study of [**11-21**], the monitoring and support
devices remain in place. Minimal indistinctness of pulmonary
markings could reflect some residual elevation of pulmonary
venous pressure. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST [**2174-11-24**]
Unchanged appearance of intraparenchymal hematoma compared with
[**2173-11-22**]. Ventricular drain and ICP monitoring device are
in
appropriate positions.

HEAD CT [**2174-11-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post craniotomy with expected post-surgical changes
including
pneumocephalus and effacement of cerebral sulci.
2. Persistence of intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and
intraventricular
hemorrhage. No evidence of new hemorrhage or infarction.
3. ICP monitoring device and ventriculostomy catheter have been
removed.
Interventional radiology coil is in stable position compared
with prior study.

HEAD CT [**2174-11-26**]:
IMPRESSION: No significant short interval change since [**11-25**], [**2174**] of extent of intraventricular and subarachnoid
hemorrhage with similar
degree of mass effect. No new hemorrhage or infarct.

LIVER/GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND [**2174-11-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) Gallbladder wall edema with layering stones/sludge. Edema is
nonspecific in the setting of documented hypoalbuminemia.
Pericholecystic fluid is nonspecific in the setting of a small
amount of abdominal ascites elsewhere.  If clinically indicated,
a HIDA scan would be beneficial to exclude acute cholecystitis.

2) Hyperechoic left hepatic lobe lesion measuring 1.8 cm. If
there is no
known history of liver disease, this likely represents a
hemangioma. If there is a history of liver disease, MRI or CT
would be indicated for further evaluation when clinically
feasible.
3) Incidental left and right pleural effusions noted.

LENIS [**2174-11-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
No right or left lower extremity DVT.

CTA HEAD [**2174-11-28**]:
HEAD CTA: Study is limited due to streaking artifact secondary
to surgical
staples. Of note, proximal vessels including vertebral and
carotid arteries
show a markedly reduced caliber compared with prior CTA. The
rotational
volume-rendered 3D-reconstructions show diffuse decrease in
caliber of the
vessels of the posterior and anterior circulation, without
evidence of
occlusion or new aneurysm.

IMPRESSION:
1. CT angiography of the head demonstrates diffuse decrease in
caliber and
irregulariy of proximal and distal vessels of both the anterior
and the
posterior circulation, compared with prior exam. This may be
related to
diffuse vasospasm, to decrease in blood flow to the brain due to
CNS
auto-regulatory mechanisms in the setting of decreased function,
or it mighft be secondary to inhibitory effect of induced
barbiturate coma. Technical issues may also have contributed to
this overall appearance.

2. Interval improvement of diffuse cerebral edem
