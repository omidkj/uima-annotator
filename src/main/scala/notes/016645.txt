Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14062**]
Chief Complaint:
ascities, lower extremity edema, weight gain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
87M with ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 30%), atrial fib/flutter,
DM2, extensive EtOH Hx (last drink 6 mo ago) who was seen in [**Hospital 191**]
clinic for progressive weight gain (baseline 175-180 lbs),
ascites, leg edema with SOB beginning ~1 wk ago. He notes
increased PO intake of canned soups at that time and regularly
eats hotdogs and deli meats. baseline activity is ambulating 30
steps; now minimal ambulation before SOB. Pt missed his ACE-I
dose yesterday but reports taking medications reliably. Has 2
pillow orthopnea, now uses 3 pillows. Denies any CP, fever,
nausea, vomiting.


Pt was most recently in the hospital in [**3-31**] for CHF
exacerbation. He was d/ced on coumadin at that time for planned
cardioversion after 1 month of anticoag. However, he presented
to the ED on [**2137-5-1**] with hematuria and was found to have INR of
9 so coumadin was stopped by his PCP.


Pt had a single episode of emesis of clear fluid in the ED,
another episode of reportedly blood-tinged vomitus, and then
~200cc maroon-colored emesis on the floor. Pt reports epigastic
"burning" since the last episode of emesis, non-radiating.
Denies abdom pain, LH, palpitations, BRBPR, or melena.


Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring where he
had another emesis of dark brown liquid (~200CC). Pt was started
on IV PPI. Given 1 unit of FFP. RUQ ultrasound showed moderate
ascites, enlarged spleen (15.6cm), splenorenal shunt, consistent
with portal hypertension; no ultrasonographic evidence of
cirrosis. EGD was performed which showed a Dieulafoy lesion in
the fundus which was cauterized, blood in stomach, esophagitis.
Serial hematocrits remained stable (29-30). Aspirin and plavix
were held. Antihypertensives initially held, but restarted on
low dose bb. Pt was hemodynamically stable. Total blood products
during hospitalization: 1 unit FFP, 1 unit PRBC. Pt was given
Vit K for elevated INR. Alpha feto protein was normal at 2.3.
Admission CXR without evidence of CHF. Echocardiogram on [**6-21**]
showed EF 45-50%, pulmonary hypertension, [**1-6**]+ MR, 3+ TR,
dilated RV with systolic/diastolic dysfunction c/w RV overload.
Pt was diuresed on [**6-23**] with po and IV Lasix.

-ECG: Aflutter @ 60 bpm, variable 1:1 to 1:3 flutter, low
voltages
.
Radiology:
-CXR: decreased right pleural effusion, no clear evidence of
CHF, no PTX or infiltrate.
.
-Abdominal ultrasound
IMPRESSION:
1. Splenomegaly, splenorenal shunt and ascites. The findings
indicate portal hypertension, and in fact, there is alternating
flow within the main portal vein.
2. The liver is slightly heterogeneous in echotexture, without
definite ultrasonographic evidence of cirrhosis.
3. Probable hemangiomas within the liver.
.
Echocardiogram:
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly
depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be
more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3.The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. There is abnormal diastolic
septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation
is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-6**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
87M with ischemic cardiomyopathy admitted w/periph edema and
ascites secondary to right heart failure. On admission pt
developed bloody emesis and found to have Dieulofoy lesion;
monitored in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and transferred to the floor. Hospital course
by issues as follows:
.
# Hematemesis: Etiology secondary to Dieulafoy lesion seen on
EGD [**2137-6-21**]. Initially received FFP and Vitamin K. Stable HD.
Slight decreased in hct to 28.7. Pt was transfused a total of
one unit for transfusion goal of 30 given his history of CAD.
Hct has remained stable. Aspirin and Plavix which was initially
held were restarted on [**6-24**]. Pt was continued on [**Hospital1 **] PPI.
.
# Burning Epigastric Pain: Per pt, started after 2nd episode of
emesis. Etiology was most likely secondary to emesis. DDx also
included anginal equivalent, PUD, pancreatitis, and other bowel
process. ECG w/o signif ST/TW changes. Card enzymes flat x3.
Epigastric pain resolved. Pt was continued on [**Hospital1 **] ppi.
.
# Elevated INR: Unclear etiology. Based on Abd U/S does not
appear to have cirrhosis. [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to nutritional
deficiency. Given FFP x1 and Vit K without significant
improvement in INR
.
# Ascites/abnormal abd U/S: Most likely related to CHF and fluid
overload. AFB normal. Given the question of malignant etiology
paracentesis was performed on [**6-25**]. Ascites fluid was negative
for SBP, SAAG 0.8 (not portal hypertension). Culture data was
negative. Cytology did not found any malignant cells.
.
# CHF: Pt was in decompensated right heart failure at admission
by exam & labs. Unclear etiology of acute episode, but possible
dietary indiscretion. Doubt ischemia-related or rhythm-related
given flat card enzymes and stable ECG/tele. Echocardiogram
showed an EF of 45-50% (likely less than this, given severe
valvular abnl). Pt maintained a stable respiratory status. Lasix
was initially held in setting of GIB, but was restarted on home
lasix dose.
.
# CAD: Pt has a P-MIBI in [**2-9**] w/large, predominantly
reversible, moderately severe defect but pt has deferred cath x2
while in hospital for CHF in [**2-9**] & [**4-9**] (but apparently would
consider as outpt). Initially ASA and Plavix were held, then
restarted. ACE-I was held, but restarted on [**6-2
