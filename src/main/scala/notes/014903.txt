Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxemia, olecranon bursitis, renal failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC [**2149-7-6**]
incision and drainage of abscess left elbow


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 31823**] is a 75 year old M w/ h/o CAD s/p CABGx3, DM, ESRD,
CHF, AF on coumadin, and SSS s/p PPM who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
from OSH with hypoxemia and concern for septic bursitis. Patient
presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**7-1**] from skilled care with
complaint of drainage from left elbow.  Plain films were not
suggestive of osteomylitis and patient was started on vancomycin
empirically for olecrenon bursitis. Cultures of fluid reportedly
grew MSSA (but also documented as resistant to penicillin) and
antibiotics were transitioned to zosyn.  Prior to this he had
been having swelling of his LUE after his AV fistula placement,
after his angioplasty a compression bandage was placed to help
with the swelling and not removed for an unknown period of time,
when removed skin was removed as well.  Shortly after this he
developed what sounds like a superficial cellulitis that
continued to progress.
.
Patient was transferred from OSH floor to ICU after developed
hypoxemia w/ worsening bilateral infiltrates on CXR. Blood gas
showed PaO2 of 45 on FIO250% on venti mask. Was diuresed with 80
mg lasix w/ UOP of 1850 and received another 80 mg of lasix this
AM w/ improvement of oxygenation with sats in high 90s on 6L.
Bilateral infiltrates were attributed to pulmonary edema
secondary to cardiac etiology (h/o CHF, reportedly preserved EF
on echo in past 6 months) vs. sepsis [**12-25**] bursitis. Patient has
been afebrile over past 24 hours, but with rising WBC count,
most recently 19.4. Blood pressures in the 90s-110s systolic,
with home anti-hypertensives held.
.
Plan was to I&D olecrenon bursitis pending INR reversal,
received vitamin K 10 mg x2 with improvement of INR from 3.27 to
1.74. However, patient also with acute on chronic kidney failure
(on HD , refusing to see [**Location (un) **] nephrologists, so was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. On transfer, afebrile, BPs
90s-110s, HR 110s-120s (atrial fibrillation), RR20s, O2 sat 99%
on 6L NC.
.
In the ICU initial VS were: 97.8, 128, 91/57, 24, 99% on NRB.
He was complaining of shortness of breath that is slowly
improving, denies any CP, n/v/d, abdominal pain, fever/chills.
Also complaining of some left arm pain with movement.

Imaging:
CXR [**7-3**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to most recent prior chest
radiograph [**2148-5-9**].
Moderate cardiomegaly, mediastinal widening. A small right
pleural effusion and interstitial abnormality predominantly in
the right lung are most readily explained by biventricular heart
failure. Intervening chest radiograph should be consulted to see
if this is consistent with the recent course. Transvenous right
atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are in expected
locations. No pneumothorax.
.
TTE [**7-4**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50%). There is considerable
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection
fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild
global systolic dysfunction. Mild right ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Minimal calcific aortic stenosis. Moderate mitral
and tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
