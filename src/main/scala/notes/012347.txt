CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ankle swelling, feeling weak.

SOURCE OF HISTORY:  The history is obtained from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] is a 64-year-old
Guatemalan man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and
smoking who was recently treated for bronchitis with
Azithromycin.  He presented to his primary care doctor on the
day of admission for followup.  He was noted to have
bilateral edema which developed over the past four days and a
heart rate greater than 150.  He was sent to the Emergency
Room at [**Hospital1 **]-Nishoba.  There his EKG and echocardiogram
were hemodynamically stable and he was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further care.  He reports
recent cough productive of sputum.  There was no fever or
chills.  He also complained of throat pain and soreness.  He
described orthopnea but no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He
denied chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, recent
weight loss, or chills.  He has never had a history of
cardiac disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history
of hypertension, cerebrovascular accident 15 years ago,
diabetes mellitus times six years, right eye injury, right
leg break, and PPD negative recently at his primary care
doctor's office.

MEDICATIONS:  Amaryl 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., Accupril,
Azithromycin, Glucotrol, and Hydrochlorothiazide.

ALLERGIES:  Not known.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with four children
and was recently in [**Location (un) 86**] from [**Country 7192**].  He was a teacher.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The family history is notable for liver
cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 99.6, blood pressure
100/70, heart rate 170 and irregularly irregular, and
respiratory rate 17.  The patient was saturating at 100% on 4
liters of oxygen.  In general, he appeared alert, awake, and
oriented times three lying comfortably.  He had a small right
pupil and the eye had a corneal scar.  The left pupil was
round and reactive.  Extraocular movements were normal.
Jugular venous pressure was elevated at 5 cm according to Dr.[**Name (NI) 34140**] note and 16 cm according to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  There were
no carotid bruits.  The thyroid was palpable.  There was no
lymphadenopathy.  The chest revealed a few bibasilar crackles
with good air movement bilaterally.  There was no dullness.
On cardiac examination, he had hyperdynamic precordium.
There was a systolic ejection murmur across the precordium as
well.  The abdomen was soft and nontender with normal bowel
sounds.  No spleen was palpable.  Guaiac was negative.  The
liver was palpable 3.4 cm below the costal margin.  The
extremities showed good distal pulses.  Neurologically,
cranial nerves II-XII were intact.  He had 5/5 strength
throughout.  There was a constant grimace and he had normal
speech.

LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS:  Sodium was 129, potassium 3.9,
chloride 90, bicarbonate 26, BUN 17, creatinine 0.5, glucose
308, white blood cell count 13.3, hematocrit 40.7, platelets
395,000.  Coagulation parameters were normal.  Magnesium was
1.8, albumin 2.6, calcium 8.5, CK 36.  At the outside
hospital he was noted to have elevated liver function tests
and alkaline phosphatase.  Troponin was less than 0.2.

An electrocardiogram revealed a rate of 170 in atrial
flutter.  There was normal axis and normal intervals with
left ventricular hypertrophy and J point elevation.

An echocardiogram obtained from [**Hospital1 **]-Nishoba Emergency
Room showed an ejection fraction of approximately 10%.  The
left ventricle was normal in size.  There was severe global
hypokinesis.  There was moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation.  The right ventricle showed severe global
hypokinesis.

A chest x-ray on [**2119-1-16**] showed a large heart
silhouette and right lower lobe mass.  On [**2119-1-24**],
he had a question of congestion and persistent right lower
lobe mass.

AST was 35, ALT 50, alkaline phosphatase 284, total bilirubin
0.4, TSH 1.2, free T4 1.2, serum iron level 30, TIBC 300, TRF
154.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] is a 64-year-old
man with new onset atrial flutter and severely depressed
cardiac function with evidence of congestive heart failure.
His hospital course can be summarized as follows.

Rhythm:  Initially Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] was in atrial flutter with 2:1
block at a rate of 133.  He was asymptomatic from this point
of view and hemodynamically stable.  He did not appear volume
overloaded initially.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was
obtained to assess for the possibility of clots.  This showed
no mass nor thrombus in the left atrium nor the right atrium.
There was evidence of mild aortic stenosis and diffuse
atheromatous aorta.  Therefore, Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] was cardioverted
and in less than one hour he reverted spontaneously to atrial
fibrillation post procedure.  To manage this, Amiodarone was
initially considered but because of concerns of liver and
pulmonary toxicity, was not pursued.  Therefore Procainamide
intravenously was used and he converted to sinus rhythm;
however when the Procainamide was transitioned to an oral
regimen, he reverted to atrial fibrillation and intravenous
Procainamide was therefore re-initiated.  Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] converted to sinus rhythm again after 12 hours.
A Procainamide level check was 16 which was elevated.  When
he was once again changed to oral Procainamide, he reverted
to atrial fibrillation.  Therefore Amiodarone was started on
[**2119-1-29**] after which he developed intermittent
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

A repeat transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2119-2-1**]
showed a thrombus in the left atrial appendage and he
converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously.

In terms of his anticoagulation, this had initially been
considered when he was in atrial fibrillation but because of
intermittent symptoms of hemoptysis, this was not pursued.
On bronchoscopy, when no endobronchial lesion was found, Mr.
[**Known lastname 7086**] was therefore heparinized.

Congestive heart failure:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] was in florid
congestive heart failure as evidenced by a JVP of 16 cm along
with scrotal and pedal edema.  His ejection fraction of less
than 10% combining with severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis and moderate aortic stenosis was likely a
contributor to his congestive heart failure.  Our choice of
therapy was limited by his blood pressure.  His ACE inhibitor
starting with Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. was poorly
tolerated because of his hypotension.  We therefore continued
him on low dose ACE inhibitor and held this with the
parameter of systolic pressure of 80.  The goal would be to
help in ventricular remodeling and to enhance forward flow.
As well, Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] was also started on Lasix 20 mg p.o.
q.d. initially and had a poor response but then diuresed well
over the ensuing days.

In the hospital, Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] complained of chest
pressure/pain intermittently.  Electrocardiograms obtained
repeatedly showed atrial fibrillation but no new EKG changes.
His CKs were cycled along with his symptoms and have remained
negative to date.

A catheterization was also considered but withheld because of
Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**]' questionable lung mass.  At the time of
dictation, it is unlikely that we will pursue catheterization
because it is unclear that this would change his prognosis.

Pulmonary:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**]' right lower lobe mass was concerning
for tumor.  A bronchoscopy was delayed until [**2119-2-2**]
because of his atrial fibrillation.  This revealed no
endobronchial lesions.  Sputum washings were obtained all of
which have been negative for malignant cells.  A
thoracentesis was also performed for a right pleural
effusion.  This procedure was difficult and required multiple
attempts under ultrasound guidance.  Eventually 150 cc of
fluid was sent and the patholog
