Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old (by record though actually 86 years-old
per brother) male with history of Afib, HTN, CVA's and severe
dememntia (nonverbal at baseline) who presented with respiratory
failure.  Per nursing home documentation the patient was short
of breath on the morning of admission AM and received
azithromycin and and furosemide at his facility.  In the evening
he looked worse and was noted to be acutesly short of breath so
he was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 18**].

There he was in some extremis with mottled skin, a heart rate in
the 180's in and hypoxia.  He was intubated almost immediately
for hypoxia and then had a central venous line placed after
becoming hypotensive.  HR improved to 80's with a single dose of
diltiazem.  He received 2L of fluid, vancomycin, levofloxacin,
and metronidazole after a CXR showed multifocal pneumonia.
Conversation with the brother and next of kln revealed he wished
the patient to be full code.  The patient was transferred to the
MICU for further treatment, vitals prior to tx were T: 101.2 P
96 rr 20 bp 109/72 sa 02 100%.

On arrival to MICU pt intubated and nonverbal at baseline so ROS
not obtainable.  Moves a small amount on own.

RADIOLOGY & OTHER STUDIES
===========================
[**10-1**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Consider left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

[**10-2**] CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
IMPRESSION-
1. Mild cardiomegaly.
2. Diffuse opacities throughout both lungs, worst in the
perihilar region and left base, concerning for multifocal
pneumonia. Effusion is also likely present on the left.
3. Multiple calcified pulmonary nodules.
4. Adequate positioning of endotracheal and nasogastric tube,
though the ETT cuff is overinflated.

[**10-2**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION-
1. Dense consolidation of the left lower lobe with associated
volume loss,
and multiple additional scattered consolidative and ground-glass
opacities
throughout the lungs bilaterally are most compatible with
multifocal
pneumonia. Massive aspiration could also have this appearance.
2. Cardiomegaly, bilateral effusions, and subtle septal
thickening suggest mild volume overload.
3. Aortic valve and coronary calcifications are noted.
4. Attenuated caliber of the central airways, without
obstruction, compatible with bronchomalacia. Mosaic attenuation
of the lung parenchyma suggests a degree of airtrapping, which
may also reflect this process.
5. Hyperinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff, with a slightly
low position of the endotracheal tube.
6. Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach, though should be
advanced for optimal positioning.
7. Distention of the gallbladder is noted in the upper abdomen.
Clinically correlate, and consider right upper quadrant
ultrasound for further evaluation if indicated.

[**10-2**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION-
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. MRI would be
more
sensitive for an acute infarction or global hypoxic injury.
2. Extensive cystic encephalomalacia in the right MCA territory,
likely
related to prior infarction.
3. Extensive cystic encephalomalacia in the left cerebellar
hemisphere and bilateral mid to inferior vermis, with partially
visualized suboccipital postsurgical changes, which could be
related to prior hemorrhage or infarct.

[**10-2**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is se
