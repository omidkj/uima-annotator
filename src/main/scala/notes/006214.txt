History of Present Illness:
84F F with PVD, CAD, s/p PCI [**2158**] with OM stenting presenting
from [**Hospital **] Hosp with chest pain that started during the stress
test. Prior to ordering the ETT, pt has been having chest pian
with increasing frequency with minimal exertion and and rest,
lasting 5-30 minutes radiating to L and right arm associated
with SOB. Due to these sx, the patient's PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] stress
test. During the stress test (unknown pharma or exercise) the
patient developed [**10-28**] CP, with ST depressions in V2-V3.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging: EKG (from OSH) shows: nml axis, normal intervals, ST
Depressions in V1, V2 and V3.
.
EKG while in the MICU (after 2u PRBC xfusion and stabilization):

NSR 60, normal axis, prolonged QTc; resolving ST dep V1, V2, V3.

.
CXR [**2161-8-2**]: There is dense opacity in the retrocardiac region
that is new
compared to the prior study that probably represents some volume

loss/effusion/infiltrate.
.
CXR [**2161-8-8**]:
A single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2161-8-8**] at 04:50
hours and compared with the prior morning's radiograph.  There
appears to be improvement in the appearance of the mild
pulmonary edema since the prior examination.  Persistent
increased retrocardiac density on the left side likely
represents superimposed airspace disease/atelectasis.  Layering
bilateral pleural effusions are a possibility.  Right-sided
subclavian line is unchanged in position.
.
Echo [**2161-8-6**]: No valvular vegetations or significant regurgitant
valve disease  seen. Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild  pulmonary hypertension. EF50%.
.
MRI [**2161-8-8**]:There is no acute stroke noted on the
diffusion-weighted imaging.  There are moderate small vessel
ischemic sequela in the subcortical and periventricular white
matter.  There is age-appropriate volume loss.
Xanthogranulomatous changes of the choroid plexus are seen
bilaterally. Mild scattered bilateral mastoid opacification is
noted.  There is mild sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening.
Evaluation of the MRA demonstrates patency of the anterior and
posterior circulations.  There is no aneurysm or stenosis within
limits of this examination.
.
CT [**2161-8-1**]:
Equivocal loss of focal differentiation in the left
frontal/parietal lobes
may signify early infarction.  The findings are subtle and
therefore, this
should be correlated with the patient's clinical symptoms as no
localizing
history was provided. If there are localizing signs, MRI with
diffusion can help.No hemorrahge or mass efffect.
.
EGD/ Colonoscopy: No source of bleeding in upper GI tract.
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Examination was limited to
proximal sigmoid colon due to acute angulation of her colon and
the severity of her diverticulosis.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to sigmoid colon



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient arrived to [**Hospital1 18**], was loaded with plavix 600/given SL
NTG/given heparin and integrillin/arrived to [**Hospital1 **] pain free.
Despite the aspirin allergy (the patient does not know what the
allergy is), the patient was given asa. The patient was also
given 80mg of Lipitor, lopressor 5mg IV x 2, and SL ntg. Per
report of nuclear medicine from [**Hospital3 **]; on the
patient's stress test, a large posterolat defect was noted at
rest, with no stress imaging performed. At [**Hospital1 18**], after transfer
onto the cath table, the patient had a loose purple malodorous
bowel movemnt, indicative of GI bleeding. Patient also
apparently vomited with some coffee ground emesis.
CAtheterization was cancelled. Due to GIBleeding, the patient
was transferred to the MICU for further care. 2u PRBCs were
transfused and the patient received IVF. Patient's inital CEs
were flat, with CK 18, Mb not done.
.
#)CAD: The patient's aspirin was initially held, but restarted
after GI bleeding stopped. Plavix was stopped. The patient was
placed on Captopril 25mg TID, Metoprolol 25mg PO BID and
Atorvastatin 40mg daily for cardioprotection, afterload
reduction and HTN control. Pt's BP on discharge was 135/52.
.
#)NSVT/ PVC's: On [**8-10**], the patient had a run of 16 beats of
assymptomatic NSVT with a potassium of 3.5. Her potassium was
repleted to 3.9 and her metoprolol was increased from 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. She had one further 3 beat run of NSVT and
occaisonal PVC's.
.
#)GI: GI evaluated while on the floor. The patient was intubated
prior to GI procedures, given fluids and blood transfusion.
Although the procedure had to be terminated somewhat early due
to mild hypoxia and bradycardia, GI got to the 2nd part of the
duodenum, saw no active bleeding, saw what they felt was an old
clot, no intervention as far as anti-coagulation. Subsequently,
they attempted a colonoscopy, but were unable to pass the
sigmoid colon due to anatomy. She remained hemodynamically
stable, HCT stable at 34 and had no further episodes of GIB. She
was placed on Pantoprozole 40mg daily.
.
#) PNA: In the MICU, the patient was found to have a  MSSA PNA
on [**8-2**] and was started on Levaquin. Initially the patient had a
leukocytosis, which trended down. The patient improved and was
afebrile, without respiratory distress on discharge.
.
#) Bacteremia: She also developed a femoral line infection with
enteroccocus, was started on Ampicillin 2g IV on [**8-5**]. A TTE
showed no evidence of endocarditis. Subsequent blood cultures
were negative. She received a PICC on [**8-10**] for a 10 day course
of Ampicillin.
.
#)Delerium: She was eventually extubated and weaned off the
ventilator; subsequently, she had altered mental status for
approx 24hrs post intubation. On the wards, the patient
alternated between lucidity and rambling, inappropriate speech,
but was always A0x3 on redirection. The patient became
increasingly appropriate over the next several days and was
presumably back to baseline on discharge.
.
#) Hypernatremia: The patient recieved a large amount of fluids
during her GI bleed. She became substantially volume overloaded
and required diuresis. The patient was diuresed with lasix with
improving lower extremity  and pulmonary edema. However, she was
slightly overdiuresed in the 3 days prior to discharge, lasix
was held and PO fluids were encouraged. Her elevated sodium was
thought to be due to
