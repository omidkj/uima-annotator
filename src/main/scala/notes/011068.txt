Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**]
Chief Complaint:
Digitalis Toxicity
Acute renal failure
diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 85 yo woman with history of CHF,
hypothyroidism, and DM2, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] for
evaluation of bradycardia. The patient currently lives in [**Location (un) 28626**] NH, where she and [**5-7**] of her co-residents reportedly
developed diarrhea over the past week. On arrival to [**Location (un) **] ED,
the patient was found to have a Dig level of 3.2, bradycardia to
the 40s, hyperkalemia to 8.0, and ARF with Cr of 2.5 (baseline
0.8). She was given Digibind, Atropine, D50, Insulin, and HCO3
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
On arrival to the ED, the patient's K was found to be decreased
to 5.5, and her ECG did not demonstrate any changes consistent
with hyperkalemia. She had a Urinalysis that was positive for
infection, so she was started on Cipro IV for a urinary tract
infection and Flagyl IV for presumed CDiff. She was also started
on IV fluids at 100 cc/h, as she has a history of CHF with EF
<35%.  Nephrology and Toxicology were consulted, and it was
determined that the patient did not have need for emergent
dialysis. She was transfered to the MICU, there the patient's VS
were P 65, R 13, 94% on 3L, BP 92/67.
.
On the floor, the patient denies any focal complaints. She
states that she does not know what brought her into the hospital
this afternoon.

ECG Study Date of [**2114-7-28**]  11:10:02 PM


Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Diffuse non-specific ST segment
flattening in the inferior and lateral leads. There are
non-specific T wave inversions in the inferior leads. There is
retarded anterior R wave progression, question normal variant,
question prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction, question
chest electrode placement. Inferior Q waves are consistent with
prior inferior myocardial infarction. Inferior T wave inversions
suggest possible ongoing inferior myocardial ischemia. There are
also inverted T waves in leads V2-V4 of uncertain significance.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

Renal Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.

RUE ultrasound: superficial phlebitis (per radiologist- report
pending)



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 85 yo woman with history of CHF,
hypothyroidism, and DM2, who presented with Acute renal failure,
digoxin toxicity, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute
diarrhea.
.
#. Digoxin Toxicity: The patient's Digoxin level at [**Location (un) **] was
3.2, and she was found to have junctional bradycardia with rate
of 40. She was given one dose of Digibind at the OSH (given
hyperkalemia and bradycardia), and her Digoxin level upon
arrival to our ED at [**Hospital1 18**] was 1.5. She was thought to have
developed dig toxicity secondary to ARF in the setting of
diarrhea and poor PO intake.  She was monitored on telemetry and
seen by the toxicology service, and she had no significant
arrhythmias.  The indication for her digoxin appears to be CHF
and it is unclear whether she still needs the medication.  She
has not seen her cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], in over 4 years.  She
should likely continue to avoid this medication in the future.
She has a follow up visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] scheduled for [**2114-8-16**].

#. Acute kidney injury: The patient's Cr on admission was 2.4,
which is increased from her baseline of 0.8 (on [**7-22**]). This was
likely pre-renal in the setting of recent diarrhea.  Renal was
consulted and agreed with this etiology.  Her creatinine
improved to 0.6 after IV fluids.

# UTI: The patient had a U/A in the ED which was consistent with
infection. She was started on Cipro for UTI.  Cultures showed
pan sensitive pseudomonas so she was kept on the ciprofloxacin.
She should continue a 7 day course to treat the urinary tract
infection and possible gastroenteritis infection (see below).

# Diarrhea: The patient and 6 other residents in her nursing
home recently developed diarrhea. C Diff was reportedly negative
at her nursing home and was negative here. Ms. [**Known lastname 10792**] was
hospitalized approximately one month ago and was C Diff positive
at that admission, so she was continued on po vanc and flagyl
empirically.  Her vancomycin was eventually stopped and she was
kept on PO flagyl. Stool studdies for cyclospora,
microsporidium, cryptosporidium, and giardia were all negative.
The etiology of the diarrhea is unclear, and could be viral or
bacterial as well as medication side effects (the pt reportedly
recently started levothyroxine and duloxetine), but since the pt
was already taking ciprofloxacin for her pseudomonas UTI it was
thought that she should have her course extended from 5 to 7
days to also treat bacterial gastroenteritis.  The patients
volume of diarrhea decreased throughout her admission.  She
initially had a flexiseal rectal tube in place, but this was
taken out.  She had two guiaic negative loose stools the day of
discharge.

# CHF: The patient has a history of systlic CHF, for which she
takes Digoxin, Metoprolol, Lisinopril, and Lasix.  These
medications were held in the setting of dig toxicity,
hypotension, volume depletion, and acute kidney injury.  She was
restarted on her metoprolol, but this medication can be switched
to the equivalent dose of long acting metoprolol XL as this
medication has been shown to be more effective in CHF patients
than the short acting.  Her lisinopril was also restarted after
her kidney function improved. Her lasix can be restarted as an
outpatient, but her volume status should be followed carefully
if she develops recurrent diarrhea or other volume losses.

# Pacemaker: It was also noted that the patient had a pacemaker
but that the
