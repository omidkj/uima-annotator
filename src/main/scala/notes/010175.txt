Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Trazodone / Risperdal / Indocin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Chronic back pain. Presenting for laminectomy.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Fusion laminectomy of L4-L5 and lumar laminectomy of L5-S1 on
[**12-26**]

2. Intubation [**12-30**]


History of Present Illness:
59 y/o female with PMH sinificant for interstitial lung disease
secondary to asbestosis; COPD; type 2 diabetes mellitus; and
chronic back pain secondary to claudication who was admitted to
the surgery service on [**12-26**] for a laminectomy who is now
transferred to the medicine service for CHF management. The pt
was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service on [**12-26**] at which
time she underwent a fusion laminectiomy of L4-L5 and a lumbar
laminectomy of L5-S1. Pt initially did fairly well postop
although she was tachycardic which was attributed to pain.
However, on [**12-29**], she began to require higher FIO2 for adequate
oxygenation. At that time, she was transferred to the SICU for
closet monitoring. A medicine consult was obtained. It was
recommended that the pt be agressively diuresed as she was very
volume overload and the 6 units of PRBC the pt had received
following the operation. The pt was started on a beta blocker
for rate control which was successful but contributed to
bronchospasm so she was started on nebs at that time. On post op
day 5, the psychiatry was consulted as the pt had developed a
delerium. On [**12-30**], the pt required intubation for respiratory
distress and hypotension into the 70s systolic. The pt also
devloped SVT which was AVnRT vs AT. Pt continued to be diuresed
and was extubated on [**1-4**]. She remained mildly confused at that
time but her delerium was improved. Pt's respiratory status has
improved at this time and she will be transferred to medicine
for further treatment of her CHF.

At the time of transfer, pt denied any pain. She felt that her
breathing was "fine" but not quite as good as it is at baseline.
Was eating dinner and reported that she was very hungery. No
other concerns.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2177-12-26**]):
FINDINGS:
An endotracheal tube terminates at the thoracic inlet. The heart
is enlarged but unchanged in size. There is failure that appears
unchanged. Pulmonary parenchymal opacity is seen within the left
lower lobe with associated small bilateral pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:
Cardiomegaly with failure and left lower lobe atelectasis. Small
bilateral pleural effusions.

Echo ([**2178-1-7**]):
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. LV
inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated
pulmonary artery  systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2176-12-13**],
there is no
significant change (left ventricular hypertrophy present in
prior study but not noted in prior report).







Brief Hospital Course:
58 y/o female wtih PMH significant for obstructive and
restrictive lung disease; type 2 DM; and bipolar disorder s/p
fusion laminectiomy of L4-L5 and a lumbar laminectomy of L5-S1
on [**12-26**] transferred to the medicine service on [**1-6**] for
further management of her CHF. Doing well at this time and is
ready for discharge.

1. Cardiac:
[**Name (NI) 26573**] Pt experienced respiratory distress requiring intubation
after receiving a large amount of IV fluids and blood products
following surgery. As noted above, she experienced an episode of
resipiratory distress in the SICU resulting in the need for
reintubation. Following this, the pt was agressively diuresed
and was able to be extubated on [**1-4**]. On transfer to the
medicine service, the pt continued to have mild crackles on exam
and mildly elevated neck veins so she continued to be diuresed.
The pt had good output over the next few days and her pulmonary
exam cleared. In addition, she had an oxygen saturation in the
mid to high 90s on 3 L NC which is her baseline home oxygen
requirement. By the time of discharge, pt was euvolemic. She was
restarted on her home dose of lasix of 40 mg PO BID. Pt had echo
on [**1-7**] to further evaluate her cardiac function which was
basically unchanged from a study in 01/[**2176**]. It showed a LVEF of
>65% and no real valvular disease. It is consistent with
diastolic dysfunction. Pt was continued on beta blocker with
good effect. Daily weights were obtainded. Strict ins and outs
were followed.

Ischemia/[**Name (NI) 109702**] Pt had no significant valvular disease on her
echo from [**1-7**]. No evidence for ischemia during admission. Of
note, she was ruled out for a MI in the SICU.

[**Name (NI) 9520**] Pt had an episode of SVT in the SICU on [**12-
