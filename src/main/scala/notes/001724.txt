Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5037**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, shortness of breath
.
Reason for MICU transfer: Dyspnea, Respiratory Distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2181-8-23**] - Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
This is a pleasant 60-year old Indian female with a complicated
past medical history significant for type 1 IDDM (s/p revision
renal and pancraes transplants, [**2160**] and [**2174**]), diastolic CHF
(Echo 35-40%, [**7-/2181**]), sleep-disordered breathing (on 2L home
oxygen at night) who presented on [**2181-8-17**] with dyspnea and
evidence of bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Of note, the patient was most recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 17771**]) with
complaints of weakness and dyspnea. She was found to be
inurosepsis and was treated empirically with Meropenem and
Vancomycin (she has a history of prior urosepsis in [**6-/2180**],
speciating MDR E.coli). She was again found to have E.coli in
her urine as a source, and was treated with Meropenem IV and
switched to Ertapenem on discharge. She also had an NSTEMI with
positive tropoinin of 0.36 on admission (MB 10.6) which peaked
at 1.11 on HD#3, thought to be related to demand ischemia. Her
prior EKG had evidence of LBBB. ETT was obtained, showing a
likely distal LAD lesion, not cardiomyopathy, distal septal
akinesis, 3+ MR which may have been associated with volume. She
was aggressively diuresed with a Lasix gtt given her acute CHF
exacerbation and transitioned to Lasix 60 mg IV BID, likely
triggered by urosepsis. She was also treated with empirically
for C.diff with PO Vancomycin to end on [**2181-8-21**].
.
In the ED, VS BP 102-125 systolic, MAPs mid 50-60s, HR 63, RR
27, 98% 2L; the patient was hypoxic to the 90s on 2L. Bedside
ultrasound showed bilateral pleural effusions. IP was consulted
for possible thoracentesis, and diuresis was recommended. She
was given 60 mg IV Lasix. Her troponin was 0.38. BNP 24,918.
Levofloxacin 750 mg IV and Vancomycin 1g IV x 1 were given;
Lactate 0.6. She has a RUE PICC line.
.
She was admitted to MICU due to low MAPs to the 50s-60s in the
ED and oxygen saturations in the low 90s on 2 liters. In the
MICU, she was started on a Lasix gtt and metolazone was added.
She is LOS: -3.2 Liters. VS prior to transfer: 95.6 141/67 91 14
98% on 2L NC. Notably had visual hallucinations and started on
seroquel.
.
On the floor, she appears fatigued, but is in no acute distress.
She denies chest pain or trouble breathing. She denies
palpitations, lightheadedness, and feels only mildly dizzy when
standing. She denies headaches or vision changes. She has no
nausea or vomiting and has been tolerating diet.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea.
She does have some edema in her right leg; but she denies
palpitations, syncope.

.
EKG ([**2181-8-17**]): Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. A-V
conduction delay. Left bundle-branch block. No significant
change compared to the tracing of [**2181-8-1**].
.
2D-ECHOCARDGIOGRAM ([**2181-8-1**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the apex and hypokinesis of the distal segments of
the LV. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40
%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation
jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial
physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
