   HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final [**2108-5-14**]):
      NEGATIVE BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
.
Imaging:
CXR:
FINDINGS: An NG tube is noted coiled in the gastric cavity, its
tip is excluded. The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits.
The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The lungs
are clear. No evidence of pleural effusions. No evidence of
pneumothorax. The osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. NG
tube is noted coiled in the gastric cavity, its tip is excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o M hx type 2 DM, CKD, prostate ca s/p prostatectomy
admitted with hematemesis.  His hospital course is as follows:
.
Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Acute Gastritis: Hematemesis:
Patient was found to have a Hct of 25 in the ED (baseline 30).
NG lavage demonstrated 100ml of blood.  The patient was
otherwise stable.  GI was consulted and EGD was performed in the
ED, demonstrating gastritis.  He was given 2 units of PRBCs and
transferred to the MICU for overnight observation.  His Hct
remained stable at 28 thereafter.  He was put on a PPI [**Hospital1 **].  His
anti-hypertensives and diuretics were initially held.  However,
as he was stable we added back his clonidine and a lower dose of
his beta blocker.  We discharged him on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI, clonidine,
and a lower dose BB.  He will need a follow up colonoscopy and
have his H. pylori serologies followed up.  His
anti-hypertensives and diuretics can likely be re-started as an
outpatient.
.
Tachycardia: Sinus rhthym.  Was thought likely ssecondary to the
fact he had been off his BB for his GI bleed.  His beta blocker
was re-started at a lower dose, to be up-titrated as an
outpatient.  He was also given gentle IVF to maintain his
volume.
.
Benign Hypertension:  Held all anti-hypertensives.  Re-started
his clonidine and BB at a lower dose prior to D/C.
.
Type 2 DM uncontrolled: Continued his home regimen and ISS while
in house.
.
CKD: Baseline creatinine 2.5 and stable during this admission.
.

You were diagnosed with an upper gastrointestinal bleed due to
gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach.  This was likely
caused by ibuprofen.  You were given a blood transfusion and
your hematocrit stabilized, as did your blood pressure.  You
were also started on an acid blocker called protonix.  Please
resume all of your previous medications as before, EXCEPT for
your blood pressure medications (diovan, lasix, metolazone,
isosorbide dinitrate).  We have decreased your metoprolol
(lopressor) to 12.5 mg twice daily until you see your doctor.
DO NOT take anymore ibuprofen, advil, motrin, alleve, or other
NSAIDS.
.
Please follow up with your primary care physician regarding
restarting all of your blood pressure medications and your water
pill.  You will be given a new medication called protonix to be
taken twice daily for 2 weeks.
.
You will also need to schedule a colonoscopy through your
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need to follow up H. pylori

additional bleeding, cehst pain, dizziness/lightheadedness, or
any other symptoms that concern you.
