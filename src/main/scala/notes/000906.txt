Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7881**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with known 3v CAD and multiple prior stents who has
previously refused CABG, SSS s/p PPM, and myelodysplasia who
transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] with chest pain.

He has known 3 vessel CAD with a tight LAD lesion found in [**5-31**]
for which stent placement was not thought possible and he
decline CABG. Since then he has had stable angina responsive to
SL NTG that he gets a few times per week.  He typically gets
chest pain with exertion or if HCt drops which is frequent due
to MDS.  This morning he had chest pain and pressure which was
relieved with SL NTG but recurred approximately 30 minutes
after.  He ended up taking 4 SL NTG before presenting to
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**].  He reports that the character of his chest pain
is similar to his prior episodes of angina.  He has a history of
NSTEMIs and angina in the setting of anemia.  He missed his
epogen dose last week, received a dose yesterday.  Per his son,
his baseline Hgb is 13.4 and had dropped to 11.4 upon
presentation to [**Location (un) 620**].

He denies any cough, PND, orthopnea.  He does endorse peripheral
edema over the past 1 month for which he has been wearing
compression stockings.

At [**Location (un) 620**], his vitals were 66 149/70 18 97% on RA, 94% on RA.
He became chest pain free with a nitro gtt and Lasix.  His
troponin was 0.22 which is his baseline.  His CXR showed
pulmonary edema.  He also recieved aspirin and Plavix.  [**Location (un) 620**]
though he had a CHF exacerbation due to crackles on exam.  He
was sent here for admission to cardiology and optimization of
his medications. In our ED, basic labs were sent and ECG looked
unchanged from prior (V-paced with TWI in V1-2).  He continued
on a nitro gtt.  On transfer to the floor, vitals were 98.5 65
153/66 14 100.

He also has new onset of hematuria today.  He does not have a
history of recent foley placement.  He has a h/o microscopic
hematuria in the past.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Studies:
ECG [**2198-10-2**]: Atrial sensed ventricular paced rhythm rate, 77.
There is no other diagnostic interim change.

Chest Xray [**2198-10-2**]: New interval haziness/blunting at the left
costophrenic angle, which could be due to left small pleural
effusion and adjacent small atelectasis at the left lung base;
however, cannot rule out pneumonia.

TTE [**2198-10-3**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
mid inferolateral and anterolateral walls, and distal anterior,
inferior and apical segments. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction suggestive of multivessel CAD. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

Chest Xray [**2198-10-4**]: There is interval development of bilateral
perihilar, right more than left, interstitial linear opacities
continuing toward the lung bases, including the bilateral
subpleural linear opacities as seen in particular in the right
lower lobe, findings that are consistent with interval
development of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. Cardiomegaly is
moderate and unchanged. There is no interval development of
mediastinal widening. There is no appreciable increase in
pleural effusion, although small amount of right pleural fluid
is most likely present.

Renal Ultrasound [**2198-10-5**]:
1. Normal-sized kidneys without signs of hydronephrosis. Small
nonobstructive right renal stone is noted.
2. Mucosal-based soft tissue nodule in the right posterolateral
bladder wall suggestive of urothelial neoplasm. Further
evaluation with cystoscopy or MRI would be indicated, when
clinical conditions warrant.
3. Enlarged prostate.

Cardiac cath report: Pending at the time of discharge. Patient
had intervention 2 drug eluting stents placed to proximal LAD
using tandem heart intra-procedure.

ECHO [**2198-10-15**]:
