HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
gentleman with history of diabetes, coronary artery disease,
status post MI and CABG, chronic renal insufficiency, and
peripheral vascular disease with a necrotic right great toe,
who now presents complaining of abdominal discomfort.  The
patient is a poor historian, but describes waking on the
morning of admission with epigastric pain that was non-
radiating accompanied with nausea and vomiting x2, which did
not relieve his symptoms.  He went to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital for
scheduled appointment for foot evaluation and received pain
medicine, but reports that made him sicker.  He then went
home and called his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] advised him to go to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.  Here at
[**Hospital1 18**], he was found to be febrile with an increased lactate
and white blood cell count qualifying for the MUST protocol,
but the patient refused a central line.  He received Unasyn 3
g IV and ceftriaxone 1 g IV in the ER.  Plain films of his
foot revealed no gas.  Ultimately, the patient did agree to a
central line, which was placed in the ED, and was also given
vancomycin for broader gram-positive coverage.  A chest x-ray
showed good line placement, cardiomegaly, and possible left
retrocardiac opacities.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound done
in the ED showed a question of acalculous cholecystitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His physical exam on admission
demonstrated temperature of 101.2 degrees.  His blood
pressure was 187/76.  His heart rate was 89.  Respirations
were 24.  Oxygen saturation was 98 percent on room air.  In
general, he was somnolent, frequently falling asleep, in no
obvious discomfort.  His HEENT revealed anicteric sclerae.
His pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  His
neck did show some jugular venous distension.
Cardiovascular:  He had a normal S1, S2, with a regular
rhythm.  He had a grade 3/4 systolic murmur at the apex.  His
respiratory/chest exam revealed bibasilar rales.  His abdomen
exam demonstrated a soft abdomen with mild right upper
quadrant tenderness.  Bowel sounds were present.  His
extremities showed no edema and right lower extremity
erythema.

LABORATORY DATA:  His white count was 20.7 with 95 percent
neutrophils, 2 percent lymphocytes, and 2 percent monocytes.
His hematocrit was 35.1.  His platelets were 186.  His INR
was 2.1.  His PTT was 31.8.  His sodium was 128.  His
potassium was 4.5.  His chloride was 82.  His bicarbonate was
17.  BUN of 65, creatinine of 8.9, glucose of 391.  His CK
was 468.  His MB was 8.  His troponin was 0.8.  His lactate
was 7.0 on admission.  His ALT was 1050.  His AST was 1674.
His alkaline phosphatase was 399.  His amylase was 17.  His
total bilirubin was 1.0.  His globulin was 3.7.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  EKG showed sinus rhythm at 88 beats
per minute with a normal axis and an incomplete left bundle-
branch block.  He had downsloping ST segments with T-wave
inversions in I, aVL, V5, and V6.  There were no prior EKGs
for comparison.  His right upper quadrant ultrasound showed a
gallbladder wall with edema without stones or sludge.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 60-year-old gentleman with history of
diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery
disease, and end-stage renal disease, now presenting after
leaving an outside hospital with a necrotic right foot, now
presenting with lactic acidosis, elevated LFTs, and elevated
troponin.

In terms of his ID issues, the patient was thought to have
multiple sources of infection including his right foot,
possible C. difficile colitis given recent antibiotic use,
possible cholecystitis, possibly a pneumonia.  He was
continued on the vancomycin, Unasyn, and ceftriaxone.
Cultures of his sputum and blood were taken.  He subsequently
had multiple C. difficile colitis samples that came back
negative.  His hepatitis panel that was drawn came back
negative except for a hepatitis B surface antibody, which was
consistent with immunization.  He had a CTA of the lungs done
that showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus, but did show
diffuse ground-glass opacities.  Over the course of the next
couple of days, the patient's white count continued to trend
down and he remained afebrile.  The Zosyn was continued;
however, the ceftriaxone and vancomycin were discontinued
secondary to no indication for their continued use, i.e., no
cultures that came back positive for Zosyn resistant
organisms requiring those antibiotics.  Ultimately, the
source of infection was thought to be related to his
pneumonia rather than his wounds on his right foot.  He was
continued on the Zosyn as an outpatient with good nosocomial
Pseudomonas coverage as well as coverage for atypicals and
community-acquired organisms.

In terms of the patient's question of acalculous
cholecystitis, a General Surgery consult was obtained that
felt the patient did not have any surgical issues.  Vascular
Surgery was consulted regarding the patient's necrotic right
great toe, and they felt that the patient did need re-
vascularization of that extremity; however, they did not want
to perform the operation until his respiratory status was
optimized and felt that the operation could be done safely as
an outpatient.

In terms of the patient's gastrointestinal status, his LFTs
continued to trend down over the course of his admission.  On
discharge, his AST was 33, his ALT was 292, his alkaline
phosphatase was 185, and his total bilirubin was 1.0.  The
ultimate source of his elevated LFTs on admission was thought
to be related to ischemia consistent with the elevated
lactate on admission.

In terms of his hypertension, the patient was placed on
captopril and it was titrated up to maximal blood pressure
benefit.

In terms of the patient's diabetes, he was placed on an
insulin sliding scale and did well with that.

In terms of the patient's renal status, he was continued on
his outpatient regimen of hemodialysis without incident.

The patient was discharged to home on hospital day 9 in
stable condition.

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:  The patient was to follow up with his
primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 3-5 days.  The patient will
also need to follow up with Vascular Surgery, Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **].
