Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache, aphasia and right hemiparesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG tube insertion

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87210**] is a 54 year-old right-handed man with no known
significant past medical history who initially presented to
[**Hospital3 **] with severe headache and subsequent "aphasia"
and right hemiparesis who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when he
was found to have left basal ganglia hemorrhage.

According to the patient's son and nephew, the patient was
feeling well on [**2195-8-9**].  In fact, he went outside to do some
yard work.  While performing the yard work, he suddenly
developed
a severe headache that seemed to involve his entire head.  He
started stumbling around, and his wife helped him to sit down.
He seemed to develop difficulty speaking and right-sided
weakness.  Accordingly, she called 911.  He was initially
transported to [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital1 107**], where he was found to
have a blood pressure of 190/90.  Initial examinations describe
a
leftward gaze deviation and flaccidity of the right limbs.  A
non-contrast CT of the head revealed a left basal ganglia
hemorrhage.  He was intubated and given a dilantin load as
seizure prophylaxis prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and care.
.
At the time of his arrival, a non-contrast CT of the head was
repeated and demonstrated relative stability of the lesion.
Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and indicated no acute
neurosurgical intervention was warranted.  Accordingly,
neurology
was asked to participate in the patient's care.

internally rotates and extends into stimulus)

CT Head [**8-10**]
FINDINGS: There is a large focus of parenchymal hemorrhage seen
in the basal ganglia on the left measuring 4.8 x 2.3 cm,
minimally increased from previous measurements of 4.3 x 1.9 cm.
This area of acute hemorrhage is surrounded by a thin rim of
hypodensity reflecting parenchymal edema. There is no new focus
of hemorrhage. There is consequent mild effacement of the left
lateral ventricle and no significant shift of midline
structures. The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal in
size and configuration. Note is made of striking periventricular
white matter hypodensity reflecting severe chronic microvascular
infarction. There is no fracture.

CT Head [**8-12**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Possible marginal increase in the size of the left lentiform
hematoma,
along with marginal increase in the effacement of the lateral
ventricle and shift of the midline structures to the right side
as described above.
Possibility of superimposed/containing hemorrhage cannot be
completely
excluded. While the basal ganglial hemorrhage can be seen with
systemic
hypertension, do correlate clinically to evaluate for any
underlying vascular or mass lesions as a cause.
2. Prominent tip of the Basilar artery, with a focal prominence
in the left side of the interpeduncular cistern, which may
relate to the termination of the Basilar artery/aneurysm in
proximity to the posterior cerebral artery.

ECHO [**8-12**]
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved regional and hyperdynamic biventricular systolic
function c/w high-output state. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. No definite structural cardiac source of embolism
identified.

Renal U/S with Doppler [**8-17**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of renal artery stenosis. No
hydronephrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
General: Mr. [**Known lastname 87210**] initially presented with headache, aphasia,
right neglect, and right hemiparesis.  Over the course of his
hospitilization he recovered partial function of the right side,
but failed multiple swallow evaluations.

Neuro: Mr. [**Known lastname 87210**] initially had dense right hemiplegia, which
improved significantly by discharge.  He demonstrated neglect of
the right side, by discharge he responded to questions arising
from the right.  He had significant weakness ofthe right lower
extremities, both toes were downgoing by discharge.  He has
significant dysarthria.

Cardiac:  Mr. [**Known lastname 87210**] initially presented with significant
hypertension, and throughout his hospital stay he remained
difficult to control.  He was started on Verapamil, Lisinopril,
and Labetalol.  He had elevated creatinine on lisinopril and it
was discontinued, with potential to be restarted at a later
time.

Respiratory: Mr. [**Known lastname 87210**] was initially intubated, for level of
consciousness and secretions, and was extubated successfully
after several days.  He had several chest xrays (most recent on
[**2195-8-20**]) which appeared to have atelectasis of the right lower
lobe, but no focal consolidations.

Renal: Mr. [**Known lastname 87211**] creatinine was initially elevated.  Due to
his difficult to treat hypertension and lack of medical care
previously, secondary causes of hypertension were investigated.
Urine Pr:cr was 0.2, and renal doppler u/s was normal.

FEN/GI: Pt failed multiple swallow evaluations and a PEG tube
was placed on [**2195-8-20**] by Gastroenterology.  On [**8-24*
