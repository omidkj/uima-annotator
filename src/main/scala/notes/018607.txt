[**2192-10-23**] CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST
1. 9 x 11 right upper lobe nodule is adjacent to the tracheal
wall with no residual fat plane on one image, worrisome for
primary lung cancer, should be further evaluated with PET CT.
Scattered borderline lymph nodes up to 8 mm in the right upper
paratracheal region.
2. Mild emphysema. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening.
3. Focal areas of fibrosis and bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Severely atherosclerotic aorta with aneurysmal dilatation of
the descending aorta. Rim-like calcification of the aorta with
asymmetric thrombus of the descending thoracic aorta.
5. Coronary artery calcifications.
6. Fluid-density lesion in the right cardiophrenic angle, could
be a pericardial cyst, could also be further evaluated by PET
CT.
[**2192-10-23**] CAROTID SERIES
Moderate plaque with a left 60-69% carotid stenosis. On the
right, there is a less than 40% stenosis.
1. Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed
severe native three vessel coronary disease. The LMCA had no
obstructive coronary disease. The LAD was totally occluded
proximally. The LCX had a 95% mid vessel stenosis. OM1 had an
ostial 60% and 90% mid stenosis. The LPDA was non-obstructed.
The RCA had severe diffuse disease up to 80% in the mid-portion
with collaterals to the LAD. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics
revealed normal systemic arterial pressure with an SBP of 133 mm
Hg.


Brief Hospital Course:
From the ED, the patient went to cardiac catheterization which
showed severe 3vCAD - LMCA had no obstructive; LAD was totally
occluded proximally; LCX had a 95% mid vessel stenosis; OM1 had
an ostial 60% and 90% mid stenosis; LPDA was non-obstructed; RCA
had severe diffuse disease up to 80% in the mid-portion with
collaterals to the LAD. No stenting was done. Cardiac surgery
was consulted to evaluate for CABG.  CT chest, carotid
ultrasound, PFTs and urinalysis were performed to assess the
candidate's status for surgery.  CT chest revealed a 1cm nodule,
noted previously at the OSH.  Thoracic surgery and pulmonology
evaluated the nodule and felt it could be worked up as an
outpatient. She was brought to the operating room on [**10-25**] where
she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3. Please see
operative report for surgical details. In summary she had an off
pump CABGx3 with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-PDA. . She tolerated the
operation well and following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive hemodynamic monitoring in stable condition.
She remained hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op
period, her anesthesia was reversed she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
She was transferred to the step down unit on POD 1.  Chest tubes
and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  On POD
3 the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation to the 140s.
She was given a loading dose of oral amiodarone, 600mg, and
electrolytes were repleted. Beta blocker was titrated as
tolerated and the patient did convert to sinus rhythm.
The remainder of her hospital course was uneventful and on POD5
she was discharged to rehabilitation at Lifecare [**Location (un) 5165**].
