INTERPRETATION:
Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Mild regional
LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid inferior -
hypo; inferior apex - hypo;
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.
Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter.
Simple atheroma
in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple
atheroma in
descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. Mild
mitral
annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No
MS.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PR.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction
of the inferior wall. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly  depressed.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6. The
mitral valve appears  structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is on an infusion of phenylephrine and the
patient is being A  paced
1. Biventricuolar systolic function is preserved. Inferior wall
hypokinesis is  still seen, marginally improved
2. Aorta appears is intact post decannulation
3. Other findings are unchanged
4. Findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was referred for outpatient cath after experienceing
several weeks of exertional angina and having positive stress
test. Please see cath report for details, in summary cardiac
catheterization showed LMain 80%, LAD 80%, LCX 90%, RCA 100%
w/L->R collaterals.
Pt then referred to CT surgery for evaluation CABG.
On [**1-6**] Mr [**Known lastname **] was brought to operating room for CABG, please
see oR report for details, in summary had
CABGx4(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM,SVG-Diag,SVG-PDA). He tolerated the
operation well and was transferred from the OR to Cardiac
surgery ICU. He did well in the immediate post-op period, his
anesthesia was reversed and he was extubated. On POD1 his chest
tubes were removed and he was transferred to the floors for
continued post-op care. On POD2 his epicardial wires were
removed. Over the next several days his activity level was
advanced, his betablockers and diuretics were adjusted and on
POD4 it was decided he was stable and ready for discharge home
w/visiting nurses.
