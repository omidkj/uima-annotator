CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Gangrene and nonhealing ulceration of the
left fourth toe times three weeks.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4281**] is a 66-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus for the last twelve years along
with coronary artery disease, who presented with a nonhealing
ulceration and gangrene of his left fourth toe, which started
three weeks ago as a small pressure ulceration.  The patient
deferred medical treatment until his wife took him to a
doctor one week prior to admission and he was directly
admitted for IV antibiotics.  The patient also admitted to
rest pain of the foot, which was relieved with narcotics and
had been occurring in the same time frame.  He denied any
previous history of claudications, fevers, chills, labile
blood sugars, nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath.  He
was admitted for angiogram and pre-anginal hydration with
renal protection as he had a mild chronic renal insufficiency
with the serum creatinine of 1.5.  MRA done at an outside
hospital revealed a normal aortoiliac system, superficial
femoral artery, and popliteal artery with runoff.  The
anterior tibial artery, which lead into a diseased dorsalis
pedis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Positive for noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus for
the last twelve years.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in
[**2126**] status post coronary artery bypass graft at that time.
4.  Positive nicotine abuse of over 120 pack per year, but
stopped ten years ago.
5.  The patient has a history of anemia of unknown origin,
most likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency with
serum creatinine noted to be 1.5.
6.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
8.  Neuropathy and arthritis of his left hand.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  History is significant for Coronary artery bypass
grafting with the use of right greater saphenous vein in
[**2126**], as well as transurethral resection of the prostate.
2.  Appendectomy.
3.  Umbilical hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Levaquin 500 mg PO q.d.
2.  Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.
4.  Digoxin 0.25 mg PO q.d.
5.  Diltiazem 240 mg PO q.d.
6.  Glipizide 10 mg PO b.i.d.
7.  Trental 400 mg PO t.i.d.
8.  Lasix 20 mg PO q.d.
9.  Protonix 40 mg PO q.d.
10. Glucophage 750 mg PO q.a.m. and 500 mg q.p.m.
11. Tylenol #3.
12. Regular insulin sliding scale.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**], where he was transferred from an
outside institution.  He was initially started on oral
Levaquin and Flagyl for his toe ulceration.  Angiogram was
scheduled for the day after admission and he was subsequently
hydrated gently overnight.  He was given the Mucomyst
protocol.  The Glucophage and Lasix were held prior to
angiogram.  The creatinine was 1.6.  The hematocrit at that
time was noted to be 25.

On hospital day #1, noninvasive studies were also obtained.
These revealed a limited study due to the examination being
technically difficult as the patient declined having the cups
placed for the volume recordings at any location other than
the ankles.  EBIs were noted to be inaccurate due to
extensive vessel compressibility.  The angiogram revealed no
significant proximal inflow disease from the level of the
renal arteries to the knee.  The anterior tibial artery was
the only continuously patent leg vessel and it was severely
stenosed in its first and few centimeters.  A patent dorsalis
pedis artery was noted.  No plantar arteries were opacified.
Based on this information the patient was taken to the
operating room on [**2-2**], where a left superficial
femoral to dorsalis pedis artery bypass was performed with
the use of nonreverse saphenous vein graft.  At that time a
left fourth toe open amputation was also performed.  Details
of this procedure are dictated in a separate operative note.
The patient did fairly well hemodynamically, postoperatively
and was transferred up to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit.
PA catheter was placed, which revealed significant pulmonary
hypertension.  This was noted on preoperative echocardiogram.
These were obtained from the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Medical
records.  A Cardiolite imaging study revealed a large fixed
hypoperfusion defect involving the inferior apical and
inferolateral regions.  It was suggestive of an area of prior
myocardial infarction with no significant residual ischemia.
On gated images the left ventricle was moderately enlarged
with moderately reduced systolic function due to wall-motion
abnormalities.  The right ventricle was also noted to be
enlarged.  The pulmonary was noted to be approximately
56  mmHg and a left ventricular ejection fraction was noted
to be approximately 30%.

On postoperative day #2, the patient's pulmonary artery
catheter was pulled out to monitor CVP.  He was able to get
out of bed to a chair and he was started on a regular diet.
He did have some nausea, which was relieved with Reglan and
Compazine.

Consultation was sought by his medical internist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3845**]
at that time.

On postoperative day #3, the CVP line was changed over to
central-venous catheter.  He was transferred to the floor and
he started to ambulate with physical therapy.  After that
time, he did extremely well and progressed very rapidly.  His
wound was left open, however, it did continue to show
evidence of healing with pink granulation tissue.  He had a
palpable dorsalis pedis graft pulse.  He was seen by the
Department of Physical Therapy routinely throughout the
hospital stay and he was eventually cleared for discharge
home.  He was sent home with a walker and he was only going
to need VNA care for his left fourth toe amputation site.

On postoperative day #4, he did have some nausea, while on
the floor.  However, an EKG was obtained and revealed no
significant changes from previous EKGs.  On postoperative day
#5, the patient was discharged to home on PO Keflex.  It was
to be continued for approximately ten days.  The patient was
instructed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] to followup in his office in ten
days to two weeks.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination at the time of discharge
revealed a well-developed, well-nourished male appearing
slightly older than his stated age of 66.  NECK:  Neck was
supple without evidence of JVD or carotid bruits.  HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm.  LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended without evidence of masses or bruits.
EXTREMITIES:  Revealed 1+ edema on the left lower extremity.
He had a palpable dorsalis pedis graft pulse.  The wound was
clean, dry, and intact and granulating well at that time.
Wet-to-dry dressings were initiated for the wound to be
changed twice daily.  An ACE wrap was to be applied from the
toes to the knee while the patient was ambulatory.  He was
able to full weightbearing with a healing sandle.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 20 mg PO q.d.
2.  Keflex 500 mg PO q.i.d. times ten days.
3.  Albuterol metered dose inhaler two puffs q.i.d.
4.  Reglan 10 mg PO q.i.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg PO q.d.
6.  Trental 400 mg PO t.i.d. with food.
7.  Lopressor 500 mg PO b.i.d.
8.  Aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.
9.  Digoxin 0.25 mg PO q.d.
10. Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d.
11. Diltiazem 240 mg PO q.d.
12. Glipizide 10 mg PO b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Gangrene and nonhealing ulceration of the left fourth toe
secondary to tibial peroneal disease.
2.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction.
