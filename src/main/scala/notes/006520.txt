Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the right atrium. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). No
definite echodensities are seen inside the left ventricular
chamber. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The examined ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque and mobile echodensities. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on [**2189-6-18**] at 1645.
