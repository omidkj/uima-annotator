Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and wide complex tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP study
internal cardiac defibrillator placed


History of Present Illness:
51M with CAD s/p PCIX2 to the LCx ([**2117**],[**2121**]), systolic CHF
(EF=40% in [**2121**]) and T2DM, COPD on home O2, who was transfered
from OSH after multiple shocks for wide-complex tachycardia.
.
Patient was noted to have the onset of chest pain the night
prior to admission, he subsequently called 911, EMS found him in
resp distress, diaphoretic, WCT on monitor @ 180??????s, Shocked
biphasic sync 70 and 100 without effect and was brought to
[**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital.  At [**Location (un) **] ED he received Amio 150mg
IV x 2 , Shocked biphasic sync 100, 100, 150, 200, Calc
chloride, Insulin, bicarb
Adenosine 6 & 12. None of these interventions terminated his WCT
and he was then given a metoprolol IV with reported improvement
in his heart rate to the 100s. Of note, he has a known LBBB
documented at prior admission to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2121**]. Never lost
peripheral pulses, remained responsive to voice throughout.
Patient had also recieved Aspirin PR. At OSH noted to be hypoxic
to the 80s and CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema. Nasal
intubation was attempted X2 but patient did not tolerate, then
intubated with etumidate,  reportedly had copious secretions on
intubation. Bedside echo ?????? dilated LV,minimal septal/lateral
contractility, hypok at apex.  No pericardial effusion.  BP's
subsequently labile at 80's-100's.
 A right groin line was attempted which was found to be in the
femoral artery and was subsequently removed, he reportedly
received a dose of Unasyn for this + suspected aspiration.
.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was intubated/vented on
fent/versed, CMV FiO2: 100% PEEP: 18 RR: 24 Vt:470, initial
vitals were 129 97/70 81%.
- CXR showed diffuse bil alveolar infiltrates consistent with
florid pulmonary edema.
- Chem 7, CBC showed WBC 19.0, hyperglycemia to 433 but was
otherwise unremarkable. WBC = 19.0
- ECG (my read) shows regular tachycardia 110 with leftish axis
WNL and LBBB morphology which is consistent with his prior
baseline and without precordial concordence. Rythm looks like
sinus tachycardia, as P waves identified consistent with prior
tracing with PR = 0.16.
- given 10units of IV insulin

CXR [**2124-10-17**]: 1.  Severe diffuse bilateral airspace opacities
might represent pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage or
widespread infection. Further assessment with chest CT is
recommended.
2.  Endotracheal tube ending 4.8 cm above the carina

ECHO [**2124-10-17**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to akinesis of the
entire posterior wall, and hypokinesis (with regional variation)
of the rest of the left ventricle - basal segments relatively
well-preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free
wall contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2124-10-18**]:
IMPRESSION:  Almost complete resolution of bilateral diffuse
airspace
opacifications consistent with diagnosis of pulmonary edema.

Cardiac MRI [**2124-10-20**]:
Mildly enlarged left atrium and normal size right atrium.
Increased left
ventricular cavity. Thinned and akinetic antero-basal and
mid-basal antero-lateral walls.  Moderately hypokinesis of the
other ventricular segments with probable dyssynchrony also
present. Transmural late gadolinium enhancement of the
antero-basal and mid-basal antero-lateral wall, consistent with
fibrosis or scar, and low likelihood of contractile recovery
after revascularization. No evidence of late gadolinium
enhancement in the other, hypokinetic, left ventricular
segments.  Normal right ventricular cavity size and function.
The ascending aorta, descending aorta and main pulmonary artery
were normal. No significant aortic or mitral
