CTA:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
2. Stable cylindrical bronchiectasis and distal bronchiolectasis
with some
bronchial wall thickening and inspissated secretions. The degree
of
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities diffusely throughout the lung has slightly
increased in the interval, which may suggest superimposed
infection/inflammation.
Additional new ground-glass opacities noted within the left
lower lobe, whichis nonspecific, may also reflect infection or
sequelae from recent
bronchoscopies/lavage.

Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. There are focal calcifications in
the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84305**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] his rigid bronchoscopy and Y stent
removal on [**2117-2-17**] and was transferred to the PACU, where he had
some respiratory distress and failed to maintain his O2
saturations on supplemental 02. He was started on CPAP which
resulted in good 02 saturations. He was then transferred to the
SICU for close observation due to his CPAP/BiPAP requirement.

On post procedure day 1, he did well and was on supplemental O2
during the day and CPAP overnight. He was eating a regular diet
and making good volumes of urine. On PPD 2, he maintained his
saturations in the high 90's on 3L nasal cannula, which back to
his baseline. He [**Date Range 1834**] a physical therapy evaluation and was
deemed a good candidate for pulmonary rehab. He was discharged
in similar condition to his baseline and will require
supplemental 02 and CPAP/BiPAP on an ongoing basis.

He was transferred to [**Hospital **] Medical Center for CPAP/BiPAP
work-up.
