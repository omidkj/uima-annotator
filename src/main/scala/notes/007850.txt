Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
spinal stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
total laminectomy L3-L5 ([**2149-1-27**])


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11202**] is an 80yo male with CAD s/p MI and PTCI,
carotid stenosis s/p CEA, OSA, obesity, hypothyroidism, CKD
(baseline Cr ~1.7), spinal stenosis s/p total laminectomy L3-L5
on [**2149-1-27**], who is transferred from ortho-spine to MICU in
setting of altered mental status, fevers to 102, chest pain, and
episode of unresponsiveness earlier today.
.
Patient initially admitted to ortho service [**2149-1-27**] for elective
laminectomy. Underwent total laminectomy of L3-L5; fusion L3-L5;
instrumentation of L3-L5, autograft, and epidural catheter
placement on day of admission. Tolerated procedure well, with
~600cc EBL, and 2L IVF administration during procedure. Pain
initially treated with dialudid PCA, and patient had since been
transitioned to oral pain meds. His hospital course has been c/b
transient hyperkalemia yesterday (K 6.0), which resolved with
administration of kayexalate x2.
.
Per reports, patient was at his baseline mental status this
morning, but became more confused over the course of the day.
Also became febrile to 102, and medicine consultation was
requested. Given concern for AMS secondary to narcotic pain med
administration, patient received Narcan x2 with good response.
He received 40mg PO oxycodone yesterday; today had received
dilaudid 0.5mg IV x2. Mental status was still slightly altered
per his family, who were present at time of medicine consult
interview. At that time, RR was about 12, and patient was unable
to keep his eyes open for more than 10 seconds at a time. Was
still responsive to commands. ABG revealed 7.38/46/85/28 on 3L
NC, and of note patient has required supplemental O2 since the
OR.
.
Patient then developed substernal CP, non-radiating, with
associated SOB and nausea per his report. As an EKG was being
obtained, he was unresponsive for 10 seconds (per nursing), then
aroused, somewhat confused with SBP ~110. Telemetry showed that
he switched into Afib approximately at this time with rate
around 100. EKG confirmed Afib, but there was no evidence of
ischemic changes. ASA 325mg ordered (d/w ortho-spine). Cardiac
enyzmes sent: trop 0.05, CK 888, MB flat. Given fever to 102,
blood and urine cultures also sent, and UA returned suggestive
of UTI. CXR not concerning for PNA.
.
Ortho spine attending requested transfer to medicine overnight
for management of delirium, fevers, chest pain. Decision was
made to transfer patient to MICU given recent onset and acuity
of these issues.
.
On arrival to MICU, patient no longer reports CP. Still reports
SOB, though cannot characterize the nature of his dyspnea. No
orthopnea. Reports back pain at surgical site, as well as
suprapubic pain. Had nausea earlier with CP, which has since
resolved. No emesis. CP was substernal, non-radiating, and not
associated with any diaphoresis.

V. Cardiology

A. Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2149-1-30**]  3:29:16 PM


Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block. Poor R wave
progression in the  anterior leads. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2149-1-21**] no significant  diagnostic change.


  Intervals Axes
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T

B. ECHO ([**2149-2-3**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality with improved visualization
with Definity contrast. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2144**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
