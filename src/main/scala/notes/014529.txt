History of Present Illness:
67 year old male with CAD s/p CABG in [**2100**] and recent
catherization with BMS to SVG-RCA admitted from PCP's office's
for hypotension. He went to [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**2-28**] with chest pain and
shortness of breath. He had a stress test that showed reversible
inferior ischemia and was cathed on [**3-4**]. BMS was placed to
SVG-RCA. He was discharged on [**3-7**]. On [**3-11**] he went to PCP with
complaints of right groin pain. His INR was noted to be 3.8 and
he was told to stop coumadin and levonox which were started at
[**Hospital1 2025**] for afib. On [**3-13**], he followed up with his PCP and reported
worsening right groin pain and was found to be hypotensive and
pale with BP in the 70's. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 100.0, 100, 74/42, 19, 96% on
RA. Hct was 26.8, baseline about 30. He was started on 1unit of
PRBC. Central line was placed. He was given 4L of NS and was on
levophed. His INR was 3.1 and was given vitamin K and 2U FFP. He
was given asa and plavix. He was given vanc and ceftriaxone. His
mental status was never comprimised and he made some urine
during his ED course. Cards consult was called and bedside echo
did not show new WMA and no pericardial effusion. His cardiac
marker was not dramatically elevated. EKG had RBBB which is old.
Abd CT ruled out retroperitoneal hematoma but revealed a right
groin intramuscular hematoma. Vascular consult was called and
there are no plans for surgery. He was admitted to the CCU for
further care.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT  [**2120-3-13**] 8:04 PM

FEMORAL VASCULAR US RIGHT

Reason: RT FEM ART. S/P HEART CATH, HYPOTENSIVE, HEMATOMA ON CT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old man w/R fem hematoma ?active bleed; s/p R groin
entry for cardiac cath 2 wks ago; now hypotensive
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
duplex ultrasound of R fem art
RIGHT FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND

INDICATION: 67-year-old with right groin hematoma, question
active extravasation, rule out pseudoaneurysm.

COMPARISON: CT and ultrasound performed earlier today.

FINDINGS: Redemonstrated is a large heterogeneous focus in the
right inguinal area deep to the femoral vessels. This
corresponds with intramuscular hematoma noted on CT. No
significant vascular flow or connection to the femoral vessels
is demonstrated. Normal waveforms are demonstrated in the right
common femoral artery and vein.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm. Hematoma noted
.
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2120-3-13**] 3:16 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for RP bleed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old s/p recent cardiac cath in R groin at [**Hospital1 **], now with
R groin pain, "lump", and hypotension, gen fatigue. BP 70s.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for RP bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST

INDICATION: 67-year-old man post-recent cardiac catheterization,
presenting with groin pain, mass, and hypotension. Evaluate for
retroperitoneal hematoma.

COMPARISON: Not available.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of abdomen and pelvis were obtained
without administration of oral or intravenous contrast. Coronal
and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is dependent
atelectasis at lung bases bilaterally. Thoracic and abdominal
aorta contain extensive calcification. Eventration of the left
hemidiaphragm is noted. Non-contrast evaluation of the liver,
gallbladder, spleen, right adrenal gland, pancreas is
unremarkable. There is nodular thickening of the left adrenal
gland. There is fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal
aorta, measuring up to 3.4 cm in AP diameter. There is no free
air and no free fluid in the abdomen. There are no
pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph
nodes. There is diverticulosis of the descending colon without
evidence of acute diverticulitis. Normal appendix is seen. Small
bowel loops are normal, given lack of oral contrast. There is no
retroperitoneal hematoma.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is extensive
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon without evidence of acute
diverticulitis.
