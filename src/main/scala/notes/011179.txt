Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Zithromax

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental status change, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
drainage of psoas abscess x 2.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a 43 yo female with a h/o LBP (thoracic and diffuse
lumbar)after a bus accident in [**10-25**], who presents with acute
mental status change, fever, agitation, and increasing lower
back pain. She originally was brought to her PCP office by her
partner on [**12-2**] after worsening LBP and fever and new onset
rambling tangential speech, agitation, confusion, and tremors.
PCP sent her to [**Hospital1 **] ED. VS upon presentation 101.2,
141/87, 99%RA and noted to be diffusely flushed and tachycardic.
She was given 1L NS, ceftriaxone 2g IV x1, and valium 5mg IV x1.
Neurologic exam was nonfocal but limited secondary to pain. DDx
was NMS, meningitis, TCA toxicity secondary to flexeril or
compazine, or epidural abscess. ECG was within normal limits
with exception of sinus tachycardia, no QRS widening suggesting
TCA toxicity. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for toxicology
evaluation, MRI and neurologic evaluation secondary to there
being no unit beds at [**Hospital1 **].
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], Tmax 103.8, tachycardia persisted and BP
ranged 115/72-153/102. She received 3L NS and 1g vancomycin IV.
Acyclovir IV was also ordered for concern of herpes encephalitis
but it is not clear if this was administered. Given serum tox
screen positive for TCAs, 2mg physostigmine IV was administered
for concern of anticholinergic overdose without change in mental
status. Attempts at MRI initially failed due to agitation
despite 4mg ativan IV; pt was intubated for sedation. She
received 20mg IV etomidate, 120mg IV succinylcholine, and
propofol gtt. MRI revealed a right psoas abscess extending into
the epidural space. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] spine for emergent
drainage. Underwent laminectomy of L3-4 with drainage of
nonpurulent material.

Pertinent Results:
Micro:

BlCx [**12-4**]: NGTD
BlCx [**12-5**]: NGTD
BlCx: [**12-6**]: NGTD
BlCx: [**12-8**]: NGTD
UCx [**12-4**]: lactobacillus vs. alpha strep.
Abscess Culture [**12-10**]: MRSA.

.
EKG: pending
.
Radiology:
MRI of T and L spine:
1.  Small T6-7 cephalad extruded disc herniation.
2.  Findings most consistent with a right psoas inflammatory
process and associated epidural abscess. Possible right iliacus
muscle infection, as well. Neoplastic disease causing a similar
appearance in the lumbar region is a secondary diagnosis.
.
CT head:
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Meningitis cannot be
excluded.
.
CXR:
1)  Status post intubation with tip at the thoracic inlet.
2)  Worsening failure - now moderate

CT abd [**12-9**]: 1. Multiple bibasilar pulmonary nodulular
densities, difficult to compare to the prior study. Two of these
show tiny central hypoattenuation, raising the possibility of
cavitation, and accordingly, septic emboli are one possibility.
2. Interval increase in size and definition of psoas abscess,
which now demonstrates a 25-mm diameter fluid collection (in
axial dimensions

CT guided drainage of abscess [**12-10**]: Successful CT-guided
aspiration of psoas collection. Because of adjacent nerve
stimulation, likely of a branch of the femoral nerve, the
catheter could not be safely discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan: Pt is a 43 y.o. female with history of
psoriasis who presented to OSH with change in mental status,
fevers, and low back pain, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further work up and on MRI was found to have an epidural
abscess.  She was taken to the OR, the presumed abscess drained
non purulent material..
.
# Epidural/psoas abscess - Low back pain, fevers, elevated WBC
with bandemia are all consistent with epidural abscess as seen
on MRI of spine.  Patient had a back injury after hitting a
large pothole while driving her bus 5 weeks ago and has had
continued low back pain. It was postulated that this episode may
have been the incident which caused compression of the spinal
cord and served as a nidus for infection and subsequent
bacteremia. [**1-24**] blood culture bottles from OSH on [**12-2**] grew
MRSA, and the pt underwent a laminectomy. She continued to spike
fevers and have back pain with an elevated WBC, however,
initially there was resistance to try to drain the abscess again
since it was relatively small. However, on [**12-9**] a repeat CT
showed interval increase in the size and the abscess was drained
via CT guidance. A catheter was attempted to be placed, however,
the pt experienced severe leg pain when this was positioned, and
thus the catheter was not left in place. The IR physicians
stated that approx 8cc of pus was removed and this was estimated
to be >50% of the remaining abscess. It is hoped that enough was
removed so that the pt will be able to fight off the remainder
of the infection without a catheter in place. She will continue
on IV vancomycin for at least 6 weeks and was discharged with
VNA services and close followup with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] spine, and
ID. Pain was treated with oxycodone prn, but the pt stated she
was anxious to get off of these medications and would likely
continue with ibuprofren if needed.

# Sepsis: Pt was initially felt to be septic [**1-22**] the abscess and
bacteremia. Echo did not show endocarditis or any valvular
abnormalities. She was initially placed on vanco and gentamicin,
and then when cultures returned with MRSA the gent was taken
off. Septic emboli were seen on subsequent CT in the lungs,
however continued to have good O2sats and clinically improved
after the abscess was drained for the 2nd time. She will
followup closely and it will be important to obtain another
echocardiogram if a new murmur develops.
.
# MS changes: pt's family noted that pt had been "crazy" before
presentation with severe agitation and "not making sense".
Throughout most of her hospitalization she remained confused and
would speak tangentially. She would become extremely emotionally
labile, crying and yelling. Her family continued to state that
this was very different from her baseline. Once her abscess was
drained for the 2nd time and her fevers resolved, she began to
become much more coherent and could carry on relatively normal
conversations. She appeared to be very close to her baseline on
discharge.
.
# Respiratory status- Pt was initially intubated secondary to
severe agitation and inability to perform MRI and without it.
She was extubated afterwards with no difficulty.
.
# Anemia - this was felt to be likely operative blood loss,
phlebotomy and dilution with fluid administration, no trace
guaiac positivity. Hct remained relatively stable in the high
20's. She was given folate and thiamine in house [**1-22**]
macrocytosis. She can follow up with her PCP for further workup.

.
# Guttate psoriasis - stable.
Defer to outpt tx, phototherapy
.
# tobacco dependence: pt would not accept a nicotine patch.
However, she made it through
