Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
76M history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the neck,
radiation/chemo, complains of worsening shortness of breath and
acutely worsened dysphagea today.  Patient states that since
this morning, he has felt a "choking" sensation around his
throat and thinks that his tumor is moving inward toward his
airway.  He has felt short of breath, has coughed up some clear
phlegm, but has denied fever, chills, excessive sputum
production, or upper respiratory symptoms.  He has had
odynophagea for the past month since he's been receiving XRT,
and this is slightly worse today as well.  He was able to
swallow a cup of food earlier today as well as a small amount of
water, which is how much he's been able to take in orally
recently. He denies fever, chills, chest pain, nausea/vomiting.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.8 72 143/61 18 100%(RA). Patient
was given Decadron 10 mg IV. A CT neck was obtained that showed
mass around sternal notch is larger but not impinging on airway.
 Labs were significant for Hct 33 (at or higher than previous
baseline), WBC 2.3, Lactate 1.4.  Blood and urine cultures were
sent. There was no evidence of airway compromise or hemodynamic
instability during his ED stay. He is being admitted to the ICU
for airway monitoring. VS on transfer were: 98.7, 82,129/73, 20,
100% 2L.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient's vitals were: T98.3 HR69
BP152/60 RR19 O2sat 98% (2L).  His dyspnea was improved after
decadron and oxygen, although he still feels short of breath.
His odynophagea remains as it was in the morning.  Patient is
comfortable and denies chest pain.

Imaging Studies:
CT neck [**7-26**]: Known mass centered in the sternal notch is larger
in size with increased central low density most compatbile with
necrosis, though no impingement on the airway.
.
CXR [**7-26**]: Superior mediastinum somewhat obscured by a known
partially cystic mass as better delineated on current CT
examination of neck. Lungs are clear, no pleural effusions, or
PTX. Cardiac mediastinal contours are unremarkable. No acute
cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
76M with invasive squamous cell carcinoma in area of manubrium,
presents with shortness of breath, concerning for impingment of
tumor on trachea, admitted to ICU for airway management.

Active Diagnoses:
# Respiratory Distress: On admission, the patient endorses a
subjective sense of SOB, but O2 sat is 100% RA and respiratory
rate is normal.  He has hx of invasive SCC overlying manubrium,
but by CT tumor is not impinging on trachea.  He was given
dexamethasone 10mg IV x3 over 24 hours to reduce swelling.  ENT
was consulted and performed laryngoscopy.  This revealed minimal
supraglottic edema and erythema that could likely represent
early post-radiation changes versus reflux.  There was also
minimal paradoxical motion of his vocal cords that may
contribute to dyspnea.  His airway was otherwise open.  Per
their recommendation, he was given an increased dose of his home
PPI to reduce any reflux that might exacerbate his breathing.
He was given a total of 3 doses of Decadron 10mg to prevent
airway swelling.  During his stay he continued to have good
oxygen saturation.  On the third day of admission, given his
improvement and stability, he was discharged home after
receiving previously scheduled radiation therapy.

# Dysphagia/Odynophagia: Likely esophagitis/mucositis related to
radiation therapy effect, as the timing coincides and this is a
known side effect.  Patient endorses pain upon swallowing and
frequently becomes dehydrated secondary to poor PO intake from
odynophagia.  He comes in frequently for IV hydration, but has
been trying to transition to PEG tube and oral hydration.  On
admission, he BUN was slightly elevated which may be sign of
hypovolemia.  He was given IV fluid and encouraged to take in
fluids PO as much as possible.  He was given several liquid pain
relief agents.

# Esophagitis:  Patient has no recollection of being on
Protonix, but recent EGD for placement of PEG noted moderate to
severe esophagitis and recommended [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  This was continued
during his stay per ENT recs as mentioned above.

Chronic Diagnoses:
# Anemia.  Patient's Hct at presentation was 33, above his
baseline (~30), which is low likely [**1-2**] chemo. He received 1
unit pRBCs on [**7-24**] for sxs of fatigue with bump from 26.8 to
33.0. His hct trended down to 28 by discharge, but this was not
felt to be significant enough of a decrease to treat.

# Leukopenia.  WBC 2.3, ANC 1541 on presentation, so patient was
not neutropenic.  He likely has chemo-induced leukopenia.  He
was monitored for fever and signs of infection.

# CAD. Status post DES to RCA after unstable angina [**2158-1-16**]
(3 Xience DES placed to RCA).  Recath with diffuse and severe
CAD and left main and LAD/LCX disease leading to CABG [**2158-1-12**]
in [**State 38104**] (LIMA to
