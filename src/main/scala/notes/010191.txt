Service:  CCU/MEDICINE
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13143**] is a
45-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of
hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia and gout who
was in his usual state of health until 2:00 a.m. on the day
of admission.  At that time, the patient was awakened by
associated with diaphoresis.  The pain resolved spontaneously
after ten minutes but then recurred 20 minutes later, [**7-31**] in
intensity and again associated with diaphoresis.  It was also
associated this time with dizziness and the pain was
radiating into his sternal area.  There was no associated
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.

the Emergency Department by his wife who is a nurse
practitioner. He was taken via ambulance.  His pain at that
time was [**1-1**] after two sublingual nitroglycerin.  At the
outside hospital, the patient was found to have ST
depressions in leads II, III, and aVF and he was hypertensive
with a blood pressure of 200/110.  He was given sublingual
nitroglycerin, heparin drip, and beta blocked and
subsequently experienced a witnessed V-fib arrest and
required shocking with 200 joules.

He returned to sinus bradycardia and then a normal sinus
rhythm.  He was started on a lidocaine drip and then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] Cath lab for persistent
discomfort/chest pain.

At cardiac catheterization, the patient had the following
hemodynamics.  Cardiac output was 5.24 with a cardiac index
of 2.48.  The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was elevated
at 26 and his right atrial pressure was 13.  On angiography
he had a left dominant system with luminal irregularities in
the LAD, 30% stenosis of the left circumflex, and the
patient's ramus was completely occluded.  The ramus was
Angio-Jetted and then stented with restoration of TIMI-III
flow.

The patient was then transferred to the CCU.  On review of
systems in the CCU, the patient denied chest pain, shortness
of breath.  On review of systems, he states that he was
noticing minimal bilateral lower extremity edema prior to
admission but denied dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, PND, or
palpitations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN THE CCU:  Vitals:  Temperature 98,
blood pressure 127/56, pulse 82, saturation 96% on 2 liters
nasal cannula.  The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter in
place.  In general, the patient was lying in bed in no
apparent distress.  He was speaking in full sentences.
HEENT:  The pupils were equal, reactive, and round to light
and accommodation.  The oropharynx was clear and dry.  He was
anicteric.  The neck was supple.  No bruits.  JVP could not
be adequately assessed.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
anteriorly and laterally.  His abdominal examination revealed
a soft abdomen, nontender, nondistended, no masses.  Arterial
and venous sheaths were in place in the right groin without
hematoma or ooze.  His pulses were full times four, warm and
well perfuse.  The neurological examination was grossly
intact.

LABORATORY DATA AND OTHER STUDIES:  The patient's EKG in the
CCU was normal sinus at 93, axis within normal limits,
intervals within normal limits.  His EKG showed right atrial
enlargement and T wave flattening in leads F and aVL.

He had a hematocrit of 39.7, white count 15.7, hemoglobin
13.3, platelet count 271,000.  Chemistries revealed a sodium
of 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 101, bicarbonate 25, BUN 19,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.  His magnesium was 1.5.  His
first CK was 1506 with an MB of 232.  Prior CKs at the
outside hospital included a CK of 169 with an MB of 2.2 and a
troponin of 0.15.

Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed clear lung fields
and no cardiomegaly.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Gout.
2.  Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia; at last
check total cholesterol 278 with a triglyceride level of
1,000.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral knee menisci repair.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Lipitor 20 q.d.
2.  Tums p.r.n.
3.  Indocin p.r.n. for gout.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works in IT for [**Company **].
He is married and lives with his wife and son.  [**Name (NI) **] is a
nonsmoker.  He does not use intravenous drugs.  He drinks
6-12 beers per week.

FAMILY HISTORY:
1.  Mother with MI at age 42.
2.  Father with CVA at age 68.  The patient's father also
suffered from gout.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIAC:  From a cardiac standpoint, the patient is
status post his first MI which was in the ramus
distribution.  He also had symptoms of CHF with elevated
wedge pressures and left-sided pressures.  The patient was
placed on metoprolol, Captopril, and was given Lasix 20 mg IV
times one to mobilize the fluid from his elevated pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure.

The patient was also placed on aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Status post stenting of the ramus, he was placed on Plavix 75
q.d. which to be continued for nine months status post
stenting.  The patient's CK peaked at 1,711 on the evening of
[**2164-11-18**] and then on [**2164-11-19**] his CK was 1380, on [**2164-11-20**],
the day of discharge, his CK had fallen to 409.

The patient's cholesterol panel came back with a total
cholesterol of 209, HDL 42, calculated LDL of 90 and a
triglyceride level of 386 with a cholesterol to HDL ratio of
5.  Realizing that these levels are not accurate during an
acute event, the patient was continued on his outpatient
regimen of Lipitor 20 q.d. and was told to follow-up with his
outpatient cardiologist for remeasurement of the cholesterol
panel and appropriate adjustment of his Lipitor dosage.

The patient's LFTs were also checked on [**2164-11-20**] as he was
being continued on a statin.  His ALT was slightly elevated
at 73.  His AST was essentially within normal limits at 48,
alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin were normal at 94
and 0.7 respectively.  The patient was old to follow-up with his
primary cardiologist regarding appropriate dosage of the statin.

RHYTHM:  From a rhythm standpoint, the patient was status
post V-fib arrest in the setting of an MI.  He was placed on
telemetry and monitored closely for recurrent episodes of
V-tach.  He had one episode on [**2164-11-19**] of a 14-beat run of
V-tach that was asymptomatic.  His electrolytes were within
normal limits including his magnesium which had been repleted
and was 2.2 at the time of the arrhythmia.  The patient was
kept on telemetry through [**2164-11-20**] and had no recurrent
episodes of V-tach or nonsustained V-tach or PVCs for that
matter.

The patient had an echocardiogram to help risk stratify  him.
His echocardiogram showed a normal EF of 55%.  The left
atrium had a normal size.  The left ventricle had normal wall
thickness.  Cavity size and systolic function was within
normal limits with no noted wall motion abnormalities.  His
right atrium was normal size as well as his right ventricle.
His valves were all stated to be structurally normal.  He had
mild mitral annular calcification with trivial MR.

It was felt that the patient would not require an EP study
with this normal EF and with no recurrence of the ventricular
arrhythmia.  The patient had originally been on a lidocaine
drip and this was discontinued 24 hours after his event.

PUMP FUNCTION:  As stated, above this was completely normal
on his echocardiogram with an EF of 55%.

CARDIAC FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was to see his primary care
physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few days after discharge, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at
[**Hospital3 1196**].  His primary care physician will
refer him to a cardiologist at [**Hospital1 **].

Of note, the patient's wife is a nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] and is very involved in the patient's care.
She has already arranged for the patient to follow-up in
cardiac rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **].  The patient was
advised to take a week off from work and attend cardiac
rehabilitation.

He was seen by physical therapy during his stay and was able
to walk two flight of stairs without chest pain or shortness
of breath.
