Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18141**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Insertion of peripherally inserted central catheter
Revision of right nephrostomy tube

History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's
dementia, recurrent urinary tract infections and urosepsis in
the setting of bilateral obstructing nephrolithiasis, S/P right
nephrostomy tube placement who presented from nursing home with
fever and hypotension. At baseline, she is non-verbal, G-tube
dependent and unable to perform ADLs. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was previously
admitted on [**5-10**] with urosepsis (E. coli & Strep milleri). She
had bilateral obstructing renal stones requiring percutaneous
nephrostomy tube on the right and also found to have a
uterosigmoid fistula. She was treated with sepsis protocol, 1
week of steroids and 2 week antibiotic course.
The pt's daughter notes that about 4 days prior to admission,
her urine color has changed and she has been looking around the
room less. She was started on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole 4
days PTA.
In the ED temperature was 102.8, BP 66/48, HR 104. Lacatate was
6.0. After discussion with family regarding code status, she was
started on the sepsis protocol, receiving 2L of NS, and started
on piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and metronidazole as
well as dopamine. On arrival to MICU, BP 97/44, HR 92, 99% on
100% NRB. Pt is non-conversant and so the daughter states that
she would want the pt intubated if this was thought to be
related to a reversible cause.
.
While in the MICU, patient was found to have mild right and
moderate left hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound. She
subsequently went to interventional radiology, where right
nephrostomy tube was changed, and no new left nephrostomy
inserted due to resolution of left hydronephrosis. She was
initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics and pressors but
was eventually stabilized and transferred on
piperacillin/Tazobactam

Pertinent Results:
Labs on admission: WBC 47.9 (90% neutrophils, 3% bands, 2%
lymphs), Hgb 10.9, Hct 31.2, Plt 300

potassium 5.8, bicarb 19, lactate 6
.
TTE [**2101-6-9**]:
 Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent) secondary to
extensive apical akinesis. A moderate sized thrombus is seen in
the apex of the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. Trivial MR, mod [**Last Name (un) 6879**], small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2101-5-31**], an apical left ventricular thrombus is now
evident.
.
Renal ultrasound ([**9-21**]): 1. Right-sided nephrostomy tube with
decompression of the right collecting system, with only mild
upper pole hydronephrosis seen.
2. New moderate-to-severe left-sided hydronephrosis. Given
patient's history of sepsis, this is concerning for an
obstructing nephropathy. Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6812**] following
completion of the study.
.
CXR ([**9-21**]): 1. Fluid overload. 2. Indistinctness of the left
hemidiaphragm, which may represent atelectasis and/or
consolidation.
.
Nephrostomy check ([**9-23**]): Uneventful change of right
percutaneous pigtail nephrostomy catheter. No hydronephrosis.
Persistent obstruction of the distal right ureter.  Interval
resolution of left hydronephrosis, obviating the need for left
percutaneous nephrostomy at this time.
.
PICC line placement ([**9-26**]): Successful placement of a 5-French
double lumen 34 cm PICC by way of the right basilic vein with
the tip in the distal SVC. The line is ready for use.
.
ECHO ([**9-27**]): 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Basal inferior
hypokinesis is present.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is a small pericardial effusion with fibrin/thrombus on
the surface of the heart.
6. Compared to prior study on [**2101-6-9**], the LV apical thrombus
is no longer seen and the PA pressure is now normal. LV function
may have improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 87 year old female with a history of Alzheimer's
and prior urosepsis who presented with sepsis from a urinary
source once again and who is now status post right nephrostomy
tube & on antibiotics.
.
# Sepsis: The patient's presentation was most consistent with
urosepsis. Her right nephrostomy tube was changed by IR on
[**9-23**]. Left hydronephrosis found on initial ultrasound was
resolved by the time of IR intervention, and a left nephrostomy
tube was not needed. The patient was initially in the MICU but
was transferred on PIP/TAZO, having received 5 days, on [**9-25**].
Her blood cultures as well as urine cultures show E. Coli
sensitive to PIP/TAZO and ceftriaxone.
- On arrival to the floor, her antibiotic was changed to
ceftriaxone 1g IV q24 since strain is susceptible on culture
data. Ceftriaxone was started on [**9-25**], and the plan is to
continue the antibiotic until [**10-4**].
- The patient had a PICC line placed without problem on [**9-26**]
for IV antibiotics.
- Her white count has steadily decreased and she has been
afebrile for several days.
- The patient should have an outpatient renal ultrasound in a
few weeks in order to reassess the functionality of the
nephrostomy tube and to ensure that hydronephrosis has not
reaccumulated on the left side.
.
# Leukocytosis: The patient's white count continues to decrease,
and the patient continues to be afebrile. A slight increase in
her white blood cell count two days ago is likely related to
blockage of nephrostomy tube (nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 67863**] in closed
position and corrected this). Also, many white blood cells still
in urine (nephrostomy < regular UA).
- She is on ceftriaxone to continue until [**10-4**] as above.
- As patient is afebrile, will not
