suggestive of possible aspiration. Bilateral large pleural

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 44yoF with history of etoh abuse and chronic
pancreatitis w/multiple complications who is transferred from
OSH per family request for management of pancreatitis and fever.

.
# Chronic Pancreatitis: Patient's CT abdomen showed evidnece of
chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient was
continued on her home pancreatic enzyme supplementation, but was
not taking pos very well and was then started on TPN. She had
some diarrhea, which improved with uptitration of her pancreatic
enzymes, and this can be continued to be increased as her po
intake improves.

# Fever: Unclear etiology; possibly due to pancreatitis vs PNA,
as CXR and CT chest concerning for BL PNA.  The patient was
covered broadly w/Vanc, Zosyn for presumed aspiration pneumonia
and will need to complete a 10 day course. Pt also had line
placed at OSH which was subsequently removed. Blood and urine
cultures were obtained and all cultures, including those from
OSH were negative.

# Anemia: Pt had guiac + stools at OSH.  CT consistant with
esophageal varicies. Her hematocrit remained stable.

# Hyponatremia: Sodium was 127 on arrival but resolved with IV
fluid boluses.

# Thrombocytopenia: Likely due to cirrhosis.  Stable

# Altered mental status: Patient oriented to self only on
arrival.  A lactulose enema was given on admission with no
improvement.  Possible infectious source rather than hepatic
encephalopathy. CT head was unremarkable.

# Cirrhosis: GI was consulted and CT of the abdomen was
obtained.  Imaging with evidence of diffuse anasarca, large
amount of acites and chronic pancreatic changes.  A u/s guided
paracentesis was obtained and cultures were sent. This was
negative.She was started on Lasix/aldactone.

# h/o ETOH abuse: Patient was initially placed on CIWA scale,
recieved minimal ativan. No evidence of acute withdrawal.  Now
holding benzos due to mental status.

# Stage I coccygeal ulcer: wound care consulted.

# FEN: Patient severly cachetic and nutritionally depleted.
Speech/swallow evaluation cleared patient for nectar thick
liquids and purees.  TPN was initiated and will need to continue
until patient is taking adequate po intake. Calorie counts will
need to be performed while at rehab for consideration of
discontinuation of TPN.

# PPx: PPI, heparin SC

# Code: Full
