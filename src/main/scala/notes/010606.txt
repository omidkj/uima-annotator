Chief Complaint:
ICU Tx from OSH for GTC sz

Brain Biopsy
Tracheostomy
PEG tube placement
Intubation
PICC line placement
Lumbar puncture
IVC filter placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 57 yo ?-handed woman with a history of
obesity and Crohn's disease who presented to OSH [**11-30**] with GTC
seizure (first time). History is per chart as patient is
currently intubated.

Weeks prior she had developed a slight headaches (no information
regarding quality and location of HA available), mainly in the
mornings. These would occur daily without any accompanying
symptoms.  One day prior to presentation to OSH, the patient
developed blurred vision, HA, a strange sensation in her mouth
and she had to vomit. On the day of presentation she was feeling
fine until she had troubles getting words out. She then fell to
the floor and had a GTC seizure that lasted for about 5 minutes
(witnessed by her husband). At the ED of OSH, a head CT was
negative and she was discharged home with appointments for
further workup as outpatient. The same evening she had 3 more
GTC
seizures. These started focally with L-arm numbness followed by
L-arm shaking. Postictally, weakness was noted in the L-arm. She
also was incontinent for urine. A repeat CT was negative and an
LP showed 1WBC and 52 RBC, glc 96, prot 33. She had a normal
WBC,
was afebrile at that point and did not have meningismus. She was
loaded on dilantin (1g), given maintenance of 100mg TID (with
trough [**12-2**] of 12). She was noted to have twitching of the
L-arm
and L-leg, with interictally altered consiousness and L-sided
weakness. She was emperically given acyclovir, vanco,
gentamycin,
and CTX on [**12-1**]; all d/c-ed on [**12-2**].
MRI on [**12-1**] showed parasagittal, bihemispheric infarcts on DWI
(along the falx), periventricular white matter changes on FLAIR.
She was given solumedrol 1gram for ? of vasculitis.
CTA/CTV head [**12-1**] showed some small filling defects in the
superior sagittal sinus. An MRV was not performed.
 Later that day she was intubated as she became increasingly
lethargic in between the seizures (airway protection). She was
then maintained on propofol until transfer. On the day of
transfer ([**12-2**]) she developed a low grade fever 100.2. Her
dilantin trough [**12-2**] was 12, after which she was given another
500mg dilantin iv.

Upon transfer, the patient had a temp of 101.3. She was noted to
have trhythmic movements involving her L-arm more than her R-arm
and some internal rotation of her legs (also rhythmically).
Prior
to transfer she received 2mg of ativan. Shortly after transfer
she received 2mg ativan x3 and received another dose of dilantin
(10mg/kg, i.e. 900mg).
Of note the patient is allergic to shellfish and had undergone a
CT with contrast.

[**12-2**]:MRI/A/V of head:There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus, or
shift of the normally midline structures. There are multiple
bilateral regions of subacute infarction with regions of
cortical restricted diffusion and T2 hyperintensity. The most
extensive region involves the right insular cortex and the
parietal cortex, more posteriorly, on the right. There is also a
smaller infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory as
well. In addition, there are bilateral subacute infarcts in the
medial frontal lobes bilaterally, more extensive on the right
than the left, involing portions of both anterior cerebral
artery territories. The posterior cerebral artery territories
appear spared. All of the infarcted regions show subtle gyriform
enhancement following gadolinium administration.

Both cerebral hemispheres also demonstrate scattered foci of T2
hyperintensity without associated restricted diffusion or
enhancement. These are probably more chronic in character. There
are also multiple tiny bilateral punctate foci of susceptibility
artifact, which could possibly represent hemorrhagic residua
from prior small-vessel infarctions. The cerebellum and
brainstem are spared. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.

MR ANGIOGRAM: The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]
appear patent. There are no areas of significant stenosis or
aneurysmal dilatation. No sign of arteriovenous malformation is
apparent within the limits of coverage of the study. There is a
small right vertebral artery, which probably ends as a posterior
inferior cerebellar artery.

MR VENOGRAM: The major intracranial venous sinuses, cerebral
vein of [**Male First Name (un) 2096**], and internal cerebral vein appear patent.
----
[**12-7**]:MRI/A of head:There is no extra-axial fluid collection.
There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of the normally
midline structures. The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are
unremarkable, without effacement.

middle and anterior
