Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 83 yo m with pmh of atrial flutter, hypertension,
myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], type 2 diabetes, colon cancer s/p
hemicolectomy, COPD, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism
presented to osh with afib in rvr, dehydration and altered
mental status.
.
On [**6-27**], day of osh admission, pt was weak and confused.  At
that time, he denied chest pain, abd pain, headache, visual
changes, rashes.  His exact history was unattainable due to
patient's confusion.
.
OSH course: At osh, pt's hr was found to be 160's a flutter.
head ct was neg. Patient was having difficulty with word
finding, speech, and was very agitated-- rec'd ativan, haldol.
He was started on an esmolol drip until today [**6-29**] and then
started on metoprolol 50 po x 1. CE neg x 2. ABG this a.m. was
7.34/33/93 on 2L nc.
.
Pt was seen by neurology who thought that confusion may be a
result of toxic encepalopathy possibly from mestinon, his
medication for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]. He was initially admitted to
the MICU and found to be in ARF, which resolved with IVF.  He
was also found to have a methacillin resistant coag negative
staph bacteremia of unclear source as the patient did not have
any indwelling lines or catheters.  He was started on Vancomycin
for this infection.  He was found to have a right inguinal
hernia and was seen by surgery, but no intervention was deemed
necessary.
.
He was stabilized and transferred to the medicine floor for
further workup of his acute mental status changes.

.
CT head:  There is no hemorrhage, mass, shift of normally
midline structures, or hydrocephalus. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. No infarction is apparent. The
sulci and ventricles are prominent consistent with generalized
atrophy. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells
are normally aerated. A NG tube is seen traversing the left
nostril.
.
RUE Ultrasound: no DVT
.
Echo: Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%)
INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2145-10-29**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function. TDI
E/e' < 8,
suggesting normal PCWP (<12mmHg).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No masses or  vegetations on aortic valve. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No
mass or
vegetation on mitral valve. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. No mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve. Moderate PA
systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional  left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a  normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)  are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or  vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve  prolapse. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral

regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Mild
LVH with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2145-10-29**], pulmonary hypertension is more severe.
The other findings are similar.
.
EEG:
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and
disorganized background rhythm as well as the bursts of
generalized
slowing. These abnormalities are suggestive of a moderate
encephalopathy which may be seen with medications, toxic
metabolic
abnormalities, or infections. There were no regions of focal
slowing
and no epileptiform discharges noted. Of note, there was an
irregularly
irregular rhythm with a tachycardic rate of 120 bpm.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 83 year old gentleman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**],
atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic kidney disease,
diabetes and hypothyroidism was admitted from an outside
hospital for subacute mental status change.  He was initially
admitted to the MICU.  Over the first few days the patient was
somnolent and incoherent when aroused.  It was also noted the
patient was producing a lot of secretions in his mouth and
required frequent suctioning.   A head CT was notable only for
diffuse atrophy.  A chest x-ray was not revealing, but zosyn was
began empirically given his secretions.  LP was not pursued as
the likelihood of CNS infection was believed low.  The patient
would occasionally go into atrial fibrillation with RVR but with
no hemodynamic instability; initially on an esmolol drip which
was weaned off and replaced with diltiazem PO.  Digoxin, started
at the OSH, was discontinued
.
It was unclear what was the cause of this gentleman's mental
status change; he had previously been interac
