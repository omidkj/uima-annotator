Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Decompensated CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, central line, arterial line, EGD

History of Present Illness:
85 yoM with AF on coumadin s/p pacemaker [**2-/2192**] admitted for
decompensated CHF and transferred to the CCU s/p PEA arrest.
See [**Hospital1 1516**] note for more details, but in summary, pt admitted for
worsening DOE and LE swelling over several days.  His outpatient
cardiologist did a TTE which he read as normal.  Pt admitted to
the [**Hospital1 1516**] service where a TTE was repeated, showing mild apical
hypokinesis but preserved EF.  Given the focal area of
involvement, an ischemic etiology was considered although per
Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**], this may have been related to dyssynchrony.  The
patient was diuresed and coumadin held while awaiting cardiac
catheterization tomorrow.  In the interim, he did have a
witnessed fall yesterday - reported by roommate to have
collapsed; no event on telemetry, and CT head unremarkable.  His
mental status seemed to have waned somewhat today, so CT head
was repeated, which again was unremarkable.
.
This evening around 5pm, the pt developed chest pain.  His EKG
showed new lateral TWI.  Pt was then noticed to become cyanotic;
O2 sat 60% on pleth but tracing poor.  He subsequently became
pulseless, and a code blue called.  Compressions were initiated,
and pt received epinephrine x1.  Rhythm strips showed narrow
complex waveforms.  A right femoral line was placed, and IV
fluids were hung with improvement in his BP.  During intubation,
large food particles were aspirated.  There was return to
spontaneous rhythm within 10 minutes.  A bedside echo during
code reportedly showed preserved LV function.  Pt was
transferrred to the CCU for further management.
.
He also underwent speech & swallow evaluation which showed
evidence of aspiration.  Per his wife, he is usually monitored
while eating but did have a hamburger today without supervision.
He reported to her not feeling well with neck pain, chest pain,
coughing and emesis after that meal. On further suctioning in
the ICU, he was found to have multiple pieces of hamburger in
his ET tube.
.
Unable to obtain ROS as pt intubated and sedated.

[**2192-11-26**] (admission): V-paced with underlying afib.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:[**2192-11-27**]  The left atrium is moderately
dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with apical hypokinesis (see cell 55). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There are filamentous
strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's
excresences (normal variant). There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened with moderate
tricuspid regurgitation (in the region of the pacer lead). There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
85yo M w/ AF s/p pacer in [**3-/2192**], dementia, HTN who presented
with BLE swelling, being diuresed with plan for cardiac cath
[**11-30**] who is now s/p PEA arrest with ROSC, likely related to
aspiration event with evolving sepsis and [**Last Name (un) **].
.
# s/p PEA arrest/Aspiration event: Pt was intubated during
arrest without difficulty and intially hemodynamically stable
with right femoral CVL in place, without pressor requirement.
Arrest most likely related to aspiration event earlier in day
given history of eating hamburger without supervision by wife,
difficulty breathing and general sense of not being well and
findings on ETT suction with large piece of hamburger in upper
airway and smaller pieces in lower airways. He was started on
Levofloxacin empirically for CAP given CXR findings prior to
aspiration. He was started on pressure support but became
tachypneic and ABG showed respiratory acidosis with pCO2>100. He
was changed to CMV with larger tidal volumes and acidosis
improved. FiO2 requirement fluctated between 60 and 100% and
secretions became darker and thicker. He was changed to
Meropenem (PCN allergy)/Vanco/Flagyl when patient began to rigor
and was hypothermic and hypotensive with SBPs down to the 50s.
Sedation was changed from propofol to fentanyl/versed and he was
bolused with a total of 5L normal sa
