History of Present Illness:
54 yo male with past medical history of Type 1 Diabetes
Mellitus, CAD, ESRD on HD, and alcohol abuse was admitted from
the ED after being found unresponsive and with a blood glucose
elevated to 1425.
.
He was reportedly found down at home surrounded by emesis and
small pools of fresh and old blood. He was brought to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] where his vital signs were HR 121, RR 22, BP 213/99, and

insulin gtt at 10 units per hour and received 1 gram ceftriaxone
IV x 1. He was intubated for airway protection and was then

96.9, HR 114, BP 164/86, RR 20, Pulse ox 100% vent. His NG tube
was notable for dark fluid residuals, although hemoccult was not
performed. He received 40mg IV pantoprazole, 1gram IV
vancomycin, flagyl 500mg IV, propofol, and midazolam. Per
report, he received approximately 4L NS between [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and

.
CXR [**10-19**]:
1.  Findings indicating underlying obstructive lung disease.
2.  ET tube and right IJ catheter in good position, NG tube
looped in the
stomach with its tip pointing towards the GE junction, which
should be
repositioned.
.
[**10-21**] TEE:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
.
CT Head [**10-22**]:
1.  No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage or abscess.
2.  Paranasal sinus opacification as described.
3.  Mild brain atrophy and evidence for prior microvascular
ischemia.
.
EGD [**10-24**]:
Esophagitis in the middle third of the esophagus, lower third of
the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction compatible with
severe reflux or [**Female First Name (un) **] (biopsy). Erythema in the duodenal bulb
and first part of the duodenum compatible with duodenitis.
Recommendations: Continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI x 2 weeks, then daily PPI
therapy. Reasonable to treat with fluconazole 200mg daily x 14
days for possible [**Female First Name (un) **], at least until path/micro results are
confirmed.
Patient should have eventual outpatient colonoscopy because over
50 yrs old and anemic.
.
Esophageal Biopsy:
Granulation tissue with fibrinopurulent exudate.
Scant detached squamous cells.
GMS stain is negative for fungal forms.
Multiple levels are examined.
.
MRI Head [**10-24**]:
No definite acute infarct.  Moderate brain atrophy and mild-to-
moderate changes of small vessel disease with left corona
radiata lacune.
Lacunes in the left thalamus.  Soft tissue changes in the
paranasal sinuses, which appear to be secondary to intubation.
.
CXR [**10-27**]:
The patient is extubated and the right internal jugular line is
removed in the meantime interval.  The right PICC line tip
terminates in mid low SVC.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable as well as post-sternotomy wires.  There is no hilar
enlargement.  Slight increase in interstitial markings,
especially in the perihilar and right lower lobe areas might
represent mild volume overload.  There is no pneumothorax or
sizable pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo M with DM, CAD, and ESRD on HD admitted with hyperosmolar
nonketotic state after being found unresponsive.
.
# Altered mental status.
Patient was admitted with poor mental status in the setting of
hyperglycemia.  Head CT and MRI were only significant for
chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  On [**10-26**], he was
extubated and his mental status appeared to be back at baseline
after discussing with his long-term dialysis nurse.  He remained
