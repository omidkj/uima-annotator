Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
OPCABGx3(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM,SVG-PDA)[**4-20**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68F with DM, CRI, CAD, CHF (EF 35%) initially
admitted to OSH with SOB who is transferred for cardiac
catheterization and stenting of her LAD.
.
Four days prior to her presentation at the OSH, the patient
presented to her PCP with complaints of dysuria and was
empirically started on Bactrim. She apparently was taking
naproxen at home prior to admission for hip pain. The day of
admission [**4-8**] she woke up, smoked a cigarette, and became
acutely short of breath. She did have a nonproductive cough. She
denied any associated chest discomfort, nausea, vomiting, or
palpitations. She did feel a little sweaty. She apparently had
been feeling well the day before, although had noticed increased
swelling in her legs and a 20lb weight gain over the previous
month for which she had received lasix intermittently. Has had
PND, no orthopnea. Has been taking her medications with
assistance of her daughters, but has not been compliant with low
sodium diet.
.
Her SOB worsened leading her to call 911. Upon EMS evaluation
she was tachycardic and tachypneic. She was administered
nitroglycerin, combivent, 80mg IV lasix, and morphine. She
apparently became nonresponsive and was intubated in the field
and brought to an OSH.
.
At the OSH, vitals on admission to the ICU were T 98.2 P 80 BP
156/74 O2 not recorded. ED vitals not included in transfer
paperwork. Per ICU admission note, patient had BP 240/110 at one
point but not at all clear when this occured.
Admission labs notable for ABG 7.22/53/466; K 6.5; BUN/Cr
50/3.1; WBC 21k (decreasing to 11k subsequently) and Hct 38.9.
Initial troponin was 0.02 rising to peak of 0.26 on [**4-9**]. EKG
done showed ST depressions and T wave inversions in
anterolateral leads. CXR reportedly c/w pulmonary edema. She was
admitted to the ICU and extubated on [**4-9**].
.
She underwent cardiac catheterization on [**4-13**] at the OSH which
was remarkable for 95% stenosis of the LAD after D2, 55-60%
stenosis of LCX with long tubular stenosis 60% after the large
OM, diffuse disease of the RCA with sequential moderate stenoses
with 85% mid RCA and 75% at takeoff of PLV. No interventions
were performed at time of cardiac catheterization. She was
loaded with plavix 600mg and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for stenting
of her LAD.
.
Here at [**Hospital1 18**], patient underwent repeat cardiac cath. Attempted
to access graft from right side was unsuccessful so catheter
introduced on left. Cath notable for 90% stenosis of the mid
LAD. The balloon could not be advanced across the lesion. As the
patient had CRI and had received 160cc of contrast already,
decision was made to abort the procedure.
.
On ROS: No history of thrombosis or PE, recent URI/flu, fevers,
chills, diarrhea/constipation, hematochezia, melena, or other
bleeding, claudication (had prior to vascular bypass surgery).
Had "small stroke" in past and subsequently underwent CEA.

Past Medical History:
* CAD
--told she had a "silent MI" at [**2-/2144**] admission
--persantine MIBI [**3-28**]
by report showed fixed defect distal anterolateral wall
* CHF
--TTE [**2-28**] at OSH showed EF 55% with apical akinesis, mild MR
and TR
* Diabetes w/ peripheral neuropathy HbA1c 7.1 [**2-28**]

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2144-4-25**] 4:20 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o inf, eff

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf, eff
EXAMINATION: PA and lateral chest.

INDICATION: Shortness of breath.

PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained on [**2144-4-25**] at 1622
hours and compared with the most recent radiograph of [**2144-4-22**].
Again is seen diffuse enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
consistent with cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.
Right-sided IJ line has been removed. There is a persistent
left-sided pleural effusion together with increased retrocardiac
density, which allowing for technical changes may have improved
since the prior radiograph. There appears to be a tiny
right-sided pleural effusion which is improved since the prior
study. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
