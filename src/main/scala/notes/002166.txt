Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for cardiac cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath with stenting
Endotracheal intubation
Cardioversion
Central Line placement


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with h/o anemia [**2-25**] angiodysplagia-related GI
bleed, h/o colon cancer, CAD s/p anterior MI [**2164-6-19**], resulting
in depressed EF (35%) who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] Hosp for cardiac catherization.
.
Recent relevant history:
Pt had an anterior MI on [**2164-6-19**] and was treated medically at
NEBH. She did not undergo cardiac catherization at that time.
TTE showed LVEF=35% with severe hypokinesis of the apex
infero-apically to antero-apically. There was akinesis of the
distal septum, about halfway to the apex, including the apex.
There was no AR, 2+ MR, 2+ TR, with PA pressures between 70 and
75mmHg.
.
Pt was d/c'd to a cardiac rehab where she had persistant chest
discomfort, SOB, palpitations with nausea, and was re-admitted
to [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation on [**2164-6-28**]. There, MI was ruled out
by cardiac enzymes and pt's symptoms were determined to be
likely related to mild CHF along with anxiety. Pt was diuresed,
then sent back to rehab with medication adjustments.
Back at the rehab, patient continued to have vomitting, chest
tightness, and LUQ pain, and pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 7872**] on [**2164-7-3**]. Again, she was ruled out for MI by EKG and
cardiac enzymes. Persantine stress test, which did not reproduce
her pain, showed mostly fixed anterior infarct with mild lateral
peri-infarct edema, no ischemia. She was D/C'd to rehab with a
diagnosis of non-cardiac chest pain likely d/t GERD.
.
About one week later, on [**7-19**], she experienced similar symptoms,
partially relieved by SL Nitro. She went to her scheduled follow
up appointments with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11679**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (GI), and during
it she was found to have a her hct=26, and troponin=0.62 with
equivocal EKG changes. She was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for
transfusion, but after 1 unit of pRBCs, she developed acute
congestive heart failure. She was diuresed with Lasix 80 IV,
given Nitro paste, and, after these treatments, became
hypotensive to 79/33. Dopamine was started. Cardiac enzymes
revealed trop 2.96 and CK 170 (MB not done). Decision was made
to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management/
catherization. Of note, her WBC also increased to 15.2, and
started on empiric Levaquin.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt admitted to CCU team. [**Name (NI) 47025**], pt was
without complaints. She was taken to cath lab, where a near
total occlusion of proximal/ostial LAD was found along with a
Lcx 90% lesion (Lcx dominant vessel). The LCx lesion was
approached first. While intervening on the LCx lesion, the
patient became hypotensive--likely from occluding the dominant
LCx, causing decreased flow to LAD. WIth the hypotension, she
also became nauseous and vomitted (?aspirated). She then became
asystolic. CPR was initiated as the procedure continued. The LAD
lesion was stented with good resultant flow and the LCx lesion
was angioplastied (with resultant dissection). During this, the
patient was intubated and started on levophed and dopamine. She
went into a wide complex tachycardia--VT vs. SVT/sinus tach w/
incomplete RBBB. She was started on lidocaine gtt and given
300mg Amio bolus. At the time of transfer to the CCU, the
patient's ABG was 7.04/36/436 and lactate 6.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was still vented. Her blood
pressure dropped into the 50s shortly after her arrival. After
getting 2amps of bicarb, BP improved to SBP 90-100s. A-line
placement was attempted unsuccessfully (with doppler in b/l
radial vessels). A right femoral venous catheter was placed. Of
note, pt had bloody NGT drainage.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for current absence of
dyspnea on exertion, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope. (Prior
to cath)

until her MI in [**2164-5-24**]. Since her MI, she has been in rehab.

There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2164-7-23**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the mid inferolateral wall and distal inferio
wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %).
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild-moderate aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of CAD. Mild-moderate
aortic valve stenosis. At least mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
