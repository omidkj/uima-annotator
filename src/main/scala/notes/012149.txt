History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is an 89 year old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation not on coumadin, CHF (EF 50-55%), moderate AS who
was initially admitted to neurosurgery on [**2132-6-9**] for L subdural
hemorrhage after a fall. CT showed subfalcine herniation and
developing uncal herniation. She underwent evacuation of SDH on
[**2132-6-9**]. [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be lethargic but MRI
brain was negative for stroke. Hospital course was remarkable
for hypernatremia to 147 managed with free water boluses and
slow recovery. Post-operatively, the patient was transferred to
neurosurg step down where she has remained on 50% VM. The
patient has had persistent leukocytosis since admission.
Geriatrics consulted and started Levaquin on [**6-17**]. UA negative.
CXR c/w CHF. She was noted to be grossly positive with weight of
128 (up from baseline of 111 on [**2132-5-22**] in the clinic) and was
started on Lasix boluses for diuresis.
.
On [**2132-6-18**], patient developed new seizure which resolved with
Ativan 2 mg IV once. She then was noted to be tachypneic with
altered mental status (less responsive) and MICU team was
called. CT head w/o change. When seen on the floor, the patient
was minimally responsive breathing at rates 38-45. HR 80, BP
100-110/50s, O2 sat 92-93% on 50% face mask. Upper airway
rhoncor and diffuse rales on exam. CXR with pleural effusions
and worsening CHF. ABG with pH 7.48 pCO2 34 pO2 79 HCO3 26; WBC
18; Lactate: 1.7.

Pertinent Results:
RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report
([**2132-6-9**]) CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  10:15 AM
FINDINGS: There has been a left frontoparietal craniotomy. There
has been evacuation of majority of the large subdural hematoma.
A tiny amount of residual remains. New from the prior
examination, there is hypoattenuation in the left frontal lobe
with a 1.5-cm area of intraparenchymal frontal lobe hemorrhage.
There is 8 mm of rightward midline shift/subfalcine herniation
on this study. There is an unchanged lacune within the posterior
limb of the left internal capsule. The right frontal subgaleal
hematoma remains present.
IMPRESSION: Evacuation of majority of the blood contained within
left subdural hematoma. Slight improvement in the rightward
midline shift.
New intraparenchymal left frontal lobe hemorrhage and
hypodensity. This could relate to underlying hemorrhage into an
anterior cerebral artery infarct or other less likely etiologies
such as contusions. These findings were telephoned to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of dictation.

([**2132-6-9**]) CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST
CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE: There is no evidence of fracture or
dislocation. No prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Multilevel
degenerative changes are seen including posterior disc
protrusions at C3-4 and C4-5 as well as calcification of the
ligamentum flavum at C5-6 and C6-7 causing mild canal stenosis
at these levels. No significant cord compression or neural
foraminal narrowing. Vertebral body heights are maintained. A
well corticated osteophyte is noted off the superior aspect of
the anterior arch of C1. Ground glass opacities and septal
thickening in the lung apices suggest pulmonary edema.
Dystrophic calcifications as well as a large concentric
calcification with hypodense center are seen within the thyroid
gland.
Large nuchal ligament calcifications are present.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
2. Moderate degenerative changes of the cervical spine as noted
above.
3. Pulmonary edema at the lung apices. Clinical evaluation is
recommended as well as chest radiographs if clinically
indicated.
4. Dystrophic calcifications in the thyroid gland. The gland
could be further evaluated by ultrasound on a nonemergent basis.

([**2132-6-9**]) CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: The left convexity acute subdural hemorrhage has
increased significantly in size, from a maximal dimension of 7
mm to now measuring 19 mm. There is significant sulcal
effacement and mass effect. Rightward subfalcine herniation has
increased from 4 mm to 10 mm. The right ventricle is compressed.
Uncal herniation is developing. Large right frontal subgaleal
hematoma is unchanged. No fractures are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Increasing acute left subdural hematoma with significant mass
effect and subfalcine herniation. Uncal herniation is developing
and urgent neurosurgical consult is recommended.
2. Right frontal subgaleal hematoma is redemonstrated.

([**2132-6-11**]) MRI with DWI = IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarction. Areas of hypoattenuation
noted on recent CT examination correspond to edema likely from
evolving contusions within the left frontal lobe. Mild amount of
surrounding mass effect with no significant shift of midline
structures.
2. Large amount of motion artifact degrading the MRA makes it
virtually uninterpretable for evaluation of aneurysms or
definite atherosclerotic disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: 89 yo female with AF, CHF, MR, TR, moderate AS, s/p SDH
evacuation on [**2132-6-9**] who was transferred to the MICU for
respiratory distress, with leukocytosis, hypotension, s/p
seizure. At the time of discharge, she was actively being
treated for known MSSA ventilator-associated pneumonia.
.
Sub-dural hemorrhage/mental status: The patient was admitted
through the emergency department after CT scan revealed a left
SDH.  The patient was taken to the OR emergently after the SDH
increased in size.  Pt underwent left craniotomy for evacuation
of hematoma
