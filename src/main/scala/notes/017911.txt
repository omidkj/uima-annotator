Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for GI bleed, stroke and PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
transesophageal echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old woman with seizure disorder and unclear
h/o CAD, and unclear h/o CVA who presented to OSH on [**5-1**] with
painless BRBPR x 1 week. Gastroenterology w/u there thought the
bleed could be from NSAIDs which she takes for back pain and
aspirin. However, EGD and colonoscopy did not reveal a source of
bleed. She was admitted with a hemaglobin of 8.5 and recieved 2
units of PRBC and stabilized to a hemaglobin of 9.7 before
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Her course at OSH was complicated by neurologic findings. On
[**5-2**], she was noticed to have a left facial droop and expressive
aphasia. MRI of the head showed a small acute infarct in the
left peritrigonal redion. Neurology was consulted and did not
think the small area of infarct in that area could explain her
word finding difficulties and thought his could be more from
enchephalopathy rather than an aphasic disorder.
.
On [**5-2**], she also desaturated to 60% and cardiac enzymes were
cycled. They were elevated and cardiology consult was called.
EKG was "unintepretable due to LBBB" and an echo as done. Echo
showed normal LV function but significant RV strain and RV
overload with pulm htn. V/Q scan is high probability for large
burden of bilateral PE's involving the segmental and
subsegmental areas.
.
Given her GIB of unknown source and large burden of PE,
anticogulation was an issue and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.
.
Currently, she has expressive aphasia which makes taking her
history difficult. She currently complaints of RUQ/R Rib pain.
At OSH, she had unremarkable RUQ and KUB.
.
She denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
.
At OSH, vitals before transfer: 9736, 136/81, 80, 16, 92% on
4LNC.

At OSH:
# VQ scan shows high probability of PE with evidence of multiple
segmental and subsegmental defects throughout both lungs with
the largest being posterior in the right lower lobe as well as
superiory in the left upper lobe.
# MRI brain: Acute small infarct in the left peritrigonal region
and also small vessel changes
# Echo: NL LV function. Right ventricular pressure overload with
mildly reduced RV function and severe pulm htn.
.
Radiology:
[**5-9**]: CT A Chest:
1. Atherosclerotic aorta without evidence of dissection or
aneurysmal dilatation.
2. Findings consistent with mild volume overload.
3. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes and single enlarged
paratracheal node are likely reactive. However, follow-up chest
CT is recommended following resolution of acute symptoms to
exclude the possibility of neoplasm.
4. Small pericardial effusion.
5. Axial hiatal hernia.
6. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
.
[**5-9**] CT Chest abd pelvis without IV contrast:
1. Diffuse ground-glass opacities, which are nonspecific and
likely represent pulmonary edema and less likely infection.
2. Moderate-sized pericardial effusion.
3. Large hiatus hernia and intrathoracic location of the
stomach.
4. Pleural plaques indicating prior asbestos exposure.
.
[**5-9**]: Echo:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with
normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal
(LVEF>55%), without regional wall motion abnormalities. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small posterior pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion. Moderate LVH with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction with evidence of elevated right and
left-sided filling pressures. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old female with GIB from unknown source, large PE burden
and acute stroke at OSH. She was on the floor for one night then
became hypotensive. Transferred to the MICU on [**5-9**]. received 2L
IVF. Noted to have differences in right and leg arm BPs. CTA was
ordered which showed no dissection. She was stabilized and
returned to the floor on [**5-10**].  Remainder of hospital course by
problem:
.
# GI Bleed: Possibly from her outpatient aspirin and NSAID use.
She had been using NSAIDS for her back pain since [**Month (only) 956**]. EGD
at OSH: hiatal hernia, no bleed. Colonoscopy at OSH:
diverticulosis, no obvious source of bleed.  We placed 2 large
[**Last Name (un) **] IVs and monitored her Hct closely.  It trended down with
IVF in the setting of hypotension but stabilized.  We treated
with a PPI.  The Hct remained stable over the hospital course.
.
# PE: At OSH: VQ scan shows high probability of PE with evidence
of multiple segmental and subsegmental defects.  She was stable
on 3-4L NC.  We treated with heparin gtt and started coumadin.
She had a therapeutic INR on coumadin dose of 5 mg QHS. She will
need her INR checked every week and adjust the coumadin dose
accordingly.
.
# CVA: OSH MRI showed small acute infarct in left peritrigonal
region of less than 1cm.  Neuro was consulted.  Given the small
area of the infarct, we anticoagulated as above.  She initially
was quite aphasic with a left eyelid droop.  These symptoms
improved substantially during her stay.  She was able to speak
coherently and act appropriately.  She was alert and oriented
x3, able to move all extremities, and interact appropriately.
The carotid US showed L sided subclavian steal. Neuro was made
aware of this. This issue will need to be addressed at her
coming neuro appointment. She will follow up with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 72861**] in neuro clinic at the [**Hospital1 **].
.
# ARF: The patient came in with creatinine of 1.5 (it had been
up to 1.9 at OSH).  On [**5-11**] it increased to 2.7 rather acutely
