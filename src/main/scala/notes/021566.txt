Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed

leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
The LV has moderate systolic dysfxn of the mid and distal walls
globally. Basal segments function well.

Post- LIMA-LAD: Patient is in NSR with no pressors or inotropes
running.
Improved LV systolic fxn. EF now 45 - 50%. Trace MR, Trace AI.
Aorta intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
