Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old female
with known coronary artery disease.  She presented to [**Hospital3 6265**] Emergency Room on [**2191-10-10**] with chest pain
and shortness of breath.  The patient experienced progressive
shortness of breath and hypoxia and required intubation.
Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.  The patient was admitted
to the Coronary Care Unit and treated for congestive heart
failure with Lasix and Nitroglycerin.  On hospital day #2 the
patient ruled in for myocardial infarction by enzymes.  The
patient experienced a ventricular fibrillation arrest, was
cardioverted times one to sinus rhythm and was transferred to
[**Hospital6 256**] for cardiac
catheterization.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial physical examination revealed
the patient to be intubated.  Carotids were without bruits.
Lungs were clear.  Heart regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen
markedly obese.  Extremities warm and well perfused.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory.  Results of the cardiac
catheterization were a 95% left main lesion, moderate left
anterior descending disease, 100% obtuse marginal lesion,
100% right coronary artery lesion.  The patient was given an
intra-aortic balloon pump and emergently taken to the
Operating Room for a coronary artery bypass graft times three
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal,
supraventricular tachycardia to posterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending.  The
patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition on a Neosynephrine drip, Milrinone drip,
intra-aortic balloon pump 1:1.  Intraoperative
transesophageal echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
45% with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, mild to
moderate tricuspid regurgitation and mild aortic
insufficiency.  In the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative
day #1 the patient was continued on her inotropic support.
The patient was started on an Amiodarone infusion for atrial
fibrillation prophylaxis.  FVO2 was monitored due to the
patient's tricuspid regurgitation.  The patient required a
moderate amount of volume resuscitation.  On postoperative
day #2 the patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response and converted to normal sinus rhythm
with Lopressor and Amiodarone boluses.  The Milrinone
infusion was attempted to be weaned off and was restarted
secondary to a decrease in the cardiac index.  The patient
continued to experience periods of atrial fibrillation.  On
postoperative day #3 the intra-aortic balloon pump was
removed.  The patient was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventilation and continued to have problems with
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The
Milrinone infusion was weaned to off on postoperative day #3.
The patient was noted to have a decrease in her platelet
count to 81,000.  A heparin antibody panel was sent which was
subsequently negative.  The patient required an insulin
infusion for control of her blood sugars.  On postoperative
day #4 the patient required increased pulmonary toilet and
nebulizer treatments for increased secretions and wheezing.
On postoperative day #5 the patient was noted to have a
elevated white blood cell count to 21,000 which rose to
25,000 on postoperative day #6.  The patient was pancultured
at that time.  On postoperative day #6 the patient
experienced increasing respiratory distress with shortness of
breath and hypoxia.  The patient was reintubated.
Bronchoscopy was performed at the time of reintubation which
was essentially clear with scant loose secretions.  Shortly
after the bronchoscopy was performed the patient
self-extubated and required emergent reintubation due to
decreased oxygen saturation.  Also on postoperative day #6
the patient again experienced problems with atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  After being
reintubated the patient was cardioverted times one into sinus
rhythm.  Chest x-ray done after reintubation showed a right
pleural effusion for which a chest tube was placed with 600
cc of serosanguinous fluid.  The patient's cultures from
postoperative day #6 had multiple organisms.  Urine culture
was positive for Klebsiella.  Sputum culture was positive for
Hemophilus influenza beta lactamase positive.  Blood cultures
were positive for Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus, Hemophilus influenza as well as coagulase negative
Staphylococcus.  The patient was started on Levaquin for the
urinary tract infection and was subsequently started on
Vancomycin for the coagulase positive Staphylococcus in her
blood.  On postoperative day #7 the patient required
intravenous Diltiazem infusion to control the ventricular
rate of her atrial fibrillation.  Postoperative day #8 the
patient self-extubated again and again was emergently
reintubated due to decreased oxygen saturation and was
reintubated.  White blood cell count was noted to be elevated
and due to the positive blood cultures a new central line was
placed.  The patient required cardioversion again on
postoperative day #8 and cardioverted to a junctional rhythm.
The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit for diuresis
with Lasix and Diamox and slow ventilatory wean, antibiotic
therapy.  On [**10-21**], postoperative day #10 the patient
was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation.  Her
chest tube was removed on postoperative day #11.  The patient
required aggressive pulmonary toilet and nebulizer treatments
for secretions and wheezing.  The patient was started on a
heparin drip to anticoagulate her for her recurrent atrial
fibrillation.  On [**10-25**], postoperative day #14, the
patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the
floor.  On [**10-26**], the patient underwent
electrophysiology study for her preoperative history of
ventricular fibrillation.  The study was negative for
inducible ventricular tachycardia and the arrhythmia service
recommended continuing the Amiodarone for the history of
atrial fibrillation.  The patient had remained in sinus
rhythm for over 72 hours continuing on her heparin drip.
After her electrophysiology study the patient was started on
Coumadin therapy.  The patient is currently awaiting bed
availability in a rehabilitation facility.  The patient is
awaiting a PICC line placement for continued oxacillin for
her Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia
for a total of 14 days and the patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation in stable condition.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum is 98.4, pulse
76 in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 118/60, oxygen saturation
on 2 liters of nasal cannula is 98%.  Weight is 107.4 kg
which is 1 kg less than her admission weight.  Blood sugars
on insulin sliding scale are 150s to 200s.  The patient is
neurologically intact.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and
rhythm without rub or murmur.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused.  Respiratory, lungs with coarse breathsounds
bilaterally with minimal secretions, good cough effort, now
requiring only as needed nebulizer treatments.  Abdomen is
large, positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.  The
patient has 2 to 3+ peripheral edema.
