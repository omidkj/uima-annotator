Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old male with a history of type II diabetes, parkinson's
and dementia who presents with bibasilar pneumonia and sepsis.

Sepsis/Pneumonia: He required intubation for aspiration during
line placement and airway protection. He was initially admitted
to the ICU where he also required pressors to mantain his blood
pressure. His infection was complicated by severe dehydration
and hypernatremia. Lactate initailly 9.0 but responded to fluids
and retured to normal range. Urine legionella Ag negative.
Endotracheal sputum cultures with coag+ staph. Also [**11-21**] blood
cultures from ED presentation were positive for GPC in cluster.
He initially was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl
for empiric coverage. These were tailored down to vancomycin (14
day course; received 4 doses in hospital) and levofloxacin (7
day course). Extubated and transitioned off pressors within 24
hours of ICU admission and subsequently was transfered to the
medical wards for further management.

Hypernatremia: On presentation patient had a severely elevated
serum sodium of 174 and appeared dehydrated.  Estimated free
water deficit on presentation was approximately 8 liters.  He
was treated with aggressive hydration and his serum sodium
improved to 145.

Acute Renal Failure:  On presentation patient's creatinine was
1.8 from a baseline of 0.8.  This resolved after IV hydration.

Type II Diabetes:  On presentation the patient had elevated
blood sugars in the 300s, likely related to his systemic
infection.  He takes metformin and glyburide at his nursing
home.  These were held on admission and he transiently required
an insulin drip in the setting of receiving dextrose containing
fluids.  He was subsequently transitioned to an insulin sliding
scale.

Parkinsons/Dementia:  Was tremulous on presentation but without
significant rigidity.  His medications initially were held in
the setting of being NPO but these were restarted after NGT was
placed.  On presentation he was somnolent.  After extubation his
mental status slowly improved and he was able to converse
appropriately with continued agitation.  He was unable to
cooperate with speech and swallow evaluation and an NGT was
placed for nutrition and hydration as well as for his
medications (sinemet, namenda, aricept).  His aspiration risk
will need to be readdressed on the floor.

Rhabdomyolysis: On presentation he was noted to have an elevated
CK. The exact etiology for this is unclear, but suspect that it
may have been related to dehydration and/or muscle injury in the
setting of his neurologic disease and motility limitations. This
improved with IVF.

Glaucoma: He was continued on his home eye drops.

Nutrition: As noted he was intubated and after extubation he
failed swallow testing. This required placement of NGT in order
to administer medications. Subsequent evaluation by speech and
swallow indicated that the patient was able to swallow and the
NGT was removed.

Access: He is being discharged with a PICC line for IV
vancomycin administration. This should be discontinued upon
completion of two week vancomycin course.
