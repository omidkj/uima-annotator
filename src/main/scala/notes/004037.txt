Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, LAD occlusion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 89610**] is a 54 year old male with a history of HTN,
HLD, OSA who presented to an OSH on [**4-15**] with intermittant chest
pain, dyspnea, new LE edema, and back pain ongoing for 3 days.
His symptoms occured with both rest and activity.  He had seen
his PCP earlier in the day for these symptoms and was told that
he likely had a heart attack based on EKG.  Troponin peaked at
0.138.  ECHO at OSH was notable for new CHF with EF of 25-30%.
He also had a new cough and CXR that showed pneumonia vs.
atelectasis in the LLL.  He was afebrile and started on
ceftriaxone and also given lasix.  His cough subsequently
resolved.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization and further management.
.
Cardiac catheterization showed 100% occlusion of the LAD that
after multiple wire passes was eventually opened with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2
with good distal flow.  He also had a 70% RCA lesion that was
not intervened upon.  He received a total of 410 cc of contrast
and had an angioseal placed in the right groin.  On arrival to
the CCU he was chest pain free.
.
On review of systems, he notes recent cough, now resolved.  He
had a single episode of syncope a couple of years ago of unclear
etiology.  He has chronic back pain and left shoulder pain.  He
denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for the presence of chest
pain, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and new ankle edema.
These symptoms have all improved since receiving lasix.  He has
one prior episode of syncope two years ago, but none since.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89610**] is a 54 year old male with a history of HTN, HLD,
OSA who presented to an OSH with chest pain, dyspnea, cough new
LE edema, found to have acute CHF with an EF 25-30% and CAD now
s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to the LAD.
.
# CORONARIES:  Patient has no prior history of CAD, but old EKG
had changes concerning for MI in the past with no intervention
at that time.  EKG is consistent with LAD lesion, however, the
overall pattern is very similar to an EKG from last [**Month (only) 1096**]
that also had Q waves.  Had 100% LAD occlusion and 70% mid RCA
lesion on cath with elevated troponins.  Now s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to the
LAD.  No evidence of diabetes on OSH labs.  Pt was started on
aspirin, plavix, and metoprolol. Lisinopril restarted in the am
.
# PUMP:  New acute CHF with EF 25-30% per OSH discharge summary.
 New cough, dyspnea, and lower extremity edema prior to
presentation are all consistent with acute CHF.  PAtient
received additional 20mg IV lasix. He will be getting a TTE as
outpatient
.
# RHYTHM:  No evidence of arrhythmias
.
# Cough and Dyspnea: Resolved.  Question of pneumonia vs.
atelectasis on OSH CXR for which he received ceftriaxone.
Patient afebrile and no other signs or symptoms of infection and
WBC count never elevated.  Suspect cough and dyspnea were
related to acute CHF and not infectious process. Antibiotics
were not restarted during the hospitalization.
.
# Hypertension: Not on medical therapy at home. Metoprolol and
lisinopril started in the am after cath,
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Not on medical therapy at home. Started on
Atorvastatin 80mg daily

# OSA: Uses nasal CPAP at home.  Consulted respiratory for CPAP
in hospital.  Pt continued to use CPAP in the hospital and will
continue it in the outpatient setting.
.
# GERD: Started Ranitidine 150mg PO BID
.
