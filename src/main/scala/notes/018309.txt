Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
56F w ESRD on PD last HD 3 days PTA ([**2129-1-12**]), history of
recurrent C. difficile infection currently on Flagyl and
Vancomycin taper discharged on [**2129-1-6**], whose friends
called EMS today after friends called them because the patient
hadn't contact[**Name (NI) **] them in a few days and she was found to be
slightly altered.  She was brought to the ED where she was found
to have continued abdominal pain. She reports that her pain is
described as an [**7-4**] crampy nonradiating pain located across the
epigastrium that has not associations with food and is relieved
with psin medications.  She reports that her BMs have increased
from ~4/day to ~7 loose, watery copius, nonbloody BMs.  When she
was initially admitted on [**2129-1-6**] she reports having 24BMs per
day.  This abdominal pain was associated with lightheadedness,
dizziness but no syncope. She denies any chest pain or
palpiations.  She denies fevers. She does, however, report that
she's SOB with DOE with increasing leg swelling, but no increase
in orthopnea or PND.  As above her last HD was 3 days PTA.
.
In the ED her vitals: 99.2 72/45 56.  The hypotension (72/45)
was refractory to NS boluses thus requiring Levophed and R
femoral line placement.  She had a leuckocytosis with left shift
and CT abdomen with evidence of colitis.  Patient also had a
negative Head CT.  She was given Dextrose for hypoglycemia,
cultures taken, and she was given Vanc/Zosyn empirically.

CT HEAD:
CONCLUSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Small focus of heterotopic [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter as described above,
present on
multiple prior examinations.
3. Prominence of the retropharyngeal soft tissues, although was
seen on the prior CT, warrants direct visual inspection.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for megacolon.
2. Extremely limited study due to suboptimal contrast phase and
paucity of
mesenteric fat and lack of oral contrast.
3. Mild colonic wall thickening could be seen in the setting of
colitis or
bowel wall edema in the setting of peritoneal dialysis.
4. Chest wall collaterals and suboptimal contrast phase raised
the
possibility of [**Doctor Last Name 17911**] stenosis/occlusion versus sequlae of surgical
A/V dialysis fistula.
.
CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral bibasilar consolidation, right greater than
left.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Cardiomegaly.
.
CXR ([**1-21**]):
REASON FOR EXAM: Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
Comparison is made with prior studies including 2/24,25,26/[**2128**].

There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities have improved
markedly on the right. Small right pleural effusion is
unchanged. Cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
In short, Ms [**Known lastname 1391**] is a 56F w multiple medical problems,
notably HTN, ESRD (on PD), [**Name (NI) 17911**] clot (on home Coumadin), and
recent admission w recurrent C. difficile colitis (on [**Doctor Last Name **]/vanc
PO), who was originally admitted to the MICU w altered mental
status, hypotension in the setting of worsened diarrhea. She was
found to be in respiratory failure from a pneumonia requiring
mechanical ventilation, was treated with Vanc/Zosyn x 7 days
(completed), Levofloxacin x 14 days (through [**1-30**]) and fluids.
She was also on norepinephrine drip temporarily for pressure
support. She was then transferred to medicine for further
treatment.

# Pneumonia:  Patient presented with septic physiology,
initially with unclear source. In the ICU, patient was started
on Levophed gtt for BP support.  She was treated empirically
with broad-spectrum coverage with Vancomycin and Zosyn at time
of admission.  On [**1-17**], patient was intubated due to acute
respiratory decompensation.  A CT chest revealed bilateral
infiltrates.  Levofloxacin was added for double-coverage of a
hospital-acquired pneumonia, both due to worsening respiratory
status and radiographic worsening of right-sided pulmonary
infiltrate.  Subsequently, her leukocytosis began to resolved,
and respiratory status gradually improved.  Sputum sample was
unrevealing, and legionella testing was negative.  On [**1-19**], she
successfully underwent at trial of PS at 5/5, but was found to
have no cuff leak.  Given concerns for laryngeal edema due to
her facial edema (underlying [**Month/Year (2) 17911**] syndrome), she was treated per
protocol with Decadron 5 mg q 6 hours x 24 hours.  She was
successfully extubated with Anesthesia at bedside on [**1-20**].
Vancomycin and zosyn were continued for 7-day day  course.  Plan
is to complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin given suspicion
for atypical infection.

# Hypotension:  Patient was maintained on Levophed gtt with goal
MAP > 60.  Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated, secondary to
demand from ESRD.  An urgent TTE on night of admission showed no
evidence of tamponade.  Levophed was weaned on [**1-20**], and
subsequent BP's were in the high 70's systolic with MAPs > 60.
Cortisol stim (12 -> 22) ruled out adrenal insufficiency.
Septic physiology was treated as above.  All culture data were
unrevealing.  She received a dose of IV albumin 25 grams without
improvement of BP.

# Recurrent C. diff infection:  Patient has documented history
of recurrent c. d
