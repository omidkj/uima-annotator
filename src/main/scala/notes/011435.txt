Found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extubated [**2100-10-21**] (was intubated at outside hospital)

History of Present Illness:
50-year-old male with history of bipolar disorder and asthma who
was found down by his roommate.  Per EMS, roommate raised
suspicion of overdose on sleeping pills.  He was brought to an
OSH where he was given 1mg narcan with minimal benefit.  He was
subsequently intubated as he was unresponsive and snoring
deeply. He had head CT that showed "diffuse loss of grey/white
matter consistent with global hypoxic ischemia."  Initial ABG
was 7.18/68/482/25.  WBC 19 at OSH.  Tox screen at OSH was
negative.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where initial VS were: 98.4  79
111/77 20 100%.  Per neurology notes, his sedation was lightened
at the ED and he was noted to have strong purposeful movements
and became very agitated.  OG tube drained maroon colored
substances.  He was trace guaiac positive on rectal exam.  She
was bolused with PPI and started on a drip. Repeat head CT w/o
contrast showed no acute intracranial process.  CTA neck showed
no dissection of the carotid/vertebral arteries.  CT chest
showed no acute injury and nodular ground glass opacities in
right upper and lower lobes.

RADIOLOGY
[**2100-10-21**] EEG
This is an abnormal EEG due to intermittent, moderate amplitude
generalized bursts of delta waves with no associated
epileptiform discharges. The background activity is also slow in
theta frequency. These findings are suggestive of mild to
moderate encephalopathy. There are no focal abnormalities or
epileptiform discharges.

[**2100-10-21**] CXR
Endotracheal tube high in position, terminating approximately
8.5
cm above the level of the carina and should be repositioned.
The nasogastric tube is also high in position, terminating in
the expected location of the mid esophagus, as above.  The above
findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 426**] on [**2100-10-21**]
immediately after the study was read, at approximately 3:18 p.m.
 At that point, the patient had been extubated.

[**2100-10-21**] CT HEAD
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
2. Old right medial orbital blow out fracture.

[**2100-10-21**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS
1. No acute injury to the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
2. Nodular ground glass opacity in the right upper and lower
lobes are likely
inflammatory, possible due to aspiration, much less likely
contusions or
malignancy. Non-urgent (outpatient) followup CT after completion
of acute
treatment is recommedended to assure resolution.

[**2100-10-21**] CTA  HEAD AND NECK
No evidence of vascular dissection, stenosis, or occlusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
50-year-old male with history of bipolar disorder and asthma who
was found down by his roommate.

# Heroin Overdose: the patient was found not responsive, he was
extubated the morning after his admission. He was very agtitated
for the day following his extubation, and his symptoms were
possibly consistent with withdrawal, either from opioids or from
alcohol. The patient's delirium cleared and he endorsed
overdosing on heroin. Psychiatry assessment cleared him from
Section 12, as he consistently denied SI and the patient was
oriented x3. The patient was going to be discharged but he left
before he received his paperwork, so he left AMA.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely due to heroin overdose
causing decreased respiratory drive.  [**Month (only) 116**] also have aspiration
pneumonia vs pneumonitis contributing to respiratory failure.

# Cerebral edema: CT head at OSH reportedly showing diffuse loss
of grey/white matter consistent with global hypoxic ischemia.
Repeat CT head here did not show acute process.  The patient was
recommended to get MRI but was too agitated to obtain one and
then was ready for discharge but left AMA.

# Coffee ground emesis: Pt reportedly had coffee ground emesis
and had trace guaiac positive stools at OSH.  On exam at ICU, OG
tube output is gastro-occult negative and never had recurrence.


# Leukocytosis: WBC elevated to 17 on initiation, this resolved.
Likely due to hemoconcentration as Hct is elevated to 50.

# Bipolar disorder: per psychiatry, should resume home
medications at time of discharge. Patient denied SI or
intentional overdose.
