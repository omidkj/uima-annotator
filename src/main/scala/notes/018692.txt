Brief Hospital Course:
Arrived at ED at 15:00. Initial vitals were 175/66, 71, 16,
100%. GCS 3. Pupils unequal, reactive initially. Seen by acute
stroke team member at 15:15. CT ordered by 15:15. CT with large
left thalamic hemorrhage. Not a candidate for IV-tPA. Intubated
after Vecuronium, Etomidate, Succhinylcholine. Loaded with 1
gram Dilantin. Received 70 grams of Mannitol. OGT and A-line
placed in ED. Started on Nitroprusside for goal SBP 120-140. He
was then admitted to the ICU for continued management.
1.  NEURO:
Because of ventricular extension of bleed and impending
obstruction of the 3rd ventricle, a vent drain was placed by
neurosurgery on [**10-30**].  He was given cefazolin while the drain
was in place. Initial ICPs were in the 20's.  He was given
factor VII.  To prevent hydrocephalus, he was given
intraventricular t-PA.  He was also treated with mannitol.  Rpt
CT scans showed decrease in intraventricular blood.  On [**11-3**] he
was noted to have rhythmic shaking activity of the right upper
extremity.  He was tx'd with ativan and re-loaded with dilantin.
 Seizure activity resolved. Neurologically, he remained stable
and showed some signs of improvement, with spontaneous movement
of his left upper and lower extremities, and intermittent
following of basic commands. On [**2198-11-5**], ventricular drain was
d/c'ed. Cefazolin was maintained. On [**11-10**], the patient showed
decreased responsiveness (eyes not opening to voice, no response
to command - had previously held up 2 fingers). A head CT showed
interval decrease in hemorrhage and surrounding edema, and
decrease in traventricular blood. Dilantin level was 10.9 and
the patient was given 500mg IV dilantin. CXR showed no new
infiltrate.
On [**2198-11-11**], the patient was transferred to the floor.
Neurological exam was stable after transfer to floor. Dilantin
level was sub-therapeutic on [**11-14**] and t was given an additional
200mg po and dose was increased from 200/100/200 to 200/130/200.
Please follow up dilantin level this week and adjust dose to
maintain corrected level 15-17.

2. PULMONARY:
The patient was intubated on admission and extubated without
complication on [**2198-11-9**]. CXR on [**2198-11-5**] showed a focal opacity
in right upper lobe centrally. He was pancultured and begun on
levoflox on [**2198-11-6**]. Flagyl was added on [**11-7**] for presumed
aspiration PNA, then d/c'ed after 3d. CXR on 113/04 showed no
infiltrate.  On the floor, the patient again had a T to 101.2 on
111/04 and was pancultured. CXR showed no infiltrate, but pt was
continued on levo and flagyl was started on [**11-12**].
The patient had significant secretions throughout his hospital
course and required significant suctioning, approximately q2
hours.
On [**11-15**], the pt's low grade temps resolved and he required less
frequent suctioning.
On [**11-15**], tracheostomy was discussed with the patient's mother as
a means of controlling his secretions and preventing mucous
plugging in the future. On [**2198-11-16**], trach was placed by thoracic
surgery service without complication.

3. CV:
Pt was started on Nitroprusside initially to maintain SBP
120-140, and was later changed to labetalol with goal SBP
140-160.  He ruled out for MI. On [**2198-11-9**], his lopressor was
increased and he was started on lisinopril and HCTZ for elevated
BP's. From [**11-12**] to [**11-15**], his SBP was 140's-150's. On [**11-15**], his
hydral was increased to maximum dose, with good effect.
A lipid panel was done (TG 160, HDL 35, LDL 78), and the patient
was placed on lipitor 10mg qd.
He was maintained on telemetry in the step-down unit (for
nursing purposes) and no events were seen.

4. ID:
PNA as described above.
On [**2198-11-12**], after T spike, the pt had 2/4 bottles with coag
negative Staph. He wa given one dose of vanc on [**11-13**], but as
[**11-13**] surveillance cultures were negative and he did not spike
again, these were considered to be contamination.
On [**2198-11-15**], the pt's low grade temps resolved.
He was maintained on a 14d course of levo and flagyl (started
[**11-7**]). He has remained afebrile and WBC decreasing.  Will
finish 14 day course of flagyl in 3 days.

5. GI: Pt was fed by NGT and then by PEG, placed [**11-6**].
Tolerated feeds without difficulty.
.
6. Endo: The patient was initially placed on an insulin gtt, and
prior to transfer to the step-down, was placed on NPH and RISS.
NPH was titrated up repeatedly for adequate control.

7. Code: The ICU and neurology teams had many conversations with
the patient's mother and aunts re: code status. On [**11-15**], the pt
was made DNR but not DNI.
.
8. Ppx: Hep SC, bowel regimen, HOB>30 degrees, famotidine
.
