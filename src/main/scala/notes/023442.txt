CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pneumonia/delirium.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45 year old
female with a history of Hepatitis C, low grade lymphoma,
major depression and poly-substance abuse, who was admitted
to [**Hospital1 3494**] Intensive Care Unit on [**2-10**], with a
heroin and benzodiazepine overdose, as well as multi-lobar
pneumonia.  The patient was initially treated in [**Hospital1 3494**]
Intensive Care Unit with Gatifloxacin and Ceftriaxone until
the sputum came back positive for Moraxella catarrhalis.  She
clinically improved from a respiratory standpoint on
intravenous antibiotics.  She was on a Buprenorphine taper
for opiate withdrawal, however, she continued to be agitated
and delirious on Haldol.  Her transfer to [**Hospital1 346**] was requested per her son, since
patient received all of her medical care at [**Hospital1 346**].

Prior to transfer, the patient received 3 mg of Haldol.  On
arrival to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was minimally
responsive to sternal rub.  She was in significant
respiratory distress using accessory muscles, breathing 45
times per minute, with a temperature of 103.8 F., and
saturation of 99% on non-rebreather mask.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hepatitis C, Genotype 1B.  Liver biopsy in [**2112**] showed
chronic Hepatitis, Grade II inflammation, Stage II fibrosis.
She received Rebetron therapy for six months in [**2114-1-23**], and discontinued secondary to the depression.  She
received Interferon and Ribavirin combination in [**2115-1-24**].  Her last HCV viral load was 76,800 in [**2115-12-24**].
2.  Low-grade lymphoma with IgM gammopathy diagnosed in [**2112**].
3.  Intravenous drug use.
4.  Poly-substance abuse (heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines).
5.  Major depression.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Motrin 400 q. eight p.r.n.
2.  Tequin 400 mg intravenous q. day.
3.  Rocephin two grams q. 24 hours.
4.  Buprenex 0.3 mg intramuscularly q. eight.
5.  Gatifloxacin 200 intravenously.
6.  Ceftriaxone 1 gram q. 24 hours on [**2-12**].
7.  Haldol 2.5 mg q. one hour.
8.  Lactulose 30 p.o. twice a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Access intravenous drug abuse.  The rest
unavailable.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unavailable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 103.8 F.; heart rate 83;
blood pressure 113/51; respiratory rate 45, saturation 99% on
100% non-rebreather mask.  Generally, the patient was in
respiratory distress with visible accessory muscle use.
HEENT:  Pupils were reactive, 3 to 2.5 mm bilaterally.  The
patient was not tracking.  Her mucous membranes were dry.
Neck was slightly rigid.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs had diffuse wheeze and rhonchi.  Abdomen showed healed
low midline scar, good bowel sounds, slight distention, no
rebound or guarding.  Extremities showed no edema, two plus
distal pulses.

LABORATORY:  On admission from the outside hospital:  White
blood cell count 7.0, hematocrit 28.5, platelet count 110.
Chem-7, sodium 148, potassium 4.0, chloride 126, bicarbonate
20, BUN 26, creatinine 1.1, glucose 116.  ALT 48, AST 74,
total bilirubin 0.9.  Calcium 8.0, PTT 30.5, INR 1.1.

CK 505, 371, 157, negative troponin and negative MB.

Toxicology Screen positive for opiates, cocaine and
benzodiazepines.

Microbiology:  Blood cultures negative at 24 hours.  Sputum
culture positive for Moraxella catarrhalis.  Urine culture
negative.

Arterial blood gas on admission 7.3/48/285.

Chest x-ray on admission from [**Hospital3 **] showing
bilateral infiltrate and left sided small pleural effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  During this hospitalization, the patient's
issues included:
1.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  On admission, the
patient's clinical status was significantly worse than in the
outside hospital discharge.  Her hypercarbic respiratory
failure was felt to be likely due to the pneumonia.  Since
the decompensation was somewhat rapid, it was felt to be due
to new aspiration.  The patient was intubated on admission.
She was started on antibiotics and received a full course of
21 days of Zosyn and Levofloxacin.  The patient was extubated
on [**2116-2-27**].

2.  Lack of gag reflex:  Upon extubation, the patient
persisted with significant amounts of secretions that
required frequent suctioning.  She was noted to have an
absent gag reflex.  CT scan of her brain was obtained which
revealed no stroke.  Formal video swallow evaluation revealed
that the patient is aspirating all types of food.  After
extensive discussions with son and the patient, the patient
decided to proceed with a PEG tube which was placed by
Interventional Radiology on [**2116-3-11**].  The patient was
changed from Resporal to Ultracal tube feeds to provide
additional nutritional support.

3.  Delirium:  On admission, the patient's mental status was
severely depressed and she persisted being agitated.  On
admission, a head CT scan was performed and revealed no
structural lesions.  An lumbar puncture was performed looking
for infection or hemorrhage causing her delirium, however the
cerebrospinal fluid fluids did not indicate either hemorrhage
nor infection.  Through the initial part of her
hospitalization, while vented, the patient was sedated with
benzodiazepines and Fentanyl.  Following her extubation, the
patient's Fentanyl and Ativan were weaned slowly.  When
attempting to transition the patient from a Fentanyl drip to
a patch, significant withdrawal symptoms were observed and
the patient was continued on a slow Fentanyl drip taper.  She
was able to successfully come off of the Fentanyl drip and
her Valium was discontinued.  Her mental status continued to
improve.

4.  Multi-lobar pneumonia, fungemia:  For the last three days
of her 21-day course of antibiotics, the patient persisted to
spike fevers to 102.0 F.  With each fever spike, cultures
were obtained, and the blood cultures from [**3-10**], grew yeast
in one out of four bottles.  The patient was started on
Fluconazole with resolution of her fevers.  At that time, her
PICC line was discontinued and peripheral access obtained.

On [**3-16**], the patient was transferred to the Floor.  Her
care was taken over by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], who will dictate the
remainder of the discharge summary.
