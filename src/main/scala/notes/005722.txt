Chief Complaint:
Chest pain / Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
89 yo F with sign PMH of HTN, DM and hyperlipidemia presented to
[**Hospital 6930**] [**Hospital 12018**] Hospital with epigastric pain, increasing SOB,
increasing LE edema, nausea, and headaches. She is having
difficulty recalling the events of today so HPI is per her son
[**Name (NI) **]. She woke up this am and felt weaker than normal and was
having epigastric pain and LE edema. She also is having SOB
while lying flat as well. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
"questionable ECG changes" but a negative Troponin level. She is
on schedule for cardiac cath tomorrow for evaluation of coronary
artery disease.

On arrival to the floor, patient were T97.8 BP 146/70 HR 85 RR
18 100% RA She was having difficulty answering my questions on
exam and also was having difficulty describing the events that
led to her coming to the hospital. She was complaining of
feeling weak, and some epigastric pain. ECG showed no ischemic

DISCHARGE LABS:
.........
Colonoscopy Report:
Mild diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
Dark blood was seen in the whole colon.  The cecum was partial
obscured with dark blood, and the ileocecal valve could not be
entered.
The visualized colonic mucosa appears normal.
Bleeding could be from a proximal colonic or small bowel source-
but it is impossible to tell definitively from this study.  We
will discuss possibility of capsule endoscopy with primary team.

If rapid ongoing bleeding, consider tagged RBC scan and angio.

EGD Report:
Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

CARDIAC ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe calcific aortic stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild
to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

CARDIAC CATH:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated multivessel coronary disease.  The LMCA had a 50%
distal
stenosis extending into the LAD and LCx origin, but fractional
flow
reserve this stenosis was 0.91 suggesting that the degree of
angiographic stenosis may be overestimating the potential to
improve
coronary flow in this region with PCI.  The RCA was totally
occluded.The
patient and her family will consider whether to proceed with RCA
PCI.
2) Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right-sided
pressures
and mild pulmonary hypertension. The PCWP was
moderately-elevated at 22
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.96 l/min/m2, using an
assumed
oxygen consumption.  There was severe aortic stenosis with a
mean
gradient of 40 mmHg and a calculated aortic valve area of
0.8cm2.
3) Left ventriculography was not performed, as the aortic valve
was
calcified.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
1. Lungs are clear
2. Aortic and coronary atherosclerotic calcifications.
3. Aortic and dense mitral valvular calcification.
4. Left [**3-27**] lateral rib fx appear acute.
5. Nodular liver with caudate hypertrophy suggests cirrhosis


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 107637**] is a 87 yo F who presented to [**Hospital 6930**] [**Hospital 12018**]
hospital with chest pain, increasing shortnes of breath, head
ache and lower extremity edema. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
ischemic ECG changes and a diagnostic / theraputic cardiac cath.
Following catheterization, Ms. [**Known lastname 107637**] suffered a GI bleed for
which an exhaustive search could find no source and which
resolved spontaneously.
.
Active Problems:
#. CHEST PAIN - On arrival to the floor the patient was not
complaining of shortness of breath or chest pain. ECG's on floor
showed peaked T waves and approximately 1mm ST elevations in
V1-3 and a prolonged PR interval. These changes were also
present on a prior ECG from 5/[**2172**]. She had two negative
Troponins one at [**Hospital1 6930**] Regional and another here. She was
euvolemic on exam so her home dose of lasix was held.  We
continued her on Aspirin 325 mg, Amlodipine 5mg and lisinopril
10mg daily. We started Simvastating 20mg daily and Metoprolol
Tartrate 12.5mg daily during this admission. An echo cardiogram
was performed which showed severe calcific aortic stenosis and
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global
and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic
regurgitation and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation was
presnt as well as moderate pulmonary hypertension with an
LVEF>55%. These results were similar to a prior echo performed
in 5/[**2172**].   A cardiac cath was performed during this admission
which showed that the LMCA had a 50% distal stenosis extending
into the LAD and LCx origin, but fractional flow
reserve of this stenosis was 0.91. The RCA was totally occluded
and resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right-sided
pressures and mild pulmonary hypertension. The PCWP was
moderately-elevated at 22 The cardiac index was preserved at
2.96 l/min/m2, using an assumed oxygen consumption.  There was
severe aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 40 mmHg and a
calculated aortic valve area of 0.8cm2. CT surgery was consulted
who recommended core valve vs surgical valve replacement for
her. Her family has decided to hold off on surgery for now. They
would like her to rest and regain her energy before they decide
on surgery.

#. GI Bleed- She had one BM consisting of frank red blood with
clots. Her vital signs remai
