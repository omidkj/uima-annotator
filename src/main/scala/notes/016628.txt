trazodone (6 tabs) at 12-2pm today. She arrived to the ED with
talking with altered mental status, claiming to have taken these
pills in order to kill herself. SBP was initially in the 70s
which improved to the 90s with IVF's. Toxicology was consulted
and recommended following the QRS and QTc complexes carefully.
Initially, QRS 104, QTc 430. The patient then seized briefly and
BP fell to 50/30. She was given 2mg ativan and intubated for
airway protection with succ only. A right subclavian line was
placed as levophed was being initiated via a peripheral line. A
repeat EKG was found to have a slightly wider QRS (104-->110),
and she was given 1 amp HCO3 with no effect, QRS remains 110.
Once intubated, she was switched from ativan to versed for
seizure ppx. Upon transfer, she is AF, HR 71, 130/88 on 0.09
levophed, R 14 on vent sats 100% - last ABG was 7.35/34/152 on
A/C 600x14 peep 5 fio2 0.5. She is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management.
.
The patient has had multiple admissions at this hospital for
multiple suicide attempts and self-injurious acts cutting,
burning, head-banging, and swallowing. Of note, she was recently
hospitalized on the inpatient psychiatric service from
[**Date range (2) 18781**] after she was sent by her outpatient
psychiatrists on a section 12 for suicidal ideation. Per her
last discharge summary, the patient has been struggling
emotionally in the last few months, she recently lost her job,
lost her boyfriend, has been having a hard time in therapy and
has been having difficulty transitioning to a more functional
status.  The patient had a depressed mood throughout her
admission but was able to maintain emotional regulations. Most
of her outpatient medications were continued including
lamotrigine, clomipramine, clozapine, chlorpromazine prn. For
her PTSD and anxiety, she was continued on xanax with temazepam
prn.  Prazosin and inderal were discontinued due to persistent
orthostasis. She was also continued on her home dose of ritalin
LA and for insomnia she took trazodone which was decreased due
to orthostatic hypotension. She was discharged on [**7-27**] to the
care of her outpatient psychiatrist.
.
ROS: unable to obtain ROS, given that the patient is sedated and
intubated.

CXR [**2152-8-27**]
CONCLUSION:
A radiodensity projected the right costophrenic angle most
likely represents nipple shadow and followup chest radiograph
with nipple markers is advised. There is no pneumothorax. The
right-sided central line has its tip projected over the right
atrium. There are focal densities in the left upper lung of
unclear etiology, possibly infiltrate.
.
CXR [**2152-8-28**]
 In comparison with study of [**8-27**], the right subclavian catheter
has
been pulled back to the mid portion of the SVC. Endotracheal
tube tip lies
approximately 3.5 cm above the carina and nasogastric tube
extends well into the stomach. The suspected opacification in
the left suprahilar region is not appreciated on this study,
though it could possibly be covered over by mediastinal
structures given the increase in obliquity of the patient.
Atelectatic changes are seen at the left base silhouetting the
descending aorta.




Brief Hospital Course:
# Overdose: Pt took 80 thorazine and 6 trazadone as suicide
attempt, (per patient herself on arrival). Toxicology on board.
Pt had seizure in ED and was intubated for airway protection.
She was extubated the following morning.  Pt monitored in ICU
for anticholingergic signs, hypotension (from peripheral alpha
blockade), extrapyramidal signs, QTc prolongation, rarely QRS
prolongation.  Serial ECGs were done to assess for QRS/QTc and
were stable. Pt was monitore with q4h neuro checks.  She
remained stable and was transferred to regular floor. The
patient did n
