History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 67 y.o. M from [**Hospital3 537**] with recent history
of pneumonia, presented with fever, tachycardia, and increased
lethargy. History from RN at [**Hospital3 537**] and faxed medical
records.  The patient lives at [**Hospital3 537**] and was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2177**] from [**10-31**] to [**11-4**] and diagnosed with
aspiration pneumonia.  He completed a course of cefpodoxime and
Flagyl.  Around 8 PM, the patient was noted to be lethargic and
did not open eyes with name calling, moaning.  He desat'ed to
88% on RA and improved to 92% on 2 L NC He was also noted to be
febrile.  MD was called and referred patient via ambulance to
[**Hospital1 2177**].  VS at [**Last Name (un) **]: 140/69  HR 121  RR 28  T 100.6.  Ambulance
diverted to [**Hospital1 18**].  Of note, patient was to complete hospice
referral on [**2163-11-7**].
.
In the ED, initial VS: T 101.6  HR 122  BP 127/70  RR 33  O2 96%
on 10 L NRB.  Labs, blood cultures x 2, and urine culture were
sent. Portable CXR was completed. EKG completed, noted with some
lateral changes so Cards consulted.  The patient was intubated
with etomidate and succinylcholine, then sedated with fentanyl
and midazolam.  ABG performed.  Placed OG tube and noted thick
green coating on dry tongue.  NG lavage with some thick black
looking material, ? coffee grounds, but cleared quickly.  Rectal
with guiaic + brown stools, so GI consulted.  He was given
levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1 and Zosyn x 1.  Acetaminophen 1300 mg
PR x 1, IV Protonix 40 mg IV x 1 then gtt at 8/hour, and Vitamin
K 10 mg IV x 1 were given. He was also given 3.5 L IVFs.
Discussed CVL but deferred given supratherapeutic INR.
.
Currently, the patient is sedated and intubated.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain due to sedation and intubation

Brief Hospital Course:
67 y.o. M from [**Hospital3 537**] with recent history of pneumonia,
presented with fever, tachycardia, and increased lethargy, found
to have pneumonia, admitted to ICU s/p intubation for
respiratory failure.

1. Respiratory Failure: Secondary to dense pneumonia that was
seen on portable CXR. Intubated in ED for tachypnea and work of
breathing.  Pt was admitted to the ICU.  Treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin / cefepime / ciprofloxacin, for
hospital acquired pneumonia given recent hospitalization and
living in [**Hospital3 537**].  Pt was rapidly weaned from ventilator
and extubated on [**11-7**].  Sputum culture without pseudomonas, so
ciprofloxacin was stopped.  Course of antibiotics for 8 days.

2. Sepsis: Secondary to pneumonia on CXR.  Treated with
antibiotics as above. Pan-cultured.  Lactate was not elevated.
No pressors needed.

3. Altered mental status: On admission to ICU, pt's eyes noted
to be non-reactive to light.  ?  cataract surgery, but unable to
get history. CT head negative for acute bleed.  Per family, pt's
baseline is "yes" and "no".  Likely altered mental status due to
infections, R arm pain (RSD).

4. ? GI bleeding: + guiaic positive in ED with supratherapeutic
INR.  GI was consulted. Followed patient's Hct which was stable.
Active T&S maintained, Guiaiced all stools. 2 large bore PIVs.
IV PPI gtt initiated in the ED, then changed to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].

5. Elevated troponins: Elevated Troponin may be secondary to
renal failure, ruled out MI with serial enzymes and EKGs.  Cards
evaluated EKG in ED and believed it was demand ischemia.  By
report, EKG with old inferior Qs.
.
6. Coagulopathy: PT, PTT, INR all elevated. Likely interaction
between recent flagyl use and coumadin.  But also may be
secondary to DIC, although platelets within normal limits. Also
likely nutritional deficiency. DIC labs negative. Held coumadin.
 Given 10 IV K in ED with decrease in INR.  Restarted low dose
coumadin but stopped given goals of care.

7. CKD, stage 4: Recently discharged with Cr 2 from [**Hospital1 2177**]. Likely
pre-renal as pt appeared intravasculary dry on admission. Fluid
resuscitated with D5W given hypernatermia. Cr trended down.

8. Hypernatremia: Na 155 on admission.  D5W @ 120 cc / hour for
20 hours for correction.  Na serially monitored and normalized
during ICU stay.

9. Type 2 DM: Fingersticks and labs were discontinued as per
family wishes for patient to receive comfort measures only.

10. Hyperlipidemia: Zetia and Lipitor were discontinued as per
family wishes for patient to receive comfort measures only.

11. HTN: Beta blocker and amlodipine were initially held in
setting of questionable GI bleed, but discontinued as per family
wishes for patient to receive comfort measures only.

12. Stage 2 Sacral Decub:  Patient received wound care.  Cleaned
with normal saline, duoderm gel, and gauze dressing daily.

14. R arm pain: X ray negative. From OSH records, may be RSD.
Continued low dose neurontin and lidocaine patch.

15. Goals of care: On [**11-8**], family meeting was held and patient
was made DNR/DNI/comfort measures only by HCP.  [**Name (NI) **] was
transferred to the floor on [**11-9**]. Antibiotics were continued as
he was clinically improving, but they were discontinued on
discharge.  Morphine for pain.  Palliative care was consulted.
Patient is discharged with hospice care.
