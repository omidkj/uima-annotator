Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers, chills for 2 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
50 yo with Crohn's disease with short gut syndrome on TPN since
'[**43**] with h/o >6 episodes of line infection most recent over 1
year ago, presents with f/c x 2 days. The pt denies any chest
pain, SOB. He states that he is able to run for 6 miles, which
has has continued to do until this past week. He denies cough,
n/v. He denies dysuria, change in urinary volume/frequency, d/c.
   In the ED, th pt was afebrile, had a bp of 98/59  he was not
tachycardic, and was satting mid-high 90's on room air. His bp
did  drop to the 80's, and he got 7 liters of normal saline with
an improvement in his bp. He never required pressor support. The
pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care. He was noted to
have bacteremia with GNBs, and GPC awaiting further micro data.
The Chest CT was concerning for possible septic pulmonary
emboli, vs infection. He got vanco, ceftriaxone, gentamycin,
levofloxacin, dexamethasone, and morphine for muscle aches.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: New bilateral interstitial pattern as well as patchy areas
of opacity in the right lower lobe posteriorly and in the
periphery of the left mid lung zone, the latter with a slightly
nodular configuration. In the setting of fever, this may
represent mycoplasma pneumonia or other atypical pneumonia.
Septic embolism should also be considered given apparent nodular
configuration of peripheral left lung opacity.
.
CTA:1. No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Diffuse
ground-glass opacities within both lungs, with more focal areas
of
nodular opacities, demonstrated in the periphery of the left
lower lobe, lingula, and right middle lobe. These findings are
all concerning for infectious process. The absence of cavitation
within these nodular opacities likely favors septic emboli as a
possible process. The patient is immunocompromised, a fungal
infection is also a possibility. 3. Interlobular septal
thickening with small bilateral pleural effusions, suggestive of
mild volume overload
.
Echo [**2157-9-28**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)  are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2156-6-30**], no major chgange is evident. The absence of a vegetation
by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically
suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50 yo M with h/o stable crohn's, short guts syndrome s/p
bowel resection [**2143**], on chronic TPN, now presents with
f/c/rigors x2 days, found to have GNB/GPC bacteremia, chest CT
concerning for septic emboli.
.
1. Line Infection GNB/GPC:
The pt was found in the ED to be afebrile, had a bp of 98/59  he
was not tachycardic, and was satting mid-high 90's on room air.
His bp did drop to the 80's, and he got 7 liters of normal
saline with an improvement in his bp. He never required pressor
support. The pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further care. He
was noted to have bacteremia with GNBs, and GPC awaiting further
micro data. The Chest CT was concerning for possible septic
pulmonary emboli, vs infection. He got vanco, ceftriaxone,
gentamycin, levofloxacin. Gent was d/c'ed, leaving the other 3
abx.  On abx, and with supportive care, the stabilized and was
hemodynamically stable by HD#3 and ready to go to the medicine
floor, looking very well. The blood culture data was followed.
The ID consultants followed along. The pt was monitored on the
floor for for 2 days and found to be stable. He had a PICC line
placed, with a plan to change it for a tunneled catheter as an
outpatient, once the infection was certain to be completely
cleared. The pt was discharged on abx with a plan to follow up
in [**Hospital **] clinic [**2158-10-24**] at 11am.
.
2. Nodules on Chest CT
Possible septic pulmonary emboli vs infectious infiltrates,
perhaps chronic since nodules also noted on previous CT. Recent
CT did not comment on comparison to previous CT. No vegetations
on Echo. The plan was to contine IV abx and to have a chest CT
as outpt to assess for resolution.
.
3. Short gut syndrome:
Pt eats small amounts at home, supplemented by TPN. Long-term
TPN since '[**43**]. Low fat, lactose restricted diet was continued.
TPN was continued. RISS was instituted during the stay.
.
4. Thrombocytopenia:
stable since admission, which is not c/w against HIT. Unlikely
DIC. It was followed.
5. FEN: low fat, lactose restricted diet, TPN.
6. PPx: sc heparin
7. Acess: will plan for tunneled catheter.
