Allergies:
Compazine / Codeine / Atenolol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4365**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension/somnolence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of central venous line


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10983**] is a 61 year old male with past medical history
munchhausens syndrome, anti-social behaviour, possible PTSD who
frequently presents here to ED with hypotension and somnolence.
In the past pt was discovered to have been hording his blood
pressure medication (mainly clonidine) and taking it all at
once. Pt also admitted in the past with eating his clonidine
patch. In the past this had led to multiple ICU admissions, with
ARF and most recently MI as a consequence. This time patient
brought in to the hospital by EMS after being found poorly
responsive.

In the ED his initial vital signs were T 98, BP 120/60, HR 66,
RR 8, O2sat 99%4L. 100 mg hydrocortisone, started on levophed
for subsequent hypotension, kayexilate/insulin/glucose for
hyperkalemia, renal consult for ARF, Vanc/zosyn for possible
sepsis. Bedside FAST u/s was negative for bleeding. Narcane
produced agitation and agressive bahaviour, pt started on
empiric heparin drip for possible PE given history.

ROS not obtained as pt barely arousable.



Past Medical History:
- anti social behaviour leading to discharge from shelters,
- munchhausens syndrome
- s/p STEMI w/ BMS in LAD in [**10-1**], due to GI bleed stopped
plavix cont only aspiring
- Malignant Hypertension: thought to be secondary to medication

non-compliance, but had hypotension during recent admission in
[**10-31**] and BP meds were cut back. (most likely due to Clonidine
effect: overdose/ withdrawal)
- Pulmonary Embolus: Recurrent [**Month/Year (2) 11011**] s/p IVC filter , not on
coumadine due to non compliance
- Heroin abuse: methadone maintenance clinic [**Street Address(2) 11016**]
daily at 7AM (most recent daily dose on [**Month (only) 462**] 135 mg daily.

- Hepatitis B previous infection, now sAg negative
- Hepatitis C, undetectable HCV RNA [**3-29**]
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease
- PTSD ([**Country 3992**] veteran)
- Anxiety / Depression
- Antisocial personality disorder
- Microcytic anemia
- Vitamin B12 deficiency
- Chronic kidney disease baseline Cr 1.5


Social History:
[**Country 3992**] veteran. Past heroin abuse, now on methadone. On
disability. Currently living at [**Doctor Last Name **] House.

[**2108-12-1**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial
process seen including acute intracranial hemorrhage. Exam is
unchanged from multiple recent prior studies except to note
small locules of gas along the muscles of mastication on the
right, which are of uncertain clinical significance. If acute
infarction remains a concern, MRI would be recommeneded for more
sensitive evaluation.

[**2108-12-1**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly, with bibasilar atelectasis and
pulmonary
vascular prominance, likely accentuated due to low lung volumes.
No overt
heart failure.

[**2108-12-1**] Bilat Lower extremity ultrasound: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of DVT seen in either lower extremity.
2. Interval resolution of thrombosis involving the right common
femoral vein through the right upper calf veins, as seen on most
recent prior ultrasound of [**2108-10-28**].
3. Diffusely decreased respiratory variation in venous waveforms
again
suggestive of more proximal thrombosis.

[**2108-12-1**] Renal US: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Allowing for patient motion, no definite stone or renal mass
seen. Diffusely increased renal echotexture again consistent
with medical renal disease.

[**2108-12-1**] CT abd/pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar patchy pulmonary opacities, could be consistent
with aspiration, pneumonia, or atelectasis.
2. Cardiac enlargement, with small pericardial effusion.
3. No evidence of abdominal or pelvic hematoma.
4. Expansion and thickening of the IVC (inferior to the IVC
filter), common iliac veins, right external iliac vein, and
right common femoral vein are again consistent with chronic
thrombosis, with many collateral vessels noted along the
anterior abdominal wall.
5. Moderate-to-large amount of stool.
6. Small hyperdense lesions in the right kidney are unchanged,
possibly
representing hyperdense cysts. No evidence of hydronephrosis or
stone noted in the kidneys.

[**2108-12-3**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the distal segments and probable dyskinesis
of the apex. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is
eccentric and may be underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-11-21**],
global LV systolic function is slightly better. The distal
segments remain hypokinetic. The degree of mitral regurgitation
has decreased. The LV thrombus seen on the echo of 10//[**3-31**] is
not seen on the current study.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a homeless 61 year old male with a past medical history
of medication overdose with clonidine, repeat acute renal
failure and recent STEMI status post bare metal stent to LAD,
hypertension/hyotension, post-tramatic stress disorder, and
depression who presents with hypotension somnolence.

# Hypotension/somnolence: Symptoms consistent with and likely
due to Clonidine overdose  (bradycardia, hypotension and
lethargy, miosis).  This has occurred before in setting of
patient's Munchausen syndrome.  Patient was monitered in the
intensive care unit, with supportive therapy and improvement of
his symptoms, and was stable enough to come to the regular floor
where his outpatient medications were re-started.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Acute on chronic renal
failure, most likely due to hypotension in the setting of
medication overdose.  Resolved with IV fluids and supportive
management.  Renal was involved.
.
# Anemia: Guiac negative, remained stable.
.
# Chronic systo
