Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to MICU for evaluation of HTNive urgency with acute
change in mental status after hemodialysis.  Pt re-examined in
MICU, noted to be intermittently irrational and confrontational
to sleepy and unable to answer any previously correctly answered
questions appropriately- change within moments.  Question of
subtle rhythmic leg movement vs restless leg movement.
THroughout first hospital night, pt was weaned off of
nitroglycerin gtt but refused to take home BP meds, maintained
SBP between 140s to 160s.  In AM of HD2, pt remained stable in
confrontational state, no [**Doctor Last Name 688**].  Seen and examined with PCP
and MICU team; PCP states that this has been pts new baseline
recently, but that the [**Doctor Last Name 688**] episode is new since last week
when he recieved a phone call from pts brother about a similar
episode. EEG negative for epileptiform activity, although pt
does have increased discharges in right frontal lobe. Pt
recieved hemodialysis daily for 3 days (ED, MICU day 1, MICU day
2). Pt with stable vital signs and returning to baseline mental
status, tolerating POS, and ambulating without difficulty.  Pt
discharged for close followup with PCP Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5762**], likely that pt
had presented with a CHF/ HTNive episode from fluid overload
requiring HD and a recurrent metabolic encephalopathy from
osmotic shifts [**3-15**] hemodialysis.
