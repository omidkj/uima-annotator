Pertinent Results:
[**2189-12-24**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There
is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic function. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
root. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area
0.8-1.19cm2) Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. POST-CPB: On phenylephrine
infusion. There is a well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the
aortic position with no AI seen. Flow is seen in the LMCA. The
measured gradient across the aortic valve is now 6 mmHg. There
is preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF 65%. There is
no [**Male First Name (un) **]. MR is trace. The aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.
[**2189-12-29**] CXR: Bilateral pleural effusions have significantly
decreased in size since prior exam. Small bilateral pleural
effusions remain. The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar
contours are stable in size status post CABG and AVR. The
pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no pneumothorax. No
consolidations are seen bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80687**] was a same day admit (underwent pre-op work-up as on
outpatient) and was brought directly to the operating room where
he underwent a redo coronary artery bypass graft x 3 and aortic
valve replacement. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Beta blockers and diuretics were initiated and he was gently
diuresed towards his pre-op weight. He was then transferred to
the telemetry floor. On post-op day three his chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed. Post-op his HCT was low
and on day three it was 19. He was therefore transfused with
several units of blood. By discharge it was 24.9. Also on
post-op day three he had an episode of atrial fibrillation. He
was bolused with Amiodarone and given Lopressor. Lopressor was
titrated, Amiodarone was eventually given PO and he was started
on Heparin. Coumadin was started on post-op day four and
titrated for goal INR between [**12-26**]. INR abruptly rose up to 5 by
post-op day five and Coumadin was held and INR trended down
towards therapeutic level by discharge. On post-op day five
antibiotics were started d/t left arm phlebitis. Physical
therapy followed patient during entire post-op course for
strength and mobility. He appeared to be doing well on post-op
day six and was discharged home with VNA services and the
appropriate follow-up appointments. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact and
will manage his Coumadin as an outpatient.
