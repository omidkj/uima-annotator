Admission Date:  [**2163-11-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2163-11-15**]


Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a very pleasant
84-year-old right handed man was admitted to the Medicine
service with a syncopal episode.  He reported that he had not
been feeling himself for the last week.  He felt unsteady and
slow.  He had fallen.  In addition, he states that for the
last 6-8 months, he has noted a gradual decline in his
energy, and has not felt right.  He stopped going to the gym
for his usual workouts.

A cardiac evaluation was largely unremarkable.  A CT scan of
the head was obtained.  This showed an enormous, loculated,
mixed density right subdural hematoma.  There is massive
right to left shift.  In addition, there is a much smaller
left sided subdural hematoma.  The patient therefore, was
admitted for further evaluation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Labetalol.
2. Hydrochlorothiazide.
3. Lasix.
4. Isosorbide.
5. Norvasc.
6. Hydralazine.
7. Colchicine.
8. Aspirin.
9. Allopurinol.
10. Nitroglycerin.
11. Timoptic.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient takes care of his wife, who is
home with dementia.  He drinks [**1-6**] vodkas per night.  He
denies tobacco use.  He was able to do all of his activities
of daily living.  The patient is retired from the military.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert.  He
has no external signs of trauma.  He is complaining of a bit
of headache and not feeling quite himself.  He is a bit
confused and cannot name the hospital.  His short-term memory
is [**2-9**] at five minutes.  He has a slight pronator drift on
the left.  He is easily distracted and has difficulty
cooperating with many of the tests of cognitive function.
His neck is supple.  His chest is clear.  Cardiac:  Regular,
rate, and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  He has
reflexes which are 2+ in the upper extremities and absent in
the lower extremities.  His right toe is upgoing.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2163-11-4**].  At that time, he underwent a right sided
craniotomy for an enormous right sided subdural hematoma and
placement of a burr hole on the left.  He tolerated this
procedure well.  Because of the massive shift, a subdural
drain was left in place.  Immediately after surgery, the
patient was awake and alert.  He was complaining of
incisional pain and headache.

Over the course of the next 24 hours, he became extremely
agitated and confused.  This required enormous amounts of
sedation.  The patient was requiring Valium and Haldol
around-the-clock.  When he was allowed to wake, he would be
restless and thrashing.  He had a single focal motor seizure,
and was started on Dilantin.

During his hospital course, he had no further seizures.  The
patient largely remained afebrile.  He required some oxygen,
but his O2 saturations were good and his chest x-rays
remained clear.  He was started on tube feeds.  Over the next
week, his sedation was gradually lightened.  A followup CT
scan of the head was obtained.  This showed a dramatic
improvement in the subdural hematoma and mass effect.  There
was no shift and very minimal mass effect.  The subdural
fluid collection on the left was a tiny bit larger.

Over the 48 hours prior to discharge, the patient's mental
status improved significantly.  He had his eyes open.  He
would speak in [**2-7**] word phrases.  He began answering
questions, although was clearly confused.  He was seen by
Physical Therapy.  He got up to a chair and tolerated this
well for five or six hours.  He walked short distance with a
rolling walker with the minimal assistance of the physical
therapist.  It was felt that the patient was an excellent
candidate for rehabilitation, and that his mental status
could continue to improve.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Subdural hematoma bilateral.
2. Hypertension.
3. Gout.
4. Glaucoma.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. Seizure.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is being discharged to
inpatient rehabilitation.  He is felt to be an excellent
rehabilitation candidate.
