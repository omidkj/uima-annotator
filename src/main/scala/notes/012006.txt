History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 year old male with history of severe mitral regurg
originally presented to OSH w/ 3 months of constitutional
symptoms including "leg heaviness" and 5 days of N/V/anorexia.
He was dx w/ mitral valve endocarditis, BCX growing Strep
viridans, and was treated w/ a dose of levofloxacin. Initial
labs demonstrated acute renal failure w/ hyperkalemia and HCT 18
requiring PRBC transfusion. He was concurrently diagnosed with
bladder outlet obstruction after foley catheter placement was
attempted and failed multiple times. This prompted his transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care including Urology consultation. ROS on
admission: Admits to dry cough and SOB X 1 day. He denies
headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied
chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No blood in his stool. No dysuria or blood in
his urine. Denied arthralgias or myalgias. No history of TB
exposure. Admits to HIV negative in the past.

Past Medical History:
MV Endocarditis with Mitral Regurgitation, Renal Failure,
Pulmonary Hypertension, Anemia


Social History:
Lifetime nonsmoker/drinker, no recreation drugs. He lives with
parents, and employed as a drywaller.  Had to quit work in
[**Month (only) 404**] secondary to Leg heaviness.  Has 2 children: 12 and 17.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2191-7-11**] 9:09 AM
CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: evaluate effusion
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
49 year old man with s/p mVR, endocarditis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
INDICATIONS: 49-year-old man with endocarditis status post
mitral valve repair. Evaluate effusion.
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Comparison is made to [**2191-7-5**]. A double
lumen right internal jugular venous catheter again terminates in
the superior vena cava. A left-sided PICC line is also
unchanged, terminating in the SVC. The patient is status post
sternotomy and mitral valve replacement. There is persistent
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with a stable effusion and
atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
Stable small left-sided pleural effusion and elevation of left
hemidiaphragm.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
