Social History:
Currently at [**Hospital3 **]. Prior to her CVA was living on [**Location (un) **] with her daughter living on floor below. She is a widow,
was working full time in accounting and finance. Former smoker,
40 pack year history. Denies EtOH or illicits.


Family History:

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 98.6 F    BP 131/48   P 71    RR 20    SaO2 98 RA
General: NAD, well-nourished
HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, MMM
Neck: no nuchal rigidity, no bruits
Lungs: clear to auscultation
CV: regular rate and rhythm, no MMRG
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present
Ext: warm, no edema, pedal pulses appreciated
Skin: left foot slightly erythematous, pedal pulses difficult to
appreciate

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status:
Sleepy, inattentive, repeatedly drifting back to sleep during
examination, appears abulic, states one-two words at most (can
occasionally state "yes" or "no"), seems to comprehend basic
examination commands (example, for strength testing) while
awake.
Seems to attend primarily to right space.

Cranial Nerves:
Fundi are difficult to appreciate, as she closes her eyes
forcefully.  Pupils slightly irregular bilaterally but equally
reactive to light, ~3 to 2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular
movements
intact, no nystagmus.  States that facial sensation to light
touch is symmetric.  Right upper motor neuron facial droop.
Hearing intact conversational volume.  Tongue protrudes midline,
but does not open mouth much further.  Trapezii full on the left
and [**3-11**] on the right.

Motor:
Difficult to assess tone reliability given pain in extremities.
No tremor.  She does not participate in formal testing, except
in
the left arm, due to pain.  The left arm is full throughout,
except at the deltoid, which is 4+/5; the deltoid was tested
last
and some of the weakness may have been effort related.  She is
able to weakly lift the right arm against gravity, but does not
participate further due to pain.  She is able to wiggle her legs
in the plane of the bed, but again does not want to move much
more due to pain.

Sensation: She does states that sensation to light touch is
preserved and symmetric throughout, though the right side is
exquisitely painful to the touch, as noted above.  I deferred
response to noxious given her pain.

Reflexes: B T Br
Right     2 1 2
Left      2 1 2
The reflexes in the lower extremities could not be elicited in
the setting of poor relaxation with pain.  Toes were equivocal
bilaterally.

Coordination and gait could not be adequately or safely
performed
due to somnolence and weakness

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Echo:

The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. No definite structural cardiac source
of embolism identified.

Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2186-12-6**], the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
and severity of mitral regurgitatio are now lower.

CTA:

Extensive vascular atherosclerotic dz with calcifications.
Non-occlusive
thrombus within common hepatic aa (3a,15), calcifications at the
ostia of all branches from the aorta. Left external iliac
thombus originating at the bifurcation (3a,88) with no flow
distally to the left lower extremity except for a short segment
of reconstitution at the proximal left superficial femoral aa.
?contrast in the left deep profunda aa- hard to visualize with
extensive calcifications. Minimal contrast opacification of the
right superficial femoral aa. Recons pending.

CT of Head:

There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage or shift of normally
midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are prominent
consistent with
age-related atrophy. Again identified is hypodensity in the left
frontal lobe consistent with prior MCA stroke. Bilateral basal
ganglia calcifications are noted. Study is limited due to slight
motion. The basilar cisterns are
patent. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
Calcifications of the
carotid and vertebral arteries are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 100336**] E  was admitted on [**4-2**] with Ischemic cold
left leg. She was put in the CVICU. IV heparin started. She
agreed to have an elective surgery. Pre-operatively, she was
consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were
obtained,  all other preperations were made.

Started on IV AB.

Mucomyst and bicarb given preoperatively for renal protection.
