   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2176-8-16**] 10:39 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o inf, eff

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf, eff
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after CABG.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**8-11**]
and [**2176-8-13**].

The cardiomediastinal post-surgical appearance is stable. The
lungs are hyperinflated with underlying emphysema changes again
noted but there is no new infiltrates, masses or nodules. The
pleural effusions are bilateral and small, stable.

IMPRESSION: Stable small bilateral pleural effusions. Emphysema.
Otherwise, stable appearance of post-surgical chest.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)

Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.2 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% to 55% (nl >=55%)
[**Doctor Last Name **] - Valve Level: 3.5 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
[**Doctor Last Name **] - Ascending: *3.5 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
[**Doctor Last Name **] - Descending Thoracic: *2.6 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal anterior
- normal; mid anterior - normal; basal anteroseptal - normal;
mid anteroseptal
- normal; basal inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal -
normal; basal
inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal; basal inferolateral -
normal; mid
inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral - normal; mid
anterolateral -
normal; anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex
- hypo;
lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

[**Doctor Last Name **]: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending [**Doctor Last Name 5236**]
diameter. Mildly dilated descending [**Doctor Last Name 5236**]. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
descending thoracic [**Doctor Last Name 5236**].

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
Mild systolic
dysfxn of distal and apical segments of LV. The descending
thoracic [**Doctor Last Name 5236**] is
mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic
[**Doctor Last Name 5236**]. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no
pericardial effusion.

Post procedure (patient had Off-Pump coronary bypasses) :
Preserved
biventricular systolic fxn. No AI. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5235**]. Other
parameters as
pre-bypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**8-9**] for right CEA done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Monitored
over the weekend, and underwent cabg x3 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**8-12**].
Extubated late that evening, and transferred to the floor on POD
#1 to begin increasing his activity level. Gentle diuresis
started and beta blockade titrated. Chest tubes and pacing wires
removed per protocol. ACE inhibitor also started for tighter BP
management. He continued to progess and was ready for discharge
home POD 4 with services.
