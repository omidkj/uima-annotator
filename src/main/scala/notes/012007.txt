CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Motor vehicle crash.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 82-year-old male
involved in a high speech motor vehicle crash, which was
head-on.  The patient was a driver of a vehicle that collided
head-on into a tractor trailer.  The patient was
unrestrained, and there was airbag deployment.  Patient was
found unresponsive at the scene.  Patient was intubated
without difficulty at the scene.  Patient had flaccid
extremities during the initial assessment.  The patient was
transferred to an outside hospital, stabilized, and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Benign prostate hyperplasia.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Terazosin 5 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Finasteride 5 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.6, pulse
86, blood pressure 145/74, respiratory rate 20, and O2
saturation is 100%, intubated.  General:  Patient is sedated,
unresponsive to voice.  Eyes open spontaneously.  Pupils are
equal and reactive, but sluggish 3 to 2 bilaterally.
Oropharynx is clear.  Trachea is midline.  Regular rate and
rhythm.  Patient was clear to auscultation with equal breath
sounds.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.  The
pelvis was stable.  The back had no step-offs or deformities.
Rectal tone was decreased, but guaiac negative.  Patient had
footdrop bilaterally with cool feet.  Right knee was swollen
and both knees had abrasions.

LABORATORIES:  Initial white cell count 9.5, hematocrit 38.8,
platelets 138.  Chem-7:  144, 4.2, 109, 24, 23, 1.1, glucose
152, lactate 2.2.  The coags:  14, 29.2, and 1.3.  Fibrinogen
225.  Amylase 145.

Head CT at the outside hospital was negative.  C spine CT
showed a C2 fracture.  Abdomen and pelvis CT showed 4 x 4.5
cm intramural thrombus, but no extravasation.  The bladder
was normal.

X-rays of the right knee showed no fractures.  X-rays of the
right hand show a questionable old fracture on the thumb.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
service and monitored in the Intensive Care Unit.
Neurosurgery was consulted immediately.  The Neurosurgery
service had strong concerns for a cervical cord contusion.
They requested a stat MRI and that the blood pressure be
controlled for greater than 120 systolic.  They also
recommended the patient stay in the cervical collar, and that
the Solu-Medrol be given per protocol.

During the initial part of the patient's admission, he was
hemodynamically stable.  He required initially fluid and
pressors for blood pressure control, but stabilized within
the first day.  This is most likely due to volume contraction
and neurologic shock.  The MR of the neck showed a cord
compression and contusion with a small epidural hematoma.
Neurosurgery's recommendations included keeping his blood
pressure above 120 and to his keep his coagulation studies in
the normal range.

Over the course of the next several days, the patient's
neurologic status slightly improved.  He was alert, followed
commands, but was still considered quadriplegic.  The patient
can move his left side more than his right.  His strength in
the knee left was roughly a [**2-27**].

On [**1-12**], the patient's TLS were cleared
radiographically.  Neurosurgery was slightly more optimistic
in the sense that the patient can move his upper and lower
extremities slightly more than previously.  The final read on
the TLS films were concerning for a questionable old fracture
at the T5-T6 level.  Orthopedics was consulted, and
recommended logroll precautions, and a thoracic brace until
the patient could be extubated and evaluated clinically.
They felt that the fracture was an old fracture, and that he
did not require acute interventions.

Plastic Surgery also evaluated the patient for the right hand
fracture, which was deemed to be an old injury.  Their
recommendations were to follow the patient clinically, and
there was pain in all, in the right thumb, to splint the
extremity.

On the [**1-13**], the patient was well enough to be
extubated.  Due to the large amount of secretions, the
patient was reintubated on the 21st.  At that time, the
patient still remained pseudoquadriplegic.  He could breathe
spontaneously and move his left upper extremity
spontaneously, but had minimal movement in his legs or his
right arm.

On the 22nd, a family meeting was convened, and it was
decided that the patient would continue with full support,
and that we would hold on a tracheostomy and a PEG placement
until the following week.  During that time, his neurologic
status would be evaluated.  At that time, we would also have
a better idea regarding his prognosis.

On the [**1-16**], the patient had a lower extremity
noninvasive ultrasound, which showed no evidence of DVTs.
The patient also continued with aggressive diuresis, and his
vent settings were changed to CPAP.  The patient continued to
produce a large amount of secretions and required assist
control for ventilation.  It was decided that the patient
would require a tracheostomy as his chances of weaning off
the vent are unrealistic.

A second family meeting was held, and it was decided that the
patient's wishes as dictated in his power of attorney would
limit the ICU team's actions.  His power of attorney stated
that the setting of the need for life support and/or heroic
measures to keep him alive, his decision would be to withdraw
support.

After an extensive family meeting with the patient's son, it
was decided that the patient will be made DNR/DNI, and the
patient will be extubated.  If the patient was stable, he
would continue with fully medical support.  If he became
unstable, then he would be made CMO.  Patient was extubated
and continued with respiratory distress due to the high
secretions.

On the [**1-24**], the patient continued with
respiratory distress, continued with the pseudoquadriplegia,
and was becoming hemodynamically unstable.  A decision
between the Trauma team, the ICU team, and the family was to
make the patient care measures only.

On the [**1-24**], the patient expired.  The family was
notified.
