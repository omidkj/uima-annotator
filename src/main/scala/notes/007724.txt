BRIEF DESCRIPTION AND HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was
admitted on [**2183-2-18**], and she underwent a retrosternal colon
interposition with colojejunostomy and colocolostomy, feeding
jejunostomy, and draining duodenostomy.  The procedure was
performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and he was assisted by
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6644**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 18078**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14968**].  The procedure was
done without any complications.  The patient tolerated the
procedure without any difficulty.  The patient was sent to
the Postanesthesia Care Unit still intubated, but in
satisfactory condition.  The patient remained intubated for
the first 24 hours due to a history of COPD.  The patient was
transferred up to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where she
was extubated after successfully passing spontaneous
breathing trial.  While in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit,
the patient did quite well, with her only complaint being
large amount of pain in her abdomen.  The patient was also
tachycardic, but was known to be so at baseline prior to her
surgery.  The patient's duodenal tubes and cervical tubes
were draining serosanguinous fluid.  The patient was noted to
have postoperative anemia and was transfused with 1 unit of
packed red blood cells.  The patient was seen and evaluated
by Acute Pain Service, and she was taken off her epidural and
placed on a Dilaudid PCA, which helped control the pain
significantly.  The patient was also seen and evaluated by
Inpatient Clinical Nutrition, which recommended goal tube
feeds, full strength, with fiber at 75 cc an hour for 24
hours.  Tube feeds were not started at this time.  By
postoperative day 2, the patient was still complaining of a
lot of pain.  Cardiopulmonary function was good.  Her oxygen
was weaned commissurately.  Her J-tube was putting out
minimal drainage.  Her G-tube was putting out bilious
drainage, and she was placed on Protonix for prophylaxis.
Due to the patient's extensive psychiatric history, the
patient was seen and evaluated by Psychiatry staff, which
recommended continuation of lorazepam 1 mg IV t.i.d. to
prevent any withdrawal of previous benzodiazapine use.  They
also recommended holding her Paxil, Seroquel, Klonopin, and
Valium, and to restart the Paxil and Seroquel once the
patient was in a more familiar setting without any mental
confusion that may have been presently resolved.

The patient continued to do well in the SICU and was
transferred to the floor by postoperative day 3.  Her only
complaints were still fair amount of abdominal pain, and she
had not passed any flatus nor been out of bed at that time.
The patient was also noticed to be slightly hypertensive, and
her Lopressor was increased to 50 mg q.6h., and a PT/OT
consult was obtained.  Her mental status was waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] with episodes of delirium during this time.  It was
determined to be most likely due to opiate analgesia.  The
patient was continued to be monitored for any benzodiazepine
withdrawal or opioid overdose.  The patient's tube feeds were
started on postoperative day 3, which she tolerated without
any difficulty.  By postoperative day 4, the patient had been
up and out of bed and appeared to be doing well, with her
pain controlled adequately on the morphine PCA.  The patient
was scheduled to have a swallowing study done in the next
couple of days.  By postoperative day 5, the patient's tube
feeds were at goal.  She was tolerating this without any
difficulty.

On postoperative day 6, the patient had an acute mental
status change where she was unresponsive to verbal or sternal
rub.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the health
officers where she was found to be responsive to loud voices
and withdrew to painful stimuli.  This change in mental
status quickly passed, and she was alert and oriented, but
her speech was still sluggish.  The results of this patient
were transferred to the Trauma SICU for further monitoring.
At this time, the patient's vital signs were stable.
Temperature was 96.8, blood pressure 148/110, heart rate 120,
respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute at 97 percent on 2
liters.  The patient had chest CT done at this time, which
showed left lower lobe opacity, which was most likely
atelectasis, but infectious process could not be ruled out at
this time.  A repeat chest CT the following day showed a
decrease in size of the left lower lobe opacity and was
continued to be followed through x-rays and physical exam.

In the Trauma SICU, the patient did very well and did not
need to be intubated at this time.  The patient underwent a
bedtime swallowing study on the 24th, which indicated that
the patient was not demonstrating any overt signs of
aspiration.  Their recommendations were to advance the
patient to a regular-consistency diet and thin liquids.

On [**2183-2-25**], the patient's NG tube was removed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] after the patient underwent a [**Known lastname **] bowel follow
through.  The [**Known lastname **] bowel follow through indicated no
evidence of anastomotic leaks and a slight decrease in
transit time through the distal anastomosis.  The patient was
restarted on Impact with fiber at three-quarter strength at
20 cc an hour, which she tolerated with a slight amount of
cramping, but no abdominal distension.  The patient continued
to do very well in the Trauma ICU and was transferred to the
floor on [**2183-2-27**], which was postoperative day 9.  On this
day, the patient's Foley was removed and her JP drains were
removed as well.
