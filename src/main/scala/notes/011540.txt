History of Present Illness:
38 year old male without significant medical history, who is

hypotension.  The patient says that beginning 3-4 days ago he
noted general malaise and a flu-like prodrome.  He still felt
well enough to play basketball 3 nights ago, however on the
morning before yesterday he noted progressive fevers, chills,
low back pain, and cough.  His cough was productive, and on the
morning prior to admission it became blood tinged.  He denies
hematuria.  His shortness of breath progressed, and at 1 a.m. on
the morning of admission his wife drove him to the [**Name (NI) **] ED.
.
At [**Hospital1 **], vitals on arrival were T 98.0, P 97, BP 91/57, 97% on
RA.  He had a CXR which demonstrated bilateral infiltrates and
he was given levofloxacin and 3 liters of normal saline.
Influenza A and B swab were both negative.  Labs were notable
for acute renal failure.  Given the lack of ICU beds, he was
transferred to our ED.
.
On arrival to our ED, vitals were T 99.7, HR 106, BP 98/53, RR
36, 96% on 4L, moving to a non-rebreather.  He received 6L of
NS, as well as azithromycin and ceftriaxone.  Blood cultures x 2
were sent.  He was sent to the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, his O2 sat was noted to drop
precipitously when switched from [**Hospital1 597**] to NC (nurse [**First Name (Titles) 70145**] [**Last Name (Titles) 597**]
at 89%).  ABG done shortly after arrival was 7.45/29/92.
Central venous O2 sat 75%.
.
Of note, his two children had viral URIs last week.  Review of
systems negative for hematuria, hematochezia.  He did have left
sided chest pressure yesterday, which has resolved.  He has
slight pain in his rib cage with deep inspiration.  He also had
mild abdominal pain and mild diarrhea yesterday.  In terms of
risk factors, he is sexually active with his wife, without
extramarital sexual intercourse.  He has not had sexual
intercourse with prostitutes.  He does not use IV drugs, and
does not smoke or drink alcohol.  He had an HIV test for a life
insurance policy a couple of years ago that was negative and
hasn't had another since.  He notes that he did have liposuction

.
CXR: Satisfactory placement of left PICC line. No pneumothorax.
Left lower lobe consolidation again identified. Right basilar
opacification representing atelectasis vs. aspiration vs.
infiltrate.
.
CHEST CT: Near complete consolidation of the left lower lobe
consistent with lobar pneumonia. Patchy opacities are also
present in the right lower lobe that may represent patchy
consolidation related to pneumonia and/or atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
38M, previously healthy, with pneumonia and sepsis due to
Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Pneumonia with sepsis:  Pt was admitted to the ICU with a RIJ
line placed in the ED. Pt was aggressively hydrated with IVF and
received oxygen by non-rebreather mask. Pt was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics (azithromycin and ceftriaxone). His sputum
cultures grew gram positive cocci, and blood cultures drawn at
[**Hospital 5871**] hospital grew Strep pneumoniae in [**3-10**] bottles. Abx
coverage was narrowed and then changed to po levofloxacin to
complete a 14 day course. Pt stabilized with no fevers, able to
ambulate with SpO2 >90% on room air, with prn cough syrup and
combivent for symptom control. He was given influenza and
polyvalent pneumococcal vaccines before discharge from the
hospital. He will see his PCP within the next month to check
that he is recovering, sooner if any problems.

Oral herpes: On the morning of discharge, pt reported developing
labial sores similar to previous herpetic lesions and requested
a prescription for Valtrex.

Pre-hypertension: After his sepsis had resolved, his blood
pressures were noted in the 130s-150 systolic. If this persists,
he may need antihypertensive Rx, but would not
