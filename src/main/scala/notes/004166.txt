History of Present Illness:
62 yo woman with MS (non-verbal), chronic vent [**Hospital 105385**]
transferred from rehab ([**Hospital3 672**]) with potassium of 7.2.
She was given kayexelate and calcium gluconate 2 amps then
transferred here. Potassium here 3.9. She was found to be
febrile to 101.2. Of note she had a midline placed yesterday.
Per her daughters this was to treat a urinary tract infection,
which she gets frequently. At baseline her daughters report she
interacts with them by nodding yes or no. She does this about
80% of the time when she is at her best.
.ROS: Per her daughters she has been more drowsy the past few
days, and may have had fever yesterday. They deny any diarrhea,
change in vent secretions, known change in sacral decubs, or
recent epidemics at her facility. She was noted to be in a room
with a patient colonized with VRE so had to be moved.

CXR [**12-3**] - In comparison with the study of [**12-2**], the right IJ
catheter has been removed and replaced with a right subclavian
line that extends to the lowest portion of the superior vena
cava. Again, the cardiac silhouette is displaced to the right.
Some increased opacification at the right base is consistent
with partial collapse. Tracheostomy tube remains in place
.
Renal US - [**11-29**] - Multiple renal stones bilaterally. No
evidence of gross hydronephrosis. Bladder is poorly visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo woman with MS who presented from [**Hospital **] rehab with
hyperkalemia, now with fever, elevated lactate.
.
# Fever: Multiple possible sources, given elevated lactate
concerning for sepsis though BP relatively stable, not
tachycardic, normal WBC. Urine culture from OSH positive for
Proteus and Serratia, cefepime sensitive UTI although the
patient has a chronic indwelling foley difficult so this could
be colonization. CXR significant for RRL collapse, likely
complicated by a PNA. Underwent Bronchoscopy on [**11-30**] and had
thick secretions suctioned. The following day
