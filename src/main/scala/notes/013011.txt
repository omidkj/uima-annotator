Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

2. Bilateral chest tubes

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 year old Russsian speaking man with
coronary artery disease, decreased LV function without prior
symptoms of congestive heart failure, hypertension, and atrial
fibrillation (on coumadin) status post pacemaker and a recent
diagnosis of malignant ascites (non small cell CA vs.
adenocarcinoma), primary unknown who presents with  hypoxia at

having increased dyspnea over the past two to three days which
was associated with a mild increase in pedal edema and a large
increase in his abdominal ascites.

SX, HA, dizziness, myalgias, arthralgias, F/C.  He had mild
abdominal pain, decreased appetite, mild nausea without emesis.

and has been relatively immobile.

WBC-3000* RBC-[**Numeric Identifier 2596**]* POLYS-2* LYMPHS-43* MONOS-55*

Imaging:
[**11-15**] RUQ U/S:
A stable appearance of the liver. The portal vein is patent and
demonstrates hepatopedal flow. 2. Cholelithiasis is again noted.
3. Moderate amount of ascites. A spot was marked for
paracentesis to be performed by the clinical staff. 4. The right
pleural effusion.

[**11-15**] CXR:
Interval redevelopment of moderately large left-sided pleural
effusion. Increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with
atelectasis, effusion, or consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Shortness of breath/Malignant Pleural Effusion/Pulmonary
Embolism: The patient was ROMI with negative enzymes x 3.  A
paracentesis was performed that resulted in mild improvement of
symptoms.  The patient was assessed by interventional
pulmonology and thoracic surgery and the decision was made to
defer thoracentesis and proceed with a VATS.  The patient had a
left sided VATS with biopsy and pleurodesis on [**11-20**].  He
tolerated the procedure well but required several boluses of
fluid rafter the procedure for low UOP and BP.  He also spiked a
fever to 101.5 and had low oxygen sats with increasing oxygen
requirement.  Overnight he was triggered for hypotension with a
BP of 102/60 (down from 120s-160s in the PACU) and had an
episode of desaturation to 85% on FiO2 50% FM + 4L NC in
addition to tachypnia.  The patient's O2 requirement continued
to increase until he required a NRB.  An IP consult was obtained
that recommended transfer to the MICU for management of ? Talc
pneumonitis versus pulmonary edema (as seen on CXR and with
effusions visualized on U/S).
In the MICU the patient had a right chest tube and R subclavian
line placed.  An [**11-21**] echo was positive for right atrium and
ventricle dilitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation suggestive of
possible PE.  A [**11-21**] CTA was positive for &#8220;Extensive
pulmonary emboli, particularly in the right lung, the largest in
the proximal portion of the pulmonary artery to the right upper
lobe. Small subsegmental pulmonary artery embolism in the left
lingula. Right middle lobe consolidation may reflect pulmonary
infarction, or consolidation.  A [**11-21**] LENI was positive for
left superficial deep vein thrombus.  Troponins were found to be
elevated to 0.17 and thought to be secondary to increased heart
strain.  Anticoagulation with IV heparin was started.  The
patient was started empirically on a course of flagyl and
levofloxacin. During his stay the patient's oxygen requirement
slowly diminished.
The family declined the option of placing an IVC filter. On the
floor the patient was kept anticoagulated with a heparin SS and
transitioned to lovenox on discharge.  His chest tube was pulled
prior to discharge.
.
2. Malignancy of unknown origin: During his stay the patient was
evaluated by hematology/oncology, who determined that further
characterization would be required with an outpatient PET/CT on
[**12-2**].  The patient has a [**12-4**] followup appointment with
thoracic oncology at which point his PET/CT will be reviewed and
a plan for further treatment will be made.
.
3. ARF:   The patient had an episode of ARF with creatinine
elevated to 2.1 from baseline of 1.2.  This was thought to be
secondary to third spacing and poor po intake of fluids
resulting in decreased intravascular volume.  With hydration and
encouragement of PO intake his creatinine returned to 0.9.
.
4. Anemia: Patient iron labs sent, determined to have low iron
and low TIBC consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
.
5. Afib: Coumadin held at first for procedure, heparin SS after
VATS.  Pt. dischraged on lovenox.
.
6. BPH: patient on terazosin.
7. GERD: Maalox, pantoprazole.
8. Ascites: 3.5 drained upon admission, sterile. Repeated day of
discharge for palliation, an additional 5L removed.
