Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, tachycardia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] is a 49 yo M with achondroplasia, HTN, spinal
stenosis, chronic lymphedema transferred from [**Hospital3 4107**]
for CTA to further evalaute acute onset of dyspnea and
tachycardia.

He has been admitted at [**Hospital3 **] where he has been
treated for bilateral lower extremity and gluteal cellulitis as
well as stage II sacral decubitus ulcer.  He was initially
treated with Ancef IV for his cellulitis and then changed to
Vancomycin 1gm IV Q12 given h/o penicillin allergy.  He was also
noted to have Stage II decubitus ulcer, was evaluated by surgery
who recommended continuing local wound care.  He was started on
lopressor 25mg [**Hospital1 **] for SBP's in 180's.  On the morning of [**8-9**] he
developed sinus tachycardia, no acute change on EKG and
desaturated to 88%.  He had a Ddimer that was slightly elevated
at 322.  He was unable to have CTA at [**Hospital3 4107**] [**3-7**]
difficulty placing appropriate bore IV.  Unable to have V/Q scan
due to spatial constraints.  He was started empirically on
lovenox 100mg sq q12 and transferred.

On transfer he was alert and oriented x 3 however during the
course of his ED stay he had acute change in mental status.  ABG
with pH 7.21 CO2 92 O2 102 HCO3 39, he was intubated with post
intubation ABG of 7.35 66 162 38.

UA: negative

One sputum cx grew MRSA

Imaging:
.
[**2133-8-11**] CT Head: Somewhat limited by motion without evidence of
ICH.
.
[**8-20**] CXR:
As compared to the previous examination, there is a minimal
decrease of the signs indicative of overhydration. Otherwise,
the radiograph is unchanged, except for interval removal of the
left-sided central venous access line.
.
[**8-12**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall systolic function is good (LVEF >40%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. The aortic valve is not well seen. No
definite aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
IMPRESSION: Technically suboptimal study. Normal left
ventricular cavity size and good global systolic function. Mild
right ventricular cavity enlargement with borderline normal free
wall systolic function.
.
CTA [**8-11**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus to the lobar level.
2. An endotracheal tube lies 1 cm above the carina.
3. Bilateral patchy consolidative changes may represent
atelectasis, edema or aspiration pneumonia as secretions are
noted in the airways.
.
ECG [**8-10**]: sinus tach at 110. RAD. LVH. TW flattening in inf
leads.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] is a 49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE
lymphedema with recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis
c/b tachycardia, dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure
requiring intubation.  Pt with [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course below:

#1 Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Altered Mental Status -
unclear inciting cause for acute hypercarbia in the ED which
prompted intubation, ddx included pulmonary embolism although
CTA with no evidence of large PE.  Other considerations included
pulmonary edema, PNA.  We treated for 8d with broad spectrum abx
for PNA largely due to heavy secretions.  We had no pathogen.
We also diuresed and afterload reduced as we believed diastolic
dysfunction led to resp failure.  He was a difficult wean off
the vent due to likely underlying obstructive lung disease, low
tidal volumes, and heavy secretions.  Finally, on [**8-18**] am we
felt prepared to extubate so checked cuff leak.  It was negative
so we gave decadron x2 doses to reduce airway edema.  On morning
of [**8-19**] he coughed the tube out and self-extubated.  He
tolerated this well and remained off the vent.  We kept him in
unit for >24h s/p extubation and had ABG which was reassuring
prior to transfer.  He still has some heavy secretions but
otherwise we feel he was adequately diuresed and treated for ?
PNA.
.
Floor course - pt being titrated down o2, assessing for OSA/OHA
first with trial of CPAP, but since awaiting placement and
relatively stable - monitoring o2 sat cont at night to document
drop.  Pt will need sleep study as outpatient.
.
#2 Bilateral LE cellulitis - unclear if new cellulitis or just
chronic stasis in setting of lymphedema.  No WBC or fever at
OSH, unclear if appearance has changed since IV abx.  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
treated with long course vanco with resolution of his
cellulitis.

Floor course - off abx, doing well/afebrile.
.
#Hypertension - [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] afterload reduced and used beta blocker for
HTN control, continued on floor.
