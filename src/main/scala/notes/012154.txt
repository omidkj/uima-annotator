Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, transfer for ST elevations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation and extubation
Mechanical ventilation
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 72067**] is an 89 year old female with severe asthma, HTN,
HL, DM, and CAD who was admitted to the MICU due to acute SOB
and ST elevations. She is now being transferred to the floor.

She has frequent exacerbations of her asthma and was recently
treated at [**Hospital3 **] for a COPD/asthma exacerbation. She
was discharged home and developed acute SOB, diaphoresis, and
HTN in the ambulance. Her ECG at the time showed ST elevations
in the lateral wall and she was given NTG, lasix, ASA, and taken
back to [**Location (un) **]. She was found to be hypoxic and agitated and
intubated for airway protection. She was then started on a nitro
gtt and heparin gtt due to ST elevations and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was found to be hypertensive to 225/118 and
was admitted to the MICU on versed and a heparin gtt (nitro gtt
had been weaned off due to downtrending BPs). In the MICU, she
was noted to have diffuse ST elevations and a code STEMI was
called. She was taken to the cath lab and found to have no
flow-limiting lesions but elevated filling pressures and was
felt to have Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy with an estimated EF
40%. She was diuresed in the MICU with 40mg IV lasix and also
given insulin and D50 for hyperkalemia.

Her course was also complicated by agitation and the patient
pulling out her PICC line and EJ IV access. She was also hitting
and scratching the nurses this morning and was given haldol 2mg
IM x 1 at 5:30am with excellent calming effect. She also had
hypernatremia and was given 1L D5W yesterday. She currently has
no IV access and has not had labs drawn since yesterday. She was
switched from IV beta blocker to oral this morning.

Currently she states that she is mildly short of breath but
feeling much better than previous. She has no other complaints,
other than wanting to go home.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She denies any headaches, confusion, chest
pain, palpitations, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, or urinary symptoms. She has a foley
catheter in place.

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- Diabetes
- s/p thyroid surgery
- h/o severe asthma, no PFTs in our system, recently on steroid
taper
- h/o CRI
- h/o blood clot in the leg several years ago

Social History:
States she smoked 1ppd x most of her life, cannot give quit date
history (once she said [**2119**], once she said 1 month ago). Denies
EtOH use. Denies other drug use. Lives alone in [**Location (un) **], MA and has
a sister in NC. Had one daughter who passed away recently from
asthma exacerbation.

Family History:
OSH transfer note states that she has a family history of
premature CAD and that both her parents are deceased. SHe states
that parents died of old age and "a natural death." She has 2
sisters who are in NC but she doesn't know about their health.

Studies:

CT Head [**2151-7-26**] : No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.

CXR [**2151-7-28**]:As compared to the previous examination, there is no
relevant change. Due to projection effect, the cardiac
silhouette appears slightly larger than before. However, no
evidence of pulmonary edema is seen.  Moderate tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity
suggesting pneumonia. No pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.

TTE [**2151-7-27**]: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction suggested with distal septal and apical hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2149-7-15**], a mild regional wall motion abnormality
is now seen suggestive of CAD.

CARDIAC CATH [**2151-7-26**]: 1. Coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed no significant coronary artery disease.
The LMCA appeared normal. The LAD, LCx, and RCA had minor
luminal irregularities with marked tortuosity. 2. Limited
resting hemodynamics demonstrated low-normal systemic arterial
blood pressure (SBP 109 mm Hg). There was no gradient upon
pullback of the catheter from the LV into the aorta.
3. Left ventriculography revealed marked distal anterior,
apical, and
distal inferoapical severe hypokinesis/ akinesis with
contraction of the basal segments, with an estimated LVEF of
40%. There was no mitral regurgitation.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No significant angiographically apparent coronary artery
disease.
2. Marked LV apical dysfunction consistent with Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy.

RUE Ultrasound [**2151-7-29**]: No evidence of DVT of the right upper
extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old female with dCHF, HTN and severe asthma requiring
recurrent ED visits currently on prednisone taper, transferred
from OSH with respiratory distress intubated for airway
protection and ECG changes now s/p clean cardiac
catheterization.

#. Respiratory distress: Patient has had recurrent exacerbations
of COPD vs asthma requiring repeated treatment with steroids.
She carries diagnosis of asthma and smoked 1 pack per week in
past and has been on spiriva. She improved rapidly with steroids
IV which were transitioned to oral. There was no documentation
of hypercapnia or hypoxia prior to intubation so unclear if she
actually had respiratory failure or was just intubated for
airway protection given ECG changes. Wheezing and air mo
