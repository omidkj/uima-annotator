RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2142-8-20**] 8:06 AM
Reason: asses pneumonia/effusion
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
56 year old woman s/p left lower lobectomy with PNA, s/p
intubation for resp failure, ?aspiration
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
asses pneumonia/effusion
AP CHEST, 8:47 A.M. [**8-20**].
HISTORY: Left lower lobectomy. Intubated. Respiratory failure.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-15**] through 10:
Lung volumes are smaller today than yesterday, accounting for
increase in the radiodensity of predominantly dependent
pulmonary edema but shifted to the left. Tracheostomy tube and
right internal jugular line are in standard placements. No
pneumothorax.
CArdiac Echo- [**2142-8-11**]
Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
2. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
moderate
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
7. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-5-28**],
RV and LV  function has decreased.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2142-8-11**] 10:59 AM
Reason: w/u for DVT s/p acute desat. and resp. arrest
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
56 year old woman with acute desat ? DVTs
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
w/u for DVT s/p acute desat. and resp. arrest
INDICATION: 56-year-old female with acute desaturation.
COMPARISONS: None.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial
femoral, popliteal, and calf veins performed. In the proximal
right common femoral vein, a small focus of echogenic material
is seen along the posterior venous wall, consistent with a small
nonocclusive thrombus. Normal compressibility, augmentation,
flow, and waveforms were demonstrated throughout. No echogenic
thrombus is seen within the remaining vascular structures.
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic material along the posterior wall of the right
common femoral vein consistent with nonocclusive thrombus,
likely not acute.
2. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis within the left lower
extremity.

Misc- Radiology results:
CT Head w/o contrast: acute sinusitis
    CTA CHEST: neg. PE, b/l effusions, R. breast mass (need f/u
[**Last Name (un) 3907**]), stenotic SVC
    Liver/GB u/s: fatty liver
    B/L LENI: Echogenic material posterior wall R. common
femoral
              vein - nonocclusive thrombus.
    Echo: LVEF mildly depressed, mod. R. wall hypokinesis, 2+

          regurg., trivial mitral regurg


Brief Hospital Course:
54F s/p completion VATS LLLobectomy for staple line recurrence
[**2142-7-23**], course complicated by: occassional desat r/t
secretions/ activity intolerance, bronchoscopy x1 for secretion
clearance, Afib- treated w/ Amiodarone, HIT -neg, and
transfusion of 2u PRBC post-op. Patient d/c'd to rehab [**2142-8-2**].
Patient  readmitted [**8-4**] w/ pneumonia, resp distress, +/- ms
changes.
Patient presented to ED with SOB and increase in O2 requirement,
then intubated. Bronchoscopy done w/ BAL: gram + cocci in pairs
and clusters, started on antibiotics. Patient extubated on [**8-5**]
and transferred to floor [**8-6**].

REsp- On floor patient required aggressive pulmoonary toilet and
CPT as tolerated w/ fair outcome. [**8-9**] transferred back to ICU
