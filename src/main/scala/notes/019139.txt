Chief Complaint:
Resp failure & hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Extubation
Thoracentesis
Breast biopsy


History of Present Illness:
52 yo f with history of DM on insulin and HTN who has been
feeling generally unwell for months.  She has been coughing up
sputum and more trouble breathing for the past few months.  She
has been having so much trouble breathing that she has been
unable to eat or drink for the past few days to a week; this
prompted her to call 911 this am.  One son thinks that she may
have been having intermittent fevers.  They were unaware of any
weight loss.  The note that she avoids seeing the doctor.

In the ED, she was found to be in respiratory distress and quite
hypoxic.  Initial VS were 97.9 94 135/94 24 98% on NRB.  She was
found to have a large breast mass and decreased breath sounds on
the right on exam.  She eventually required intubation for
hypoxia.  The intubation was complicated by the ETT being placed
in R main stem bronchus initially.  In the setting of
intubation, she became hypotensive to the 60s.  She was given 4L
of IVF and required levofed and Neosyn at one point.  Prior to
being transferred she was weaned down to levofed alone.  In the
setting of hypotension, she developed STE on EKG, which rapidly
resolved with improvement in BP.  Interventional cardiology was
called and evaluated the patient in the ED.  They did not
recommend any heparin or cardiac catheritization, but
recommended cycling CE, EKGs and an ECHO if she remains
unstable.
CT torso shows a complex, likely malignant effusion, lung mass
and breast mass;  In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] urgent femoral line was placed,
which was not done under completely sterile conditions.  In the
ED she was given levofloxacin 500mg IV x1 and CTX 1 gm IV x1 for
presumed PNA.  For hyperkalemia she was given Insulin D50,
Calcium chloride.  She was also hyponatremic, presumed
hypovolemic hyponatremia, butn not improved with NS boluses in
ED.  Her glucose is also elevated to 400s.  Her VS prior to
transfer are: 72 117/76 18 100%, A/C 450 x18 peep 5 60%.
