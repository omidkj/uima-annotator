lymphadenopathy and there was long concern of a potential
hematologic anomaly and, therefore, a biopsy was necessary.

x2 months)
2. ITP after viral syndrome [**10-2**], refractory to IVIG and
prednisone, s/p open splenectomy, fascial repair

hemorrhage, diabetes and obesity; mother with lung CA, heart
failure, diabetes and obesity; sister living with ITP.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 135/85, pulse 82, respirations 16 and O2
saturation 96% on room air.  On physical examination [**Known firstname **] was
casually dressed, pleasant and in no distress.  His skin was
warm, dry with no rashes. Sclerae were anicteric, conjunctiva
clear, pupils were equal round and reactive to light, fundi did
not demonstrate retinopathy, mucous membranes were moist, tongue
was pink, there was a [**Doctor First Name **]-like lesion left side lower buccal
mucosa and the oropharynx was essentially clear of exudates or
hyperemia.  Trachea is in the midline and the neck was supple
with full range of motion, no adenopathy, thyromegaly or carotid
bruits, no JVD.  Chest was symmetric and there was a well healed
left thoracotomy and sub-costal incision scars, lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally with good air movement.  Cardiac
exam
was regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  The abdomen was obese but soft and non-tender,
non-distended with positive bowel sounds with large ventral
hernia and likely second lower hernia more laterally.  There was
no spinal tenderness or flank pain.  Lower extremities were
noted
for bilateral venous stasis dermatitis left greater than right
with no ulcerations and tense 1+ edema.  There was no evidence
of
joint swelling or inflammation of the joints.  There were no
focal neurological deficits except for decreased sensation in
the
lower legs/feet/toes, gait appeared normal.

[**2158-6-14**]
SPECIMEN #1: LIVER, NEEDLE CORE BIOPSY (A).
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Moderate portal/septal and mild periportal and lobular
mononuclear inflammation.
2.  Multiple lobular and single portal non-necrotizing
granulomas.
3.  Minimal steatosis without ballooning or hyalin.
4.  No bile duct injury or loss is identified.
5.  Trichrome stain shows increased portal fibrosis with
established septa formation, bridging, and focal complete nodule
formation (Stage 4 fibrosis).
6.  GMS, PAS-D, and AFB stains are negative for organisms.
Note:  The finding of lobular and portal non-necrotizing
granulomas raises the possibility of an infectious process
versus an idiopathic systemic granulomatous disease such as
sarcoidosis

SPECIMEN #2: LYMPH NODE, MESENTERIC (B-C).
DIAGNOSIS
NONCASEATING GRANULOMATOUS LYMPHADENITIS. SEE NOTE

[**2158-6-19**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Moderate amount of free fluid and
free gas in the abdomen. The patient is  day five post-repair of
incisional hernia and gastric band placement. The amount of free
fluid and gas within the abdomen is not expected at this stage
of the postoperative course. A site of perforation cannot be
identified on this suboptimal examination.

[**2158-6-24**] Liver US :
Limited study without evidence of cholelithiasis or secondary
findings to suggest acute cholecystitis.
