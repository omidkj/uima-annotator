RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2109-7-15**] 10:05 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man s/p mvr/cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after mitral valve
replacement and CABG.

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2109-7-10**].

The cardiac size is mildly enlarged but stable. The
post-sternotomy wires are unchanged. The calcified aortic arch
is again noted. There is no congestive heart failure or new
consolidations. Fibronodular opacities in both apices, left
significantly more than right are unchanged and most likely
represent previous granulomatous exposure.

Small bilateral pleural effusion is grossly unchanged. There is
no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: No significant change.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2109-7-14**]  8:40:00 AM


Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Right axis
deviation. Probable rate dependent left bundle-branch block.
Compared to
prior tracing of [**2109-7-11**] two QRS morphologies are now seen,
possibly secondary
to a rate-related phenomenon. There are no other diagnostic
interim changes.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo contrast
in the LAA.
No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity.
Severely depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid
anteroseptal - hypo; septal apex - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Focal calcifications in
ascending
aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.


AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild to
moderate ([**11-27**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure. The patient appears to be
in sinus
the patient.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is
present in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial
appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is globally
severely depressed (LVEF= 35 %) with focalities in mid and
apical septal wall.
4. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is mild
global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
5. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is
not present. Mild to moderate ([**11-27**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a
mild posterior leaflet restriction.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass:

LVEF 20% on milrinone and epinephrine.
RV function is similar to pre CPB.
There is no residual mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis.
There is a ring
in the mitral position, stable and functioning well.
Mild to moderate AI.
Aortic contour is intact

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71362**] was admitted a couple days prior to surgery
secondary to being on Coumadin and requiring pre-operative
work-up. He discontinued his Coumadin approximately 5 days prior
to admission and was started on Heparin on day of admission.
During his pre-operative period he was worked-up in the usual
manner. On [**7-8**] he
