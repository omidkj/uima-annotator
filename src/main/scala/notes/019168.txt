History of Present Illness:
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**] operative note as follows:
65-year-
old male who was noted to have elevated liver function tests.
A CT scan of the chest and abdomen was obtained demonstrating
a large mass in the right lobe of the liver and a CT-guided
biopsy demonstrated hepatocellular carcinoma. A CT of the
chest and abdomen at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-8**] demonstrated a 4.9 x
10.6 x 10.4 cm mass involving the right lobe of the liver and
the medial segment of the left lobe (segments 4, 5, and 8)
which demonstrates washout on delayed images and exerts mass
effect on the portal vein branches without any clear
thrombosis or invasion. There was no ascites and the liver
contour appeared smooth. There was no evidence of portal
hypertension. The bone scan was negative. Hepatitis B
serology was negative. AFP was 21. He subsequently underwent
portal vein embolization in preparation for a right hepatic
trisegmentectomy. He subsequently became jaundiced and
underwent ERCP for compression of the biliary tree secondary
to the tumor mass. He has otherwise remained stable. He is
now brought to the operating room after informed consent was
obtained for right hepatic trisegmentectomy, cholecystectomy,
and intraoperative ultrasound.


Past Medical History:
PMH hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, peripheral
neuropathy, and benign colonic polyps.

PSH: trauma to his left hand requiring repair of his middle and
ring finger in [**2168**], and bilateral wrist carpal tunnel syndrome
in [**2169**] requiring surgical correction
R portal vein embolization [**2174-3-22**]
[**2174-4-22**] Right hepatic trisegmentectomy, cholecystectomy,
intraoperative ultrasound.


Social History:
diabetic diet. He has a history of significant alcohol
intake with approximately 21 drinks per week, but he quit in
[**2173-12-17**]. He has a history of smoking but quit 30 years ago.

He has an occasional social cigarette. He has no history of IV
drug use, marijuana use, blood transfusions, tattoos, hepatitis,

or piercing. married and has two children. He is a retired

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2174-4-22**], patient underwent right hepatic trisegmentectomy,
cholecystectomy, with intraoperative ultrasound for HCC. Surgeon
was Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Please refer to operative note for
details. Postop, he was transferred to the SICU for management.
Postop course was long and complicated with sequelae from liver
that was small for size. He developed recurrent ascites
requiring intermittent paracentesis, jaundice and confusion.
Hospital course was further complicated by acute renal failure
with persistently elevated creatine levels. Patient also
developed several episodes of melena requiring mulitple
transfusions to stabilize his HCT levels. During hospital course
patient required mulitple ICU stays. LFTs remained elevated
during entire hospital course, especially alkaline phosphatase
and bilirubin levels. Worsening renal function was noted with
rising BUN and Cr. Patient ultimately expired on POD123 due to
multiple episodes of bradycardia with decreased O2 saturation
and ultimately respiratory failure.

Significant events during hospital course are as follows:

He was found to have thrombosis of the main portal vein, splenic
vein and superior mesenteric vein on [**5-1**]. IV heparin was
started. Head was negative for bleed or stroke. Rifaximin and
lactulose were started for prevention of encephalopathy. There
was an unsuccessful attempt to recanalize the portal vein due to
inability to advance a guidewire into the main portal vein. The
pleura was traversed upon percutaneous attemt at accessing the
portal vein. CXR within angio suite demonstrated no
pneumothorax.

Bile Leak: Due to rising bilirubin levels, patient underwent
ERCP on [**2174-6-7**], which showed that previously inserted stent had
migrated proximally into the CBD. This stent was removed. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 97186**] was seen. Injection of contrast showed disruption of
the biliary tree with extravasation of contrast into the liver
parenchyma.

Blood cultures were positive for enterococci on [**5-9**], so patient
was started on vancomycin and continued through [**5-24**]. Subsequent
blood cultures were negative. Urine culture from [**5-10**] grew yeast
and patient received fluconazole from [**Date range (1) 22229**]. Repeat urine
cultures on [**6-9**] were positive for VRE, and patient was started
on linezolid.

Pleural Effusion: CXR on [**8-3**] was significant for R pleural
effusion. Right pigtail catheter was placed and drained 2L of
serosanguinous fluid. Pigtail catheter was left to suction and
removed when drainage had subsided. Fluid was sent for analysis
and did not reveal any signs of infection or active bleeding.
Despite catheter placement, subsequent CXRs demonstrated
persistence of the stable pleural effusion.

Melena: On [**2174-8-3**], patient began to have several episodes of
dark, melanotic stools. Blood pressure became more labile into
the 80-90s systolic, and HCT began to fall. Patient was
transfused pRBCs to maintain HCT, and patient was transferred to
the ICU. Melana continued periodically throughout the remainder
of hospital course, occasionally requiring additional
transfusions. During final week of hospital course, HCT remained
stable in the upper 20s, and melena stopped. EGD was performed
on [**2174-8-3**] that showed high risk esophageal varices, but these
were not felt to be the cause of the bleeding. Colonoscopy on
[**2174-8-3**] showed clot in the rectum, but no signs of active
bleeding.

SBP: Patient required multiple paracenteses during his hospital
course. On [**2174-7-25**], peritoneal fluid tested positive for MRSA.
Patient was started on Vancomycin.

Nutrition/physical therapy: Throughout long hospital course
patient's nutritional status declined. Tube feeds were on/off
throughout his course with attempts at using various formulas to
improve nutritional status. TPN was also used. PO intake was
continually encouraged, but patient was unable to take adequate
po nutrition. As patient remained in bed for such a long time,
he became progressively more deconditioned. Physical therapy was
consulted throughout the hospitalization to work with the
patient. As patient became weaker, he was unable to engage in
significant physical therapy exercises, and consequently became
more deconditioned.

On POD 122, patient began to have episodes of bradycardia, with
heart rates into the high 20s. These episodes were accompanied
by
