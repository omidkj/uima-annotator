Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Epinephrine / Amiodarone / Ambien

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to left
circumflex artery, balloon catheterization to OM branch


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25866**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for CAD s/p multiple PCIs most recently in [**4-21**], ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an LVEF 25-30%, PAF, and CVA transferred
from an OSH for cardiac catheterization after VF arrest. The
patient initially presented to OSH on [**2104-11-8**] with chest pain.
Per review of records, the chest pain woke him from sleep at 2
am described as [**8-22**] epigastric pain and did not improve with SL
NTG. He then was taken to an OSH ED, where he was found to be in
atrial fibrillation with RVR with lateral STD. While in the OSH
ED, he developed [**11-22**] left-sided chest pain different from
intial chest pain that resolved with NTG and morphine.  His labs
at that time were notable for elevated cardiac biomarkers to CK
42, MB 3.1, TnT 0.22.  Cardiology was consulted with
recommendation for cardiac catheterization.  Prior to
catheterization, however, the patient had VF arrest on [**11-10**] with
ROSC after defibrillation x2, CPR, calcium, and amiodarone.  At
that point, the patient was started on heparin gtt, integrillin
gtt, and taken to cardiac catheterization. Cardiac
catheterization demonstrated 60% proximal and mid-LAD, 80-90%
LCx, 100% proximal RCA, some in-stent resteonsis of OM with IABP
placed. CT surgery was consulted for possible CABG, which the
family deferred pending transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
and repeat cardiac catheterization.  Of note, the patient
received 4 units PRBCs at OSH for a hct of 28.7.  In addition,
the patient was also admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-20**] for chest
pain that resolved without intervention.
.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably without
complaints. Denies CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA,
palpitations, pain radiating to jaw, arms, or back.
.
ROS: As above, he denies change in weight or bowel habit, cough,
fever, arthralgias or myalgias. All other review of systems
negative.

PTCA COMMENTS:
initial angiography showed severe diffsue disease throughout the
LCX
system with new tight lesion just proximal to the stent placed
in [**Month (only) **]
[**2104**]. The OM branch (was treated with POBA in [**4-21**]) was also
diffusely
and severely diseased throughout. We planned to treat this with
PTCA and
stenting, if feasible.
A 6 French 4.0 XB guide provided adequate support. Heparin was
commenced
prophylactically. The patient also was receiving NTG gtt and the
IABP
was set on 1:1 with augmented BP of 140 mmHg and mean of 65
mmHg.
A ChoICE PT Extra Support wire crossed the lesion with minimal
manipulation and positioned into the distal AV groove LACX. The
proximal
LCX stent was predilated with a 2.5x12 mm Quantum Maverick RX at
12 ATM
x2 followed by deployment of a 2.5x15 mm Promus RX DES at 12
ATm,
postdilated with a 2.75x8 mm Quantum Maverick balloon at 22 ATM.

We then advanced the wire into the jailed OM branch and
performed
several POBAs starting with a 2.0x12 mm Voyager RX at 6-12 ATM
followed
by 2.76x15 mm Quantum maverick balloon (at 6-8 ATM), each left
up for
30-45 seconds.
Final angiography showed excellent flow into the LCX system with
0%
residual stenosis within the stent and 40% residual stenosis in
the OM
branch (due to rapid recoil). No apparent dissection or distal
emboli.
The IABP was then adjusted under flouroscopy 9advande 3 cm).
The patient left the cath lab free from angina and in stable
condition.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25866**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCIs most recently in [**4-21**],
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF 25%, PAF, and [**Hospital **]
transferred from an OSH for cardiac catheterization after VF
arrest.  Underwent cardiac cath with DES to LCx proximal to
prior stent, but etiology of VF arrest unclear, possible
ischemic vs. prolonged QT from Citalopram.
.
# Coronaries: Patient with severe CAD s/p CABG with OSH
diagnostic cardiac catheterization demonstrating possible
in-stent restenosis of OM 1 after recent PCI with in-hospital VF
arrest at OSH concerning for ischemic event.  Underwent cardiac
cath here with DES to LCx proximal to prior stent, 60% LAD and
100% RCA not intervened on.  Unclear if LCX lesion led to
arrhythmias. Had IABP which was removed following cath.  Being
discharged on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], BB, statin, Moexipril (home ACEi).
.
# Pump: Patient with known chronic systolic CHF with LVEF
25-30%.  Was euvolemic with minimal pulmonary vascular
congestion on CXR and minimal signs of volume overload on exam.
Continued on home metoprolol, Lasix with goal -500-even in-house
and discharged on home Lasix dose.  Discharged on BB, digoxin,
Moexipril.
.
# Rhythm: Patient with a history of PAF with report of AF with
RVR on initial presentation although available ECGs demonstrate
sinus rhythmn.  Patient also with VF cardiac arrest at OSH, with
longest QTc recorded as 511 msecs prior to VF, 0.48 now
in-house.  Possible etiologies to VF arrest include ACS versus R
on T with prolonged QTc.  Celexa discontinued for ?QTc
prolongation and possible precipitant of VF.  DES to LCx as
above for possible ischemic component of VF.  Did not receive
Amiodarone as history of pulmonary toxicity.  Pt h
