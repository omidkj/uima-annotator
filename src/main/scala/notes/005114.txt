Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening abdominal pain, poor PO intake, worsening back pain,
right vision loss

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
00Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year old male with a history of
metastatic NSCLC with KRAS mutation, metastatic to bone.  He is
s/p Carboplatin and Pemetrexed [**Date range (3) 88828**], maintenance
Pemetrexed (s/p 5 cycles, POD [**2117-2-24**] CT), s/p DF/HCC protocol
11-302 randomized to the arm receiving GSK1120212 (an inhibitor
of MEK1/2 activation and kinase activity) and is also s/p
palliative radiation to low back for metastatic disease of the
vertebra.  He presents with increasing lower back pain despite
attempts to control with fentanyl patch and narcotics at home.
Previous PET scans have shown increased FDG avidity in the right
ischial tuberosity and left L5 vertebral body and pedicle
compatible with known metastases.  He has found the fentanyl,
oxycodone, and morphine that he has taken at home to be
ineffective.  He often feels better when he stands and walks,
and worse when he lies down.  Pain frequently radiates down his
legs.  His palliative radiation treatments started [**10-11**] of
this year.

He also presents with poor PO intake over the last several weeks
(he thinks he has lost 10 lbs over this time period) and a
burning, epigastric sensation after eating.  He denies vomiting
but states that his PO intake has decreased dramatically
secondary to the epigastric pain.  No diarrhea.

Otherwise, he also has discovered a progressive loss of vision
in his right eye.  Over the past week or so, he feels his right
eye has gotten increasingly blurry - he has never required
visual correction in the past.  He does not describe an acute
event but feels he's had a gradual loss over the week.  No pain
or erythema associated with this event.

Otherwise, review of systems is positive for a mildly productive
cough.  Denies fevers, chills.  No chest pain, chest pressure.

Pain was controlled in house with fentanyl patch and dialudid.
However, pt's respiration status got worse. Patiet had an
aspiration event following a bout of cough. Pt was initially
started on levo but zosyn was ordered as well. Pt had three
triggers for hypoxia and required 10L of face mask for some time
to maintain sats. MICU transfer was sought for worsening resp
status and nursing concern.

Past Medical History:
Stage 4 NSCLC c/b SVC syndrome (please refer to oncology
progress notes for full oncologic history), asthma,
osteoarthritis.

Past Surgical history:
[**2116-6-22**]: VATS with RUL biopsy and wedge resection of right lung
mass

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**12/2115**] developed hacking productive cough, [**4-/2116**] became
worse, occasional hemoptysis and Patient presented to [**Hospital3 35296**] Hospital ED where he underwent CXR [**2116-5-22**] revealing a
RUL mass lesion with central cavitation.
- OSH CT of the chest w/ contrast [**2116-5-22**]
2 RUL masses identified, one in the apical segment and the other
in the anterior segment.  The larger lesion measures 8 cm and
the
smaller lesion, 4 cm. There is extensive right hilar and
pericarinal adenopathy with circumferential compression of the
bronchus intermedius and RUL bronchus. The right main pulmonary
artery is compressed. Besides an isolated nonspecific 3 mm
nodule
in the LUL and extensive coronary artery calcifications, the
restof the chest is unremarkable. Note is also made of likely
adrenalhyperplasia.
- [**2116-6-22**] underwent OSH bronchoscopy showing fullness in the
area
bt the RUL and the right main stem bronchus near the carina with
initial biopsies nondiagnostic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 88829**]).
- [**2116-6-22**] OSH VATS with RUL biopsy and wedge resection of right
lung mass (4 X 2 X 1.5 cm fragmented lung tissue with soft
necrotic tumor mass that is about 2.5 cm in greatest diameter)
diagnosed as well-differentiated bronchoalveolar carcinoma (no
lymph nodes assessed, positive margins), EGFR mutation testing
byIHC, EGFR not detected
- [**2116-6-24**] Saw Dr. [**Known firstname 449**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 33667**], Oncologist, at [**Hospital 27034**]
Hospital in consultation for NSCLC but was unable to continue
following with him for insurance issues.
- [**2116-7-20**] Initial consultation with Radiation Oncology here, Dr.
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
- [**2116-8-13**] C1D1 of carboplatin and pemetrexed
- [**2116-8-25**] - [**2116-8-28**] admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] for cough-induced syncope
(EKG, cardiac enzymes, telemetry, TTE unremarkable).  IP
consulted and performed a R throacentesis on [**2116-8-28**] to
alleviate
severe cough.  Pleural fluid was + for malignant cells.
- Restaging PET/CT [**2116-10-13**]:
1. Interval decrease in the size and FDG uptake in the right
apical lung mass and right hilar mass.  Interval decrease in the
FDG avidity of the bony metastases. No new FDG avid bony
metastatic disease.
- Restaging MRI of the brain [**2116-10-13**]:
Unchanged size and appearance of enhancing small left frontal
lobe lesion corresponding to an area with a punctate
calcification seen on the recent head CT. These findings may be
related to a granuloma.
-Restaging PET CT [**2117-12-30**]:
Overall increase in FDG-avidity of known right lung mass, hilar
mass and subcarinal lymph node compatible with progression of
disease. Newly FDG-avid right infraclavicular lymph node and new
right ischial tuberosity FDG uptake

[**2117-4-1**] DF/HCC protocol 11-302 C1D1, randomized to
GSK1120212(MEK [**1-11**] inhibitor)
[**2117-4-15**] Dose reduction in GSK1120212 for grade II rash.
[**2117-6-24**] Off treatment portion of protocol 11-302 for POD on CT
torso [**2117-6-21**].
