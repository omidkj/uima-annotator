Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Removal of infected hemodialysis catheter
Temporary Hemodialysis Catheter Placement with Conversion to a
Tunneled Hemodialysis Catheter
Central Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
81 male with ESRD on HD, AFib, severe diverticulosis, C diff
colitis, klebsiella urosepsis, and CHF EF 60%, here with 2 days
of fatigue since last HD session. Per the wife's report, patient
had fevers and chills and one episode of urinary incontience at
home on the am of presentation. There has been no change in his
SOB or cough which have been stable for the past month. She
denies any episodes of vomiting, diarrhea, or complaints of
chest or abdominal pain. Wife reports patient as poor historian
due to "memory problems." She brought him to the ED this am
rather than going for the regularly scheduled hemodialysis.

Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 12908**]/08 for
tunnelled HD catheter placement and initiation of hemodialysis.
He had an AV fistula placed on [**2125-8-6**].

In the ED, VS T 99.9 BP 88/55 HR 90 RR 24-33 POx 86% on RA, 96%
on 4L. CXR showed LLL opacity concerning for atelectasis vs.
infiltrate. He received Vanc 1gm/zosyn 2.25gm/levo 250mg in the
ED. A Left IJ was placed and he received 500cc NS bolus with
normalization of his blood pressure to 130/70. A serum lactate
was 4.1. Blood and urine cultures were sent.

ROS: The patient denies any weight change, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia,
chest pain, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity oedema, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness,
focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

STUDIES:
[**2125-9-10**] - ECHOCARDIOGRAM
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular cavity size is mildly increased
with mild free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-10-25**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure and tricuspid
regurgitation are increased and right ventricular cavity
enlargement/free wall hypokinesis are now seen. This
constellation of findings is suggestive of c/w a primary
pulmonary process (chronic pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm,
COPD, etc.).
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2123**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
