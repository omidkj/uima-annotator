fever and altered mental status

Liver Biopsy
Placement of tunneled dialysis line
Dialysis
Placement and removal of central line


History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 yo M with  PMH of Afib (s/p AV nodal ablation &
[**First Name3 (LF) 4448**] implant '[**61**] @ replacement in '[**63**]), EF 30-35%,
myelofibrosis, and recurrent C. diff infections who presents
with fever and altered mental status. He notes that yesterday he
felt very "ill" but could not elaborate. His partner, [**Name (NI) **],
notes that he was very fatigued yesterday and was having dry
heaves last night as well as green emesis. Today she states that
he awoke and did not know where he was was. He was very
disoriented, so his partner called EMS, at which time the pt was
taken to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital.
.
At the OSH, the pt was noted to have a temp of 104 F. He had a
CT head which was negative there. He also received a liter of
NS, Vanc 1 gm IV x1, Levofloxacin 750 mg IV x1. His SBP dropped
to 85/31 so he was started on a dopamine gtt at 4mcg/hr. He also
received toradol 15 mg IVx 1. He was transferred here for
further care.
.
In the ED, his VS were: Tm 100.8, HR 74-90, BP 85-106/32-49, RR
16-20, Sat 97% 4L NC. He received 2 L NS. A triple lumen R groin
line was placed and he was started on a levophed gtt. CXR here
was negative for any new infiltrate. He was found to have
purulent discharge from the tunneled dialysis line, so
transplant surgery pulled the line in the ED after blood
cultures were obtained. He also received toradol 30 mg IV x1 and
gentamycin 80 mg IV x1. Per ED report here, the pt received 3%
NS for a Na level of 118 at OSH, however OSH records do not
appear to record this and his Na was 128 there.
.
Of note, the pt was recently hospitalized here from
[**Date range (3) 106200**] for viral gastroenteritis, and then CT
contrast-induced ATN. He had a tunnelled line placed in his L IJ
on [**2176-12-24**]. He also had a L groin pseudoanuerysm s/p femoral
temporary dialysis catheter removal. This was injected with
thrombin.
.
At this time, the pt has no complaints. He denies n/v, fevers,
chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, constipation, headache, or any other symptoms.

IMAGING
CXR
1. Interval placement of dual lumen left-sided IJ hemodialysis
catheter with tip in the distal SVC.
2. Interval development of hazy opacity overlying the right mid
and lower lung zone. This may be partially secondary to a
posterior layering pleural effusion. However, a right lower lung
zone early/developing pneumonia should also be considered.
Followup radiographs may be of benefit.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Bacteremia/Sepsis: Patient intially admitted to ICU from OSH.
The patient's HD line was pulled and it was expressing pus.
Blood cultures from the OSH showed MSSA and cultures from the
line tip also showed MSSA.  Patient was initially on levophed in
the ICU and he was supported with fluid boluses.  Pressors were
weaned off and his hypotension resolved.  He was called out to
the floor.  Blood cultures have been negative here.  A TTE did
not show evidence of vegitations.  A new HD line was placed
after surveillance cultures were negative and the patient was
afebrile.  He will complete a two week course of Vanc per HD
protocol.
.
# ESRD on dialysis: The patients renal failure is recent onset
from hypotension-induced ATN and CT contrast induced ATN during
his last hospitalization.  A new tunneled HD line was placed
during this admission and dialysis was continued.  As of this
date, there has not been any renal recovery.  Of note, he has
had difficulty taking his phosphate binders because of the size
of the pills.  His phosphate is not currently elevated but it
should be closely monitored as an outpatient.
.
#Left IJ clot - Patient has a clot in his left IJ, a site of
previous instumentation. He also intially had a left subclavian
clot that is now resolved.  He was maintained on a heparin gtt
while in the hospital, except for the period directly after his
liver biopsy.  He will be transitioned back to coumadin.
.
#Groin hematoma / Hip Pain - After removal of the patient's
femoral central line that was placed in the ED, he developed a
hematoma.  Intially there was a concern of another
pseudoaneurysm developing.  Repeat ultrasound was without
evidence of pseudoaneurysm, and there was no indication for
thrombin.  He continued to have pain at that sight.  It was
discussed with vasc [**Doctor First Name **] and pain is not atypical for a large
hematoma.  Plain films of the hip were obtained and discussed
with ortho, no acute process on film to account for pain.  He
had limited range of motion because of active pain.  Peripheral
pulses were intact in the leg and he intact sensation and [**4-7**]
strength in his foot.  His pain improved during the hospital
stay and he had improved range of motion.  He will continue
physical therapy as rehab.
.
#Increased LFTs - The source is not entirely clear.  Alkphos and
GGT elevated so likely from liver. Bilirubin also elevated
during the admission. Ultrasound x2 without evidence of ductal
dilation.
