CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old female
with longstanding diabetes mellitus and known cerebrovascular
accident who presented to an outside hospital for a two week
history of shortness of breath.  Tests performed in the
outside hospital revealed electrocardiogram changes in lead
2, 3 an AVF consistent with an inferior myocardial
infarction.  Laboratory data done at that time revealed an
elevated troponin at 16.7.  The patient did not complain any
of any chest pain, nausea, or arm tingling.  The patient was
transferred from the outside hospital to [**Hospital6 1760**] for a cardiac
catheterization.

1.  Diabetes mellitus.
2.  Pancreatitis.
3.  Hiatal hernia.
4.  Cardiovascular accident in [**2174**], two times in [**2177**].
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Status post cholecystectomy.
7.  Status post right breast lumpectomy.
8.  Status post right carotid artery endarterectomy.
9.  Depression.
10. Morbid obesity.
11. Congestive heart failure.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Insulin morning dose 50 units NPH, 15 units regular,
evening dose 15 units NPH, 6 units regular.
2.  Lipitor.
3.  Nexium.
4.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Zoloft.
6.  Albuterol prn.
7.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Zetia 10 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative for alcohol, drugs and very
distant, 20 years, tobacco use.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denied any fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, chest pain, jaw pain, arm pain or
diaphoresis.  The patient did endorse that she had had
longstanding bilateral lower extremity edema and that she had
to sleep on three pillows at night in order to breath
comfortably.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient
was afebrile, 98.3, blood pressure 108/60, pulse 78,
breathing 18 times per minute, 98% on 2 liters of nasal
cannula.  In general, she was an obese white female,
uncomfortable in bed, alert and oriented times three but in
no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination, moist mucous membranes, pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light and anicteric.  Neck examination:
Obese, no jugulovenous distension was visualized.  Lungs:
Even, unlabored breathing, clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac examination:  Very distant, S1 and S2, no murmurs,
rubs or gallops noted.  Abdominal examination:  Obese, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity
examination, 1 to 2+ pitting edema in the bilateral lower
extremities.  Positive venostatic changes.  Extremities were
warm, dry and well perfused.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data on admission
revealed white count 9.8, hematocrit 37.2, platelets 343.
Chem-7 sodium 137, potassium 5.0, chloride 101, bicarbonate
26, BUN 29, creatinine 1.2, glucose 282.  PT 14.4, PTT 67.6,
INR 1.4.  Urinalysis was performed which showed 21 to 50
white blood cells, few bacteria, 1000 glucose.  Creatinine
kinase 217, CKMB 10, MVI 4.6, troponin 0.33.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service with the attending being Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2031**].  The patient
underwent the cardiac catheterization on [**2188-1-14**].
The results of the catheterization are as follows:
1.  Severe vessel coronary artery disease.
2.  Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3.  Dominant right coronary artery had diffuse 80 to 90%
stenosis with an 80% posterior descending artery lesion.  The
LMDA had a 70 to 80% disease of the distal portion of the
vessel.  The left circumflex had a diffuse 80% disease with
minimal disease in the obtuse medial branches.  Resting
hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left-sided pressures
of 38 mm of mercury.  The left ventriculography was deferred
during this examination.

The left ventricular systolic function was determined to be
approximately 55%.  Following the cardiac catheterization the
admitting team asked for Cardiothoracic Surgery consult, for
possible coronary artery bypass grafting.

Following the cardiac catheterization the patient was
admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit due to the fact that she
had an intra-arterial balloon pump inserted during the
catheterization.  Inside the unit the patient was maintained
on Lasix, Nitroglycerin drip, Lipitor, heparin drip.  The
patient was placed on Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for treatment
of the suspected urinary tract infection.

On [**2188-1-15**], the patient underwent a coronary artery
bypass grafting times four.  She had her left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal, saphenous vein graft to diagonal,
saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.  The
cross-clamp time was 94 minutes.  The coronary bypass time
was 160 minutes.  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] and
assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8420**].  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and there were no complications during the
surgery.  Following the procedure the patient was transferred
to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on Milrinone and
Neo-Synephrine drips.  The patient was atrially paced at 90
beats/minute.

On postoperative day #1 the patient was maintained intubated.
She continues to be sedated with Propofol.  The patient was
also in insulin, Neo-Synephrine and Milrinone drips.  The
patient was continued to be atrially paced at 90 with good
blood pressure and cardiac index.  The Milrinone was slowly
weaned as well as the Neo-Synephrine.  They were unable to
wean her off the vent secondary to low carbon dioxide
titrated with increased FIO2 being required.

On postoperative day #2, the patient remained sedated with a
slow wean due to the fluid overload.  The patient responded
to voice when the Propofol had weaned down.  The Propofol was
eventually completely weaned off by the early morning.  The
patient remained on the Neo-Synephrine drip for second day
blood pressure within acceptable limits.  FIO2 was titrated
down to 50% at this time.  The IABP was turned off and
removed on this day.  By postoperative day #3 the patient
only remained on the Milrinone, Neo-Synephrine and insulin
drip.  Her FIO2 was down to 40% and the patient was
spontaneously breathing above the ventilation rate.  From the
cardiac standpoint the Neo-Synephrine continued to be weaned
down.  Her cardiac index remained approximately 2.0.  The
patient did receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a
low hematocrit at that time.

On postoperative day #4, the patient remained atrially paced
at 90 with rare ectopy.  The patient was extubated early this
morning which was complicated by approximately one hour of
apnea.  The patient had difficulty, was unable to cough and
was unable to adequate clear her secretions.
Cardiovascularly, the patient's Milrinone was weaned
completely off with her cardiac index at 3.0.  Her Swan was
removed and the port was capped.  The Neo-Synephrine was
additionally weaned to off.  The patient had been out of bed
to chair several times during the day and was able to
tolerate that without any difficulty.  The patient was seen
by physical therapy for an evaluation and it was determined
at this time that the patient would most likely be needing to
go to an Acute Rehabilitation Facility following her
discharge from the hospital.

On postoperative day #5, the patient was transferred out of
the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit down to the surgical floor.
The patient continued to be paced at 90 with an underlying
rhythm of 80s and sinus rhythm with occasional premature
atrial contractions.  The patient's systolic blood pressure
while paced remained greater than 100 but would dip down into
the mid 80s when she was not paced.  The patient was able to
produce an adequate cough and clear her lungs producing a
thick white sputum.  The patient continued to use Albuterol
inhalers and was able to maintain her oxygen saturations at
greater than 95% on 2 liters of nasal cannula.  The patient
was abl
