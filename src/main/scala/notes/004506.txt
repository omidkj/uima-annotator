Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath w/ Resp. failure and PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2200-6-3**] Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 4 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to
OM, SVG to Diag, SVG to PDA)
[**2200-6-1**] Cardiac Catherization

History of Present Illness:
63M with hx of CAD (no stents), PVD, DM, HTN who presents with
resp failure and PEA arrest. Per pt's wife, he complained of
acute onset of shortness of breath at home. He did not complain
of any chest pain or palpitations. She gave him inhalers which
did not help him and so she called EMS. When EMS arrived, pt
became unresponsive and pulseless. On rhythm strip, he was in
PEA. He was intubated in the field and his pulse returned. Pt
was initially taken to [**Hospital6 3105**] where he was
noted to have 1mm ST depressions in II, III and aVF and 2mm ST
depressions in V4-V6. He was given lopressor, lasix and started
on nitro and heparin drips. He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ER. He was taken initially to the CCU and then to the cath lab
where he was found to have 3-vessel disease.

Past Medical History:
Coronary Artery Disease, Respiratory failure and PEA arrest
(prior to admission), Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus,
Hypercholesterolemia, Stroke [**2-22**] yrs ago, Peripheral Vascular
Disease, Psoriasis, s/p Left CEA

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use but pt smoked 1ppd x 50 years, quit in [**2199**] after stroke.
There is history of heavy alcohol abuse, quit 20 years ago.

Family History:
Pt has strong family history of CAD. He has 16 brothers and
sister, all of whom have CAD and DM. His mother died suddenly of
heart attack while dancing at age of 59. Two of his brothers
died in their early 60s of heart disease.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2200-6-9**] 8:28 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
HISTORY: 63-year-old man status post CABG.

COMPARISON: [**2200-6-7**].

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
are stable status post median sternotomy and CABG. Pulmonary
vasculature is unremarkable. Bilateral mid and lower lung linear
atelectasis is unchanged. The small left pleural effusion is
stable. No right effusion is identified. Osseous and soft tissue
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the chest with linear
atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2200-6-8**] 3:55 PM

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

Reason: PAIN AND SWELLING

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man with possilble DVT
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o DVT
INDICATION: Possible DVT.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler images of the common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed
bilaterally. Normal compressibility, augmentation, flow,
waveforms are demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is
identified. Approximately 2.5 x 1.1 cm superficial hypoechoic
collection in the left calf traverses the entire length of the
inner calf and likely represents a postsurgical hematoma.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of DVT.
2. Left calf hematoma.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
