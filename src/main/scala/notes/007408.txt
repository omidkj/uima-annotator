History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male s/p porcine AVR [**2130**], known
coronary artery disease s/p right coronary bare metal stent in
[**2143-11-30**], and history of pulmonary embolus(on coumadin) who
presents with persistent and worsening symptoms of shortness of
breath/angina over the past month. He notes increasing frequency
and longer durations of his anginal episodes. When exerting
himself, he has substernal chest pain radiating to his right
arm. He also has been feeling lousy for the past month. He notes
dry cough, hoarseness, chills, and myalgias. He notes rigors
with Tmax 99 at home. He has been having upper abdominal pain.
He saw his cardiologist where he had blood cultures and
troponins were drawn. He was found to have a positive troponins
and blood cultures were positive for staphylococcus. Given the
above findings, he was sent to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and treatment. In the ED, initial vitals were 98.4
121/69 55 18 100% on RA. Patient given 1 dose of vancomycin and
tylenol for fever. He was rigoring when the ED resident saw him.
He was chest pain free prior to transfer.

Imaging:
[**2144-3-6**] TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present which
appears to be well-seated with normal leaflet motion. The
leaflets are thickened. There is a large vegetation on the
anterior aspect of the aortic valve bioprosthesis, measuring up
to 1.2 x 2.0 cm. The vegetation appears highly mobile and
prolapses into the LVOT during diastole. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Large, mobile
bioprosthetic aortic valve vegetation. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
[**2144-3-6**] CT Torso: No sequela of septic emboli noted.  Slight
interval enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes. Prostamegaly.
Vasculopathy.
.
[**2144-3-10**] Carotid doppler: Right ICA 40-59% stenosis. Left ICA
40-59% stenosis. There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
There is antegrade left vertebral artery flow.
[**2144-3-13**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-CPB: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45 %). There is hypokinesis of the basal and mid
inferolateral segments. There is akinesis of the basal inferior
wall segment. A bioprosthetic aortic valve is present. The
prosthetic aortic valve leaflets are thickened. There is a
moderate-sized, mobile vegetation on the aortic valve which
appears to prolapse into the LVOT in diastole. Mild (1+)
eccentric aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened and appears somewhat tethered.
Moderate (2+) central mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-CPB: There is a bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic
position. The valve is well-seated with normal leaflet mobility.
There is a small paravalvular leak seen the area between what
would have been the left and non-coronary cusps. This leak
persisted after protamine administration. The LV systolic
function similar to preop, estimated EF is 45%. There is no
evidence of aortic dissection.

[**2144-3-17**] Discharge Chest x-ray:
Moderate postoperative cardiac enlargement persists. Sternotomy
wires in unchanged position. The previously existing blunting of
the lateral pleural sinuses has regressed and is almost
eliminated on the right side. The left lateral pleural sinus
demonstrates some residual pleural density extending into the
posterior pleural sinus. No new parenchymal pulmonary
abnormalities are identified. Comparison also shows that there
is some moderate degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes
posterior segments  remaining but again no new acute infiltrates
are seen. No pneumothorax is identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted under cardiology with subacute
endocarditis and worsening angina. He ruled out for myocardial
infarction and remained pain free on medical therapy. TEE was
notable for a large mobile vegetation on his bovine aortic
valve.  He had one positive blood culture growing staph capitis
from an outside lab and two blood cultures here growing gram
negative rods, making propionibacterium the likely culprit.
There were no signs of septic emboli, perivalvular abscess, or
heart failure. ID was consulted and he was placed on Vancomycin
initially with coverage broadened to include Gentamicin,
Rifampin, and Ciprofloxacin.
