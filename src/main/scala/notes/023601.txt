Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Malaise, SOB; fever, chills and rigors after using portho-cath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left portho-cath removal on [**2160-7-11**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 53-year-old man with Crohn's Disease, s/p total
proctocolectomy with ileostomy, c/b short gut syndrome, on
chronic TPN, with multiple recurrent line infections with MSSA,
CoNS, and GNRs, septic pulmonary emboli and bronchiectasis, who
is admitted with shortness of breath and rigors. The pt first
started feeling ill approx 2 weeks PTA with non-specific
complaints, and then developed night sweats and a non-productive
cough. He called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**], who arranged for a Chest CT, which
showed multiple new lower lobe cavitating nodules concerning for
multiple septic emboli. Peripheral blood cultures were
reportedly negative at the time. He was to come in for repeat
blood cultures and cultures off his line, but over the last 2
days developed worsening symptoms of dyspnea on exertion,
right-sided chest pain, and rigors on the night PTA. He called
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] about these new symptoms, and was advised to come in
to the ED for concern of a recurrent line infection and septic
pulmonary emboli.

Blood cutlure ER: S aureus ([**11-28**] in the ER)
Blood cutlures: Negative 5 (plus one fungal)

Catheter tip culture: no growth

Beta-D-glucan 412

Cryptococcus negative
Histoplasma pending
Blastomycosis pending

CXR:
There is a central line with the tip at the cavoatrial junction.
There is
some added density in the right costophrenic angle, this is new
since the
prior examination and may represent a focus of consolidation.
Followup chest
radiograph is advised to clearance. Left lung is clear. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.

Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-8-30**],
the findings are similar. If clinically suggested, the absence
of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude
endocarditis.

CT scan:
1. Multiple new lower lobe, subpleural predominant poorly
defined nodules, a
few of which demonstrate cavitation. Considering history of
previous septic
emboli, recurrent septic emboli are a likely possibility.
Differential
diagnosis includes granulomatous infections (fungal and
mycobacterial),
vasculitis, and, less likely, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia
(rarely
cavitary).

2. Splenomegaly with marked increase in size of spleen since
recent study,
incompletely evaluated due to incomplete imaging.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient came to the [**Hospital1 1388**] ER for fever, chills, SOB after
using his left portho-cath for his TPN. In the ED: VS were Temp
97.9 F, HR 77, BP 89/56, R 18, O2-sat 99% RA. He was given 3L NS
and Blood Cx were drawn. His BP responded to SBP 100. He
received Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin, and then spiked a
temperature to 101.3F with rigors, for which he received Tylenol
with good response. Given the pulmonary symptoms and recent
Chest CT scan, he also received Levofloxacin. UA was negative.
He was admitted to the ICU for further care.

In the MICU Mr. [**Known lastname **] had blood cultures done (which were
negative) and was started on Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone (Day 1
[**2160-7-10**]). Patient kept spiking fevers up to 102 F. Patient
had a repeat CXR that showed an infiltrate in the L lower lobe.
Patient received 3 L of NS to increase his SBP >90. THen
paitent's BP was stable for the next ~24 horus. Patient had a
TTE that ruled out endocarditis and was transfered to the
medical floor on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2. SInce patient requiring 6-week course
of antibiotics it was decided not to pursue TEE, since it would
not change management.

On arrival to the floor patient spiked a Temp of 102. He was
given standing tylenol and IV fluids. Cultures were tried from
the portho-cath, but was no longer working. Cultures were taken
from the peripheral blood (negative) and fungal studies were
