lower lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. DKA:  Patient with history of Type 1 Insulin Dependant
Diabetes since age 5. Had not seen a doctor in years. Obtaining
insulin in [**Country 6607**] and self dosing based on "how he felt"  On
Admission, initial BS was 310, and he was started on an insulin
drip in the ED.  FS were monitored q1h and pH and lytes were
checked q4h.  He was maintained on an insulin drip until his AG
closed and transitioned to SQ insulin. [**Last Name (un) **] consulted and
aided in insulin regimen with higher dose of evening Lantus and
an aggressive sliding scale; they will follow-up with patient
within one week of discharge.

2. Community acquired multifocal pneumonia: Patient with
reported 10 days of URI symptoms. CXR on admission consistent
with multifocal pneumonia. There was some suspicion that this
was a post-influenza bacterial pneumonia, with sputum Gram stain
showing 3+ GPC in clusters, consistent with his MSSA bacteremia.
Patient started on ceftiaxone/azithromycin on [**2-22**], which was
later transitioned to Levofloxacin for a 5-day course.  With
continued fevers on this regimen, further cultures and imaging
(CT chest) were obtained that showed know multifocal pneumonia
with very small pleural effusions, and no evidence of
abscess/loculation.  On CXR upon transfer, there is a
radiolucency that may be indicative of cavitation, which will
need follow-up imaging.

3. MSSA bacteremia: Pulmonary source, with 3+ GPCs in clusters
on gram stain. Gram positive cocci in clusters grew from
cultures on [**2-22**], with surveillance cultures negative to date.
Patient started on vancomycin on [**2-23**] which was transitioned to
Nafcillin on [**2-24**] after grew out to be MSSA. Given the risk of
endocarditis with Staph aureus, TTE was done and did not show
any vegetations.  A PICC line was placed once he was afebrile
and culture-negative for >48 hours and he will be continued on
Nafcillin for a 21-day course.

4. Tachycardia: Patient profoundly tachycardic on admission with
heart rates in 170s. EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia. Patient
was aggressively hydrated, but the tachycardia persisted.
Etiology deemed secondary to infection, pleuritic chest pain
secondary to pneumonia, also possible withdrawal given negative
serum EtOH or nicotine withdrawal. TSH was within normal limits.
He required IVF boluses to manage his tachycardia on exertion
that persisted despite being afebrile and improving clinically.


5. Alcohol abuse: Per report patient drinks [**5-1**] vodka
drinks/day. Written for CIWA scale on night of admission.
Received 5mg IV valium on night of admission due to persistent
tachycardia into 170s and hypertension with SBP~150s. Heart and
blood pressure improved.  Since he did not score the CIWA scale,
there was no need for further valium in house. Social work
consulted to address alcohol use especially in setting of
diabetes.
