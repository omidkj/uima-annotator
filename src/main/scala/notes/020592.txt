Admission Date:  [**2171-6-3**]       Discharge Date: [**2171-8-23**]

Service:  MEDICINE

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiac:  The patient had three issues
during his hospital course.  Ischemia, his non ST elevation
myocardial infarction on [**8-5**] was treated with Lovenox for
72 hours 120 mg b.i.d. and he was also continued on a daily
adult size aspirin and a beta blocker.  He had no more
episodes of chest pain during the remainder of his hospital
course and in terms of his ischemic heart disease was deemed
to be stable.  Sinus tachycardia, his rate was controlled
with Lopressor, which was titrated up to 150 mg b.i.d.  It
was a sinus tach secondary to a hypovolemia after his last
skin graft at the end of [**Month (only) 205**], which is believed to have
caused his non ST elevation myocardial infarction, so his
rate was maintained with the Lopressor at a baseline in the
90s to low 100s with a baseline blood pressure of 80 to
90s/50s to 60s.  In addition in order to control the sinus
tachycardia, the patient's pain and anxiety were controlled.
The third cardiac issue is a past medical history significant
for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  The patient was treated
for 72 hours for his non ST elevation myocardial infarction
with Lovenox and he was started on Coumadin.  Lovenox and
Coumadin were overlapped until they became therapeutic on his
Coumadin and INR between 2 and 3 at which point the Lovenox
was discontinued.

2.  Infectious disease:  In terms of the patient's
necrotizing fasciitis as mentioned in the previous portion of
this discharge summary the patient was treated with multiple
skin debridement and a long course of antibiotics and a skin
graft a donor site from his back to his right thigh.  The
antibiotics were discontinued on [**8-8**].  Infectious
disease had signed off saying that he had no further evidence
of infection and during his hospital stay at the Medicine
Service his skin graft was followed by the Trauma Surgery
Service and was deemed to be steadily improving.  On [**2171-8-17**] the patient had a PICC line in the right antecubital
area, which was pulled, because the area of insertion was
erythematous and slightly indurated.  At that time the
patient did not have an elevated white blood cell count and
was not afebrile.  A culture from the PICC line tip was sent,
which on [**2171-8-19**] revealed an MRSA culture greater
then 15 colonies.  At this point the patient still had no
evaluated white count and his highest temperature was 100.4.
Infectious disease was reconsulted and the patient was begun
on a course of intravenous Vancomycin 1 gram q 12 hours.  On
[**8-20**] the patient had a PICC line placed in the left arm
by interventional radiology for the administration of the
intravenous Vancomycin.  The patient's white count had still
be stable and not elevated.  On [**8-21**] it is 6.2 and his
temperature today is 99.3.

3.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  During his hospital
course when admitted to the Medical Service on a intravenous
fluids of normal saline with 40 milliequivalents of potassium
chloride and was on Boost for breakfast, lunch and dinner and
house diet.  Eventually the intravenous fluids were
discontinued and the patient's electrolytes were followed
closely.  They were repleted as necessary.  The patient over
the course of his hospital stay gradually started taking
better po, drinking his Boost and eating his meals and his
urine output was adequate and he did have adequate bowel
movements.

4.  Hematology:  The patient had a stable hematocrit in the
low 30s.  On [**2171-8-13**] the patient was transfused one
unit of red blood cells, because of concern that his sinus
tachycardiac might be due to his decreased oxygen delivery
with his substantial wound healing.  His hematocrit increased
the next day to 32.7.  The patient was administered 325 mg of
iron three times a day.  His anemia is likely an anemia of
chronic disease as iron studies were drawn and laboratories
were consistent with this picture.

5.  Pain:  The patient was admitted on a Fentanyl PCA with
Oxycodone in addition 30 mg every eight hours.  This was
discontinued and the patient was placed on oral morphine 60
mg every eight hours with instant relief for breakthrough
pain.  On [**2171-8-20**] this was deemed to be inadequate
for the patient's pain coverage and he was placed on a
morphine PCA.  The plan is pain wise is to monitor how much
morphine he is using and then switch him back to the
analgesic equivalent dose of oral morphine so that we can
transition him to a po medication rather then a PCA.

6.  Psychiatric:  The patient had a psychiatry consult while
in the hospital and they recommended Remeron 30 mg every
evening for depression and Zyprexa 2.5 mg as needed for
anxiety.

7.  Physical therapy:  They have been following him and
seeing him approximately three times a week.  They have been
taking him to the chair and they feel that he is improving.

The condition of the patient at this time is stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Necrotizing fascitis.

He is to follow up at his rehabilitation hospital.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 150 mg b.i.d., aspirin 325
mg q.d., Coumadin 2.5 mg q.h.s., Vancomycin 1 gram q 12 hours
delivered by intravenous today is day two of what should be a
seven day course.  He is on a morphine sulfate PCA without a
basal rate, a 1.5 mg injection every time he presses the
button with a six minute lock out.  He is on a fluocinolone
ointment and _________ ointment, sublingual nitro prn for
chest pain, Benadryl prn for urticaria, Hydroxizine 25 mg
b.i.d., _______________ 30 mg q.h.s., iron sulfate 325 mg
t.i.d., magnesium oxide 800 mg t.i.d., calcium carbonate 500
mg t.i.d. as needed and sucralfate 1 gram q.i.d.

The plan is for Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is to follow up at his
rehabilitation hospital to eventually wean him off of his PCA
and to discontinue the intravenous Vancomycin once his blood
cultures come back from [**8-19**] and he is to see the
attending surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks for follow up
to discuss the next skin graft, which should be in a few
months.
