Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6378**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, Renal Failure, Low Hematocrit

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central Line Placement
Arterial Line Placement
Blood Transfusions (6 units)

History of Present Illness:
63yof w h/o severe diastolic CHF, pulmonary HTN, afib, possible
ulcerative colitis, recent LGIB, prior h/o bleeding duodenal
ulcers presented 3 days ago from an outpatient renal appointment
with a HCT of 17 and a creatinine of 3.  She has a history of
chronic anemia likely [**1-22**] CKD and chronic inflammation, with
baseline HCT of 22-25.  She previously had a baseline creatinine
of ~1.5 but bumped up to a new baseline of ~2-2.5 since having
acute decompensated diastolic heart failure 3 months ago.  She
was previously admitted last month for hematochezia with a
HCT=19, and was found to have bleeding colonic angioectasias
that were cauterized on colonoscopy.  She also has a history of
recurrent UGIB from duodenal ulcers, though her most recent EGD
during the last admission was normal.  Per pt, she had been
having diarrhea for ~2 wks before admission (2 loose BMs/day),
with some red blood in the stool (denies melena).  She also had
some nausea and vomiting 1-2 days prior to admission, with small
blood in her very last episode of emesis.  She had also fallen 2
days prior to admission due to tripping on her nightgown as she
was getting undressed, with resulting bruises and bilateral leg
pain that she self-treated with oxycodone.
.
In ED, initial VS= 97.8 60 109/52 16 96%/RA.  On exam she was
clinically fluid overloaded and guiac+ with melenic stool.  NG
lavage was negative.  Coags were normal.  +Eos in her urine.
She was made NPO, given Protonix 40 mg IV x1, transfused 2U
pRBCs, and admitted to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, she was lethargic and complained of leg, low back,
and arm pain.  She was hypotensive with SBP in the 80s and was
started on pressors.  HCT initially did not bump with
transfusion, so CT of torso and lower extremities was obtained,
showing no retroperitoneal bleed or significant hematoma.  Pt
received an additional 4U pRBCs, with HCT stabilizing at ~23.
Her BP improved but dropped back to the 80s with morphine 0.5 mg
for pain, requiring her to transiently be back on pressors.  She
had one BM yesterday that she did not look at.  She did not have
vomiting.  She was not scoped in the MICU as apparently she
needs to be intubated for this (unclear why).
NG lavage today revealed no blood, and pt was started on a clear
diet and transferred to the floor.
.
Currently, pt complains of leg, low back, and arm pain.  She
denies nausea or abdominal pain.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Spontaneous nosebleeds x past 2 weeks, up to several per
day.  DOE (including walking on level ground).  Gained ~50 lbs
over past 2 yrs (was 135 lbs previously).  Has palpitations
likely from afib.  Has intermitent dry cough.  Has wheezing/SOB
that she attributes to heart failure, but for some reason she
takes albuterol for this.  Thinks her skin has been getting
diffusely darker recently.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent URI symptoms,
chest pain, dysuria, rash.

ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. A septal occluder device is seen across the interatrial
septum. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] There is a very small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricular with mild global
hypokinesis. Mildly depressed left ventricular function. Severe
triscuspid regurgitation. At least mild pulmonary hypertension
(likely UNDERestimated). Very small pericardial effusion around
the atria.
.
CT left lower extremity: 6.6 x 2.7 x 12.0 cm subcutaneous
hematoma in the lateral proximal thigh.
.
CT right lower extremity:
1. Soft tissue edema.
2. No large hematoma.
3. No acute fracture.
4. Small [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst.
.
CT torso:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal or other hematoma.
2. Extensive subcutaneous edema and bilateral pleural effusions
as well as
trace ascites.
3. Atherosclerotic disease.
4. Degenerative changes of the spine including compression
deformities, one
of which appears slightly progressed from the chest CT done in
[**2107**].
5. Biliary sludge
.
Tib/fib films: No fracture
.
Renal ultrasound:  The right kidney measures 8.5 cm in length.
The left kidney measures 9.3 cm in length. Each kidney appears
normal without stones, masses, or hydronephrosis. The partly
full pre-void bladder is unremarkable. The postvoid residual is
negligible, measuring about 10 mL.

IMPRESSION: Unremarkable study.
.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation, mean ventricular rate 63. Low ARS
voltage diffusely. Right ventricular conduction delay. Prolonged
QTc interval. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2109-1-24**]
multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist without major
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) Acute on chronic anemia--Hematocrit was 17 on admission, from
baseline of 25. As
