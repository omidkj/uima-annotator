History of Present Illness:
This 82-year-old lady with severe peripheral
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease and end-stage kidney disease (on
hemodialysis) has rest pain of her left foot with a small
ulceration.  She has previously undergone a left external
iliac artery angioplasty and stent via a percutaneous
approach.  Recent CT angiography showed the stent to be
occluded with complete thrombosis of her common femoral
artery.  Her superficial femoral artery is chronically
occluded, and the profunda femoris artery is patent.  We are
attempting to reopen the previously placed covered stent
graft in the iliac and then revise the problem.


Past Medical History:
-ESRD on HD, had renal artery stenosis, s/p stent
-Afib
-Controversial dx of SCLCA
-Hypothyroid
-Hx GI bleed in the past
-Hx old foot drop (presumed left based on exam)

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 27974**],[**Known firstname 27975**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27976**] admitted on [**5-11**] with Ischemic
ulcer and rest pain of theleft foot.

She agreed to have an elective surgery. Pre-operatively, she was
consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were
obtained,  all other preperations were made.

It was decided that she would undergo a:

Left external iliac thrombectomy with common and deep femoral
artery endarterectomy and patch angioplasty using
endarterectomized superficial femoral artery and
saphenous vein with selective left iliac angiography, stenting
of proximal common/external iliac and distal external
iliac/common femoral arteries, and completion arteriography.

She was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well
without any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, she was extubated and transferred to the [**Month/Year (2) 13042**]
for further stabilization and monitoring. While in the [**Name (NI) 13042**] pt
went into Atrial fibrillation. A cardiology consult was
obtained. They recommended to hold amiodaron, Give IV lopressor
and fluid resusitation. To note pt did have history of
tachybrady syndrome and has a PPM in place.

A renal consult was alos obtained. for HD. She did recieve HD on
her scheduled days while here.

Pt was also noted to have a HCT of 19. She did recieve blood
products. A stat cat scan was obtained. She did not have a
retroperitoneal bleed. Her HCT was stable post operative period.


She was admitted to the CVICU for further care. A EP consult was
also obtained. They agreed with cardiology plans. They also
recommended to hold amiodarone and to titrated BB as needed.

She was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While
in the VICU she recieved monitered care. When stable she was
delined including her aline. Her diet was advanced. A PT consult
was obtained.

To note her troponins were followed, she plateued. EP and
cardiology signed off. They recommended no amiodarone and to
titrate the BB as necessary.

When she was stabalized from the acute setting of post operative
care, she was transfered to floor status

On the floor, she remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. She progressed with physical therapy to improve her
strength and mobility.

Also on the floor her abdomen became distended. KUB demonstarted
an ileus. Her pain meds were held. Made NPO. Reglan and
erthromycin were started.

She also had a coughing episode where the expectorant was
purulent. This was sent for gram stain. Antibiotics were then
started. CXR revealed atelectasis vs PNA.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2123-5-14**]):

[**12-6**] PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI. IN PAIRS AND
CLUSTERS.
1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2123-5-16**]):
SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.

Pt afebrile, no WBC. After sputum cx showed Commensal
Respiratory Flora, her antibiotics where then stopped.

Her ileus resolved with conservative treatment. She is taking PO
without difficulty.

She continues to make steady progress without any incidents. She
was discharged to a rehabilitation facility in stable condition.
