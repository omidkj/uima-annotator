Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, cough, LE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart catheterization
arterial line placement
central line placement


History of Present Illness:
39 yo F w a pmh of depression, seasonal allergies, presents with
new cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15%. Over the past 3 months she
has had progressive DOE. She noted that her excercise tolerance
has steadily diminished over this time, she was initially able
to run on the treadmill for 4 mi 3-4x/week, now she cannot do
[**1-26**] mi without SOB. Approximately 3 weeks ago she began to
develop a cough and some wheezing, which she attributed to
seasonal allergies, claritin provided some relief. She traveled
to [**State 108**] were her cough worsened, she developed fevers to 102
and nausea/vomiting. She also noted trace LE edema. She
presented to her PCP who treated her for bronchitis with
azithromycin. This did not relieve her symptoms, her cough
worsened, she developed severe LE edema (3+). At her
cardiologist's office an echo revealed an EF of 30%. She was
started on Lasix 40 PO and Coreg 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **]. Her edema improved
markedly. A few days prior to admission the pt. presented to an
OSH with weakness, dizziness, diaphoresis. She was noted to be
hypotensive (86/72) and received fluid resuscutation. Per OSH
records she had a 8 and 10 beat run of VT. Her cardiac enzymes
were negative. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
+ orthopnea, + h/o SOB, +LE edema, poor appetite, denies weight
loss, chest pain, abdominal pain, changes in Bowel/bladder fxn,
rashes, joint pains.  Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
positive for dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, negative for palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated: (not official read) sinus tach, left and right
atrial enlargment, TWI in v5, v6, TW flattening in v4, freq.
PVCs, low voltage in limb leads. with no significant change
compared with prior dated [**2162-6-12**]
TELEMETRY demonstrated:tachycardia, NSR, freq. PVCs
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**6-13**] demonstrated: prelim read:
mild MR, TR. hypokinetic LV and RV, LA and RA enlargement. Small
pericardial effusion.

CXR: Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Pulmonary vascularity is
within normal limits. Basilar atelectasis is present bilaterally
and there are questionable small pleural effusions. Followup
radiographs with improved inspiratory level may be helpful for
more complete assessment of the bases when the patient's
condition permits.

TTE: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated.
Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (EF 10%).
The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated, with moderate global
right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot
be determined. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction.
Moderate right ventricular systolic dysfunction.

CATH: PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right internal jugular vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge
pressure
catheter, advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French
introducing
sheath.  Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.

Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
1.  Resting hemodynamic monitoring demonstrates mildly elevated
biventricular filling pressure, moderate pulmonary hypertension,
and low
cardiac output.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe ventricular dysfunction.

ABD ULTRASOUND: FINDINGS: The liver is mildly increased in size,
with normal echotexture without evidence of focal lesion. The
gallbladder is normal. There is no evidence of intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common duct
measures 6 mm. The pancreas is not well visualized. The aorta is
normal in caliber throughout. The right kidney measures 10.5 cm
and the left 10.4 cm. The renal parenchymal echogenicity and
thickness are normal without evidence of calculi or
hydronephrosis. The spleen is normal in size and echogenicity.
The portal vein is patent with antegrade flow.

IMPRESSION:
Mild hepatomegaly; otherwise, unremarkable abdominal ultrasound.

CAROTID U/S: FINDINGS: The bilateral common carotid artery,
internal carotid artery and external carotid artery are widely
patent and demonstrate normal arterial waveforms. The bilateral
vertebral arteries are antegrade in direction.

Peak systolic velocities of the right internal carotid artery is
78 cm/sec with a right ICA/CCA ratio of 0.78. No evidence of
intraluminal plaque.

Peak systolic velocity of the left internal carotid artery is
109 cm/sec, corresponding to a left ICA/CCA ratio of 1.4. No
evidence of intraluminal plaque.

IMPRESSION: Normal carotid ultrasound. No evidence of
hemodynamically significant stenosis.

ECHO ([**2162-6-15**]--2 DAYS LATER THAN PREVIOUS):
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis.
Apical contraction is relative[**Name (NI) 72784**] preserved. No intraventricular
thrombus is
seen, but apical views are suboptimal. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
There is a small circumferential pericard
