History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1182**] is a 59 year-old woman with a history of pulmonary
fibrosis (thought secondary to radiation therapy), asthma,
achalasia, and chronic low back pain who is admitted to the MICU
today after being found unresponsive at [**Hospital **] Rehab this
morning. By report, Ms. [**Known lastname 1182**] was noted by staff to be
unresponsive to sternal rub around 8:45 am. Her BP was 86/54, HR
87, and she was noted to have pulmonary wheezes and pinpoint
pupils on exam (her fentanyl patch dose had been increased
yesterday). An ABG while on supplemental oxygen was 7.14/88/406.
By report, she was given IV naloxone 0.8 mg IV x2, then 0.4 mg
IV x1 (2mg total) and a dose of SC epinephrine and slowly
started to wake up. Her fingerstick was 247. As she awoke, she
began complaining of severe respiratory distress. She was also
noted by rehab staff to vomit 100cc of dark liquid. EMS was
called and put her on BiPAP.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was noted to be crying out and
complaining of respiratory distress. She had a T 100.3, HR 140,
BP 143/102, RR 42, O2Sat 88% on BiPAP; an ABG was 7.21/84/57.
She was emergently intubated and a right femoral triple lumen
central line was placed for emergent access. A CXR showed a
dense RLL infiltrate. Post-intubation, she was noted to have low
O2Sats down to the high 70s/low 80s on an FiO2 of 1.0 with peak
airway pressures >60. She was given a bolus of vecuronium
without noticeable improvement in her respiratory function. Her
systolic blood pressure dropped into the 80s, and she was taken
off of her propofol and started on norepinephrine. She was noted
to have slightly improved O2Sats when she was placed with her
left side down. She received methylprenisolone 125mg IV,
ceftazidime 1000mg IV, metronidazole 500mg IV, and azithromycin
500mg IV. She was deemed too unstable to go for a CT angiogram.

.
Also of note, she was noted to have Guaiac positive brown stool
in the ED.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2115-1-2**]):
Single bedside AP examination labeled "supine at 11:30 hours"
compared with most recent study dated [**12-11**], as well as previous
study, dated [**2114-10-4**]. The ET tube tip is not well seen, but
appears to lie some 2.7 cm proximal to the carina, and the
distal portion of the endogastric tube reaches the gastric body,
with sidehole projected over the fundus. There is a diffuse,
patchy and confluent airspace process involving the right mid
lung and base, new. There is also patchy retrocardiac opacity,
which has become more confluent over the interval. The heart
size is not much changed, with no further vascular
redistribution (allowing for this positioning). Again
demonstrated are numerous surgical clips in the mediastinum when
projected over the esophageal hiatus, and in the upper abdominal
midline, as well as surgical chain suture following the contour
of the lateral left hemidiaphragm.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 59 year old woman with hypoxemic respiratory failure
likely due to severe aspiration pneumonitis (on top of baseline
radiation pneumonitis) in the setting of altered mental status,
likely from iatrogenic narcotic overdose.

1) Respiratory Failure
In regards to her respiratory failure, this is most likely
secondary to severe chemical pneumonitis due to aspiration on
top of her background pulmonary fibrosis and asthma. In
addition, she has evidence of ARDS given her PaO2/FiO2 ratio and
bilateral infiltrates. She has been vented on the ARDSnet
protocol with low tidal volumes. She was treated empirically
with Vancomycin and ceftazidime for 10-day course, although
cultures (sputum and BAL) have not grown to date. Bronchoscopy
demonstrated frothy, clear secretions. Her MDI's have also been
continued around the clock. Due to her poor oxygenation at
admission, she had a TTE on admission with a bubble study, which
was positive, indicative of an intracardiac shunt.  She was
initially on CTX and vanc -> the CTX was changed to Ceftazidime
on [**1-5**] for broader coverage.  She finished a 10 day course of
vanco/ceftaz for ARDS/PNA on [**2115-1-13**].  She was extubated
successfully on that day.  She continues to do well on minimal
oxygen supplementation.  She was transferred to the general
medical floor and did well.
.
2) Hypotension
She was initially hypotensive on admission, likely exacerbated
by her high PEEP at 18-20 on admission, requiring levophed. This
has since been weaned off and her BP's have been stable. Her
anti-hypertensives have been held. She has been started on lasix
for diuresis for goal CVP 3-4 given her concurrent ARDS as her
BP has been allowing for goal negative 1-2 L/day.
.
3) Guiaic positive stool
On admission, she also had guiac positive stool and ?coffee
ground emesis. No further occurences, but she did receive 2 U
PRBCs since admission for decreased Hct. She is on a PPI [**Hospital1 **].
.
4)  Chronic Back Pain
Her major active issue on the medical floor remained her chronic
lower back pain and finding a regimen that will achieve adequate
pain control without causing excessive sedation.  She was
continued on her fentanyl patch at 100mcg q72hrs, topical
lidoderm patch, tylenol RTC, ultram q6, and oxycodone prn.
Her Neurontin was held since admission due to concern re:
sedation.  This may be re-introduced at a low dose and titrated
upward slowly if this is thought
