Admission Date:  [**2104-11-19**]       Discharge Date:


Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dehydration, nausea, vomiting and increased
ostomy output.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
female with history of ulcerative colitis status post
ileostomy in [**2087**] with severe COPD and a past admission for
severe diarrhea which led to acute renal failure, who was in
her usual state of health until 4-5 days prior to admission
when a VNA nurse noted increased output from her ostomy.  She
also was complaining of decreased po intake and post tussive
vomiting at that time.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] went to the patient's
house on the day of admission and felt she should come to the
Emergency Room for evaluation.  She was also stating that she
had a slight increase in shortness of breath above baseline.
In the Emergency Room she was orthostatic but afebrile and
was found to have acute renal failure with a BUN of 71,
creatinine up to 3.8 and a potassium of 6.6.  ABG at that
time showed PH of 7.18, PCO2 31 and a PO2 of 114.  EKG showed
peaked T waves.  She was given bicarbonate and Albuterol nebs
and hydrated with four liters of normal saline.  She then was
transferred to the MICU for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Ulcerative colitis status post
ileostomy in [**2097**].  2) Left BKA.  3) Aortic stenosis status
post porcine valve replacement.  4) Cardiac catheterization
in [**3-6**] showed no evidence of coronary artery disease.  5)
History of acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.  6)
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with the most recent
PFTs on [**2104-7-15**] showing an FVC of 54% predicted value and
FEV1 of 24% predicted value and an FEV1 to FVC ratio of 45%.
Patient's O2 sat is 91% at baseline on room air. 7)
Perioperative MI in [**2097**] with persistent Q's in leads 2, 3
and AVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
further evaluation and monitoring.

1.  Renal:  The patient's urinalysis was suggestive of a
urinary tract infection so she was started on a 3 day course
of Bactrim.  In addition, her creatinine was 3.8 which is up
from her baseline of 1.3 to 1.5.  This renal failure was felt
to be secondary to dehydration as her [**Doctor First Name **] was 0.1%.  She had
been hydrated in the MICU and her creatinine rapidly began to
normalize as well as her potassium.  By the time she had been
transferred out to the floor on the second hospital day, her
creatinine had come down to 1.9 from its admission value of
3.3.  Her creatinine continued to improve after being on the
regular medical floor. At the time of this discharge summary
her most recent BUN and creatinine values are BUN of 15 and
creatinine of 1.0 measured on [**11-26**].  Repeat urinalysis and
culture only showed some yeast which was likely secondary to
colonization from the Foley catheter.  The Foley catheter was
discontinued on the 7th hospital day as it had been left in
while the patient still had the femoral triple lumen catheter
in place.  The patient is incontinent at baseline.

2.  GI:  The patient was admitted with what was felt to be a
possible gastroenteritis and stool studies were sent which
eventually all came back negative.  Her ostomy output
decreased during her hospital stay and it was felt that
possibly her original increase in ostomy output may have been
secondary to ostomy dysfunction.  In addition, her ostomy
output was guaiac'd as she had a fairly significant drop in
hematocrit after her hospital admission from 46 down to 33
which was felt to be unlikely all due to dilutional effects.
The ostomy output was guaiac positive so GI was consulted for
possible EGD.  The GI recommendations include having an EGD
to look for possible upper source of bleeding as well as an
ileoscopy and a colonoscopy.  The ileoscopy is to evaluate
for possible ostomy dysfunction secondary to adhesions and
the colonoscopy should be done in order to screen for
possible cancer given the patient's longstanding history of
ulcerative colitis.  The patient did not want to undergo
these tests while an inpatient and as her hematocrit had
stabilized, it was felt this could be done as an outpatient.
Her ostomy output became guaiac negative and at the time of
this dictation it has been guaiac negative for several days.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient has a history of severe COPD.
She was getting some relief with nebulizer treatments upon
her transfer out to the floor but she still seemed more short
of breath than she usually is at baseline so a chest x-ray
was ordered.  The chest x-ray revealed a hydropneumothorax
secondary to the central line attempt of the internal jugular
vein when the patient was first admitted.  The
hydropneumothorax was found on the third hospital day after
the patient had been transferred out to the regular floor.
Given her low pulmonary reserve, the patient was transferred
back into the MICU for chest tube placement.  She tolerated
the procedure without any complications and was transferred
back out to the medical floor on the fourth hospital day.
She has been tolerating the chest tube well and at the time
of this discharge summary, she has had the chest tube in
place for 6 hosp
