Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with aortic valvuloplasty.


History of Present Illness:
Primary Cardiologist: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in [**Name9 (PRE) 86**]: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2539**], M.D.

This is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with known AS presents with dypsnea for
elective aortic valvuloplasty '[**36**], '[**38**].  After the valvuloplasty
in [**2138**] she was somewhat improved.  She was in her USOH (able to
walk about 100 feet before developing dyspnea, with 24 private
nurse) until late [**2140-10-10**] when she developed mild dyspnea
and was treated at a hospital in [**State 108**] for bronchitis.  She
improved somewhat but then had recurrent dyspnea and was
hospitalized in late [**11-12**] until [**2140-12-10**], and treated again for
bronchitis, discharged with home oxygen (at night) and a
prednisone taper (last dose 1 week ago).  She states that over
the past several weeks she has been limited to walking ~10 feet
before becoming short of breath.  She discussed this with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] who advised her to return from [**State 108**] for a
repeat valvuloplasty by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-7**].

POSITIVE: diffuse weakness, occasional left jaw pain and
left-sided chest pain at rest alleviated with belching,
paresthesias in the distal finger tips, occasional palpitations,
occasional diarrhea with lower ABD cramping
NEGATIVE: Fevers, Nausea, Vomiting, dysuria

Past Medical History:

Social History:
Patient splits her time in [**Location (un) 55**] and
[**Last Name (LF) 60966**], [**First Name3 (LF) 108**], where she is living currently.  She has a
remote history of tobacco use.  Drinks an occasional glass of
champagne.  She ambulates with a cane or a walker and has a
nurses aide ([**Female First Name (un) **]),
housekeeper and choufer at home who assist her with
heractivities of daily living.  She has been on home oxygen at
night since her discharge in [**12-14**].  Of note [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] was
her son's camp counselor.  Her son is the namesake for the
[**Name (NI) 25922**] Imax Theatre in [**Location (un) 86**].

CONCLUSIONS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
