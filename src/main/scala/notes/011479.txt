History of Present Illness:
58 y/o male with h/o mitral regurgitation for past 8-10 years
and has been followed by serial echocardiograms. Most recent
echo showed 3+ mitral regurgitation with partial posterior
mitral leaflet flail. He has been c/p dyspnea with very heavy

Physical Exam:
At discharge:
VS: 98.3  113/71  68SR   20  94%RA
Gen: NAD, WG, WN [**Male First Name (un) 4746**]
Chest: LCTAB
Heart: RRR, no murmur or rub
Abd: NABS, soft, non-tender, non-distended
Ext: trace edema
Neuro: grossly intact
Incision: sternotomy c/d/i without erythema or drainage

Pertinent Results:
[**11-12**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). 3. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is a
flail of the P2 segment. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully
coapt. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. 7. There is no pericardial
effusion. POST-BYPASS: Pt is in sinus rhythm and is on an
infusion of phenylephrine 1. Left and right ventricular function
is preserved. 2. The aorta is intact post decannulation. 3. The
patient is status post mitral valve repair, with P2 resection,
band annuloplasty, and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 84256**] stitch. There is now trivial
mitral regurgiation. The peak gradient of 2mmHg at cardiac
output of 5 L/min. 4. The remainder of the exam is unchanged.

Final Report
INDICATION: 58-year-old man status post chest tube removal.

COMPARISON: [**2182-11-12**]

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There has been removal of a Swan-Ganz
catheter,
endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, mediastinal drain, and
right-sided chest
tube. There is a residual tiny right apical pneumothorax.

The patient has had mitral valve replacement and median
sternotomy wires are
intact. There are expected post-operative changes including
linear
atelectasis at both lung bases.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107531**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On [**11-12**] he was brought
directly to the operating room where he underwent a mitral valve
repair. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Diuretics and beta blockers were initiated and he was gently
diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day one he was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. Chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol.
Beta-blocker was optimized. He continued to progress and was
discharged to home on POD # 4 All follow up apppointments were
advised.
