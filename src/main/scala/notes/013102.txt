CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Colocutaneous fistula.

PROCEDURE:
1. Exploratory laparotomy, splenic flexure take down,
    sigmoid colectomy, coloproctostomy.
2. Percutaneous abscess drainage.
3. Tracheostomy.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient was admitted earlier in the year
with severe complicating diverticulitis.  A percutaneous
drain was placed and that subsequently turned into a
colocutaneous fistula.  He was sent to rehab for nutritional
improvement and brought back for definitive surgical excision
of the fistula and re-establishment of bowel continuity.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
coronary artery disease, pacemaker, and gastritis.

MEDICATIONS:  Included Metoprolol, Protonix, Isosorbide
dinitrate, Plavix, enalapril, aspirin, gabapentin,
acetaminophen, and parenteral nutrition.

DISCHARGE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was
admitted on [**2147-4-14**].  He underwent his exploratory
laparotomy and bowel resection on [**2147-4-21**].  Prior to his
surgery, he underwent an IVC filter placement.  There was a
clot in his iliac vessels which was likely chronic that we
did not want to propagate and give him a pulmonary embolus.
His subsequent course was complicated by anastomotic leak
requiring percutaneous drainage.  He did not significantly
improve with this and surgical re-exploration was not
requested by the family.  Due to deterioration, he was made
comfortable and he subsequently expired on [**2147-5-7**].  A
post mortem exam was declined by the family.
