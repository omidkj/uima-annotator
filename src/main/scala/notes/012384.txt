Service:  CAR. [**Doctor First Name 147**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 69-year-old female with
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, history of lung cancer
and asthma who had episodes of band-like chest pain times
three on [**5-29**].  Upon arrival to the hospital was found
to have ST segment changes on her electrocardiogram and was
found to have a picture of unstable angina.  Was worked up
for possible myocardial infarction.  She was placed on
heparin, GGT, aspirin, statin and beta blocker.  Cardiac
catheterization believed OMCA distal involving LAD origin
50-60%, proximal LAD was 95% involved and the RCA had 95% in
the proximal.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Patient was afebrile at
98.1, blood pressure of 135/80, pulse 69, respiratory rate
20.  She was 98% on three liters.  She was in no acute
distress.  HEENT was unremarkable.  Lungs were clear.  Heart
was regular without rub or murmur.  Abdomen was soft,
non-tender with good bowel sounds.  Extremities did not show
any edema or calf tenderness.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  BUN and creatinine were 30 and 1.3
respectively with white count of 11.4 and hematocrit 35.7.
Platelet count was 388.  PT was 12.4, PTT was 24.2, INR was
1.0.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed ST segment depression in V2, V3
and V4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was taken to the Operating Room on [**5-30**] of [**2131**] where she underwent a three vessel coronary
artery bypass graft.  All the vein grafts were used.  The
first one was an saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending.  The next was an saphenous vein graft to
descending right coronary artery.  Next was saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal.  The patient crashed on
cardiopulmonary bypass.  Cardiopulmonary bypass times 159
minutes and crossclamp time was 77 minutes.  She was taken to
the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit postoperatively where she
was extubated on postoperative day three and had her drips
slowly weaned.  Her ejection fraction was found to be 65% on
TTE on postoperative day two.  She was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day four where she did receive blood
transfusion to increase her hematocrit but otherwise was
simply diuresed aggressively.  There were no other
postoperative complications noted.  In terms of labs, at the
time of discharge her final hematocrit improved to 29.2.
Otherwise BUN and creatinine were 36 and 1.0.
