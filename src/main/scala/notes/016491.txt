History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13972**] is a 79WM with PMH significant for CAD s/p [**2116**]
CABG, severe mitral [**Year (4 digits) **] regurgitation, h/o frontal/parietal
CVA's, and recent admission for [**Year (4 digits) 1902**] exacerbation, who presented
to Dr.[**Name (NI) 8664**] office today for a check-up. Since his discharge,
and over the last several months, Mr. [**Known lastname 13972**] has been
experiencing increasing fatigue and confusion. The psychiatry
team was consulted during his last admission in [**5-27**] for
possible contribution of depression, previous frontal CVAs, or
polypharmacy to his symptoms. An inpatient geripsych admission
was considered, but deferred, pending outpatient behavioral
neurology admission.  Evaluation by a behavioral neurologist was
performed on [**7-4**] with an assessment that his decline in
mentation was likely secondary to encephalopathy due to chronic
hypoperfusion and recommendation that his Florinef dose was
increased to 0.1 mg PO qD.
.
Since his mental status declined in spite of medical
optimization of his fluid status, it was speculated that his
low-output state would be best addressed by MVR, given his low
EF and severe MR. This is likely to be a high-risk procedure in
Mr. [**Known lastname 97473**] decompensated state, however, and thus Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
opted to admit Mr. [**Known lastname 13972**] to the CCU for tailored inotropic
therapy for his low-output [**Known lastname 1902**].  The goal of this admission is
to assess whether increased perfusion would improve his mental
status, prior to making a major decision about whether to
proceed with MVR. He was admitted directly to the CCU, and was
brought to the cath lab for placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter
under fluoroscopy.

Pertinent Results:
[**2124-7-10**] ECHO:
1. Right heart catheterization demonstrated severely elevated
filling
pressures with critically depressed cardiac output.  The resting
mean
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was severely elevated at
31mmHg, with
moderately elevated right atrial filling pressure of 16mmHg.
There was
moderate pulmonary hypertension with peak pulmonary artery
pressures of
55mmHg.  Cardiac index was critically depressed at 1.4 L/min/m2
(normal
is 2.5 L/min/m2).
2. Coronary angiography was attempted unsuccessfully due to
inability
to engage coronary arteries with 4 French multipurpose catheter.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Critically depressed cardiac index.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
.
[**2124-7-12**] ECHO:
1.The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]
3.The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. 4.The
aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral [**Month/Day/Year **] is normal. At least moderate to severe (3+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-6-16**],
the LVEF is
probably unchanged while the MR is possibly more severe. The RV
function may be worse.  TSI was performed. No significant
dyssnchrony was seen (60 ms).

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 79M with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG, [**Month/Day/Year 1902**] (EF
20-25), severe MR, and h/o CVA, presenting for tailored
low-output [**Month/Day/Year 1902**] therapy.
.
Plan:
1) CARDIAC:
A) Pump: EF assessed to be 20-25% in context of severe MR.  Upon
admission, a Swan-Ganz catheter placed for measurement of
hemodynamics and tailoring of low-output [**Month/Day/Year 1902**] therapy on
dobutamine. Tried on dobutamine and dopamine transiently, but
became tachycardic with no increase in MAP. Dopamine was d/c'ed,
and trial of vasopressin was initiated resulting in a slight
increase in BP, but significant decrease in CO and no notable
improvement in mental status.  He subsequently underwent a trial
of Levophed which resulted in pulmonary edema and decreased
urine output.  He was subsequently switched back to dobutamine
gtt only, with improvement in CO and clinical status but no
improvement in mentation.  Thus, it was concluded that lack of
sustained improvement in his mentation indicated a failed trial
of inotropic support for the purposes of mediating his
encephalopathy secondary to hypoperfusion.  He was gradually
titrated off the dobutamine and the swan ganz catheter was
removed.  Off pressor support, Mr. [**Known lastname 13972**] was able to maintain
a systolic BP in the 90's-100's for the remainder of his
hospitalization, which is improved from SBP's in the 80's on
admission.  He was evaluated by EP for placement of a BiV pacer;
however, due to lack of dyssynchrony on TTE, as well as
previously failed attempt to engage the CS, he was deemed to be
not a candidate.
     In the context of his end-stage heart failure, agressive
diuresis was continued throughout the hospital course.  His AceI
dose was titrated up to provide enhancement of the diuresis and
for known mortality and survival benefit. Both diuretics and his
AceI were titrated up to maximal levels tolerated while still
maitaining SBP in the high 90's to low 100's. He was not started
on a beta-blocker during this hospitalization due to report of
an adverse event in the past. He was discharged on a regimen
Lasix, Aldactone, and Lisinopril.
.
B) CAD: s/p CABG, likely has chronic hypoperfusion [**2-24**] low
output state, but no active ACS issues during this
hospitalization.  Mr. [**Known lastname 13972**] was continued on chronic therapy
with ASA, plavix, and statin and will be discharged on this
regimen.
.
C) Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname 13972**] remains in sinus rhythm with occasional
tachycardia to heart rates
