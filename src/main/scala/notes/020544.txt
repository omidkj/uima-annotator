Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Intubation and extubation
NGT placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 yo F with significant obesity who had a PEA
arrest in the Pilgrim garage. There the patient was coded and
taken to the ER. Given the arrest, the patient was taken
urgently to the cardiac cath lab.
.
Cath lab findings included no coronary artery disease, cardiac
index of 2.0 and a LVEDP and wedge of 25. PA diastolics were
elevated. Additionally echocardiogram showed diastolic
dysfunction and biventricular systolic dysfunction. While in the
cardiac cath lab, the patient was hypoxic with elevated airway
pressures. After albuterol administration, the patient improved.

.
On review of systems, not available as patient is intubated and
sedated. Family reports that the patient did not have chest
pain.
.
Family states that she was dx with asthma 1 month ago, no prior
hx. States the cold air caused SOB in the garage with tightness
of her chest. Also currently c/o leg cramp in right calf. Not a
smoker per pt/family, and was on albuterol and advair for her
asthma. Denies hx of heart disease, but had "murmur" as child.
Reports remote hx of lasix use in past.
In the ED, initial vitals were not recorded

Past Medical History:
asthma
gastric bypass sugery
bowel obstuctions in past per family
morbid obesity
hypertension

Social History:
Never smoked, divorced. Has mother, son and sister who are aware
of current care. Son has severe epilepsy. Partner is [**Name2 (NI) 81751**] pt
wants to have info shared with her in addition to family

CARDIOLOGY:
Admission echo
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20
%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular global systolic dysfunction.
Right ventricular hypertrophy with normal function.
.
Echo after extubation
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild to moderate
([**2-7**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-2-15**],
the aortic regurgitation is new (though prior study only had one
color Doppler aortic valve clip, there does not appear to be any
AR). The left ventricular systolic function is better viewed on
the current study, but was underestimated on review of the prior
study. Aortic stenosis is now identified. Is there a history to
suggest a primary aortic (e.g, dissection) or aortic valve
pathology (e.g., endocarditis
.
Cadiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated single vessel
coronary
artery disease.  The LMCA was without flow limiting disease.
The LAD
and LCX were without flow limiting disease. The RCA had 30%
stenosis at
the proximal segment and 40-50% stenosis at the origin of the
PDA.
There was no evidence of acute thrombosis.
.

RADIOLOGY:
CXR ([**2-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube tip positioned 6.1 cm above the carina.
Tube could be
advanced for more optimal positioning.
2. Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacification. Differential
considerations include pulmonary edema, multifocal pneumonia, or
other etiologies such as pulmonary hemorrhage or ARDS.
.
CT torso
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. Small right inguinal
hematoma
near insertion of central venous catheter. The catheter closely
approaches
and indents the wall of the common femoral artery adjacent to
its course into the common femoral vein, likely simply due to
proximity, but
reassessment with ultrasound is recommended after catheter
removal or if
hematoma appears to be enlarging clinically.

2. 4 mm subpleural right middle lobe pulmonary nodule requires
no further
workup if there is no history of malignancy or significant risk
factors for malignancy (i.e., smoking). If such history or risk
factors exist, consider a one-year followup chest CT to evaluate
for stability.
.
KUB
FINDINGS: There are air-filled loops of colon, without ileus or
obstruction. There is no massive free air. There is degenerative
change in the lumbar spine.

IMPRESSION: No ileus, obstruction, or massive free air.
.
CXR after extubation
IMPRESSION: Overall, interval improvement of congestion of
congestive heart failure with persistent mild congestion.
Interval removal of endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube. No
pneumothorax or pneumonia.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
Doppler of LEs [**2149-2-21**]-

IMPRESSION: Limited study, no evidence of DVT in the left lower
extremity
