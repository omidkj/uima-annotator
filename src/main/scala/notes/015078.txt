History of Present Illness:
74 y.o male with hx of COPD (FEV1 <50% expected), CHF (EF 30%),
CAD (cath '[**10**] showed 2 vessel disease; medical management) who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] emergency room on [**2115-2-24**] with a 6 day hx of
worsening SOB, nasal congestion, cough, generalized weakness and
fatigue, and low grade fevers to 100.0. Pt stated that he was at
his normal state of health when he went to his last [**Hospital 1902**] clinic
appointment on [**2115-2-18**]. The next day he began to have cold-like

CXR: [**2115-2-24**] FINDINGS: There is no cardiomegaly. There is
blunting of both lateral costophrenic angles without chagne,
consistent with pleural effusions vs pleural thickening. There
is upper lobe bullous change, with presumed crowding of lower
lobe structures. No definite consolidation or pulmonary edema.
No pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute change.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions vs pleural thickening.

ECHO [**2115-2-25**]: EF 35% The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are  normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with thinning/akinesis of the basal
half of the inferior and inferolateral walls.  The basal
inferior septum and distal inferior wall is hypokinetic. The
remaining segments contract well. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional
dysfunction c/w  CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the report of the
prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2114-5-7**], the
findings are similar.

LLE US [**2115-2-26**]: No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein
thrombus.
KUB [**2115-3-1**]: No evidence of bowel obstruction
Bilateral LE US [**2115-3-14**]: No evidence of lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis, bilaterally.

CT chest [**2115-3-14**]: IMPRESSION
1. Multifocal pneumonia, which is most prominent in the right
lower lobe, superimposed upon underlying emphysema.
2. Soft tissue mass, measuring 3.4 x 2.0 cm, abutting the
pleural surface in the anterior medial basilar segment of the
left lower lobe, which is highly concerning for primary lung
malignancy.
3. In the right lower lobe, adjacent to the area of pneumonic
consolidation, there is an area of soft tissue density adjacent
to the mediastinum, which does not demonstrate clear
air-bronchograms. This may represent a dense area of infectious
consolidation, early abscess formation, and, less likely, second
neoplastic mass. Follow/up evaluation of this is recommended
after clearing of the right lower lobe diffuse consolidation by
CXR.
4. Prominence of the right renal pelvis and right proximal
ureter. Further evaluation with renal ultrasound is recommended.

ECHO [**2115-3-15**]: Conclusions:
EF 30-40% The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D  or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (ejection fraction 30-40
percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterio walls (basal segments are akinetic). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral v
