CXR [**2149-11-29**]:
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
87 year old woman with bibasilar crackles w/ h/o chf
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o CHF
HISTORY: Bibasilar crackles, rule out CHF.

CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW. No previous chest x-rays on PACS record
for comparison.

The lungs are hyperinflated. There is moderate to moderately
severe cardiomegaly. There is subsegmental atelectasis and/or
scarring at both bases. There is minimal blunting of both
costophrenic angles. There is no CHF or frank consolidation. I
doubt the presence of an infectious infiltrate. There is right
upper hilar peribronchial cuffing. Linear atelectasis or
scarring noted in the right mid zone. An NG tube is present, tip
over proximal stomach. There is osteopenia and an old ununited
left clavicle fracture.

IMPRESSION: Hyperinflation and cardiomegaly. Right upper hilar
peribronchial cuffing. No CHF. Doubt acute infectious
infiltrate.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2149-11-29**] 4:59 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: r/o ich

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
87 year old woman with recent head trauma, INR 35
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ich
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT HEAD

INDICATION: Recent head trauma, INR 35.

No prior studies are available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: There is no intraparenchymal or extra-axial
hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally midline structures,
mass effect or hydrocephalus. There is mild prominence of the
ventricles and sulci consistent with age-related involutional
change. Encephalomalacic changes are demonstrated in the
anterior and medial portions of the frontal lobes bilaterally.
There is also encephalomalacic change demonstrated in the left
occipital lobe. Periventricular white matter hypodensities are
also noted consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic change.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and osseous structures are
within normal limits.

IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Encephalomalacic changes in the bifrontal lobes and left
occipital lobe.
.
CXR [**2149-11-29**]:
Atrial fibrillation
Modest nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay
Modest ST-T wave changes with probable QT interval prolonged
although is
difficult to measure - are nonspecific but clinical correlation
is suggested for possible in part metabolc/drug effect.
No previous tracing available for comparison

gastroscope
ID#: [**Numeric Identifier 62551**] ASA Class: P2
Medications: Cetacaine topical spray
Meperidine 25mg
Midazolam 1mg

Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered
Conscious sedation anesthesia. The patient was placed in the
left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope was introduced
through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until
the second part of the duodenum was reached. Careful
visualization of the upper GI tract was performed. The procedure
was not difficult. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
There were no complications.
Findings: Esophagus:
 Lumen: A small size hiatal hernia was seen.
 Excavated Lesions A single non-bleeding 6mm ulcer was found in
the gastroesophageal junction.
Stomach:
 Contents: Old blood was seen in the stomach. No sites of active
bleeding were identified.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Blood in the stomach
Ulcer in the gastroesophageal junction
Small hiatal hernia


Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo f w/ h/o CHF, HTN, fib, and h/o recent fall transferred
from OSH w/ likely UGI in setting of elevated INRX (on
Coumadin).
.
## UGI:  The patient's HCT was 16.3 with INR 32.3 at OSH. The
patient received 2 units of PR BC, Protonix 40 mg iv, and 10 mg
IV Vit K at the OSH.  Due to no ICU availability, the patient
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], her HCT was 25.2
with INR 2.1.  She received additional mg sc Vit K and 2 u FFP.
NG lavage showed coffee ground emesis followed by a pink-tinged
fluid. CT of head was neg for bleeds.  The patient was started
on Protonix 40 mg iv bid and observed overnight in the MICU, and
GI did not feel that urgent EGD was necessary as the patient was
hemodynamically stable with stable HCT after blood transfusion.
The patient was transferred to the floor in a hemodynamically
stable and hct was stable at 33.2.  EGD was performed on [**12-1**]
which showed an ulcer at GE junction and old blood in the
stomach without signs of active bleeding.  The patient was
switched to po Protonix [**Hospital1 **] after the procedure and hct
continued to remain stable at the time of discharge.  The
patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1356**], her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] decide on
when to restart coumadin and close monitor of INR when she gets
placed on coumadin again.
.
## CHF: After a total of 4 units of PRBC transfusion, the
patient became hypoxemic and require
