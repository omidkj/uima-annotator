History of Present Illness:
46 year-old woman with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
with metastases to brain). She is a patient of Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] and
[**Doctor First Name **] She is status post 1 cycle of Taxol/Carboplatin [**2165-10-17**],
15 session WBI ([**2165-9-22**]), and recently started cycle 2 of
[**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol ([**11-13**] was cycle 2, D1). For the past day, she has
had increased nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate POs. She
states that she has been feeling unwell since her admission on
[**11-7**]. Symptoms consist of nausea, vomiting (everything),
malaise, and fatigue. Denies abdominal pain, diarrhea or change
in bowel habits. Some 'low grade fevers' to 99 at home with
chills. No urinary symptoms. No urinary/bowel incontinence (had
1 episode of stool incontinence a few days prior with a loose
bm, has not recurred). Denies CP/SOB. She states that she is to
have an interventional procedure on Monday at [**Hospital1 112**] for on her
vocal cords. She recently completed course of antibiotics
(levo/clinda, finished the day prior to admission) for
aspiration pneumonia from her previous admission. She also
finished decadron taper yesterday for brain metastases/edema.
She states she had undesirable fatigue and myopathy from the
steroids and would not want to take these again.
.
In the ED, she was tachycardic and found to be orthostatic by
VS. She was given 2 L IVF (D5NS). CT head showed mets but no new
mets, no increased edema, and no mass effect. She was admitted
for nausea, vomiting, dehydration.
.
Of note, she had a recent INR that was 5; she held her coumadin
dose night prior to admission.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Recently diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer with metastases to
the brain. She was found to have a mass on CXR during a workup
for worsening hoarse voice in [**8-4**]. She then had a CT scan at an
OSH which revealed a R lower lobe infrahilar mass. She then had
a PET scan which showed this mass was FDG-avid, as were multiple
bilateral mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as supraclavicular
and cervical lymph nodes. Ms. [**Known lastname 8957**] was then seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of diagnostic procedure (likely
bronchoscopy +/- mediastinoscopy). She had an MRI as part of her
metastatic workup which revealed multiple brain metastases, the
largest of which was 1.5cm. She was not symptomatic, so nothing
was done urgently, but the plan was to proceed with the
bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy in order to obtain tissue for
diagnosis.
.
Unfortunately, on [**2165-9-3**], Ms. [**Known lastname 8957**] had loss of consciousness
and what sounds like a seizure at work. She reportedly stood up,
felt a "woozy" sensation, and then lost consciousness. Her
coworkers reported that she then fell to the ground and was
caught by coworkers. At that time, she was incoherent, her
teetch were clenched, and she could only intermittently answer
simple questions. There was no shaking movements, no tongue
biting, no urinary or bowel incontinence. She was taken by EMS
to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] hospital where a CT scan revealed edema in
the area of the L temporo-parietal region, which was the area of
the largest brain met seen on previous MRI. While in the ER, she
was given 10mg decadron and anzemet for nausea, but she had
another seizure witnessed by her husband. [**Name (NI) **] again described an
inability to answer questions and noted that her eyes rolled
back. She was loaded with fosphenytoin and had a repeat CT scan
which showed no additional change. She was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Of note, she had been taking wellbutrin
(which lowers the seizure threshold) up until Friday [**2165-8-30**] for
smoking cessation. Once discontinuing the wellbutrin, she felt
like she developed the HA and perioral numbness and tingling.
The seizure on [**2165-9-3**] was her first seizure ever.
.
She is now status post 1 cycle of Taxol/Carboplatin [**2165-10-17**] and
was due for her second cycle the day of admission. She is also
status post 15 session WBI.

CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-11-20**]
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in the size and
distribution of multiple intracranial metastases. No hemorrhage
or midline shift.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There has been a mild increase
in edema surrounding the left parietal and right thalamic
regions.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2165-11-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Posterior segment right upper lobe pneumonia. This may be the

IMPRESSION:
1. Rapid worsening of right middle and right lower lobe
