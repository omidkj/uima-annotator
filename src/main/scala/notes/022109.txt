Service:  PCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  85-year-old male with history of
coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft times two, the last being in [**5-/2165**], and a history of
multiple PCIs who presents with two days of intermittent
chest pain requiring more nitroglycerin to obtain resolution
of symptoms.  He denies shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea,
vomiting, radiation.

When he came to the Emergency Department his chest pain was
described as severity of [**2-5**].  He was started on a
nitroglycerin drip and a Heparin drip.  He became pain free
in the Emergency Department.  While in the Emergency
Department he developed chest heaviness, increasing chest
pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, satting in the low
90s.  An EKG at the time showed dynamic ST depressions in V5
through V6 with ST elevations V1 through V3.  The
nitroglycerin drip was increased and Integrilin was added.
He continued to have chest pain and went to the Cardiac
Catheterization Lab for a PCI.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft times two, last [**5-/2165**], with multiple PCIs.
2.  Type 2 diabetes.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  History of transient ischemic attack.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  Peptic ulcer disease.
8.  History of glaucoma.
9.  Iron-deficiency anemia.
10. Gout.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 once a day.
2.  Plavix 75 once a day.
3.  Lipitor 20 once a day.
4.  Lisinopril 5 once a day.
5.  Coreg 37.5 twice a day.
6.  Imdur 30 once a day.
7.  Lasix 20 once a day.
8.  Lantus 12.
9.  Glucophage 750 in the morning, 1000 at p.m.
10. Folate one once a day.
11. Colace 100 twice a day.

ALLERGIES:  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

SIGNIFICANT LABORATORY DATA:  Potassium 5.5, creatinine 1.2,
BUN 39.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:  Right heart catheterization:  Right
atrium 8, right ventricle 29/5, pulmonary artery 30/8, wedge
7.  Left heart cardiac catheterization showed left main with
patent stent, left anterior descending with 70% proximal
occlusion, left circumflex 90% occlusion at the origin
proximal 80% occlusion right coronary artery to mid patent,
saphenous vein graft to LPL with mid 90%, distal 80%
occlusion with thrombus, left internal mammary artery graft
to LAD patent.

Chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure, small left
pleural effusion.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AFTER CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
Afebrile, blood pressure 128/58, pulse of 87, respirating 16,
98% on 3 liters.  Exam significant for well appearing,
elderly male in no acute distress.  Mucous membranes moist.
Elevated jugulovenous pressure in supine position.  Rales at
left base.  Normal S1, S2.  Benign abdomen.  No peripheral
edema.  Good dorsalis pedis pulses.  Right groin site without
hematoma or a bruit.  Neuro:  Examined and found to be
intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  85-year-old male who is status post
coronary artery bypass graft and multiple PCIs presents with
ST elevation myocardial infarction requiring cardiac
catheterization that showed patent LIMA to LAD, occluded SVG
to LPL.  His mid and distal SVG to LPL were stented.  He was
admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.

1.  Coronary artery disease:  Status post stent times two to
SVG to LPL.  Patient remained chest pain free after
procedure.  He was continued on aspirin, Plavix, beta
blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.  His
CPK peaked at 249.  His Lipitor was increased.

2.  Diabetes:  His Metformin was held for a few days to
protect his kidney function from dye nephropathy.  One dose
of Metformin was held for a few days. He had a few episodes
of hypoglycemia, and therefore his Lantus dose was decreased
in half while his creatinine was elevated.

3.  Acute renal failure:  His creatinine peaked at 2.4.  It
appears that this may be related to receiving contrast.  His
creatinine was trending down on discharge.  His ACE inhibitor
was held and restarted when his creatinine trended back down
towards normal.  Upon discharge his creatinine was 1.6.  His
Lasix and ACE inhibitor were restarted prior to discharge.
In addition, his Lantus dose was increased prior to
discharge.

4.  Anemia:  He was transfused two units of packed red blood
cells and his hematocrit remained stable throughout the rest
of his hospitalization.

5.  Infectious Diseases:  Patient had low-grade temperatures
and a cough with yellow sputum.  He was started on
antibiotics for presumed tracheal bronchitis.  This was
renal-dosed antibiotics.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute coronary syndrome.
2.  ST elevation myocardial infarction.
3.  Diabetes.
4.  Anemia.
5.  Contrast nephropathy.
6.  Hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Carvedilol 37.5 p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. h.s.
4.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Imdur 30 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. day.
9.  Eye drops as previously directed.
10. Lantus 12 units subcutaneously h.s.
11. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q. day.
12. Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. 24 hours for five days.
