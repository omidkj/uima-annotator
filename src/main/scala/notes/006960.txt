Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old
female with a history of CAD, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2197-1-31**] with LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA,
SVG to OM, and SVG to diagonal to OM 2.  The patient also has
a history of PAF, hypertension, CHF.  The patient also has a
history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and
hypercholesterolemia.  In [**2197-10-1**], the patient had
stents placed from the SVG to the PDA and SVG to the diagonal
to OM2.  The patient was recently hospitalized from [**2198-6-21**]
to [**2198-6-23**] with acute pulmonary edema.  She ruled in for MI
with peak CK of 107, MB index of 12.  She was found to have
anterolateral T wave inversions.  An echocardiogram at the
outside hospital showed inferoseptal hypokinesis and an EF of
40%.  Catheterization showed a 40% left main lesion, diffuse
LAD lesions, 70% diagonals, patent LIMA to LAD, patent
diagonal to OM2, SVG jump graft.  The patient was found to
have total occlusion of the RCA and total occlusion of her
SVG to diagonal.  The patient had PTCA and drug-eluding
stents of the RCA and native OM with resolution of TIMI-III
flow.

Of note, the stents that were placed in [**2197-10-1**],
being the SVG to diagonal in addition to the SVG to PDA were
completely blocked off.

The patient now presents with the same substernal chest pain
that she initially had on presentation in [**2198-5-31**].  The
patient's pain started on Saturday, [**2198-6-30**].  The pain
was up to [**8-9**], radiating to the left breast, no diaphoresis,
nausea, vomiting, palpitations.  The patient was admitted to
[**Hospital 487**] Hospital on [**2198-7-2**] with dizziness, transferred to
the ICU as her pain got worse.  Of note, the patient has been
faithfully taking Ticlid with Benadryl, despite having bad
side effects including dizziness and headache.  The patient
is generally allergic to Plavix and Ticlid and gets a rash in
response to these medications.

On [**2198-7-4**], the patient had pain all day at rest, no worse
with activity.  She was started on nitroglycerin, heparin,
Integrelin drip.  She received some relief with nitroglycerin
and morphine.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation and possible catheterization. Currently,
the patient states that her pain is [**6-9**], no nausea,
vomiting, fevers, chills, diarrhea, constipation, melena, or
bright red blood per rectum.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.6, pulse 74, blood pressure 146/47, respiratory rate 24,
02 saturation 100%.  General:  The patient was in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes slightly dry.  Neck:  5
cm JVP, no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left upper
sternal border.  Lungs:  Inspiratory crackles on the left,
clear on the right.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds.  Hemoccult negative.  Extremities:
Warm, 1+ PT and DP pulses bilaterally.  Bilateral femoral
bruits are noted.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times
three.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 10.6, hematocrit
26.2, platelets 332,000.  INR 1.2.  Sodium 140, potassium
4.5, chloride 110, bicarbonate 19, BUN 26, creatinine 1.2,
down from 1.7.  CK 30.  Calcium 9.1, magnesium 1.8,
phosphorus 3.1.

EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats per minute,
normal axis and intervals, 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation in V1,
question of J point elevation, T wave inversion in V4 through
V6.  There was no change from EKG on [**2198-6-23**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is an 84-year-old female
with a history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes, CAD,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, status post four vessel
coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2197-1-31**], status
post stenting of SVG to diagonal and SVG to PDA in [**2197-10-1**] with closure of the stents, recent rule in for MI,
with stenting of RCA and native OM two vessels.  The patient
now presents with progressive chest pain times three to four
days.

1.  CAD:  The patient's chest pain was not thought to be
cardiac initially.  Although the pain was similar to the pain
that she had during her MI in [**2198-5-31**], it was unusual in
that the pain lasted all day.  Also, the pain was no worse
with activity.  Finally, the pain was relieved by Tylenol.
The patient had no new EKG changes, and her CKs remained flat
and she ruled out for MI.  Based on this, it was unlikely
that she had any rethrombosis or in-stent restenosis with the
new stents.  However, given the possibility of OM involvement
and the difficulty of picking up posterior ischemia on EKG,
we could not totally rule out a cardiac source.  The patient
was initially kept on heparin, Integrelin, and nitroglycerin.
Once she ruled out, these medications were weaned.  The
patient was responding well to Tylenol and eventually was
pain-free.

The patient received a stress test on [**2198-7-6**], an exercise
MIBI.  The patient exercised up to 85% of her maximum heart
rate on the ten minute modified [**Last Name (un) 37450**] protocol.  The patient
was found to have moderately reversible perfusion defects in
the lateral, inferior, distal, and anterior walls with an EF
of 47%.  Based on this, the patient went to catheterization
on [**2198-7-9**].  She was found to have discreet 30% RCA lesion.
Her RCA and native OM stents were totally intact.  Otherwise,
her catheterization was unchanged.

Otherwise, the patient's Lopressor was titrated up as
tolerated.  The patient was placed back on Ticlid but she
refused to take it siting that it makes her feel terrible
with dizziness, severe headache.  She also refused to take
Benadryl because of its unwanted side effects.

2.  PUMP:  The patient has a history of CHF.  Her most recent
EF was 47%.  The patient is normally on Bumex 2 mg p.o. q.d.
and Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.  Her diuretics were held while
in-house secondary to blood pressure concern.  The patient
did not develop any significant CHF during her
hospitalization even though she was off these diuretics.  The
patient was restarted on Aldactone on discharge.

3.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have a drop in her
hematocrit on presentation from 31 to the outside hospital to
26.  The patient's baseline is at 30.  Given her history of
CAD and possible ischemia, the patient was transfused 2 units
with an appropriate bump.  Of note, the patient was noted to
have red streaked stool.  She does have a history of
hemorrhoids.  The patient's hematocrit remained stable.
Given that the stool was streaked on the outside, this was
consistent with hemorrhoids rather than a GI bleed.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 37.5 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Ticlid times two weeks, may take with Benadryl if needed.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Colace.
7.  Protonix.
8.  Glucotrol 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to follow-up with her
PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **], we have encouraged her to stay on the Ticlid for
at least two weeks.  She understands that she is very prone
to in-stent restenosis if she does not
