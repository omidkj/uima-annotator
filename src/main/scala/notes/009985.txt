History of Present Illness:
PER ADMITTING RESIDENT:
Information for the note was taken from the medical records from
[**Hospital6 204**] as well as the patient's daughter.
HPI: 50 year old male with significant medical problems,
including AFib noncompliant on coumadin, CAD s/p stent placement
x6, CHF with diastolic dysfunction, HTN, morbid obesity,
alcoholism, and DM was transferred from [**Hospital6 204**]
for possible intervention following CVA. Briefly, he presented
to
[**Hospital6 204**] ED by ambulance on the morning of
[**2142-11-19**] complaining of 2 days of general malaise and abdominal
pain and one bout of emesis. He was prompted to call the
ambulance after an episode of near syncope during micturition as
well as tinnitus. He was noted to be hypotensive upon arrival to
the ED, which resolved following fluid boluses. Work-up in the
ED
with a head CT showed likely old parietal infarct and possible
area of low attenuation in the central pons (?infarct). CT of
the
abdomen and chest showed no evidence of aortic dissection. On
presentation his INR was 1.0, PT 10.5s and PTT 26.1s.
At 11:35am on [**2142-11-19**] he was noted to have transient slurring
of
his speech, with normal upper and lower extremity strength,
tone,
and sensation bilaterally. He also had labile blood pressures,
becoming hypertensive to 220/135.
At 18:00 his speech was still slurred with decreased LUE and LLE
strength ([**5-29**] -> [**4-29**]). Tone and sensation were normal and intact
at that time.
At 20:00 he began to have an expressive language difficulty
along
with his slurred speech. His tongue was noticed to deviate to
the
right, with right facial drooping as well as drooping of the
right side of his mouth. He also had a poor cough and difficulty
clearing his secretions. LUE and LLE strength were decreased to
[**3-29**]. Tone in LUE and LLE was flaccid. Sensation was intact.
At 06:00 on [**2142-11-20**] His gag reflex was absent and his LUE
strength was [**3-1**], still with flaccid tone.
At 08:00 he was unable to keep his right eye closed against
resistance and his LUE and LLE sensation was decreased.
MRI and MRA of the head and neck on the morning of [**11-19**] showed
possible basilar artery thrombosis with multiple infarcts in the
brainstem and cerebellar hemispheres.
He was note to have abssent gag later in morning and he was
intubated prior to arrival in ICU for airway protection.

Physical Exam:
ON ADMISSION:
T-afebrile BP-140/90 HR-85, irregular O2Sat-97% on ventilator
Gen: Lying in bed, intubated, drowsy
HEENT: NC/AT,anicteric
Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid
or vertebral bruit
CV: afib with heart rate 80s no murmurs/gallops/rubs
Lung: decreased air entry on left
aBd: +BS soft, nontender
ext: no edema / cyanosis

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Intubated , drowsy however follows commands such
as opening eyes , moving limbs. Other exam diificult owing to
intubated status. .

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 2 to 1 mm
bilaterally..Extraocular movements
intact bilaterally, no nystagmus. trapezius normal bilaterally.
slight facial droop on right but difficcult to characterise
given
intubated status

Motor:
Limited owing to intubated and sedated status. He was actively
moving his right arm and leg , was not actively moving his left
UL. However partially cooperated with power testing. he was
noted
to have full power in all major muscle groups on right and was
antigravity on LUL in deltoids and triceps but not against
resistance, same was noted in LLL in IP and hamstrings.


Sensation: withdraws to pain BL

Reflexes:
Hyper-reflexic throughout, L more than R with left toe downgoing
and right toe mute

Coordination: unable to test
Gait: deferred

Neurological exam at time of discharge:

Awake, alert.  PEG and Tracheostomy in place.

Brief General exam: Obese, L subclavian line.  CTA b/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/[**Last Name (un) 3526**],
no m/g/r. Obese, soft abdomen, NTTP.  Edematous in yuEs and LEs,
non-pitting.

Pt. nods and shakes head but irreproducibly to questions and
requests.  Does not follow commands reproducibly. Titubation
after nodding his head persists for seconds.

EOMi, 3->2mm b/l, brisk, symmetric face, tongue to midline
(responds to mimicking).

Spontaneous fingermovement in L hand.  Noxious stim. to RUE
leads to withdrawal flexor of the LUE.  [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 83573**] to noxious
bilaterally.  L foot wiggles toes spontaneously, R to noxious
only responds with grimace.  Toes extensor bilaterally.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive confluent and multifocal infarcts involving the

aspect of both cerebellar hemispheres, with signal
characteristics suggesting that these are "late-acute" or
