EKG in ED: Sinus rhythm. Borderline left axis deviation.
Non-specific T wvae changes diffusely. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

Admission Chest-X-ray ([**10-8**]): Alveolar opacities in the right
perihilar, right infrahilar, left suprahilar and left lower lung
zones. They may represent multifocal pneumonia or asymmetric
pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette is mostly obscured.
There is evidence of median sternotomy. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions. The right lung apex is obscured by
the patient's chin. The visualized osseous structures are
demineralized. Degenerative changes are noted in the left
glenohumeral joint.

Relevant studies in hospital:

[**10-9**] CXR (portable): Persistent left upper and left lower zone
opacities and small left pleural effusion. While these left lung
opacities may represent areas of pneumonia, appearances,
especially of the left upper lobe opacity, is somewhat atypical
and further follow up or CT scan if clinically indicated may be
helpful to better evaluate.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year-old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen, CAD
status post CABG, history of aortic stenosis status post aortic
valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation,
presenting with increased fatigue, lethargy, and shortness of
breath.

In the ED, Ms. [**Known lastname 56988**] received Solumedrol 125 mg IV X1, ASA 325
mg PO X1, Lasix 40 mg PO X1, NTG, MSO4, Levofloxacin 500 mg IV
x1 and Cefepime 1 gm IV X1. Her hospital course on the floor
will be reviewed by problems.

1. Infectious Disease:
Given the above CXR and urinalysis results, Ms. [**Known lastname 56988**] was
initially started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin IV ([**2162-10-9**])
for coverage of community acquired pneumonia and urinary tract
infection, with rapid clinical improvement. The CXR was reviewed
with the radiologist to clarify the possibility of atypical
edema versus pneumonia. Given the patient's high WBC, rapid
improvement on the antibiotics and lagging CXR picture on a
repeat CXR on [**10-9**], multifocal pneumonia was felt to be the
more likely etiology.
