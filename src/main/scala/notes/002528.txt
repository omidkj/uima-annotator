Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1654**]
Chief Complaint:
mouth bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
85F with extensive medical history most notable for CVA with
residual left hemiparesis, and PCV had 5 teeth pulled in upper
gum on day prior to admission. She experienced persistent
bleeding. She was reportedly seen by her dentist, who stated
that the suture line was intact and there is no further
intervention possible. Pt c/o swallowing blood but denies
n/v/light-headedness.
.
In ED, her initial vitals were 97.6, 78, 121/66, 16, and 99% on
RA. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout her time
there. She did spike a temp to 100.8 at 11:30 pm on [**12-12**].
There, multiple attempts were made at stopping the bleeding; she
had near-constant pressure, placement of gelfoam, vitamin K 5mg
SC, 4 units of FFP, surgicel, afrin, silver nitrate, suture
placed, and she received 2units of PRBC for a Hct drop of 42.4
to 31.5. She was also agitated and was placed in restraints and
given Haldol 2.5mg IV. She
was also started on several antibiotics, including flagyl,
unasyn, levoflox, clinda, ceftriaxone, [**1-31**] findings of UTI and
possible aspiration PNA.
.
Concerning her persistent bleeding, Dental/OMFS was consulted
and
there was no response. ENT was consulted, but reported that
there was no further intervention to be done other than
correcting her coagulopathy.
.
She has not had any known history of bleeding disorder. ED and
Heme/Onc have been in touch with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] confirmed that she

has not had any history of bleeding before. She was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management with Heme/Onc following.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course:
.
No evidence of DIC or hemolysis (LDH (277 -> 421), bili (0.7),
retic (2) haptoglobin (54 -> 71)). FDP 0-10, Fibrinogen
190->283. Hct continued to slowly drop, requiring several
additional transfusions of PRBC. Pt remained hemodynamically
stable throughout. Smear w/o evidence of hemolysis except for
rare schistos. Platelets normal. No evidence of liver disease on
smear (no targets, etc). LFTs normal. Has no h/o liver disease
or problems w/ synthetic function. No report of poor nutrition
from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab records. No recent h/o heparin, coumadin, or
other anticoagulants. ASA and hydrea held. continued
allopurinol.
.
Vitamin K SC initially given, then started on vitamin K 10mg IV
qD x 3 days (started on [**12-14**]). Also given Amicar 4-5g IV bolus
over one hour, followed by 1g/hr for 8hrs. Visible bleeding
resolved on [**12-14**] and has not recurred since.
.
Wbc count quite elevated throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course, up to 40.
Possibly [**1-31**] infection (UTI or aspiration PNA) vs stress
response from bleed, though by report, chronically elevated. Tx
with levo (started [**12-13**]) and flagyl (started [**12-15**]) for
possible aspiration PNA (10 day course). No evidence of
progression to AML/MDS on smear.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] also experienced hypernatremia to 150. Given D5W. She
was kept NPO for first day in-house out of concern of gingival
bleeding. Was started on liquid diet on [**12-15**].

She was transferred to the floor on [**12-15**], and continued to do
well. She had no additional bleeding. Her hydrea and ASA were
restarted. A mixing study was sent, with results pending at time
of d/c. Received 3 days IV vitamin K, with slight improvement of
her INR. INR should be f/u, and Vit K given as necessary. Hct
should be checked periodically to ensure Ms. [**Known lastname **] has no
additional bleeding.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] also continued to be treated for pan-sensitive UTi and
possible aspiration PNA. Blood cultures continued to be negative
at time of D/c, and pt was C. diff neg
