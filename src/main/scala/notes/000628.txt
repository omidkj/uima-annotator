Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
sent from living facility for delusions

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
89 yo man with CAD, prostate ca s/p suprapubic catheter placed
[**11/2187**], and anemia, presents from nursing home with 2 days of
delusional thinking. Per the patient, one of the nurses accused
him of calling her a bad name, and out of anger she was trying
to give him harmful medicaitons. He reports that he was "lucky
to have survived." Rest home records indicate that the patient
was referring to a man named "shadow" who was trying to poison
him. Records also indicate that the patient was caught with an
empty bottle of Kahlua recently.
.
Of note he was sent to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on [**2188-9-19**] for
hypotension (BP 86/50s), vomiting, and diaphoreseis, but had
negative workup and sent home.
.
In the ED, vs= T 98, BP 115/59, HR 72, RR 15, 97%ra. He was
noted to have moderate leuks on UA, so infectious cause of
delirium/psychosis was thought to be likely. He was given Cipro.
Also, he had troponin of 0.05 with new TWI in V2-V6, but no
chest pain. He was given Aspirin 325 and Metoprolol 50mg (home
dose). CXR negative for acute process. Admitted for UTI and
ROMI.
.
ROS: Denies recent fevers or chills, nausea or vomiting, chest
pain or shortness of breath. Does report pelvic pain, is unsure
how long it has been going on.

Other ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of

[**2188-9-29**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
89 y.o. man with h/o CAD, suprapubic catheter, here with likely
catheter infection and new ischemic EKG changes.
.
Pelvic pain: On presentation, the patient complained of new pain
at the site of his suprapubic catheter.  He later complained of
penile and perineal pain.  UA showed bacteria and WBC.   He was
persistenly afebrile, with no elevated WBC count, and no CVA
tenderness. He was treated with ciprofloxacin.  Urology was
consulted.  They changed the suprapubic catheter and commented
that the bacteria represented normal colonizers of a bladder
with an indwelling catheter and were unlikely to be pathologic
and did not require treatment beyond 24 hours past the time of
catheter change.  Ciprofloxacin was discontinued accordingly. A
PSA was sent for routine post-prostatectomy screening and was
found to be undetectable.
.
CAD:  EKG showed ischemic changes new from previous tracing
06/[**2188**].  Troponins were mildly positive at .05.  Records from
[**Hospital 882**] hospital were obtained, showing that EKG at the current
admission was unchanged from an ED visit there [**2188-9-19**] when the
patient was noted to be hypotensive.  The most likely cause of
the EKG changes was deduced to be an ischemic event around the
time of that ED visit.  Given the patient's multiple medical
comorbidities and the fact that he was asymptomatic, no stress
test was performed.  Troponins were flat.  Medical management of
CAD was optimized, including continuation of ACEI, BB, increase
of statin (LDL 136) and addition of ASA.
.
Pulseless arrest and ICU course:  Pt was transfered to the MICU
after being found unresponsive and pulseless on the floor. On
the day of transfer, the pt was expressing increasing
frustration with his care and wanted to go home. He packed up
his belongings as if to go home, but his primary team was able
to convince him to stay. Due to his agitation, he received an
extra dose of 2.5mg Zydis Zyprexa (he takes 2.5mg at bedtime
nightly). About 1.5 hours later, a CODE BLUE was called when the
pt was found unresponsive by his RN. The primary team was first
to respond, and noted that he was pulseless, diaphoretic, and
hypoxic on arrival. Compressions were initiated, and the pt
immediately responded. CPR was stopped, and evaluation revealed
normal laboratories from the morning, FSBS 171, and ECG with new
QTc prolongation compared to admission. The patient was treated
with Magnesium 2g, and was transferred to the ICU for closer
monitoring of his QTc.  The most likely cause of the arrest was
thought to be long-QT-induced arrhythmia secondary to the
combination of ciprofloxacin and olanzapine, although there was
no telemetry documentation of any abnormal rhythm.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the pt was significantly agitated. He was
responding to voice, but unable to speak coherently. Labs were
drawn and he was settled in, after which he complained of vague
mild abdominal "soreness" that had resolved. ROS was otherwise
negative at the time. KUB was unremarkable.
.
He recovered quickly and was returned to the floor in stable
condition.  He was monitored on telemetry for the remainder of
his stay without further events.
.
Hypertension: The patient was initially hypertensive to the
180's
