Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111638**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a subtotal gastrectomy, repair of a hiat
[**Doctor Last Name **] hernia, and partial fundoplication on [**9-9**] with no
intra-operative complications, she had an epidural catheter
placed for pain control by the Anesthesia pain service.
Post-operatively she had oxygenation issues with desaturation to
the 80's when weaning from a 70% face mask. The patient reported
home oxygenation use of 3 liters nasal cannula as needed for her
COPD. A chest x-ray demonstrated collapse of left lower lobe and
atelectasis of right middle lobe, aggressive pulmonary toileting
was initiated. She experienced tachycardia and hypotension which
responded to intravenous fluid bolusing and beta-blockade. Her
pain control was not effective from the epidural on POD 1, this
was removed and a Dilaudid PCA was instituted along with
intravenous Toradol. She was transferred to the intensive care
unit for further management.
On POD 2 her home COPD medications were resumed and she was
oxygenating well on 15 liters non-rebreather mask.  However, cxr
showed total collapse of RML and LLL for which she [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a
bronchoscopy by Thoracic surgery with removal of heavy
secretions in right lower lobe. Post-bronch CxR looked
unchanged.  A Diltiazem drip was started for her tachycardia
with good rate control. She received a transfusion of one unit
packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 27, a repeat
hematocrit improved to 30.9 and she remained hemodynamically
stable.
On POD 3 a repeat chest x-ray showed mild improvement in
aeration of right middle lobe and left lower lobe with residual
atelectasis after bronchoscopy. She was stable on a
non-rebreather mask, but continued to experience desaturation
with exertion.
On POD 5 she had +flatus, remained afebrile, and her diet was
advanced to liquids. Her heart rate was controlled on oral
Diltiazem and her oxygen was continually weaned. Serial chest
x-rays demonstrated bibasilar atelectasis and chest physical
therapy continued. On POD 6 she had +flatus with a bowel
movement, she was tolerating a regular diet, her pain was well
controlled on Percocet, but her transfer from the intensive care
unit was held secondary to an episode of tachycardia and
desaturation. Chest x-ray showed worsening of left opacification
at the lung bases  and worsening atelectasis with small pleural
effusions with findings are unchanged on the right.

She was stable for transfer to an in-patient nursing floor on
POD 7, she was oxygenating well on 4 liters nasal cannula. Later
in the day on POD 7 she had another episode of tachycardia and
desaturation to the 80's while ambulating without oxygen. An
electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia and she was
treated with beta-blockade and calcium channel blocker. Her
oxygenation improved with rest and a non-rebreather mask, a
chest x-ray showed persistent atelectasis, right lobe greater
than left lobe; pulmonary consult was placed. Her white blood
cell count was elevated to 16k, a urine culture was sent after
replacing her foley catheter since her urine output was found to
be low and she received an intravenous fluid bolus with good
response. She had a + urine culture (see pertinent results) and
she was started on Ciprofloxacin. The pulmonary service
recommended continuing her nebulizer treatments, increased
ambulation and chest physical therapy, and a possible repeat
bronchoscopy on [**9-19**] if no improvement on x-ray.

On POD 8 she was oxygenating well on 3 liters nasal cannula and
had another episode of tachycardia, cardiac enzymes were
negative, and she was transfused a unit of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit of 25.3. Lopressor and Diltiazem were
continued. On POD 9 her chest x-ray had improved, she remained
afebrile and her white blood cell count was 15k. On POD 10 her
chest x-ray showed continued improvement in atelectasis, she was
stable on 3 liters nasal cannula, and out of bed ambulating with
assistance; the pulmonary team decided not to perform
bronchoscopy since she had overall improvement in her
respiratory status. The Ciprofloxacin was discontinued since she
completed three days of treatment.

Her cardiac medications were adjusted to maintain her systolic
blood pressure at 90mmhg or greater and her heart rate was
controlled in the 80's with Metoprolol twice daily and Diltiazem
every six hours.

Calorie counts were checked from POD [**10-31**] to make sure patient
was getting adequate nutrition.  On POD 11 her calorie count was
less than 200, on POD 12 it was 550, and on POD 13 it was 850.
It was decided that the patients poor PO intake was secondary to
education and was improving.  Therefore we decided not to place
a feeding jejunostomy and she was discharged home on POD 14 with
home PT services for physical therapy and home oxygen
management.  She was instructed to continue all previous
medications except sucralfate, and was discharged with
prescriptions for percocet, colace, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], and
diltiazem 60 QID.  She will follow-up with her PCP within [**Name Initial (PRE) **] week
regarding the new medications, the tachycardia, and her home O2
use.  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well in 2 weeks.
