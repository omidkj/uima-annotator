Chief Complaint:
Vomiting & Dark Diarrhea

Upper endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 84 year old male with a history of CAD (s/p cypher to
RCA in [**2166**]), recent AAA repair in [**6-14**], HTN, hyperlipidemia,
COPD, PUD who presents from his NH on [**8-16**] with vomitting,
abdominal pain and dark stools. He notes that several days ago,
he began to have nausea, vomitting, loose stools and abdominal
pain. Due to these symptoms he has had limited PO intake. He was
brought to the ED due to persistent loose stools and abdominal
pain.
.
In the ED: VS 97.2 102 101/66 20 100% RA. He had a CTA that
showed a duodenitis and absence of dissection. He was given
Cipro 400mg IV x1, Flagyl 500mg IV x1 given for duodenitis. He
was initially admitted with a hct to 30, and then the following
AM noted to have hct to 22. He was given 1 unit pRBC for this
and transfered to the MICU, though he was hemodynamically stable
throughout. Plan was for patient to undergo an EGD, but this
procedure was held due to a coagulopathy with an INR to 2.3. He
was given 5mg PO vitamin K and 2 units of FFP (INR down to 1.6).
During his blood product transfusion, he developed chest pain
that was left sided, and associated with mild SOB. His ECG
revealed inferolateral ST depressions. His chest pain
self-resolved. Troponins trended from 0.04 to peak of 0.11, most
recently down to 0.1 so no longer being followed. CKs and CK-MB
have been flat throughout. Thought to be consistent with demand
ischemia. Cardiology was consulted and recommended conservative
management with holding ASA and continuing BB.
.
In the MICU, patient received a total of 6 units prbcs, and
eventually hematocrit began to stabilize and increase over the
last 24 hours. Additionally became hypertensive, currently on
BB, started on hydralazine for easy on/off if he develops
hemodynamically significant re-bleed. At this time, patient is
transfered to the medicine floor with plan for EGD in the
morning pending stable INR (1.4 yesterday).
.
At this time, patient is feeling well. No BM for several days,
feels he has more energy. No nausea or vomiting. His only
complaint is his chronic arthritis for which he requests
tylenol. No fevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain,
shortness of breath.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is infero-lateral hypokinesis. The remaining LV
segments appear hyperdynamic and therefore the overall left
ventricular systolic function is preserved (LVEF = 55%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-10-18**],
the LVEF has improved.

CTA CAP:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or endograft leak s/p aortic
aneurysm
endograft repair.
2. Focal thickening in the duodenum with some adjacent fat
stranding,
suggestive of duodenitis.
3. Interval improvement in the left lower lobe consolidation.
4. Air in the bladder. Correlate for recent catheterization.
Otherwise, may represent infection. Correlate with urinalysis.

EGD findings:
Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Diffuse continuous moderate inflammation of the mucosa
with no bleeding was noted in the antrum.
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: Diffuse continuous marked inflammation of the mucosa
with no bleeding was noted throughout the duodenum.
 Excavated Lesions A single cratered non-bleeding 20mm ulcer was
found in the proximal bulb. A small visible vessel was present
in the center of the ulcer. Clipping was attempted, but three
endoquick clips were non-adherent. Some oozing was noted after
the clipping attempt, 4cc of epinephire were injected at the
ulcer border at three separate sites.
Impression: Moderate inflammation in the antrum
Marked inflammation in the duodenum
Ulcer in the proximal bulb
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
# GI Bleed:  Patient presented with 4 day history of vomiting
and melena without any PO intake and abdominal pain.  On his
first night he displayed no symptoms.  The following morning,
pt's INR was found to be 2.3. Hematocrit dropped to 22 from 30.2
EGD Cancelled. 2 U FFP transfused followed by 2 units PRBCs in
preparation for EGD. During administration of 1st unit of blood,
called to bedside for a trigger: Patient had chest pain with ST
Depression in I, II, aVF, V3-6. Resolved with SL Nitroglycerin.
Lipitor 80mg, Lopressor 25mg PO TID restarted. After discussion
with Cardiology & Geriatrics (Primary) 325mg ASA started.
Intermediate Hct drawn after 1.5 Units PRBC administered showing
21.2. At this point the unit was consulted. No blood per rectum,
no hemtatemesis. Patient has no new complaints at this time.
During his ICU admission, the patient received 5 units pRBCs.
Initially, he did not have an appropriate HCT bump, but then he
began to bump appropriately and was hemodynamically stable for
transfer to
