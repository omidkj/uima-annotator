Chief Complaint:
N/V/Malaise/Diarrhea

Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 6759**] is a 66  y/o F with a hx NSCLC s/p lobectomy,
laryngeal ca s/p chemo/XRT with hx failure to thrive [**1-23**]
radiotherapy and with 2 days N/V/D, poor PO.  Daughter-in-law
called oncologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10351**]) with report that patient is
unwell. Starting yesterday developed nausea and diarrhea.
Malaise has persisted today with additional episodes of diarrhea
after any attempt at eating. Daughter in law reports she is very
weak and appears unwell and worried she is dehydrated.
Temperature is 100.3 and blood sugar elevated after pedialyte.
Advised ED evaluation.

 In ED, initial vs were: T 99.0 HR:135 BP:87/68 RR:22 O2Sat:97.
She triggered on arrival because tachycardic to 130s, BP
systolic 80s. EKG consistent with either flutter or MAT. Has h/o
atrial tachyarrhythmias (Followed by [**Doctor Last Name **]) but usually
well-controlled with dilt and metoprolol but not
anti-coagulated. Was given IVF bolus of 3L NS but remained
tachycardic in the 130s and then got 10mg IV dilt with BP in 100
range. Mentating well and asymptomatic.  CXR showed possibility
of acute on chronic aspiration, possible early developing
infiltrate and had crackles on exam. Received ceftriaxone and
flagyl for aspiration pneumonia coverage.  Labs revealed
leukocytosis and hyponatremia.  She was admitted to the MICU for
persistent tachycardia and hypotension.

She had no complaints other than a dry mouth and some pain in
her throat that is chronic since undergoing radiation for her
laryngeal cancer.

Past Medical History:
- Pancoast RUL lung SCC s/p excision, chemotherapy and
radiation. (1st surgery [**6-24**], seconded after XRT [**2171-10-18**])

Studies:

[**2176-4-19**] CXR: Increased reticular nodular interstitial opacities
of the right lung base. Given history, the possibility of
chronic or possibly acute on chronic aspiration is considered.
An early developing infiltrate, otherwise,  may also account for
this appearance. Correlate clinically.

[**2176-4-19**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
and one ventricular premature beat. Diffuse T wave changes.
Since the previous tracing of [**2176-3-6**] the ventricular response
is markedly increased.

[**2176-4-20**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats.
Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2176-4-19**] sinus tachycardia with atrial
premature beats has replaced atrial fibrillation.

[**2176-4-22**] CXR: 1. Persistent but decreased large right pleural
effusion with compressive
atelectasis. Concurrent infection cannot be excluded. Small left
pleural effusion.
2. Increased pulmonary vascular congestion since one day prior.
3. Stable right lung and chest wall postoperative changes.

[**2176-4-24**] Pleural Fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 yo F with h/o squamous cell lung CA s/p induction
chemotherapy, radiation and surgical resection [RUL lobectomy]
as well as COPD who presents to ED with N/V/D/poor PO intake
noted to be hypotensive with diarrhea.

#, Hypotension: Her hypotension was thought to be due to
hypovolemia from dehydration and recent diarrhea in conjunction
with her continuing to take both her diltiazem and metoprolol at
home.  [**Month (only) 116**] also have been related to underlying infection given
concern for a new infiltrate on CXR and h/o chronic aspiration
so vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl were started to cover broadly
for HCAP and aspiration.  Her tachycardia, thought to be MAT or
AFlutter, was postulated to be contributing to the low BPs as
well so a diltiazem gtt was started with moderate decrease in HR
but minimal improvement in BP.  The pt was gently resuscitated
with IVF boluses in the ICU and maintained sbp's in the high 90s
to low 100s consistently which trended up into the low 110s on
transfer to the floor.   After transfer to the floor her BP
remained in normal range.

#. Tachycardia: She has a known history of either MAT or atrial
flutter managed on metoprolol and diltiazem.  The tachycardia
improved with IVFs and diltiazem gtt.  Gtt was weaned off as pt
was started on metoprolol and diltiazem po, both increased to
more than home dosing.  HR in the 80s on transfer to the floor
and remained in normal range.

#. Hypoxia: She had a small O2 requirement on arrival from the
ED, likely [**1-23**] pneumonia on top of malignancy and COPD.  The
patient was started on antibiotics as well as solumedrol 60 mg
q8h and started intermittent BiPAP on ICU day 2.  The pt
tolerated BiPAP well, particularly at night, and was weaned off
as her respiratory status improved.  She was discharged without
oxygen.  She was given a quick 5 day burst of prednisone after
transfer from the ICU.

#. Pnuemonia: She completed an 8 day course of levofloxacin for
CAP, although was initially given broader spectrum antibiotics
for possible HCAP.  She remained afebrile and her respiratory
status rapidly improved.

#. N/V/D: Pt noted to have profuse diarrhea prior to arrival in
the ICU however stool output was very modest while keeping pt
NPO.  C.diff toxin and stool cultures were checked and were
neg
