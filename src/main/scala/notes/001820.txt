History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 12101**] is an 84 year old lady 6 weeks post CABG recently
discharged home from Rehab returns to the ED with weakness, poor
PO intake and R flank pain.

[**10-9**] echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild concentric hypertrophy with small left
ventricular cavity size and hyperdynamic function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-8-23**],
pulmonary artery pressures are lower. The left ventricle is
frankly hyperdynamic and cavity size is smaller.

[**10-9**] lung scan: Match chest X-ray, perfusion, and ventilation
in the right lower lobe, triple match, has an indeterminate
likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism.

[**10-9**] CT head without contrast: No acute intracranial hemorrhage
or mass effect or obvious major acute infarct.

[**10-9**] CXR: Right lower lobe pneumonia.

[**10-9**] renal u/s:
1. Limited study due to portable technique. No hydronephrosis or
renal
calculi seen.
2. 1-cm simple left renal cyst.

[**10-9**] BLE u/s: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
bilateral lower
extremity veins.

Brief Hospital Course:
84yoF s/p recent CABG admit to MICU with hypotension and
radiographic evidence of pneumonia

1. Hypotension: Poor PO intake and hypovolemia VS sepsis from
PNA (elevated WBC's and CXR findings). There was some concern
for PE but pt had negative LENI, V/Q scan  which was
indeterminate, echo with normal RV, and pt thought to be low
pre-test likelihood for PE. Echo with normal RV, hyperdynamic
EF, but elevated LV filling pressure.

Pt was fluid resuscitated. Got Levaquin in ED and started on
Vanc/Cefepime on MICU admission (Vanc 1g x1 dose on [**10-9**], Vanc
dosing by level due to ARF, and Cefepime started [**10-9**] = day 1),
with plan to start Cipro on the am of [**2153-10-11**] = day 1. Vanc
trough will need to be followed up and Vanc dosed accordingly.
Flu was ruled out with negative DFA. Home antihypertensives
(Metoprolol, Lisinopril, Lasix, Amiodarone) were held. Art line
was placed. By time of call out, pt's bp was in low 100's -
120's and pt was asymptomatic. BP was 156/70 on the floor. The
patient was restarted on home dose of Lisinopril. She can be
restarted on Metoprolol and Lasix prn as an outpatient.

2. HCAP vs HAP: Pt with radiographic evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP
versus HCAP given history with associated right sided pleuritic
pain. She denies cough or fever.
Started on Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro as above. Will need to continue
IV Abx for 14 day course, ending on [**2153-10-23**]. The patient had a
PICC placed for long-term Abx.

3. Delirium with tremulousness: Pt with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status in 24 hrs leading up to admission per family report. Also
with new tremor, DDx including new Compazine medication vs
Neurontin overdose in setting of worsening renal fxn [**12-25**] to
hypovolemia from poor PO intake. Compazine was held on
admission. Toxicology was consulted and recommended holding
Neurontin. Infxn was treated as above. Mental status was back to
baseline while the patient was on the medical floor. Compazine
and Neurontin are still being held, but can be restarted as an
outpatient with close monitoring of Cr.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's Cr was elevated
to 2.8 on admission with a baseline of 1.1-1.2, still elevated
based on her size, weight and age. Pre-renal from poor PO intake
vs ATN from hypoTN. FeUrea was 0.02% consistent with pre-renal
etiology.  Pt was fluid resuscitated and Cr trended down to 1.7,
closer to her baseline by time of call out from MICU. Held home
Lisinopril and Lasix while in the MICU. The patient's Cr
improved to 0.9, and she was restarted on Lisinopril prior to
discharge.

5. Anemia: Pt was at pre-operative baseline, but worriesome for
hemoconcentration. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or
hemolysis given normal LFTs, but thro
