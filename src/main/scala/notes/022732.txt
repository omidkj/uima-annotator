Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14964**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CABGx6
Cardiac Catheterization with IntrAortic Balloon pump


History of Present Illness:
45yo non-smoking Male with family history of CAD who present to
OSH with progressive sob over one month.  He reports antecedent
"flu" like symptoms including congestion, headache,
non-productive cough.  The symptoms resolved after two weeks at
which point he noticed dyspnea on exertion and continued
non-productive cough.  Symptoms are exacerbated at night when he
lies down and relieved by sitting up.  Pt admits to PND but
denies orthopnea - stable 1 pillow.  Pt denies chest pain, but
admits to some reproducible chest discomfort.  He also denies le
swelling (thought he was just getting flabby).  Although the
patient is not very active, he reports he could walk many miles
and walk up 1 flight of stairs (and maybe two flights with some
strain) without difficulty 6 months ago.  Now though he admits
he can not walk up a flight of stairs without shortness of
breath.
   The patient presented to Metowest ED with a BP of 194/138
with pulse 110 and 2+ piting edema.  ECG was read as NSR with
LVH and non-specific anterior T and ST abnormalities.  CXR
showed curly B-lines with redistribution consistent with CHF.
BNP was 1690, CK 74, troponin 0.05.  He was given 40mg IV lasix
x1, 1 inch nitro past without change in his BP.  Cardiology on
call recommended IV hydralazine, however this was never given as
they had difficulty obtaining hydralazine from the pharmacy at
the time.  He was subsequently started on nitro gtt and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
   At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient received ASA x1, SL NTG and metoprolol
5mg IV x1.  He was then started back on the nitro gtt and
admitted to the CCU.

Past Medical History:
None (Has not seen a doctor since the 80s)

Social History:
Pt is a retired former desk worker.  He has worked at med
records at [**Hospital1 **], desk clert at motel 6, etc in past.  He
admits to occasional drug use but denies smoking, illicit drug
use.

Family History:
Father: 1st MI at 55, CA
Mother: [**Name (NI) 11964**]
Pt is the youngest of 9 children.
Brother: CABG at age 50
Brother: CVA ?age
Brother: gall bladder, pancreatitis

possible vascular redistribution.

[**2101-2-17**] ETT-MIBI:
"INTERPRETATION: 45 yo man was referred to evaluate his
shortness of
breath. The patient completed 3 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol
representing
a very poor functional exercise tolerance. The exercise test was
stopped
secondary to early-onset, progressive and marked shortness of
breath at
peak exercise. In the setting of the marked shortness of breath,
a drop
in systolic blood pressure was noted from baseline; 140/90 to
120/88
(taken twice). No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were
reported
during the procedure. No lightheadedness of pre-syncopal
symptoms were
reported. In the presence of baseline LVH, the ECG is
uninterpretable.
The rhythm was sinus with no ectopy noted. As noted, an
asymptomatic
hypotensive response to exercise was noted.

IMPRESSION: Poor functional exercise tolerance limited by marked

dyspnea disproportionate to the level of exercise. Asymptomatic
hypotensive blood pressure response to exercise. No typical
anginal
symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG. Nuclear report sent
separatately."
.
.
"HISTORY: the new diagnosis of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia
and new onset congestive heart failure.

SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
Exercise protocol: [**Doctor First Name **]
Resting heart rate: 61
Resting blood pressure: 140/98
Exercise duration: 3 minutes
Peak heart rate: 92
Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained: 53%
Blood pressure at peak exercise: 120/88
Symptoms during exercise: progressive early onset shortness of
breath
Reason exercise terminated: progressive shortness of breath and
drop in systolic blood pressure
ECG findings: uninterpretable

INTERPRETATION:
Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tl-201.
Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting
images. Exercise
images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.

The image quality is good.

Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged with a calculated
volume at end
diastole of 244 cc.

Gated images reveal severe global hypokinesis.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 27%.

There are no fixed or reversible perfusion defects.

IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion at the level of exercise
achieved with left ventricular dilatation, global hypokinesis,
and calculated ejection fraction of 27%."

"INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Positive stress test, ongoing chest pain.

PROCEDURE:
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
