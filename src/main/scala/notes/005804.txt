HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old
woman with a lifelong history of obesity and a current body
weight of 343 pounds, height of 5 feet 3 inches, and a body
mass index of 61.  She has tried numerous weight loss
programs in the past without significant  long-term success.
These efforts included diet workshop in [**2179**] with a 30-pound
weight loss, 6 months of diet workshop in [**2182**] achieving 50-
pound loss, but she has been unable to maintain her weight
loss in the long run.  Her highest adult weight was
approximately 360 pounds.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension diagnosed in [**2164**].

History of obstructive sleep apnea, requiring CPAP since
[**2193**].

Hypothyroidism diagnosed in [**2195**].

History of dyslipidemia in [**2197**].

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Chronic back pain since [**2192**].

History of gallstone disease, requiring laparoscopic
cholecystectomy in [**2195**].

She was also admitted to the local hospital due to
respiratory failure and was noted to have pneumonia requiring
10 days of hospitalization.  She was noted at that time to
have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which was
evaluated with pulmonary function test.  She was also noted
to have asthma.  She required a high-dose of steroid therapy
for her respiratory problems in [**3-29**] at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in [**2195**].

Several orthopedic procedures involving the bilateral knees.

Status post a bladder suspension surgery for urinary
incontinence.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Toprol 100 mg q.d.
2. Accupril 40 mg q.d.
3. Synthroid 0.1 mg q.d.
4. Prilosec 20 mg q.d.
5. Guaifenex 600/60 mg b.i.d.
6. Evista 60 mg q.d.
7. Darvocet 650 mg p.r.n.
8. Neurontin 200 mg t.i.d.
9. Flurbiprofen 100 mg b.i.d.
10.      Multivitamins and occasional ampicillin for dental
   prophylaxis.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies use of tobacco, recreational drugs,
or alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for stroke, peripheral vascular
disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and
obesity.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for atypical chest pain with
a negative cardiac workup, suspicion of cardiac arrhythmia
but with a negative Holter study, bilateral ankle edema,
shortness of breath upon exertion, occasional diarrhea,
history of kidney stones, and a history of neuropathy.  Rest
of her review of systems is within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a middle-aged woman, morbidly
obese.  She is in mild respiratory difficulty after exertion.
Her blood pressure is 148/82 with a heart rate of 72.  Her
skin is clear with occasional keratosis.  Sclerae are
anicteric.  Her oropharynx is clear without lesions.  The
neck examination shows no obvious adenopathy or cardiac
bruits.  Due to her short neck, the examination is quite
difficult.  Her chest examination shows occasional wheezes in
bilateral lung fields.  Cardiac examination shows regular
rate and rhythm without murmurs.  The abdomen is extremely
obese with 2 plus visceral obesity, and is nondistended and
nontender.  There are no palpable hernias.  Bilateral
extremities show no edema.  Neurologically, there are no
deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent labs, EKG from [**12-28**] reveals
normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 66 with a borderline first-
degree AV block.  ST segment does not reveal obvious ischemic
changes.  Fasting laboratory data, hemoglobin A1c is 6.2
suggestive of possible early glucose intolerance.  The rest
of her laboratory tests including CBC, coagulation studies,
electrolytes, chemistries, LFTs, and serum lipid profiles are
all within normal limits.  Chest x-ray from [**3-29**] was within
normal limits.  The pulmonary function tests during her
[**Hospital1 1562**] hospitalization reveal an FEV1 of 64 percent with an
FEV1/FVC ratio of 80, and reduced diffusion capacity of 48
percent consistent with obstructive and restrictive airway
disease.  There is some concern about some possible emphysema
and interstitial lung disease.  CT scan from [**3-29**], negative
for pulmonary emboli or abnormal masses.  Duplex ultrasound
of the lower extremities, negative for deep venous
thrombosis.  Cardiac echocardiogram at that time showed a
moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, but a normal systolic
function with an ejection fraction of approximately 70
percent.  Nuclear imaging study, negative for ischemia, and
overall ejection fraction was noted to be approximately 69
percent.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Purple Surgery Service on [**2198-8-17**] and underwent a
laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.  Due to her
underlying lung pathology, the decision was made to keep the
patient intubated after surgery and extubate her later in the
ICU.  The surgery was without complications.  Please see the
operative note for further details.  On postoperative day
one, the patient was in the ICU, intubated, but stable.  Her
propofol was weaned, and she was extubated on that morning.
After extubation, a methylene blue test was performed, which
was negative.  She then went for an upper GI study, which was
negative for leaks.  The patient was transferred to the
floor, and started on a stage I diet.  On postoperative day
two, the patient started stage II diet and oral pain
medicine, which she tolerated.  She was then transitioned to
a stage III diet later in the day, which she tolerated
without difficulty.  On postoperative day three, the patient
was tolerating her oral stage III diet and p.o. pain
medications as well as her pre-hospitalization medications.
The decision was made to discharge her to home.  She will
follow up in the [**Hospital 1560**] Clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in three
weeks.
