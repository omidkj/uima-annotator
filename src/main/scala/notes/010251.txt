(systolic and diastolic, last EF 40% 2/10), Parkinsons disease,
DM2, HTN, Renal cell carcinoma (s/p L nephrectomy), and TIA who
presents with delirium, concern for UTI. He has a history of
enterococcal UTI and MRSA UTI.  Per wife, after [**Name (NI) **], he

The previously seen right PICC has been removed. There are low
lung volumes.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are seen,
with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation not
excluded. The cardiac silhouette can not be adequately assessed
due to adjacent effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old man with a history of Parkinson's Disease, CAD,
ischemic cardiomyophathy with an EF of 40%, DM2, RCC s/p left
partial nephrectomy, and prostate CA s/p radiation admitted to
the ICU with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory distress and
AMS. Previously admitted with delirium with concern for UTI.
Required BiPAP in the ICU given hypercarbia. UCx grew yeast with
positive UA briefly treated with ceftriaxone and we did not
treat for this. Transferred to floor from ICU on [**2186-2-4**].
.
# Hypercarbic resp. distress: This resolved. Likely due to CHF
exacerbation in setting of poor reserve and large L pleural
effusion and kyphosis.  Impoved with NPPV, VBG 7.53/40/40 did
not require NPPV on [**2-4**]. This was monitored and he did not
necessitate NIV. We optimised his CHF management and diuresed
with IV furosemide to goal of -1L to 500cc on [**2-4**]. Subseqently
he developed hypernatremia and was felt to be dehydrated.
Further diuresis was held until [**2186-2-7**], when his home
Spironolactone was re-started. He was on room air for >48 hours
prior to discharge.
.
# Delirium: Likely multifactorial with a large contribution from
hypercarbia and hypoxemia.  His UCx were negative (of note he
had previous VRE senstitive to ampicillin on past culture data)
and he had two UCx which grew yeast. On previous admissions he
had been treated wuth courses of fluconazole for yeast UTI but
we felt this was not indicated at this time. Given poor swallow
and aspiration on speech and swallow review on [**1-31**] it was felt
likely that he had been sub-clinically aspirating. We coninued
lorazepam (per home regimen/per pt's wife) prn
anxiety/agitation. He required frequent reorientation.
.
# Pyuria. This was felt likely [**3-1**] fungal infection. Urine
cultures were negative but grew yeast. We elected not to treat
with fluconazole. Final urine culture is pending at the time of
discharge.
.
# Hypernatremia. Likely secondary to aggressive diuresis. He was
encouraged to take further po and his Na improved with free
water. His diet should be liberalized to thin liquids when
observed so as to prevent further dehydration and for his own
comfort and enjoyment. Patient and wife understand this will
place him at greater risk for aspiration.
.
#Parkinson's disease:  Given poor swallow, he was unable to take
his oral PD medications and was treated with S/L Parcopa. There
was no evidence of significant rigidity or cogwheeling and
bradykinesia seemed better by [**2-4**]. We continued Parcopa and the
dose was uptitrated on [**2-4**] to four times daily.
.
# Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: HF EF 40%. We
continued home metoprolol and [**Last Name (un) **] alon
