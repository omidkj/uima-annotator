Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24110**] is an 85 yo M w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG who presents w/ 1
day h/o CP. Noontime on day PTA pt. noted sudden onset of [**4-3**]
midsternal, dull CP & SOB while seated and watching TV. CP
resolved on own over next few hours and pt. was able to perform
daily activities w/o additional pain/symptoms. The following
day, pt. awoke w/ [**8-3**] worsening, midsternal, dull CP and waited
approx. 30 min. before calling lifeline for assistance. He
denies diaphoresis, palpitations, dizziness, n/v, abd pain.
.
At OSH pt. was found to have ecg notable for elevations in V2-V4
and positive tropinin values of 1.2 and 0.39. Pt. was started on
heparin gtt, ASA, nitro, morphin, lopressor 2.5mg x 4 , & plavix
150mg with resolution of chest pain. PTT 150, and heparin gtt
was stopped.
.
Pt. was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for cardiac catheterization,
where found to be T: 98.2 HR:75 BP: 136/75 RR 18 & 100% 2L nc.
Evaluation revealed tropinin elevated to 1.27 although ecg was
no longer notable for ST elevations.

Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2166-2-15**] demonstrated:
90% prox and mid LAD lesions s/p BMS x 3 and 80% D1 s/p POBA
RHC: RA mean 8, RV 64/5, PA 64/36, PCW 23. CO 4.06, CI 2.07 (on
IABP and dopamine gtt)
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2166-2-14**] demonstrated:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was without
angiographically evident flow limiting stenosis.  The LAD had a
90% proximal lesion, 90% mid lesion, diffuse distal disease, and
an 80% diagonal lesion.  The LCx had 70% stenosis. RCA w/ 50%
proximal stenosis and 80% stenosis R-PL.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal aortic systolic

pressure of 116 mm Hg.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
.
Echo [**2166-2-15**]:
The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal/anterior
hypokinesis/akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (area
1.1-1.2 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST [**2166-2-24**]:
1.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusion with right lower lobe
opacification
and air bronchograms probably related to patient's recent
history of
aspiration pneumonia.  Bilateral linear opacities abutting both
major fissures
likely reflect atelectasis.
2.  Focal ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe and LLL
6 mm nodule just inferior to the left major fissure. No
comparisons are available to assess stability - these is
nonspecific and may be infectious vs inflammatory. In the
absence of comparison studies to establish longitudinal
stability, followup chest CT of pulmonary nodule is recommended
in 12 months (assuming no risk factors for primary lung
malignancy).
3. Hyperdense exophytic focus arising from the left kidney. This
may represent a hyperdense cyst - renal ultrasound or MRI
suggested for further assessment of solid vs cystic character.
4. No evidence of abscess or pancreatitis, within the limits of
a CT
examination.
.
Video swallow [**2166-3-3**]:
Moderate-to-severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration noted
of barium of all consistencies.
.
MRI head [**2166-3-5**]:
No acute intracranial pathology including no hemorrhage or
infarction.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2166-3-10**] demonstrated:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had moderate diffuse
disease
without critical lesions.  The LAD had a prior stent which was
occluded
proximally with thrombus noted.  The LCx was a non-dominant
vessel with
70% noted in stent restenosis.  The RCA was a dominant vessel
and was
not injected.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling
pressures
with LVEDP 10 mmHg.  The pulmonary artery systolic blood
pressure is
mildly elevated at 31 mmHg.  The cardiac index is elevated at
5.42
L/min/m2.  There is evidence  of systemic arterial systolic and
diastolic hypotension with SBP 91 mmHg and DBP 52 mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA, thrombectomy and stenting of the mid LAD
with a 2.75
x 18 mm VISION BMS which was post dilated to 2.75 at high
pressure.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent, no
dissection and TIMI II flow (See PTCA comments)
4. Successful PTCA of the diagonal with a 2.0 x 15 mm voyager
balloon.
Final angiography revealed a 20% residual stenosis in the
diagonal, no
dissection and TIMI II flow. (See PTCA comments)
5. Successful IABP placement in Right groin.
.
Echo [**2166-3-11**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anteroseptum and
anterior walls. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-2-25**], the
left ventricular function is slightly worse. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension is now present

CXR [**2166-3-18**]: In comparison with the study of [**3-16**], the patient
has taken a somewhat better inspiration. There is persistent
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, though the pulmonary
vascularity is essentially within normal limits. The blunting of
the costophrenic angles has decreased and the hemidiaphragms are
more sharply seen.
