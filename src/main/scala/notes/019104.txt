History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness (on admission per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 16189**]:

This 59-year old woman with history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, morbid obesity last well at either 8pm
or 10pm last night presents with possible paraphasic errors and
abdominal pain as transfer from [**Hospital6 302**].  Patient
was
reportedly hospitalized for much of [**Month (only) 404**] and [**Month (only) 956**] with
cellulitis after a fall.  Apparently during that time she had
intermittent cognitive errors, for example thinking she was at
Papa [**Male First Name (un) 45193**] when she was at the hospital.  She did not seem to
have a specific language impairment.  Since she has been at home
husband thinks she's been cognitively normal.  Last night around
[**7-26**] pm the patient's daughter saw her appear normal, and the
patient went to bed.  At 1am the husband heard her yelling.  He
went upstairs to find her sitting on the side of her bed,
possibly having vomiting.  She appeared to be in substantial
pain
clutching her abdomen and saying "my stomach is not stomaching."

He recalled that she may have made some other unusual word
choices but cannot recall them.  Her speech was slightly more
difficult to understand than usual.  There was no focal weakness
or facial droop appreciated.  Her face appeared "drawn" though.
She tried to stand up but had to sit back down due to pain, and
apparently kept just repeating herself saying "my stomach is
stomaching."  She may also have complained of a headache.  EMS
arrived and per their report she was making "dysphasic errors"
and complained of a headache.  She was brought to [**Hospital6 48708**] where she had initial vitals T 97.9, BP 173/76, HR 73,
RR 20, exam showed "expressive aphasic," and she was seen to
have
possible small left temporo-occipital infarct on head CT of
undetermined age, and then she was intubated for concerns that
she was not able to protect her airway while with
nausea/vomiting.  Otherwise she had no signs of illness prior to
her event in the middle of the night.  She was not having
fevers,
belly pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.  She was not complaining of
chest pain or shortness of breath.  She did not have any
weaknes,
numbness, discoordination, speech, or language problems prior to
night of presentation.

Past Medical History:
Morbid obesity
Diabetes
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
Depression
Diverticulosis
Left leg cellulitis - treated with inpatient hospitalization
antibiotics/rehab [**Month (only) **]/[**Month (only) **]
Tracheostomy - placed 2 years ago for complicated hospital
acuired pneumonia
Confusion during hospitalizations recently though not when at
home, for example thinking she is at Papa [**Male First Name (un) 45193**] restaurant and
similar statements while in hospital
cesarian section x2
Pulmonary HTN requiring 3-4 liters of oxygen


Social History:
Lives with husband and daughter; daughter is disabled,
23-years old disability related to stroke on DOL 1; per husband
baseline function is that she sits in a wheelchair, eats her
meals and can do some light cooking; she can no longer go up and
down stairs and is on home oxygen


Family History:
Daughter had a perinatal stroke; mother deceased in her 80s
from esophageal cancer, father deceased in his 80s from kidney
failure, had hypercholesterolemia but not obesity and had MIs in
50s.

Neuro
MS: not following commands, does move extremities when touched
relatively gently
CN: [**Name (NI) 2994**] 3 mm to 2 mm brisk, unable to position adequately for
fundoscopic exam, some lateral movement to eyes, corneals
positive but perhaps slightly brisker on left, minimal grimace
able to be elicited but face appears relatively symmetric at
rest
though is taped, not gagging when tube is suctioned

extremities, seems slightly more sensitive to touch in LLE than
other three extremities
Sensory: no clear grimace but withdraws all extremities to
noxious stimulation, LLE slightly more briskly
Reflexes: unable to elicit patellar or achilles, brachioradialli
are 2+ bilaterally, unable to elicit biceps, triceps, toes are
clearly down bilaterally

Exam on discharge:
O: Vitals Tm. 98.2 Tc. 97.5 BP. 132-154/72-80 HR. 70s RR 20 94%
3LNC

air
Abdomen: Protuberant, +BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended
Ext: Erythematous, edematous, warm, well perfused, 2+ DP pulses
b/l, no clubbing/cyanosis. 1+ pitting edema b/l.
Skin:  Diffuse morbilliform erythema of whole-body with
significant peeling skin/excoriation of skin of LE bilaterally.
Improving with large clear patches.

Pertinent Results:
[**2124-2-13**]: MRI
IMPRESSION:
Subacute infarct in the left posterior parietal lobe on a
background of
moderate microangiopathic small vessel disease. Other
possibilities include
focal cerebritis and vasculitis.

[**2124-2-15**]: Echo
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler or bubble study x 3. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. There is mild functional mitral stenosis
(mean gradient 8 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: no intracardiac shunt (but suboptimal study);
hypertrophic, hyperdynamic, stiff left ventricle with mild
mitral stenosis and significant diastolic filling impairment,
severe pulmonary hypertension, moderate tricuspid regurgitation
