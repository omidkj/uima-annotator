Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
THis is a 69yo M with h/o CAD, DM2 and HTN who presented to the
ED with chest pain. He woke up at 4am on the day of admission
with left sided sharp 10/10 chest pain that radiates down his
left arm. He took nitro with minimal relief.On route to [**Hospital1 18**] on
the ambulance, he recieved multiple [**Last Name (un) 4070**] spray which brought
the pain down. He complained of nausea but denies
SOB/palpitation/dizziness.
On arrival to ED, his SBP is 180 with HR 90. He recieved ASA,
lopressor, morphine, nitro gtt, integrillin and plavix.
Concerning with in stent thrombosis

Past Medical History:
1. coronary artery disease-CABG [**2113**]; stent in native OM [**2117-2-10**]
2. NIDDM with neuropathy
3. hypertension


Social History:
He lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 620**]. Rare
alcohol use and denies any cigarette smoking. He is a
retired consultant (pharmacist).

Pertinent Results:
PROCEDURE DATE: [**2117-2-10**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Angina
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Multi-vessel native coronary disease.
2. Atretic LIMA-LAD
3. Patent SVG-OM and Radial graft to RI
4. Successful stenting of native OM with 2.0 x 18mm Pixel stent.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed multi-vessel coronary disease. The LMCA was without
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had a mild, 30% ISRS
but was
otherwise without flow-limiting disease. A D1 branch had a mild
40%
lesion. The LCX had a tight, 99% origin lesion, but the distal
and AV
groove vessel filled well. The RCA had a 50% ostial lesion but
was
otherwise without flow limiting disease.
2. Graft angiography revealed an atretic LIMA-LAD. The SVG-OM
had
patent stents but a 90% lesion just beyond the most distal stent
in a
small native OM vessel. The Radial graft was without flow
limiting
disease.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a mildly elevated
central
aortic pressure 148/71.
4. Successful placement of 2.0 x 18 mm Pixel stent in the native
OM
distal to the SVG-OM bypass graft with significant effort. Final
angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection, and normal flow

PROCEDURE DATE: [**2117-2-15**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Known CAD, prior CABG, recent PCI, rest pain with concern for
stent
thrombosis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely diseased SVG-OM bypass graft.
3. Central hypertension.
4. Unsuccessful treatment of SVG-OM bypass graft disease.
5. Unsuccessful treatment of chronically, totally occluded OM.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated
native three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
flow-limiting coronary disease. The LAD had a 40% in-stent
restenosis
(ISR) of a previously placed midvessel stent without other
significant
flow-limiting disease. The LCx was subtotally occluded
proimximally with
a totally occluded OM1. The ramus intermedius was totally
occluded
ostially.
2. Graft angigoraphy demonstrated a SVG-OM with thrombotic
occlusion
as well as TIMI 1 flow. The previously stented distal native
vessel
after the touchdown of this graft did not fill. The SVG-RI was
without
flow-limiting disease. The LIMA was not selectively engaged as
shown to
be atretic at the last catheterization.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed central hypertension
with
blood pressure 177/83 mmHg.
4. Unsuccessful treatment of thrombotic SVG-OM with TIMI 1 flow
despite attempts to remove the thrombus burden mechanically,
administration of intra-coronary medications, and balloon
angioplasty of
the previously placed distal stents. Final angiography
demonstrated
continued thrombus burden, no angiographically apparent
dissection, and
slow flow (See PTCA Comments).
5. Unsuccessful treatment of native chronically, totally
occluded OM
due to inability to cross despite aggressive guide position and
aggressive wire choices.

Brief Hospital Course:
69yo M with severe CAD, HTN, hypercholesterlemia presented with
OM thrombosis and SVG-OM thrombosis unintervenable. He
underwent cardiac catheterization in [**2117-2-10**] which shows:
graft: patent SVG-OM, patent radial-R1, atretic LIMA-LAD
native:LMCA OK, LAD 30%ISR, D1 40%, LCx 99% origin, RCA 50%, OM
90% after graft touchdown
On  admission [**2-15**] cath shows:
graft:thrombotic occlusion with TIMI 1 flow in SVG-OM not
intervenable; TO stented native OM not intervenable
native: 40% ISR with no flow limit
Multiple attempt was unsuccesful in opening graft to OM or
native OM. Patient was allowed to infarct and was supported with
morphine. He was continued on plavix lifelong, lipitor and
aspirin. Aggressive BP control was done with restarted
lopressor, imdur and zestril.
