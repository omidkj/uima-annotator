Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Supraventricular Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE

History of Present Illness:
52M with no pmh reporting 12 days of increased abdominal girth
and 5 days of lower extremity swelling, presented to his PCP
today and found to have a supraventricular tachycardia to 140 on
ekg. He reports having a cough with yellow sputum which occurred
shortly before he noticed his increased abdominal size. he
denied ever feeling palpitations or chest pain, but did report
shortness of breath with the cough.  he took robitussin and his
shortness of breath and cough resolved. Upon presentation to his
PCP and discovery of his supraventricular tachycardia, he was
brought to [**Hospital3 4107**] where he was given diltiazem 45mg IV
and metoprolol 7.5mg without effect.  Bedside echo at the time
showed LVH with an ejection fraction of 10%.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where vitals were 99.5 145 165/98
20 97%RA.  He was given lopressor 5mg IV X1 without effect,
followed by adenosine 12mg which broke his rhythm and showed
atrial flutter with 4:1 block.  His rate returned to 145.  He
was placed on a nitro drip and given aspirin 325mg X1.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

[**2104-9-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with mild volume
overload. More confluent opacity in the lung bases may be due to
soft tissue attenuation, atelectasis, and/or focal pneumonia.
Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to
assess for underlying infection. If clinically feasible,
consider PA and lateral views in the Radiology Suite for a more
sensitive evaluation. Cardiomegaly is also noted.

[**2104-9-10**] EKG: Atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 139. Left
axis deviation. Marked J point elevation with early
repolarization in anterior precordial leads. Diffuse
non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities elsewhere. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2104-9-11**] TEE ECHO: The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). A probable thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 30 cm from the
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Probable thrombus in left atrial appendage. Severely
depressed [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function.



Brief Hospital Course:
52M with no past medical history presenting with new onset
systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with
alternating 4:1 and 2:1 block.
.
# Atrial Flutter: His atrial flutter may have begun nearly two
weeks ago when he first developed cough and increased abdominal
girth.  He was initially in a 2:1 block with a HR in the
140s-150s and his cardiac enzymes were negative.  His rhythm was
initially resistant to diltiazem drip and metoprolol.  An
electrophysiology consult was obtained and the plan was to
proceed with TEE to rule out atrial clot prior to ablation of
the circuit.  A TEE was performed which showed probable thrombus
in the left atrial appendage and the ablation was therefore
cancelled.  He was then started on Metoprolol 75mg QID and
verpamil 60mg [**Hospital1 **] which managed to push his rhythm into 4:1
block with a HR in the 80s to 100s.  He was also digoxin loaded,
but the digoxin was discontinued because he had 2 prolonged
pauses in his rhythm with the vagal stimulation of passing gas
and it was felt that digoxin was making this more pronounced.
For his left atrial appendage clot he was started on heparin IV
as a bridge to Coumadin.  He will continue the bridging at home
with Lovenox and will have his INR measured on [**9-15**].  He
will follow-up with electrophysiology in 1 month as an
outpatient for repeat TEE and possible ablation if there is no
clot seen.  Until then he will remain of metoprolol 150mg [**Hospital1 **]
and verpamil 60mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control.
.
# Acute Systolic Congestive heart failure:  He appears to have
predominantly right sided heart failure with absence of
crackles, along with presence of JVP, abdominal edema, and
increased abdominal girth.  Echo showed EF=15-20%. BNP elevated
to 7000. Etiologies may include cardiomyopathy induced by
alcohol, viral infection from previous upper respiratory
infection, or tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy.  He diuresed
well with Lasix 20mg IV.
.
# Hypertension: He was started on metoprolol and lisinopril.
.
# Coronary artery disease prevention: Will start on aspirin
81mg. Consider checking lipid profile with PCP as an outpatient.

CODE: Code status was confirmed as full.
