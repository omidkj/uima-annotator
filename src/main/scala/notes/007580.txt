Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital 47**] hospital for balloon pericardiotomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
balloon pericardiotomy

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75 yo woman with PMH of Lung cancer
(adenocarcinoma) diagnosed in [**2176**], on maintenance XRT and
chemotherapy, history of HTN, diastolic dysfunction, and CRI who
presents from [**Hospital 47**] hospital with newly noted pericardial
effusion for balloon pericardiotomy. Patient states that she was
feeling in her USOH until 2 weeks prior to presentation at
[**Hospital 47**] hospital, when began feeling sick with cough,
described as dry cough productive of only scant amounts of
yellow sputum. Per patient, has cough at baseline productive of
white, foamy sputum, from her lung ca, but this cough was
different. Over the next 2 weeks, her cough progressed, was
associated with fever to around 100 on-and-off, SOB with
exertion, and on day of presentation to [**Location (un) 47**], had episode
of nausea and vomiting. 2 days PTA, she started on doxycycline
prescribed by her outpatient physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improvement and
in fact worsening of her symptoms. She denies any orthopnea,
PND, LE swelling, change in weight, palpitations,
lightheadedness/dizziness, change in bowel habits, urinary
symptoms during this time.
.
On presentation to the OSH on [**2180-2-12**], patient was found to be
hypoxic, requiring oxygen through nasal cannula. During
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course at [**Location (un) 47**], she had an admission
CXR demonstrating large RUL and RML consolidation, mass like
lesion in R hilum c/w pneumonia, ?post-obstructive, ?recurrent
ca. Patient was treated with azithromycin and clindamycin.
Patient also had ECHO done in the ED that demonstrated small
pericardial effusion of 1.1 cm, no evidence of tamponade. Follow
up ECHO 5 days after admission demonstrated increase of her
pericardial effusion, still no evidence of tamponade, and
therefore patient was transferred for balloon pericardiotomy.
Hospital course otherwise notable for transfusion of 2 units
pRBC that brought her Hct from 26-> 30.2. Patient was also noted
at one point to be hypoglycemic with FSBS=36 for unknown reasons
- resolved with D50, and subsequently had normal FSBS. Patient
also had episode of desaturation to 80's, which resolved with
administration of 20mg IV lasix.
.
Currently, post-balloon pericardiotomy, patient feels well.
Denies any chest pain/pressure, shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] other
complaints at this time.

CXR [**2-18**]: IMPRESSION:
Interval development of marked right-sided upper lung volume
loss. At least partial obstruction of the right upper and right
middle lobe bronchi is not excluded.
Airspace opacity, most evident in the left mid and lower lung
zones, with left-sided small pleural effusion. The findings
represent mild pulmonary edema.
Pericardial drain projecting over the cardiac apex.
These findings would all be better assessed with
contrast-enhanced CT examination of the chest.
.
Echo [**2-18**]: Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is a large circumferential pericardial effusion. There
are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
Echo [**2-18**]: Conclusions:
1. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
2.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo woman with PMH of lung cancer, diastolic dysfxn, CRI, who
presented with pericardial effusion for pericaricentesis and
pericardiotomy.
.
# Pericardial effusion:
pt had successful balloon pericardiotomy performed, 300cc
removed during procedure, 300cc additionally via drain, this was
kept in place until output was < 500cc/8hr and removed on [**2-19**],
repeat echo prior to removal showed trace effusion remaining.
The fluid was serosanguinous, labs showed [**Numeric Identifier 102834**] RBCs, 3000
WBCs, 85 polys, 11 lymps, 2 monos, 1 eo, 1 macro.  Cytology
pending at time of discharge, although most likely cause felt to
be malignancy given hx of lung CA.  Pt received 1 dose of Kefzol
after procedure.
.
# Cardiac:
A. Coronaries: Patient without evidence of ischemic heart
disease, last cath per OSH records in [**2176**] w/ clean coronary
arteries, no signs/sxs of ischemic heart disease currently.
.
B. Pump: Patient w/ hx of diastolic heart failure, on lasix 40mg
PO QD as outpt. Currently appears euvolemic. Continued regular
dose lasix and spironolactone.
.
C. Rhythm: patient initially in NSR, on [**2-19**] she developed sinus
tachycardia - ? [**1-13**] infection vs pericardial irritation.  Pt
thereafter was noted to have periods of tachycardia up to 130s
with underlying atrial tachycardial/multifocal atrial
tachycardia.  She was additionally noted to have episodes of
AVNRT with well visualized retrograde p waves.  Her electrolytes
were within normal limits.  Her metoprolol was increased to 67.5
TID, and may need to be titrated further.  Overnight [**2-19**] she
continued having episode of tachycardia to 120s, BP stable,
asymptomatic, resolving spontaneously.
.
# Pneumonia: Per patient, c/o cough and fever on presentation to
OSH. Per OSH records, ? RUL and RML pna on CXR c/w possible
post-obstructive pna. Was treated w/ azithromycin (started [**2-12**])
and clindamycin (started [**2-13**]) at OSH. On presentation,
