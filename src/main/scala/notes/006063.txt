Admission Date:  [**2124-11-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-12-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2054-12-20**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post V fib arrest after elective
cardioversion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old Caucasian
female with known coronary artery disease status post CABG in
[**2119**], ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25%, severe mitral
regurgitation and diabetes.  She was in her usual state of
health until [**2124-10-13**] when she presented to an outside
hospital not feeling well, found to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation.  She was rate controlled on Diltiazem, started
on Coumadin, sent home.  She presented to [**Hospital3 23439**] Hospital
on [**2124-11-24**] for elective cardioversion, having started on
Sotalol 80 mg po bid the a.m. before.  She was cardioverted
times two with return to normal sinus rhythm.  Her procedure
was without complications until patient was found in the bed,
face down, approximately two hours after cardioversion in V
fib arrest.  She was coded and received CPR for 3-4 minutes
and returned in normal sinus rhythm after one shock and 1 mg
Atropine.  At that time she was started on Dopamine 3
mcg/minute and then Dobutamine was added secondary to
hypotension.  These were titrated to 12 and 10 respectively.
She was intubated and ventilated.  She had non sustained V
tach and Lidocaine was started.  At this time she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management and possibly an EP study.  On admission
she was currently intubated, sedated, comfortable appearing.
Upon her arrival her heart rate was in the 130's and Dopamine
was 3.5 and Dobutamine was 2.  Tele revealed an 11 beat run
of non sustained V tach.  Tele revealed an 11 beat and also a
23 beat run of non sustained V tach.  However, mean arterial
pressures remained above 70.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post
CABG times five in [**2119**] with inferolateral deficit which were
unreversible.  She also had a stress test in [**2124**] which
showed fixed inferolateral deficits which were not
reversible.  Severe/moderate MR, ischemic cardiomyopathy with
EF of 25%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus with nephropathy
and retinopathy, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular
disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  At home, Aspirin, Zocor, Lasix, Isosorbide
Dinitrate, Vasotec, Glucotrol, Coumadin and Digoxin.  On
transfer included Dobutamine GGT, Dopamine GGT and Lidocaine
GGT.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives at home.  She denies tobacco or
alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unavailable.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission included CBC with white count
10.8, hematocrit 38.2, platelet count 168,000, INR 3.5, PTT
34.6.  Chem 7 showed sodium of 134, potassium 4.1, chloride
98, CO2 24, BUN 36, creatinine 1.5, sugar 532, calcium 9.4,
albumin 3.4, magnesium 2.0, Digoxin 0.8, CK 121, MB 5.6,
troponin 0.9.  ABG showed the following:  PH 7.43, PCO2 31,
PO2 66.  LFTs showed total bilirubin 1.7, alkaline
phosphatase 221, ALT 29 and AST 59.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission vitals included the
following: Pulse 82 and normal sinus rhythm.  Blood pressure
96/57 with mean arterial pressure 73, satting 98%,
respiratory rate 18.  Assist control 550/16, PEEP 5, FIO2
40%.  Peak pressure was 35, plateau pressure was 12.  In
general this is a Caucasian female in no acute distress,
intubated, sedated.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive
to light.  Neck, centralized right IJ, carotids 2+
bilaterally without bruit, trachea midline.  Chest, coarse
breath sounds bilaterally, no rales or wheezes.  Cardiac,
regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no rubs, murmurs
or gallops.  Abdomen soft, nontender, non distended, positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities, cool legs, dopplerable foot
pulses, warm hands.  Neuro, she is sedated, unresponsive to
voice, reacts to pain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  A) Coronary artery disease.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**]
was transferred to the CCU for further observation and
evaluation.  She was continued on pressors.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] was
transferred on Dopamine and Dobutamine GTT.  Dobutamine was
weaned off on [**2124-11-24**].  Dopamine was unsuccessfully weaned
until [**2124-11-26**].  She was continued on Aspirin and Zocor.
Beta blockers, ACE inhibitors were all held until her
pressors were weaned.  She was placed on telemetry with
baseline 12 lead EKGs for interval checks.  Sotalol was held
secondary to a possible stimulus of arrhythmia.  EPS followed
her closely during her CCU course.  B) Pump.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] was
restarted on ACE inhibitor on [**2124-11-27**] after pressors were
weaned completely.  She was also placed on Digoxin at that
time for inotropic addition.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] underwent
catheterization on [**2124-11-29**] which showed the following:
Native three vessel disease with right sided dominance with
LAD diffusely diseased, subtotal occlusion of the middle
segment with competitive flow.  Diagonal was totally occluded
proximally.  Left circumflex had diffuse disease with a 60%
OM1 lesion.  On the right side RCA was diffusely diseased
with 95% mid lesion, right side PDA with 70% lesions and
competitive flow.  Graft disease showed the following: Patent
SVG to right PLV with retrograde filling of PDA, Y graft to
mid LAD/diagonal was patent.  Middle LAD was totally occluded
after touchdown.  SVC to OM was totally occluded.  The LIMA
to LAD was patent.  Overall there was diffuse hypokinesis
with left ventricular ejection fraction of 22%.  Cath also
revealed 2+ MR and 1+ AR which was less than previously
thought.

2.  Rhythm:  As stated before, she was followed closely by
electrophysiology.  Lidocaine was continued for several days
and weaned off on [**2124-11-26**].  Electrolytes were carefully
monitored and repleted as needed.  She continued to have
various beat runs of non sustained V tach which were self
limited.  On [**2124-11-30**] she underwent EP study with ICD
placement.  Of note, EP study was held off secondary to
report of severe MR.  However, when cath revealed that MR was
only mild disease, EPS study was completed without problems.
After ICD placement, chest x-ray was checked.  She was also
given antibiotics for prophylaxis, Vancomcyin q 12 hours.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] continued to be in normal sinus, and Coumadin
will be restarted after EPS procedure.  After EPS study, Mrs.
[**Known lastname 23440**] was started on Amiodarone 400 mg po q d for three
months which will then be decreased to 200 mg po q d.

3.  Pulmonary:  As stated above, Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] was intubated
during her code at outside hospital.  She was extubated [**11-27**]
without complications.  There was some question for possible
aspiration pneumonia, and she was started on Levaquin and
Flagyl.

4.  ID:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] had UTI by urinalysis and culture
showing greater than 100,000 colonies of Klebsiella.  She was
continued on Levaquin for approximately 7 days.  Repeat
urinalysis was bland with urine culture that has not grown
anything to date.

5.  Heme:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] was admitted after daily Coumadin.
INR began to climb, with peak INR of 8.4.  Coumadin had been
held since admission but at this time she was given Vitamin K
with good effect.  INR began to decrease and was 1.4 at time
of EPS study.
