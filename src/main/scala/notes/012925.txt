Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4917**]
Chief Complaint:
Septic shock, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. significant for
diabetes, hypertension, systolic CHF, and iron deficiency anemia
who is transferred from outside hospital with septic shock in
the setting of severe c.diff colitis.  Apparently patient was
being worked up for iron deficiency anemia and went for
colonoscopy on [**2118-5-27**].  Since that time he did not feel well,
with diarrhea and fevers up to 102 (unclear if he received
antibiotics peri-procedure).  He presented to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**6-1**] where he was found to be hypotensive and c.diff positive.
A CT scan of his abdomen showed pan-colitis without perforation.
 Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2118-6-3**] as WBC continued to
rise, lactate was high, and there was concern for toxic
megacolon.  While at [**Hospital1 **] cardiology was consulted for
persistent hypotension and an ECHO showed an EF of 15%.  [**Hospital1 **],
cardiology was consulted for persistent hypotension and
tachycardia, and an echo was done which showed EF of 15% (down
from 40% in past).  Creatinine also continued to rise.

Upon transfer, vs in MICU were 97.7, HR 127 was in a.fib,
108/74, 21, 93%. He was on phenylephrine and dobutamine until
[**2118-6-4**], during which time his blood pressures dipped from
60s-90s few times.  Was weaned off pressors and continued to do
well.  He was seen by surgery who recommended no intervention.
Patient was transferred to the floor on [**2118-6-5**].

He returned to the floor after a day or two, and developed
progressive renal failure, possibly [**1-6**] to hypotension. He
became anuric, developed altered mental status, with respiratory
distress. Profoundly acidemic, he was sent to MICU [**Location (un) 2452**].
Before initiating HD, he was tried on lasix/dobutamine, but EF
recently went from 30 --> 15%. He was initiated on HD; he didn't
tolerate bipap, did well on autoset cpap.  ECHO repeated at
[**Hospital1 18**] and found to be wnl (potentially on dobutamine). He was on
po vanc and IV flagyl for a while (had +cdiff at OSH, repeated
here and was negative) -- continue to treat for 14 day course.
Stopped flagyl [**2118-6-13**] because taking the PO vanc on a regular
basis. Had a S&S, he passed, he can eat.

He was downgraded from MICU to the floor, and did well. He had
pain on urination, which was improving. Bladder US revealed BPH,
so his tamsulosin was resumed at home doses (0.4mg QD). He
received PT for reconditioning. He resumed PO diet without
problem.

ROS:  Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, or persistent diarrhea.  He endorses a
good appetitie.

KUB [**2118-6-4**]: Consistent with ileus.

Bladder and kidney US [**2118-6-14**]:
FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 11.8 cm and the left kidney
measures 11.8 cm.  There is no hydronephrosis.  No cyst or stone
or solid mass is seen in either kidney.  No perinephric fluid
collection is identified.  A scant trace  of ascites is seen in
the right lower quadrant.  The amount of ascites is  decreased
since the prior ultrasound of [**2118-6-6**].  The pre-void
bladder is  moderately distended and is unremarkable.  Post-void
imaging was attempted;  however, the patient stated he was
unable to void.  The prostate is enlarged  with a volume of
about 90 mL.
IMPRESSION:  No hydronephrosis.  Enlarged prostate.  Distended
bladder.  Note is made that the patient was not able to void.

Echo repeated ([**2118-6-16**]):
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
inferoseptal segments. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness with
hypokinesis of the inferoseptal segments. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2118-6-9**], the
regional wall motion abnormalities are new. The LVEF has
decreased from 50% to 45%. Due to the limited nature of the
current study, a comprehensive comparison of all previously
mentioned parameters could not be made.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72-year-old gentleman with a pmhx significant for
systolic heart failure, HTN, diabetes type II, and BPH who was
transferred from OSH for septic shock in the setting of c.diff
colitis and required MICU care for a course complicated by [**Last Name (un) **]
causing ATN and requiring initiation of HD, CHF, hypotension,
and respiratory failure.

Active Diagnoses

# SEPTIC SHOCK [**1-6**] SEVERE C.DIFF: The pt presented to OSH for
endoscopy and colonoscopy for w/u anemia on [**5-27**]. He then went
to the [**Hospital1 **] ER on [**6-1**] with fever, abdominal pain, nausea and
vomitting and was found to have leukocytosis, pancolitis on CT,
and +c diff. There he received fluid resuscitation, was started
on PO vanco and flagyl and required blood pressure support. He
was found to have an EF of 15% (down from previous EF of 40%).
He was transferred to MICU [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of toxic
megacolon/sepsis on [**6-3**]. ACS was consulted and felt the abdomen
was not toxic. He was continued on vanco/flagyl in the MICU,
phenylephrine and dobutamine were weaned off, and he was
continued to require IVF
