Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for ERCP.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP on [**2129-2-14**].

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 71 y/o female with PMH significant for atrial fibrillation,
CAD, St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mitral valve replacement, and sclerosing
cholangitis admitted from OSH for an ERCP. Pt was in her normal
state of health until [**1-28**] when she noted that she felt more
"shakey" than usual. As the day progressed, the pt's family
noted that her movements were very slowed and she was not
thinking as clearly as normal. They wanted to take the pt to the
hospital but she initially declined. However, late that evening,
the pt was too weak to lift herself off of the toilet and fell
into the tub. Did not actually go to the ground but scraped her
leg so family called EMS to take her to the hospital.

At the time of admission to [**Hospital6 28728**] Center, the pt
was noted to be very lethargic and mildly confused. Admission
blood cultures at the OSH grew 4:4 bottles of enterococcus. This
was sensitive to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, genta,
tetracycline, and vancomycin. In addition, her WBC count was
elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 6085**]. Pt was placed on aldactone, unaxyn, and
gentamycin. ID and GI were consulted. A TEE was done that did
not show any vegitations so the gentamycin was discontinued at
that time. An abdominal US at this time was negative for
cholycystitis but showed cirrhosis and mild ascities. There was
a question of an intraparenchymal stone on the US. Blood
cultures from [**2-1**] were negative. Pt had three negative
cultures for C diff on [**1-30**] and [**1-31**]. Today's labs at the OSH
were significant for: WBC 12.9, Hct 36.5, Na 136, K 4.1,
chloride 106, bicarb 21, BUN 33, creatinine 1.2. Pt is now
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to receive an ERCP to evaluate for
strictures given her history of sclerosis cholangitis and
positive bacteremia.

In ROS, pt reports that she is feeling well at this time. No CP
or palpiations. No SOB. No abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
She reports that she has a fairly good appetite. Has not noted
any blood in her stools. Is anxious to work with PT as she does
not want to "loose ground" in her progress.

Past Medical History:
1. Sclerosing cholangitis- Pt reports that this was diagnosed
approximately 10 years ago. She is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] here at
[**Hospital1 18**].
2. S/P St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mitral valve replacement following an episode
of MV endocarditis. Was done at [**Hospital1 112**] on [**2128-9-30**]. Pt is
anticoagulated on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
3. H/O paroxysmal atrial fibrillation- This was found when pt
went to OSH for elective laminectomy on [**2128-8-24**]. At that
time, pt was treated with amioadarone, sotalol, and
cardioversion. It is unclear if pt has had episodes of atrial
fibrillation since her cardioversion.
4. [**Name (NI) **] Pt is s/p a non Q wave MI in 09/[**2127**]. Cath at that time
was negative per notes.
5. Depression
6. H/O acute mitral valve staph aureus endocarditis in the
setting of a line sepsis during [**8-/2128**] hospital course. Pt had
a large associated pericardial effusion. Pt also had posterior
annular abscess s/p debridement and patch.
7. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia in [**9-/2128**]
8. H/O acute renal failure requiring CVVH in 10/[**2127**]. Renal
function subsequently returned to baseline.
9. S/P pacemaker palcement for bradycardia and AV block on
[**2128-10-28**]
10. H/O GI bleed secondary to an AVM and/or portal hypertensive
gastropathy as seen on EGD and colonoscopy by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] in
01/[**2128**].
11. CHF with diastolic dysfunction
12. Ruptured disc at L4-L5
13. H/O multiple spinal compression fractures
14. H/O hepatic encephalopathy
15. Old left frontal watershed infarct- Likely secondary to
hypotension.

Social History:
Pt is a retired administrator. She lives with her daughter. [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 5656**] is also very involved and is her health care proxy.
Widowed from husband 25 yrs ago
Tob - Hasn't smoked for 25 years, [**12-19**] ppd x 15 years
Etoh - Occ has 1 glass wine at dinner
No IVDU
Pt smoked [**12-19**] PPD for 15 years but quit 25 years ago. Rare ETOH.
No drug use.

Family History:
Pt's older and younger brothers both had lymphoma. Unclear what
medical conditions her parents had.

Physical Exam:
Gen- Pleasant lady resing in bed. NAD. Alert and oriented x3.
HEENT- NC AT. PERRL. EOMI. Anicteric sclera. MMM. No lesions in
the oropharynx.
Neck- Supple. No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac- RRR. Loud mechanic S2 click that is loudest at the
apex. II/VI SEM at base. No carotid bruits.
Pulm- CTAB.
Abdomen- Soft. Moderately distended. NT. Positive bowel sounds.
No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities- No c/c/e. 2+ DP pulses bilaterally. Healing
abrasion on right lower extremity below knee from fall at home.
Neuro- Alert and oriented x3. CN II-XII intact. 4/5 strength in
upper and lower extremities bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
LIVER ULTRASOUND ([**2129-2-7**])
1) There are probably two intraductal stones in the right lobe
of the liver.
2) Hypoechoic lesion in segment 2 of the liver is unchanged when
compared to the prior study and is concerning. Recommend MRI of
the liver for further evaluation.
3) The portal vein is not well identified and there are
diminutive vessels in its region. This could represent cavernous
transformation of the portal vein secondary to thrombosis.
4) Moderate amount of ascites.
5) Edematous gallbladder most likely secondary to
hypoalbuminemia.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
On [**2-17**], patient developed severe diarrhea and leukocytosis. She
spiked a temp to 103.5 and WBC to 28. Her hematocrit also
dropped from 31.6 to 25.3. Her SBP also decreased to mid-70s.
The pt did not have any symptoms of lightheadedness or abdominal
pain.  After her BP failed to respond to IVF managment, she
satisfied the criteria for the sepsis MUST protocol. A sepsis
code was called, and she was evaluated and transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further BP management.

Blood pressure- Initially, patient received dopamine, continous
normal saline and pRBCs until BP stabilized. She was weaned off
pressors after three days and BP is well controlled.

Sepsis/ID- She has [**2-18**] blood cultures for enterobacter. Urine
cultures and U/A was negative. WBC stabilized and she remained
afebrile. C. diff assay x3 negative. CT abdomen consistent with
colitis. She was empirically treated with levofloxacin, flagyl,
ceftazidine and vancomycin.  These were all discontinued and she
was started on Imipenem/cilastin on [**2-21**]. Notably, she has a
recent history of positive blood cultures ([**2-7**]) at an OSH
([**Location (un) 1121**]) for enterococcus bacteremia.  Sensitive to CTZ -
treated for 2 week course, ended on [**3-4**], AF, stable,
surveillance cx. negative.

Hematologic- During her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course, she received a total of 5
units pRBCs and FFP to maintain her hematocrit. Her hematocrit
was followed serially and eventually stabilized, at which point
Coumadin was restarted in setting of heparin induced
thrombocytopenia and [**Hospital3 9642**] mitral valve replacement.  On
floor, required one unit of prbc, then stable hct, guaiac neg.
stools.

1. Sclerosing cholangitis- Pt presents to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH for
ERCP.  Liver ultrasound revealed likely intraductal stone and
stable hypoechoic lesion.  Patient was scheduled to get ERCP,
but her INR was 2.2 on transfer.  Due to her history of St.
Jude's valve, atrial fibrillation, and also a history of HIT,
decision was made to start renally dosed Lepirudin while
coumadin was held and INR was reversed.  Lepirudin was chosen
over argatroban because of her underlying liver disease.  INR
was lowered to 1.4 using vitamin K, and pt underwent successful
ERCP and sphin
