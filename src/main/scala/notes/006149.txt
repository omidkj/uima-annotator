Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
VTach Storm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Electrophysiology Study, Ablation [**2175-3-16**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 131**] is a 77M with PMH of severe cardiomyopathy with EF 15%
with [**Company 1543**] BiV ICD, Concerto 2 CRT-D D274TRK pacemaker and
hx of VTach storm, transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for
recurrent VTach. He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiomyopathy and [**Hospital1 **]-V pacing.  Patient noticed last week a few
intermittent episodes of lightheadedness and palpitations,
followed by ICD firing.  ICD fired 2 times en route to the
nearest OSH ED, 3 times at [**Hospital3 **] where he was
hospitalized for one week, and 2 more times on the morning of
transfer.  Patient denies chest pain/pressure or shortness of
breath associated with these episodes. He denies any other
symptoms, and has not felt more fatigued lately.
Patient's cardiac hx began with a MI in [**2146**] and another in
[**2153**].  He has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86069**] at [**Hospital1 **] for over 15
years since having an AICD placed.  In Fall [**2174**], patient had VT
ablation for recurreent episodes of VT.  He was discharged on a
maintenance dose of 400mg amiodarone, which has been tapered
down to 200mg in [**2174-11-29**] due to gait instability.
At the OSH, he was loaded with IV amiodarone x 2, and his rhythm
stabilized until morning of transfer when he was shocked 2 more
times from his ICD.  He was maintained on amiodarone and
mexilitine.  His SBP was chronically in the 80s-90s and he was
asymptomatic.
.
On review of systems, he endorses recent constipation, but no
blood or change in the color of his stools.  He denies any prior
history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2175-3-17**]**

   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2175-3-17**]):    NO GROWTH.

CXR [**3-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
Left-sided pacemaker with multiple leads is unchanged. Right
subclavian PICC line has its tip in the proximal SVC. The heart
remains markedly enlarged which may represent cardiomegaly,
although a pericardial effusion should also be considered. There
is elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with some adjacent
airspace opacity which may represent partial lower lobe
atelectasis with associated pleural effusion. Overall, this does
not appear to be significantly changed. No pulmonary edema.
Right lung is grossly clear.



Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
77M with PMH of severe cardiomyopathy with EF 15% with [**Company 1543**]
BiV ICD, Concerto 2 CRT-D D274TRK pacemaker and hx of VTach
storm, now s/p EP ablation and transferred back to CCU for
multiple runs of NSVT.

Active Diagnoses:
# VTach storm: Patient experienced VTach storm during week of
hospitalization, was shocked total of 7 times prior to transfer.
 Patient has a history of prior VTach storm, s/p EP ablation and
BiV pacing. Receive amiodarone load and gtt, all amiodarone
stopped on [**3-17**]. He was also started on Procainamide which has
now been discontinued per EP recs. He has been doing well but
has had numerous runs of NSVT necessitating start amiodarone gtt
and then lidocaine gtt on morning of [**3-17**], likely due to a few
remaining non-ablated VT focuses.  Procedure itself was
uncomplicated.  Lidocaine was DC??????d, and in the evening, patient
had more runs of NSVT.  NSVT persisted, roughly 3 episodes/day,
but patient asymptomatic and EP aware.  Per EP, patient will
likely continue to experience some NSVT.  Patient was called out
to the floor on [**3-20**], but in the early AM of [**3-21**], developed
escalating episodes of NSVT, with one series of 8 episodes of
15-25 beat runs within 3 minutes, the last two runs of which he
was ATP??????d.  After consulting EP, patient was bolused IV
lidocaine, transferred back to CCU, started on lidocaine drip.
Lidocaine drip has now been DC??????d in effort to aid clearance of
all antiarrythmics, and mexilitine has been increased to 150mg
TID in the interim. After patient experienced further persistent
runs of VTach, a decision was made to initiate him on quinidine
during this hospital stay.  Patient was discharged on Quinidine
amd Mexilitine. Amiodarone was DISCONTINUED.  He will follow-up
with his outpatient electrophysiologist to further titrate these
medications as amiodarone washes out of his system.

# Bleeding/Bruising.  Patient??????s INR was not entirely reversed
for procedure.  Received 3mg VitK total and one unit FFP prior
to procedure.  Patient had bleeding from right EJ site, left
forearm I and D site, and right groin catheterization site.  He
was transfused 1 unit of pRBC prophylactically for continued
bleeding. HCT is now trending down mildly. Bruises resolved well
during hospitalization, and he was restarted on anticoagulation,
maintaining INR [**3-3**].

# CHF: Most recent EF 20%.  Diuresis was held on admission as
patient was not felt to be volume overloaded and blood pressur
