History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 year old female with extensive PVD s/p
recent interventions, as well as known CAD and multiple
cardiovascular risk factors (HTN, IDDM), who is transferred from
[**Hospital6 33**] where she presented this a.m. from rehab
with chest pain and hypotension.  She was recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] after a stay from [**7-22**] - [**8-16**] during which time she
underwent multiple revascularization procedures of the RLE,
culminating with a R BKA on [**2151-8-10**] after multiple thrombosis of
stents/bypasses which had been placed.  She had a PICC placed
for intended 2 weeks of vancomycin (through [**8-30**]) - when exactly
this was placed is unclear, however appears to have been
sometime between [**7-27**] and [**8-9**], and was transferred to [**Hospital 38**]
rehab on [**8-16**].  Her hospital course also appears notable for a
UTI, treated with cipro from [**8-10**] through [**8-13**].

The patient says that she woke up this morning with a [**10-11**]
fleeting chest pain, lasting only seconds.  At that time, her
blood pressure was noted to be 60/palp, T 99.5.  Labs at
[**Location (un) 38**] were wbc 9.9, HCT 27.1, plt 672, BUN 24, creat 1.7.
She was transferred to [**Hospital6 33**] for further
management.  At [**Hospital3 **] her pressure was 86/palp and labs
were notable for WBC count of 23.1, hct 26.5 (stable), platelets
547, BUN/creat 25/2.1.  1st set of cardiac enzymes were negative
and an EKG was unchanged from baseline.  CXR was without
infiltrates, and possibly mild congestion.  She was given 1.5 L
NS, 1 dose of levaquin, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED her vitals were T 100.1, BP 73/30
non-invasively, HR 86, 99% on RA.  She was started on IVF, and
multiple A-line attempts were unsuccessful.  She had received 4
L lactated ringers in the ED prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], as
well as a dose of vancomycin.  She was started on dopamine with
increase of her blood pressure to around 110-120 systolic.  A
second set of cardiac enzymes were negative.  [**Hospital Unit Name **] surgery
saw the patient in the ED.

On review of systems the patient denies any recent cough,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain.  She does say she has had
dysuria, but denies hematuria.  She also is complaining of L 5th
toe pain.  ROS otherwise negative.

Past Medical History:
1. Severe peripheral [**Hospital Unit Name 1106**] disease status post right and left
femoral-popliteal bypass, underwent Rsided venous bypass in
[**10-6**] which failed, then underwent amputation below knee.
2. Status post thoracic aortic replacement for thoracic aortic
dissection approximately 10 years ago.
3. COPD.
4. CAD with 90% RCA and 60% LAD lesions by recent
catheterization.
5. Severe hyperlipidemia, cholesterol level of about 600 and
triglycerides of approximately 3,000.
6. Insulin dependent diabetes.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. Hypertension.
9. h/o Pancreatitis.
10. Degenerative joint disease status post laminectomy.
11. Status post cholecystectomy.
12. Status post right femoral embolectomy.
13. Obesity.

quit smoking about 2 months ago.  She denies any IVDU or alcohol
use.  She lives alone.  She has 3 children.


Family History:

Brief Hospital Course:
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], non-invasive blood pressure was thought to be
unreliable in this patient given her known severe PVD. She was
mentating well, with adequate UOP, making non-invasive BP seem
even less reliable.  Multiple a-line attempts were unsuccessful.
Patient was not tachypneic, not tachycardic, repeat WBC count
was within normal limits and lactate was 0. 2 sets of enzymes
were negative, EKG was unchanged and patient did not appear to
be in failure.  A cortisol stimulation test was performed and
the patient's response was determined to be adequate, ruling out
adrenal insufficiency.  The patient's hematocrit was stable and
there were no obvious sources of bleeding or volume loss. Blood
and urine cultures were sent. A repeat chest X-ray showed a
small pleural effusion, was consistent with mild congestive
heart failure but was not consistent with pneumonia. Vancomycin
was continued to cover staph/strep for presumed stump
cellulitis. Dopamine drip was continued.

R BKA site was with mild erythema, no exudate or fluctuance and
the PICC site was only mildly erythematous.  Patient did have a
murmur on exam that has been present on past hospitalizations.

Patient's BUN/creatinine was 25/1.9 which was elevated from
13/0.9 on [**2151-8-14**], concerning for an intrinsic renal process,
such as vancomycin nephrotoxicity.  However, with hydration,
patient's Creatinine decreased to 0.9 by hospital day 2.
Patient's blood pressure medications (lisinopril and beta
blocker) were held but niacin and gemfibrozil were continued.

Patient was complaining of left 5th toe pain, with mild mottling
on exam, concerning for thrombus vs. embolus vs. pressor
related. [**Date Range **] surgery was consulted and on exam the
appearance of the toe was thought to be due to ischemia.

On hospital day 2, patient was transferred to medicine service
from the intensive care unit. She was normotensive and afebrile
upon transfer.  Urine culture returned negative. Blood pressure
medications continued to be held as patient's pressure was not
elevated.

On hospital day 3, patient was complaining of severe LE pain so
pain regimen was switched to MS contin 30mg [**Hospital1 **] with dilaudid
2-4mg Q4-6hours as needed for breakthrough pain. The pain was
thought to be more neurogenic so her gabapentin was increased
from 300mg QD to 300mg [**Hospital1 **]. A physical therapy consult was
obtained. ON discharge, it was noted that pt was on lower dose
of neurontin while in-house; this may have contributed to
increased pain. Pt was restarted on home dose of neurontin. Pt
should try trial off ms contin to see if pain better controlled
on higher dose of neurontin; if not, should restart ms contin.
