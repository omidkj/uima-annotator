Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-5-19**] left internal jugular vein dialysis catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90678**] is an 82y/o gentleman with critical AS ([**Location (un) 109**]
<0.8cm2), Afib on Coumadin, CHF (EF 30-35%), HTN, HLD, DM II,
CKD IV (Cr ~4 baseline), and CML who presented to the ED with
shortness of breath and hemoptsysis and has been found to have
CHF exacerbation.

Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiology [**Date range (1) 90681**]
for CHF exacerbation in the setting of dietary indiscretion.
During that stay, he was diuresed with IV Lasix and transitioned
to 160mg PO BID. His stay was complicated by hematuria (had CBI
per Urology and was d/c'd to rehab with no foley), so his
Warfarin had been held on discharge. Also had [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD
(baseline Cr is 2.5, bumped to 4.8 likely from CIN, was down to
2.8 upon discharge). There have been ongoing outpatient
discussions about TAVI vs AVR (he has seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
consultation).

He has been doing okay at rehab but developed worsening DOE. Has
SOB at rest and any exertion, fatigue. He reports a 7 pound
weight gain in one week. Also had hemoptysis last night,
approximately 1 tablespoon, only once. He again notes dietary
indescretions (including pork loins, etc). In the ED, initial
vitals were 98.0 77 122/64 24 99% 2L Nasal Cannula. Labs notable
for WBC 17.2 (86.7%N, no bands), Hct 29 (which is baseline), Cr
2.7 (baseline 2.5), INR 2.6. Troponin 0.14, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 90682**]. Lactate
1.2. EKG showed atrial fibrillation per report, although this
EKG is not in the chart. CXR with bibasilar opacities and
pulmonary edema that is significantly worse when compared to
[**4-23**]. He received cefepime 2gm, vancomycin 1gm, furosemide 100mg
IV ONCE, ASA 325mg PO ONCE. A foley catheter was placed, which
drained 800cc and DNR/DNI status was confirmed.

No major overnight events.  His systolic BP has been ~100 so
lasix gtt has been on and off.  He is breathing OK this AM.  Is
hungry and tired from his long ED visit last night.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
(+) Red urine (but only since the foley was placed last night)
(-) No chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness.  No
constipation/diarrhea.  No rash.  No weakness,
numbness/tingling.

.
[**2187-5-16**] urine cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Degenerated urothelial cells, neutrophils and many red blood
  cells.
.
CXR PA&LAT [**2187-5-14**]:
Findings suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.  Incompletely
characterized right basilar opacification, which may reflect a
pleural
effusion, but is not well characterized.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2187-5-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Air outlines the anterior wall of the bladder which could
represent
cystitis in the appropriate clinical setting.  Additionally,
there is a focal area of heterogeneous dense material within the
bladder lumen which suggests a focal mass.  Urine cytology and
further assessment with either ultrasound or direct urological
evaluation should be considered.
2.  Minimal atherosclerotic calcification of the common and
external iliac and common femoral vessels.
3.  Increased trabeculation of the right ilium, consistent with
Paget's
disease.
.
CXR [**2187-5-19**]:
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from [**2187-5-14**].
There is a left IJ central venous catheter with distal lead tip
in the brachiocephalic vein.  This could be advanced several
centimeters for more optimal placement.  There are persistent
bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  There is
unchanged cardiomegaly.  There is mild pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**2187-5-23**]:
FINDINGS:  A single portable chest radiograph is limitted by low
lung volumes and mild rotation.  Mild pulmonary edema has
improved but there is now a small amout of fluid in the right
minor fissure.  A left internal jugular catheter tip remains at
the confluence of the left brachiocephalic and SVC.  Apparent
worsening of cardiomegally is likely secondary to technique.
FINDINGS:  Slight improvement in pulmonary edema.

KUB [**2187-5-23**]:
