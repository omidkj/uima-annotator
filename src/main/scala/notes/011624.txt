year old gravida 1, para 0 to 1 mother with prenatal screens
as follows:  0 negative, antibody negative, hepatitis B
surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune

significant for pregnancy-induced hypertension on [**2174-7-20**] prompting admission to [**Hospital6 2018**].  She was treated with Magnesium Sulfate, Labetalol,
Hydralazine and bedrest as well as betamethasone.  Fetal
testing revealed a biophysical profile of 8 out of 8 and an
estimated fetal weight of 792 gm.  On the morning of delivery
fetal heartrate decelerations were noted and the decision was
made to deliver by emergent cesarean section.  The baby
emerged with some tone and grimace.  He was treated with bulb
suction and bag mask ventilation with good response of crying
and spontaneous respirations.  Apgars scores were 6, 7 and 8
at one, five and ten minutes respectively.  The patient was
intubated at four to five minutes of life and was treated
with Surfactant.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed birthweight 811 gm, 40th to 50th percentile, length
33 cm, 25th percentile, head circumference 25.5 cm, 50th to
60th percentile.  The anterior fontanelle was soft and flat,
sutures mobile.  Eyes fused.  Palate intact.  Lungs clear and
equal, occasional standard rales, mild retractions.
Cardiovascular, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.  Perfusion
good.  Abdomen soft with no distention, no organomegaly,
three vessel cord, normal genitalia for gestational age.
Testes were not distended.  Neurological:  Tone appears
normal for gestational age.  Symmetric movements of upper and
lower extremities.  Hips stable.  Skin, appropriate for
gestational age, red and translucent.  No areas of
significant bruising or breakdown.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory - [**Known lastname **] received a total
of two doses of Surfactant with initial improvement of
respiratory distress and weaning of ventilator settings.
However, he developed acidosis and increased work of
breathing on day of life #1 and 2 due to a patent ductus
arteriosus.  This required increase in his ventilator
settings.  He self-extubated on day of life #39 ([**8-30**])
and successfully remained on CPAP.  He came off of CPAP on
[**2174-9-10**], on to nasal cannula oxygen.  He weaned down
on his nasal cannula oxygen and went into room air on
[**2174-10-9**].  He subsequently remained stable in room
air.  The patient was started on Aldactone and Diuril for
chronic lung disease during his hospitalization.  These were
discontinued on [**10-10**] and the patient has tolerated
this well.  He also apnea of prematurity and was started on
caffeine.  Caffeine was discontinued on [**2174-9-28**],
last episode of apnea of prematurity was [**2174-9-22**].

2.  Cardiovascular - [**Known lastname **] developed clinical signs and
symptoms consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus on day of
life #1.  He received one course of Indomethacin with no
residual patent ductus arteriosus on follow up
echocardiograms.  He has an intermittent murmur consistent
with peripheral pulmonic stenosis.  His last echocardiogram
was on day of life #13 which revealed no patent ductus
arteriosus, a small patent foramen ovale and peripheral
pulmonic stenosis were seen.

3.  Fluids - [**Known lastname **] was started on parenteral nutrition on
day of life #0, enteral feeds were started on day of life #9.
He advanced up to full feeds and caloric density was
gradually increased.  He was advanced to breastmilk 32
kcal/oz.  He was also started on sodium chloride and [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel
supplements.  His calories were reduced from 32 kcal/oz to 28
kcal/oz on [**10-9**] in anticipation for his discharge.
He continued to gain well on this regimen.  His sodium and
[**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel supplements were also discontinued prior to his
discharge and his electrolytes remained stable.  He is
currently on breastmilk 28 kcal/oz with 8 kcal/oz by NeoSure
powder, p.o. adlib feeds, taking greater than 120 cc/kg/day.
Weight on discharge 2125 gm.

4.  Gastrointestinal - The patient's bilirubins were
followed.  Bilirubin peaked oat 5.3 on day of life #1 and
phototherapy was initiated.  Phototherapy was continued until
day of life #7 and rebound bilirubin following
discontinuation of phototherapy was 2.8.  The patient had
bilateral inguinal hernias and then underwent bilateral
inguinal hernia repair on [**2174-10-8**] along with a
circumcision.  He subsequently developed a mild wound
infection and was treated with a five day course of Keflex.

5.  Infectious disease - [**Known lastname **] completed 48 hours of
Ampicillin and Gentamicin for initial rule-out sepsis.  There
was also the concern for the possibility of line sepsis with
Staphylococcus epidermidis around day of life #13 which was
treated with a ten day course of Vancomycin and Gentamicin.

6.  Hematology - [**Known lastname **] received multiple transfusions.
His last transfusion was on [**8-25**].  He was treated during
his hospitalization with iron and Vitamin D.  He continues on
iron supplementation at the time of discharge.

7.  Neurology - [**Known lastname **] had screening head ultrasounds on
day of life #4 and day of life #11 which revealed no evidence
of interventricular hemorrhage.  His 60 day head ultrasound
revealed no evidence of white matter disease.

8.  Ophthalmology - [**Known lastname **] initial eye examination on
[**9-14**] revealed retinopathy of prematurity with Stage 1,
Zone 2 on the right and Stage 2, Zone 2 on the left.  His
retinopathy of prematurity did not progress and his most
recent examination on [**10-3**] revealed bilateral
premature retina in Zone 3 with no evidence of retinopathy of
prematurity.

9.  Audiology - He passed his hearing screen bilaterally.
