History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with recent hip fx, multiple prior GI bleeds, h/o of st
jude valve and ESRD on HD, presents from rehab with incidental
finding of anemia at HD. Pt was noted to have Hct 19.4 at
dialysis, in setting of INR 4.4, for which she received 2U
pRBCs. Pt's Hct only bumpted to 20 and thus pt referred to ED
for evaluation. She was unaware of any change in her state of
health, denying lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain,
palpitations, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or abdominal
pain. She described her stool as dark brown but denied red or
black ostomy output, hematuria, or any trauma.

In the ED: initial vitals were : T98.6 HR150(inaccurate)
BP120/42 RR18 O291%RA.  EKG normal sinus. NG lavage was
preformed and showed minimal coffee ground blood which cleared
quickly. Exam was otherwise normal and ROS negative as above.

Labs were significant for
CBC: Hct 22.6, Cr 5.5, CEs neg x 1, INR 3.3 without any vit K.
Pt given IV PPI drip, typed and crossed but not given blood
prior to transfer. Access was difficult as left arm off limits
due to fistula, right IJ clotted, were unable to get femoral
access and ultimatelly had AC and EJ 18G PIVs placed. Renal was
informed and plan for HD tomorrow after transfusion. Prior to
transfer pt's vitals were T98.2, HR78, BP129/46, RR12, O2100%.

Past Medical History:
1. repeated Hx of gastrointestinal bleeding (most recent
[**Month (only) 116**]/09, found to have GE junction polyp, clipped, recommended
repeat in 6-8wks, not done)
2. Left hemicolectomy with transverse colostomy for GIB [**11-13**],
found to have severe diverticulosis, no particular source of
bleeding found
3. Diastolic CHF (EF 65-75%) on 2L O2
4. Status post tracheostomy placement after prolonged intubation

in ICU (at time of colectomy) - removed
5. Severe AS s/p mechanical AVR, [**Hospital3 **], goal INR [**2-11**]
6. Hypertension
7. Elevated cholesterol
8. Diabetes type 2
9. End-stage renal disease on HD MWF (via LUE AVF revised on
[**11-16**])
10. Bilateral total knee replacment
11. Multiple skin lesions removed by general and plastic surgery

12. Hypothyroidism
13. Presumptive history of atrial fibrillation; on amiodarone

Pertinent Results:
[**10-22**] LEFT HIP SOFT TISSUE ULTRASOUND: Focused son[**Name (NI) 493**]
examination performed
over the soft tissues of the left hip reveals no discrete
hematoma.

IMPRESSIONS: No discrete hematoma seen in the soft tissues
overlying the left hip.

[**10-27**] HCT 29.3
[**10-26**] HCT 28.3
[**10-25**] HCT 27.2

[**10-23**] EGD- No abnormal findings to explain melena. [**Month (only) 116**] have to
evaluate for AVMs in SB with capsule study and if negative, a
Meckel's scan as well.
Endoscope induced traumatic [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tears with minimal
bleeding noted in distal third of esophagus Normal stomach.
Normal duodenum

[**10-23**] COLONOSCOPY- A few diverticula with medium openings were
seen in the transverse colon and ascending colon. Diverticulosis
appeared to be of moderate severity. Diverticulosis of the
transverse colon and ascending colon Otherwise normal
colonoscopy to cecum
 No clear source of lower GI bleed noted. Recommend capsule
study to rule out AVMs and also a meckel's scan


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] 82 year-old lady with coronary artery disease,
mechanical aortic valve replacement, on coumadin, history of GI
bleeds, end-stage renal disease due to diabetes and
hypertension, on hemodialysis, who presented from rehab with
findings of anemia at hemodialysis and inappropriate hematocrit
response to blood transfusion.

1. GI BLEED- Ms. [**Known lastname **] was intially admitted to the ICU on
[**10-21**] due to her history of multiple GI bleeds; she was
transfused 2 units of blood. She was transferred to the general
medical service on [**10-22**] and was hemodynamically stable. She was
evaluated by gastroenterology prior to transfer, who recommended
stopping coumadin and bridging her with heparin gtt in order to
allow her INR to decrease to a level safe for
endoscopy/colonoscopy. She underwent endoscopy/colonoscopy on
[**10-23**] without complications. No active source of bleeding was
identified, although colonoscopy revealed several diverticulae.
She has a history of ateriovenous malformations which could be
related to Aortic Stenosis (essentially, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 30060**] syndrome) or
to end-stage kidney disease and hemodialysis. GI recommended
outpatient capsule endoscopy to better evaluate the small bowel,
which could be a potential source of bleed. She is scheduled for
capsule endoscopy on [**11-3**].

2. MECHANICAL AORTIC VALVE- Ms [**Known lastname 47133**] outpatient regimen of
3mg Coumadin daily was held until INR was 2.5 and bridged with
heparin so she would be appropriate for GI procedure on [**10-23**].
After procedure, her Coumadin was re-started without a need for
heparin bridging as INR was 2.1. She was discharged on her home
regimen of 3mg daily and will need close INR follow-up. INR was
2.1 on day of discharge.

3. END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE- Patient is on Monday, Weds, Friday
dialysis schedule and received dialysis on [**9-14**] and
[**10-27**]. Nephrocaps and sevalemer were continued. She received 2
units of blood at dialysis on [**10-24**] due to a HCT of 23.1. Her
HCT had been around 23-25 throughout the remainder of her
hospital course, and she was asymptomatic. She has outpatient
renal follow-up.
