Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Extubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 y/o gentleman with CAD, diastolic CHF,
self-reported multiple sclerosis, schizoaffective disorder,
narcissistic personality disorder, which contribute to his
frequent medication noncompliance, and multiple admissions &
intubations for COPD exacerbations. He presented to the ED with
shortness of breath and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory
failure which required intubation in the ED.
.
Of note, he has no documented PFTs but he is prescribed COPD
medications. When he is admitted, CXR usually does not show
hyperinflation or pulmonary edema, usually does show asymmetric
atelectasis (right worse than left).
.
He was last hospitalized for COPD in [**2124-3-30**], and was last
intubated in [**2123-4-30**]. He came to the ED today complaining of 2
weeks of fever/chills/cough/gradual dyspnea, with acute
worsening of his dyspnea over the past day. He was extremely
nervous, was tachypneic to the 40's, and had difficulty speaking
more than one word at a time.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T99 rectal, BP 123/79, HR 132, SaO2
low 90s%, RR12.
He was diaphoretic and cool, and had expiratory wheezes. No
peripheral edema. He was given Solumedrol 125mg, Abx, and nebs.
He was persistently tachycardic despite small fluid bolus. He
was tried on BIPAP and nonrebreather with SaO2 100%, but he
continued to be tachypneic to the 40s. He became less responsive
and was intubated.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is intubated and sedated on Propofol,
arousable to painful stimulus but not following commands.

Past Medical History:
COPD s/p multiple intubations: h/o refusal to use prednisone or
BIPAP. Not on home O2 due to insurance issues.
CAD s/p "at least 3" MI's with multiple cardiac
catheterizations, per patient report
chronic diastolic CHF
steroid-induced diabetes mellitus type II, uncontrolled
Multiple sclerosis per patient: states he was diagnosed 2 years
ago, followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 12838**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 69783**]. However, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 12838**] had no record of patient.
Diverticulosis s/p bowel resection
obesity
narcissistic personality disorder
schizoaffective personality disorder


Social History:
He is married, but his wife resides in a state psychiatric
facility. He currently lives alone in CT although he has been
spending time in the past few weeks with friends or family. He
has a supportive cousin named [**Name (NI) 11894**]. [**Name2 (NI) **] is on disability.
History of smoking with unknown # of pack years, currently
denies smoking, ETOH, or recreational drug use.

Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly

CXR [**9-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with atelectasis, but no acute
cardiopulmonary process.
.
Chest CT [**9-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Resolution of right upper lobe consolidation since [**2123-5-22**]
with residual bilateral lower lobe and right middle lobe
atelectasis and new superior segment of left lower lobe
consolidation.
2. Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is suboptimal. There
is no evidence of a central pulmonary embolism nor is there
evidence of right heart strain but a segmental embolism cannot
be excluded on the basis of this study.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY FROM THE ICU:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50y/o gentleman w/ little confirmed PMH and
underlying psychiatric disorders and substance abuse who was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after being intubated for respiratory
distress.
.
#. Hypoxic/Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure:
Unclear etiology. Pt agitation likely playing a role as he was
significantly agitated in the ED before intubation. In the past,
he has had similar presentations and improved clinically after
treatment for COPD, though he has no documented obstructive
disease and low lung volumes on CXR convincing for COPD. Per pt
there is diagnosis of CHF, but TTE showed normal EF and only
mild LV dilatation and did not appear grossly volume overloaded
on exam. Pt was started on oral prednisone and
albuterol/ipratropium inhalers and azithromycin for presumed
COPD flare. There was low suspicioin for PNA. Tox screen
negative except for benzos/opiates in urine on sample taken
after pt given both for vent sedation. BNP was 57 and 144 on
repeat. CTA showed resolution of right upper lobe consolidation
since [**2123-5-22**] with residual bilateral lower lobe and right
middle lobe atelectasis and new superior segment of left lower
lobe consolidation. No evidence of central PE. Concern for
increased shunt fraction and so ECHO with bubble study was done.
Poor study with no evidence of shunt on bubble portion with ECHO
showing mild symmetric LVH. LV cavity is mildly dilated. There
is mild global LV hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40%). Bronchoscopy
showed mild mucous plugging and yielded negative culture data.
Initial attempt made to taper oral steroids but stopped at 40mg
due to worsening wheezing. Then pt stated that oral steroids did
not help him and refused to take them, so IV methylprednisolone
was started and then tapered. Pt very agitated on vent but
showed improvement in lung status. There was concern for volume
overload [**2-1**] to resuscitation contributing to hypoxia, and IV
lasix was started on [**9-20**] with good response. Extubated on [**9-22**]
and transitioned to PO lasix on [**9-23**]. Still requir
