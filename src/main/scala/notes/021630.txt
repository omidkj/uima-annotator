Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Right face, arm, and leg weakness and aphasia.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV TPA

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 year old man with atrial fibrillation, not
currently on coumadin, who was in his usual state of health
until
early in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year.  At that time, he began to
experience worsening urinary retention, was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**],
and was switched from avodart and finasteride to flomax.

On [**8-25**], the patient re-presented with the complaint of
lightheadedness and dizziness; INR at that time was 2.9.
Neurology was consulted for these symptoms and felt that the
patient??????s symptoms were likely due to his hyponatremia, CHF, and
UTI.  The patient was admitted to Medicine, treated with fluid
restriction and lasix for the CHF, and antibiotics for his UTI.
He developed hematuria which was thought to be secondary to
traumatic foley placement in the setting of his enlarged
prostate.  Coumadin was discontinued for this reason, and the
patient??????s INR was 1.2 at the time of discharge on [**8-31**].  The
patient was instructed NOT to restart coumadin until his
follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 261**] on [**9-12**].

At 6pm this evening, the patient was speaking with two of his
family members at Rehab when he developed the acute onset of
??????confusion?????? and right-sided weakness. EMS found the patient to
be
normotensive at 136/74 and in afib; they noted right face, arm,
and leg weakness and an aphasia.  The patient was transported to
[**Hospital1 18**] ER.

Stroke code was activated at 6:49pm.  The Neurology resident was
at the bedside within 2 minutes, and the stroke fellow arrived
soon thereafter.

At the time of this initial neurologic examination, a careful
screening for TPA exclusion criteria was carried out with the
patient and his son.  The patient??????s recent hematuria was noted
to
constitute a relative contraindication; however, the patient had
no absolute contraindications to receipt of IV TPA.

The patient was transferred to the CT scanner.  We were
redirected to a second scanner upstairs, due to the fact that
the
ED scanner was occupied by a trauma code.  Full scanning
sequence
(CT/CTA/CTP) was finished at ~7:50pm.  The case was discussed by
telephone with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and a plan was formulated. A call
was placed down by this author to the patient??????s ED nurse,
informing her of our plan to give IV TPA.  The patient was
brought back to the ED, his son was informed of our findings and
plan to administer TPA, and the bolus was given at ~7:55pm.
Approximately 5 minutes elapsed between conclusion of
information-gathering and administration of the TPA bolus.

ago)

heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and
thyroid disorder.

Vitals: Afebrile BP 140/71 General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated. No nuchal rigidity

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented to person.  Able to follow
commands, but shows some signs of perseveration.  Identifies [**3-23**]
objects on NIH stroke card.  Unable to read sentences, however
does not make an effort, simply holds them in front of him.  Has
difficulty identifying R and L, pointing instead.  Does not
cooperate with repetition.  Only intermittantly notices stimuli
on the R, and extinguishes to double stimulation.
-Cranial Nerves:  I: Olfaction not tested.   II: PERRL 3 to 2mm
and brisk.  Unable to identify stimuli in R temporal field. III,
IV, VI: Slight decrease in R lateral gaze.  Normal saccades.  V:
Facial sensation intact to light touch.  VII: R sided facial
droop VIII: Hearing intact to voice. IX, X: Palate elevates
symmetrically.   [**Doctor First Name 81**]: 5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM
bilaterally.  XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.
-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. Right sided pronator
drift.

Pertinent Results:
CT/CTA/CTP

Extensive small vessel ischemic changes are seen in the
subcortical and
periventricular white matter. Additionally, there is a subtle
hypodensity in the left frontal lobe concerning for acute
ischemia. There is no evidence for acute hemorrhage.

Source images and MIP images of the CTA demonstrates a
hypoplastic left
vertebral artery. No hemodynamically significant stenosis is
seen in the
carotid arteries. There is extensive cavernous carotid
calcification. No
occlusion in the intracranial vasculature is seen nor is there
hemodynamically significant stenosis. CTP images demonstrate no
large areas of asymmetric perfusion. Extensive calcification is
noted in the left carotid bifurcation in the neck as well as in
the aortic arch. On the MIP images, no hemodynamically
significant stenosis is seen in the carotid bifurcations.

MRI brain: Acute infarct in the left ACA territory. there is a
small area of hemorrhagic conversion of the left ACA infarct

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 82-year-old male admitted on [**2158-9-2**] for aphasia
and right-sided weakness. He has a history of atrial
fibrillation, was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for lightheadedness
and hyponatremia, and was taken off Coumadin due to hematuria,
was recently diagnosed with metastatic spread of prostate cancer
to his pelvic rami, ribs, and paraortic lymph nodes.  Patient
was found to have acute onset of right-sided weakness and
"confusion" by family, and had NIHSS of 10.  CT head, CTA
head/neck, and CTP did not reveal any acute process.

Hospital course by problem:

1) Neurology; Patient had initial negative imaging as described
above but given his acute onset of deficits, was given IV TPA
and admitted to the NeuroICU.  An MRI brain confirmed a left A
