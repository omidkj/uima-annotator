Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Dynamic
interatrial septum. PFO is present. Normal/small IVC diameter
(<=1.5cm) with respiratory collapse (estimated RAP 0-5mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Normal
LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Mild regional LV
systolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal and mid inferior wall hypokinesis and
thinning.. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
Improved LV focal systolic function. EF = 50-55%
No other change

CHEST PA AND LATERAL.

COMPARISON: [**2113-10-12**], chest portable line placement.

HISTORY: Pneumothorax and status post CABG.

FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of ET tube, Swan-Ganz
catheter, NG tube, and chest tubes. There is no pneumothorax. A
small area of left lower lobe atelectasis is identified, and
slightly smaller in appearance since prior exam. There are no
focal consolidations or effusions identified.

IMPRESSION: Area of left lower lobe atelectasis, slightly
improved. No evidence of pneumothorax.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-12**] and underwent CABG x3 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on titrated
neosynephrine and propofol drips. Extubated later that day and
transferred to the floor on POD #1 to begin increasing his
activity level. Gently diuresed toward his preoperative weight.
Chest tubes and pacing wires removed without incident. Beta
blockade slowly titrated, and he was restarted on his home
diabtes medications. He continued to do well and he was ready
for discharge [**Last Name (un) **] eon POD #6.
