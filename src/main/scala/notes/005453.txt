Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypertensive Urgency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
81 year old Spanish speaking man with history of Type 2 DM, CAD,
poorly controlled hypertension, diastolic HF and aortic stenosis
with multiple hospitalizations for hypertensive
urgency/emergency, transferred from medicine service where he
was admitted [**Date range (1) 82401**] with hypertension and chest pain. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] 4 Inpatient Psychiatry the day prior to
admission for management of his anxiety. He was initially
admitted to the medical service with chest pain in the setting
of hypertension. For his hypertension, cardiology was consulted
and recommended the addition of spirnolactone and lorsartan. His
BP control improved with the above regimen and management of his
anxiety which was felt to keep him from adequately taking care
of himself at home. On admission, he was also noted to be
hyponatremic to 120. This was felt to be related to HCTZ that
was recently started. His HCTZ was discontinued and he was
placed on a fluid restriction with normalization of sodium.

On [**9-14**], Medicine was consulted for blood pressure [**Location (un) 1131**] of
223/113.  On repeat, he is noted to have a SBP 160/80 without
intervention.  The patient was noted to have headache, shortness
of breath and chest pain.  He received his BP medications, and
his symptoms resolved.  At approximately 3 PM, the patient had
recurrence of his symptoms.  At this time, he complained of
bibasilar headache, as well as darkened vision, which he states
is new for him.  He was given Hydralazine 20 mg, Norvasc 10 mg.
ECG showed AFib with ST depressions laterally, unchanged from
prior.  Given concern of the new headaches and vision changes,
he was thus admitted to the MICU for further workup and
evaluation.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient states that he continues to
have pressure in his left chest.  He states that it is
non-radiating, and he denies associated symptoms.  The pain is
mid-epigastric, and he says that it has been present since
earlier this morning. This resolved prior to discharge from the
MICU,

Ultimately he was called out to the floor, with plans for
continued management. On the floor he was noted occaisionally
removing his clonidine patch, whic hwas moved onto his back. His
blood pressure was markedly high prior to getting his morning
medications and when he becomes severely anxious. This was
particularly true when his son is present on the [**Hospital1 **].

PERTINENT LABS/STUDIES:

CT HEAD ([**9-15**]): A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. There is no
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, mass, or mass effect. There are
periventricular white matter hypodensities which are likely
related to chronic ischemic microvascular disease. Again noted
are coarse calcifications within the right frontal lobe, left
frontal lobe, and left cerebellar hemisphere. Prominent
bifrontal extra-axial spaces are again noted and may be related
to atrophy. The calvarium is intact. Vascular calcifications are
noted along the carotid siphons and basilar artery.

CXR ([**9-14**]): As compared to the previous examination, the fluid
marking of the minor fissure has decreased. The pre-existing
right basal opacities have completely resolved. The extent of
the pre-existing left basal opacities appears to be unchanged.
Unchanged mild cardiomegaly, minimal signs indicating
overhydration. Apparent blunting of the left costophrenic sinus
could be projectional, however, a small left-sided pleural
effusion cannot be excluded.

RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2157-9-15**] 10:10 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Technically limited Doppler examination due to the patient's
inability to hold his breath. Tardus parvus waveform seen in the
main renal artery
bilaterally which may indicate a bilateral renal artery stenosis
or could also indicate intrinsic renal disease. We also note
that the prior scan from [**2157-6-3**] showed normal waveforms, quite
different from today's exam.
A CTA or MRA could be performed if clinically appropriate to
further assess the renal arteries.
2. No hydronephrosis.
3. Stable bilateral renal cysts.


CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2157-9-16**] 6:40 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Atherosclerotic disease of the descending aorta and branch
vessels with no evidence of significant renal artery stenosis
bilaterally. There is an early branching of the mid to lower
pole right renal artery with very mild narrowing at the take-off
of less than 50% stenosis.
2. Stable nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland.
3. Increased pelvic sclerosis, partly visualized, suggesting
Paget's disease. A pelvic CT with a bone protocol is recommended
when clinically feasible.
4. Follow-up of adrenal nodules and multiple renal hypodense
lesions
recommended in one year by CT in order to establish stability,
given that
several are either too small to characterize but incompletely
characterized, while two show calcifications.


ECG Study Date of [**2157-9-14**]  1:35:08 PM
Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 76. Diffuse
non-diagnostic
repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2157-9-8**] thereis no diagnostic change.
