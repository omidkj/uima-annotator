History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 40 year-old left-handed Indian woman with no
significant past medical history who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
[**2187-12-30**] after being struck by a motor vehicle.
The patient's family explained that she was in her usual state
of
health until the accident.  Although she and her husband live in
PA, they are visiting relatives in the [**Name (NI) 86**] area.  The patient
apparently left her relatoves' home independently prior to the
accident so her family is unaware of the details of the
collision.  Some of the reports suggest she was thrown 50 feet.
Reports indicate she was intubated for airway protection soon
after the accident.

[**2187-12-30**] Head CT : No acute intracranial hemorrhage

[**2187-12-30**] CT Torso : 1. Grade 1 to 2 splenic laceration without
associated subcapsular hematoma or hemoperitoneum.

[**2188-1-1**] MRI Head : 1. Multiple small foci of FLAIR
hyperintensity in the cerebral sulci at the vertex/adjacent
cortex, which may relate to small areas of hemorrhage, given the
history. Evaluation for [**Doctor First Name **] and presence of blood products in
the brain parenchyma, is significantly limited due to extensive
artifacts. Study is extremely suboptimal for this evaluation and
[**Doctor First Name **] cannot be excluded.
2. Small right-sided subdural fluid collection with mild
displacement of the cerebral parenchyma, with a transverse
dimension of 4.5 mm. Followup with CT recommended.

[**2188-1-1**] MRI C Spine : 1. No acute injury to the cervical spine
or cord signal abnormality is present.
2. Central disc herniation at C4-5 deforms the ventral cord
surface without frank cord compression or abnormal cord signal.

[**2188-1-1**] Head CT :
1. Mild asymmetric prominence of the extra-axial space overlying
the right
frontal lobe, with CSF-attenuation, unchanged since concurrent
MR examination performed at 12:00 p.m. This may relate to
pre-existent frontal atrophy, or alternatively, subdural hygroma
or resorbed hematoma.
2. No acute hemorrhage is seen.
3. Chronic-appearing inflammatory disease involving,
predominantly, right-
sided paranasal sinuses, with a pattern suggestive of underlying
sinonasal
polyposis; this should be correlated clinically.

[**2188-1-4**] EEG : This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing
and
disorganization of the background rhythm consistent with a mild
to
moderate encephalopathy. Medications, toxic/metabolic
disturbances, and
infections are common causes. Additionally, there is
intermittent focal
slowing in the left temporal region suggestive of possible
subcortical
dysfunction in this area. No epileptiform discharges or
electrographic
seizures were seen during this recording.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the Emergency Room by the Trauma
Service and intubated as her GCS was 7. She was then admitted to
thw Trauma ICU for further care.  She had a splenic laceration
and her hematocrit drifted to 19 requiring 2 units of packed red
blood cells. Her hematocrit stabilized but more concerning was
her mental status.  She was very slow to wake up and when she
did had a notable right sided weakness along with anisicoria
which was an old finding.  Her initial Head Ct was negative but
due to her neurologic findings she had an MRI done which showed
a possible small right subdural hematoma.  The study was
inconclusive for [**Doctor First Name **].  She was followed closely by the neurology
service daily and over time was able to respond appropriately to
some commands, not all.  She continued to have right sided
weakness which may indicate a left hemispheric stroke. An EEG
was done as her MRI did not show a stroke.  The EEG showed mild
metabolic encephalopathy, no seizure activity and intermittent
slowing of the left temporal area suggesting possible
subcortical dysfunction.

In order to protect her airway and facilitate vent weaning she
underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy as well as a PEG tube
placement for nutrition.  She was easily weaned off the
ventilator to a trach collar but required vigorous pulmonary
toilet including nebulizer treatments, chest PT and suctioning.

Following transfer to the Trauma floor she continued to make
good progress.  She was able to consistently follow commands and
seemed to recognize her family.  Her mental status improved
daily and as her secretions decreased, her trach was downsized
and subsequently capped.  She was able to speak softly and
answer questions appropriately.  She was decannulated on [**2188-1-17**]
and has not had any problems since.

After a swallowing evaluation she was advanced to pureed foods
and thin liquids`and her tube feedings were cycled.  She was
placed on calorie counts prior to discontinuing her tube
feedings. Her oral intake improved and she was meeting her
caloric requirements on a daily basis. Her G tube will be
removed in 2 weeks when she returns to her doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 760**].
