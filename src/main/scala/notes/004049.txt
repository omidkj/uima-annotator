Chief Complaint:
SOB x 1 day, Cough x 1 week

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a retired security officer with a cadiac history
significant for chronic systolic CHF with an EF 10% with ICD,
CAD significant for single vessel LCx disease, Vfib arrest in
[**2102**] with ICD, PAF, HTN, Dyslipidemia, DM2 (last Hgb AIC 10.3)
and COPD (not on home O2) who presented one day of dyspnea.
Of note the patient has been hospitalized four times this year
for CHF exacerbation. His last hospitalization was in [**Month (only) **], and
he was in rehab for six weeks thereafter. Per the patient, he
typically begins to feel short of breath for a days when he has
a CHF exacerbation. Unlike prior exacerbations, he notes that he
felt acutely short of breath while taking a shower prior to
presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. This dyspnea has also been
accompanied by a productive cough for the past week, without any
antecedent illnesss, fever, chills, sick contacts, or recent
travel. He also says that feels fluid overload, and similar to
his previous CHF exacerbations. He reports no recent changes in
his medication or dietary indegression. He also reports no
recent palpitations, syncope, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest
pain, PND, orthopnea, calf or buttock claudication or ICD
discharges. He was able to lay supine the other day, but is
unable to do so today.
At home, he is able to walk three blocks in 30 minutes while
resting frequently. He feels fatigued during these episodes, but
not short of breath. He also reports no dyspnea at rest. His
blood sugars at home have been in the 200's and his BP has been
150-170's by automated cuff.
ROS: Negative for dysuria, BRBPR, melena, nausea, emesis, or
diarrhea.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 113-118 HR (up to 150), 107/63
97% 3-5L RR 25 Afebrile. He had Afib with RVR and was given 3
doses of dilt and IV digoxin for a low dilt level. Labs and a
CXR were taken. A lactate was 7.1.

Upon arrival to the CCU his vitals were: 98.5, 97, 128/76, 17,
91% 4L
He was chest pain free and had a productive cough with clear
sputum.

Admission Studies:
ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left bundle-branch
block. Diminished limb lead voltage compared to the previous
tracing of [**2114-3-24**] and, compared with tracing of [**2114-8-26**], sinus
rhythm has appeared.

CXR [**8-26**]
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, with central vascular congestion and
likely
bilateral small effusions, compatible with congestive failure.

CXR [**8-29**]
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

Small-to-moderate left and moderate right pleural effusions are
unchanged.  Bibasilar opacities, right greater than left, are
likely atelectases. There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. ICD
leads are unchanged. There is no evident pneumothorax or new
lung abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
71 y/o male with cadiac history significant for chronic systolic
CHF with an EF 15% with ICD, CAD significant for single vessel
LCx disease, Vfib arrest in [**2102**] with ICD, PAF, HTN,
Dyslipidemia, DM2 (last Hgb AIC 10.3) and COPD (not on home O2)
who presented one day of dyspnea, cough, and elevated lactate,
in the absence of leukocytosis or fever.  His working diagnosis
this admission was CHF decompensation in the setting of a COPD
exacerbation.

# Systolic CHF Decompensation: Aggressively diuresed this
admission with Lasix and transitioned to PO torsemide for
discharge. Discharged home in hemodynamically stable and
clinically euvolemic condition on Torsemide, Spironolactone,
Lisinopril, and Metoprolol as detailed below.
.
# AF RVR: In the ED he had a rapid ventricular rate to the
150's.  He was given IV dig for a low dig level.  Upon arrival
to the floor his ECG demonstrated SR in the 90's, but thereafter
he continued to convert his rhythm between sinuse and Afib while
remaining hemodynamically stable.  He was maintained at a
therapeutic INR on warfarin, his amiodarone was continued for
the duration of the admission and he was sent home on
Amiodarone, Digoxin, Metoprolol, and Warfarin as detailed below.

.
# COPD Exacerbation:  Wheezing on presentation thought to be due
to CHF decompensation as well as COPD flare. Symptomatically
improved with ipratropium nebs and a 5 day
prednisone/azithromycin cours
