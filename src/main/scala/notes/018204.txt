Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
admission for elective pacemaker placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation x 2

arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 96908**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with COPD on 2 liters O2, DM
Type II, HTN, diastolic heart failure with preserved EF, who
presents from his [**Hospital3 **] facility for evaluation for
pacemaker.  The pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) 96910**] with respiratory distress/pneumonia requiring
intubation. During that admission, he had pauses lasting [**5-13**]
seconds, for which he was evaluated by EP.  EP was concerned for
bradycardia in the setting of respiratory failure and
recommended re-evaluation when pneumonia and COPD exacerbation
cleared.  He was discharged with KOH monitoring.  Yesterday
morning, the pt was found difficult to arouse for a few seconds
by nursing staff.  Per report, he came to within seconds.  He
reports that he was in a "deep sleep" but was aware of what was
going on and did not lose consciousness at any point.  He was in
bed at the time, he did not hit his head or suffer any trauma.
Denies headache, CP, SOB.  No tongue biting or post-ictal state
was observed.  HR was ~50s. Nothing was recorded on his KOH
monitor at the time.  He initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
yesterday afternoon.  EKG was sinus bradycardia.  CT head was
negative.  CXR showed almost complete resolution of his prior
pneumonia.  After discussion with cardiology and family, it was
felt that patient should be admitted for pacemaker placement.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] today for evaluation.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient reports that he feels
"lousy".  Specifically he complains of right knee pain, though
denies any recent injury.  Otherwise, pt denies fever, chills,
lightheadedness or dizziness, chest pain, SOB, cough, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting.

.
CXR [**7-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right basilar and left lingula opacities are slightly
decreased.
2. No acute change compared to [**2189-6-14**]
.
CXR [**7-11**]:
REASON FOR EXAM: Intubated patient with respiratory failure.
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
ET tube and NG tube are in standard position. Multifocal
consolidations in
the lower lobe are unchanged consistent with pneumonia. There
are no new lung abnormalities. There is no pneumothorax or
enlarging pleural effusions.
.
CTA chest [**7-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Resolving pneumonia in setting of severe emphysema sufficient
to explain respiratory findings. Small left pleural effusion
probably of no active clinical significance. No pulmonary
emboli.
2. Severe emphysema, sufficient to explain possible pulmonary
arterial
hypertension.
.
EKG [**7-2**]:
Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Poor R wave
progression
likely a normal variant. Consider prior anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2189-6-12**] the
premature atrial contractions are seen on the current tracing.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pleasant [**Age over 90 **] yo gentleman with CHF, DM Type II, HTN, diastolic
heart failure with preserved EF, admitted for elective pacemaker
placement, however requiring intubation and ICU admission for
hypercarbic respiratory failure, which was refractory.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Mr [**Known lastname 96908**] has known hx of
COPD and recent ICU hospitalization requiring intubation for
COPD flare.  On admission, pt had fluctuating O2 sats however nl
CXR and exam, was able to maintain sats in the 90s with
supplemental O2.  The morning after admission, pt was unable to
maintain sats >90 and was difficult to arouse, code blue called
and pt intubated on the floor and transferred to the ICU for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  He was extubated after a
couple days of mechanical ventilation, but afterwards he
continued to have tenuous respiratory status and difficulty
handling secretions.  He was He was optimally diuresed.  He
finished a course of antibiotics for pna.  Aspiration was a
consistent concern despite doing well on bedside swallow
studies, possibly compounded by fluxuating mental status.  A
video swallow was planned, but the evening before he developed
worsening hypercapneic respiratory failure and was intubated
again.  A CTA chest was negative for PE.  Upon conversations
with the family and the patient, it was clear that his
respiratory status would not improve to meet his goals for
standard of care and that his current respiratory status was
terminal given he did not wish to have a tracheostomy.  It was
decided to extubate him with goal to transition him to CMO and
hope to get him to the acute rehab associated with his [**Hospital 4382**], where his wife is.  [**Name2 (NI) **] was extubated on the morning of
[**7-12**].  Care was continued with the goal of comfort and meaningful
interaction with his family as long as possible. Medications
were started for respiratory comfort such as hyoscalamine and
morphine. He was able to enjoy a meaningful day, and got his
wish of having a [**Hospital1 778**] Frank and a drink of Crown [**Male First Name (un) 4542**], beofre
expiring peacefully at 9:24PM. Family was notified. A
post-mortem exam was declined.
