Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
Progressive worsening dysphagia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2168-5-4**]
Redo neck exploration; laparotomy with extensive
lysis of adhesions, harvesting of right and left colon,
substernal colonic interposition with cervical anastomosis,
colojejunostomy, ileocolostomy, and feeding jejunostomy.

[**2168-5-7**] Right pleural effusion with pigtail placement.

[**2168-5-13**] Tracheostomy #8 Portex cuffed nonfenestrated. Rigid
bronchoscopy and placement of covered tracheal metal stent, 20 x
40 mm, covering the fistula.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman who underwent a
transhiatal esophagectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2167-6-17**] for
esophageal cancer. Postoperatively he developed a severe
stricture involving the proximal 3 cm of his conduit. This
was dilated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a tracheoesophageal fistula
resulted. This ultimately healed with placement of endoscopic
stents but the patient had severe dysphagia and was unable to
tolerate saliva. The stricture was unable to be safely dilated
and after a lengthy discussion with the patient and family,
he was brought to the operating room today for substernal colon
interposition.

Chest xray [**2168-5-23**]:
right upper lobe consolidation as well as in right pleural
effusion and
bibasal atelectasis. The left PICC line tip is at the level of
mid SVC.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or mediastinal air present.
The pleural effusion at least partially loculated within the
fissure is redemonstrated.

[**2168-5-25**] Video Swallow
IMPRESSION:
Profound aspiration into the airway with minimal passage of
contrast into the esophagus. Because of these findings, it was
determined that standard barium esophagram to evaluate for
fistula would not be possible. With phonation, there appears to
be incomplete movement of the right vocal cord and no movement
of the left vocal cord.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82149**] was admitted on [**2168-5-3**] for bowel prep prior to his
planned colonic interposition. On [**2168-5-4**] the patient was taken
to the operating room where he underwent re-do neck exploration,
re-do laparotomy with harvesting of left colon and substernal
colon interposition. The patient was transfered to the SICU for
continued care. He was extubated on POD1; however, due to
respiratory distress and for airway protection, he was
reintubated that evening. He underwent a series of therapeutic
and diagnostic bronchoscopies ([**Date range (1) 22229**]). Bronchoscopies did
show a recurrent fistula that was stented in the operating room
on [**2168-5-13**]. Due to ventilator dependence, he was taken for a
tracheostomy on [**5-13**]. Please see the operative notes for
details. Patient was transferred to the general surgical floor
on [**2168-5-23**]. Please refer to following review of systems for brief
summary of his hospital course.

Neuro: Pain was initially controlled with epidural. While
intubated, propofol and fentanyl were used. Due to hypotension,
regimen switched to versed. Precedex used briefly for anxiolytic
wean which he did not tolerate. Patient improved with Ativan
for his agitation control. His epidural was removed on [**2168-5-8**].
On discharge, he was then maintained on a roxicet down his
j-tube for pain control. Patient with no neurological deficits
during this hospital course.

CV: History CHF. Volume status closely monitored. Fluid bolus
provided for hypotension and pressors avoided to perserve
conduit vascular flow. Lopressor resumed with hold parameters.
TTE on [**5-6**] showing EF 55% and normal RV function. He remained
HD stable for the rest of this hospitalization. He did receive
lasix for diuresis mid hospital course but appears euvolemic on
dishcharge.

Pulmonary: Patient resumed on his home nebulizer regimen.
Extubated POD1 but required re-intubation due to respiratory
distress. CXR showed worsening right sided infiltrates.
Bronchoscopy performed for lavage and cultures, which returned
Multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas. ID consulted for antibiotic
regimen and due to many allergies, started on aztreonam. CXR did
show an impressive R pleural effusion. Interventional pulmonary
performed a diagnostic thoracentesis, removing 500ml of
exudative fluid. A pigtail chest tube was then placed and
drained > 1500ml during his stay and was subsequently removed on
[**5-11**].

With failure to wean from ventilator, excessive airway
secretions and CXR findings, several bronchoscopies performed to
remove secretions, the patient required tracheostomy. Bilious
secretions were found in the airway, suggesting a re-occurence
of his tracheo-gastric fistula. With ventilator dependence and
respir
