Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, rash (?bactrim allergy), acute respiratory failure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 67yo M with CAD s/p CABG, DM, PVD, [**Hospital 16627**] transferred from
OSH with ARDS.
.
He initially presented to OSH w/ 3 days history of increasing
weakness and unable to situp and ambulate w/ his walker. He had
some dizziness and some neck pain but no photophobia. He also
had bitemporal headache an anorexia. H ealso had a couple
episode of vomiting but no diarrhea. He also had a
non-productive cough. He noted a fascicular and papular rash on
his bilateral hands, including his palms and trunk and
extremities.
.
Of note, he has chronic yeast infection in his groin. IN the ED,
he was hypotensive to the 80s w/ HR 62 but afebrile (on
b-blocker). He was very ill appearing and dry looking.
.
About 1 wk prior, he was started on bactrim by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
ulcer on both feet. He took a few days of bactrim but developed
severe diarrhea as a result of It. He stopped it. He was advised
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to resume bactrim b/c of concern of persistent
infection. Upon resuming bactrim, he developed a generalized
rash started initially over his face and spreading to his abd,
his upper and lower ext. The rash was not painful and no itchy.
It then began to itch subsequently.
.
Brief OSH course [**Date range (1) 16628**]:
He was admitted on [**8-29**] w/ profound weakness and worsening renal
fx w/ BUN 78 creat 2.5. Baseline BUN 30-40s. notable labs
initially
WBC 12K, Hct 32.7 Plt 203. 26% band, 2 % eos
Na 142 K 4.0 Bun 78 and creat 2.5. Gluc 159. AST 79, ALT 55, Alk
phos 84. INR 1.1.
EKG initially RBBB w/ non specific ST T wave changes w/ NSR at
62. CXR showed some bilateral patchy infiltrate.
AN LP was attempted in the ED for concern of disseminated
zoster.
.
He was sats 98 % on Ra and BP 98/43 and afebrile. He had an
extensive exfoliate rash on his upper and lower ext. Of note, he
was on bactrim for heel ulcer. He required hypotensive and
required IVF.
.
He was started on diflucan and acyclovir and CTX. Bld cx was
drawn and these have remained negative. One of the exfoliateive
lesion was unroofed and sent for culture. Derm [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 16629**] [**Last Name (un) **] and
di not believed that it was virla or herpetic and recommended
stopping acyclovir. (of note,  he had been given lasix as outpt
meds.). He was noted to be in increasing respiratory distress
1-2 days and was given additional dosage of lasix. (total 3
dosages of 40 IV lasix given on [**8-31**]). He was also seen by ID
who recommended stopping diflucan, acyclovir, CTA. Prednisone
was also started for presumed exfoliate dermatitis. Renal was
also consulted and felt that the rash is likely from bactrim and
sulfa related allergy. and recommended IVF hydration. Despite
attempted diuresis, he developed bilateral infiltrate (diffuse)
and increasing hypoxic respiratory failure. He was emergently
intubated after midnite [**8-31**]. He was sating low 90s w/ FiO2 100
and PEEP of 7.5. Central line was inserted and CVP was 16 w/ BNP
1020. Frothy pinkish secretions were obtained from his ETT
tubes. Cultures were sent.  Pt was started on ceftaz 1 q8 and
cipro 400 IV and 1 dose of 1gm vanco given empirically.  He was
also started on hydrocort 100 q8 on [**9-1**] AM.
.
Of note pt was recently admitted to the vascular [**Doctor First Name **] service
for L>R ulcer and was planned to have f/u surgery pending
cardiac evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2166-9-3**] hemodynamically stable, but with
ARDS for further management.  Pt was extubated on [**9-15**], but did
poorly on CPAP with trials of high flow ventilation.  He elected
to be DNR/DNI on [**9-16**] after extubation, and on [**9-24**] goals of
care where changed to comfort measures only.  Pt expired on [**9-25**]
from hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
.
# respiratory failure: the etiology of pt's ARDS unclear, but is
presumably [**12-26**] bactrim allergy which was being used to treat
?foot cellulitis.
.
Pt did have bandemia at OSH on arrival, but numerous cultures on
presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] and at OSH negative including blood,
sputum, BAL, urine, and foot wounds (left and right) were
negative.  On presentation to OSH pt noted to have rash of B LE
and it was thought that he had a bactrim allergy which he was
started on for foot ulcers.
.
Pt intubated at OSH on ~[**9-1**].  His respiratory mechanics
gradually improved with gentle diuresis with lasix gtt + diamox,
and pt was extubated [**9-15**], and transitioned to his home BiPaP
with PS 14/8.  After extubation, pt continued to have copious
secretions which improved slowly.  He also remained grossly
volume overloaded, and was tolerating only gentle diuresis
(~500-1000cc fluid removal daily), given his severe aortic
stenosis and preload dependence.  Pt gradually improved,
tolerating trial of high flow face mask ventilation, with O2
sats 95-100% on 8-15LPM. His secretions were improving on [**9-22**],
and less copious.
.
Blood and sputum cultures, though initially negative [**Hospital1 18**] (pt
previously on vanco/zosyn from OSH for unclear indication, abx
d/c'd [**9-14**]), subseqeuntly were positive for MRSA in blood and
sputum on [**9-17**].  Pt was begun on vanco/zosysn, and switched to
linezolid/meropenem for ?improved lung penetration.  however pt
continued to progress off of cpap, and on [**9-24**] decision was made
to change goals of care to CMO.   Pt expired on [**9-25**].
.
.
# sepsis - on [**9-19**] pt was noted to be hypothermic.  central
line and left a-line were removed earlier that day.  source
remained unclear, though ddx included [**Name (NI) 16630**] versus aline/LIJ
central line.  Blood Cx subsequently +mrsa.  SBPS remained
elevated, and pt was already being treated with a second course
of vanco/zosyn, which was continued.  lactate level was
unremarkable.  By [**9-22**], pt was afebrile for 48hrs, and without
hypotension.  his UOP, however remained, low, and given his
failure to improve from a respiratory standpoint, pt elected to
change goals of care to CMO on [**9-24**] and expired on [**9-25**].
.
.
# CV: pt with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2158**], last Cath [**6-28**]. This
admission pt with cardiac enzymes x 3 w/ + trop but negative CKs
and these trended down.  Thought to be due to demand ischemia
with hypotension.  Pt's plavix was d/c'd as pt is >1.5 yrs s/p
cath and has had had guaic pos stools.  Aspirin dose decreased
to 81 mg po qdaily, and held pending restarting oral feeding.
On [**9-24**] pt complained of CP, however no new EKG changes were
noted, cardiac enzymes unremarkable compared to prior bump, and
CP resol
