Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 65 year old female with past medical history
significant for diastolic heart failure, moderate aortic
stenosis with valve area of [**2-3**].2 cm2, bronchietasis and COPD
with stage II gold criteria and home oxygen 2-4L who was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2197-12-23**] - [**2198-1-2**] for
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation and
improvement with aggressive diuresis and treatment for hospital
acquired pneumonia/COPD exacerbation with prednisone and
Vancomycin/meropenem/azithromycin.
.
She was reports doing well at home since coming back from rehab
in [**2198-1-3**]. She reports being compliant with her diuretics
and diet with low salt. She does report occassional canned food
intake. She was noted to have diarrhea two days ago with
productive [**Year (4 digits) **] (different from her usual [**Year (4 digits) **]), shortness of
breath, hand tremors and occassional pleuritic left chest wall
pain yesterday. She reports her only sick contact is her
daughter who also had diarrhea but no pulmonary symptoms. She
was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation of her shortness of
breath.
.
In the ED, her vitals were 97.0 122 145/106 100%6LNC. She was
noted to be tachypneic and oxygen saturation of 80% on home
oxygen. She was placed on CPAP with improvement in her
oxygenation. Her chest x-ray was concerning for new right lower
infiltrate. She was given solumedrol, ceftriaxone and levaquin
after blood and urine culture were drawn for presumed pneumonia.
She was not given IV lasix in the ED. She was transferred to
MICU for futher evaluation and management.
.
In the MICU, patient reported feeling better and less short of
breath.

Past Medical History:
- Asthma: (since childhood)/COPD s/p multiple intubations: 2L NC

(since [**2172**]) at baseline for spO2 91-95%, last PFT ~1 yr ago
at OSH, trach previously suggested but pt refused
- OSA: sleep study in [**2187**], recommended CPAP but has not
tolerated it well, unclear how compliant since last discharge
(made some progress on the fit of the mask). Of note, overnight
oximetry "better than expected" when measured at rehab.
- GERD
- Anemia (history of GI bleeding)
- Leukopenia, long standing, unclear etiology
- Hyperglycemia when previously on prednisone
- Diastolic heart failure, LVEF > 55%, [**8-/2197**]
- Aortic stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2 cm^2)
- Moderate pulmonary HTN, PCWP > 18
- Atrial fibrillation (on dilt +/- beta blocker), no
anticoagulation due to history of GI bleeding

Social History:
-Smoking/Tobacco: quit smoking in [**2172**] (20 pack years)
-EtOH: None
-Illicits: None
-Lives at/with: sister (a nurse) in [**Name (NI) 4628**], was in rehab until

[**12-4**]; has 3 children, 1 died @ 27 in [**4-/2197**] from asthma
complication, has a daughter who's a CNA.
-Retired manager of a medical answering services

STUDIES:
[**2198-3-9**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse baseline artifact with uninterpretable ST-T waves in
leads V1-V3. Rightward axis. Non-specific diffuse ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2197-12-24**] the
ventricular response is faster. Otherwise, the findings are
similar.

[**2198-3-9**] CXR: Lower lung consolidations concerning for pneumonia,
possible small effusions. Please note technical limitations and
if needed a repeat with more optimized technique may be
performed to more clearly assess.

[**2198-3-13**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**3-12**], there are lower
lung volumes. No change in the appearance of the right PICC
line. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with mild
engorgement of pulmonary vessels that has improved since the
prior study.

Opacification at the left base again suggests volume loss or
superimposed
consolidation. The possibility of a central obstructing lesion
must again be considered. Prominence of central pulmonary
vessels again could reflect
pulmonary artery hypertension.
