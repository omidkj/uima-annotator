Chief Complaint:
Severe diffuse tracheobronchomalacia.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 42611**] is a 57 y/o, female with severe TBM with previous
silicone-Y-stent and tracheostomny tube that resulted in
symptomatic improvement but the patient was hesitant to undergo
a TBP at that time. She developed another episode of respiratory
failure with septic shock 2 months ago in the setting of
pneumonia which required another silicone-Y-stent and
tracheostomy tube and then later on, had the silicone-Y-stent
removed secondary to granulation tissue. The patient was
discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehab where she was weaned off
mechanical ventilation and has been tolerating continuous red
capping for the last few weeks. She has been participating in
physical therapy and reports being "active" while she denies any
dyspnea, chest pain, neck pain, cough, hemoptysis, wheezing,
feve, chills, night sweats. She has been tolerating oral feeding
and denies any dysphagia.   She is being admitted following her
trachealplasty.

CXR:
[**2169-7-18**] FINDINGS: The tracheostomy tip is 4 cm above the
carina. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal. The
mediastinal contours appear mildly widened but unchanged from
prior study. The lung volumes are low. Bibasilar opacities may
represent atelectasis, although underlying infectious process
cannot be ruled out. Blunting of the costophrenic angles
bilaterally is consistent with small pleural effusions. A coiled
tube projecting over the epigastrium is most consistent with a
percutaneous feeding tube. The osseous structures demonstrate
mild scoliosis.
[**2169-7-17**]: continued low lung volumes with some elevation of the
right hemidiaphragmatic contour. Although
bibasilar opacifications persist, there appears to be some
increased aeration on the left. This most likely represents some
effusion and atelectasis, though superimposed pneumonia must be
considered if there are appropriate clinical symptoms.
[**2169-7-13**]: : In comparison with the study of [**7-13**], there are
continued low lung volumes in a patient with tracheostomy tube.
Bibasilar opacification is consistent with atelectasis and
effusions. In the appropriate clinical
setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia could not be
excluded.
[**2169-7-7**]: Right basal chest tube is in place. There is no
evident pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar
opacities are likely atelectases, right greater than left. There
is mild right subcutaneous emphysema. Tracheostomy tube is in
standard position. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by lung
abnormality. Catheter projects over the upper abdomen.






Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 42611**] was admitted to the Thoracic surgery service at [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**2169-7-7**] after she was taken to the operating room on [**2169-7-7**]
for tracheoplasty by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative
report for full details. She remained ventilated with Trach mask
trials until [**2169-7-17**] when she tolerated Trach mask x 24 hours
with oxygen saturations stable at 93-95% on 50% humidified
oxygen.

Neuro: Awake alert with episodes of anxiety which responded to
Seroquel.

Pulmonary: The patient required aggressive pulmonary toilet,
mucolytic nebs, chest PT and ambulation. She continued to do
well on Trach collar. Her Trach was downsized to a 6.0 Portex
w/o inner cannula, cuff (deflated) from #7 [**Last Name (un) 295**].  She
tolerated this well.  Oxygen saturations with 50% humidified air
were 93-95%.

CV: The patient was maintained on TID diltiazem in SR 80-90.
Hemodynamic stable with blood pressures 110-140.

GI: Her bowel function returned with bowel regime in place.

Nutrition: She was seen by nutrition who recommended Replete
with fiber to a Goal of 70 mL/hr.  Strict NPO.  Sit upright when
receiving tube feeds.

Speech: She was seen by Speech for PMV evaluation initially but
was unable to tolerate [**2-14**] edema.  Repeat swallow evaluation on
[**2169-7-18**] her oxygen saturations decreased. Vocal quality is
strained likely [**2-14**] irritation and swelling, but she can wear it
for trials throughout the day. Her vocal quality is improved
with
cues to "have an easy onset" to speech.She was taken for a
video-swallow on [**2169-7-19**] which showed aspiration. She should
remain NPO including all medications.  Initiate swallow therapy
to improve oral and pharyngeal strength.

Renal: renal function within normal range with good urine
output. Electrolytes were replete as needed.

ID: Bronchoscopy x 2 for mucus plug with BAL GNR consistent with
normal flora. She completed a 7 Day course of Levofloxacin.

Heme: HCT stable at baseline 26.0-30.  Anticoagulation was not
restarted since she completed her treatment for Right cephalic
thrombus.

Endocrine: blood sugars were 88-140's requiring occasional
insulin sliding scale coverage immediately postoperatively.

Pain: Epidural Bupivacaine and Dilaudid was managed by the Acute
pain service, once removed she was converted to PO pain
medications via PEG, and Lidocaine patch placed on either side
of the right thoracotomy site.

Disposition: She was followed by physical therapy.  She continue
to make steady progress but continued need for aggressive
physical and speech therapy is required.
She was discharged to [**Hospital1 700**] in [**Location (un) 701**]
[**2169-7-19**].
