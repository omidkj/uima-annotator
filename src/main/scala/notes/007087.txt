CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2129-9-24**] 8:35 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o chf

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old woman with hypotension, low ef
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o chf
HISTORY: Hypotension. Low ejection fraction.

PORTABLE AP CHEST, 1 VIEW:

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to [**2129-3-27**]. The patient is status
post sternotomy. There is a left-sided pacemaker with lead tips
in the region of the RA and RV. There is a prosthetic mitral
valve. The heart is enlarged with slight increase in size
compared to the prior exam. There is new vascular congestion and
indistinctness consistent with CHF, although there is no
interstitial or alveolar edema. There are no large pleural
effusions and there are no focal areas of consolidation.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with CHF.

ECHO:
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Emergency
study performed by the cardiology fellow on call.

Conclusions:
The left ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is severely depressed. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right
ventricular free wall motion appears grossly preserved. The
aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
A bileaflet
mitral valve prosthesis is present and appears well-seated.
Leaflet motion is
probably preserved (views suboptimal). Mitral regurgitation is
present but
cannot be quantified. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened with
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared to the prior study of [**2129-9-8**], the basal septum now
appears
slightly less vigorous; overall left ventricular systolic
function appears
slightly more depressed. Peak transmitral velocity appears
similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Septic shock: the patient had GNR bacterima likely from PICC
line. She was placed on Zosyn and Levo and continued Levo as an
outpatient. She was weaned off the Levophed and her dopamine was
dropped down to her home infusion dose. Her PICC line was
changed.

2. CHF excerbation: The patient has end-stage CHF and is on home
dopamine infusion. A bedside echo showed EF 20 - 25 % and no
effusion. She was diuresed 8lbs overweight with Lasix.

3. Mechanical valve: Her coumadin was brefily held when she was
admiited for a INR 3.3. This was restarted prior to DC.

4. ARF: Cr 3.5 from baseline of 1.2 most likely from
hypoperfusion.  This resolved with correction of her failure and
hypotension.

5. CAD: Her ASA and ACEI were titrated up. She was ruled out for
an MI

6. Hyperkalemia: Got kayexalate in the ED. Resolved
