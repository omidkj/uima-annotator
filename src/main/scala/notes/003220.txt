LUNGS: CTABL, No crackles or wheezing
ABDOMEN: Soft ND/NT +BS
EXT: Large left thigh mass encircling anterior left leg which is
warm and tender. L PICC with dressing over line no evidence of
oozing, L femoral line in place-no oozing, no peripheral edema;
R chest area without open wound, no purulent discharge currently

NEURO: A/O X3, no focal deficits, strength 4/5 throughout, no
tremors.

Pertinent Results:
.
CXR [**8-20**]: IMPRESSION: Diffuse airspace process, new since [**7-25**],
and most likely representing pulmonary edema; extensive
aspiration pneumonitis is a more remote consideration.
.
CT HEAD noncontrast [**8-21**]: IMPRESSION: Stable head CT examination
demonstrating chronic microvascular ischemic changes as above.
.
CT ABDOMEN, CHEST, PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2125-8-24**] 1:31 PM
1.  No evidence of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal bleeding.
2.  Grossly unchanged appearance of large left groin hematoma,
which contains layering fluid-fluid levels suggestive of
hematocrit effect, likely reflective of recent bleeding.
3.  New smaller right groin hematoma.
4.  Moderate hiatal hernia.
5.  Multiple sub 5-mm noncalcified pulmonary nodules.  Followup
chest CT recommended in [**6-19**] months' time.
.
CHEST U.S. RIGHT Study Date of [**2125-8-28**] 3:54 PM
Right chest wall collection with apparently artificial tram
tracking tubular structure that likely represents foreign body.
.
SHOULDER [**2-10**] VIEWS NON  Study Date of [**2125-8-29**] 5:49 PM There are
areas of sclerosis and lucency in the femoral head, probably
related to the previously seen osteoarthritic changes.  If there
is strong clinical suspicion of septic arthritis, joint
aspiration may be of use.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Mental Status changes: per OMR notes, pt with h/o delirium in
setting of infectious process, however, was oriented during MICU
stay and upon transfer to the floor.  Was intermittently
somnolent without clear etiology - all electrolytes, glucose
levels, O2 saturations WNL, which was likely related to poor
sleep during stay.  Continued to be oriented upon return to
floor.  On day of discharge was alert and oriented, without
concern for mental status changes.
.
# HTN - Blood pressure was initially low in the MICU secondary
to acute blood loss.  Upon transfer to the floor he was
restarted on his home dosing of metoprolol  initially poorly
controlled upon admit to the floor.  Started on metoprolol 25mg
po TID in MICU.  Now on Metoprolol 100mg po TID, lisinopril 40mg
and Norvasc 10mg with much improvement.  Was monitored
throughout stay and discharged on this regimen.
- Discharged on ACE, BB and CCB dosing, monitor.
.
# Gram + bacteremia- Was called to return to the hospital once
return of positive blood culture growing coag (-) staph on
[**2125-8-22**].  Being treated with vancomycin on HD protocol since
with good effect.   Original source of infection remains unclear
- HD catheter, thigh hematoma, or right chest wall wound with
known foreign body.  Additionally there were concerning changes
on prior spinal imaging, however pt refused MRI to assess for
osteomyelitis.  He continually denied tenderness in low back on
exam.  Infectious disease, renal and transplant surgery were
consulted and helped facilitate therapy.  TTE to evaluate for
endocarditis was inconclusive, however TEE was not persued given
it would not change the duration of recommended therapy.
Ultimately the chest wall foreign body was removed by transplant
surgery.  Wound consult was obtained and followed his chest
wound throughout his stay.  Following this, a new HD catheter
was placed by Interventional Radiology as requested by Renal
given that he has a history of access problems.  Infectious
disease recommended 6 weeks of Vancomycin therapy and he was
discharged on this medication.
- Vanc per HD protocol for 6 weeks per HD protocol, check vanco
level at HD
.
# Right chest wall wound - Discovered on admission with open,
nonpurulent drainage.  Ultrasound evaluation of the area
revealed a foreign body consistent with prior wick or catheter
remnant.  Transplant surgery was consulted and and attempted to
remove the foreign body while inpatient without complication.
He was followed by Transplant surgery throughout his stay. He
should have dressing changed daily and packed with [**Last Name (un)
