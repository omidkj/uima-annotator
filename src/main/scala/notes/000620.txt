History of Present Illness:
71 yom w history of CLL, ESRD on HD (MWF), on home oxygen (2L
NC), now presenting with a fever and SOB. According to the
patient, he was in his usual state of good health until
yesterday after dialysis. He completed his dialysis session
(removed 3L), and felt SOB upon going home. This persisted
through the evening so his sister decided to bring him to the
[**Name (NI) **]. According to his sister, he as feeling increasingly short of
breath for the past couple of days.
He denies recent, fevers, chills, sick contacts, myalgias, chest
pain, diarrhea, dysuria (still produces some urine), headaches,
neck stiffness, cough, sputum production.

He presented to an outside hospital where he was given
vancomycin and (?) gentamycin. He was then transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for further treatment and evaluation.
Initial VS in ED: 99.8 102 90/50 28 96% 3L nc
Labs notable for WBC of 44.1, HCT of 31.4 and Plt of 59.
Creatinine was 3.4. Lactate of 1.2. CXR showed compared to
[**1-/2168**] left lower lobe opacity concerning for consolidation +/-
effusion. He was given levaquin.
In the ED, the patient received roughly 1 L NS with a good
response in his BP (increased transiently to 100-110s). His
blood pressure, however, subsequently decreased to mid 90s so he
was admitted to the MICU. He also spiked a temperature to 101.
On arrival to the MICU, he complains of some pain in LLQ, which
he says he "always gets after dialysis". Feels SOB, but no other
complaints.
VS on arrival: 103 106 98/56 31 96 on 4L NC

IMAGING:
CXR [**2168-8-25**]
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema and large left sided pleural
effusion in the
setting of chronic left lower lobe collapse and central
lymphadenopathy.

ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic
function appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection
fraction approximately 30 percent). However, there is
considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2165-10-29**], significant right ventricular and left
ventricular contractile dysfunction is now present.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yom with multiple medical problems including DM2, ESRD on HD,
b/l BKAs who presents with SOB, fever, respiratory failure.
PLAN:

# SEPSIS: Pt was admitted with acute respiratory failure and met
SIRS criteria. He was intubated soon after admission to MICU for
hypoxia. CXR was consistent with PNA. Both blood cultures and
urine cultures demonstrated E.coli. He was started on meropenem
and double covered with amikacin. He was also started on
vancomycin. He required 4 vasopressors to maintain adequate
blood pressures within first 24hrs of admission. An aterial line
and central venous line were placed. Family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
confirmed his DNR status. Pt's BP continued to drop despite
maximal amounts of vasopressors. He became bradycardic and
expired on the evening of [**2168-8-26**].

# CAD: Denies chest pain at the moment. [**Name2 (NI) **] metoprolol (given
hypotension) and aspirin (given thrombocytopenia).

# CLL: Pt pancytopenia with appears near baseline, however his
diff reveals promyelocytes and I am wondering if he has
converted to AML. Heme/Onc did not think this was a blast
crisis.

# ESRD: Completed dialysis yesterday. Electrolytes wnl. Will
need to make HD/renal aware. Renal was consulted. Monitor lytes.


# DM2: Holding insulin for now.

# HTN: Holding home meds.
