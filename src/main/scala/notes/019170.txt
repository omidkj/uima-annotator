end colostomy

History of Present Illness:
87 yoM w/ a h/o CAD, HTN, DM presents with shortness of breath x
1 day, shortness of breath was at rest. Over the past two days
he has noted epigastric discomfort with exertion, while on the
treadmill he feels this discomfort after 2-4 minutes, he then

pillow orthopnea, slightly worsening pedal edema over past 5
days but has been present for 4-5 years in total. No
claudication symptoms. Syncope 5 weeks ago, seen at [**Hospital3 **] with no clear diagnosis.

In the ED the patient was started on BiPAP and given vanc /
zosyn / levofloxacin given the leukocytosis, started on a nitro
drip and 2 uPRBC. In addition given lasix 40mg IV x 2 and was
started on a PPI drip. (at [**Hospital3 **] also got lasix 80-120mg
IV x 1) and aspirin 325mg x 1.

[**1-16**].
GENERAL: NAD, AOX3
HEENT: JVP of 12cm but obscured by mask

murmur @ USB, [**3-14**] HSM at apex
LUNGS: Dullness at L base, rales [**3-11**] way up bilaterally
symmetrical

Pertinent Results:
Imaging Studies:
CXR: [**12-4**] - Acute CHF

CXR [**2181-12-26**]- FINDINGS: Status post reposition of the
nasogastric tube. The tube is now in correct position. All other
monitoring and support devices are also unremarkable. The
transparency of the lung parenchyma is increased as compared to
the previous examination.

Abdominal U/S: [**12-6**] -
IMPRESSION: Mildly heterogeneous echogenic liver, which may be
compatible
with fatty infiltration. Please note, other forms of liver
disease and more advanced liver disease such as hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this
examination.

LENIs: [**2181-12-8**]: No DVTs

Head CT: [**2181-12-12**] - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Head CT: [**2181-12-27**] - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial
abnormality.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis: [**2181-12-13**]
IMPRESSION: 1. Severe predominalty distal colitis, with some
relative preservation of the proximal colon. 2. Questionable
incomplete small-bowel obstruction, or ileus. 3. Eccentric
dilatation of the portions of the sigmoid and descending colon
(locations given above), which might suggest small
self-contained perforation or large diverticulum. 4. Trace of
ascites. 5. Bilateral pleural effusion with some adjacent small
basilar atelectasis, and evidence of prior asbestos exposure. 6.
No free air in the peritoneal cavity. Air in the abdominal wall
in the subcutanous tissue anteriorly. We recommend to repeat CT
abdomen, to follow oral contrast distribution and to further
evaluate items 2 and 3.

Follow-up CT Abdomen/Pelvis: [**2181-12-14**]
1. Focus of eccentric dilatation of descending colon, in the
left lower
quadrant, with asymmetrical distribution of contrast and air and
significant fat tissue stranding, which either represents acute
diverticulitis or perforation realted to colitis. There is
currently no evidence of freee intraperitoneal spillage or air.
Surgical consult is recommended. Results were discussed with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  2. Second eccentric dilatation, which might be
site of giant sigmoid diverticulum.No inflammation is seen
around this and while contrast is seen within it it does not
appear to represent an acute finding. 3. There is no small-bowel
obstruction, the dilated loops of the small bowel are likely due
to ileus. 4. Severe pancolitis-relative sparing proximally. 5.
Bilateral pleural effusion with some adjacent small basilar
atelectasis, and evidence of prior asbestos exposure. Results
were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical consult was
recommended. Results were also discussed with the surgical
resident.

KUB: [**2181-12-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of free air under the right hemidiaphragm.
2. Progressive dilatation of multiple loops of small bowel.
Review of notes in OMR demonstrate these findings were known to
hte treating physicians, and that the patient has already been
taken to surgery.

Microbiology Review:
All blood cultures [**Date range (1) 79766**] (7 cultures) negative for growth
to date
All urine cultures: negative for growth to date, last on [**12-27**]
showed limited yeast.
joint fluid: PMNs on gram stain, no organisms seen

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: This is an 87 yo M with multiple risk factors
for CAD s/p NSTEMI [**3-10**] demand ischemia from an acute GIB whose
hospital course was complicated by a C. difficile infection and
colonic perforation. Patient underwent an exp-lap with L
colectomy, end colostomy, and [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch. He was
transferred back to cardiology floor 8 days after surgery for
management of volume overload, delerium, and acute on chronic
renal failure. The patient was treated for all of these medical
issues and was discharged to rehabilitation.

#. NSTEMI: Patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery
disease including HTN, HLD, and PVD. However, his NSTEMI was
thought to be due to demand ischemia from his GI bleed. Because
of his multiple risk factors and hemodynamic instability from
the bleed, he was not considered a candidate for cardiac
catherization. He was medically managed with an aspirin, beta
blocker, and statin. ACE inhibitor was held in setting of his
renal failure and can be restarted as an outpatient. Troponins
were stable and EKG without acute ischemic changes on discharge.

#. GI bleed: Patient had melanotic stools and hematocrit drop.
GI was consulted for endoscopy, but the etiology of his GI bleed
(upper versus lower) was unclear as patient was deemed a high
risk candidate and never underwent endoscopy. [**Month (only) 116**] have had some
component of mesenteric ischemia, given his PVD, which
contributed to his colonic perforation. Patient had appropriate
access, hematocrit was monitored q6-q8H, and patient was
transfused with 6 [**Location **] throughout his hospital stay.
Continued on high dose proton pump inhibitor. His hematocrit
stabilized in the high 20s. He should have an upper endoscopy as
an outpatient to assess for etiologies of his GIB after
discharge/rehabiliation (this has been scheduled at [**Hospital1 18**] in
[**Month (only) 1096
