fevers

percutaneous transhepatic catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
84yo female w/ HTN and recent SBO admitted with one week of
high-grade fevers. She went to see her PCP today with 6 days of
fevers to 102-103 despite taking Tylenol at home. She has not
had any cough, congestion, abdominal pain, change in bowel
movements or dysuria. She had had no change in appetite, but had
stopped her Synthroid and antihypertensives. She has not had any
procedures except for dental cleaning one month ago. She has no
sick contacts. The decision was made to check basic labs and
blood cultures and have her go home. After returning home, she
had worsening weakness, began having dry heaves, and seemed
confused to her son, so she came into the [**Name (NI) **].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 102.9 110 119/63 46 95%. Labs were
notable for elevated LFTs, WBC 9.5 with 16% bands, Cr 1.3 from
baseline 0.8 to 1. Patient was given 4.2L IVF, vanc/zosyn. Her
pressures trended down to SBP 80, so a R IJ was placed and she
was started on Levophed. She had one episode of diarrhea. An
abdominal U/S showed a large liver mass, new from prior,
concerning for liver abscess vs malignancy. After all the
fluids, began having tachypnea and wheezing, but improved with
albuterol.Vitals prior to transfer were 110/50 73 97%2L 23 on
0.12mcg of levophed.
.
On the floor, patient is feeling tired but is alert and
oriented. She denies abdominal pain. All other ROS negative.

AP CXR: low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities similar to
prior. Increased heart size.
.
RUQ U/S:
1. New 7.1 cm lesion in the right lobe of the liver,
predominantly hypoechoic with echogenic rim. Diff dx includes
necrotic tumor/met, infectious processs vs recent surgery;
correlate with symptoms. Additional imaging such as an MRI may
be obtained for further evaluation.
2. Gallbladder wall edema with wall thickness measuring 6mm and
with trace adjacent free fluid. Gall bladder is not distended,
however findings are concerning for acute cholecystitis in the
correct clinical setting.
.
EKG: sinus rhythm at 94bpm w/ prolonged PR. Normal axis, no ST
changes. Unchanged from 10/[**2149**].
.
CT abdomen [**11-24**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Arterial enhancing hepatic abscess in segment VII of the
liver. This
lesion is amenable to image-guided drainage.
2. Gallbladder wall thickening, which may be compatible with
cholangitis in the correct clinical context. No gallbladder or
bile duct stones.
3. Diffuse colonic diverticula without evidence of
diverticulitis. A CT scan of the pelvis should be obtained to
exclude diverticulitis which may have seated hepatic abscess.

CT Pelvis [**11-24**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
2. Lobulated cystic right ovarian lesion, stable since [**Month (only) **]
[**2151**],
slightly increased since [**2148**]. Evaluation with ultrasound could
be performed if clinically indicated.

Echo: [**2151-11-30**]
The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetation or abscess seen. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Trace aortic regurgitation

Brief Hospital Course:
84yo female w/ HTN and recent SBO admitted with one week of
high-grade fevers and a new 7cm liver lesion.

1. Septic shock: Patient admitted with septic shock secondary to
polymicrobial bactermia with liver abscess.  She underwent
initial early goal directed therapy with 4L IV fluid, right IJ
placement with initiation of levophed, and broad spectrum
antibiotics with Vanc/Zosyn. CT abdomen/pelvis was done, showing
an abscess amenable for U/S-guided drainage. IR placed
transcutaneous transhepatic catheter with drainage of purulent
fluid.  The CT scan did not show any diverticulitis or other
potential source for bacteremia. Despite some mild gall bladder
thickening, the surgery team did not feel that there was
cholecystitis. CEA and alpha-fetoprotein were normal.  TTE
showed no evidence of endocarditis as source of infection.
Following drain placement, septic physiology resolved and
patient was able to wean off pressors.  Patient became afebrile,
leukocytosis resolved and LFTs slowly normalized.  Purulent
fluid from liver abscess grew fusobacterium and blood cultures
returned with strep anginosus and fusobacterium.  Vancomycin/
zosyn was tailored to zosyn and then to ertapenem on discharge.
Picc line was placed once patient was afebrile for > 24 hrs and
blood cultures were negative.

Patient will need 4 weeks of ertapenem ([**2151-12-1**] - [**2151-12-30**])
with weekly monitoring of CBC, BMP
