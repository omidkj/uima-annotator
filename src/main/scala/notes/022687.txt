Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient 81 yo male with history of ILD now with worening
SOB. Over the past month, the patient has had worsening
shortness of breath/cough with increasing O2 requirement. He was
started on steroids in mid-[**Month (only) **] in an attempt to halt his
IPF. He reports minimal effects. Approxmately 2 weeks ago, he
presented with what sounded like a sinusititis with copious
nasal secretions (no fevers, chills, tooth pain) which improved
with a 5 day course of azithromycin. However shortly after
stopping the Z-pack he began to experience a sensation of phlegm
in the basck of his throat, which when he coughs up is yellow in
color (no hemoptysis). He denied fevers, chills, rhinorrhea. He
states that the sputum is worse at night especially when he lays
down and is relived by expectorating as well as sitting up
right. He denies any pleuritic chest pain. He then began
experienceing worsening fatigue and malaise over the past week.
He was seen in pulmonary clinic this morning and there was
concerning about superimposed pneumonia and he was sent to the
ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T97.0 HR 88 BP142/69 O2 91% 6L. A
CT Chest was performed and showed new superimposed diffuse
ground-glass densities of both lungs. He received 1g IV
ceftriaxone and 500mg IV Azithromycin. At times he desaturated
to the 70's during coughing fits. He was admitted to the ICU for
further management.

2. Hypertension
3. Allergies
4. GERD

6. Anemia


Social History:

smoking history. Retired chemical engineer.

Physical Exam:
Vitals - 97.7 77 132/71 22 100% on 80%HiFlow mask
General - older male, lying in male, able to speak in broken
sentences
HEENT - PERRL
CV - RRR
Lungs - crackles on left [**3-13**] way up; crackles at base on right
Abdomen - soft, NT/ND
Ext - no edema


Pertinent Results:
[**2191-2-17**] CT Chest - 1. New superimposed diffuse ground-glass
densities of both lungs which is most likely concerning for an
atypical infection. The Pneumocystis jirovecii infection is also
a possibility. Superimposed hypersensitivity pneumonitis and
drug reaction are another likely possibilities. Superimposed
acute
interstitial pneumonia such as NSIP also cannot be excluded.
2. Interval worsening of the patient's known interstitial lung
disease with worsening of the bronchiectatic changes of both
lungs and worsening of honeycombing, it was suggested that the
patient's underlying ILD was most likely asbestosis.
[**2191-2-17**] CXR - 1. Stable interstitial lung disease. 2.Subtle
increased opacity in the right cardiophrenic region, could
represent early/developing infiltrate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 81 yo M with IPF now with worsening SOB and
increaseing O2 requirement.
.
# SOB: patient with severe underlying IPF, now with likely
underlying infection.  Initially treated for community acquired
pneumonia and underwent BAL to eval for possible PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6643**] was
negative.  He was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin and
improved gradually.  He had a low grade temperature and repeat
sputum culture revealed MRSA, given his tenuous respiratory
status, he was started on vancomycin initially and switched to
linezolid afterwards.  Plan is for 14 day course of linezolid.
For the communitya acquired pneumonia, he was switched to
levofloxacin at the time of discharge to finish a 14 day course.
 He also received cough suppresants, oxygen and nebs prn.  At
day of discharge he was on 95% on RA and needed oxygen with only
exertion.
.
# hyponatremia: Patient has chronic hyponatremia.  Etiology
unknown.  Urine lytes revealed SIADH, so he was fluid restricted
to 1500cc.  There has been a concern for norvasc as contributing
in the past and this was discontinued.  His na improved likely
from withholding free water (unclear role of norvasc withdrawl,
as both were done concurrently).
.
# IPF - followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]; treat underlying infection,
followed by pulmonary in house.  He was increased on prednisone
during this infection which was tapered down.  Please continue
on 10 mg prednisone until [**2191-3-7**], then switch to 5mg daily
until pt follows up with pulmonary.
.
# Hypertension - continue outpatient meds initially.  Norvasc
was discontinued and his BP remained stable.
.
# Narcolepsy: cont provigil
