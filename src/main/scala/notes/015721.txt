Admission Date:  [**2196-5-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2196-6-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2121-4-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year-old
female with a history of hypothyroidism who presents on the
morning of admission with complaints of chest pain and
dizziness.  After waking up the patient had two episodes of
dizziness and fell after the first episode.  She also had
experienced left arm pain, which was not related to her fall.
The visiting nurse arrived in the morning to find the patient
lethargic and confused and called EMS.  On arrival the
patient was noted to have no palpable pulses heart rate in
the 20s and found to be in complete heart block.  She was
started on Atropine and taken to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital
where she was noted to be bradycardic in the 50s with
inferior ST elevations on electrocardiogram.  The patient was
also thought to be in respiratory distress with hypotension
and therefore was intubated and started on a Dopamine drip.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for further management.

On arrival the patient was bradycardic in the 50s and she was
taken immediately to coronary catheterization, which
demonstrated a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary
artery and a 60 to 70% mid left anterior descending coronary
artery lesion.  The right coronary artery lesion was treated
with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
distal protection, then stented with timi three flow.  She
had a temporary pacer wire placed during the catheterization,
but this was discontinued and the patient was brought to the
Coronary Care Unit for further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroidism.
2.  Chronic lymph edema.
3.  History of necrotizing fasciitis status post skin graft.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin.
2.  Cephalosporins.
3.  Fluoroquinolone.
4.  Bactrim.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Synthroid 150 micrograms po q.d.
2.  Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a heart
rate of 64, blood pressure 160/65 and a respiratory rate of
14.  She was intubated and sedated.  Pupils are equal, round
and reactive to light.  Sclera anicteric.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally on anterior examination.  Cardiac
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen was soft and nondistended.  There
was trace lower extremity edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY STUDIES AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White blood cell
count of 17.7 with a hematocrit of 40 and 321,000 platelets.
Panel 7 was significant for a BUN of 19 and creatinine 1.6.
Initial cardiac enzymes demonstrated a CK of 80, MB of 10.7,
and troponin I of 1.24.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia at 50 beats per minute with left axis deviation
and right bundle branch block as well as prolonged PR
interval.  There were Q waves noted in leads 3 and AVF with [**Street Address(2) 12501**] elevations in leads 3, AVF and 2.  Also noted were 1 to
[**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in leads V1 through V4 on a right sided
electrocardiogram with ST depressions in lead AVL.  All of
these changes were new compared to baseline
electrocardiogram.  Coronary catheterization demonstrated two
vessel disease as mentioned previously with a totally
occluded right coronary artery and a 60% mid left anterior
descending coronary artery stenosis.  Right heart
catheterization revealed a right atrial pressure of 16, right
ventricle pressures of 31/11, PA pressures of 29/15, and a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Myocardial infarction:  The patient
suffered an inferior wall myocardial infarction with RV
infarct physiology requiring fluid resuscitation.  She was
aggressively hydrated with normal saline and required both
temporary pacing as well as Dopamine to maintain her blood
pressures.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was floated through a right
internal jugular access to help assess fluid status as well
as hemodynamics.  Of note, hemodynamic measurements suggested
an anomalous pulmonary venous return to the SVC due to
elevated SVC saturations, which made the FIC calculation
inaccurate.  The patient remained dependent on fluids, pacing
and Dopamine for several days, but was finally weaned off
Dopamine and extubated six days post infarct.  She was
treated with aspirin, Plavix and Atorvastatin, but beta
blockers and ace inhibitors were held due to hypotension
during the peri infarct time.  The patient had no further
episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath and her
coronary disease should be evaluated as an outpatient with an
exercise stress test with imaging to assess whether she
should undergo cardiac catheterization for the left anterior
descending coronary artery lesion.  Transthoracic
echocardiogram on [**2196-6-3**] demonstrated a left ventricular
systolic ejection fraction greater then 55% with normal wall
thickness and cavity size.  The right ventricle size was
normal with depressed left ventricular systolic function.
Following extubation and recovery of right ventricular
function the patient maintained her blood pressures without
need of pacing or pressors, and autodiuresed.

2.  Infectious disease:  While intubated, the patient had
purulent discharge exuding from her nasopharynx.  She did not
develop a fever, but had elevations in her white blood cell
count up to the [**Numeric Identifier 7206**] range, and was therefore started on
Vancomycin and Aztreonam to cover possible nosocomial
infections.  Thermo dilution methods suggested a low SVR and
hypotension suggesting possible sepsis, but after continuing
her antibiotics for several days her white count normalized
and she maintained good blood pressures.  She is to complete
a ten day course of Vancomycin and Aztreonam for suspected
sinusitis.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition to rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute myocardial infarction.
2.  Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the right
coronary artery with 60% mid left anterior descending
coronary artery stenosis.
3.  Anomalous pulmonary venous return to SVC.
4.  Sinusitis.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Chronic lymph edema.
7.  History of necrotizing fasciitis status post skin graft.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg po q day times nine months.
3.  Atenolol 12.5 mg po q.d.
4.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg po q.d.
5.  Atorvastatin 10 mg po q.d.
6.  Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d.
7.  Levothyroxine 150 micrograms po q.d.
8.  Vancomycin 1 gram intravenous q 12 hours times three
days.
9.  Aztreonam 1 gram intravenous q 8 hours times three days.

DISCHARGE PLAN:
1.  The patient is to follow up with her primary care
physician in one to two weeks following discharge from
rehabilitation.
2.  The patient should follow up with a cardiologist within
three months to evaluate the need for intervention on her
left anterior descending coronary artery lesion.
3.  The patient should have an MRI to evaluate her anomalous
pulmonary venous return.
