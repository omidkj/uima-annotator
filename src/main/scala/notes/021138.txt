Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough and dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis with chest tube placement ([**2123-3-4**])

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old male with no significant past medical
history who presents with a ten day history of cough productive
of blood tinged sputum, right shoulder pain and dyspnea on
exertion. He felt entirely well until ten days ago. He has a
primary care doctor in the United States for the past three
years but has not been followed for any medical problems. [**Name (NI) **] has
not had routine health screening. He is unable to quantify the
amount of sputum production or blood in his sputum. He also was
experiencing pain in his right shoulder which was worsened with
cough or deep inspiration and dyspnea with mild exertion. He was
still able to perform his activities of daily living and go to
work but he was unable to sleep for the past two nights because
of cough and shoulder pain. He presented to his primary care
doctor with these symptoms ten days ago and was treated with
azithromycin without improvement. He presented again on [**2123-2-25**]
and had a CXR performed which showed a large right sided
mediastinal mass. He was seen again today and was referred for a
CT scan of the chest. Preliminary findings on the chest CT were
concerning and he was referred to the emergency room.

In the emergency room his initial vitals were T: 97.9 HR: 98 BP:
145/93 RR: 20 O2: 98% on RA. He had a Chest CT which showed a
large right sided lung mass with associated right middle and
right lower lobe collapse and large circumfrential right sided
pleural effusion. The mass is compressing the SVC to a slit.
There is also concern regarding possible involvement of the
pericardium and myocardium. He received 4 mg IV morphine in the
emergency room with resolution of his dyspnea and right sided
shoulder pain.

On review of systems he denies fevers, chills, left sided chest
pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
dysuria, hematuria, leg pain, leg swelling, lightheadedness,
dizziness, numbness or tingling. He has had a 10 lb weight loss
over the past few weeks. All other review of systems negative in
detail.

Past Medical History:
Low Back Pain
Latent TB s/p treatment (unknown details)
Gastric Ulcer


Social History:
Originally from [**Country 651**]. Previously worked as a farmer of rice and
corn. Also worked for 2-3 years in the concrete industry. Since
coming to the United States he has worked in a super market. He

[**2123-3-11**]   Radiology FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Approved
1. Large FDG-avid right perihilar mass, involving the middle and

upper lobes and associated with extensive right hilar,
mediastinal, retrocrural and right supraclavicular FDG-avid
lymphadenopathy.
2. Extensive multifocal FDG-avid right pleural disease
associated with a moderate sized pleural effusion increased in
volume from the prior study.
3. There is nodular airspace disease in the anterior right upper
lobe having low-level tracer uptake which may be infectious,
inflammatory or neoplastic in nature.
4. There is mild tracer uptake in both adrenal glands, left
slightly greater than right, which may be physiologic but should
be re-evaluated on follow-up imaging.

[**2123-3-5**]   Pathology Tissue: FNA, 4R (Cell Block)   [**2123-3-8**]
[**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] Final
FNA, 4R lymph node, cell block:
Positive for metastatic carcinoma, most consistent with
metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung.  Note: Immunostains
show the tumor cells are positive for keratin cocktail
(AE1/AE3/CAM5.2), CK7, TTF-1 and synaptophysin; they are weakly
positive for p63, but negative for CK20, chromogranin and LCA.
The findings are most consistent with a metastatic small cell
carcinoma of the lung.

[**2123-3-4**]   Cardiology ECHO   [**2123-3-4**] [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] F.
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic
function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular regional and global
function. Very small pericardial effusion.

[**2123-3-3**]   Radiology CT CHEST W/CONTRAST     [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) 10348**] Approved

1. Widespread malignancy in the thorax, most consistent with
advanced lung cancer (likely small cell ca and less likely
agressive nonsmall cell), with associated mediastinal and
pericardial invasion, high- grade narrowing of the superior vena
cava, bronchial obstruction, diffuse lymphadenopathy, and
malignant pleural disease.
2. Indeterminate fullness of left adrenal gland. If a PET CT is
obtained as part of overall staging process, this could be
further assessed at that time.

[**2123-3-3**]   Cardiology ECG   [**2123-3-5**] [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **]
Sinus rhythm  Indeterminate axis Q-Tc interval appears prolonged
but is difficult to measure Low lateral T wave amplitude
Findings are nonspecific and may be within normal limits, but
clinical correlation is suggested
