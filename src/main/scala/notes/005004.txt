                 **FINAL REPORT [**2112-7-4**]**
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2112-7-4**]):    NO GROWTH

[**2112-7-2**] ABD CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly smaller right retroperitoneal collection with mild
rim
enhancement consistent with resolving hematoma. No new fluid
collection
identified.
2. Diverticulosis. No bowel obstruction.
3. Interval slight increase with mild intrahepatic biliary duct
dilation in the left lobe. Central ducts not dilated. This could
be from cholangitis though flagrant cholangitis is not evident.
4. Attenuated small portal venous branch from the left portal
vein into
segment 4 could be thrombosed. This could be from cholangitis or
may have
occurred after surgery as the vein was patent pre-operatively.
5. Dilated contrast filled esophagus, could be from reflux or
dismotility.

[**2112-7-3**] MRCP:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of tumor recurrence at the site of anastomosis.
2. Increase in degree of focal biliary dilatation in segment IVb
of the liver associated with retraction of the capsule and
delayed enhancement of the liver parenchyma. Findings are
consistent with cholangitis, and unlikely to be
cholangiocarcinoma. Follow up MRCP in four to six months MRCP is
recommended.
3. A number of area of peripheral triangular-shaped arterial
enhancement in the liver consistent with perfusion
abnormalities.
4. A mild increase in central intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
5. Fluid collection with enhancing rim along the right psoas
muscle,
unchanged.
6. Attenuation of the lateral branch of the left portal vein,
which may be
possibly thrombosed, as noted on the prior CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient s/p Whipple resection in [**10-17**] was transferred from
OSH with symptoms of fever, increased abdominal pain and
elevated LFTs. On HD # 1, the patient underwent abdominal CT
scan, which demonstrated mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilation
in
the left lobe [**2-10**] possible cholangitis. The patient was started
on IV Unasyn and admitted into ICU for observation. The patient
was transferred to the floor on HD # 2 in stable condition. The
patient underwent MRCP, which showed a mild increase in central
intrahepatic biliary dilatation consistent with cholangitis, no
evidence of tumor recurrence at the site of anastomosis. The
patient's pain subsided, her temperature became normal and WBC
returned WNL. On HD # 3, the patient was doing well, tolerated
regular diet without pain. The patient's Unasyn was changed to
PO Augmentin, she was discharged home in stable condition.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
