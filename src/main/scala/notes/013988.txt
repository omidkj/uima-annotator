revealed dense multi-lobular L PNA.  Patient was intubated in ED
because of increasing respiratory effort. Approximately 30mins
after intubation, she became hypotensive with mean arterial
pressure in high 50s requiring levophed.  Sepsis protocol was
initiated & patient was given empiric ceftriaxone, Azithromycin
and Vancomycin.  Initial labs were notable for a WBC of 7.6 with

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  63F w/ resp failure and hypotension likely [**1-22**]
pneumococcal PNA/sepsis.
.

#PNA
-- patient initially intubated for respiratory distress,
required 3 day ICU stay
-- patient was extubated [**2138-1-8**] without incident.
-- BCx and sputum Cx grew strep pneumoniae, sensitive to
levofloxacin
-- initially started on Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin, tailored to PO levofloxacin after cx results
returned.
-- urine legionella negative
-- kept on ATC nebs initially, incentive spirometry, chest PT.
.

#Hypotension
--- likely [**1-22**] sepsis, given IVF and started on levophed,
patient on sepsis protocol, [**Last Name (un) 104**]. stim test < 9 (but am cortisol
> 50), started hydrocort and fludrocort for equivocal [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim
but were discontinued after 2 days as pt was clinically
improved.
.

#ARF
- Likely from pre-renal state from acute infection and ATN [**1-22**]
hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.  resolved prior to
discharge.
.

#CAD
-- continued on ASA/statin/plavix, restarted ACEI
-- troponin peaked at 0.04 likely from ARF and stress event, no
EKG changes.
-- patient had some evidence of fluid overload on exam on
medical floor requiring 2 doses of 20mg IV lasix to help
mobilize anasarca.
-- fluid status should be closely monitored.  goal input/output
should be even to slightly negative for next 3-4 days. (EF 60%
on TTE [**6-22**])
-- repeat TTE as outpatient.
.
#DM2 - insulin ss while inpt, change to oral hypoglycemics prior
to d/c.
