History of Present Illness:
75 yo F who noted tongue numbness followed by tongue swelling on
[**6-9**]. She had had 2 prior episodes of tongue numbness, her 1st
episode on [**3-/2166**] without notable consequences and did not tell
anyone of these prior episodes. On [**6-9**] she was concerned about
her tongue numbness and called her grandaughter whom noticed the
patient was dysarthric, with a hoarse voice over the phone. Her
granddaughter arrived to her home and noticed cheek swelling,
with some drooling and took her grandmother to [**Hospital3 **].
The pt denied any difficulty breathing, no throat pain. She
denies any new medications or new foods. She did state that she
had bought new organic brand eggs, but has eaten eggs on a
regular basis in the past. At [**Hospital3 **] she received
Solumedrol and Ceftriaxone. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ENT
workup.  ENT scoped pt which showed angioedema.

Pertinent Results:
ENT was consulted in the ED and had an ENT scope which showed:
- no airway narrowing between back of throat and post pharyngeal
wall
- R>L Aryepiglottic folds with edema
- arytenoids with edema
- false cords with watery edema
- no hypopharyngeal masses

[**2166-6-10**] Per ENT review of OSH CT scan w/o contrast:
- R>L asymmetry below level of epiglottis c/w arythenoid and AE
fold edema
- mild stranding in anterior neck R>L
- no abscesses appreciated
.
[**2166-6-10**] CXR -
1. Cardiomegaly and diffuse interstitial abnormality. Left lower
lobe atelectasis.
2. Widening of the left paraspinal line. PA and lateral chest
radiography is recommended for further assessment.
.
[**2166-6-11**] Per ENT scope:
-Marked improvement in supraglottic edema, airway widely patent,
AE folds R>L still w/edema, erythema, post-cricoid w/erythema
.
[**2166-6-12**] CXR:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
Unchanged cardiomegaly. Within the left lower lobe, there is
obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm with opacities seen
throughout the lower portion of the left lower lobe. Findings
are consistent with pneumonia. No additional opacity are seen
throughout the lungs. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.
.
[**2166-6-12**] Renal U/S:
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 10.6 cm. The left
kidney measures 10.2 cm. No hydronephrosis, stones, or masses
are seen bilaterally. A Foley catheter is seen within a
collapsed bladder.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis or stones bilaterally.
.
[**2166-6-12**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The inferior vena cava is
dilated (>2.5 cm). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old woman presented with angioedema of unclear
precipitant at time of admission.

MICU COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the MICU for closer airway
monitoring.  She was treated with benadryl 50mg IV q4 and
decadron 10mg IV q8.  She was also started on clindaymycin for
possible infectious etiology but this was discontinued after 24
hours.  The patient's edema improved.  She was scoped by ENT on
admission which showed right greater than left aryepiglottic
folds with edema, arytenoids with edema, false cords with watery
edema, no hypopharyngeal masses.  Her O2 was continously
monitored overnight and kept with HOB>30 degrees.  A repeat
scope by ENT the morning
