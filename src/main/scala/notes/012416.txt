Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac tamponade status post pulmonary vein isolation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
atrial fibrillation ablation
pericardial tap and drain placement


History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known lastname 122**] is a 47 year old lady with w/ MMP including A.
fib/flutter w/ several ablations, DM II c/b neuropathy,
retinopathy, OSA, pul HTN, COPD on home O2 who was admitted to
the NP service for an elective PVI.
.
In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname 11042**] atrial arrhythmias have been managed with
sotalol, diltiazem, toprol and coumadin.  She is s/p ablation in
[**2173**].  Over the past several months she has noted increase in sx
of palpitations associated w/ tremors, diaphoresis and dyspnea
lasting up to several hours.  She was referred for elective PVI.
.
Per EP signout pt underwent her PVI this morning and tolerated
the procedure well. She was then planned to be observed
overnight however at 3:30pm she was noted to be hypotensive, she
also reported feeling nauseated. She was given IVF with no
improvement. Concern per EP was for cardiac tamponade vs RP
bleed. A bedside Echo was performed which was of poor quality
given the pt's body habitus. A large pericardial effusion was
noted, given the concern of postprocedure cardiac tamponade the
cath lab was activated by the EP fellow. In the cath lab bloody
drainage was noted, 100ccs was drained, pericardial pressures
were 28. A drain was left in place, per signout Cards
recommended holding off on anticoagulation despite recent PVI
will need to be addressed in the AM. Also recommended holding
all BP meds as well as Sotalol, Diltiazem, Metoprolol. Prior to
transfer pt's BP was noted to be in the 130s/80s.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
(+) chest pain w/ inspiration, orthopnea, body aches, peripheral
neuropathy, stroke, pulmonary embolism x 2.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors.  All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of orthopnea,
syncope or presyncope.

pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

accessory muscle use. CTAB however very distant breath sounds
and poor inspiratory effort. no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.

Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC ECHO [**2181-1-15**]
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a
moderate to large sized pericardial effusion.
.
Following presumed pericardiocentesis, a single cine loop
demonstrates only a small residual pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Very limited study. Moderate to large pericardial
effusion with subsequent improvement following drainage.
Recommend a follow-up focused study to better assess for success
of percutaneous drainage.
.
CARDIAC ECHO [**2181-1-16**]
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
IMPRESSION: Very small residual pericardial effusion. Grossly
normal biventricular systolic function.
.
CARDIAC ECHO [**2181-1-22**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-1-18**],
there is no defintei change. Pulmonary hypertension is now
detected.
.
CHEST XRAY [**2181-1-17**]
The cardiac silhouette appears to be enlarged with a relatively
smooth and
rounded borders that might be consistent with the presence of
pericardial
effusion. The overall cardiac silhouette is larger than on
[**2181-1-2**] MRI. The patient is currently in interstitial /
alveolar pulmonary edema, moderate most likely accompanied by
small bilateral pleural effusion.
.
ECG [**2181-1-15**]
Sinus bradycardia. Mild Q-T interval prolongation. Late R wave
progression. Lateral limb lead ST-T wave abnormalities. Since
the previous tracing of [**2181-1-2**] probably no significant change.
.
ECG [**2181-1-15**]
Sinus rhythm. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous
tracing the rate is faster.
.
ECG [**2181-1-16**]
Sinus rhythm. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous
tracing the rate
has increased.
.
ECG [**2181-1-17**]
Sinus rhythm. Diffuse ST segment elevation most consistent with
pericardial disease, although clinical correlation is suggested.
Additional non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2181-1-16**] ST segment elevation is more diffuse.

.
ECG [**2181-1-18**]
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Poor R wave
progression. Non-specific ST segment elevation in leads V1-V3.
Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes. Cannot exclude
ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2181-1-18**] T wave
inversions are more pronounced in leads V5-V6. ST segment
elevation may be slightly less pronounced.
.
ECG [**2181-1-20**]
Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contraction. Poor R wave
progression.
Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2181-1-18**] ST segment elevation is less
pronounced in leads V1-V3. Premature atrial contraction is new.
