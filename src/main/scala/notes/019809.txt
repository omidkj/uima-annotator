Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9824**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral chronic knee pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bilateral Total Knee replacements
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with aflutter s/p ablation, bronchiectasis,
HTN, hyperchol, chronic RBBB, OA s/p B TKR on [**2-17**] with post op
course complicated by anemia of unclear source and hypotension
as well as troponin leak. Pt surgery was uncomplicated with
baseline Hct 35 down to 29.6 post op with EBL 200cc. Post op the
pt was hypotensive which continued to [**2-19**] at which point she
was transferred to the SICU. As part of workup of hypotension
CE's were drawn and pt found to have troponin leak which cont to
climb now at .33 but CK's declining. Cardiology was consulted
and thought it was due to RV strain as seen on TTE as well as
demand ischemia in the setting of anemia. Pt also worked up for
PE with LENI's and CTA neg. At the same time the patient had
worsening renal failure with creat up to 2.5 but this improved
back to baseline with improved BP. Pt Hct has been stable now
for 48 hours after transfusion of 4 units PRBC's with suspected
sites of hemorrhage including epidural vs operative site. At the
same time hypotensive episode he developed elevated WBC to 12
but blood and UCX as well as CXR were neg. WBC has returned to
baseline although he cont to spike low grade fevers. Pain was
initially controled with IV narcotics but changed to epidural
due to hypotension but is now weaned to PO oxycodone.

[**2-17**] knees b/l:
DIAGNOSIS:
1. Bone and soft tissue, left knee (A-B):
1. Bone with reparative changes and focal necrosis.
2. Degenerative fibrocartilage.
2. Bone and soft tissue, right knee (C-D):
1. Bone with reparative changes and focal necrosis.
2. Degenerative fibrocartilage.
Clinical:   Osteoarthritis both knees.
.
[**2-19**] lung scan:
Ventilation images obtained with Tc99m aerosol in 8 views
demonstrate an area of decreased perfusion in the superior
segment of the left upper lobe,
consistent with the aorta. Perfusion images in the same 8 views
show a similar defect. Chest x ray showed no focal or
parenchymal abnormalities.
The above findings are consistent with a low likelihood of
pulmonary embolism.
.
TTE [**2156-2-19**]
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF
ejection fraction 60 percent%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic root is moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation  is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the
findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of [**2152-4-10**], the right ventricle appears hypokinetic.

SUMMARY OF THE PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose
of 0.142 mg/kg per minute. Two minutes after the cessation of
infusion, Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered IV.
INTERPRETATION:
Imaging protocol: gated SPECT.
Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201. Tracer
was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
This study was interpreted using the seventeen-segment
myocardial perfusion model.
DECISION: Initial stress images showed soft tissue attenuation
and
subdiaphragmatic activity, which did not improve significantly
by attenuation correction. After a 4 hour delay, a perfusion
abnormality involving the inferior wall showed significant
improvement on additional stress images.
Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged with stress and rest.
At stress, there is a mild myocardial perfusion defect involving
the distal inferior wall. This perfusion abnormality shows
reversibility with rest. Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 64%.

There are no prior studies available for comparison.

IMPRESSION: 1. Probably abnormal study showing a reversible,
mild myocardial perfusion defect involving the apical portion of
the inferior wall. 2. Enlargement of the left ventricle with EF
of 64%.
IMPRESSION: No ischemic ECG changes and non-progressive atypical
chest
discomfort was present during the entire study. Nuclear report
sent
separately.

[**2156-2-25**] cardiac cath
COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated single vessel
coronary
artery disease in this right dominant circulation. The LMCA was
heavily
calcified with a 30% distal stenosis. The LAD was a serpiginous
vessel
that was moderately calcified. A large septal and two small
diagonal
branches were without angiographically flow limiting disease.
The LCX
was a modest vessel through the AV groove. A single moderate
sized OM
was seen without flow limiting disease. There was collateral
filling
from the LCX to the RPL branch. The ramus intermedius was
without flow
limiting disease. The RCA was a heavily calcified vessel with a
mid 60%
stenosis and a distal 90% stenosis before the takeoff of the
PDA. There
was an extensive focally ectatic RPL system. The PDA had a mild
origin
stenosis and an early bifurcation.
