heart failure. Patient notes SOB for one month, cough productive
of dark green sputum, recently started on Zpak and prednisone as
outpatient without significant improvement in symptoms. Denies
fever, chills. Notes increased lower extremity edema over last
few weeks and orthopnea.

Pertinent Results:

STUDIES:
CXR [**2166-1-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary congestion. Underlying
consolidation can not be excluded.

TTE [**2166-1-4**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypo/akinesis of the inferior,
inferolateral and anterolateral and apical walls. There is mild
hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 30 %). The
estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2).
Right ventricular cavity size is mildly increased. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular cavity
enlargement with regional and global systolic dysfunction
suggestive of multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
.
CARDIAC CATH [**2166-1-7**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated
three-vessel disease. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
disease.
The LAD had a proximal 70% stenosis, diffuse mid disease up to
90%, and
an apical subtotal occlusion. The LCx had a large OM branch with
a 70%
stenosis. The RCA was occluded distally and filled via
left-right
collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated
left-sided
filling pressures with LVEDP 33mmHg. The systemic arterial blood

pressure was normal with SBP 105 mmHg and DBP 70mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Sevre LV diastolic dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
52 yo male with history of cornary artery disease, MI [**70**] years
ago. Transfered from OSH with concern for given conern for
congestive heart failure, ? NSTEMI. Pt found to have flat
cardiac enzymes and in DKA.  He was only on metformin and
glyburide at home. Ketones in urine here with anion gap elevated
suggested DKA. He was placed on an insulin drip.  His A1c was
checked and was 13.2. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and he was
transitioned to lantus and a sliding scale. Nutrition was
consulted for diabetic education.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] had no known prior history of CHF, and presented with
symptoms concerning for new onset CHF given orthopnea, worsening
dyspnea on exertion, elevated BNP, crackles on exam, and CXR
consistent with volume overload. Unclear precipitating event of
myocarditis vs. MI a month prior when symptoms began. TTE as
above demonstrated EF 30% and global hypokinesis. Cardiac cath
showed LVEDP 33. Pt was diuresed with IV lasix, and symptoms
improved.
He was started on beta blockade and Ace-I.

He presented with vague pressure in setting of worsening dyspnea
of several weeks, and did not appear to be ACS. Heparin was
initially started and discontinued as enzymes remained flat. He
was continued on ASA 325mg daily. As above, beta blockade was
started once BP's could tolerate. ACEI and crestor started. He
went for cardiac cath, which showed diffuse disease of RCA and
LAD. Cardiac surgery was consulted, and recommended CABG.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a smoker placed Nicotine patch and SW consulted for
counseling. Pt was strongly encouraged to discontinue smoking.
.
On [**2166-1-9**] he was taken to the operating room and underwent
Coronary artery bypass grafting x4, with the left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery and reversed saphenous vein grafts to the posterior
descending artery, obtuse marginal artery, and diagonal artery.
Immediately postopertively he was admitted to the ICU for
cardiopulmonary monitoring and management. On POD#1 he was
weaned from the ventialtor and extubated. Once gylemic control
was achieved he was transferred fromt he ICU to the step down
unit. His chest tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed
per protocol. He was diuresed toward his baseline weigth and his
betablocker, ace-I were titrated to optimize heart function.
Statin therapy was maintained. He was evaluated by physical
therapy for strength and conditioning and claered for discharge
on POD#6. All appointments and instructions were advised.
