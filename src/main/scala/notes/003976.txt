Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Intubation while in intensive care unit
-Placement of right internal jugular central venous line while
in intensive care unit
-Placement of a right arm mid-line PICC for additional IV access

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year of female NH resident with a past medical
history of chronic aspiration (on precautions, puree diet),
severe dementia, HTN, DM2, recurrent   UTIs, systolic CHF (EF
40%), stable gout and chronic anemia (mixed ACD &
iron-deficiency) who presented initially for acute onset altered
mental status, hypotension and bradycardia. She was noted to be
non-verbal and non-responsive to visual stimuli by her nursing
home so she was sent to the [**Hospital3 **] ED and then to [**Hospital1 18**]
emergency room. At baseline she is verbal but intermittently
confused; mostly A&Ox1. She does not walk on her own and is bed
bound. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] she was hypotensive to 90/60 range
and bradycardic to 30s. FSG was 114, afebrile, and saturating
fiarly well at 98% on RA. Of note, per NH report, she was
diagnosed with a UTI on [**1-8**] and started on levofloxacin. Labs
on that day also noted an increased BUN to 52 and was started on
IVF at her NH. She was then transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
At [**Hospital1 **], HR initially remained in the 30s to 40s and blood
pressures were initially stable at 102/59. However, she then
dropped to the 70s systolic. She was given 1mg atropine with
little effect. Received only 500cc of NS out of concern for
possible pulmonary edema on CXR. BNP 391. Also noted some
questionable left facial droop but initial non-contrast CT head
was negative for acute process. Initial cardiac enzymes were all
negative at time of her initial emergency transfer and workup.
Due to persistent hypotension she was started on peripheral
dopamine, given IVFs and transferred to ICU for monitoring. For
safety, she needed intubation for several days in ICU while
hemodynamics stabilized and then she was extubated.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 15569**] MICU course was notable for low platelets and
hematology/oncology service was consulted. Ultimately given
diagnosis of HIT after PF4 Abs returned positive and all heparin
being avoided since that time. She also had transient ARF which
resolved over several days and worse rhonchi on lung exam with
some opacities on serial CXRs so she was treated for VAP
alongside antibiotics for her urosepsis coverage. Once stable,
she was transferred to medical floor where she was noted to have
some RUE edema and asymmetry. Follow-up RUE ultrasound showed
DVT so she is now on course of Coumadin therapy after being
bridged with fondaparinux . Team needed to adjust/hold
occasional doses, give PRN vitamin k to aim for INR goal [**2-28**].

Past Medical History:
-Recent admit to [**Hospital1 **] [**11-3**] for sepsis/aspiration pneumonia
-Severe Dementia
-Chronic back pain
-Chronic gait disorder with multiple falls / mainly bed bound
-Hypertension
-Diabetes Mellitus type 2
-Frequent UTIs
-Gout; no recent flare-ups

Social History:
Patient had been semi-independent with help of her son a few
months prior to recent nursing home placement after
sepsis/aspiration pneumonia. She was living in nursing home in
[**Hospital1 **] and mostly bed bound prior to this admission per her son
( [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]). No significant alcohol, smoking or illicit
drug use history.

.
[**1-12**] Renal ultrasound
1. Irregular fluid collection around the upper pole of the right
kidney,
concerning for perinephric abscess. Collection measures roughly
2.4 x 3.5 cm. 2. Moderate amount of fluid in the pelvis. 3.
Normal left kidney.
.
[**1-12**] TTE -
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**1-13**] CT Torso -
1. Gall bladder wall edema. In case of clinical concern for
cholecystitis
right upper quadrant ultrasound is recommended.
2. Limited evaluation due to lack of IV contrast however no
definite
perinephric fluid collection. Small amount of fluid in the right
perinephric space is nonspecific but does not have the
appearance of an abscess.
3. Moderate-volume intra-abdominal ascites.
4. Colonic diverticulosis, mostly in the ascending colon, with
no evidence of diverticulitis.
5. Cardiomegaly and severe coronary artery calcifications.
6. Bilateral small pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis. Severe
emphysema.
.
RUQ U/S
Severely thickened gallbladder wall. Differential diagnosis is
broad and
includes underlying liver disease and fluid overload. Clinical
correlation is recommended. Echogenic liver may represent fatty
deposition. Please note that other liver disease such as
fibrosis or cirrhosis cannot be excluded
.

IMPRESSION: No lower extremity deep venous thrombosis
bilaterally.

[**1-18**] RUE Doppler US -
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right
subclavian, internal
jugular, axillary, paired brachials, cephalic, and basilic veins
were
performed. Within the right internal jugular vein, a focal
approximately 1.2 cm in length area of non-occlusive thrombus
was identified with flow preserved within the right internal
jugular vein. The right internal jugular vein was not fully
compressible. There is normal flow and compressibility of the
right axillary, paired brachials, cephalic, basilic, and
subclavian veins. Note is made of a variant with two axillary
veins noted.  IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus wit
