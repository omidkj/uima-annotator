History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 89201**] is a 72yo F with HTN, dyslipidemia, emphysema, RA
on prednisone who presented on [**4-18**] for catheterization in the
setting of exertional dyspnea and chest pressure with EKG
changes with diffuse RCA disease s/p Rota with DESx3. Post
procedure, she felt well throughout the day and was admitted to
CNP service. Overnight she developed right sided lower abdominal
pain and right groin pain and was noted to have a hematoma at
the access site. She had a vasovagal episode (with SBP in 60's)
this AM on walking to the bathroom. Her BP has been relatively
low to the SBP 90s. Her pain worsened and her HCT noted to drop
by 10 points (was 40 at OSH prior to admission). Sent for CT
A/P, found to have large RP bleed. Blood pressures in 90-100's.
Transferred to CCU for further monitoring.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2149-4-20**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2149-4-20**]):
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT
WITH FECAL
      CONTAMINATION.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2149-4-18**]:
1. Severe coronary artery disease: see above comments
2. Successful rotational atherectomy/PTCA/stenting of the
ostial/proximal RCA with a Promus Rx 4.0x18 mm [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]-dilated
with an NC 4.0 mm balloon. (see PTCA comments)
3. Successful rotational atherectomy/PTCA/stenting of the mid
RCA with a Promus Rx 3.5x12 mm [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 89202**] with a Promus Rx
3.5x15 mm DES (proximally) which were all post-dilated with an
NC 3.5 mm balloon. (see PTCA comments)
4. R 8Fr femoral artery Angioseal closure device was deployed
without complications; R 8Fr femoral vein sheath removed with
manual compression applied in the cath lab (see PTCA comments)
5. ASA 325 mg indefinitely; plavix (clopidogrel) 75 mg daily for
at least 12 months for DES

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS NON CONTRAST [**2149-4-19**]:
1. Large retroperitoneal hemorrhage in the pelvis, centered on
the right, adjacent to the urinary bladder.
2. 11-mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule is concerning for
carcinoma and only partially visualized and therefore needs
further workup with chest CT.

FEMORAL ARTERY ULTRASOUND [**2149-4-19**]: No evidence of
pseudoaneurysm.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 89201**] is a 72yo F with HTN, dyslipidemia, emphysema, RA
on prednisone who presented on [**4-18**] for catheterization in the
setting of exertional dyspnea and chest pressure with EKG
changes with diffuse RCA disease s/p Rota with DESx3. Post
procedure, she felt well throughout the day and was admitted to
CNP service. Overnight she developed right sided lower abdominal
pain and right groin pain and was noted to have a hematoma at
the access site. She had a vasovagal episode (with SBP in 60's)
that AM on walking to the bathroom. Her BP had been relatively
low to the SBP 90s. Her pain worsened and her HCT noted to drop
by 10 points (was 40 at OSH prior to admission). Sent for CT
A/P, found to have large RP bleed. Blood pressures in 90-100's.
Transferred to CCU for further monitoring.

CCU COURSE:
Patient was admitted to the CCU in the setting of an RP bleed
after coronary catheterization. She received 2 units pRBCs with
eventual stabilization of her hematocrit (initial serial
measurements fell in the low thirties, but eventually showed
appropriate increase to 34.8). She was also started on bactrim
for a dirty UA in the setting of increased urinary frequency.
Given stabilization of hematocrit and hemodynamic stability
(blood pressures remained in the 90s-100s throughout) she was
transferred out of the CCU back to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management.

She fared well on the cardiology floor and had no further
complications.  Her hematocrit remained stable after serial
assays, and she remained hemodynamically stable after 24 hours
of telemetric monitoring.  She was subsequently discharged home.

The rest of her medical problems are enumerated below:
1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE S/P INTERVENTION:  She had a ROTA and
DESx3 of the right coronary artery in response to exertional
dyspnea. She had no further symptoms in house.  Her post
procedure cardiac enzymes were normal.  She was discharged on a
medical regimen of aspirin, plavix (12months), toprol XL,
valsartan, and atorvastatin.

2. ?URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  She had leukocytes in her urine
though it was a contaminated sample, and the culture grew mixed
flora.  She did have suprapubic tenderness, so she was treated
with bactrim DS 1 tab [**Hospital1 **] for 3 days, though her pain may have
been related to
