Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old diabetic woman with CAD s/p [**2157**] CABG
(LIMA to LAD, SVG to D1, SVG to D2, SVG to OM. SVG to PDA), s/p
catheterization in [**2162**] with LAD stent in [**2162**] and revealing
occluded SVG to D1, SVG to D2, SVG to OM and patent LIMA and
patent SVG to rPDA. Also with systolic CHF with EF 40-45%, PPM
in [**8-/2168**], carotid stenosis/TIAs, and s/p living-related renal
transplant in [**2161-9-13**] with baseline Cr 1.6--2.0.
.
She presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] on [**2169-3-28**] with complaints
of of shortness of breath. Per the patient, she had been feeling
worsening shortness over the prior few days to the point she
could only take a few steps. She was ruled out for myocardial
infarction by cardiac enzymes. She had elevated CK's but low MB
fraction and negative troponins. The patient was noted to be
anemic and received two unit packed RBC's. The patient was also
noted to be hyperkalemic and hyponatremic; she was presumed to
have aldosterone insufficiency and was, was placed on florinef
and salt tablets. The patient was diuresed on a day to day basis
and her oxygenation and volume status would improve with
diuresis. Her volume status, however, would worsen soon after
the diuretic wore off Today was in respiratory distress and
hypoxic. Chest X-ray revealed pulmonary edema. Placed on
non-rebreather, ABG 7.31/46/113. Patient given lasix 80mg IV and
zaroxylyn with improved oxygenation. Concern was raised for new
ischemic event leading to L heart failure and pulmonary edema.
For this reason, transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] was requested for possible
cardiac catheterization.
.
On arrival, the patient reports her breathing is still
uncomfortable. She denies having had any chest pain the past few
weeks but does report continued epigastric pain and nausea (also
reported at the outside hospital). No palpitations or
lightheadedness

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2169-4-8**] 7:58 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Please evaluate for pulmonary edema

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old woman with CHF, CABG, in resp distress
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for pulmonary edema
CLINICAL HISTORY: Respiratory distress status post CABG.

CHEST

The heart is enlarged. Bilateral pleural effusions present.
There is a general pulmonary plethora consistent with cardiac
failure.

IMPRESSION: Acute cardiac failure.
.
EKG: NSR at rate 70-80, Axis 40, PR prolongation at 200 ms, QT
prolongation 160 ms, STD in aVL v4-6 are old. No significant
change from EKGs at OSH

Brief Hospital Course:
#) Acute exacerbation of CHF (EF 45%): This was likely secondary
to excess Sodium load at OSH. We also believe that her
hypertension also a likely contributer.  Initially she was
difficult to diurese and required a lasix drip.  She improved
with removing fluid as well as afterload reduction.  She was
maintained on a fluid restriction and her blood pressure
medications were titrated. She was diuresed on lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
but her creatinine increased to 2.2 after a day in which she was
negative about 1 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was discharged on 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]. She
should have ins and outs monitored (with goal of running even
+400 ccs for insensible losses), vs strict daily weights (goal
to maintain current fluid status) to monitor fluid balance. A
chest x-ray was performed on the day of discharge to establish
her current pulmonary status, for the purposes of outpatient
follow-up by her outpatient providers.
.
#) CAD s/p CABG: Cardiac cath in [**2162**] showed LIMA to LAD and SVG
to R-PDA patent, SVGs to OM, D1, D2 occluded.  She was continued
on continued on ASA, plavix, lipitor and carvedilol.  Her ACEi
was stopped because of some mild renal failure, as recommended
by the renal transplant team.  Her repeat echo showed mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis/near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral
walls, consistent with 1 vessel CAD.  This seemed consistent
with her previous P-MIBI study, showing a fixed wall defect. She
was monitored on telemetry and had no major events; she does
have periodic PVCs.
.
#) Chronic kidney disease/Hyponatremia: s/p LRRT in [**2160**] with
baseline Cr 1.6-2.  She was followed in house by the renal
transplant team.  Her ACEi was stopped as noted above because of
mild renal failure.  She was continued on her prograf and
prednisone, and tacrolimus levels were followed in house. She
was discharged on 3 mg of tacrolimus q12 hours. She will follow
up with her transplant nephrologist on [**4-24**]. In terms of her
hyponatremia, this was resolving at the time of discharge given
correction for high glucose. The most likely explanation for her
dip in sodium is CHF, given that urine lytes were not consistent
with SIADH. However, because of this possible effect of
citalopram, her dose was decreased as this may have been
contributing.
.
Her creatinine rose to 2.2 on the day of discharge, likely
secondary to aggressive diuresis as above. Her lasix dose was
reduced to 40 mg a day [**H
