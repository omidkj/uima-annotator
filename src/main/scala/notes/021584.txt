CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Disabling claudication of the right lower
extremity for approximately six months to a year.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 36403**] is a 64-year-old
white female with a past medical history significant for
hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 4436**] office with a complaint of disabling claudication
in her right lower extremity thigh and calf that occurred
after walking approximately one block.  It was relieved by
resting one to two minutes and recurred after she resumed
ambulation.  She had an magnetic resonance scan of her back
as well as x-rays which failed to reveal any kind of
degenerative joint disease.  She is evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]
who felt that it was secondary to aortoiliac disease and
arterial insufficiency.  She was sent for an angiogram which
revealed diffuse disease of the lower abdominal aorta
especially just above the iliac bifurcation with complete
occlusion of the right common iliac artery.  Stenosis of the
proximal left iliac artery, proximal left external iliac
artery and at the ostium of the left internal iliac artery.
No evidence of disease in the femoral arteries on either side
was noted.  There was patency of the three distal vessel run
offs in the right lower leg with the exception of the distal
few cm of the anterior tibial arteries with no complaint of
the dorsalis pedis on that side and focal stenosis in the
distal peroneal artery.  Due to these findings it was decided
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] that she would require an aortobifemoral
bypass and she was subsequently admitted for this procedure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension and
hyperlipidemia that is managed with oral medication.  She has
a history of proteinuria with workup pending at this time.
Also of note with that is mild hyponatremia and hypokalemia
that is managed with oral medications.  She also has a
history of urinary tract infection with questionable
pyelonephritis in the past managed with antibiotics.
Hypothyroidism.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for bladder suspension as
well as left shoulder surgery for a bursitis and a left
ganglion cyst.  She also admits to a history of having
tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy performed as well as a
hysterectomy.

MEDICATIONS IN ADMISSION:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q day.
2.  Verapamil 240 mg p.o. q day, sustained release.
3.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day.
4.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q day.
5.  Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q day.
6.  Synthroid 0.112 mcg p.o. q day.
7.  Amitriptyline 10 mg p.o. q day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for her being married and living
with her husband at this time.  She has a significant history
of nicotine abuse with an over 100 pack year history that
continues today.  She denies any history of alcohol abuse.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] where she underwent an
aorto-bifemoral bypass on [**2143-12-12**].  Details of this
procedure are dictated in a separate operative note.  On the
way to surgery she had become lightheaded and had a
pre-syncopal episode, was initially taken to the Emergency
Room prior to admission.  This was felt to be secondary to
mild hypovolemia and hypokalemia.  She subsequently was taken
to the pre-op holding area where she was hydrated adequately
and her electrolytes were repleted.  She felt better, back to
her baseline and it was decided they would continue with
surgery.  Postoperatively she did quite well and was
transferred up to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit.  She was
monitored with a Swann-Ganz catheter for any fluid shifts as
well as cardiac events.  Initially postoperatively she was
maintained on renal dose Dopamine as well as Neo-Synephrine
for a low blood pressure and low SVR and low urine output.
She subsequently improved with two units of packed red blood
cells and some mild gentle hydration.

On postoperative day one she was subsequently weaned off of
both medications and had adequate urine output.  She
continued to do well and was maintained on NPO until her
bowel function returned.  Her electrolytes were repleted
adequately and she continued to progress well without any
hemodynamically significant events.

On postop day four her Swann-Ganz catheter was removed and
she was now making good urine, passing flatus and was having
a clear lung exam.  She was gotten out of bed and evaluated
by physical therapy.  They felt she would need several days
of acute rehabilitation while in hospital and would benefit
from another two days.

Currently she is doing quite well and she is tolerating an
oral diet without any difficulty.  She is afebrile with vital
signs stable.  She has been restarted on all of her usual
medications.  Her physical examination at this time reveals a
well developed female appearing older than her standard age
of 64.  Her neck is supple without evidence of jugular venous
distention and there is a left carotid bruits.  Her heart is
regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally without wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds
present.  Her incisions are clean, dry and intact with
staples present in the midline and in both groins.  There is
no drainage from these incisions or erythema noted.  Her
pulse exam is remarkable for palpable femoral pulses
bilaterally as well as posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.

Her disposition at this time is stable, progressing well.
She will be discharged when she is cleared by physical
therapy and wishes to be discharged home to go to a
rehabilitation facility.  Her staples are to remain in until
she follows up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in approximately 10 days to
two weeks.  A nurse will be arranged for routine vitals and
monitoring.  At this point home physical therapy is not
necessary.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Same as admission medication list
without changes.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Disabling claudication secondary to severe aortoiliac
    disease and right common iliac artery occlusion.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Low urine output, currently resolved.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Urinary tract infection.  Currently resolved.
7.  Anemia postoperatively resolved with blood transfusion.

LABORATORY VALUES:  At the time of discharge are significant
for glucose of 111, BUN 10, creatinine 0.5, potassium 3.7,
calcium 8.2, phosphorus 3.0, magnesium 1.4, hematocrit 31.3.
White blood count was within normal range.  Her
electrocardiogram is without change from her admission which
revealed mildly prolonged QT interval without evidence of
ischemic changes.  A chest x-ray revealed resolving
congestive heart failure as well as bibasilar atelectasis.
She is being treated with her daily doses of diuretics.
