Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F extensive PMH including CHF, A Fib on coumadin, chronic
thromboembolic PHTN who presents with hematemesis. Patient's
caretaker noticed her coughing up bright red blood (quarter size
clots) today and consequently brought her to the ED for
evaluation. Vitals on presentation were 97.5 88 99/62 18 85. On
evaluation patient produced large amounts of hematemesis and
required intubation for desaturation and airway protection. She
was given 40 mg protonix, 10 mg IV vitamin K and 2 L of NS. Her
labs were significant for HCT of 20 and creatinine 5.3. BP
ranged from 87-114/54-64. She was transferred to the MICU for
management of upper GI bleed.
.
Patient was recently discharged [**2199-2-8**] from the [**Hospital1 1516**] service
home with hospice following a complicated hospital course.
Patient presented with shortness of breath secondary to CHF
exacerbation, was aggressively diuresised but developed
hematemesis and worsening renal failure. Her renal failure did
not improve and her bleeding source was never found. During the
admission bloody material came from her mouth, but it was not
clear whether it was emesis or cough. There was concern for
malignancy based on prior CT showing thyroid mass and LAD, but a
follow-up non-contrast chest CT did not suggest new pathology.
ENT did not visualize any bleeding source down to the glottis
level. GI was consulted but GI and primary team agreed that
risks of EGD outweighed benefits unless Hct unstable. Prior to
discharge she did have grossly apparent dark red blood in her
bowel movements suggestive of GI etiology. Patient was also
treated for kleibsella UTI during the admission. Due to her
increasingly difficult-to-manage systolic and diastolic CHF,
combined with increasingly severe renal failure and unknown
source of bleed decision was made for comfort focus and she was
discharged home with hospice.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F CHF, A Fib on coumadin, chronic thromboembolic PHTN who
presents with hematemesis. Patient recently discharged home with
hospice [**2199-2-8**] from [**Hospital1 1516**] service following complicated admission
with CHF exacerbation, renal failure and hematemesis.
.
# Hematemesis: Significant upper GI bleed with hematocrit drop
20 from most recent HCT of 25. Etiology most likely esophagitis,
gastritis versus peptic ulcer disease. Prior EGD [**2193**]
demonstrates gastritis (history of h. pylori). Patient given 10
mg IV vitamin K in ED. Patient home hospice/DNR/DNI prior to
admission, unfortunately unable to reach HCP at time of
presentation and thus she was intubated in the emergency
department.  HCP was out of the country.  Her [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) **] was
the only family available by phone.  Based on extensive
documention in OMR no central line, pressors or extreme
aggressive measures.  We spoke with the hospice nurse involved
in the case as well as available family and decision was made
not to initiate any further invasive procedures.
.
# Positive Ua: Patient oliguric with multiple prior positive
cultures for KLEBSIELLA and is most likely colonized. Patient
treated last admission for Klebsiella with ceftriaxone.  Abx
were held as most likely is colonized. Patient hypotensive
secondary to hypovolemia/blood loss and unlikely sepsis.
.
# CHF: Severe diastolic dysfunction and TR. Recent admission
with aggressive diuresis.  This was monitored.

# Atrial fibrillation: Currently irregular rate. Patient is not
anticoagulated based on goals of care.
.
# CKD: Baseline renal insufficiency worsened last admission,
continues to climb. Lytes within normal limits.  No further labs
were drawn after it was decided not to pursue further
monitoring.
.
# Goals of care: Patient recently discharged home with hospice
however was brought into ED for evaluation. Most likely
caretaker felt overwhelmed at home. Unfortunately, we are unable
to reach patient's HCP for further direction.  Touched base with
primary providers, hospice nurse, and available family.
Confirmed that pt and HCP had decided on DNR/DNI, no furthe
treat
