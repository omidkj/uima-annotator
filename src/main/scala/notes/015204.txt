Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement/removal


History of Present Illness:
33 yo male with ESRD presents to ED for uncontrolled back pain.
Pt seen in ED yesterday, x-ray negative, given percocet and
valium and discharged home.  However, he missed his HD session
yesterday given that the dialysis chair exacerbates his back
pain, and he returned to the ED today.  He was given IV morphine
and dilaudid for pain control and is being admitted to medicine
for dialysis and further treatment.
.
In the ED, vitals were 97.6/71/108/68/16/ 100% RA.  Labs
revealed a creatinine of 17.7, K+ 5.1.
.
Pt states the pain began Sunday morning somewhat slowly but then
progressed over the course of the day.  He took his children to
Six Flags, but limited his activity, and by the time he arrived
home, he was in excruciating pain.  After dc from the ED, he
took the valium and 2 percocets, and was able to sleep for 2
hours before awakening again for pain.  Tried to take another
valium and percocet, but did not receive any relief.  Pt states
he has had similar pain, particularly with his hemorrhoids, in
the past, but never to this degree. No new heavy lifting, no new
activities.  Pain is located midline L4-L5 area and then
radiates to the posterior aspect of his thigh/inferior gluteus.
He has also started having B/L groin pain which is new today.
Describes pain as constant [**4-28**] pain with intermittent "cramps"
up to [**2165-8-26**].  No numbness or tingling, is anuric from ESRD but
denies any fecal incontinence, no saddle anesthesia.  No recent
falls or injuries.  No preceding F/C/wt loss or night sweats, no
rash.  No recent URIs or other viral illness, no sick contacts,
no myalgias, other arthralgias, or malaise.  Does note rectal
bleeding in the recent past [**2-19**] hemorrhoids, states that this
occurs almost on a daily basis for the past year.  All other ROS
negative.

Reports:
[**2163-9-12**] Cardiac MR: mpression:
1. Normal regional left ventricular systolic function with
mildly increased left ventricular cavity size. The LVEF was low
normal at 56%. The effective forward LVEF was minimally
decreased at 53%.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
The RVEF was normal at 62%.
3. Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral
regurgitation.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was mildly increased.
5. Normal coronary artery origins with no evidence of anomalous
coronary
arteries, and normal signal characteristics of all visualized
vessel segments.

[**2163-9-12**] [**Month/Day/Year 47963**]: The lower lumbar spine as well as the pelvic
bones are obscured by retained contrast in the bowel from a
prior contrast examination; within these limitations, there is
mild lumbar scoliosis convex to the left. There is no fracture.
The sacroiliac joints and the hip joints are unremarkable. The
bowel gas patterns appear unremarkable.
CONCLUSION:
No bony abnormality or fracture.

[**2163-9-14**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2163-9-14**] MR [**Last Name (Titles) 47963**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis. No epidural
collection.
2. At L4/5
