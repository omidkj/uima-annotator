History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39239**] is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of
nonischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent mitral valve
replacement in the past with a prior ICD who presented early in
[**Month (only) 547**] following a syncopal event. The patient has a long history
of cardiomyopathy with EF of about 20-25%, also history of
arrhythmias including bradycardia, atrial fibrillation and VT.
Based on these findings and the symptomatology of congestive
heart failure, his cardiologist referred him to us for placement
of epicardial leads and biventricular pacing.

Past Medical History:

Neuro: nonfocal


Pertinent Results:
[**2188-4-18**] chest x-ray: Chest radiograph is unchanged in appearance
and there is persistent small left apical pneumothorax and
air-fluid levels identified on PA and lateral views which may
represent summation shadows or a possible hydropneumothorax. The
ICD pocket appears unremarkable on lateral view. There is
unchanged persistent left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation
with remaining lungs appearing clear. No evidence of pulmonary
edema. Small left-sided pleural effusion is unchanged. Vertical
linear opacity likely representing atelectasis is unchanged
projecting over the right mid and lower hemithoraces.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39239**] was admitted for heparinization. He was noted to have
acute renal insufficiency thought to be related to prerenal
azotemia. Prior to surgical intervention, his creatinine
improved. On [**4-16**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed a thorascopic
epicardial lead placement. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, he
was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. His CSRU course was uneventful and he transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day one. Warfarin and his preoperative
medications were resumed. He remained on Heparin until he became
therapeutic on Warfarin. Warfarin  was dosed for a goal INR
between 2.5 - 3.0. A routine postop chest x-ray was notable for
a small left apical pneumothorax. Serial chest x-rays were
performed which showed stable pneumothorax. His postoperative
course was otherwise unremarkable. He remained stable on medical
therapy and was discharged to home on postoperative day seven.
