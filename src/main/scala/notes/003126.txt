Chief Complaint:
Slurred speech, facial droop

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
69 year old right-handed woman with hx HTN, CHF, afib on
coumadin p/w slurred speech and right facial droop. Patient, as
per son, had
recently been D/Ced ([**1-23**]) from [**Hospital **] Hospital due to rapid
afib requiring ICU admission. She was currently at [**Hospital3 **], recovering. She woke-up at 6am and was found to have
slurred speech (some descriptions of difficulty speaking as
well)
and she had difficulty to move the R side; with R facial
weakness
as well. She was taken to OSH. BP was 230/111 with an INR 2.0;
found to have
a L basal ganglia bleed 1.9 x 1.8 cm with no shift. She was
given
2U FFP, vitamin K 10mg x1 and several doses of labetolol
20/40/40/60 and she was transferred here. Her speech improved
over time but not the weakness. BP here was 174/111 HR 88 and
she
was started on labetolol gtt. She received another unit FFP as
INR 1.8; repeat CT head was stable.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2150-2-12**]):

Imaging:

CT [**2150-2-9**]:
1. Left basal ganglia hemorrhage with surrounding vasogenic
edema. No new
foci of acute hemorrhage.
2. Hyperdense extra-axial calcified round lesion at the left
frontoparietal
vertex, which likely represents a meningioma. Further
characterization with
MRI is recommended if clinically indicated and if there is no
contraindication
to use MRI.


CT [**2149-2-10**]:
Again noted is a small focus of acute hemorrhage within the left
thalamus. It
currently measures 18 x 16 mm which is essentially unchanged in
size from
prior keeping in account differences in technique. There is
mild-moderate
surrounding vasogenic edema, unchanged. Though these are likely
to be related
to hypertension, underlying lesion cannot be excluded Again
noted is a right
maxillary mucous retention cyst and basilar and bilateral middle
cerebral
artery calcifications. There is an unchanged left frontoparietal
(near the
vertex) ossified lesion, likely representing an ossified
meningioma. There
are multiple periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodense foci noted
likely related to sequelae of small vessel ischemic disease.
Atherosclerotic
vascular calcifications are noted.
The paranasal air sinuses and mastoid air cells are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

Stable appearance of small focus of acute hemorrhage in the left
thalamus with some surrounding edema.Though this is likely to be
related to hypertension, underlying lesion cannot be excluded.
MR can be considered, if clinically indicated, after resolution
of the hemorrhage.

CXR [**2150-2-9**]:
No previous images. The heart is substantially enlarged and
there
is haziness at both bases consistent with some pleural fluid.
There is mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. The
dichotomy raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or right
pleural effusion.

No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to neuro ICU for evaluation and treatment
of stroke. She was transfered from OSH with speech difficulty ,
right hemiplegia  and facial droop and CT head demonstrating a
left basal ganglia bleed- 1.9 x 1.8 cm. She was on coumadin with
INR 2 and her blood pressure was 230/110 at OSH. Prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] she was reversed with FFP, and vitamin K 10 mg
and several doses of labetalol for blood pressure control. She
was transfered out of ICU on [**2150-2-11**] on stroke neurology floor
for further care.

Neuro
She was closely monitored for neurological signs and
improvement. She was noted to have non fluent aphasia with
nearly intact comprehension, with right hemiplegia and facial
droop. She underwent CT scan which showed left basal ganglia
bleed with some edema. She was monitored closely for signs of
raised ICP which she did
