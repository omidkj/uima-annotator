History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a G2P0010 26 yo F, now estimated to 10 weeks
pregnant, transferred from [**Hospital 487**] Hospital for asystolic
cardiac arrest. LMP is not known but was sometime in [**Month (only) **].
On [**2181-11-27**], the patient began feeling achy and congested. She
had received a flu shot about 1 week prior. She continued to
feel poorly on [**2181-11-28**], and developed hyperemesis. She was seen
in the ED (but not admitted) at [**Hospital3 **], where she was
given IVF, Reglan and Tylenol and she was found to have a
positive pregnancy test. On [**2181-11-30**], she returned to the ED
with worsening of symptoms. She was admitted to the OB service
and given IVF and Reglan. Of note, her labwork on [**2181-11-30**]
demonstrated a blood glucose of 160, bicarbonate of 11, beta-hCG
of 3373 and ketones in her urine. On [**2181-12-1**], her family noted
that she was breathing rapidly and was quite somnolent.
.
Early on [**2181-12-2**], she appeared to be in respiratory distress.
She was intubated and transferred to the ICU at the OSH. During
transfer, she became unresponsive and experience asystolic
cardiac arrest. A full code was initiated and pursued for
approximately 30 minutes.
.
After resuscitation, she was found to have an alteration in
mental status with report of fixed pupils. A head CT
demonstrated cerebral edema with small ventricles. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on ventilatory support and 2 pressors.
.
ROS: unable to obtain from patient, per family report - no fever

.
EEG: ABNORMALITY #1: Little activity of clearly cortical origin
could be
discerned during this tracing. Occasional bursts lasting for
less than
one second of multifocal [**6-6**] Hz theta frequency or faster
frequency
activity was seen in several locations; this was not reproduced
in any
predictable way. It was not activated by vocal or noxious
stimulation.
SLEEP: There were no normal sleep or wake transitions seen.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of only
occasional bursts of apparent cortically generated background
rhythms
without reactivity consistent with a severe encephalopathy of
toxic,
metabolic, or anoxic etiology. Note is made of a tachycardia on
cardiac
rhythm strip.

LABS: notable for Na 126, K 3.9, HCO3- 10, Cr 2.1, Glu 306; MBI
1.5, TnT 0.130; beta hCG 634, WBC 25.8, Hct 33.8; see below for
remainder
.
IMAGING:
[**2181-12-2**] Portable CXR: Increased density at the left lung base
consistent with atelectasis or consolidation and possibly a
small left effusion.  Endotracheal tube in satisfactory
position.  The nasogastric tube is slightly high.
.
[**2181-12-2**] Portable CXR: L SC tip in SVC.  No evidence of
pneumothorax.
.
[**2181-12-2**] Abdominal U/S: 1. Cystic structure within a poorly
visualized endometrium, which may represent a gestational sac.
Its internal contents cannot be well visualized. The
differential diagnosis includes a normal pregnancy or a
nonviable pregnancy. 2.  Ovaries not visualized.
.
[**2181-12-2**] EEG: Abnormal EEG due to the presence of only
occasional bursts of apparent cortically generated background
rhythms without reactivity consistent with a severe
encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. Note is
made of a tachycardia on cardiac rhythm strip.
.
[**2181-12-2**] Head CT: normal
.
[**2181-12-3**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis. LV systolic function
appears depressed. Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e'
<8  suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2181-12-5**] Head CT: Findings consistent with diffuse anoxic injury
are new since [**2181-12-2**]. Recommendations were made to correlate
with nuclear medicine brain scan to confirm suspected brain
death.
.
EKG: sinus tach

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted from an outside hospital with altered
mental status after asystolic cardiac arrest presumed to be
secondary to DKA and subsequent metabolic derrangements. The
patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated on arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**]. She was overbreathing the ventilator, likely a result of
respiratory compensation for a metabolic acidosis. She had thick
secretions which were presumed to be either from aspiration PNA
versus ARDS. She was started on broad coverage antibiotics to
cover for possible aspiration pneumonia.
.
At the outside hospital, Ms. [**Known lastname **] required dopamine and
levophed for hypotension which was most likely secondary to
post-arrest cardiogenic shock with a subsequent surge in
inflammatory mediators. Other etiologies, such as sepsis or
Addison's disease, were also considered. She was started on
stress dose steroids, aggressively rehydrated and eventually
weaned off of dopamine. However, she required levophed
throughout her stay. An ECHO demonstrated an ejection fraction
of 35-40% with moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Cardiac troponin peaked at 0.22 with an MB-index of 4.3. EKG
demonstrated sinus tachycardia. Blood, sputum and urine cul
