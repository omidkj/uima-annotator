L sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
65yo man with PMH significant for small cell lung cancer
metastatic to the liver and bone, HTN, hyperlipidemia, OCPD,
presents as a transfer from an OSH with new onset headache, L
hemiparesis, and alteration of consciousness. He presented to
the OSH on [**2158-1-26**] with acute on chronic diffuse abdominal
pain. The day of transfer, his RN found him at 9am with his legs
over the side of the bed, lethargic, incontinent of urine, and
complaining of a new frontal headache. He had a left facial
droop and left hemiparesis. He was taken to the head CT, where
he was found to have a right frontal hemorrhage, reported to be
3.5cm x 2cm. He also had plts of 38 and was transfused one pack
of platelets. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

On arrival, he endorsed headache and abdominal pain but no other
complaints. His brother noted that he had not been doing as well
recently, but was still looking to fight through his illness. He
has been treated with chemotherapy with fair stability of the
lesions (last CT showing LAD, hepatic mets with no significant
change, but an increased size of the lung lesion), but has had a
60lb weight loss, decreased appetite and po intake, and 4 months
of abdominal pain. He was started on topotecan one week prior to
admission.

L leg 1-2/5, able to see contraction of hamstrings and motion of
toes.

On discharge:
MS: Frequently sleeping (sometimes with eyes open) but arousable
and will follow commands and answer questions appropriately.
Cranial nerves: as above, but gaze at midline.

IMAGING:
Head CT noncontrast: Examination is limited secondary to patient
motion. There is a large hemorrhage in the right fronto-temporal
lobe extending to basal ganglia measuring approximately 6.3 x
2.0 cm with surrounding hypodensity consistent with edema. Just
superior to this large hemorrhage are multiple smaller punctate
foci of hemorrhage. There is mass effect on the right lateral
ventricle with 2 mm of midline shift to the left. There is
probable mild subfalcine herniation. The remaining ventricles
are not dilated. The basal cisterns are patent. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is grossly preserved. The surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. The imaged
paranasal sinuses are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: Right fronto-temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage
extending to basal ganglia with surrounding edema with slight
degree of midline shift.

Head MRI w/o & w/contrast: FINDINGS: Today's exam is correlated
with head CT from [**2158-1-28**]. As noted on the
examination, there is a large right frontal temporal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage extending into the basal ganglia.
There is surrounding edema and mass effect upon the ipsilateral
lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of herniation. The
ambient cisterns are present and not effaced. There is no slow
diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
On series 12, image 388, there is a subtle enhancing lesion in
the right centrum semiovale. This could represent a small
vascular anomaly as opposed to metastatic lesion, given the
absence of adjacent edema. This is separate from the region of
hemorrhage. There is no enhancement in the region of the
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION: There is no enhancement in the region of hemorrhage
to indicate that this is from a metastasis.
Small lesion in the right centrum semiovale could be consistent
with a small vascular anomaly versus (less likely) a small
metastasis.
No acute infarcts.

Repeat Head CT [**2158-2-2**]:
Increasing edema since [**2158-1-28**]. Otherwise similar appearance of
large right cerebral hemisphere intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

Repeat Head CT [**2158-2-4**]:
Overall no significant interval change in size of right large
cerebral hemisphere intraparenchymal hemorrhage and associated
mass effect since [**2158-2-2**].

EEG [**2158-2-7**]:
ABNORMALITY #1: A [**3-16**] Hz slow and disorganized background rhythm
was
noted in the waking state, which increased by [**12-13**] Hz with
external
stimulation.
ABNORMALITY #2: The right hemisphere background activity was 1
Hz slower
and of decreased amplitude compared to the left hemisphere
activity.
ABNORMALITY #3: Bursts of generalized moderate amplitude delta
slowing
was noted in the waking state.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to patient's mental
status.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the
record.
SLEEP: No normal sleep/wake transitions were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: An irregularly irregular rhythm was noted, with
an
average rate of 96 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the slow,
disorganized
background rhythm, decreased voltage over the right hemisphere
and
bursts of generalized slowing. The slow and disorganized
background
rhythm and bursts of generalized slowing suggest a moderate
encephalopathy. The decreased voltage and slightly slower
background
over the right hemisphere suggests right hemisphere subcortical
dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo man with metastatic cancer presenting as a transfer from an
OSH with new left hemiparesis, decreased alertness, plts <100k,
and a right frontal hemorrhage. Most
likely etiology is hemorrhage from a metastasis in the setting
of thrombocytopenia, though he has no known metastasis there.
Other etiologies include hypertension (though he has not been
terribly hypertensive, his BP does not have to be that high,
especially with the thrombocytopenia, to bleed), hemorrhagic
conversion of stroke; unlikely to be amyloid, trauma, or
vascular malformation. He had an MRI for further evaluation; it
did not clearly demonstrate an underlying metastasis, though it
did show a small lesion in the right centrum semiovale that
might be a metastasis. He was started on decadron and mannitol
and transfused two more packs of platelets to reach goal
plts>100k. Neuro-oncology was consulted. As his repeat head CT
showed significant edema, the decadron was tapered only to 4mg
q12hrs and he was discharged on this dose, to remain stable
until his follow up appointment with neuro-oncology. The
mannitol was weaned off. Gi
