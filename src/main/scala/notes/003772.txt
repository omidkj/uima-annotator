Chief Complaint:
unresponsivenss, shortness of breath



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with no prior h/o afib BIBA to ED today with worsening
shortness of breath and new onset a-fib with RVR. Per NH notes
and report, pt has had a cough and decreased appetite which led
to increasing unresponsive over the weekend. A CXR was performed
on [**2-7**] that showed slight RLL atelectasis and the pt was given
duonebs and robitussin. Today, the pt was noted to be more SOB
with O2 sats 88% on 2L NC.

In the ED, T 99.0, BP 101/94 --> 88/76, HR 160s, RR 28, O2 sat
86% NRB. She was noted to be in afib to the 160s with SBPs in
the 80s. As the pt was DNR/DNI, which was confirmed by her son
and HCP, she was fluid bolused with 500ccs, given amiodarone 150
mg IV X 1, and started on an amiodarone gtt. Her SBPs
subsequently came up to the 90s; however, the pt appeared to be
in greater respiratory distress. She was placed on BIPAP FiO2
100% 8/5 without much improvement in her respiratory status and
with O2 sats remaining in the mid 80's. A CXR was not
significant for acute cardiopulmonary processes. She was
transferred urgently to the MICU for further management.

EKG: (poor baseline) afib c RVR @ 137 bpm, LAD, nl intervals,
unable to appreciate ST elevations or depression [**3-14**]

Imaging:
CXR: [**Month/Day (2) **] supine frontal chest radiograph is reviewed without

comparison. The lungs are grossly clear aside from scarring or
atelectasis in the right mid lung. There are no effusions. The
heart and mediastinal contours are remarkable for a calcified
and tortuous aorta. The perceived widened mediastinum is likely
secondary to mediastinal fat. Note is made of a skinfold
overlying the left upper lung that should not be confused for
pneumothorax. Degenerative changes are noted throughout the
thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F admitted with increasing unresponsiveness, elevated
