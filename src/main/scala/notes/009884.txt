[**2183-5-2**] - CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis - . Moderate bilateral pleural
effusions with consolidation of the posterior lower lobes and
right middle lobe, consistent with aspiration. 2. Reflux of oral
contrast from the stomach to the mid thoracic esophagus.
Elevation of the head of the patient's bed is suggested to
prevent further
aspiration. 3. Moderate to large amount of free intraperitoneal
gas, may be due to prior esophageal intubation and leakage at
site of percutaneous gastrostomy. Clinical evaluation of
gastrostomy continence is suggested. Evaluation for bowel
perforation is limited by lack of opacification with oral
contrast, but no definite evidence of this is identified. 4.
Ascites.
5. Multiple small retroperitoneal paraaortic lymph nodes,
measuring up to 8 mm.
.
[**2183-5-2**] - CT Abdomen - 1. Abnormal segmental thickening of the
sigmoid colon wall. Differential possibilities include ischemic
colitis or infective or inflammatory colitis, clinical
correlation advised. No evidence of perforation or colonic
pneumatosis. 2. Some free intra-abdominal air in the right upper
quadrant could be explained by the presence of percutaneous
gastrostomy tube. 3. Small bibasilar effusions and moderate
associated bibasilar atelectasis, generalized subcutaneous edema
and small-to-moderate amount of intra-abdominal
fluid.
.
[**2183-5-5**] - US LOWER EXT- Patent right SFA to peroneal bypass with
no evidence of stenosis.
.
[**2183-5-9**]- Renal U/S -  Both kidneys are normal in size and
echogenicity without hydronephrosis or masses, the right kidney
measures 11.5 cm in length, the left kidney measures 11.3 cm. In
the right kidney, there are two nonobstructing stones measuring
5 and 7 mm located in the lower and interpole collecting system.
In the left kidney, there is a 4 mm nonobstructing stone in the
interpole collecting system. The bladder is minimally distended
with Foley catheter in its lumen. Mild
quantity of perihepatic free fluid is seen.
.
[**2183-5-19**]: Bilateral LE noninvasive:
1. No occlusive thrombus identified within the right superficial
femoral to popliteal vein, and throughout the left lower
extremity. A small nonocclusive thrombus cannot be ruled out.
2. Right common femoral vein is not completely assessed.
3. Bilateral venous waveforms are consistent with right heart
failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
68M with hx of diaphragmatic dysfunction, DM, CKD, CAD admitted
with hypotension, resp failure
.
#Septic shock: Pt was initially started on broad spectrum
antibiotics and required pressors for several days for blood
pressure support. [**Last Name (un) **] stim was appropriate.  Further workup
revealed a zosyn-resistant pseudomonal pneumonia as well as C.
difficile infection. His antibiotics were changed to Meropenem
and Flagyl and he received a full 14 day course of each.  His
blood pressure meds were held given his low BP with aggressive
diuresis.  Goal MAP of >65.
.
# Hypoxic resp failure:  Likely due to pseudomonal pneumonia
which lead to ARDS.  Over his ICU stay, pt was not able to be
weaned [**12-26**] high PEEP requirements.  On hospital day #15, his
pressure support and PEEP were weaned and he was extubated.
However, over the course of the day, the pt's pCO2 rose from 40
to 60mmHg and he developed resp distress.  He was placed on
BiPAP with moderate improvement in his pCO2.  After two days on
and off BiPAP, pt and family agreed that given his tenuous
respiratory status, he should be reintubated.  He was
reintubated on HD #17 and then trached on HD #22.  He was doing
well on [**3-28**] with 50% FiO2 on discharge.  Of note, pt requires
aminute ventilation of at least [**11-5**] and desaturates with very
little activity.  He will continue his albuterol and atrovent
inhalers QID.
.
# Pleural effusion: Due to volume overload, pt noted to have
large pleural effusions.  A thoracentesis was performed on the
right side on HD #20 and 140cc of serous fluid was removed.  The
fluid was transudative and cultures were negative.
.
# Abd free air: Pt was found to have free air on his CT abdomen.
 Surgery was consulted and given the absence of evidence of
perforation on CT, there was no indication for surgical
intervention.  They thought his free air was most consistent
with esophageal intubation / having a PEG tube.
.
# CRI/Acute Renal Failure: Baseline cr of 1.3 per prior notes.
On admission, Cr up to 4.2.  FeNa indicated that pt was
pre-renal and likely ATN also contributed.  Renal was consulted
when pt started becoming overloaded limiting extubation.  He was
started on lasix and diuril to which he responded well to.
Creatinine stablized around 2.4-2.5 on discharge.
.
# CV:
** rhythm: pt had occasional runs of NSVT while in the ICU.
This was thought to be [**12-26**] the dopamine.  He had no further runs
when off pressors.
** Pump: EF 45-55%; severely volume overloaded.  Pt was on a
lasix drip with diuril towards the end of his ICU stay and he
should continue to receive large doses of diuril and IV lasix
during his rehab stay with the goal of [**11-24**].5L
