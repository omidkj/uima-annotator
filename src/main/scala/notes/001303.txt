Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim / Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3624**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for PEG placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of left subclavian central line (removed), and right
internal jugular central line (removed)

Right sided thoracentesis for pleural effusions


History of Present Illness:
61 year-old male with longstanding DM type 1 with triopathy,
status post CRT [**2196**] (baseline creat 2.9-3.0 in [**3-/2203**]),
recurrent UTIs with MDR organisms, history of MRSA sepsis/osteo,
initially transferred on [**10-17**] from [**Hospital3 2737**] for PEG
placement.
*
He was originally admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2203-10-4**] with mental
status changes. His w/u was remarkable for VRE UTI (only 1000
colonies) and a LLL pneumonia. He was initially started on
Cefepime, changed to Imipenem and Flagyl. A repeat urine culture
grew Burkholderia cepacia sensitive to Zosyn, and Zosyn therapy
was initiated on [**10-12**]. Blood cx negative. A follow-up CXR
showed resolution of his LLL pneumonia. A tagged WBC scan was
also performed and negative for infection. He remained
disoriented despite treatment of his infection, and he was felt
to be continually scratching his left biceps and having facial
twitching. Neurology was consulted. Head CT showed mild atrophy
but was otherwise negative. MRI showed marked atrophy, as well
as subtle changes in the posterior limb of the internal capsule
that could possibly represent small subacute punctate infarcts.
EEG was requested, but deferred [**12-29**] "scheduling difficulties".
Per neurology, Mr. [**Known lastname 1001**] was loaded with Dilantin for possible
seizure activity, with some subsequent improvement in his mental
status.
*
Still at the OSH, his Hct on admission was noted to be 25, and
he was transfused 2 units of PRBCs. He failed a bedside swallow
evaluation, and a barium swallow showed evidence of penetration
and aspiration. An NGT was placed. The patient reportedly did
not want a PEG tube, but was deemed incompetent to make
decisions by psychiatry. While in the hospital, he was begun on
Risperdal and Celexa was increased.
*
On the day of transfer ([**10-17**]), his lab work was remarkable for
a HCO3 drop 20-->15, with development of an anion gap acidosis.
He was started on IVF with dextrose, and given 1 amp of sodium
bicarbonate.  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was hemodynamically
stable. However, his initial lab work was remarkable for an
anion gap of 22, with HCO3 of 9, glucose of 362. ABG done
7.23/22/50 (?arterial). U/A positive for ketones.  Of note,
standing insulin had been held at outside hospital.  He was
given insulin SC X few doses, then started on insulin drip on
the floor on [**10-18**], along with IVF, with eventual closure of his
gap. Coincident with the metabolic derangements, however, he was
noted to have declining mental status (responsive only to pain
at time of transfer), and he was transferred to the MICU for
further care.
*
In the MICU, he was continued on the insulin drip overnight,
discontinued on [**10-19**] at 1000 after overlap with NPH. AG closed.
[**Last Name (un) **] consulted, with recommendation to start Lantus. Regarding
his mental status, neurology was consulted. LP was performed
with OP 9, WBC 4, RBC 0, TP 93, Gluc 145, gram stain negative,
cryptococcal antigen negative, cultures pending. He was loaded
with Dilantin on [**10-18**] at night pending EEG on [**10-19**].
Preliminary report negative for seizure activity. Per neurology,
Dilantin was tapered off.

[**Hospital1 18**]:
[**10-18**] CXR: Probable bibasilar pneumonia
[**10-18**] Renal transplant U/S: Normal
[**10-19**] CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage. No major vascular
territorial infarction.
[**10-19**] EEG: Bursts of generalized slowing consistent with
encephalopathy. .
[**10-20**] MRI with gadolinium, stroke protocol: Mild-to-moderate
brain atrophy and a chronic lacune in the posterior limb of the
left internal capsule unchanged from the previous MRI of [**2202-3-31**].
There are no MRI signs of posterior encephalopathy seen. No mass
effect or hydrocephalus noted. No acute infarcts are seen.
[**10-24**] EGD: Gastric antrum, mucosal biopsy - negative for H.
pylori
[**10-27**] CT sinuses: No air-fluid levels to suggest acute
sinusitis. Mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses, as
described.
[**10-28**] V/Q Scan: Indeterminate lung scan. There are bilateral
areas of decreased perfusion within the lung bases,
asymmetrically with a larger defect on the right. Although the
pattern of this perfusion could be explained by bilateral
pleural effusion, in the face of these abnormalities, it is
difficult to exclude a pulmonary embolism.
[**10-31**] CT Chest without contrast: 1. Large bilateral pleural
effusions with associated compressive atelectasis that are
little changed when compared to [**2202-4-18**]. Otherwise, clear
lungs.  2. Slightly dilated esophagus  3. Dilatation of the
extrahepatic biliary system with a probable calcified filling
defect in the distal common duct. Clinical correlation is
advised.




Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 61 yo male with longstanding DM type 1 with
triopathy, s/p CRT in [**2196**] on immunosuppression, transferred
from OSH with UTI, change in mental status, in DKA. DKA
resolved. Also being anticoagulated for left DVT, likely PE.
Moderate to large pleural effusions bilaterally s/p right
thoracentesis.  Pt has had chronic complaints of chest pain x >1
month, with negative work-ups, pain likely due to combination of
costochondritis plus possible PE.  Pt also with UGIB,
esophagitis, duodenitis, duodenal ulcer not actively bleeding,
and Hct stable on anticoagulation. Treated for UTI with Zosyn,
however, pt found to have new UTI during admission with fever,
which was treated w/ Meropenem.
*
1) PE/DVT/Chest pain:
- Pt complaining of chest pain which he reports to have had for
greater than 1 month, pleuritic or with exertion.  EKGs showed
no changes from baseline, no ischemic changes. He had elevated
cardiac enzymes, which were felt to be secondary to his poor
renal clearance in addition to possible demand ischemia as they
were drawn during a period of anemia/UGIB.  He had lower
extremity dopplers which were positive for DVT in l
