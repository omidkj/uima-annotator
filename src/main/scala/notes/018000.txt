Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5266**]
Chief Complaint:
Fluid overload

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 73 yo female w/ pmhx DM, HTN, PVD, afib, hyperlipidemia,
ESRD on HD who presents today with acute shortness of breath. Pt
was last dialyzed on wednesday and she reports that was given
back all of the fluid that was taken off. Per dialysis nurse she
is actually below her dry weight. Last night she reports waking
up feeling palpatations and sob when laying on her side, no LE
edema although she has b/l BKAs. At that point had no
diaphoresis, cp, nausea or vomiting. Patient reports eating
cheese and crackers and having chinese for dinner last night. No
changes to her medications that she knows of. Pt denies URI
symptoms, fever, chills, cough, cp, abd pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea. She occasionally has constipation.
.
EMS had a difficult time getting an O2 sat and placed her on
cpap and brought her to the ED whree she was weaned to 4 liters
nasal cannula. She received 1 sl nitro. On exam in ED, she was
noted to have crackles on lung exam and she received Asa 325 mg
x 1, 100 IV lasix and she put out 400 cc which per patient made
her feel better. Renal was consulted and recommended emergent
dialysis in the ICU. She was also placed on nitro gtt because
her initial blood pressure in ED was 210/104 and pressures is
now down to 150/80s. EKG showed st elevation V1-V4 c/w prior ekg
and recent prior cath 8 days ago was negative.
.
Of note, she had a recent admission to [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] with acute dyspnea
and fluid overload and was dialyzed emergently there. She was
then transferred from osh with elevated troponins and negative
stress test to [**Hospital1 18**]. Pt had coronary catheterization which
showed patent arteries at [**Hospital1 **] last week. She was thought to have
elevated troponins in setting of renal failure and demand
ischemia with aflutter. She underwent caval-isthmus atrial
flutter ablation which was unsuccessful and she was put on
coumadin and rate controlled.
.
In the ICU, patient's initial vs were: T 97.4, HR 81, BP 124/62,
R 23, O2 sat 100% on 4 l nc. She felt much better after the
lasix given in the ED. Denied dizziness, cp, palp, sob, abd
pain, nausea, etc.

AP PORTABLE CHEST: Dual-lumen catheter via right internal
jugular approach terminates near the cavoatrial junction. Heart
size is normal. Aorta is tortuous. The interstitial markings are
prominent and multiple peripheral septal lines are noted. Both
costophrenic sulci are blunted. There is no pneumothorax or
focal airspace consolidation. The bones are somewhat
demineralized.

IMPRESSION: Interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural
effusions.

[**2163-1-21**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Q waves in leads V1-V2
with poor
R wave progression. Suggest old anteroseptal myocardial
infarction.
Borderline left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave
abnormalities, most likely related to secondary repolarization
abnormalities from left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2163-1-11**] there is no significant diagnostic
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 73 yo female with pmhx afib s/p failed ablation on
coumadin, htn, hyperlipidemia, DM and ESRD on HD who presented
with acute dyspnea and pulmonary edema, treated in the MICU with
urgent dialysis, called out to the floor on HD#2 euvolemic.

#. Dyspnea - Resolved quickly with hemodialysis, likely
secondary to volume overload from being underdialyzed and
dietary non-complaince. No evidence of PNA on admission CXR,
with resolved leukocytosis and afebrile. Anticoagulated so PE is
unlikely.
She was discharged to continue her dialysis on regular M/W/F
schedule.  Patient was educated about a low salt, heart healthy
diet.

#. HTN- Patient hypertensive to 200s when she came to ED and was
started on nitro gtt. On admission to MICU, SBP 120s and
nitroglycerin gtt was quickly weaned off. This episode is likely
secondary to fluid overload and sob [**1-22**] fluid overload. Patient
was normotensive on transfer to the floor and remained
normotensive on the day of discahrge.  She was discharged on her
home regimen with the uptitration of her beta blocker to
continue dialysis regimen as above.

#. ESRD- On dialysis M/W/F. Per report, patient was under
dialyzed on wednesday, two days prior to admission, because she
was under her dry weight.  She received HD on the evening of
admission emergently and was sent home to continue HD on M/W/F
when she was euvolemic. The renal followed during her stay and
we continued sevelemer and nephrocaps.  On the day of discharge,
patient was mildly hyperkalemic and received kayxalate prior to
discharge with plan for HD on the morning following discharge.

#. Leukocytosis- Patient's [**Known lastname **] count 18.8 on admission with no
localizing signs of infection or fever. [**Month (only) 116**] be stress related.
Resolved on transfer to the floor. Urine culture negative on
admission. Blood cultures x2 with no growth to date still
pending at time of discharge.

#. PAF- S/P failed ablation last admission on warfarin. INR
supratherapeutic on admission at 4.4. Her warfarin was held as
INR was supratherapeutic and resumed on discharge once INR fell
into therapeutic range.  She was continued on metoprolol with
uptitration to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and diltiazem at home dose for rate
control. Telemetry showed continued paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation during her stay.

#. Hyperlipidemia- Continued simvastatin 80 mg qd.

#. PVD- continued aspirin.

#. DM - Most recent A1c in [**11-27**] was 6.9. She was maintained on
NPH 16 units qam as per home regimen.  QACHS finger sticks with
sliding scale coverage and diabetic diet were provide
