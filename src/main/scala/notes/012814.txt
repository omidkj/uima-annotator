Admission Date: [**2166-7-21**]        Discharge Date: [**2166-7-23**]


Service:  MED


The patient was in the Fenard ICU.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease status post right
coronary stent, deep venous thrombosis, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
abdominal aortic aneurysm, peptic ulcer disease, hypertension
presenting from [**Hospital3 2558**] with confusion, hematemesis,
and high white count.  The patient was recently admitted from
[**2166-2-6**] to [**2166-2-14**] for a right hip open reduction
internal fixation status post a fall.  He was also treated
with Levofloxacin from [**2166-7-15**] to [**2166-7-22**] for presumed
urinary tract infection.  On admit he complained of several
bouts of diarrhea over the past few days prior to admission
as well as fevers and chills.  He has a history of recurrent
aspiration pneumonia but did not complain of a cough.

The day prior to admit he complained of abdominal pain
diffusely with bloody emesis times one concurrent with a
nosebleed.  The morning of admission he was found to be
diaphoretic, pale, and his white count was elevated to 34.
In the Emergency Department he received vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and Flagyl empiric.  His hematocrit was found to
be 29 and decreased to 17.  After one unit of packed red
cells it was improved to 26.  He was guaiac negative and
trace guaiac positive brown stool.  Nasogastric lavage was
clear with flecks of blood.  Chest x-ray was negative.
Abdominal CT showed no acute process.  His systolic blood
pressure in the Emergency Department dropped to the 80s which
was responsive to intravenous fluid boluses.  His heart rate
also transiently decreased to the 40s with an atrial
arrhythmia.  He was given two liters of normal saline as well
as two units of packed red cells.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON ADMIT:  His white count was
34.5, hematocrit 29, 17, and then 26, INR 1.3, BUN 67,
creatinine 1.8, anion gap 15, cardiac enzymes negative times
three, haptoglobin normal.  Urinalysis showed positive
nitrites, moderate bacteria, trace leukocyte esterase, 11 to
20 white blood cells, 0 red blood cells, lactate 6 and on
repeat 2.2.

CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed bibasilar atelectasis
with relative sparing of subpleural region.  Abdominal aortic
aneurysm unchanged to prior study.

Chest x-ray:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

EKG in Emergency Department during a bout of hypotension
showed [**Street Address(2) **] depressions anterolaterally with resolution
of depressions on the floor.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  Hematemesis:  The patient was
transfused a total of four units of packed red blood cells
and continued to have a stable hematocrit checked every six
hours.  EGD was done by Gastroenterology which showed no
active bleeding and was consistent with erosive esophagitis.
He was continued on Protonix 40 mg q.d.  Likely, his
hematemesis was secondary to his episode of epistaxis the day
prior to admit.  H. pylori is pending.

Infectious Disease:  Patient's white count was 34 on admit.
He had low-grade temperatures to 99 and 100 degrees
Fahrenheit.  He was started empirically on a course of p.o.
Flagyl to cover for Clostridium difficile as the patient was
recently on Levofloxacin and complained of diarrhea prior to
admit.  His urinalysis was also a positive.  On admit he was
started on ceftriaxone as well as vancomycin.  This was
switched to Bactrim before discharge.  Cultures are pending.

Deep venous thrombosis:  The patient has a history of a deep
venous thrombosis in [**3-/2166**] on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2
to 3.  He was given two doses of vitamin K at [**Hospital3 2558**]
before transfer.  His INR on admit was 1.3.  As the patient
could not be anticoagulated on the first night, inferior vena
cava filter was placed and after the normal EGD, his Coumadin
was resumed.

Pulmonary:  The patient is on Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers.  He was 7 to 8 liters positive during the course
of this stay and mildly fluid overloaded.  He required two
liters oxygen by nasal cannula and responded well to Lasix
during his diastolic cardiac dysfunction.  He will be
discharged on 20 mg p.o. q.d.

Renal:  Patient's creatinine improved to baseline and anion
gap resolved, likely from a non-gap metabolic acidosis from
his prior diarrhea.

Coronary artery disease status post stent:  He was continued
on his aspirin and Plavix.

Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient's diet was
advanced and he tolerated it well before discharge.

Contact:  Wife.

Full Code.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged back to [**Hospital3 7511**] for continued rehabilitation after his open reduction
internal fixation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Good.
