Admission Date: [**2167-5-8**]        Discharge Date: [**2167-5-21**]


Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year old
female with a chief complaint of abdominal pain, possibly
secondary to an IM Lovenox injection. The patient has a
pertinent past medical history of atrial fibrillation with a
St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mitral valve and has recently been admitted for a
labile INR and is now on Lovenox. She was well until 8 p.m.
the day prior to admission when one hour after Lovenox
administration, she developed severe abdominal pain. She
presented to the ER for further evaluation. The pain is
constant and bilateral without radiation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems shows no fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting and no weight loss recently. The
patient does report anorexia and flatus with a normal bowel
movement yesterday.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Sick sinus syndrome with pacemaker.
2.  Ventricular tachycardia.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Embolic CVA.
8.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
9.  Possible past GI bleeding.
10. Normal EGD and colonoscopy in [**2165-11-8**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude's valve.
2. Status post right total hip replacement.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lovenox 60 mg [**Hospital1 **].
2. Lopressor 37.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
3. Amiodarone 200 mg qd.
4. Zocor.
5. Proton pump inhibitor (unknown which one).
6. Lasix 20 mg qd.
7. Colace.
8. Senna.
9. Aspirin 81 mg po qd.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 98.3, heart rate was
60 (paced rhythm), blood pressure 123/35, respirations 18 and
oxygen saturation 6 percent on room air.  General - looks
uncomfortable. HEENT - no scleral icterus, oropharynx clear.
Chest - decreased breath sounds at bases. Cardiac - regular
rate and rhythm (paced rhythm). Abdomen - distended centrally
with the greatest tenderness centrally. There is some
guarding and percussive tenderness, no hernias. Extremities -
venous stasis changes, palpable pedal pulses bilaterally.
Rectal - guaiac negative, no masses.

LABS AND STUDIES:  White blood cell count is 10, hematocrit
27, platelets 226, sodium 141, potassium 5.9, chloride 105,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 34, creatinine 1.1, glucose 121. PTT is
37.3, INR 1.1, AST 25, ALT 17, alkaline phosphatase 61, total
bilirubin 1, amylase 102, lipase 23.

Chest x-ray - no pneumoperitoneum, possible retrocardiac
infiltrate.

CT of abdomen showed a right rectus sheath hematoma which
extravasates into the peritoneal cavity causing the
hemoperitoneum. Some layering of blood around the liver could
represent a subcapsular hematoma. Also seen is massive
cardiomegaly, patchy atelectasis with aspiration or
consolidation of the right lower lobe and multiple gallstones
within the gallbladder.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and taken to the
OR urgently.  In the OR, the patient was found to have
hemoperitoneum with a right rectus sheath hematoma and
epigastric vessel laceration. The patient underwent an
exploratory laparotomy with omentectomy and abdominal wall
repair. The patient tolerated the procedure and went to the
PACU in fair condition. Please see dictated operative note
for further details. The patient required three units of
packed red blood cells intraoperatively and postoperatively
had a hematocrit of 29. The patient was kept intubated and
sedated until later on postoperative day 1. The patient was
started on an amiodarone drip due to a period of sinus
tachycardia immediately postop. The patient had cardiac
enzymes drawn and ruled out for an MI. In the PACU, the
patient received an additional unit of packed red blood cells
which brought her hematocrit up to 34.4. The patient's
Lovenox was held until postop day 3 at which time it was
begun without incident. During this period, the patient had
no other form of anticoagulation for fear of a recurrence of
the hematoma and bleeding. This decision was made in
conjunction with Cardiology. On postoperative day 2, the
patient had a temperature to 101.3. Blood cultures were drawn
which came back negative. The patient's wound was clean, dry
and intact with no erythema. The patient was diuresed over
the first five postoperative days and the patient's heart
rate was controlled with periodic metoprolol boluses and
modification of the amiodarone drip. The patient was
transferred to the floor on postoperative day 5 after having
received another unit of packed red blood cells, bringing her
hematocrit up to 33.1. The patient was maintained on an
amiodarone drip and received nothing orally due to her
ongoing lack of bowel function. On examination, her abdomen
was somewhat firm, diffusely tender with slight tympany
throughout. This was unchanged from postop. On postop day 6,
due to an ongoing ileus, the patient was started on TPN. A
KUB showed no signs of obstruction. On postoperative day 7,
the patient was noted to have slight swelling of her left
hand and forearm. However, she had normal grip strength,
normal pulses and sensation. She was continued on Lovenox and
this swelling later resolved. The patient was continued on
TPN throughout which was ultimately advanced to a goal of 210
by the time of her discharge.  The patient's abdominal exam
continued relatively unchanged with right-sided firmness and
guarding with right greater than left tenderness with no
rebound. By the time of the patient's discharge, the patient
was reporting flatus and was tolerating a regular diet
without nausea or vomiting. However, she was unable to meet
her caloric needs and therefore the patient was sent out on
TPN. The patient was transitioned over to all oral
medications including oral amiodarone without difficulty. Her
metoprolol was increased from 37.5 to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] for some
periods of tachycardia. The patient remained afebrile for the
remainder of her hospital stay and had a somewhat rhonchorous
lung exam. However, she was unable to produce sputum and, as
stated previously, did not spike a fever. On postoperative
day 11, a PICC line was placed to facilitate TPN as an
outpatient. A chest x-ray on that same day showed poly-
chamber cardiomegaly with bibasilar atelectasis and blunting
of costophrenic angles but this was relatively unchanged from
previous chest x-rays. There was no infiltrate noted. The
patient was also seen a second time by Cardiology for
tachycardia and a wide complex QRS. It was determined that
this did not constitute VTACH as the rhythm was irregular but
was instead simply atrial fibrillation with a wide complex.
There was also some question about the functioning of the
pacer but Cardiology pointed out that the pacing in question
was according to function and was what is known as "safety
pacing." No interrogation of the pacer was indicated.  The
patient was therefore discharged to a rehab facility with the
plan to slowly wean the patient from TPN as her PO intake
picked up.
