HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year old female
with relapsed suboptimally debulked stage III ovarian
carcinosarcoma with a residual mass in the mesentery of the
sigmoid, status post multiple medical therapies (currently on
Taxotere) who is admitted from clinic on [**2108-5-7**] with
neutropenia, nausea, and vomiting - but no fevers.

Her laboratories were notable for a white blood cell count of
1 with a granulocyte count of 230.  Her sodium was 130.
Calcium was 7.5.  Albumin was 2.3.  A chest x-ray was
negative for pneumonia.  Abdominal x-ray showed no
obstruction.

In the clinic, the patient was found to be hypotensive to the
80s and was given 1 liter of normal saline.  The patient was
difficult to obtain a history from but stated she had nausea
and vomiting for one month and had tried to gain further
fluid intake.  She notes that she felt dizzy in the morning
with standing.  She also complained of paresthesias times one
year.  No pain now.  Vomited three times today.  Her last
bowel movement was today.  Her review of systems is negative
for a cough, diarrhea, and dysuria.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Ovarian cancer diagnosed in [**2106-11-21**]; status post Taxol and carboplatin times six with
excellent results.  CEA125 in the 50s.  Then Arimidex in
[**2106**].  Five cycles of Doxil after presenting with progressive
disease and asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary
embolism on restaging computer tomography.  Two cycles of
gemcitabine and one cycle of topotecan which was poorly
tolerated.  She is status post one cycle of carboplatin with
an anaphylactic reaction and is now status post two cycles of
Taxotere.

Asymptomatic pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis in
[**2107-5-22**].

Thrombophlebitis.

Esophageal polyp.

Lumpectomy.

Status post right hand surgery.

Dilatation and curettage in the [**2073**].

3. Percocet.
4. Ativan.
5. Diflucan.
6. Motrin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  She has a 45-pack-year
history of smoking.  She denies alcohol use.  She is a former
banker and receptionist.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother died of a cerebrovascular
accident at the age of 52.  Her father died of lung cancer at
the age of 77.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 95.5,
her heart rate was 75, her respiratory rate was 18, her blood
pressure was 77/48, and her oxygen saturation was 97 percent
on room air.  In general,  lying in bed in no acute distress.
Alert and oriented times three.  The mucous membranes were
dry.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate with
a systolic murmur.  The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  There were positive bowel sounds.  No rebound
or guarding.  Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  Skin revealed no rashes.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  HYPOTENSION:  The patient
was initially admitted to the Oncology Service but she
remained hypotensive on the floor.  Fluid boluses were tried,
and her blood pressure did not come up.

She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  There, her
blood pressure labored in the 80s and 90s with fluid
challenges.  She eventually did require a pressor.  Also, in
the setting of intubation (please see below), it was felt
that partially septic due to an pneumonia.  She was covered
with cefepime and azithromycin, and fluid resuscitation
continued.  The patient's hypotension never did resolve on
pressors.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Initially, when the patient presented
she was comfortable from a respiratory standpoint, but her
respiratory status declined.  She became hypoxic and required
intubation.  She was successfully intubated, but we were
unable to wean the ventilator and the patient was alert
enough when she was not sedated to express that she did not
appreciate being on the ventilator.  Her husband and her sons
were involved in the decision making and agreed that she
would not desire a prolonged intubation, and we discussed
with the family that her prognosis was quite poor and her
chance of recovery only would be after a long intubation and
long rehabilitation.

After that discussion on [**2108-5-10**] the decision was made
to make the patient comfort measures only and to withdraw the
dilatory support.  This was done, and the patient passed away
on [**2108-5-11**].

PULMONARY EMBOLISM AND DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS:  The patient
was anticoagulated with Coumadin.  When she presented, her
INR was 4.4.  She was reversed with fresh frozen plasma for
line placement.

ONCOLOGY:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 150**], the patient's primary
oncologist, was involved in discussions throughout and in the
discussion which ended in the decision to withdraw care.

TACHYCARDIA:  The patient was felt to be in paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation versus multifocal atrial tachycardia.  In any
case, given the goals of care she was not medically treated
for this.

DATE OF DEATH:  [**2108-5-11**].
