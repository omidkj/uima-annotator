Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
Right subdural collection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right craniotomy for evacuation of right subdural
abscess/empyema.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of shunt and
revision in the past. About 2 to 3 months ago, the patient had a
shunt infection and the whole
shunt was removed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. However, at that point, the
subdural collection was left intact. The patient was given
antibiotics for long-term. The patient followed up with me, and
he had a CAT scan as well as an MRI. Initially, the patient
refused the proposed surgery due to my suspicion that
this was representing an abscess. He continued with antibiotic
treatment. However, the patient started to deteriorate
neurologically, with difficulty with speech and also weakness of
the left side. An MRI showed enhancement of
that collection with what seemed to be a very thick membrane.
Then finally, the patient agreed to surgery.

Past Medical History:

flow. RCA was occluded in the mid segment and could not be
engaged but was filled with left-right callaterals.

Pertinent Results:
CTH [**11-6**]
1. New right inferior frontal lobe intraparenchymal hematoma
2. Status post drainage of right frontal subdural collection
with expected postoperative changes. Right lenticular hypodense
collection has resolved. Mild amount of right subdural hematoma
remains. Left subdural hematoma is unchanged.

CTH [**11-8**]
 Stable right intraparenchymal hematoma. Stable left subdural
hematoma.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Neurosurgery service s/p right
craniotomy for treatment and diagnosis of a right subdural
collection which was found to be a right subdural abscess.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well with an EBL of 400.  For
further detail of the procedure please refer to the operative
note.  He was en route back to the PACU post operatively when he
had atonic clonic seizure, loaded with dilantin and admitted to
the SICU for monitoring.  On POD1, subdural JP drain was d/c'd
without complication.  The POD2 CTH was stable and the patient
was transfered out of the SICU to stepdown on POD 3.  ID was
consulted and managed pt with vanco and ceftaz until cultures
were back.  A PICC line was placed [**1-23**] difficult access and the
initial thought that the patient would require long term abx. On
[**11-11**] abx were discontinued. The patient also developed urinary
retention on [**11-11**] and required catheterization.  The patient
had complaints of left shoulder pain that was an acute
exacerbation of his chronic shoulder pain.  Xrays revealed no
fracture or dislocation.  Ortho was consulted and recommended
outpatient treatment of shoulder pain.  Physical therapy
recommended rehab.  On [**11-14**], the picc line was dislodged and
subsequent xray showed slight proximal migration of catheter
tip.  Upon discharge to rehab, the patient is afebrile with all
vitals stable, tolerating po feeds, with impaired strength and
balance, and with pain controlled on po pain medication.
