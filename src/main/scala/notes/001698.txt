Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Osteomyelitis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT-guided aspiration of right AC joint ([**6-6**]).
L BKA on [**2174-6-8**] and revision of L BKA on [**2174-6-16**]
Right shoulder debriment and joint washout on [**2174-6-8**] and on
[**2174-6-16**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 53-year-old male with past medical history
significant for poorly controlled type II diabetes, known
cardiomyopathy (EF 10-15%), HTN, and CAD who initially presented
to outside hospital on [**5-31**] with AMS, fall at home, and HHNK
requiring an insulin drip for glucose levels up to 591. Also
treated for hyperkalemia to 6.8. Patient is now off of insulin
drip and back on [**Hospital1 **] NPH with humalog SSI.

He was also found to be newly in afib, controlled with diltiazem
drip. He was also treated with carvedilol and lisinopril. He was
temporarily on digoxin, which was reportedly stopped due to
recent hyperkalemia, although appears to have been given on day
of transfer.

The patient has a chronic known left heel osteomyelitis and
ulcer which probes all the way through to the calcaneus and
appeared gangrenous and malodorous with subcutaneous gas on
x-ray. His calcaneus was also shown to be entirely fracture on
x-ray. He was placed on IV Vancomycin/Zosyn and he was seen by
vascular / podiatry teams at OSH who offered amputation there
but family prefers [**Hospital1 18**] podiatry service where patient sees Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] regularly.
??bacteremic with Gram pos cocci

Of note, patient had a debridement on [**6-1**] and likely had an
arterial bleed as he had severe bleeding requiring 4 units PRBCs
and 2 units FFP as well as local torniquets to control bleeding.
He had been on SC heparin for DVT prevention at time of
debridement which was then held. Vascular study showed no
arterial flow abnormalities.
.
He also complained of right sided shoulder pains which triggered
an orthopedic consult. There was concern for septic joint but
imaging revealed no significant fluid to tap. However, there was
evidence of  air in the local subcutaneous tissue around right
shoulder and follow-up CT scan of shoulder showed some evidence
of air in SC tissue as well as air inside shaft of clavicle per
OSH reports.
.
Initial labs were also remarkable for Cr 2.5 but slowly
recovered to Cr 1.07 with IV fluids by time of transfer. Also
noted to have tbili of 2.2, tropT of 0.04.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient's initial  VS were: T 101.2 P 104
BP 133/111 R 29 O2 sat 96%,3L. He remembers going to the
hospital for being confused, but is unclear of the other
details. He currently complains of shoulder pain on the right,
denies foot pain.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged

initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
