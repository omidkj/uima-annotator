History of Present Illness:
DIAGNOSIS:  33-year-old gentleman with relapsed transformed B
cell lymphoma status post autologous stem cell transplant on
[**2155-3-31**], with disease recurrence in 07/[**2155**].

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  The patient initially presented in [**Month (only) 404**]
of
[**2151**] while in [**State **] with an episode of bloody diarrhea,
preceded by syncope. He was taken to a local emergency room and
was evaluated with EGD and colonoscopy which did not reveal a
clear source of the bleeding and no biopsies were taken. A
slight
bulge in the gastric curvature was noted, however, suggesting a
possible intra-abdominal mass. Recommendations were made for
follow-up EGD.

This was performed in [**1-/2154**] at the [**Hospital1 18**] and revealed a healed
linear erosion on the distal esophagus suggestive of a healed
[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear. Recommendations at that time were for no
further followup and to discontinue his proton pump inhibitor.

In [**4-/2154**], he presented with flu-like symptoms and night
sweats.
He also noted decreased appetite and a sensation of bloating and
fullness in his abdomen.  He reported a five to six-pound weight
loss over 1 month and noted a lump in his left abdomen and dull
pain in his lower back.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis at that
time showed a 15 x 14.6 x 10.7 cm mass involving the left upper
quadrant contigous with the pancreas and pressing on the
duodenum
as well as encasing the SMV, although all the vessels were
patent.  He also had retroperitoneal right ileum and left
inguinal lymphadenopathy.

A biopsy later revealed follicular lymphoma Grade II/III,
follicular and diffuse with focal progression to follicular
lymphoma Grade III/III.  The nodular architecture was effaced by
vaguely nodular proliferation of small cleaved cells with a mass
of larger centroblastic cells (10 to 15 per high power field).
Focally, the follicles were composed of sheaths of larger
centroblastic cells consistent with transformation to a high-
grade lymphoma. These cells were positive for CD20 and BCL-2.

He was then treated with six cycles of CHOP and Rituxan.  He had
a significant residual abdominal mass but a PET scan became
negative and was then under observation.  In [**12-27**], he was noted
to have a rising LDH and underwent a repeat PET scan which
showed
uptake in the mediastinum, abdomen, and bright uptake in the
right inguinal region.  Given the patient's transformed
phenotype, he was treated with cytoreduction and MIME
chemotherapy followed by consolidation with high dose
chemotherapy and stem cell rescue.

He then proceeded with MIME chemotherapy x two cycles.  He
tolerated this well and demonstrated evidence of response as
determined by decrease in the size of mediastinal lesion and
decrease in the intensity of PET uptake.  The patient
subsequently underwent high-dose cytoxan for stem cell
mobilization. He was admitted for transplant and preconditioning
chemotherapy high-dose cytoxan, followed by bone marrow
transplant.  He had an autologous stem cell transplant on
[**2155-3-31**]. The patient's transplant course was complicated by
development of pericarditis and pleural effusions of unclear
etiology.

In [**2155-9-24**], he underwent repeat scans which showed some new
adenopathy in the groin and increased uptake in the area as well
as around the large left upper quadrant lesion which has been
stable.  He was treated with Zevalin on [**2155-11-18**].

He had repeat CAT scans done in [**2156-3-25**] which showed
ongoing growth of his lymphoma particularly in the lesion in the
pelvic area.  At that time he got 4 more doses of Rituxan
chemotherapy, followed by [**Hospital1 **].

A CT scan on [**2156-6-9**] which showed that his disease was stable.
He then received ESHAP chemotherapy on [**2156-6-18**], which he
tolerated well.

The patient then got a nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell
transplant with Campath conditioning.  He is approximately Day
+370 from this.  More recently, he received lymphocyte infusions
in late [**2157-1-25**].

Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] was recently admitted on [**2157-3-25**] with an upper
respiratory infection manifested by coryza, cough, and nasal
congestion with fevers to 101 and also associated with a diffuse
macular body rash.  He was just discharged on [**2157-4-1**] but called
us today with a fever up to 101.5 and worsened dry throat, and
loss of voice.  He denies diarrhea or abdominal pain and says
his pruritis is improved from previous.

RUQ U/S: The liver is normal in echo texture and architecture,
without focal masses. Portal venous flow is patent and in the
proper direction. The gallbladder is collapsed. The common
hepatic duct is 2.5 mm. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign was elicited.
.
CXR: No pneumonia.
.
Chest CT: Assessment of the lungs demonstrates mild diffuse
peribronchial wall thickening, best appreciated in the lower
lobes bilaterally, greater on the right side.
.
MRI Abd:
1) No enhancing lesions identified in the liver.
2) No evidence for hepatosplenic candidiasis.
3) No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The
pancreatic duct is normal in appearance.
4) Normal appearance of the pancreas.
.
Liver biopsy ([**5-11**])
1.  Moderate hepatocellular and canalicular cholestasis.
2.  No significant portal or lobular inflammation.
3.  Focal hepatocyte apoptosis and ballooning degeneration.
4.  No viral cytopathic changes immunoreactivity for herpes
simplex virus (HSV)-I, HSV-II, or cytomegalovirus (CMV) seen.
5.  Trichrome stain:  Minimal portal fibrosis.
6.  Extramedullary hematopoiesis.
7.  Iron stain:  Moderate iron deposition, predominantly in
Kupffer cells.
8.  No micro-organisms seen on AFB, GMS, or PAS-D stains.
Note:  There is one focally damaged bile ducts with no
associated inflammation.  This could represent treated graft
versus host disease.
.
MRI Head
Signal abnormalities involving left medial temporal lobe and
left basal ganglia region. Subtle increased signal is seen in
the region of left basal ganglia, which could be due to subtle
enhancement or prominence of the vascular structures. The
differential diagnosis given the patient's clinical history is
suggestive of infection versus neoplasm. The appearances are
more likely to be due to an infectious process.
