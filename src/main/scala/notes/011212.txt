History of Present Illness:
82 year old Greek female with PMH bioprosthetic AVR, CHF in
[**2166**], COPD with CO2 retention, Afib on coumadin presents with
acute shortness of breath. Several days PTA, pt had complaints
of fatigue and decreased appetite. HR was noted to be in the
40s. [**Name (NI) 1094**] son [**Name (NI) 653**] PCP who told her to decrease toprol to
once a day. On [**2169-10-27**], pt didn't take AM dose of toprol and
took [**1-6**] pill at night. On day of admission, pt complained of
SOB @ 2am, again at 3am, gasping for air. 911 was called. On
admission to [**Hospital1 18**], she was found to be in bradycardia in the
20s. She complained of SOB and chest pressure. External pacing
was initiated, but was not capturing well. EKG without pacing
showed complete heart block with p wave rate @100, ventricular
escape @20-25. EP fellow was called. While temporary pacing wire
was being placed, potassium came back at 6.4. For hyperkalemia,
bicarbonate, insulin, and glucose were given. At this point,
pt's intrinsic rate was noted to be in the 40s, with narrower
complex. Unfortunately, no 12 lead EKG obtained. After pacing,
pt was supressed without intrinsic ventricular rate. Pt's SBP
transiently decreased to 90's and was given brief dopamine and
fluids

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. The patient
was sedated for
the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test
Information
section). Local anesthesia was provided by lidocaine spray. No
TEE related
complications. The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation. The
patient is in
a ventricularly paced rhythm. Results were personally reviewed
with the MD
caring for the patient. Results were reviewed with the
Cardiology Fellow
involved with the patient's care. Echocardiographic results were
reviewed with
the houseofficer caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombu
