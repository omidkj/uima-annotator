HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 3444**] is a 53-year-old woman
with multiple medical problems including multiple past
hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
pulmonary hypertension and question of obstructive sleep
apnea and obesity - hypoventilation syndrome who presented to
the Emergency Department from a sleep study with 9 out of 10
pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia to 85% on 15 liters
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  Per her family, the
patient has had a few days of coughing, malaise productive of
yellow sputum prior to admission.  The patient was in the
process of an evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea with a
sleep study on the night prior to admission.  Per report, she
had an impressive sleep study with chronic hypoxia.  On the
morning of admission, she complained of chest pain that was
much worse than her chronic chest pain syndrome and was
graded 9 out of 10.  She was hypoxic to 80% on 6 liters of
oxygen through nasal cannula.  This increased to 90% on a
100% nonrebreather.  She was also tachycardic to the 120s and
had a blood pressure of 160/90.  She was taken to the
Emergency Department where she had a chest x-ray performed
which was consistent with congestive heart failure and she
was treated initially with a nitroglycerin drip, intravenous
heparin and 2 mg of intravenous morphine sulfate to make her
chest pain free and for the possibility of unstable angina.
With the nitroglycerin, her blood pressure decreased to
60/40, thereby the nitroglycerin was turned off and she was
bolused with intravenous fluid with a drop in her blood
pressure to 80/60.

CT angiogram was performed to rule out a pulmonary embolism.
The CT angiogram demonstrated bilateral pneumonia.  At this
point, her mental status began to decline and the patient was
intubated and dopamine was started for blood pressure
support.  At the time of institution of vasopressor therapy,
her blood pressure was 42/38.  She was at that point
transported to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Per report
of her son, she had recently been discharged from pulmonary
rehabilitation three days prior to admission where she had
been following a recent hospitalization to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**3-17**] to [**3-23**] for chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  She is on home
oxygen therapy with 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
She is dependent on chronic inhaled steroids.  Pulmonary
function test in [**2109-6-14**] demonstrated an FVC of 1.98
liters, FEV1 of 1.50 liters and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 101% of
predicted.  The results were interpreted as consistent with a
mild restrictive ventilatory defect with a diffusing capacity
suggestive of an interstitial process.  She also had a
significant increase in lung volumes following bronchodilator
treatment which is suggestive of a concurrent obstructive
process.
2.  Type II diabetes mellitus
3.  Fibromyalgia
4.  Depression
5.  Osteoarthritis
6.  Question rheumatoid arthritis
7.  Chronic chest pain syndrome
8.  Paget's disease
9.  Obstructive sleep apnea
10. Stress test in [**2109**] revealed ability to achieve 80% of
maximum predicted heart rate.  The ejection fraction was
calculated at 66% and there were no regional wall motion
abnormalities.

ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO FLEXERIL, KEFLEX AND ULTRAM.
SHE IS ALSO ALLERGIC TO CODEINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone in [**Hospital1 3494**].  She is
currently unemployed.  She quit tobacco use in [**2094**] and prior
to that smoked a half pack a day for 15 years.  She reports
no ethanol use.  She is a Jehovah's witness.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Not available at the time of admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate 97, blood pressure 89/51 as measured
by an arterial line, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation
95%.
GENERAL:  The patient was an obese African-American female
who was intubated and sedated.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Her pupils were widely
dilated and the sclerae were anicteric.  No jugular venous
distention or lymphadenopathy was present in the neck.
CHEST:  Coarse air movement bilaterally with good air entry.
No wheezes or crackles were appreciated.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with normal first heart sound
and a split second heart sound.  No murmurs were appreciated.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender and nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  There was trace bilateral lower extremity edema
with cool extremities.

DATA:  White count 9.7 with 71% neutrophils, 1% bands, 22%
lymphocytes, hematocrit 40.6, platelets 203, sodium 140,
potassium 5.4, chloride 104, bicarbonate 27, BUN 9,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 161, CK 68, troponin less than 0.3.
PT 16.3, INR 1.9, PTT 36.8.  Arterial lactate 2.5.
Urinalysis done on a catheterized specimen revealed a large
amount of blood with 21 to 50 red blood cells and 3 to 5
white blood cells.  A preintubation arterial blood gases on a
100% nonrebreather revealed a pH of 7.33, PCo2 of 55 and PO2
of 64.  Post intubation arterial blood gases on 100% oxygen
revealed a pH of 7.33, PCo2 of 42 and a PO2 of 77.

IMAGING:  CT examination of the chest revealed extensive
bilateral air space opacities predominantly at the bases.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for management of her bilateral pneumonia
complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension
suggestive of septic physiology.

1.  PULMONARY:  She was intubated on arrival to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  During the course of her Medical
Intensive Care Unit stay, she was treated with inhaled
bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.  The vent
settings were weaned down gradually as her pulmonary status
allowed.  She was extubated on the 13th, 10 days after
initial intubation.  She was extubated successfully without
any post extubation difficulty.  On the day after extubation,
she was transferred to the general medicine floor.  Her
supplemental oxygen requirements at that time were 4 liters
of oxygen via nasal cannula (she is on baseline 2 liters of
oxygen via nasal cannula at home).  After reaching medical
floor, she had a pulmonary consult.  They recommended
continuing her in treatment and performing a sleep study
after several weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation to further
evaluate the extent of her obstructive sleep apnea and
obesity - hypoventilation syndrome.  On the floor, she
received BIPAP.  Her BIPAP settings were IPAP of 16 and EPAP
of 10 with 3 liters of oxygen.  She reported that these BIPAP
settings enabled her to sleep well.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Given her initial hypotension, on
arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit she was started on
a dopamine drip.  She also received free boluses of
intravenous fluid for blood pressure support.  Dopamine drip
was weaned off after four days.  At that point, she was
approximately 7 liters net for the course of her hospital
stay.  She underwent prn diuresis to relieve some of the
total body fluid overload.  This has also helped relieve some
of her pulmonary edema with an improvement in her respiratory
status.  At the time of arrival to the medical floor, she was
approximately 1.5 liters net in for the course of her
hospital day.  She underwent additional prn diuresis on the
floor.  She had good response to intravenous Lasix.  After
being weaned off the dopamine drip maintaining her blood
pressure within a normal range was no longer a problem.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Given her bilateral lower lobe
pneumonia and her recent stay at a rehabilitation facility,
she was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.  She
was initially started on levofloxacin for treatment of
community acquired pneumonia.  However, this antibiotic
therap
