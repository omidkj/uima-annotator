History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 yo man wtih h/o CAD, PVD presented to OSH on
[**2195-7-16**] with confusion and urinary incontinence. Per wife was
having low grade fevers at home prior to admission. he developed
confusion and urinary incont 1 day PTA to OSH. MRI showed
multiple acute strokes in the brain and blood cultures from [**7-16**]
and 19 grew e. faecalis. he was started on Ampicillin and
vancomycin on [**2195-7-18**]. Echo showed 1.7 cm vegetation on mitral
valve. Patient seen by ID and abx changed to Ampicillin and
Gentimicin. The source of this endocarditis appears to be a UTI
he had in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year which grew out enterococcus on
culture.

echo:
 The left atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is
elevated (>15)
suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The aortic root is
mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
moderately thickened and there is mild to moderate mitral inflow
gradient.
There are large echodense structures associated with the mitral
valve that are
consistent with calcification and probable vegetation (although
prior study
not available to assess acuity of findings). Mild to moderate
([**12-1**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT

Reason: PEA ARREST, EVAL FOR DVT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old man with CHF, s/p PEA arrest, unable to get CTA
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for DVT
INDICATION: 77-year-old man with CHF status post PEA arrest
evaluate for DVT.

There are no prior studies for comparison.
.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: Bilateral femoral
lines limit evaluation of the common femoral veins. Grayscale,
color, and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left superficial
femoral and popliteal veins demonstrate normal compressibility,
waveforms, color flow, and augmentation. There is no evidence of
intraluminal thrombus.

IMPRESSION:

1. No DVT in the superficial femoral or popliteal veins. The
common femoral veins were not able to be evaluated.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for new emboli to brain vs. bleeding of existing
emboli

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old man with known enterococcus endocarditis with emboli
to brain now s/p code with bradycardia and complete heart block
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for new emboli to brain vs. bleeding of existing emboli.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: acute renal failure

REASON FOR EXAMINATION: History of known enterococcus
endocarditis with emboli to the brain. Evaluate for new emboli
and/or bleeding to the brain.

TECHNIQUE: Head CT without intravenous contrast with contiguous
5-mm axial images from the skull vertex to the base.

No prior head CT for comparison. Compared to the MR of [**2195-7-23**].

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There are multiple areas of hypodensity in both [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white
matter of both cerebral hemispheres, and more predominantly so,
in the cerebellum. These most likely represent embolic infarct,
and are greater in number than the infarcts seen on MR of
[**2195-7-23**]. In addition, not seen on the MR done the day before, is
loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation consistent with
generalized brain swelling. There is a chronic lacune in the
head of the left caudate nucleus. There is no shift of midline
structures or hydrocephalus.

IMPRESSION:
1. Find
