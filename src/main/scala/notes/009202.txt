Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
GIB, mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70 year old female with a history of diabetes
mellitus type 2, ESRD on hemodialysis and cirrhosis presenting
to an outside hospital with mental status changes.  She was
brought in by her family due to increasing confusion after
dialysis yesterday. Her daughter was not aware of dark stools
until she presented to the hospital.
.
In the OSH ED, her ammonia level was 123 and she was given
lactulose. NG lavage failed x 2 so she was given ativan and
versed for conscious sedation and a third NG lavage attempt
returned negative. Her Hct was 29.9 and she remained
hemodynamically stable. A right subclavian line was placed and
she was given Protonix. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED because
most of her medical care is here.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her Hct was 30.5. Her SBP remained in the 130s
and HR in the 80s. She was lethargic and not oriented but
maintained O2 sats in the high 90s on room air so was not
intubated. She had 2 episodes of melanotic stools while in the
ED. Given the conscious sedation she received at the OSH, she
was given Narcan with no effect. GI was made aware and given her
hemodynamic stability, plans were made to scope her tomorrow.

.
portable CXR: Mild cardiogenic hydrostatic edema. No definite
pneumonia.
.
Abdominal ultrasound with dopplers:
1. On this technically limited study, no color Doppler flow was
demonstrated in the portal vein, consistent with either
extremely low or absent portal venous flow.
2. Cirrhosis with associated splenomegaly.
3. Gallstones.
.
Abdominal CT scan:
 1. Limited evaluation of the portal vein. No gross filling
defects within the main portal vein to suggest thrombus. If
there is further clinical concern about portal vein thrombosis a
duplex Doppler ultrasound of the liver is recommended.
2. Moderate to large right pleural effusion.
3. Cirrhosis, collateralization, and splenomegaly, all
consistent with portal hypertension.
4. 2 mm nonobstructing right renal stone.
.
.
[**12/2176**] Fistulogram:
A fistulogram was performed and demonstrated the venous outflow
to the level of the right atrium. An area of tight stenosis was
demonstrated at the outflow cephalic vein in the arm, associated
with some collaterals. Patent central veins.
.
1.  Left AV fistulogram demonstrating patent superior vena cava,
left
brachiocephalic, and left subclavian veins.
2.  Multiple collaterals were seen in the area of the axilla, as
well as tight stenosis in the outflow of the cephalic vein.
3.  Successful dilation with a 6 mm balloon at the level of
stenosis with mild improvement of the venous outflow.
4.  Unsuccessful attempts to opacify the arterial side of the
fistula due to patient discomfort



Brief Hospital Course:
1. Altered mental status: likely hepatic encephalopathy in the
setting of GI bleed.  She had an elevated ammonia at the outside
hospital and was treated with lactulose. The patient responded
well and was at her baseline mental status at discharge.
.
2. GI Bleed: the patient underwent EGD which demonstrated
gastric angioectasias/watermelon stomach.  Her hematocrit
trended down and she was transfused 2 units prbcs and was
maintained on an octreotide drip, [**Hospital1 **] PPI and sucralfate. She
underwent second EGD for APC, which was successful. She was
transitioned to twice daily PPI and low dose propranolol.
H.pylori negative.
.
3. Portal vein thrombosis: positive by ultrasound, negative by
CT scan of the abdomen. Not a candidate for anticoagulation.
.
4. End stage renal disease: the patient was followed by the
renal team and dialyzed by her regular schedule while inpatient.
Per the patient's daughter, the outpatient dialysis unit said
the patient needed a fistulogram.  She had the fistulogram
performed [**2177-5-26**].
.
5. Bacteremia: the patient had [**2-6**] positive gram positive rod
blood culture. No fever, no leukocytosis from admission. She was
treated initially with Zosyn/Vancomycin and her central line
needed to be removed.  The line was removed [**2177-5-23**] and had no
growth. The patient will continue Vancomycin with Hemodialysis
until [**2177-5-27**].
.
6. DM: the patient was continued on her home dose of Lantus and
SSI.
.
7. Diastolic dysfunction: evidence of edema on initial chest
x-ray, but not hypoxic. The patient was maintained on her home
Lasix dose and further fluid management was done by
hemodialysis.
.
8. Disposition: the patient was discharged to rehabilitation
after a prolonged hospitalization.  She will follow up with her
PCP and primary hepatologist as an outpatient.
