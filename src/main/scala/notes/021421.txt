psoriatic arthritis, sent in by PCP for reported 2 day history
of dark tarry stools. Also found to have some symptomatic

found to be guiac positive but no episodes of stool. Hct was
found to be 18.9, INR was 3.3. NG lavage was negative. Given 2
units of FFP and 10mg IV vitamin K. Patient was ordered for
pRBCs but was not yet transfused due to difficult crossmatch. GI
aware of patient. Got 40 IV protonix. Vitals on transfer: HR 65,
BP 99/36, RR 19, 100% on RA.
.
Blood pressure was 98/52 at last clinic visit. His last EGD and
colonoscopy in [**2181-6-3**] was unremarkable. Followed by [**Doctor Last Name 1940**]
as outpatient GI for diarrhea due to pancreatic insufficiency.

Brief Hospital Course:
88M with afib on coumadin, CHF(EF 25-30%), s/p PPM, pancreatic
insufficiency, admitted with melena and orthostatic hypotension.
.
#. Acute Blood Loss Anemia from bleeding duodenal ulcer - In the
setting of supratherapeutic INR on home coumadin. INR on admit
was 4.4 and reversed with FFP and IV vitamin K. Beta blocker
held.  Admitted to the MICU and given 3 units of pRBCs with Hct
19.1 -> 23.  Patient placed in IV BID PPI.  EGD/colonoscopy
performed at bedside on [**8-23**] in MICU showed a non-bleeding
duodenal ulcer.  H. pylori sent. Two additional units of PRBC's
were transfused, Hct then bumped from 23 --> 28. Patient was
stable and transferred to medical floor.  There he had no more
melena, VSS and his hematocrit remained >30 on the last two days
of admission.  He was restarted on coumadin and metoprolol on
the day of discharge.
.
# Coagulopathy:  Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation,
but is now AV paced so there is no risk of fib, however he has a
history of DVT and mechanical mitral valve requiring
anticoagulation.  INR was 4.4 on admission for unclear reasons.
He had recently been changed from 5mg coumadin 3 times a week to
2.5mg every day.  He reportedly had no new medications that were
interacting with the coumadin.  Coumadin was held for 3 days and
restarted at 2.5 per day on day 4, INR was therapeutic at 2.7 on
discharge.  He will need close follow up to make sure his INR
stays between 2 and 3.
.
# Hypernatremia- Na 146 on the last two days of admission, up
from 144 at admission. He had no change in mental status.  It
was likely hypovolemic hypernatremia as the patient had only one
meal an no IVF for several days. Will likely resolve when the
patient is taking PO.
.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Creatinine on admission was 1.8
and then decreased to 1.6.  His baseline since [**8-11**] has been
1.8-2.0.  His medications were renally dosed and he was kept on
a renal diet.
.
# Systolic Heart Failure, Last ECHO in [**2177**] showed EF of 25-30%:
On admission Patient hypovolemic on exam from blood loss.  Was
monitored for need for diuresis while receiving transfusions but
did not require this. . Patient restared on home lasix of 40mg
PO daily to every other day after EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] with no active
bleeding.
.
# Cardiac/ischemia: Patient with no chest pain, 1st set of
enzymes with slightly increased troponin but CK flat. EKG with
wide complex QRS with RBBB. ROMI'd with enzymes. Continued on
simvastatin, beta blocker initially held.  EKG unchanged
throughout admission.
.
# s/p infected prosthetic knee replacement in right knee:
afebrile, LE at baseline, no indication of infection.  Bactrim
prophylaxis was continued as well as his knee brace.
.
# Gout: Continued allopurinol
.
# Insomnia: Patient recently seen in sleep lab for nightmares,
was continued on seroquel QHS and efforts were made to maintain
sleep-wake cycle.
