Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Pertussis Vaccine,Fluid

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5880**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal distension and bilious vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) Exploratory laparotomy, small bowel
resection, removal of jejunal feeding tube and
jejunojejunostomy. [**2110-3-27**]
2) Exploratory laparotomy; repair of small bowel
perforation x2. [**2110-3-31**]
Placement of VAC dressing.
3) Split-thickness skin graft from right thigh to
abdominal wound [**2110-5-8**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 29 year old male with a complicated past
medical history including SMA syndrome and several abdominal
operations by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (please see previous discharge summary
for further details), presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2110-3-26**] with new
onset abdominal distension and bilious emesis at his rehab
center.

Past Medical History:
1) Cerebral palsy with mental retardation
2) Seizure disorder
3) History of H. pylori gastritis
4) Recent right clavicular fracture on [**2109-9-14**]
5) History of multiple surgeries to the lower extremities for
flexion contractures
6) Recurrent Klebsiella UTI, treated with Bactrim, Rocephin and
Tequin.
7) SMA Syndrome: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (surgery) SBO initially
felt secondary to obstipation brought about by codeine use for
pain managment secondary to clavicular fracture.  A barrium
swallow on [**2109-9-21**] was suggestive of partial obstruction at the
second portion of the duodenum. However, he continued to have
high NG residuals and radiographic features c/w partial SBO
despite clearance of stools, which led to a consideration of SMA
syndrome.  A CT on [**2109-10-2**] showed stable distension of the
stomach and duodenum, with proximal duodenal distension without
apparent dilatation of the distal duodenum. A repeat EGD on
[**2109-10-17**] was performed, at which time duodenal narrowing was not
appreciated. A subsequent gastrograffin study, however, showed
high grade partial obstruction of the duodenum. Suspected
gastric outlet obstruction/partial SBO due to SMA syndrome
suggested on radiographic studies, although duodenal narrowing
not appreciated on repeat EGD. The patient had had minimal
improvement with conservative management, with continued weight
loss and inability to tolerate POs. NG tube was maintained, and
TPN was continued per nutrition recs.  GI consulted, CT angio of
abdomen was done.  The patient underwent EUS on [**11-11**], duodenal
biopsies taken, unable to visualize pancreas, decision made for
pancreatic MRI to be done.  Surgery consulted, thought clinical
picture c/w SMA, plan to have patient undergo surgical
decompression in the near future once his nutritional status has
improved (goal weight of 105 pounds).  The patient was continued
on a PPI [**Hospital1 **] for GI protection given his history of fundus
ulcers.  The patient had a G/J tube placed under IR on [**11-13**],
and tube feeds were started 24 hours after placement.  Biopsies
from duodenum showed mild inactive duodenitis.
8) ARDS [**9-/2109**] at [**Hospital **] Hospital; admitted with abdominal
pain, ? hematemesis and suspected SBO.  A CT chest and abdomen
was performed and reportedly showed multifocal pneumonia with
bilateral pleural effusions, no abdominal mass. His clinical
picture evolved into an ARDS picture requiring intubation on
[**2109-9-22**]. He was treated with Zosyn for presumed aspiration
pneumonia; sputum cultures grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans. He
self-extubated on [**2109-10-6**], and has been stable from a
respiratory standpoint since that point.
9) Left LE DVT, diagnosed on [**2109-12-5**], initially treated with
lovenox, then switched to coumadin.
10) Pancreatic Head Cystic Lesion, followed q1 year

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2110-3-26**] for abdominal
distension and bilious emesis.  His WBC was 31.  He was
afebrile.  He was hypokalemic and hypochloremic.  A CT scan
showed distended loops of fecalized small bowel with jejunostomy
tube in place and collapse of the transverse colon, descending
colon, sigmoid colon. These findings were concerning for
small-bowel obstruction.  He was admitted to the ICU.  He was
kept NPO on IV fluids.  He was started on Ativan for agitation
and morphine for pain.  He was started on Lopressor for
tachycardia.  He was empirically started on Linezolid (history
of VRE), Levaquin, and Flagyl.  On HD 2, a left sided central
venous line was placed and his PICC was removed.  Later that day
he had an exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, removal
of jejunal feeding tube and
jejunojejunostomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (please see operative note for
details).  The jejunal feeding tube had a perforation near it
with barium and tube feedings. There was
a significant amount of barium spillage in the abdomen during
the procedure. The cause of the obstruction appeared to be an
omental band across the Roux-Y loop just as it entered the
distal jejunal anastomosis. The Roux-Y loop appeared to be
intact with the duodenum but this could not be assessed
completely. He recieved 6 L of IV fluids and albumin boluses
post-operatively for oliguria and he eventually responded.
Fluconazole was added.  An A-line was placed.  He was
transferred back to the ICU intubated and sedated.  He had a JP
drain.  He was maintained on drips of Fentanyl, Midazolam, and
Pitressin.  He had an NG tub
