at 5 p.m. had an onset of speech difficulty and at 7:30 p.m.,
his wife found him on the floor with right-sided weakness,
eyes open and nonverbal. He was brought to [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital via EMS. Vitals at 10:30 in the ED were 146/85,
heart rate 64, respiratory rate 20, and saturations 94% on
room air. He subsequently had a decompensation and was
intubated.

CT scan revealed a large left-sided intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. Labs were noted for an INR of 5.9. Given 10 mg of
vitamin K subcutaneously and 2 units of FFP. Loaded with
Dilantin and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Rheumatic heart disease status post
AVR, MVR, and CABG x1 vessel in [**2159-2-22**] on Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION:  BP 149/86, heart rate 72,
respiratory rate 16, and saturations 100%, intubated on
ventilator. Intubated, young-appearing man attempting to pull
at the ET tube with his left hand. HEENT: Nonicteric. Neck:
Supple, no carotid bruits. Chest was clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, harsh S1 and S2
sounds, no murmur. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, positive bowel
sounds. Extremities: No edema. Neurologically: Does not open
eyes to voice or painful stimulation. Cranial nerves: Pupils
2 mm down to 1 bilaterally. EOMs full. Positive doll's eyes.
Corneal reflexes: Absent bilaterally. Facial symmetry: ET
restricts the lower face, but upper face appears wrinkling,
symmetrically. Gag reflex: Gagging on the ET. Motor:
Increased tone in all four extremities. Moves left side
spontaneously, reaching and grabbing for the ET tube with the
left hand. No spontaneous movement of the right hemibody.
Decerebrate posturing of the right arm with pain and flexes
knees and ankle with pain applied to both legs. Purposely
withdraws, localizes with the left arm.

CT shows 5 x 7 cm large left frontal subcortical hemorrhage
which stands 10 slices midline shift to the right, no
hydrocephalus.

Patient was seen emergently in the ED and was taken to the OR
for a craniotomy. Postop, patient had no eye opening. Moves
left upper and lower extremities spontaneously and
purposefully with right-sided hemiparesis. Pupils equal and
brisk. Not following commands. Exam on 15 mg of propofol.
Patient was kept with a SBP of less than 120 and q.1h. neuro
checks with repeat head CT in the morning.

Patient had a repeat head CT on [**4-18**] that showed no change
in the large left intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated
subfalcine herniation and minimal uncal herniation.

On [**2160-4-23**], the patient underwent tracheostomy and PEG
without complication. The patient remained in the ICU until
[**4-24**] when he was transferred to the step-down unit.
Neurologically, he remained unchanged, occasionally opening
his eyes. Purposeful on the left side, hemiparesis on the
right side.

In the neuro step-down, he remained neurologically unchanged.
He had a LP done on [**4-24**] that showed an opening pressure of
27, closing pressure of 14. Twenty cc of CSF was sent. He had
a repeat LP done the following day with an opening pressure
of 32, closing pressure was not recorded. He was seen by the
ID service for a question of meningitis. He also had climbing
LFTs. General surgery was consulted. They recommended getting
a right upper quadrant ultrasound which was done and was read
as negative.

GI was consulted for the elevated LFTs. They felt they were
maybe related to his ceftazidime that he was getting for his
MRSA and urine infection. That was discontinued, and the
patient was kept on vancomycin for MRSA in his sputum and
blood. His LFTs came down slowly. He should have them checked
every week. He also will need to be restarted on Coumadin for
his heart valve. Head CT is pending for [**2160-5-2**]. The
results will decide when he will start on his Coumadin.

He was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy, and
he will require an acute rehab stay. He will remain on
vancomycin for a total of 14 days. Vancomycin should continue
until [**2160-5-9**]. He is on 1000 mg IV q.8. Other
medications: Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., hold for heart
rate less than 60, SBP less than 110, nystatin swish and
swallow 5 cc q.i.d., famotidine 20 mg p.o. b.i.d., heparin
5000 units subcutaneously t.i.d., Keppra 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
insulin-sliding scale, senna 1 tablet p.o. b.i.d., ferrous
sulfate 325 p.o. daily, Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Patient's condition was stable at the time of discharge. He
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in [**1-25**] weeks with a repeat
head CT.
