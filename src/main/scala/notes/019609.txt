Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, [**Hospital 11091**] transfered from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F [**Hospital3 **] resident with Afib, SSS s/p PM, h/o cervical
CA s/p XRT who presented to [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital w/acute confusion,
agitation, [**Hospital **] to 104, O2 sat 88% on RA on [**2103-6-7**]. At OSH,
CXR reportedly c/w LLL PNA & given ceftriaxone & azithro. Pt was
hypotensive w/SBP 88/34 so started on dopamine gtt through
peripheral IV and 1.5 L IVF. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.

Upon arrival to ED here, BP low 100s on dopamine, attempted to
titrate off but when taken completely off, per ED staff, BP
decreased to systolics 80s. WBC elevated to 22 with 90%
neutrophils, CXR here with +LLL PNA. Central lines attempted in
ED were unsuccessful.
Pt was initially full code, but after discussion w/ED staff,
pt's family decided to make pt DNR/DNI (confirmed with living
will [**2096**]) and did not want any further central line attempts.
Pt's daughter was uncomfortable withdrawing pressors since they
had just made big decision about DNR/DNI and wanted to continue
at least overnight with IVF therapy to see if improvement
(understanding that this therapy is suboptimal). Pt was admitted
to MICU for dopamine gtt. Of note, pt was recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] fr [**Date range (1) 109403**] for sepsis and PNA and was intubated for
1 day and d/ced to extended care facility.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], found to have LLL PNA. Dopa run peripherally until
picc line placed. CTX and Azithro given and had pulmonary edema
with IVF.  Dopamine slowly weaned off with MAP 50-60 off dopa
with good UOP and good mentation. ECHO showed preserved EF with
LVH and possible diastolic CHF. Overnight, her urine output
dropped to 10-20cc/hr. Was restarted on IVF.


Past Medical History:
- PNA/sepsis: intubated x1 day in [**3-20**]
- SSS s/p PM
- Afib, not on coumadin due to falls risk
- NSTEMI [**3-20**] in setting of sepsis & PNA
- chronic anemia
- Cervical CA s/p XRT
- radiation colitis s/p partial colectomy, reversed

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2103-6-7**] : CHF and left retrocardiac opacity

was LBBB paced pattern.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F [**Hospital3 **] resident with Afib, SSS s/p PM, h/o cervical
CA s/p XRT transferred fr OSH w/M.S. change, PNA, and
hypotension.

1. PNA: Patient was initially hypotensive and febrile on
admission requiring pressors and infectious work-up revealed a
left retrocardiac opacity on chest x-ray and urine cultures,
blood cultures remained negative. She was emperically treated
with ceftriaxone and azithromycin and her sputum cultures grew
oropharyngeal flora and was negative for legionella. She was
slowly weaned off her pressors and her oxygenation improved to
95% on room air on discharge. She has a PICC line and should
continue a 10 day course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin at
rehab. Additionally, she should continue her albuterol and
atrovent nebulizers as her pneumonia continues to improve.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal [**Name (NI) 109404**] Pt was initially
hypotensive with MAPs in the 50's on dopamine. Her creatinine
increased and her FENA was 2.1% consistent with ATN secondary to
hypotension. She was resuscitated and as her sepsis improved,
her urine output increased and her creatinine went back to
baseline at 1.3-1.4. Her creatinine and urine output should
continue to be measured and if her urine output falls at rehab
or her creatinine increases, consider additional IVF therapy.
Additionally, she should be monitored for a post-ATN diuresis
phase.

3. CHF: Patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema in the
ICU requiring diuretics. She had an echocardiogram showing
evidence of diastolic dysfunction with mild symmetric LVH and
LVEF >55%. Additionally, she has 1+ MR. She likely does not need
active diuresis at this present time but she should have daily
weights, accurate I/O's recorded, and compression stockings for
now.

4. CAD: h/o NSTEMI in [**3-20**], likely demand during sepsis in the
past. She continued her aspirin and her metoprolol was held
secondary to relative hypotension. She will need her BP
reassessed at rehab and her metoprolol should be restarted in
the future when her systolic blood pressure goes up to her
baseline or above 130.

6. Atrial fibrillation: She was rate controlled without
metoprolol and she was continued on her ASA. She was not started
on coumadin secondary to her high risk of falls. Her metoprolol
should be restarted when possible in the future.

7. hx of recent C. difficile - She continued to have diarrhea in
the hospital here and she was reportedly c. difficile positive
at [**Hospital **] rehab. She should be continued on flagyl until her
cultures return as negative and will need to be followed at
rehab. Additionally, if her cultures are postive for c.
difficile, she should be continued on flagyl for 7 days after
finishing her course of antibiotics for her pneumonia.

8. Increased INR: This was likely secondary to nutritional
deficiencies of vitamin K and she was supplemented with vitamin
K in the ICU.

9. CODE STATUS: She remained DNR/DNI throughout the end of her
hospitalization as she was discharged to rehab.
