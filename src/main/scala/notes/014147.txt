Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
61 year old gentleman with COPD, NSCLC stage IV mucinous
adenocarcinoma and recent PE who presents with worsening cough.
Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 102283**] lung cancer was first diagnosed this summer and has
been progressive despite two cycles of carboplatin paclitaxel.
Recent treatment has included placement of a pleurex catheter
for management of RLL collapse and initiation of second line
therapy with premetrexed (day 21) and discussion regarding home
hospice care.

Mr. [**Known lastname 102284**] initial oncologic course has been complicated by
shortness of breath and recurrent thoracentesis. He was
hospitalized in late [**Month (only) 359**] for elective placement of pleurex
catheter for management of RLL collapse.  He was subsequently
seen in the ED for worsening dyspnea from baseline on [**10-26**] for which he was prescribed levofloxacin for 7 days. A CTA
demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary embolism, interval
worsening of bilateral effusions and concern for a LUL
pneumonia.  Since disharge he has noted progressive shortness of
cough, with acute worsening last night with symptoms of self
described air hunger.  His pleurex catheter has been draining
100cc of tea colored fluid per day without change.

In the ED, initial vitals were: A chest xray demonstrated
evidence of a probably left lower lobe pneumonia. He was started
on vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP.  He desaturated to the low
80s and was started on BiPAP 7/4 with saturations in the
90s-100s and RR in the 30s.  Due to discomfort he was
transitioned to a non-rebreather at 12L with oxygen saturation
100% and RR 30 with intermittant transitions back to BiPAP. His
code status was confirmed as DNR/DNI. He was given 125mg IV
solumedrol and albuterol and ipatropium nebs for his COPD.  He
was given 2mg of ativan twice for anxiety, morphine 5mg for pain
and zofran 4mg for nausea. Given his oxygen requirement, he was
transferred to the MICU for further care. Interventional
pulmonology and oncology were made of aware of his admission.

On arrival to the MICU, initial vitals were 96 136 143/93 31 88.
The patient's brathing was visibly labored and he was unable to
speak full words.  His physical exam was significant for mottled
skin, rhoncherous breath sounds throughout his lung fields and
diaphoresis, closed eyes. Discussion regarding goals of care was
initiated with the patient and long-time partner at the bedside.
 When asked what the patient would like regarding his care, he
replied morphine.  Goals of care was discussed with his partner
who indicated the goal was comfort and explained outpatient
initiation of hospice. The legal health care proxy, his sister
[**Name (NI) 5969**] [**Name (NI) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] by phone who discussed that her
brother would at this time wish to be made comfortable. It was
explained with the partner, health care proxy and the patient
that goals of care would be focused towards comfort measures
including morphine.  The patient at this time was unable to
participate in this conversation.  A morphine drip was started.
The patients primary oncologist, and oncology nursing staff were
notified of his admission.  Chaplain and social work services
were offered.

CXR [**2173-11-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. New left lung base consolidation most likely represents
pneumonia, less
likely new pulmonary mass given short term interval development.

2. Slightly increased opacification of the right apex consistent
with known lung carcinoma. Unchanged opacification of the right
hemithorax and volume loss.
3. New soft tissue calcifications in the region of the right
scapula. Given interval development, query whether this is
external to the patient or palpable on exam.

CXR [**2173-11-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Regression of previously identified left lower lobe
infiltrates suspected to be of inflammatory origin in this
patient with history of advanced right-sided pulmonary
carcinoma. A left-sided pleural effusion stable blunts the
lateral pleural sinus.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old gentleman with COPD, NSCLC stage IV mucinous
adenocarcinoma complicated by recent PE, placement of R pleurex
catheter for RLL collapse and progression of disease on first
line therapy who presents with respiratory distress.

# Respiratory distress- History of NSCLC stage IV EGFR, ALK, and
KRAS with osseous mets.  Initial DDx PNA, atelectasis, mucous
plugging.  CXR showed now LLL consolidation.  Received one dose
Vanc/Cefepime in the ED, which did not continue.  Patient
presented to the MICU with respiratory distress, initially
requesting morphine.  Per discussion with [**Last Name (LF) 16883**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-term
partner, and sister [**Name (NI) 382**], initiated morphine drip for [**Name (NI) 3225**].
Patient improved markedly overnight, so morphine drip was
stopped.  Acute respiratory decompensation attributed to mucus
plug, aspiration, perhaps with contributing atalectasis.
Continued albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers.  Continued home dose
Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] for recent PE. Repeat CXR showed improvement of LLL
consolidation, so antibiotics not restarted.

# NSCLC: Was undergoing palliative second line therapy on day 21
of premetrexed prior to admission.  Chemotherapy discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (outpatient oncologist), who will re-address
chemotherapy with patient in the outpatient setting.  Oncology
nurse will contact him at home for schedulin
