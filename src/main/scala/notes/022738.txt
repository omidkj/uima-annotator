Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 88-year-old male has a
history of severe aortic stenosis and was referred for
cardiac catheterization.  He recently went to his primary
care physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] routine physical and mentioned at the
time that he had been having chest discomfort and dyspnea for
the past few months after climbing two flights of stairs.
The discomfort resolved with rest.  He was referred for an
echocardiogram which revealed mild concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of 65% and
severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.9 cm
sq, a peak gradient of 51 mmHg and a mean gradient of 35
mmHg.  He had 1+ AR, 2+ MR, and 1+ PR.  He was referred for
cardiac catheterization.  He denied claudication, orthopnea,
edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He did have
lightheadedness with exertion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. History of hypercholesterolemia.
2. History of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  3.
Status post severe bladder infection in [**3-21**].  4. Status
post transient ischemic attack in 05/85.  5. Status post
prostate surgery in the [**2147**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked three to four cigarettes
a day up until surgery and had a long smoking history prior
to that.  He does not drink alcohol.  He lives with his wife.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Lorazepam p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is an elderly white male in no
apparent distress.  Vital signs were stable, afebrile.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx benign.  Neck:  Supple, full range of
motion, no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids 2+ and
equal bilaterally without bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 with no rubs, murmurs or
gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender with positive bowel
sounds, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:
Without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Pulses were 2+ and
equal bilaterally throughout.  Neurological:  Examination was
nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He underwent cardiac catheterization on
[**2171-5-14**] that revealed an aortic valve area of 0.9 cm sq,
left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, 1+ mitral
regurgitation, a 70% discrete lesion of his mid RCA, 60%
lesion of the acute marginal, 80% lesion of the distal RCA,
50% left main lesion, 90% diagonal 2 lesion, 90% proximal
circumflex lesion, and a 90% obtuse marginal 1 lesion.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] was consulted and on [**2171-5-17**] the patient underwent an
aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting x 3
with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, reversed saphenous vein graft to
the obtuse marginal and posterior descending coronary artery
and an aortic valve replacement with a #21 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
pericardial valve.  The cross-clamp time was 153 minutes,
total bypass time 188 minutes.  He was transferred to the
cardiac surgery recovery unit in stable condition on
Neo-Synephrine.  He was extubated on the postoperative night.
He was off all drips.  He was in stable condition.

On postoperative day two he had his chest tubes discontinued.
He did have a heart block and was AV paced.  On postoperative
day three he was confused.  He was on antibiotics because he
had dental caries which were evaluated preoperatively and
require attention ten days after he gets home from surgery.
He has been on antibiotics for that.

He was evaluated by electrophysiology on [**2171-5-20**] for a
pacemaker and underwent a pacemaker DDD implant on [**2171-5-21**]
with a dual-chamber rate responsive pacemaker [**Company 1543**] model
#SDR303B.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He did start
becoming more confused.  He had his epicardial pacing wires
discontinued after the device was placed.  He then was
getting short of breath and more confused.  He required
central line placement and arterial line placement.  He was
Swanned.  This was on postoperative day number six.  He was
not fluid overloaded.  He was intravascularly dry but he
still was in respiratory distress.  He had a sniff test which
showed that he had a left paralyzed diaphragm.  Pulmonary saw
him and felt that this was part of the cause of his
respiratory distress.  He also has a long smoking history and
this was a contributing factor.  He also was diuresed briefly
with Natrecor.  He did have an increased white count and he
was pancultured.  His lines were changed and he did grow
yeast from his line tip.  He also was having inappropriate
pacing and when his line was changed over a wire, his atrial
lead became dislodged.  His pacer was eventually revised and
he was treated with fluconazole and Zosyn and vancomycin for
his increasing white count.  He did have a chest tube placed
on the left for an effusion.  This eventually resolved.  He
continued to be on CPAP and BiPAP and eventually on
postoperative day 15 require reintubation and on
postoperative day 17 he had a tracheostomy and PEG placement.
He was much improved on that.  He was on the vent during the
day with 5 of pressure support, 5 of PEEP and had good gases
on that, and then at night he would rest on 10 of pressure
support.

On postoperative day 18 he was on a tracheostomy collar for
approximately two hours and did well with that.  He was to be
discharged to rehabilitation but had a little vomiting when
his tube feeds were restarted so he was changed to Impact
with fiber.  He tolerated this well.  He was up to 50 cc an
hour and probably should be increased to 80 cc an hour for
goal.  He was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation on
postoperative day number 21 in stable condition.

His laboratory studies on discharge were hematocrit 31.7,
white count 8, platelet count 147, sodium 137, potassium 4.3,
chloride 100, CO2 28, BUN 19, creatinine 1.9.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Tylenol 1-2 tablets p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n. pain.
2. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. once a day until [**2171-7-2**], then 200

9. Zosyn 2.25 grams IV q. 6 hours until [**2171-6-14**].
10. Vancomycin 1 gram IV q. 24 hours through [**2171-6-12**].
11. Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
12. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.
13. Regular Insulin sliding scale p.r.n.

FOLLOW UP:  He will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one to two
weeks after discharge from rehabilitation and by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as well and then in four weeks by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].
