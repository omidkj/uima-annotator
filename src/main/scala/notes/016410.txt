Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain, Nausea, Vomiting


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2170-4-29**]: EGD

History of Present Illness:
Monitoring after bowel obstruction in setting of elevated INR
and recent Stent ([**4-17**]) requiring pt to remain on ASA/plavix
.
History of Present Illness:
73M w/ CAD s/p CABG with recent SVG-PDA BMS placed on [**4-17**], sCHF
(EF 30% with ICD since [**2165**]), restrictive lung disease with
history of asbestos exposoure, p/w chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain.

Pt stated that his pain started yesterday (Fri) evening. The
pain was [**6-19**], pressure over left sternum, associated with
abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting - lasted all night. Had seen
PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**], earlier that day and was okay, although feeling
slightly off all day. Pt also had three grey loose stool last
night. Didn't have any nausaea or abdominal pain until it
developed suddenly at night. Threy up evening meds (which
according to his wife include his ASA/plavix).

At baseline, pt has chronic SOB with limited ambulation capacity
within the room. He also c/o 3-4 days cough before this
presentation. On ROS, Denies diarrhea or constipation. Denies
history of prior bowel surgeries. No HA, lightheadedness,
dizziness.

Of note, pt had recent PCI by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-17**], with BMS placed in
SVG-RPDA. Pt had patent LIMA-CAD, SVD-D, and occluded SVG-OM.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.6 64 135/68 16 97%. In the [**Name (NI) **], pt
c/t have [**2168-5-16**] chest pain, not responding to nitro sl (1 tab)
and morphine (5mg IV) and dilaudid 1mg IV. Cards saw in ED and
in setting of no EKG changes, neg trops x 2, evidence of bowel
obstruction thought said no concern ACS. Rec continuing
ASA/Plavix due to recent BMS. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] informed. Significant
improvement in abd pain after NG placement with nasty NGT output
after placement. CT abdomen showed strange duodenal volvulus in
part that cannot volvulize -> [**Doctor First Name **] atd more likely obstructive
mass -> need EGD with possible bipsies (GI happy to do once
coagulopathy corrected - want INR < 2, prefer < 1.7). Would only
go to OR for surgery in emergency without diagnosis. Got 2 units
FFP and 10mg IV Vit K. Since was somewhat confused in the ED and
had high INR, head CT done to r/o bleed - no acute changes.
Evidence of vascular disease. VS okay, mid 90s on RA

On arrival to the MICU, feels much better after NGT placement.
No longer nauseated and no abdominal pain. Doesn't feel
confused. No chest pain. Breathing fine.

CT Head W/O Contrast -- Preliminary Result+ Dictated ([**1-/8741**])
No ICH. CHronic bifrontal encephalomalcia and microvasc dz.

CT Abd & Pelvis With Contrast -- Preliminary Result:
Marked stomach distension with twisting of the duodenal bulb,
concerning for early developing midgut volvulus (possibly [**1-11**]
surgical adhesions). Distal bowel is fluid filled with areas of
wall edema and hyperenhancement-could be reactive vs. unerlying
GI infection/inflammation. Markedly distended GB and new mild
diffuse bil dil- ?related to partial CBD obstruction at site of
volvulus. No specific signs for acute cholecystitis, correlate
clinically.

Chest (Pa & Lat)
Preliminary Report: Mild interstitial edema with small bilateral
effusions.

EKG: Afib, rate controlled, abnormal conduction with some PCVs,
no significant change from prior, no ST changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
73yo M w/ PMH significant for A.fib (on Coumadin), presumed ILD,
severe CAD (s/p 4V CABG), ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF
of 25% presenting with bowel obstruction due to duodenal
volvulus due to hematoma, inflammatory cause, stricture, or
mass, also w/ supratherapeutic INR.

# Bowel Obstruction: Symptoms initially of N/V/Abd pain. Pt had
area of duodenal inflammation on CT scan and surgery was
originally consulted who did not think he required a surgical
intervention. an NG tube was placed and he had a large amount of
nonbloody noncoffee ground gastric contents were suctioned out.
He was made NPO and watched overnight. GI was consulted who
performed an EGD which showed 2 duodenal ulcers but with some
edema around the ampula. While ther was edema near the pylorius
the EGD socope was easily passed through and therefore not an
obstruction. The patient had decreased output from his NGT and
it was pulled on HD #3. His diet was slowly advanced and he was
tolerating a normal diet at the time of discharge.  He denied
any further abodminal pain.
-Started omeprazole 40mg po BID
-Pt will require repeat EGD in 6-8weeks (to be scheduled by the
patient)
-Patient should avoid NSAIDs and alcohol

# CAD with recent Stents: Patient with significant CAD with
situation further complicated by new BMS on [**2170-4-17**]. High risk
for occlusion of stents if misses meds. He had one episode of
chest pain that resolved without intervention within 5 minutes
and had no EKG changes.
