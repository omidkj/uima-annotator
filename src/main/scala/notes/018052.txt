ABDOMEN U.S. (PORTABLE)  [**2137-10-9**] 1:10 PM

DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL PORT; ABDOMEN U.S. (PORTABLE)

Reason: Please assess liver and remainder abdomen, please assess
por

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with sepsis, shock liver
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please assess liver and remainder abdomen, please assess portal
and hepatic veins with doppler flow studies
INDICATION: 75-year-old woman with sepsis and shock liver.

PORTABLE DUPLEX OF THE ABDOMEN: This is a limited study due to
patient's intubated status. The gallbladder is not visualized.
The liver shows normal echogenicity with no focal masses. The
intrahepatic branches of the hepatic artery and hepatic vein are
patent. The main portal vein is patent. The intrahepatic portal
veins are difficult to assess. The pancreas is poorly visualized
but shows no gross abnormality. The right kidney measures 12 cm.
There is a cyst in the superior portion of the right kidney
measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 1.2 cm. The left kidney measures 12 cm,
and there is a cyst in the mid to upper pole measuring 2.4 x 1.8
x 1.4 cm. The aorta is of normal caliber. The spleen is
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Patent main portal vein and hepatic artery and vein. 2.
Bilateral renal cysts.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-10-9**] 6:12 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: UNRESPONSIVE. ? ICH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old woman with unresponsiveness
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for ICH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: creat

INDICATION: Unresponsiveness.

NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: No prior for comparison. Patient is
markedly tilted within the scanner gantry.

FINDINGS: No hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline
structures, intra- or extra- axial hemorrhage, or acute major
vascular territorial infarct is identified. Lacunar infarcts,
chronic in age, are noted in both basal ganglia and subinsular
cortices reflects chronic microvascular infarction. A few subcm.
areas of low density are noted in the right temporal lobe- these
may represent enlarged sulci v. chronic cortical infarcts.

The patient is intubated. No fractures are seen. There is a
small, probable retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus,
with opacification of a few ethmoid air cells, and mild mucosal
thickening in the frontal sinus. Mastoid air cells are poorly
pneumatized and aerated. Sphenoid sinus shows moderate mucosal
thickening. There is fluid and aerosolized secretions in the
nasopharynx and oropharynx, likely due to intubation.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. See
above report for additional findings.

Sinusitis, likely chronic in age.
