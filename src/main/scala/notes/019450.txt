Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
gallstone/obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP ****

History of Present Illness:
75yo F with h/o CHF, GERD and HTN, presenting with sob and
abdominal pain over last few days. Originally presented friday
to OSH with abdominal pain and SOB. She was treated with
antibiotics for presumed UTI (no records of which abx). She was
sent home but came back today feeling a lot worse and at OSH was
noted to be in ARF (creatinine 2.58 - unknown baseline but per
notes higher than before), elevated transaminases and bili. CT
abdomen showed cholelithiasis, thickening of GB wall,
peri-cholecystic fluid, intrahepatic duct dilation, CBD at 9mm,
concerning for choledocolithiasis. This CT scan also showed
extensive lymphadenopathy concerning for lymphoma as well as a
massive peri-umbilical hernia containing fat and colon. She was
transferred to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T:95.0 HR:91 BP:84/47 RR:16 O2Sat:91
on 4L. Patient was given 5L NS because of hypotension while team
tried to place more IV access and draw labs. This was difficult
and so a  right IJ and two peripherals were eventually placed.
Mixed venous sat in upper 80s but remained hypotensive (BPs in
80s systolic) so was started on levophed. HR has not gone above
90 but on beta blocker at home. CVP 14 (per report from resident
although RN quoted it at 9)and h/o CHF so ED concerned about
cardiogenic shock after the 5L NS but O2 sats stable (100% on 5L
NC).
.
On the floor, patient said her breathing felt fine but she has
had a cough. She was having no pain and was hungry. Per her
family she has had abdominal pain for about a month but in the
last few days has had increasing shortness of breath and trouble
breathing. She also had increasing lower extremity swelling and
they were worried about her heart. They also noted that she
looks yellow.
.

.
EKG: NSR with rate hihg 80s, Nl axis. Non-diagnostic QW I, avL.

.
CXR on admission to our ED: slightly suboptimal due to resp
motion. ill defined opacity at left lung base, may =
consolidation/pneumonia. suggest repeat PA and lateral views as
clinically indicated. mild central vascular engorgement
.
CXR (my read): RIJ in SVC (after pulling back from prior XR)
with left-sided pleural effusion/consolidation as noted
previously. mild pulmonary edema unchanged from prior despite 5L
NS in ED.


Brief Hospital Course:
75yo F with h/o CHF admitted with cholecystitis, impacted
gallstone on CT Abd at OSH, with PNA clinically and on CXR
initially seen here in septic shock likely from biliary source.
.
Hypotension was attributed to septic shock from a likely biliary
source.  She was treated with broad specturm antibiotics with
vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and zosyn. She underwent
ERCP on [**2122-4-13**] and a fungating mass was identified at the
ampulla, which was biopsied; a stent was placed in the common
bile duct, restoring bile flow. Biopsy demonstrated a high grade
undifferentiated malignancy, and immunohistochemical stains were
pending. On CT, patient had substantial mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, suggestive of lymphoma.  Patient was started on
methylprednisone.  Further workup was deferred given overall
prognosis and goals of care.  Patient was intubated prior to
ERCP.  After ERCP she failed spontaneous breathing trial, and
was kept on the ventilator. Given her evolving sepsis, she was
started on ARDSnet protocol low tidal volume ventilation, given
risk for ARDS.  Tidal volumes were titrated to minimize
hypercarbia.
.
Given her shock, antihypertensives and diuretics were held. Her
hypotension progressively worsened, requiring IVF boluses, and
pressor support.  Her serum lactate increased to 7.1 and she
developed acute renal failure with a metabolic acidosis and
bicarbonate of 11. She was placed on a bicarbonate drip.  A
central venous saturation was 88 consistent with septic shock.
Patient was noted to have cool mottled extremities, and lost
peripheral pulses in her feet.  Vascular surgery was consulted
and heparin gtt was started.  It was thought that her limb
ischemia was likely caused by pressors with a possible
contribution of arterial thrombus. On [**2122-4-15**], she required
maxiumum doses of norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopressin
after fluid resuscitation.  She still became hypotensive to SBP
70s.  On [**2122-4-15**], her family decided to change her code status
to comfort measures only, and pressors were stopped.  Patient
expired on [**2122-4-15**] at 11:20 am.
