Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Evaluation for IR procedure for LGIB of unknown etiology

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Upper endoscopy
2. Colonoscopy
3. CT Angiography
4. Tagged RBC Scan
5. Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound
6. Infrarenal IVC filter placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13144**] is a 87-year old woman with history of CAD CHF and
previous history of internal hemorrhoids transferred from OSH
for 3 days of LGIB. She initially presented on [**11-15**] from an
[**Hospital3 **] facility with an episode of BRBPR in her
bathroom to [**Hospital **] hospital, with an initial Hct of 31.9. Ms.
[**Known lastname 13144**] was hemodynamically stable and admitted to the floor
where she sustained a gradual drop in her Hct (naidr 22.9) and
platelets (89K) and subsequently transfused and. She received a
colonoscopy that demonstrated old/fresh blood throughout colon
with diverticular disease most pronounced on the left. The
bleeding source could not be identified. She continued to bleed
and was then transferred to the ICU.
.
On the morning [**2172-11-17**], Ms. [**Known lastname 13144**] received a tagged RBC scan
that demonstrated no active bleeding. Later that day, she began
to bleed again and a repeated tagged RBC scan (11hrs post
contrast) showed diffuse activity throughout the colon with the
most likely origin near the hepatic flexure. (Poor localization
of bleeding by tagged RBC scan is noted). Concerned about the
risks major surgery, GI and surgery at [**Location (un) **] thought IR might
a good therapeutic option.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 13144**] was therefore tranfered to the [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation
for possible IR. At the time of transfer, SBP ranged 110s-120s,
HR 80s, O2 Sat 98-100% 2L NC. She had one episode of tachycardia
for which she received a single dose of a beta blocker (her home
beta blocker had been held up to this point).
.
<strong> Summary of events and interventions at OSH: 6 units
PRBCs, 1 unit plts, intermittent episodes of BRBPR (~300cc in
total) during transfer. Cause of bleeding unclear. OSH Hct 22 ->
27 </strong>
.
On [**2172-11-18**], at arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] she was calm and in no acute
distress. MICU ([**2172-11-18**] - [**2172-11-21**]) interventions events: 2 units
PRBC, intermittent episodes of bloody BMs, imaging studies (EGD,
colonoscopy, angiography) inconclusive.
.
# [**2172-11-18**]
- 1 unit PRBCs (Hct 28.1 --> 28.5 --> 28)
.
# [**2172-11-19**]
- Tachycardic to 120s, treated with diltiazem 5mg, HR decreased
to 60s but pt remained in Afib
- NG lavage w/traumatic epistaxis (Pt became tachycardic to
120s, treated with diltiazem 5mg, HR decreased to 100)
- EGD: Erythema in the pre-pyloric region. Otherwise normal EGD
to third part of the duodenum.
- Colonscopy: 2 large sigmoid nonbleeding diverticuli, sigmoid
1.4cm flat polyp. More blood in left colon than right colon. No
source of bleeding within the colon was identified
- Maroon BM w/stable Hct (26-28)
.
# [**2172-11-20**]:
- Hct AM 24.4 in setting of bloody BM -> 1uPRBC -> Hct 29.9; Hct
remained stable
- Angiography: No sign of active bleeding
- Stools: 3 bloody BL prior
.
Prior to transfer from the ICU, vital signs were Tmx: 98.9 Tcur:
98.2
HR 77 BP 115/52 (110-144/42-106) RR 21 (14-28) O2 Sat 97% on RA.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, Ms. [**Known lastname 13144**] reports no acute
distress, however, she does report feeling somewhat lightheaded.
Her mental status has been stable. She had 1x bloody bowel
movement approximately <150 ml. Her Hct has remained stable at
27.6. Since her initial presentation at [**Location (un) **] and arrival to
the floor, she has received a total of 10 units PRBCs.
