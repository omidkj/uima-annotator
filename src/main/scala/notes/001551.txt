Allergies:
morphine

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3298**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for ERCP for bile leak

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with stent placement


History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 yo F with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, dyslipidemia, GERD,
history of CVA, and tracheobronchomalacia and eosinophilic
bronchitis who presented on transfer from [**Hospital3 60338**] for ERCP for a biliary leak.  Patient initially presented
to OSH on [**10-5**] with RUQ abdominal pain and nausea without
vomiting.  Her labs were significant for WBC 11.6, Tbili 0.5,
Dbili 0.2, amylase 97, lipase 26, ALT 22, AST 22, alk phos 121,
UA positive. Patient had a RUQ ultrasound which showed interval
development of mild to moderate biliary dilatation (CBD 9mm at
level of ampulla).  Also with 9 mm gallstone in the fundus of
the gallbladder.  She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy
[**10-6**] which was a difficult procedure and JP drain was left in
place.  Due to persistently high output and suspicion of bile
leak ERCP was attempted [**2199-10-8**] to assess for cystic duct leak
however unable to cannulate common bile duct.  Decision made to
transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP with biliary stent if there
is a cystic duct leak.

On presentation here patient reported [**7-24**] RUQ pain, described
as sharp.  Pain steadily worsening.  She denied nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, cp, sob or lightheadedness/dizziness.  No
fever or chills.  No po intake since ERCP.  Patient did have a
significant amount of epigastric abdominal pain after ERCP on
day prior to arrival but that resolved after procedure.  She
denied hematochezia or melena.  Last BM prior to admission.

ROS as per HPI otherwise 10 pt ROS negative

OTHER RESULTS
==============
ECG Study Date of [**2199-10-10**] Atrial fibrillation with ventricular
premature beats. Left axis deviation. Diffuse ST-T wave
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2199-10-10**]  IMPRESSION: No evidence
of obstruction. The evaluation of free air is limited on this
supine radiograph. Suggest upright films to better assess for
free air.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2199-10-10**]
IMPRESSION: Free intraperitoneal air. Please see comments above
regarding
documentation of communication of this finding.

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2199-10-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Inflammatory changes and free air but no drainable
collection. Free air
of uncertain significance in the setting of recent surgery
although bowel
perforation cannot be excluded.
2. Small focal fluid collection adjacent to the pancreas.
4. Distended fluid-filled loops of bowel suggest an ileus.
5. Bibasilar atelectasis and effusions.
6. Biliary stent and pneumobilia consistent with recent ERCP.
Abdominal
drain with tip in the surgical bed.

ERCP [**2199-10-10**]:
Impression:
-The major papilla was gaping, but did have the appearance of a
fish mouth papilla.
-Extravasation was noted at the right intrahepatic duct c/w with
a duct of Luschka leak.
-Otherwise normal biliary tree.
-A sphincterotomy was performed.
-A biliary stent was placed.
-Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2199-10-11**] Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo F with CAD, s/p PM, HTN, dyslipidemia, GERD, hx of CVA,
tacheomalacia and eosinophilic bronchitis who initially
presented to OSH on [**2199-10-5**] with cholecystitis now s/p lap
chole with complicated surgery requiring JP drain presented in
transfer with concern for bile leak.

1) Cholecystitis s/p lap chole: On admission, patient with
abdominal pain and increased JP drain output concerning for bile
leak. Pt was initially admitted to Medicine, and the ERCP team
was consulted.  She underwent successful ERCP with placement of
a plastic stent, which relieved the biliary leak.  Following the
procedure, pt developed acute respiratory distress and hypoxia.
CXR was concerning for acute pulmonary edema. She was treated
with lasix for diuresis and she was transferred to the ICU for
further care. In the ICU, patient was noted to have free air
under the diaphragm and was evaluated by surgery for urgent OR.
However, given stable abdominal exam
