History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 55yoF with a h/o hodgkin's lymphoma dx in [**2148**]
treated with 6 cycles of chemotherapy [**2149**]-[**2150**] (no radiation),
and asthma who presents with 5 months of B-symptoms (afternoon
fevers to 102, chills, night sweats, progressive shortness of
breath, easy bruising). She notes these are the same exact
symptoms she had when she was first diagnosed with lymphoma in
[**2148**].

She was first evaluated for these symptoms in [**Month (only) 116**] at [**Hospital1 2177**], where
a CT scan showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Approximately 1
month ago, she underwent a bone marrow biopsy and
mediastinoscopy with subcarinal node biopsy that were, per the
patient's report, unrevealing. She established care here at
[**Hospital1 18**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] shortly after these studies, and underwent
rigid bronchoscopy [**2160-8-6**] for lymph node biopsy (around the
RLL).  The day of her procedure she was NPO all day, and only
received 700cc fluid in the OR.  She did well immediately
post-op, but in the PACU developed tachycardia to the 140s,
tachypnia to the high 30s, hypotensive to the high 80s systolic
and febrile to 102, concerning for a SIRS response. She
complained of chest tightness and so an ekg, chest xray, and
labs were sent she was monitored. The ekg showed sinus
tachycardia and the first trop was negative. She was given
demerol and tylenol for rigors, started on vanc and zosyn, then
sent to the MICU. There, she was continued on the vancomycin
(lymph node gram stain showed GPCs) and rehydrated with mulitple
liters of fluid.  In the MICU she was noted to be coughing up
blood tinged sputum, was given nebulizers, and required O2 only
when asleep. When her tachycardia resolved and her blood
pressure stabilized, she was sent to the floor.

As for recent infections, she was treated at [**Hospital1 2177**] for PNA in
[**5-8**], and was treated with a z-pack without resolution of
symptoms.  She went to [**Hospital1 112**] with persistent symptoms, and was
diagnosed with EBV.  It was during this hospitalization that she
had a CT chest/abd/pelvis showing mediastinal and abdominal LAD,
prompting the above work up.

ROS: Reports fluctuations in weight over the last few months,
chronic constipation, and recent HA which she describes as
throbbing, are focal and can occur anywhere in her head, happen
any time of the day, have associated white spots in her visual
fields, and are relieved by 2 tablets of Alieve. Patient also
has a baseline cough of clear sputum [**1-30**] cup/day.  Denies sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea, congestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria,
frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies
rashes.

**Of note, she has port in place from [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**] from [**2149**],
which has not been accessed since her chemotherapy treatments
finished. It has been accessed here by [**Doctor First Name 8817**] and works and can
be used. But [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name 8817**], we need records from NWH with
information about the port (we know it's not a power port, but
need lot number, refrence number, type of port).  Currently
these records are in storage; NWH is in the process of
collecting these records, and will fax them to the MICU and to
[**Doctor First Name 8817**] directly.

PATHOLOGY:

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT
INTERPRETATION: Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile;
diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by lymphoma
are not seen in specimen. Correlation with clinical findings and
concurrent morphology (see cytology report) is recommended. Flow
cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due
to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
