Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain, Chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous Nephrostomy Tube Placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16232**] is a 75 y/o female with a h/o a recent episode of
ischemic colitis, thyroid cancer and OSA who initially presented
to the ER with complaints of sharp epigastric abdominal pain
that radiated to her back, associated with nausea, shortness of
breath, one episode of emesis and constipation.  The patient was
concerned that this pain could be her ischemic colitis
recurrence or related to her worsening back pain so she called
her doctor who referred her into the ER.  Additionally she has
been experiencing shaking chills overnight Sunday and Monday
nights, she says that she woke up at 2am both nights with
shaking chills and had difficulty sleeping from the chills.

In the ED, initial VS were: 99.2, 84, 116/58, 16, 98% on RA.  On
examination by the resident she was noted to be febrile to 104.4
and rigoring, she was given acetaminophen and empirically
covered with vancomycin and cefepime.  Additionally, she was
found to have blood pressures that were discordant by 15mmHg in
each arm and given her description of stabbing epigastric pain
that radiated to her back and her h/o ischemic colitis she was
sent for CTA torso.  The CTA did not show any evidence aortic
disection or ischemic colitis, but did show a large 1cmx1.4cm
obstructing renal stone with associated moderate left
hydronephrosis.  Urology was consulted who recommended urgent
placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy tube with IR.  She was
also given 100mcg of fentanyl for pain and 8mg of zofran for
nausea, a total of 2LNS and admitted to the MICU for further
management.  VS on transfer: 101.2, 96, 108/62, 24, 98% on RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, initial VS were: 98.3, 89, 104/59, 23,
98% on RA.  Shortly after her arrival to the MICU her blood
pressure fell to the 80's systolic, she was bolused 1L NS and
taken to IR for percutaneous nephrostomy placement.  The
procedure was uncomplicated but on return to the MICU was
rigoring and uncomfortable.
.

STUDIES
EKG
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular
block. Left
ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria. Non-diagnostic Q
waves in the
lateral limb leads. Early anterior R wave transition.
Intraventricular
conduction delay. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-10-6**], T
wave ampitude is improved in the inferolateral leads.
Depolarization patterns are similar.
.
CTA chest abdomen pelvis
1. Moderate left hydronephrosis secondary to a 14 x 10 mm
obstructing stone
in the pelviureteric junction. Additional non-obstructing left
renal stone in the upper pole. Possible superimposed infection
in the left renal collecting system.
2. No evidence of aortic dissection or bowel ischemia.
3. Unchanged stenosis of the celiac origin, with likely
retrograde flow in the distal celiac trunk.
4. Aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal artery, stable since the
recent study of [**2109**], but slightly larger since the earliest
study of [**2106**].
5. Extensive sigmoid colonic diverticulosis without evidence of
acute
diverticulitis.
