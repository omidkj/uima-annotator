Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
CoreValve for AS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Perutaneous Corevalve after unsuccessful unsuccessful direct
approach

History of Present Illness:
This 74 year old woman has symptomatic severe aortic stenosis
(valve area 0.8-1.0cm2, peak gradient 66 mm Hg), as well as a
history of PVD,CVA, COPD how presented for an elective CoreValve
placement. She reports her symptoms have progressed to shortness
of breath [**12-14**] block, inability to climb greater than 4 stairs
without stopping due to shortness of breath, and worsening
fatigue. In addition, she now reports episodes of intermittent
chest pain with activity.

She presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2179-7-22**] for elective direct aortic
corevalve, but was found to have anatomy that was not appropiate
following a mini-sternotomy. She ended up undergoing percutanous
placement of the valve. She was intubated for the procedure and
following the procedure she was taken to CVICU. She was found to
be in volumne overload following the procedure and was
transfered to the CCU for treament.
.

Vitals on transfer were 98.9 73 115/72 20 100% on assist/control

Pertinent Results:
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
[**2177-7-21**]
Pre implant

A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] , [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were notified in person of the
results on [**2179-7-22**] at 845 am.

Post implant

Corevalve seen in the aortic position. It appears well seated.
There is mild perivalvular aortic insufficiency seen. There is
mitral mitral regurgitation present. Rest of the examination is
unchanged.

Left femoral US for pseudoanneurysm:
CONCLUSION:  Negative study.

CXR [**7-23**]
FINDINGS:  The ET tube is in similar location.  There is a new
right IJ line with tip in the SVC.  The NG tube tip is off the
film, at least in the stomach.  There continues to be severe
cardiomegaly.  The amount of pulmonary vascular redistribution
and perihilar haze has increased.  Bilateral pleural effusions
have increased.  Volume loss/infiltrate is increased in both
lower lobes.  The overall impression is that of worsened fluid
status and underlying infectious infiltrate in the lower lobes
cannot be excluded.

Discharge Echo [**8-3**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet
motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated, normal
functioning aortic CoreValve prosthesis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-7-29**],
the findings are similar.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2173**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 87579**] is a 76 yo female with hx of severe Aortic stenosis,
CAD, CHF, COPD POD2 s/p elective core valve procedure for
critical Aortic valve stenosis. Course complicated by difficulty
extubating and respiratory disress.

# Severe Aortic Stenosis. Patient is s/p core valve placement on
[**2179-7-21**]. Initially had planned for an "open approach" however
secondary to extensive aortic calcification decision made
