Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope ? cardiac arrest - cooled as per protocol

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary Intubation


History of Present Illness:
74 yo M with unknown past medical history suffered an episode on
unresponsiveness at a casino, underwent 5 minutes of chest
compressions prior to regaining a pulse without defibrillation,
and was ultimately started on a cooling protocol at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
prior to transfer to our ED.
.
Records of the event and his initial treatment are limited. We
know that he was standing when he collapsed and suffered a minor
laceration to his head. Chest compressions were started
immediately and were continued for 5 minutes prior to rhythm
analysis by an AED which did not advise shock. 300cc NS given by
EMS and he was intubated prior to transport; unknown if any meds
were given by the initial EMS team.
.
At [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], cooling protocol was started and pt given a
dilantin load for question of seizure-like activity. NCHCT in
OSH ED showed significant chronic microvascular changes, but
nothing acute. CT PA showed no PE and borderline aneurysmal
dilation of the ascending aorta (4cm). EKG showed atrial
fibrillation with a ventricular response in the 120s, occ PVCs,
IVCD (QRS 120).
.
Pt transported by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**]. Enroute he received 350mg
fentanyl, 8mg pancuronium, 1mg ativan, 20/kg/min propofol.
Cooling continued.
.
In our ED, he received 4.5 g zosyn IV for possible LUL
infiltrate, ASA 325, plavix 300, heparin drip, metoprolol 25 po
x1 and tylenol 1g PR. His EKGs were c/w atypical atrial flutter
with 2:1 conduction. By the time he arrived in the CCU, he had
converted to sinus rhythm.
.
Initial labs were notable for trop 0.23, ck 288, mb pending, cr
1.2, leukocytosis witha left shift, noraml coags.


Past Medical History:
Pos H pylori 2 weeks before admission, treated with prevacid
pack

Carotid ultrasound [**8-7**]:
FINDINGS: Minimal calcific plaque at the origin of both internal
carotid
arteries. The peak systolic velocities bilaterally are normal as
are the
ICA/CCA ratios. There is normal antegrade flow involving both
vertebral
arteries.
IMPRESSION: Minimal bilateral ICA plaque, no appreciable
associated stenosis,
however (graded as less than 40%).
.
ECHO [**8-7**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis/dysnnchrony of the inferior and inferiolateral
walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50
%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-7-29**],
biventricular systolic function is much improved with mild
residual regional dysfunction.
.
CT Chest/ABD/Pelvis [**8-5**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate-sized bilateral psoas hematomas extending into right
iliopsoas
muscle.
2. Minimally displaced fractures involving the right third
through eleventh
ribs and left third through sixth ribs.
3. Cholelithiasis without secondary findings of acute
cholecystitis.
4. Bilateral predominantly hypoattenuating renal lesions some of
which are
too small to definitely characterize and others which are
clearly simple
cysts. Largest 3cm lesion on the right appears more solid and
can be better assessed with a dedicated renal ultrasound on a
non-emergent basis to evaluate for renal cell carcinoma.
5. Mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with probable
adjacent
compression atelectasis. Superinfection cannot be excluded and
should be
correlated with clinical suspicion for underlying pneumonia.
6. Single 2-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. If patient is
at high risk for intrathoracic malignancy this can be followed
with a follow-up chest CT in one year otherwise no further
surveillance is necessary [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] Society guidelines.
.
ECG [**8-9**]:
Sinus rhythm. Occasional ventricular premature beats. Compared
to the previous
tracing of [**2130-8-8**] no definite change.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 74-year-old male was initially admitted following an
episode of collapse while at a casino. It is unclear whether
this was a cardiac arrest but after 5 minutes of CPR there was
evidence of a pulse and AED showed a viable rhythm with no shock
advised. He was never defibrillated. During his fall, he hit his
head and sustained a minor laceration to his forehead. At the
OSH he was intubated and cooled as per protocol and loaded with
phenytoin for ? seizures, a CT-head showed only small vessel
disease with no acute changes. In addition, CT-[**MD Number(3) 85050**] OSH
showed no evidence of PE and a borderline dilation of the aorta.
ECG showed AF in 120s. He was tehn transported via [**Location (un) **] to
teh [**Hospital1 18**] ED and was given a stat dose of Pip/Tazo 4.5g IV for
LUL infiltrates present on CXR, was loaded with aspirin 325mg
and clopidogrel 300mg, commenced on a heparin infusion and
metoprolol was started. At this point ECG shoewd AF/A-flutter w/
2:1 block and he was transferred to the CCU. Initial cardiac
enzymes were TnT 0.44 CK-MB 26. And treatment for possible
pneumonia was continued. He was cooled for 24-hou
