Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, transferred from OSH for STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization s/p Cypher stenting of LCX and OM1


History of Present Illness:
83 y/o man with "on and off" chest pain for several weeks who
presented to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital today complaining of pain that
was persistent. His ECG showed inferior ST elevations with
reciprocal changes. While at [**Hospital1 882**], his exam was consistent
with CHF, as well as CXR. He was given IV lasix, heparin,
integrelin, plavix loaded. He was additionally noted to be
bradycardic to HR 39. He was given atropine 1 mg twice without
response. His BP was 74 systolic, so peripheral dopamine was
started, and he was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for intervention.
.
In cath here he was found to have 90% occlusion of the L Cx, as
well as diffuse disease of a dominant OM1 - cypher stents to
both. There was also 90% mid vessel RCA lesion (non-dominant
vessel).
.
PCWP was 25.

Past Medical History:
- CVA (hemorrhagic) X 2: [**7-29**] and [**2099**] - not on ASA due to this;
no known residual deficits
- Retroperitoneal fibrosis with mult SBO from this and chronic
pain
- DM2 on oral agents only
- HTN

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 132/64 mm Hg while supine. Pulse was 73
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person only.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 8 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
[**2105-2-21**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION: COMMENTS: 1. Coronary
angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated an LMCA
with mild proximal disease. The LAD had minimal luminal
irregularities. The LCX was a dominant vessel with diffuse
disease; the mid-LCX had an average 90% stenosis with evident
thrombus, the dominant OM had severe diffuse disease and evident
thrombus as well; both the LCX and OM had TIMI II slow flow. The
RCA was a small nondominant vessel wtih a 90% lesion in its mid
segment. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal
systemic arterial pressure (on dopamine gtt). Right sided
filling pressures were mildly elevated. 3. Peripheral
angiography demonstrated a 95% lesion in the right external
iliac artery at the bifurcation with the internal iliac artery.
4. PCI:  Successful PTCA and stenting was performed of the AV CX
with a 3.5x18 mm Cypher stent postdilated to 3.75 mm with an NC
balloon. Successful PTCA and stenting was performed of the OM1
with a 3.0x33 mm Cypher stent which was postdilated with a 2.5
mm NC balloon.  Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis,
no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow in both vessels.  (see PTCA
comments). FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Two vessel coronary artery
disease. 2. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by
acute ptca of the LCX. 3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the AV
CX and OM1 was performed with drug eluting stents.
.
[**2105-2-23**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed with inferior and infero-lateral
akinesis, EF = 40-45%. There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right
ventricle. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension, PASP = 63. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19371**] is an 83 year old male with a past medical history
significant for HTN, DM II, hemorrhagic CVA x 2, and
retroperitoneal fibrosis who presented with STEMI.
.
1. STEMI: Mr. [**Known lastname 19371**] presented to an OSH with chest pain. He was
found to have ST elevations in the inferior leads with
reciprocal changes. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization. His troponin peaked at 2.73
pre-catheterization. He underwent successful Cypher stenting of
the LCX and OM1. Catheterization also demonstrated 90% lesion of
the RCA mid-segment which was nondominant and a 95% lesion in
the right external iliac artery at the bifurcation with the
internal iliac artery. Echocardiography demonstrated an EF of
40-45%, mild dilatation of the left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis. His
post-catheterization course was complicated by a bump in
creatinine and CHF, as well as hematemesis in the setting of
Integrilin, heparin, Plavix and aspirin use (see below). He was
continued on his beta-blocker which was increased for improved
heart rate and pressure control. High-dose statin therapy was
initiated. At home, he is on an ACE inhibitor which was held in
the setting of rising creatinine.
.
2. CHF: Volume overload was likely secondary to recent STEMI
with mildly depressed LV function. CHF was managed with
aggressive diuresis and his beta blocker was continued. He had
no oxygen requirement at discharge. Echo as above.
.
3. CREATININE ELEVATION: Mr. [**Known lastname 72329**] creatinine increased from
1.4 to 1.9 post-catheterization. Baseline was unknown. This
acute rise was most likely secondary to contrast nephropathy.
His ACE inhibitor was held, but can be restarted as an
outpatient. Mr. [**Known lastname 19371**] was instructed to have lab work after
discharge. His PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 35888**] will monitor the results.
.
4. UGIB: The patient had one episode of Guiaic (+)
maroon-colored emesis that occurred post-catheterization in the
setting of Integrilin, Plavix, ASA and recent heparin bolus.
