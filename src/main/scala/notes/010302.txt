Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11892**]
Chief Complaint:
pain, swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 48-year-old female with PMHx of spina bifida, HTN, MR,
paraperesis, non-epileptic [**First Name3 (LF) 54422**], and urostomy with chief
complaint of body swelling and pain.
.
Her symptoms began about 4 days ago with lower extremity and
abdominal swelling. She also reports diffuse body tenderness in
addition to nausea, vomiting, and subjective chills. She took
her temperature prior to coming to the hospital but said it was
less than 100.0F. The patient reports a vague chest discomfort
that comes and goes. She is bedbound at baseline.
.
On arrival to the ED, she complained of shortness of breath. She
was placed on a NRB with CXR showing mild pulmonary vascular
congestion (no edema) with mild atelectasis. She was weaned off
oxygen and was satting 93% on RA but the patient requested NC
for comfort reasons. Of note, she is an asthmatic. Pain was
controlled with morphine. A d-dimer came back positive but the
patient cannot get a CTA due to a contrast allergy. CT abdomen
was stable from prior. Troponin was negative x 1. She was
admitted to medicine for further evaluation. Transfer vitals
were HR- 71, BP- 120/84, RR- 16, SaO2- 93% on RA, 95% on 2L.
.
On arrival to the floor, vital signs were T- 97.6, BP- 112/77,
HR- 66, RR- 20, SaO2- 99% on 3L. The patient continued to
complain of diffuse body pain and swelling in her legs and
abdomen. She denied chest pain but continued to have minimal
shortness of breath. She denies change in her urine quality, RUQ
pain, rash, or cough.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2178-4-21**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
.
CTAP [**2178-4-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute abdominal pathology, especially no retroperitoneal
bleed.
2. Status post urinary diversion with ileal conduit with
prominent lower
ureters, unchanged since the prior study. Stable right renal
scarring.
3. Fibroid uterus.
4. Spina bifida with sacral meningocele, unchanged.
.
LUNG SCAN [**2178-4-22**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal lung scan.
.
LENI'S [**2178-4-22**]:
CONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT in right or left lower extremity.
.
TTE [**2178-4-23**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve is
not well seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Limited study. Preserved global left ventricular
systolic function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-9-30**],
the current study is very limited secondary to poor echo
windows/patient body habitus and limited data acquisition in the
setting of a 'Code Blue' on the patient prior to study
termination; cannot compare.
.
CXR [**2178-4-25**]:
FINDINGS:

Frontal view of the chest compared to multiple prior
examinations. There is hazy opacification of both lungs, with
possible volume overload or congestive failure. Possible
pneumonia. Heart and mediastinum within normal limits.  Mild
atelectasis at both lung bases.
.
CXR [**2178-4-25**]: LINE PLACEMENT
CLINICAL INFORMATION: New right IJ line.

Frontal view of the chest compared to multiple prior
examinations. Right IJ catheter at cavoatrial junction. Little
change since prior study, with
moderate congestive failure, interstitial prominence. Low lung
volumes.
Heart is enlarged.
.
CXR [**2178-4-28**]:
FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Right IJ catheter ends
in the lower SVC, unchanged. Since the prior study, lung volumes
are slightly improved with improvement of bibasilar atelectasis.
There is no evidence of focal consolidation. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly remains unchanged.
.
TTE [**2178-5-1**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventric
