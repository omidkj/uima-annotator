History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 20889**] is a 69 yo female with a history of cardiomyopathy,
atrial fibrillation, diabetes and heart failure who is being
transferred from OSH for management of suspected cholecystitis
with gallstone in CBD, being transferred for emergent ERCP.  She
was admitted to OSH on [**2133-6-10**] with abdominal pain, and quickly
became hypotensive.  She underwent an ultrasound exam which
showed thickened gallbladder wall and sludge and stones in the
GB.  The surgical teams strongly suspected acute cholecystitis.
The patient also had a recent HIDA scan which was suggestive of
a distal common bile duct obstruction.  She was treated with
levaquin and flagyl.  Blood cultures from OSH are NGTD.
Cardiology consult at OSH did not feel that the patient having
an acute MI.  Her anxiety and pain at OSH were difficult to
manage requiring narcotics for pain control and one point
required narcan for somnolence; she was also given presedex for
pain.  She was treated with dobutamine and lasix gtt, but lasix
was stopped due to hypotension.

The patient was transferred from OSH on vasopressin and
dobutamine.  On arrival,  her SBP was 60, HR 80 and patient was
arousable, but not mentating well.  She was not oriented and
unable to answer questions regarding history.

Review of sytems: unable to obtain secondary to mental status.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:

69 yo female with a history of cardiomyopathy, atrial
fibrillation, diabetes and heart failure transferred from OSH in
shock. Shock felt to be mixed cardiac and distributive. For
distributive shock the patient reviewed intravenous fluids with
improvement in urine output, unasyn for biliary pathology, and a
surgical consult to evaluated the need for intevention given
decompressed gallbladder with sludge. Surgery felt no need to
decompress gallbladder and recommended non-contrast CT. The CT
showed no evidence of bowel edema. The patient's abdominal pain
improved with conservative management including antibiotics, and
she was weaned off vasopressin and levophed.

For cardiogenic shock, the patient was placed on dobutamine with
improvement in blood pressure and urine output. Given the
resolution of her distributive shock, she was transferred to the
CCU for ongoing management of her cardiomyopathy and
optimization for of her cardiac status.

The patient developed acute kidney injury with Cr 2.4-2.7, and
baseline Cr 1.2-1.3, which was felt to be ATN due to hypotension
noted upon arrival to the intensive care unit. The patient's
coumadin and digoxin were held on admission due to renal failure
and possible procedures. The creatinine stabilized with volume
and pressors. The patient also had hyponatremia that improved
with fluid hydration and was likely due to intravascular volume
depletion.

CCU COURSE:
Pt was transferred from the MICU to CCU on [**6-14**] for diuresis with
ionotropic support. In the MICU, she was placed on dobutamine
and sustained 20 beat run of NSVT prior to transfer. At this
point, dobutamine was weaned and discontinued on arrival to CCU.
Levophed and Milrinone were initiated for pressor and ionotropic
support, respectively. Patient was most likely in cardiogenic
shock which may have been precipitated by aggressive fluid
resuscitation which was initiated at OSH for treatment of
probably septic shock. At CCU presentation, pt did not appear
septic, was afebrile and labs/imaging were not consistent with
an infectious etiology, so antibiotics were discontinued. She
was grossly anasarcic in the setting of fluid resuscitation and
poor forward flow, as EF 15% on TTE [**6-12**], with severe 4+ TR.
Pt was started on a lasix drip for diuresis, which was
uptitrated accordingly, up to the maximum dose of 20mg/hour. Pt
initially had poor urine output even to maximum doses of lasix,
so PO metolazone (alternating with IV diuril when no taking PO
)was added. Milrinone was also necessary. She did diurese off
about 11 liters, with no improvement in her clinical status.

When milrinone stopped, patient unable to maintain urine output
with only metolazone/diuril and lasix gtt. Patient also with
poor nutrition, intermittently hypotensive. Eventually patient's
ICD was turned off and she was moved to comfort-focused care.

Patient died on [**2133-6-27**] at 11:24am due to respiratory compromise
secondary to congestive heart failure. Other antecedent cause
was renal failure. Attending, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and hospice
