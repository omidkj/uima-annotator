Called by trauma team to evaluate patient for ICP monitor

HPI:  Pt is a 45 yo male w/ PMHx unknown PMHX who was working on
a roof and slipped landing on his head.  There was a report that
he had focal weakness on one side of his body.  He became
agitated and required intubation in the field.  It was noted
that
he had blood coming out of both ears.  The patient KUB was
concerning for free air in the abdomen.  As a result, he was
rushed to the OR where an ICP monitor was placed.  Abdomen did
not show any acute pathology.  He is currently in the TICU.

[**2161-8-26**]
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There are multiple fractures through the
left parietal,
occipital and temporal bones. There is an associated epidural
hematoma at the
left high parietal area measuring 8 mm in greatest diameter.
There are
subarachnoid hemorrhages layering over the frontal lobes
bilaterally with
hypoattenuation of the underlying brain suggesting contusion.
There is a 6 mm
subdural hematoma over the left occipital cortex measuring 6 mm
in greatest
diameter. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the posterior medial
left middle
cranial fossa is related to an adjacent fracture of the bone.
Finally there
is also a subdural or intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right
middle cranial
fossa anterior to the right temporal lobe measuring 11 mm in
diameter. High-
density blood layers along the right leaf of the falx.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved and the ventricles are normal in
size and
configuration. There is effacement of the right
perimesencephalic cisterns
suggesting right-sided uncal herniation.

Moderate opacification of the maxillary sinuses, sphenoid
sinuses and ethmoid
air cells is present. High-density material within the sphenoid
sinuses
consistent with blood.

Slightly displaced fractures through the left parietal,
occipital and temporal
bone extend into the mastoid air cells and middle ear cavity and
there is
hemotympanum. The fracture does not extend to the carotid canal.
Multiple
left occipital bone fractures extend under the cerebellum. There
is
associated pneumocephalus and air and soft tissue swelling in
the overlying
tissues. A 9 mm subgaleal hematoma layers over the left parietal
bone. An
intracranial pressure monitor is seen in the left frontal lobe.

IMPRESSION: Extensive skull base fractures and intraparenchymal,

subarachnoid, subdural and epidural hemorrhages. There is signs
of increased
intracranial pressure and right-sided uncal herniation.

[**2161-8-26**]
NON-CONTRAST CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITH CORONAL AND SAGITTAL
REFORMATS:
There are extensive skull base fractures, as described on the
prior head CT
report. There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture or
malalignment.
Vertebral body heights are maintained. There is no prevertebral
soft tissue
swelling. Prominent posterior osteophytes at C6-7 indent the
thecal sac on
the right side of the spinal canal. There is a large amount of
secretions and
blood within the oropharynx. NG tube and ET tube are in place.
The lung
apices demonstrate a chest tube overlying the left lung with a
small left
pneumothorax seen at the left lung apex. There are contusions
and asymmetric
edema in the right upper lobe with probable also partial
collapse of the right
upper lobe. There are dense atherosclerotic calcifications at
the carotid
bifurcation bilaterally. There is a comminuted fracture of the
left medial
clavicle, incompletely imaged.

IMPRESSION:

1. No cervical spine fracture or malalignment. No prevertebral
soft tissue
swelling.

2. Extensive left-sided skull base fractures as described on
concurrent CT of
the head.

3. Incompletely imaged comminuted left clavicular fracture.

4. Left chest tube and small left apical pneumothorax.

5. Right upper lobe contusions, edema, and atelectasis.

[**2161-8-26**]
CT OF THE CHEST: The heart size is normal, and there is no
pericardial
effusion or aortic injury. No mediastinal hematoma. A chest tube
is draped
over the left lung, and small- to- moderate- sized left
pneumothorax persists.
There is moderate atelectasis of the left lower lobe,
ground-glass opacities
in the left upper lobe, which may represent aspiration, and
contusions in the
right upper and lower lobes with near-complete collapse of the
right lower
lobe. The right lower lobe collapse also enhances
heterogeneously suggesting
concurrent contusion or aspiration. There is no right-sided
pneumothorax.

There are multiple fractures within the chest. These include a
comminuted
medial clavicular fracture, scapular fracture that extends to
the glenohumeral
joint and multiple left-sided rib fractures involving the
posterior and
anterior aspect of ribs two through six and only the posterior
aspect of ribs
seven through ten. No right-sided rib fractures are identified,
though there
is mild deformity of ribs four (2A, 31) five (2A, 33) as well as
old rib
fractures of ribs seven through ten on the right. No vertebral
body fractures
are identified.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver and spleen are normal. There is
extensive edema
in the gastric wall with a focal area of contrast which may
represent vascular
injury or the strange appearance of enhancing mucosa (2A, 49).
This area is
located in the fundus of the stomach and does not change in size
or
configuration on the 6-minute delayed scan suggesting that this
is not an
extravasation. An NG tube courses through the stomach,
terminating in the
antrum. The gallbladder, adrenal glands and kidneys are normal.
There is
edema in the small bowel wall, likely from fluid resuscitation.
The colon
appears unremarkable. The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber.

CT OF THE PELVIS: There is a moderate amount of free fluid in
the pelvis,
likely related to the lavage performed during recent laparotomy.
