Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent tracheobronchomalacia after tracheoplasty and re-do.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
flex. bronch, thoracotomy, tracheoplasty, removal of posterior
mesh @trachea, tracheobronchoplasty [**3-22**], takeback for R.
hemothorax [**3-24**]


History of Present Illness:
 The patient is a delightful 55-year-old woman who has had a
right thoracotomy with tracheobronchoplasty with mesh. She had
an excellent result for several years until she began developing
a recurrent, intractable cough. This progressed and associated
dyspnea on exertion developed. A bronchoscopy confirmed the
presence of recurrent distal tracheomalacia, proximal left main
tracheomalacia and the right main and bronchus intermedius
malacia. There was also the development of cervical malacia. She
recently underwent a cervical tracheal resection and
reconstruction with a tightening of the posterior membranous
wall. She had a reasonably good result with improvement in both
cough and dyspnea. However, she does continue to have an
intractable cough and dyspnea on exertion.

RADIOLOGY:
[**3-22**] CXR: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Two
right-sided chest tubes are in place. A tiny right basilar
pneumothorax is suspected, which is unsurprising given the
recent postoperative context. Adjacent subcutaneous emphysema is
also present and expected. The patient is status post prior
costotomies at the level of the fifth and sixth right ribs
(posterior archs). A small amount of pleural fluid is suspected
at the right apex. Trace atelectases are seen bilaterally.

[**3-23**] CXR: Interval partial pullback of one chest tube, with its
tip now at the right lung base.  Worsening bilateral
atelectasis, especially on the right.  Increasing right pleural
effusion adjacent to the lung apex

[**3-24**] CXR: Two chest tubes are present in the right hemithorax
terminating at the right apex. Previously present large right
pleural effusion has nearly resolved, and there is a new
small-to-moderate basilar pneumothorax present. Widening of
right mediastinal contour is present and may reflect medially
loculated pleural fluid or mediastinal hematoma. This has
improved compared to the preoperative radiograph. Improved
aeration of the right lung is noted with residual atelectasis,
predominantly in the right middle and lower lobes and to a
lesser degree centrally in the right upper lobe. New hazy
opacities have developed in the left perihilar region and may
reflect asymmetric edema or aspiration.

[**3-25**] CXR: Since the recent radiograph of several hours earlier,
there has been no substantial change in a loculated
hydropneumothorax with two chest tubes in place. Multifocal
alveolar opacities involving the left upper, bilateral mid and
right lower lung region have progressed in may be due to
multifocal asymmetrical edema given waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] present on
recent serial radiographs. Aspiration is an additional
consideration. Widening of right mediastinal contour is without
change compared to recent postoperative radiographs.

[**3-26**] CXR: Comparison with [**2156-3-25**]. The two right chest
tubes are unchanged in position. There appears to be a mild
increase in the right hydropneumothorax, which was known to be
loculated. There is now more fluid component. The multifocal
alveolar opacities involving the left upper lobe, bilateral mid
and right lower lung zones, had increased slightly, and likely
due to multifocal asymmetric edema, given the time course of
change. Aspiration is also a consideration. There is stable
widening of the mediastinal contour in this postoperative
patient.

[**3-28**] CXR: PA and lateral chest compared to moderate loculated
right pleural abnormality along the lateral, upper mediastinal
and posterior pleural surfaces has remained unchanged since
[**3-27**] following removal of previous right pleural drains.
There is no pneumothorax. Appreciable atelectasis at the right
base is unchanged causing elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
The left lung shows linear atelectasis and vascular engorgement.
The heart is normal size. There is no pneumothorax. Colonic
distension is noted in the right upper abdominal quadrant, but
there is no peritoneal free air.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5514**] was admitted and taken to the OR for :
1.  Flexible bronchoscopy.
2.  Right redo thoracotomy with removal of Marlex mesh and
    redo tracheoplasty.
3.  Redo right main bronchoplasty.
4.  Redo proximal left main bronchoplasty.
5.  Adjacent pleural flap to airway
Please see operative notes for details of procedure.
An epidural was placed for pain control and a PCA. She was
extubated immediately post-operatively.  She was admitted to the
ICU for monitoring and aggressive pulmonary care.  Two right
chest tubes were in place and to suction with a moderate amount
bloody drainage. She was maintained on IV clinda for mesh.  She
underwent a bronchoscopy on POD#1 for assessment of the repair
and for clean out of secretions.
Her post-operative course was complicated by development of a
right hemothorax requiring transfusions and return to the OR on
POD# 2 for evacuation of the hemothorax.  Chest tube drainage
was minimal and her Hematocrit remained stable. Chest tubes were
removed on [**3-27**]. She progressed well with rehabilitation and was
cleared for discharge home with continued oxygen.
