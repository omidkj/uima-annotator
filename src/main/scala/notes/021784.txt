CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2166-5-18**] 10:29 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: S/P FALL, SAH, ? SAH PROGRESSION

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
56 year old man with fall and SAH
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? SAH progression
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 56-year-old male with fall and intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. Evaluate for progression.

COMPARISON: [**2166-5-8**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast CT of the head.

FINDINGS: The previously seen multiple intraparenchymal
hemorrhages within the left frontal lobe have markedly decreased
in size consistent with evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is residual hypodensity surrounding this region creating
similar mass effect as prior likely representing edema. There is
mild rightward subfalcine herniation of the left frontal lobe,
is unchanged. Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage also has
slightly decreased within the region of the left cerebral
convexity. No new evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Persistent opacification of the right maxillary sinus. Improved
aeration of the left maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus and sphenoid
sinuses. Mastoid air cells are mildly opacified and unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Evolving left parenchymal hemorrhage with greater component
of edema and decreased component of hemorrhage. Similar mass
effect.
2. Interval decrease in left cerebral convexity subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

Sinus rhythm
- borderline first degree A-V block
Left axis deviation - anterior fascicular block
Mild prolonged QT interval
Clinical correlation is suggested

  CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2166-5-5**] 7:12 PM

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Please eval c/spine injury

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
41 year old man s/p fall w/ confusion & blood at rt ext ear
canal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval c/spine injury
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 41-year-old man status post fall with confusion,
blood in right external ear canal. Please evaluate C-spine
injury.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial CT imaging of the cervical spine
with coronal and sagittal reformats was reviewed.

FINDINGS: Prevertebral soft tissue swelling may be secondary to
endotracheal intubation. No fractures are identified. Vertebral
body alignment is anatomic. Facet joint alignment is normal.
There is some spurring about the axial-atlanto articulation.
Small amount of degenerative disease seen in the cervical spine
suggest anterior osteophyte at C7. Thyroid cartilage is
calcified.

A consolidation is present within the right upper lobe but
incompletely evaluated on this cervical spine CT. Some
emphysematous changes are also identified at the apices.

IMPRESSION: Prevertebral soft tissue swelling may be secondary
to intubation. No fractures are identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. Neurosurgery was
immediately consulted because of his injuries; his injuries were
non-operative. He was loaded with Dilantin and will need to
continue this for a total of 3 months; he will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Neurosurgery in 3 months for a repeat head CT scan.

ENT was consulted because of bleeding in his ear canal; he was
treated conservatively with antibiotic ear drops. he will need
an outpatient audiogram in the next 2-3 weeks.

Behavioral Neurology was also consulted because of his traumatic
brain injury and made several recommendations regarding his
medications. He initially required 1;1 sitters and restraints
because of behavioral problems. His sitters have been
discontinued for several days now. He was placed on prn Ativan
initially for CIWA protocol and required standing doses of
Ativan as well. This seemed to contribute to delirium. The
Ativan was weaned slowly and has been discontinued. He remains
on Haldol 2.5 [**Hospital1 **]; this dose was just decreased from tid. There
have been no further behavioral issues at this time.

A PEG was placed to provide nutritional support given patient's
mental status early during his hospital stay. He is now
tolerating a regular diet without any difficulties. His PEG can
be removed in the next 2-3 weeks in Trauma clinic if he
continues to tolerates po solids.

Physical and Occupational therapy have also worked with patient
and have recommended short rehab stay.

Social work also was involved in the care of patient during his
hospital stay. Case management worked closely with patient in
finding rehab placement. Plans were underway to discharge pati
net to [**Hospital **] Hospital; on [**2166-5-23**] patient left the hospital
without formally being discharged.
