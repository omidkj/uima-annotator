Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath for past five days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
79 year old male with HTN, DMII, systolic heart failure (EF 45%)
and CVA ([**2101**], [**2121**]) with residual right hemiplegia and
dysarthria presenting for dyspnea for five days.  The patient
became somnolent with fever of 100.0 and hypoxia to 89%RA on [**2-10**]
while at his nursing home.  CXR showed LL opacity and WBC 30.7,
and he was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg po daily x10 days and
albuterol nebulizers but continued to have fevers.  The day of
admission, [**2-13**], he was noted to have increased work of
breathing and fever of 102.5, and was sent from rehab by EMS.
He was placed on CPAP at 10/5 with ~6-7 liters of minute
ventilation in the ED and given Vanc/Levaquin, and weaned down
to 4L NC.  He was admitted to the MICU for possible non-invasive
ventilation, but remained stable from a respiratory standpoint.
CXR showed retrocardiac opacity compared to CXR [**12-31**].  He was
also found to have acute renal failure with Cr 2.5 from baseline
0.7 last year, hyperkalemia 5.7, and hyperglycemia 485.
VBG: 7.34/49/38 with lactate of 3.4, which improved with 2L NS.
CT abd/pelvis showed non-obstructing renal calculus, tree and
[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in lung bases, ?consolidation of LLB and the
patient was switched to Meropenem with improvement.  C. diff and
UA were negative.  ARF also improved with IVF and hypernatremia
improved with increase of FW flushes through the G-tube.  He was
called out to the medicine floor for further management.
.
Also, the patient had G-tube replaced on [**2124-2-10**] due to
blockage without complications and without residuals since the
replacement.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2124-1-5**] -
[**2124-1-6**] for clogged G-tube and IR replacement and [**2123-12-18**]
- [**2124-1-4**] for hypoxic respiratory failure in the setitng of
H. flu pneumonia requiring intubation with hospital course
complicated by upper GI bleed from G-tube site and C. difficile
infection.
.
Currently, the patient remains non-verbal and does not follow
commands, which per the MICU team seems to be chronic.
.
Review of systems: Patient is nonverbal at baseline. Unable to
obtain ROS.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old male with HTN, DMII, systolic heart failure (EF 45%)
and CVA ([**2101**], [**2121**]) with residual right hemiplegia and
dysarthria presenting for dyspnea [**1-6**] pneumonia, also in ARF.
.
#. Pneumonia:  Five days prior to admission, the patient became
somnolent with fever of 100.0 and hypoxia to 89%RA on [**2-10**] while
at his nursing home.  CXR showed LL opacity and WBC 30.7, and he
was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg po daily x10 days and
albuterol nebulizers but continued to have fevers.  The day of
admission, [**2-13**], he was noted to have increased work of
breathing and fever of 102.5, and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehab
by EMS.  He was placed on CPAP at 10/5 with ~6-7 liters of
minute ventilation in the ED and given Vanc/Levaquin, and weaned
down to 4L NC.  He was admitted to the MICU for possible
non-invasive ventilation, but remained stable from a respiratory
standpoint.  CXR showed retrocardiac opacity compared to CXR
[**12-31**].  CT chest showed cetrilobular nodules and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
appearances at bases consistent with aspiration PNA, failed
outpatient Levofloxacin treatment, broadened in-house to
Meropenem first on [**2-13**], and Vancomycin subsequently added on
[**2-15**] for persistent white count.  Cultures remained negative,
with two blood cultures pending on discharge.  He was discharged
with on an 8 day course of Meropenem (last day [**2-20**]) and
Vancomycin (last day [**2-22**]) for HCAP.  Given his sinus
tachycardia, his albuterol nebulizer was switched to Xopenex
nebulizers q4h standing and he was started on Ipratropium q6h
standing, given he had significant wheezing and tachypnea.  His
respiratory symptoms improved with antibiotics and nebulizers.
.
#. Fever/C. difficile colitis:  The patient was afebrile for
several days following initiation of Vancomycin, but began
having low grade fevers on [**2-15**].  UA negative, initial C. diff
negative, initial CT abdomen negative although without contrast.
 He was re-cultured, and the second C. diff study on [**2-16**]
returned positive.  He was started on PO Vancomycin with
decrease and subsequent resolution of his leukocytosis.  He was
constipated rather than having diarrhea, which is likely an
atypical but well known presentation of a C. difficile
infection.  LENI's were checked in the setting of fever,
tachycardia, and mild LLE edema, and was negat
