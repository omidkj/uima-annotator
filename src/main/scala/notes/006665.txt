Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2-29**]: Emergent R craniotomy for SDH evacuation


History of Present Illness:
78 year old male on coumadin who was standing on a stool
adjusting his curtain
when he slipped and fell backwards hitting his head without loss
of consiousness at approx 1100 am on [**2128-2-29**].  He proceeded to
visit one of his 3 daughters and at 3pm complained of a headache
and headed home.  At approximately 430 pm another daughter
called the patient at home and stated that the patient was
consfused. She immediately went to Mr [**Known lastname 86548**] house and found
him to be confused, feeling "cold", complaining of a headace
with extreme
fatigue.  The daughter called 911 and the patient was brought by
EMS to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  At [**Hospital **] Hospital, the patient had
imaging that was consistent with large right sided SDH.  He was
reversed with 2 units FFP and vitamin K.  The patient then
experienced an acute mental status decline and was emergently
intubated and brought here for further management.  This HPI was
obtained from three daughters present at the time of patient
admission.  The patient was non responive and intubated
onarrival to the ED.

Head CT [**2-29**]
IMPRESSION: Large right-sided acute on chronic subdural hematoma
measuring up to 1.7 cm in maximum thickness. Significant
leftward shift of midline
structures of 1.3 cm. Early right uncal herniation with
entrapment of the
right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].

Head CT [**3-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Redistribution of the intracranial extra-axial pneumocephalus
with new air anterior to the left frontal lobe and decreased air
anterior to the right temporal lobe.
2. Unchanged right frontoparietal extra-axial air and
extra-axial
frontoparietal fluid collection at the prior subdural hematoma
evacuation
site.
3. Unchanged 1.3-cm midline shift to the left, right
perimesencephalic
cistern effacement and right cerebral edema.
4. Increase width of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], possibly secondary
to left
foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] compression. Followup CT exam for monitoring is
recommended.

Head CT [**3-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged postsurgical right epidural collection. Slightly
decreased anterior frontal right subdural collection, with
increased
fluid to air ratio. Unchanged small residual subdural hematoma
along the
right occipital convexity, medial right occipital lobe, and
right tentorium.
2. Subtle progressive effacement of the right perimesencephalic
cistern
since [**2-29**]. Presence of subtle right uncal herniation is
difficult to
determine at this time.
3. Unchanged effacement of the right lateral and third
ventricles.
Unchanged enlargement of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].

MRI Head [**3-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. A few small scattered foci of decreased diffusion, in the
splenium of the corpus callosum and in the left occipital
parasagittal cortex and a tiny focus in the right temporal lobe
which may represent acute-subacute infarcts.
2. Fluid collection in the right side of the head along the
cerebral
convexity, in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes,
representing
previously known chronic subdural hematoma, with some areas of
persistent
hemorrhage within. Significant mass effect on the right cerebral
hemisphere with shift of midline structures to the left by 1.4
cm and right-sided uncal herniation
3. While there is no obvious and definite increased signal
intensity in the brainstem structures, there is some deformity
of the mid brain related to the mass effect and subtle increased
T2 signal in the cervicomedullary junction, which is not
conformed on other sequences. Significance of this finding is
uncertain.
4. Paranasal sinus disease as well as diffuse mucosal
thickening/fluid in the mastoid air cells on both sides.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken emergently from the ED to the operating
room where he underwent a R craniotomy for evacuation of the
hematoma.  He tolerated the procedure well, and was transferred
to the ICU where he reamined intubated.  A post op head CT
demonstrated a good amount of pneumocephalus, but no acute
hemorrhage. He was initially able to move all extremities, R>L,
and followed simple commands.

On POD #1, he was extubated, and was found to be slightly more
difficult to arouse.  A CT was performed, which demonstrated a
slight increase in his midline shift (~1mm) but no hemorrhage or
increase in the pneumocephalus.

On POD #2, [**3-2**], he devloped an increased work of breathing; he
was subsequently re-intubated.  His neurological exam worsened,
as he exhitibed minimally reactive pupils and extensure
posturing of upper and lower extremities. Head CT showed
increase in edema. Mannitol was given.

MRI Brain was ordered on [**3-4**]. This showed normal cerebral
perfusion. He remained intubated with a poor neurological
examination. A family mtg was conducted on [**3-5**], and he was made
DNR/DNI.

On [**3-6**] after a family discussion he was made comfort measures
only and extubated at approximately 130pm. At approximately 7pm
the patient expired in the surgical ICU.
