Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10843**] is a 55 year old man with recently diagnosed dilated
cardiomyopathy (EF 30%), current tobacco use and past IV drug
and alcohol abuse (clean x10 years) who p/w progressive
shortness of breath.
.
The patient was in his USOH until a few months ago when he
noticed increasing shortness of breath during his regular
weight-training exercise circuit.  While he used to be able to
do several sets without stopping, he soon found that he needed
to stop every few sets to catch his breath.  While he used to be
able to walk indefinitely, he now doubts that he could go for
more than a mile.  The episodes of shortness of breath have not
been associated with any chest pain.  Over the past few weeks he
has also begun to notice PND and orthopnea, although he denies
any lower extremity edema or recent weight gain (baseline weight
173-175).  He reports a nonproductive cough, but notes that he
has it chronically and that it's likely related to his smoking.
He denies any recent fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or
palpitations.
.
Over the past ~2 weeks he has also experienced periodic episodes
of chest pain that are unrelated in time to his episodes of
shortness of breath.  He describes the pain as "burning," and
notes that it's located in the mid-epigastric area.  The
episodes of pain last varying amounts of time (5 - 30 minutes).
The pain does not radiate, and is not associated with any
lightheadedness, diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting.  He notes that
the pain is similar to his reflux pain, and that it typically
improves with food or drink.
.
Finally, the patient notes that he has had "eye waviness" for
"the longest time."  Approximately 2 months ago he "went blind
in one eye" while waiting in line at a store.  It is unclear
what workup was pursued at that time but an ultrasound of his
carotids was normal.  Last week he experienced an episode of
"eye blurriness" while he was working to fix an air conditioner;
it lasted about 15 minutes.  In both cases, the eye symptoms
have not been associated with any headache, aura, chest pain or
shortness of breath, but he does recall some lightheadedness.
.
On the floor the patient complained of some epigastric pain but
notes that it was imrpoving as he ate.  He denied any shortness
of breath or eye symptoms.

Past Medical History:
Dilated cardiomyopathy: Recent stress ECHO with EF 30%, global
hypokinesis, no wall motion abnormalities.
h/o substance abuse (see below)

Social History:
The patient lives in [**Location 4628**] with his wife, although he notes
that the marriage is not a particularly good one.  He works in
floor covering.  He has an extensive history of substance abuse.
 Before going clean approximately 10 years ago, he used use
heroin, cocaine, marijuana and percocets while also drinking 24
beers plus hard alcohol daily.  He has not had any alcohol or
illicit drugs since quitting 10 years ago.  He is a current
smoker (2ppd x ~30 years) but expresses interest in quitting.

Extensive family history of substance abuse

.
CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly but appearance suggestive of
underlying pericardial effusion.  Slight redistribution of upper
lung zone pulmonary vasculature without overt evidence of CHF.
No focal consolidations, pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2174-7-11**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
deminstarted no evidence of epicardial coronary artery disease.
The
LMCA was patent. The LAD was patent and demonatrated a distal
myocardial
bridge.  The LCX and the RCA were both widely patent.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed a severely elevated right and
left
sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 26 mm Hg and LVEDP of 28
mm Hg.
The cardiac index was severely depressed at 1.3 l/min/m2.  There
was a
central aortic hypotension wuth SBP of 88-90 mm Hg. Dobutamine
infusion
at 5 mcg/kg/min was started.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. A yellow VIP PA line was placed in the lab for close
hemodynamic
monitoring and a tailored therapy in the CCU.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
4. Severely depressed cardiac index.
5. Central aortic hypotension.
.
ECHO [**2174-7-13**]
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis with relative sparing of the basal
lateral and inferolateral hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 55 year old man with recently diagnosed
dilated non ischemic CMP (EF 15-20%), current tobacco use and
past IV drug and alcohol abuse (clean x 10 years) who presented
with progressive shortness of breath, found to have clean
coronaries on catheterization, with development of hypotension
in the lab, admitted to CCU for tailored therapy.
.
# [**Name (NI) 4964**] Pt with newly diagnosed CHF/cardiomyopathy of unclear
etiology who presented for catheterization to evaluate for
ischemic disease.  In the cath lab he was found to have normal
coronaries, however did have elevated left and right sided
pressures.  He was also noted to be hypotensive which did
require pressors.  Because he was initally dobutamine dependent,
he was transferred to the CCU.  The dobutamine was quickly
titrated off and BP remained in the low 100's.  He was then
restarted on his CHF regimen including metoprolol, [**Last Name (un) **], lasix.
Repeat ECHO showed dilated cardiomyopathy with severe global HK
and EF of 15-20% without valve disease.  EP was consulted for
possible ICD placement.  Given the new diagnosis they would like
further work-up and evaluation.  At time of discharge he had
several tests pending including HIV, SPEP.  His TSH was normal,
as was ferritin.  Possible causes for his cardiomyopathy now
that ischemia and valvehas been ruled out includes alcholic
induced(former heavy ETOH use),
