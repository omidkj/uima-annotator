History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 47367**] is a 52 year old man with no major medical problems
who presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath and
worsening dyspnea on exertion. For the past month, he has
noticed increased bruising, and for the past week, he has
noticed nosebleeds at night and bleeding gums, as well as
ulcerations on his tongue. He developed progressive dyspnea on
exertion, which prompted an admission to [**Hospital **] Hospital, at
which time his hematocrit was noted to be 16. He received 4
units of pRBC's and his bone marrow was aspirated (results
pending). He was discharged home and told his bone marrow
results would be available on Tuesday. The day prior to
admission at [**Hospital1 18**], he complained of worsened dyspnea and
band-like chest pain across his chest, at which time his wife
insisted that he come to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
He denies recent weight loss, but has noticed a low-grade
temperature over the past week, along with night sweats, chills,
and diffuse abdominal pain (no associated nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea). He has had a headache which responds to ibuprofen.
During his hospitalization at [**Hospital **] Hospital, he developed a
rash after receiving a blood transfusion. He has also noticed a
non-tender ulceration on his penis, which developed within the
last week. His wife notes that his color has improved
dramatically since receiving the blood transfusions.


Past Medical History:
s/p multiple back surgeries, including cervical spinal fusion
s/p basal cell carcinoma removal
Nephrolithiasis
Hypercholesterolemia
Had cardiac cath in [**2134**] (per report, was "clean", after failing
multiple thallium stress tests)
Chronic numbness and neuropathic pain of left upper
extremity/chest

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 14840**] with his wife. They have three children (ages
24, 22, and 18). He works as a technician for [**Company 22957**], with some
exposure to lead; crawls around office buildings and below
houses and may have had asbestos exposure. + tobacco history (1
ppd x "many" years, not currently). Social EtOH, no drugs.
Sexually active with one partner, wife, no extramarital sexual
exposures. No previous STD's.


Family History:
Mother died suddenly in her 70's, father died of cancer, unknown
type (with visible tumors across his body). One sister with
thyroid cancer, brother with diabetes, sister with [**Name (NI) 5895**]
Disease.

Pertinent Results:
.
CXR [**3-31**]: CHEST, TWO VIEWS: No prior for comparisons. Cardiac,
mediastinal, and hilar contours are within normal limits. Linear
atelectasis is seen at the left lung base. Mild blunting of the
left costophrenic angle is also seen. Right costophrenic angle
appears clear. Splenic shadow is not well identified. No
pneumothorax. No fractures are seen. IMPRESSION: Linear
atelectasis left lung base and probable tiny left pleural
effusion.
.
CXR [**4-1**]: Comparison with the previous study done on [**2143-3-31**].
Minimally increased streaky density at the left base appears
more confluent than on the earlier study. The heart and
mediastinal structures are unremarkable in appearance as before.
The bony thorax is grossly intact. IMPRESSION: Minimally
increased density at the left base which may represent evolving
pneumonia. Follow up recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 47367**] is a 52 year old male with no major past medical
history who presented with dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and
easy bruisability, and was found to be pancytopenic.  He was
intially admitted to the general medicine team. The morning
after admission the pt triggered for a drop in SaO2 to 83% RA.
He came up to 95% on 4L. CXR showed possible LLL PNA. The pt was
started on cefepime. As his peripheral smear showed blasts, he
was then transferred to the BMT service.  On the day of
admission to the BMT service ([**2143-4-3**]) he complained of chest
pain and had diffuse ST elevations on EKG. Stat ECHO showed a
pericardial effusion although he had no pulsus paradoxus.  He
was dgiven oxygen and transferred to the cath lab for urgent
pericardiocentesis. They removed over 300mL of fluid and those
cultures were negative.  He then recovered in the MICU. His
pericardial drain was removed the next day.  He was then
transferred back to the BMT service.

# pericardial effusion/tamponade:  As described above, ECHO
showed these results. He underwent a pericardiocentesis to drain
the fluid and it did not reacumulate based on several
surveillence ECHOs.

# pleural effusion: left sided.  This was thought to be related
to malignancy and to his initially pericardial effusion. The
pleural effusion persisted throughout admission.  He had a
diagnostic thorocentesis by IP which removed 30ml of bloody
fluid.  No infectious source was found in the fluid.

# AML: (M7). He was intially given 7+3 idarubicin and cytarabine
chemotherapy to induce remission with the plan to have a donor
allo transplant.  His day 14 bone marrow showed continued
hypercellular marrow.  He was reinduced with HIDAC on [**4-22**].
His counts continued to remain very low for an extended period
of time.  His course was complicated by febrile neutropenia.  He
was started on cefepime but developed a rash. This was biopsied
by dermatology and found to be a drug rash.  He was switched to
aztreonam and continued to spike temps. More antibiotics were
added including vancomycin, levofloxacin and several different
antifungals including caspofungin, micafungin, voriconazole,
posaconazole, ambisome.  He had several reactions to these
antifungals including rash (likely with caspofungin and
micafungin) and elevated LFTs. As his counts returned, a repeat
bone marrow preliminarily showed a sick marrow but no obvious
evidence of leukemia.  The antibiotics were pealed back and he
was discharged on voriconazole alone (see details below).  He
also developed mucositis which required morphine PCA and TPN for
malnutrition.  On the day of discharge, he was told that a bone
marrow donor was likely found.

# suspected fungal pneumonia: He continued to spike temperatures
on several antibiotics. All of his cultures were negative. His
chest CT and xrays showed patchy infiltrates.  A beta glucan
retured at 161; galactomanin was negative. Pulmonary and ID were
following as consult teams. THe patient had a BAL which was
negative except for 3 colonies of yeast among large amounts of
oral flora. The yeast was thought to be contamination per
pathology.  Given the elevated beta glucan and the fact that he
defervesced on antifungal therapy, it was thought that he likely
had a fungal infection and was discharged on voriconazole.

#) Elevated LFTs:  This was attributed to his antifungal
therapies.  He seemed to have elevations with posaconazole and
ambisome the most. He was sent out on voriconazole. He had two
MRIs of the liver (one while still neutropenic and one after his
counts recovered) to rule out obvious fungal infections in the
liver; both were negative.
