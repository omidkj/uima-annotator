Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
epigastric pain, incidental AAA identified, transfered from OSH
for assessment of surgical intervention upon AAA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yom presented to OSH with epigastric pain,
shortness of breath, cough and chills, s/p fall on his right
chest with ecchymosis, diagnosed OSH with possible NSTEMI (BNP
of 1100, TropT of 0.09, 0.13, 0.13), PNA, CHF with EF of 25%,
and AAA (6.7x6.5 cm). At OSH ED, he was noted to have ecchymosis
on the right chest, unable to lie flat and was hypotensive.  He
was urgently intubated to perform CT scans of the chest and
abdomen. CT scan showed a 6.7x6.5 infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm with no suggestion of acute leakage or bleed and
bibasilar atelectasis vs airway disease.  ECG showed ST
depression in V2 & V3 and prominent T-waves diffusely, RBBB, 1st
degree AV block.
.
At the OSH ([**Hospital6 33**]), patient was treated for
pneumonia with Zosyn and levaquin.  He was intubated for 1 day
duration.  His cultures were reportedly unremarkable.  He was
evaluated by cardiology due to his extensive coronary artery
disease.  On the OSH echo, he was noted to have a depressed EF
of 20-25% which was noted to be worse than prior reports (at
[**Hospital6 10353**]).  Patient did have several episodes of
acute pulmonary edema that was with increased BB, diuresis,
ACEI, and BiPAP.  He was evaluated by surgery for the newly
discovered abdominal aortic aneurysm, which he was recommened to
have endovascular repair.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
catheterization and management of AAA repair evaluation.
.
On review of systems, he has a persistent non-productive cough.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, abdominal pain, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems was negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea (sleeps with 1
pillow at night), ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

TTE [**5-25**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid-distal anterior
wall, apex, and distal anterior septum (LVEF 35-40%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate focal left ventricular dysfunction c/w
CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild dilatation of the aortic
root.
.
CXR [**5-25**]:
Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged.
Small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, are
stable. There are
bilateral extensive pleural plaques. Right PICC remains in place
in standard position. There is mild vascular congestion,
minimally increased. Bibasilar opacities are consistent with
atelectasis. The sternal wires are aligned with unchanged
fracture of the first wire. Patient is status post CABG. There
areno new lung abnormalities or evident pneumothorax.

CTA [**5-29**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable appearance of 6.9 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm with no
evidence of contained or impending rupture. Imaging surveillance
is recommended if other intervention is not performed.
Additionally, there is a right internal iliac aneurysm.
2. 2.0 x0.8 cm cystic lesion within the tail of the pancreas,
with a second in the pancreatic head which s
