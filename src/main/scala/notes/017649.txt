Endoscopy: grade 1 varix with diffuse oozing in esophagus,
mouth, stomoch, no discrete site of bleeding.
.
Eccho: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The increased
transaortic
gradient is likely related to high stroke volume. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
7 yo M w/HCV cirrhosis, ESLD-MELD 49, HRS, hepatic
encephalopathy vs. worsening uremia, p/w worsening mental status
who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of liver
transplant.
.
#. Liver: Mr [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] evaluation and testing by transplant
hepatology, transplant surgery, infectious diseases for
conisderation of liver transplantation.  He was ultimately felt
to be in too poor health to be considered for transplantation
with hepatorenal syndrome, advaced liver disease with severe
coagulopathy and encephalopathy and overwhelming infection.  He
was found on transfer to have both VRE bacteremia and
periotonitis which would automatically make him ineligable for
transplant for at least 14 days until his infection had been
adequately treated.  He received aggressive care including
rifaxamin and lactulose for encephalopathy, Enteral tube feeds
for nutrition, antibiotics for bacteremia/peritonitis,
midodrine, octreotide, albumin and dialysis for HRS, and many
blood products for bleeding.  He unfortunately decompensated
with critical bleeding and overwhelming infection and the
decision was made by the transplant hepatologists and surgeons
that he was not a transplant candidate and his care was
redirected toward comfort.  (see below)
.
# Infection: Mr [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] diagnostic paracentesis which
showed increased number of WBC (1100 with 71% PMN) and was found
to have grown out VRE in both peritoneal fluid and blood
cultures the day prior to transfer.  He was started on meropenem
and linezolid whch was then chagned to meropenem and daptomycin
due to concern over worsening thrombocytopenia.
.
# ARF: Pt w/normal baseline Cr. 0.8 1 month ago who presented in
HRS.  Mr [**Known lastname **] was treated with octreotide/midodrine/albumin at
maximal doses.  Nephrology was consulted and felt that he needed
dialysis for uremia and volume overload as a bridge to
transplantation.  H Rt femoral HD catheter was placed without
complications but unfortunately persistantly bled despite no
obvious defects in the catheter positioning or suturing.  (see
below).  He [**Known lastname 1834**] HD x 1 before the decision was made to
change the goals of care to comfort
.
# Coagulopathy/bleeding: Mr [**Known lastname **] had extremely advanced cirrhosis
with MELD of 49 and severe coagulopathy (INR 5.5 on admission).
He had significant bleeding complicatoins at [**Hospital1 2177**] (hemothorax,
LGIB).  At [**Hospital1 18**] he was initially hemodynamically stable but
began persistantly oozing from around his HD catheter site.
THis was unable to be reversed with aggressive FFP,
cryoprecipitate, DDAVP, topical thrombin, amicar, and platelet
transfustion.  He required near 12 units of blood over 1 day for
this problem.  In addition he was found to have a massive GIB
with spurting of dark purple blood from his rectum.  NG lavage
was performed which showed clots but no active bleeding.  He was
intubated for airway protection, hepatology emergently perfomed
upper endoscopy in the middle of the night and found grade 1
varices with diffuse oozing but no discrete site of bleeding.
Transplant surgery was also involved. He was started on an
octreotide drip.  He required 12 units of blood.  The family was
called in and given his overall exremely advanced ESLD,
overwhelming infectin, and diffuse oozing it was felt that liver
transplantation would be inappropriate as would any invasive
procedures given his profuse bleeding.  He was supported with
blood products overnight and another family meeting was held the
next day and it was decided to redirect his care toward comfort
measures.  He continued to receive antibiotics and was
mechanically ventilated but blood products were withheld.
.
Over the course of multiple days, Mr. [**Known lastname 46293**] blood pressure and
heart rate began to decrease.  He remained sedated and on the
ventilator.  On [**2159-1-12**] at 1505, an asystolic rhythm was noted
on the monitor.  An examination was preformed, noting no  heart
sounds, no pulse, and non-reactive pupils.  Mr. [*
