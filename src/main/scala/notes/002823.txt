Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the trauma ICU for close monitoring
and management.

N: She was initially intubated and sedated. When sedation was
weaned, she was appropriately responsive, moving all
extremities, following commands. Neurosurgery was consulted, she
was initially kept on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis per
recommendations, and will follow up with an outpatient CT scan
in four weeks. Plastic surgery was consulted for her facial
lacerations and facial fractures. Ophtho was consulted for her
orbital fracture. OMFS was consulted for her mandibular
fracture. She was given peridex mouthwashes. Her intra-oral
laceration and facial lacerations were sutured by plastic
surgery. She was given narcotic medication for pain control. She
was taken to the OR on [**9-3**] by OMFS for her mandibular fracture
and underwent ---

CV: She remained hemodynamically stable. She was placed on
methadone [**Hospital1 **] for her tachycardia, which improved.

Pulm: She was initially intubated for airway protection. She was
weaned off the vent and successfully extubated. She was febrile
on HD1 and sputum cultures were sent, which grew strep pneumo.
She was started on ceftriaxone and switched to azithromycin.

GI: Once extubated, she was placed on a soft mechanical diet.
She was on a bowel regimen.

Heme: Her hematocrit remained stable

ID: Her sputum grew strep pneumo and 1 of 2 blood culture
bottles grew strep pneumo as well. She was placed on
azithromycin [**2142-9-1**], with a planned 7 day course. She remained
afebrile for the rest of her ICU course. A sexual assault screen
was done and she was given a dose of metronidazole,
azithromycin, and ceftriaxone on [**2142-8-30**]. She was HCV positive as
well and given HIV post-exposure prophylaxis.

On [**2142-9-4**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room with OMFS
for ORIF of her mandibular fracture and removal of her two
mandibular incisors.  She was recovered in the PACU and
transferred to Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the surgical floor.
  She was continued on azithromycin for a total course of four
days.  Pain was controlled with narcotic and non-narcotic
analgesics.  Methadone was also started due to patient's history
of opioid dependence.

The patient's diet was ordered as full liquids and she will
continue to follow that diet until she follows up with OMFS as
an outpatient.  She was started on subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.

During her inpatient stay, plastics, opthalmology, neurosurgery,
and OMFS were consulted for various issues.  Folllow up
appointments have been made with all those services as an
outpatient basis within the next month of discharge.  Because
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] continues on anti-retroviral therapy, a follow-up
appointment  was also made with Infectious Disease within the
upcoming week.

Social Work has made plans for the patient to attend a methadone
clinic.  As part of that arrangement, prescriptions for
narcotics were only administered to cover the patient until her
first visit to the clinic, which is [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**9-10**].  Social
work also made arrangements for the patient to [**Hospital1 12671**].

At the time of discharge, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was hemodynamically stable
and afebrile.  She has finished her course of antibiotics.  All
necessary prescriptions have been provided and discharge
instructions have been provided by myself and the bedside nurse.
 The patient was being discharged with the assistance/care of
her sister.
