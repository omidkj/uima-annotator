CC:  Abdominal pain

HPI:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 yo woman with history of
hypertension, possible CKD, prior CCY ([**2089**]), here from [**Hospital1 5979**] with pancreatits, after she presented there with
abdominal pain.  She in fact developed abdominal pain 10 days
ago, on good [**Hospital1 2974**], and presented to LGH.  She was discharged
from the ED.  She was called back for possible pulmonary edema,
and to rule out MI, which was negative.

After discharge, she continued to have abdominal pain, with
nausea and anorexia.  The pain has been constant, throughout her
entire abdomen, and radiating to her back.  The pain was not
relieved by tylenol.  She has had shortness of breath with the
pain.  She had dark urine, but no changes in her stool.  She has
not had fevers, but has had chills.

Prior to the onset of pain, she had been taking protein shakes,
substituting for one meal a day, for weight loss.  She lost 7
lbs.

She has intermittent headaches.  She denies any other urinary
symptoms, rashes, diarrhea, masses or lesions.  ROS otherwise
reviewed in 13 systems and negative.

RUQUS [**Hospital1 18**] [**3-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post cholecystectomy with common bile duct dilatation
to 13 mm, but no intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. No stones
are seem in the visualized portions of the common bile duct,
though the distal duct is not well evaluated. MRCP is a more
sensitive exam for the detection of choledocholithiasis and can
be performed for further evaluation.
2. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration of the
liver. More severe hepatic disease including significant hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this study

Lipase 6741

CT from LGH, dissection protocol:  No dissection, found to have
acute pancreatitis, without pseudocyst or abscess.  Small 5 mm
increased density in the region of the pancreatic head/distal
CBD could be an obstructing stone/choledocholithiasis.

ERCP REPORT:  A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
A single stone was extracted successfully using a balloon. Two
more balloon sweeps were performed that did not reveal
additional stones or sludge.

Impression: The ampulla appeared bulging concerning for an
impacted stone
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique
A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with
the CBD measuring 13 mm.
The cholangiogram did not definitively show a filling defect in
the distal CBD. However given the clinical picture  suggestive
of gallstone pancreatitis and the finding of bulging ampulla
concerning for an impacted stone, a decision was made to perform
a sphincterotomy.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
A single stone was extracted successfully using a balloon.
Two more balloon sweeps were performed that did not reveal
additional stones or sludge.
Otherwise normal ercp to second part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
66F with PMHx of hypertension, s/p CCY [**2089**], who was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] from LGH for acute gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP
w/sphincterotomy [**3-22**], hospital course complicated by new onset
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

# Afib w/RVR: After the ERCP, the patient developed new-onset
afib w/RVR. Etiology unclear, possibly related to
hypersympathetic tone in the context of acute pancreatitis. TSH
was normal. Cardiac enzymes were negative. Did not anticoagulate
her given CHADS2 score of 1 and bleeding risk from
sphincterotomy [**3-22**] during ERCP. A TTE was performed which
showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function, However there was mild left atrial dilatation which
may have been a cause or effect of the atrial fibrillation. The
patient spontanously converted back to sinus rhythm.  Given her
CHADS 2 score, use of both aspirin and plavix can be considered.
 She was started on aspirin alone, and advised to discuss with
her PCP any additional use of plavix.

# Hypoxemia: Most likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema in
the context of fluid resuscitation and new atrial fibrillation.
Resolved.

# Pancreatitis: Patient is s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy and
stone extraction. LFTs are trending down and she reports
improvement in her abdominal pain. Will continue symptom
management.  LFTs improved over course of hospitalization.

# Leukocytosis: Patient presented with normal WBC 6.4 on
admission, which rose to 16.8. Likely due to inflammation from
acute pancreatitis. S/p ERCP w/sphincterotomy; no evidence of
cholangitis on ERCP, but given low-grade fevers (99.5) and
increasing leukocytosis, started empiric cipro. No evidence of
pneumonia on CXR.  She will complete one week of ciprofloxacin
at home.

# Hypertension:  She was discharged on amlodipine and
metoprolol.  She will f/u with her PCP for continued blood
pressure management.

# ? NASH/hepatic fibrosis on ultrasound.  PCP should discuss
dietary measures, consider liver biopsy to further assess.
