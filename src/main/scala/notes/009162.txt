History of Present Illness:
History form medical personnel and PMH from family as pt mute

56 year-old man with a history of HTN, previous intracranial
hemorrhage presents from podiatrist's office with sudden onset
difficulty speaking and right-sided weakness.

Per report, pt went to podiatrist today for pain in foot, ?gout.
He was fine, able to fill out PMH questionairre. Was in exam
room speaking with podiatrist ~4:30 when he had sudden onset of
slurred speech. When EMS arrived, he had left gaze preference
and right-sided neglect, was mute, and had flaccid hemiparesis
of right side. He was following commands (move leg, squeeze
hand).  Vitals in field were BP 172/130, HR 80s, FSBS 89. He was
brought emergently to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

He arrived in ED ~5:15. Exam notable for mutism, following some
commands, sleepy. NIHSS 21. Emergent head CT showed left basal
gangla hemorrhage. Vitals with BP 210s/140s, so labetalol gtt
started. He became increasingly sleepy, and had pooling of blood
in mouth from laceration of unknown etiology and thus was
electively intubated for airway protection.


Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Hemorrhagic stroke, [**2181**], unknown location. Per wife, had an
unknown neurosurgery performed while hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 **].
3. ?Gout

Social History:
SH: Married, owns Chinese restaurant.

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status: Initially awake, looking around. Later, sleepier,
though arouable to loud voice and touch. Follows simple commands
(opens eyes, moves arm, squeezes hand, moves leg). Profound
neglect of right side to all modalities, though did once briefly
look to right.

Cranial Nerves: Unable to assess visual fields due to
inattention. Pupils equal and reactive 3-->2. Leftward eye
deviation, crossed midline briely only once. +Corneals
bilaterally. Right facial droop. Grimace to nasal tickle
bilaterally. +Gag.

Sensation: Withdraws to noxious x4, though minimal movement on
right.

Motor: Right side flaccid. No fasiculations. No tremor. Dense
right hemiparesis, had minimal biceps and hip addduction.

Reflexes: Decreased on right. Toes up on right, down on left.

Coordination: Unable to assess given mental status.

Upon discharge:

The patient was awake and following appendicular commands like
showing two fingers on the left hand.  He was not able to stick
out his tongue.  He still had partial neglect of his right side
thought it was improved compared to admission.  He minimally
withdrew his right side to noxious stimuli.  He had spontaneous
movement of both extremities on the left but none on the right.

CT head [**12-27**]:IMPRESSION: 2.5cm acute hematoma within the left
basal ganglia.
CT head [**12-30**]:IMPRESSION: Slight interval increase in edema
without change in size of left basal ganglia hemorrhage. Stable
minimal shift of the midline structures to the right.

TTE [**12-31**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. A secundum type atrial septal defect is
present. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
presence of a mass or vegetation on the tricuspid valve cannot
be excluded. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve
are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial
effusion.

CXR: [**1-1**]
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly and radiological findings of congestive
heart failure.

TEE [**1-9**]:
IMPRESSION: Large ASD (secundum type suggested, cannot exclude
primum) with significant left to right shunt. Severe prolapse of
the anterior mitral (A2) valve leaflet (no mitral cleft
identified) with moderate to severe eccentric mitral
regurgitation. No intracardiac thrombus.

ABD XR [**1-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 9835**]
gastrojejunostomy tube with the tip of the catheter in the
proximal jejunum; catheter can be used next morning if no
bleeding is seen through the NG tube.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 56 man with history of hypertension, old
hemorrhagic stroke 6 yrs ago with craniotomy at NWH, who
presented [**2187-12-27**]  with sudden onset of right hemiparesis and
aphasia. Initial exam was notable for dense right hemiparesis,
right neglect, mutism, though not global aphasia as he was able
to follow some simple commands. Head CT with left basal ganglia
hemorrhage. Given history of hypertension, location of bleed and
negative tox screen, likely hypertensive in etiology.

Pt was intubated and admitted to the ICU for observation
overnight in response to the pt's increased somnolence in the
ED, likely attributable to ativan given for agitation to
facilitate imaging. In the ICU, the Pt's neurological exam
remained stable and he became increasingly more alert to the
extent that he was successfully weaned from the ventilator,
enabling transfer to the stepdown unit of the neurology floor.
Upon transfer, the Pt had a repeat head CT that showed slight
interval increase in edema without change in size of the left
basal ganglia hemorrhage. A TTE was performed to assess the
likelihood of a cardiac embolic etiology. The TTE was
significant for a large ASD, likely secundum type, with left to
right shunt at rest, moderate mitral regurgitation, and no
thrombus or vegetation. A follow up TEE performed several days
later confirmed the presence of a 2-3cm ASD, moderate-severe MR,
and the absence of an intracardiac thrombus. The patient's
neurological exam remained stable with right side hemiplegia but
his mental status improved sufficiently to transfer him to a
standard neurolog
