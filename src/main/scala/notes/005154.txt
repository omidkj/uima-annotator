Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 79 year old man with congestive heart failure with
an ejection fraction of 20-25% in [**2194-12-26**], history of GI
bleeds secondary to arteriovenous malformations, mechanical
aortic heart valve on coumadin, chronic renal insufficiency
(baseline Cr 2.6), cirrhosis with ascites, and recent GI
bleeding from gastric angioectasia on Hospice Care who presents
with melena and the subjective sensation that his blood pressure
was low.  Patient originally saw his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] his vital signs
were stable in office.  He was not hypotensive and was referred
to the emergency room.  In the emergency room his hematocrit was
found to be 16.1.  He was hemodynamically stable (BP in 80's but
that is recent baseline).  Guiaic positive, melanotic stool.  An
NG lavage was negative.  One unit of blood started and patient
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring.
.
Of note, the patient was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 19159**] with
dyspnea thought to be due to CHF.  He was treated with a lasix
gtt (requiring a dopamine gtt to maintain renal perfusion) and
metalozone.  He was also treated for a UTI.  Given his poor
prognosis secondary to his worsening heart failure, palliative
care was consulted.  The patient was discharged home with
hospice on [**6-16**].  His code status is DNR/DNI.

Past Medical History:
1. Congestive heart failure, LVEF equals 20% to 25% ([**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2194**]).
2. Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
3. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
4. Status post mechanical aortic valve replacement done in [**2182**]

in [**Hospital1 46**].

7. Cirrhosis (right heart failure).
8. Ascites.
9. GI bleed (small bowel AVM)
10. MRSA bacteremia

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course/Assessment/Plan:
Patient is a 79 year old man with a past medical history
significant for congestive heart failure (end stage, recently
admitted to hospice), atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
cirrhosis, history of GI bleeding secondary to small bowel AVM
who was admitted for bright red blood per rectum and a
hematocrit of 16.1.
.
#GI bleeding:
Patient was noted to have guaiaic positive stool.  NG lavage was
negative.  He received two units of packed red blood cells and
hematocrit was serially measured.   Placed on PPI, but increased
frequency to twice daily.  Patient will need to remain on
coumadin for mechanical cardiac valve, but given multiple admits
for GI bleeds, decision made to decrease goal INR to 1.5--2.0
with understanding that this would put him at a higher stroke
risk.  This decision was made in conjunction with the patient's
cardiolgist.  Had extended family discussion with patient and
palliative care team on [**6-26**].  Decided to defer colonoscopy
during this visit.  If bleeding recurs, could consider further
procedure to help delineate cause of lower GI bleed.  Patient
instructed to have close follow up with PCP for measurement of
hematocrit and INR levels.  Increased frequency of pantoprazole
to twice daily.
.
#Congestive heart failure:
Patient with endstage failure (EF 20-25% in [**2194-12-26**]).  Not
candidate for ICD or pacer per cardiology evaluation.  Patient
received IV lasix following administration of blood products.
Restarted on Aldactone and Lasix on discharge.
.
#Chronic kidney disease:  During hospitalization, creatinine
remained at baseline.
.
#Cirrhosis:  Most likely result of right sided heart failure.
No active issues.
.
#Family meeting on [**2195-6-26**] decided that patient will return
home with hospice.
DNR/DNI.  Confirmed with patient via interpreter and family.
