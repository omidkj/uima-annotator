History of Present Illness:
67 year old male who presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3549**] Hospital with

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2136-1-6**]
PREBYPASS: There is severe LV dilation and global hypokinesis of
the left ventricle with a calculated LVEF <20% by simpsons
method of discs, and a fractional area change of <20%. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated, and there is a mild to
moderate decrease in RV systolic funciton. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed, but there is a valve
area by continuity equation of 1.8 cm2 and by planimetry of
1.75cm2 cosistent with mild stenosis. There is decreased
systolic function with a decreased stroke volume across the AV,
therefore the gradients were all very low. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Mild TR and PI are
present. The interatrial septum is intact. There is no evidence
of clot in the left atrial appendage, although the velocities
measrued are less than 40 cm/sec. There is mild to moderate
descending thoracic aortic atherosclerosis. There is no
pericardial effusion.

POSTBYPASS: S/P CABG. Essentially unchanged. Mild improvement of
systolic function with inotrope administration

[**2136-1-2**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.  Left ICA stenosis <40%.

Renal Ultrasound [**2136-1-3**]
1. Normal-sized kidneys with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Non-obstructive right upper pole stone versus stone in a
caliceal
diverticulum.
3. Bilateral cysts and a small AML in the upper pole of the left
kidney.


Brief Hospital Course:
 Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2135-12-30**] for further
management of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner which included a carotid duplex
ultrasound which showed less then a 40% stenosis of the
bilateral internal carotid arteries. A renal consult was
obtaibed given his baseline creatinine was elevated at 1.6. An
ultrasound was obtained which showed normal-sized kidneys with
no evidence of hydronephrosis. It was believed that his chronic
kidney disease was due to his diabetes. On [**2136-1-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**]
was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see operative
note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. He was transfused
for postoperative anemia.
He developed ATN with a  creatinine peak to 2.9- doown to 1.5 on
day of discharge.
Ace-I , betablocker and diuresis and statin therapies were
started and titrated to effect. Pacing wires and chest tubes
were removed per protocol. Mr. [**Known lastname 7086**] developed serosanguinous
drainage from the distal pole of his sternal incision. He was
started on IV cefazolin and changed to po keflex upon discharge
for 7 days.
He was cleared for discharge by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on POD#10 to rehab
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rehab in [**Location (un) 47**].
