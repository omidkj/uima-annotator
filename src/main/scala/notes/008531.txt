CXR, [**2139-10-29**]: Subcutaneous emphysema in the upper right

subphrenic collection. Lungs are clear. Heart is top normal
size. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy,
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection
for endomterial cancer on [**2139-10-29**].  Please see Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 90756**]
operative note for full details.

Post-operatively she was noted to have increased work of
breathing while and was hypoxic after extubation. An ABG was
attempted in the PACU and failed. She was placed on BiPap with
excellent oxygenation.  She came to the ICU where she was
conversant and comfortable with the mask on.  Within 30 minutes
she was transitioned from 4L to 2L NC to RA with excellent Sats
throughout.  ABG revealed intact oxygen exchange.  She was
observed overnight and called out to the floor on POD #1.
.
She was discharged from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on POD#1.  Once arriving on the
floor she was able to tolerate a regular diet, ambulate and
control her pain with oral pain medications.  She was able to
void and returned to her baseline incontinence once her foley
catheter was removed.  On POD2 she it was attempted to wean her
off of O2 unsuccessfully.  She would desaturate on room air to
89%. This was likely secondary to her COPD, for which she is not
on home oxygen.  She was not having any subjective shortness of
breath or chest pain and would improve with nebulizers. On POD3
she was successfully weaned off of oxygen to room air with O2
saturation >94%. She was discharged in good condition on POD3
with follow-up.
