CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This a 64-year-old Caucasian
female with a past medical history significant for ovarian
cancer of a papillary peritoneal serous type, metastatic,
status post TAH, BSO in [**8-/2104**] with recurrence of disease
[**8-/2105**], which was treated with subtotal colectomy and
ileostomy with mucous fistula.  Chronic PE, DVT, and most
recently SVC syndrome.  On [**4-/2105**], the patient was diagnosed
by increased shortness of breath.  The patient complained
today of approximately three weeks of increased shortness of

noted five days of increased low extremity edema, increased
facial swelling, and increased in pleuritic chest pain.  The
chest pain is left sided, now almost constant.  The patient
also complains of headaches, fatigue, and chills with some
increase in the amount of abdominal pain.  The p.o. intake is
poor.  She denied fevers, change in stool, or dysuria.  She
has chronic mild cough with scant sputum, which is unchanged.
In the ambulance, she received Morphine and Lasix for
presumed CHF without improvement in her symptoms.

count 519; MCV 82; RDW 14.7; PT 25.9; INR 4.4; PTT 55.2.
Differential WBC 69% neutrophils, 22% lymphs, 5% monocytes.
Chem 7 on admission showed the sodium of 141, potassium 3.5,
chloride 107, bicarbonate 25, BUN 44, creatinine 0.8, sugar
88, CK 29.

Chest x-ray showed residual left effusion.  Echocardiogram
from [**3-/2106**] showed EF of 35% to 45%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 under
the [**Hospital1 139**] Medicine Firm for further evaluation.  Coumadin
was held, pending possible IR intervention, and she was
started on Heparin GTT on a weight-based scale.  She
underwent CT of the chest on [**2106-10-11**], which showed
difficult evaluation SVC thrombus secondary to artifact from
the stent and catheter, which runs through the SVC.  However,
there were numerous collaterals seen within the chest wall
suggesting venous thrombosis, which could not be proven by CT
imaging.  There were also noted multiple mediastinal and
hilar lymph nodes, two small pleural effusions and two small
pulmonary nodules not clearly identified on the previous
examination.  The MR was not detected secondary to the stent,
which was in place in the SVC from previous SVC syndrome.
This was followed by SVC gram on [**2106-10-12**].  This was done
under general anesthesia, and the patient was intubated
despite her DNR/DNI status for the procedure.  The DNR/DNI
status had been revoked temporarily.  Occlusion of the
subclavian vein, brachiocephalic vein, and the
brachiocephalic stent was noted.  A #4 French infusion
catheter was placed from the left axillary vein to the
superior vena cava and TPA infusion was begun.  She was then
transferred to the MICU for TPA infusion and frequent blood
draws.  She remained intubated during that time.  She
remained in the MICU for two days on TPA, after which TPA was
stopped and the patient self extubated.  As stated above, on
[**10-15**] the TPA was stopped and Heparin was continued for PTT
of 60 to 80.  The patient was self extubated on [**2106-10-16**]
and returned to the floor under [**Hospital1 139**] Medicine Firm on
[**2106-10-17**].

Of note, during her MICU stay, the patient began to produce
thick-like sputum, suctioned off the endotracheal tube.  She
also had some lymphocytosis and possible aspiration pneumonia
was evaluated by chest x-ray.  However, chest x-ray remained
clear and she did not receive further antibiotics.

#1.  SVC syndrome.  As above, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was continued on
Heparin gtt. until [**2106-10-27**] at 2 a.m.  Heparin was stopped
at that point in preparation for a procedure, and then she
was started on Lovenox 70 mg p.o.b.i.d. and Coumadin 3 mg
p.o.q.h.s. for therapeutic INR.

#2.  FEN:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had continual TPN q.d.  There was a
brief period between [**10-17**] and [**10-18**] during which she
received TPN.  This was secondary to the use of the Hickman
Port-A-Cath for TPA and interventional radiology access.
Initially, it was thought that TPN could not longer go
through these ports, but per hyperalimentation fellow, TPN
was restarted.  The TPN at discharge was the following:  60
of amino acid, 280 of dextrose, with sodium acetate addition.
During her hospital course, Mrs.[**Location (un) 32259**] bicarbonate began
to drop from 19 down to 11.  At that time, sodium acetate was
instituted, as well as IV fluids with 3 ampules of
bicarbonate, and her serum bicarbonate level corrected.

#3.  Mental status.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was intubated in the MICU
and required Ativan for continued sedation.  However, in the
MICU, it was noted that she had prolonged effect from
benzodiazepines and the benzodiazepines were discontinued.
On the day of transfer of [**2106-10-17**], she received 20 mg p.o.
Serax and had altered mental status for the next 48 hours.
She was noted to be extremely lethargic, and thus underwent a
head CT to rule out subdural hematoma.  The CT was negative
for bleed or any other processes, and Ms. [**Known lastname **] mental
status eventually improved.  Of note, when Ms. [**Known lastname **]
continued to have increasing lethargy, ABG was attained,
which showed pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 38, pO2 86 on two liters of
oxygen.  Repeat ABG was undergone on [**2106-10-20**].  On
[**2106-10-21**], the pH was 7.24, pCO2 29, pO2 71, lactate, at
that time was 0.9.

#4.  Pulmonary.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted from emergency
department on two liter nasal cannula.  She underwent
intubation on [**2106-10-13**] during treatment of her SVC
syndrome, and she was extubated on [**2106-10-16**].  She was
gradually weaned off oxygen on the floor, and was tolerating
room air with saturation 94% to 97%.  However, on [**2106-10-25**],
she became acutely short of breath, and she was placed on
four liters of nasal cannula.  Chest x-ray showed stable
effusions and no further CHF changes.  She was given 20 mg IV
Lasix without good diuresis.  The EKG was stable without
sinus tachycardia or any other changes.  She continues to be
on four liters nasal cannula with saturation of 94% to 95%.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent thoracentesis on [**2106-10-27**] to
