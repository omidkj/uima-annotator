History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 63744**] is a 48 year old man with a history of end stage
renal disease (on HD), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and
substance abuse who presents from home with adominal pain.
He was in his usual state of health until 2 weeks ago when he
developed nausea, vomiting, and diffuse crampy abdominal pain.
He had difficulty taking POs without vomiting, grew
progressively fatigued, and did not go to his scheduled
dialysis. After a few days, he developed diarrhea and difficulty
breathing. As his symptoms worsened, he decided to come to the
emergency room on [**2158-6-21**].
.
He received dialysis at Frecenius dialysis [**Location (un) 6409**]
(Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday). Last dialysis was 2 weeks ago. He
states he felt unwell first and then was unable to go to
dialysis due to his illness.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 97.3, BP 149/103, P 80, R 19,
O2 sat 100% on RA. Labs revealed K 6.9, Cr 22.2. Patient was
given kayexylate 30 mg, calcium gluconate 10 mg, 1 amp sodium
bicarbonate, 10 units IV insulin and 1 amp D50 IV x 2. He had a
CT abdomen without contrast that was negative for acute process.
CXR did not show significant volume overload.
.
He was admitted initially to the ICU for monitoring overnight.
His potassium improved with medical management prior to HD. He
underwent dialysis the following morning (hospital day 1) and
was tranferred to the floor at night in stable condition. On
hospital day 2, he underwent dialysis again.
.
His abdominal pain, n/v have resolved and he is tolerating POs.
His diarrhea has resolved and he had a well-formed bowel
movement yesterday.
.

Past Medical History:
- ESRD: secondary to hypertension on HD x 10 years with LUE
fistula. Frecenius dialysis [**Location (un) 6409**] (Tuesday, Thursday,

previous alcohol, cocaine use has caused him to miss dialysis.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year old male with a history of end stage renal disease,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and substance abuse who
presents from home with fatigue, nausea, dyspnea and abdominal
pain after missing dialysis for two weeks.

1) Uremia/End Stage Renal Disease
It was suspected that the patient's symptoms were in large part
secondary to missing dialysis for two weeks. He may have
initially had a viral gastroenteritis (see below) that
preciptated these events; the patient says he intially felt ill
and as a result was unable to go to dialysis. Of primary concern
in the emergency room was his hyperkalemia with peaked T waves
on EKG. His potassium was initially 6.9. He was not
encephalopathic. He was treated with kayexylate and transferred
to the ICU for hemodialysis. He was transferred to the floor and
continued hemodialysis, for a total of 3 sessions over 3 days.
His potassium decreased to 4.8. His symptoms described below
resolved with dialysis. He was also treated with sevelamer and
calcium acetate. At discharge, he planned to attend his
regularly scheduled dialysis.

2) Chest Pain
The patient intially reported vague diffuse chest pain with mild
dyspnea. He was ruled out for MI by cardiac enzymes and there
were no ischemic changes on EKG.  There were no signs of
pericarditis on EKG. His chest pain resolved with hemodyalsis.


3) Abdominal Pain/Pancreatitis:
The patient reported abdominal pain and diarrhea with chills and
cough x 2 weeks. The patient had mild diffuse bilateral
mid-epigastric to lower abdominal pain without rebounding or
guarding. Patient was afebrile and without leukocytosis. Workup
in the emergency room was negative with the exception of mildly
elevated pancreatic enzymes.  He may have had viral
gastroenteritis exacerbated by and leading to missing dialysis.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed no acute findings. His abdominal pain
resolved with hemodialysis.

4) Diarrhea
Patient reports having diarrhea for the past 2 weeks and
vomiting (last emesis 3 days prior to admission).  No recent
hospitalization or antibiotics per his report.  It was suspected
that his bowel symptoms were related to uremia. Diarrhea
resolved with dialysis. Patient remained afebrile and without
leukocytosis.

5) Hypertension
The patient's blood pressures were mildly elevated during
admission.  He was continued on atenolol and norvasc. Lisinopril
was held for hyperkalemia and as held on discharge at least
until follow-up with his nephrologist.
