Pertinent Results:
[**2150-12-21**] 1:58 pm URINE      Source: CVS.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2150-12-22**]**

   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2150-12-22**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.

enlarged.
Mediastinum is within normal limits. There is increased
consolidation of the right lower lobe with a moderate
right-sided pleural effusion. There is a moderate left pleural
effusion with left lower lobe consolidation. There is patchy
airspace opacification of the right upper lobe. There is

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M with COPD on home O2, AFib on lovenox, DVT s/p IVC filter
admitted with hypoxemia and hypercapnia after being found to be
cyanotic, confused, and hypoxic.

#Hospital-acquired pneumonia- Started on an 8 day course of
vancomycin and cefepime ([**Date range (1) 46367**]). PICC line placed [**12-20**]/
Cultures remained negative.

#Acute on chronic diastolic CHF - Treated with bolus diuresis
(furosemide 20 mg IV) with decrease in admission weight. Unable
to accurately measure urine output as the patient refused a
foley catheter.  Patient will need to have electrolytes followed
closely on Friday, [**2150-12-25**].  Will continue to diurese and to
replete electrolytes as needed.

#Atrial fibrillation - Rate controlled with diltiazem and
digoxin. Treated with aspirin instead of systemic
anticoagulation given his history of falls.

#COPD- Continued with albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer.  He
was started advair.

#Nutrition- After discussion with patient and his sister,
patient wishes to continue with diet knowing about his
aspiration risk.  He did have an episode of witnessed
aspiration.  Patient should adhere to the recommendations of
speech/swallow therapy from [**12-14**] (1. PO diet of nectar thick
liquids and pureed solids, 2. Full supervision with all PO
intake, 3. Encourage single sips of liquid and slow rate of
intake, 4. Meds crushed with purees).

#Goals of care- Confirmed DNR/DNI status with the patient and
his sister and healthcare proxy, [**Name (NI) 1743**] [**Name (NI) 17839**].  If
patient cannot adhere to the recommended diet above, please
consider "do not rehospitalize" order if it is still consistent
with his goals of care.
