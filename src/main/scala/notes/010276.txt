RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2196-3-5**] 11:15 AM
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: eval interval change
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75yoM s/p OPCABGx2(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM)[**3-3**]
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval interval change
STUDY: AP chest, [**2196-3-5**].
HISTORY: 75-year-old man status post CABG. Evaluate for interval
change.
FINDINGS: The sheath in the right IJ has been removed. There are
markedly low lung volumes which limits evaluation. There is
crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings at the lung bases.
There is a left retrocardiac opacity. There are no signs for
overt pulmonary edema.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  *8.2 cm  <= 5.0 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  40% to 45%  >= 55%
Aorta - Sinus Level:  3.4 cm  <= 3.6 cm
Aorta - Ascending:  *3.7 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA. No
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF.
Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Moderately dilated RV cavity.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. The right atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with antero and anteroseptal
hypokinesis.. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV
diastolic dysfunction.
4. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis.
5. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results.
8. The procedure was done off-pump. Transient regional changes
with OM, LAD occlusion. On infusions of phenylephrine, epi.
9. The aortic contour is normal postCABG.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**3-2**] for
surgical evaluation for coronary bypass surgery. He was brought
to the operating room on [**3-3**] for coronary bypass grafting, see
OR report for details. In summary he had off pump CABG x2 with a
LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM. He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. He
was hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op period but
given his COPD he was ventilated throughout the operative day.
On the morning of POD1 he was weaned and extubated without
difficulty. On POD2 he was transferred to the step down floor
for continued post-operative care. Over the next several days
his activity level was advanced by nursing and PT and on POD #4
he was ready for discharge home.
