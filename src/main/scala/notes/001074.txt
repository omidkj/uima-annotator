Mr. [**Known lastname 24071**] is a 77y.o. man who presents from [**Hospital 24072**] with acute renal failure.  He was admitted there on
[**11-14**] after acute hospitalization for encephalopathy of unknown
origin, concern for NMS (though ruled out by neurology), and
failure to wean of mechanical ventilation.  He had originally
presented at that time with agitation, disorientation and
admitted to psych.  He received Haldol and developed "movements"
throughout his body.  Subsequent course is unknown at this time.
 His course over the last month at NE Specialty is also not
known.
However, over the last week he has developed renal failure.
According to lab results from rehab, his Cr was 2.7 on [**12-7**].3 on [**12-8**] on [**12-11**], and 3.3 today.  BUN has been
consistently over 100.  There is no notation of events,
treatments that occurred during this time.  At rehab today, he
was started on dopamine at 2, but this was stopped on his
arrival to ED here.  His BP at rehab today was also 80/48.
In the ED here, pt received treatment for his hyperkalemia with
CaGluc, Insulin, Bicarb, and kayexalate.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD: s/p IMI, s/p 3v CABG ('[**79**]), s/p cath in '[**92**] with LMCA
stent and POBA of LAD.
2. Cardiomyopathy, Ischemic:  TTE in [**2-9**] showed EF 40%, 2+ MR.
3. HTN
4. Hypercholesterolemia
5. PVD: extensive with occl right SFA, LCI, LCF.
6. COPD with bullous emphysema
7. Chronic respiratory failure:  recent vent settings were AC

MR C/T/L spine - IMPRESSION:
No abnormal enhancing lesions noted to suggest epidural abscess.

If symptoms persist, a followup MRI may be performed in one to
two weeks with a small field of view in the area of interest.
.
EMG -
IMPRESSION:

Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence for a
severe,
generalized, polyneuropathy which is predominantly axonal in
nature. In this clinical context, this finding is consistent
with a diagnosis of critical illness polyneuropathy. A
superimposed myopathic process, although difficult to exclude
with certainty, does not appear to be present.

.
EEG - Abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized and slowed
background with occasional bursts of generalized slowing. These
findings indicate a moderate encephalopathy affecting both
cortical and
subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and

infection are among the most common causes. There was no
prominent
focal abnormality although encephalopathies may obscure focal
findings.
There were no epileptiform features


Brief Hospital Course:
77 y.o. man with h/o extensive CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy,
PVD, ill-defined nervous system insult, now ventilator-dependent
presenting with acute renal failure that has been waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] 1 week prior to admission.  Renal service was consulted
who belived that the pt likely was intravascularly dry but total
body overloaded.  They recommended diuresing pt with lasix and
diuril, there was no improvement in renal function.  Pt
underwent hemodialysis X 3 days with no improvement in mental
status.  Neurology was also following who recommended several
studies including mri, emg, eeg.  All tests were inconclusive
and pt likely had critical care neuropathy.  His respiratory
status was not clear as to why pt was vent dependent.  After
several days in the hospital and not much improvement in
clinical status family meeting was done, where the family
decided to change the code status to comfort measures only.  He
was taken of the ventilator and expired few hours later.
