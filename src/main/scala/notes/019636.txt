noted to have generalized weakness and c/o abdominal pain at NH,
noted to have a low Hct and directed to come to the ED for

pain.  In the emergency department she had a CT Abd/Pelvis which
did not reveal any acute abdominal process, but there were b/l
effusions with possible PNA on the right.  She was started on a
dilt drip due to her persistent tachycardia.  She was guaiac
negative.  She was transfused a unit of PRBCs due to the
persistent tachycardia unresponsive to diltiazem.

.
CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Small right pleural effusion with adjacent right lower lobe
consolidation,
possibly reflecting compressive atelectasis though infectious
process cannot
be excluded.
2.  Congestive heart failure with evidence of volume overload
including
hepatic congestion, small amount of perihepatic ascites and
anasarca.
3.  Small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.
4.  Subtle areas of hypoenhancement within the right kidney,
which raise
concern for pyelonephritis.  Correlate clinically with UA.
5.  Top normal appendix measuring 6-7 cm; however, no
inflammatory change and
air present within the appendix.
.
TTE:
IMPRESSION: Preserved left ventricular regional and global
systolic function. Moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation with
right ventricular dilatation and moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGL   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 53146**]
Reason: explanation for elevated alk phos?



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   68 year old woman with elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   explanation for elevated alk phos?



Final Report
INDICATION:  Patient with elevated alkaline phosphatase.

FINDINGS:

The liver demonstrates normal echotexture without focal lesions.
 There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation.  The CBD is of normal caliber measuring 2 mm.
 The portal vein is patent demonstrating hepatopetal and
pulsatile flow.  Hepatic veins are prominent, which signify
underlying heart failure.  The gallbladder is incompletely
distended.  The gallbladder wall edema likely reflects
congestive heart failure.  A 3 mm polyp is seen in the
gallbladder wall.  The right kidney appears echogenic.

The pancreas is unremarkable, its tail obscured by overlying
bowel gas.  The spleen measures 8.2 cm and is normal in
appearance.  There is no ascites.  Imaged intra-abdominal aorta
and IVC are normal in caliber.  Small riht pleural effusion is
noted.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Normal liver echotexture without focal lesions.

2.  Gallbladder wall edema, prominent hepatic veins and
pulsatile portal
venous flow signify underlying congestive heart failure.

3.  Small right pleural effusion.

4.  Echogenic right kidney, may represent chronic parenchymal
disease,
correlate clinically.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
====================================
68 y/o female with history of A fib w/ difficult to control
rates, hypertension, DMII, anemia, and schizophrenia presenting
from nursing home in afib RVR and with anemia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
================
# Atrial fibrillation w/ RVR: Rates were initially in the 170s
on arrival to the ER. Patient was given IV diltiazem and IV
metoprolol in the ER with little effect and was eventually
started on a diltiazem infusion at 15 mg/hr in the ICU. She
continued to have rates in the 140s and blood pressures in the
80s to 90s. Cardiology recommended Digoxin loading. She was
briefly on an Esmolol infusion as well to help control rates and
was able to be weaned from this with oral Diltiazem and
Metoprolol. According to her last Cardiology note, the patient
was to be on diltiazem as an outpt but nursing home records did
not show this medication - she was solely on metoprolol. This
may have been the provoking reason for the rapid ventricu
