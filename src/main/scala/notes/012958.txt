Service:  C-MEDICINE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with
a history of two prior myocardial infarctions, most recent in
[**Month (only) 958**], history of congestive heart failure, ejection fraction
less than 30%, who now presents with two to three weeks of
worsening shortness of breath, lower extremity edema and
increasing abdominal girth.  These symptoms developed
gradually.  He also noticed worsening orthopnea with regular
episodes of having to sleep in a reclining chair.  He also
reports paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  The lower extremity
edema he says is completely new to him and is progressively
getting worse.  He also reports increase in his abdominal
girth.  Additional complaints include weakness, fatigue, and
productive cough which is, however, somewhat chronic.  Of
note, when the patient presented with myocardial infarction
in the past, his only complaint was shortness of breath.
However, the shortness of breath in the previous myocardial
infarctions was much more severe than now.  He denies chest
pain, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for fever, chills, dysuria or
change in appetite.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, catheterization in [**2104-6-9**],
showed severe three vessel disease with severely elevated
right and left sided filling pressures, mild aortic stenosis.
Echocardiogram also revealed an ejection fraction of less
than 30%.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  He was never on
steroids, never intubated.  FEV unknown.
3.  Diabetes mellitus type 2, medically controlled with oral
hypoglycemic, diagnosed about twenty years ago with no
complications.
4.  Status post hernia repair.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Hospital1 3494**] with his
wife and daughter.  Italian speaking only.  He used to work
as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].  He has a remote history of tobacco use in the
past.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Lasix 120 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Toprol XL 25 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Altace 2.5 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Terbutaline 5 mg p.o. twice a day.
8.  Glucotrol XL 10 mg p.o. once daily.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 96.9, blood pressure
80/60, heart rate 86, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation
99% in room air.  In general, the patient is sitting in bed
uncomfortable but in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular
movements are intact.  Anicteric sclerae.  The oropharynx is
clear.  The neck is supple with jugular venous distention
around seven centimeters.  Respiratory - Bibasilar crackles
left worse than the right.  Cardiovascular - normal S1 and S2
with a II/VI holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex
radiating into the axilla.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, with positive bowel sounds, no liver edge, no
shifting dullness, and no tenderness.  Extremities - 3+
pitting edema up to the knees, unable to appreciate pulses.
Neurologically, the patient is nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:   White blood cell count 7.3, hematocrit
32.1, platelet count 157,000.  Sodium 137, potassium 5.1,
chloride 98, bicarbonate 29, blood urea nitrogen 72,
creatinine 2.1, glucose 163.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - This congestive heart failure
exacerbation appears to have been acutely worse than previous
episodes.  This is the first time he has significant lower
extremity edema.  It was unlikely that infection or ischemia
was contributing to his congestive heart failure.  It was
therefore that potentially bowel wall edema was decreasing
the absorption of his p.o. diuretic.  He was therefore
started on intravenous Lasix to which he diuresed very well
and lost about four kilograms in his body weight in the first
two hospital days.  He was eventually started also on
Aldactone and continued to diurese relatively well.  He had
no complaints during his hospital stay.

On [**2104-7-11**], the patient had gone inside the bathroom and
locked the door.  His wife noticed that he has not responded
in about five minutes and alerted staff.  In about five
minutes, the bathroom was opened and the patient was found
pulseless with no breathing and no pulse.  Code was called
and he was found to be in PEA.  He was emergently transferred
to the catheterization laboratory where emergent cardiac
catheterization revealed severe three vessel disease with no
evidence of acute thrombus.  He was transferred to the CCU
where he remained unresponsive and developed severe
hypotension requiring the use of four pressors.

On the following day [**2104-7-12**], after discussion with family
members, it was decided to stop the pressors.  After
discontinuation of the pressors at 9:55 a.m. on [**2104-7-12**], the
patient expired at 10:00 a.m. on [**2104-7-12**].
