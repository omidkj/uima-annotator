IMAGING
==================
ABD SERIES [**5-23**]
FINDINGS: Supine and upright views of the abdomen were obtained.
There is
gaseous distention of small bowel without definite signs of
obstruction. No definite evidence for free air below the right
hemidiaphragm on upright view.  Elevated left hemidiaphragm with
left effusion is noted. The imaged portion of the lungs are
otherwise clear. Scoliosis and degenerative disease in the
thoracolumbar spine noted.

IMPRESSION: Gaseous distention of bowel without definite signs
of obstruction or free air. Left pleural effusion noted.
CT ABDOMEN [**5-24**]
FINDINGS: Bilateral tiny pleural effusions are noted with
adjacent bibasilar opacification, left greater than right which
likely represents pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.

The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable.
Atherosclerotic
calcifications are noted within the coronary vessels.

Evaluation of solid organs and intra-abdominal vasculature is
limited by non- contrast technique. Within this limitation, the
liver, spleen, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands are
unremarkable. Both kidneys appear within normal limits.
Diffusely dilated loops of small bowel are noted. The terminal
ileum shows thickened bowel wall which may represent
inflammation or infectious etiology; ischemia cannot be
completely excluded.

Large amount of stool is noted within diffusely within the large
bowel. There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
Retroperitoneal and
mesenteric lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for
pathologic
enlargement.

Visualized osseous structures show no focal lytic or sclerotic
lesion
suspicious for malignancy. Multilevel degenerative changes are
noted
throughout the cervical spine. A compression fracture of L1
vertebral body is noted of indeterminate chronicity. Additional
loss of vertebral body height is noted at the L3 vertebral body
again of indeterminate chronicity.
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffusely dilated loops of small bowel with transition point
in the mid
abdomen (2;56) close to the terminal ileum. Findings concerning
for partial versus early complete small bowel obstruction.
2. Large amount of feces diffusely throughout the colon which is
distended
with stool and air.
3. Small focal loop of distal small bowel with thickened bowel
wall most
likely represents peristalsis.
4. A compression fracture of L1 vertebral body is noted of
indeterminate
chronicity. Additional loss of vertebral body height is noted at
the L3
vertebral body again of indeterminate chronicity.
[**2198-5-28**]- CXR-
PORTABLE SUPINE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A nasogastric tube courses
below the
diaphragm and is incompletely imaged, but is at least within the
stomach.
Evaluation of the left lung apex is obscured due to patient
positioning and overlying support devices. Bibasilar opacities
persist and may represent atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia.
There are probable stable moderate pleural effusions. The right
upper lung zone appears clear. There is no visualized
pneumothorax. Mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
limits and are unchanged. Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette
is limited due to overlying opacities and pleural fluid. Severe
scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine is stable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Standard position of the nasogastric catheter.
2. Unchanged bibasilar opacities and probable moderate bilateral
pleural
effusions.
[**2198-5-30**] KUB-
IMPRESSION: Similar abdominal radiograph with loops of
gas-distended colon and small bowel, but interval progression of
oral contrast to the rectum since the CT abdomen and pelvis six
days ago. The progression of oral contrast and the persistence
of air in the colon are compatible with resolving bowel
obstruction/ileus.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Patient expired on [**2198-6-2**] from hypoxic respiratory failure
secondary to multifactorial etiologies including aspiration,
HAP, mucus plugging, chronic COPD and atelectasis.  Patient
coughed and began to have increased work of breathing and the
team was called for evaluation.  The patient initially had
rapid, shallowing breath, followed by agonal breathing.
Additional supplemental O2 were given.  Patient was DNR/DNI and
goals of care were reviewed with patient's daughter and family
at bedside.  As consistent with their wishes, no invasive
interventions were performed and patient was not transferred to
the ICU.  The patient subsequently expired.

# Hypoxic respiratory distress/HAP: Patient developed multiple
episodes of
