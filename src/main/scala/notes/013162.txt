Chief Complaint:
Asthma Exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 40 year old female with a past medical history
significant only for asthma controlled with occasional prn
albuterol. The patient had been having worsening asthma symptoms
since having a cold approximately 1 month ago. Patient presented
to the ED of the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] hospital in early [**Month (only) **]
and was given po 40mg prednisone for 4 days. The patient
improved considerably but then did not take any further meds
over the holidays. Subsequently, the patient presented to the
urgent care clinic at Mt Aubrun on [**1-22**] and was started on
prednisone and azithromycin. Patient completed the course but on
the day before admission, woke up at 5 in the morning with
increasing dyspnea and shallow breathing. EMS was called due to
increasing shortness of breath for 10-12 hours without
improvement on albuterol.

At the time of EMS arrival, the patient was tachycardic with O2
saturations in the low 70s, and was disoriented and combative.
EMS successfully intubated the patient on the second attempt
after she vomited after the first direct laryngoscopy. She was
given combivent nebs by EMS.

The patient was transported to the [**Hospital 4199**] hospital ED, where
she was given 125mg of methylprednisolone, 1gm of magnesium
sulfate, and was paralyzed with rocuronium and sedated with
midazolam/propofol. She was subsequently transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: bp 108/75, p133, r20, SO2 of 100% on
100% Fio2, PEEP 8, TV 600. The patient's ETT was adjusted after
it was found to be low on CXR, and blood cultures were drawn.
The patient received additional sedation with propofol and
fentanyl and was transfered to the MICU.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient's initial VS were: T 96.3,
HR 133, BP 117/69, Sp 99%. Her vent settings were CMV with PIP
17 / PEEP 5, Vt 450 with rr 22, I:E 1:3.5. She was extubated on
[**2186-1-30**] after getting IV abx and IV steroids. At the time of
transfer to the floor, pt was breathing comforatbly on RA,
satting in the mid-90s.

IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2186-1-30**] - ECHO - There is probably mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mid ventricular hypokinesis suggested.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomyopathy (?Takotsubo variant? Myocarditis?).
If indicated. Consider echo contrast study (or cardiac MRI) for
better clarification of regional wall motion abnormalities.
[**2186-1-31**] - CTA - The study is limited due to respiratory motion
and contrast bolus timing. However, there is no evidence of a
central pulmonary embolism. If clinical suspicion for segmental
or subsegmental pulmonary emboli is high, a repeat CTA study or
VQ scan may be considered.
[**2186-1-31**] - CXR -  The lung volumes are normal. Normal size of the
cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax, mild atelectasis at the
right lung base, no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.

MICRO:
- Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2186-1-31**]):
      Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
      Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3,
Influenza A, B,
      and RSV by immunofluorescence.
      Refer to respiratory viral culture for further
information.

- Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2186-1-30**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.




Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: 40 year old female who presented with asthma
exacerbation requiring intubation for 1 day, doing well on RA
post-intubation. Discharged on PO steroid taper and after a 5
day course of levofloxacin.

# ?Asthma Exacerbation: Pt currently doing well on RA after
having been intubated in the field. She remained intubated for 1
day, but was now doing well off the vent and transferred out of
the ICU to the medicine floor. Patient had leukocytosis w/o
bandemia, likely [**2-23**] steroids. Etiology of respiraotry distress
still remains murky, though asthma seems to be most likely
explanation
- We continued PredniSONE 40 mg PO/NG DAILY (day 2 of PO
steroids) and d/ced her on a 9 day taper
- We contine Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs while the patient was
in-house and d/ced her with albuterol and fluticasone inhalers

# Pneumonia: Pt had leukocytosis from infection vs steroids.
Urinary legionella and respiratory viral antigen were negative.
GPCs grew on sputum gram stain, in chains. Most likely could be
strep pneumo/contaminant. Sputum culture grew out commensual
respiratory flora.
- We continue Levofloxacin 750 mg PO/NG DAILY for a full 5 day
course

# Cardiomyopathy: patient had a TTE done which demonstrated mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid
ventricular hypokinesis possibly suggestive of cardiomyopathy.
EKG showed non-specific EKG changes suggestive of a
cardiomyopathy. DDx includes Takotsubo Variant vs Viral
Myocarditis. EKG unremarkable.
- Patient was set up for an outpt cardiology followup. Requires
TTE prior to visit.
