Allergies:
Shellfish

Attending:[**Known firstname 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Substernal chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization on [**2122-1-24**]:
EF 45%
Cypher stent to mid LAD

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 year old male with a history of CAD s/p 2
prior MIs but no CABG or stents, history of 35-40 years of
tobacco with COPD, HTN and HL who presented to [**Hospital3 **]
via ambulance on [**2122-1-24**] after experiencing [**10-31**] substernal
chest pain. The patient had been getting ready for bed when he
experienced nausea and vomiting x  diaphoresis and shortness of
breath. He then experienced [**10-31**] substernal chest pain that was
similar to his prior angina but much more severe. The pain
radiated down his left arm. He took 2 SL nitros at home without
relief and his wife called 911 and thus taken by ambulance to
[**Hospital3 **]. In the ambulance, he was in atrial fibrillation
and then suffered a vfib arrest and was shocked three times and
went into torsades. The patient was then loaded with 150 mg IV
amio and started on an amio gtt. At [**Hospital1 46**], he was found to have
2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations V2-V6. He was placed on Aggrastat, Plavix,
Lopressor, Amio gtt at 1 mg, nitro gtt and morphine and Mg 2 mg.
^The nitro was increased to 70 mcg/hr and the patient states he
became pain free. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.

Cardiac Cath [**2122-1-24**]:
EF 45%, no MR, anterolateral, apical and inferoapical akinesis
CO 4.6, CI 2.89
LVEDP 33, RA 13, PCW 22, PA 42/21

Left-dominant system
Normal LMCA, 95% distal LAD, 70% OM2, small and non-dominant RCA

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2122-1-28**]  7:22:58 AM


Sinus rhythm with PACs
Extensive T wave changes suggest myocardial infarct
Since previous tracing of [**2122-1-27**], QT interval decreased

ECHO Study Date of [**2122-1-27**]

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% (nl >=55%)
 Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed with akinesis of the
distal septum
and apex and severe hypokinesis of the inferior and
infero-lateral walls. The
basal anterior, antero-septal and lateral walls move best. Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD.

C.CATH Study Date of [**2122-1-24**]

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a left dominant
system with
two vessel CAD. The LMCA had no angiographic evidence of
coronary artery
disease. The LAD had a discrete distal 95% stenosis, which was
stented
(see below).  The LCX was large and dominant.  It gave off a
large OM1
branch and a large OM 2 branch. The OM2 branch had a 70%
stenosis
proximally. The RCA was small and non-dominant. It did not have
any
angiographically apparent CAD.
2. Hemodynamics performed after the intervention revealed
elevated left
and right heart pressures and a preserved cardiac index.
3. Left ventriculography revealed anterolateral, apical and
inferoapical
akinesis.  There was no mitral regurgitation. Calculated EF was
44%.
4. Successful direct stenting of the mid-LAD with a 3.0 x 18 mm
Cypher
DES. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
apparent
dissection, and TIMI 3 flow (see PTCA comments).
5. Successful closure of the right common femoral arteriotomy
with a 6
French Angioseal device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Acute myocardial infarction treated by primary PCI with
placement of
a drug-eluting stent in the mid-LAD.
4. Successful Angioseal.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 73 year old male with a history of CAD s/p 2
prior MIs with HTN and COPD who presented with an anterior STEMI
c/b vfib arrest

1. CAD
- The patient had suffered a large anterior STEMI complicated by
V. fib arrest in the ambulance ride to the hospital. He had a
Cypher stent placed to his mid-LAD and suffered no more chest
pain.
-The patient was originally started on ASA, aggrastat, Plavix
and a statin. He was also placed on heparin due to akinesis of
the apex. However, the patient developed a subsequent voluminous
GI bleed and required 2 units of blood. He had reported bright
red blood per rectum as an outpatient given his history of
rectal carcinoma. As a result, the aggrastat and heparin were
discontinued. Although the patient would benefit from coumadin
due to his akinetic apex, it was decided not to initiate
long-term anticoagulation as he did not tolerate this well. He
should have a repeat echo in 4 weeks to reassess his wall motion
and EF.
- He was placed on metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Lisinopril 5 mg.

2. CHF EF 45%
- The patient remained euvolemic during his stay.
- He had a repeat echo on [**2122-1-27**] which showed persistent
akinesis of the distal septum and apex with an EF of 30%.
- He was started on an ACE for cardiac remodeling.

3. HTN
- The patient takes Norvasc 5 mg and Imdur 30 mg at home. We
started Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Lisinopril 5 mg. His systolic
blood pressure on presentation was in the 120s but remained in
the 100s during the rest of his stay. He denied feeling dizzy or
lightheaded and did well with PT.

4. COPD
- The patient has a history of spontaneous pneumothoraces
secondary to bullous lung disease. We continued the patient's
outpatient inh
