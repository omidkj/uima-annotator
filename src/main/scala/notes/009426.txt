Echo [**1-8**]:  1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated.

aortic
regurgitation is seen.

Neurologically, on pre-injury dementia medications, aricept and
namenda.  was also on an experimental drug pre-injury which was
not continued.  on paxil.  has minimal narcotic requirements.

Ortho spine wants C-collar in place for a total of 6 weeks from
the time of fixation.

Cardiovascularly:  hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm on
metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **].  had rapid, unstable atrial fibrilaation
[**1-13**] which responded to electronic cardioversion.

Respiratory:  oxygenating, ventilating well on trach collar.
Continues to require frequent suctioning.  Cultures from [**1-16**]

coverage with cipro and a third generation cephalosporin
enterically.  CXR shows no definite infiltrate.
