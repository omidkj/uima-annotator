Abdominal X-ray ([**4-7**]): Linear lucency above the right
hemi-diaphragm noted on upright view suggesting free air.
Multiple dilated loops of large and small bowel with the small
bowel loops measuring up to 4 cm and multiple air- fluid levels.
Large amount of stool is noted in the rectosigmoid region.
Cannot exclude distal mechanical obstruction or early small
bowel obstruction. Unchanged bullet projecting over the mid
abdomen. There is no pneumatosis. Surgical clips are noted in
the right upper quadrant. IMPRESSION: Questionable Free air,
suggest immediate CT or upright chest radiograph. Multiple
dilated loops of bowel, distal or early small bowel obstruction
cannot be excluded. Findings were discussed with Dr[**Doctor Last Name **].
Addendum: Please note, the image was flipped during initial
review and upon re-review, the lucency in question is most
compatible with gas within the stomach (below the left
hemidiaphragm).
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: 1. Multiple focal ground glass and early
consolidative peribronchovascular opacities at both bases,
suggestive of aspiration or infectious bronchopneumonia. 2.
Evidence of mild fluid overload with small effusions and
interlobular septal thickening at the lung bases. 3. No source
of fever identified in the abdomen or pelvis, including no
evidence for abscess, bowel ischemia, or small-bowel
obstruction.
.
ECHO ([**4-11**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2108-12-10**], the severity of aortic valve stenosis has progressed
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt presented with abdominal pain consistent with prior episodes
of small bowel obstruction. He was passin flatus at the time of
admission therefore he was admitted to the surgical service and
managed conservatively with NGT/IVF/IV meds/Foley. Serial exams
were done. Symptoms resolved with conservative management and at
time of discharge he was tolerating full PO's with daily bowel
movements.
.
Psych was consulted regarding his Schizophrenia/Depression, he
was started on IM zyprexa while NPO. His clozaril was held while
he was NPO and he had some mild decompensation in his
psychiatric status with an episode of hallucinations and
disorientation. Clozaril was restarted at home dose however he
was noted to be somnolent several hours after receiving this
medication. He was restarted on low dose of clozaril with
gradual uptitration to previous home dose.
.
On hospital day #3, the patient spiked a fever 102.2 with
desaturation to 88% on room air and tachycardia to 110. Cardiac
enzymes were sent, CXR done, and CT of torso was performed. A
urine culture indicated a UTI and CXR/CT with evidence of PNA,
the patient was started on vanco/zosyn for presumed
hospital-acquired pneumonia. Infectious disease was consulted
and recommended continuing antibiotics to complete a 14 day
course.
.
Cardiac enzymes were positive with a peak CK-MB of 12.
Cardiology was consulted who felt that patient was in acute
decompensated heart failure likely related to the IV fluids he
had received during admission. Cardiac enzymes were felt to
represent a small non-Q wave MI related to demand from heart
failure therefore this was medically managed. An Echocardiogram
was performed that showed preserved systolic function but
worsened aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.8 as compared to
1.2 two years prior. He was transferred to the CCU team for
further diuresis. He tolerated diuresis well with improvement in
his oxygenation and was called out to the floor after 24 hours
in CCU.  The patient's hypoxia resolved with continued diuresis
and he was discharged with instructions to follow his weight
carefully and contact his cardiologist with changes in his
weight greater than 3lbs.
