Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
aspiration, small bowel obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
80M w/ COPD, CAD, HTN, with a complicated recent past
medical history, who originally presented after a fall on
[**2132-9-17**] in which he suffered a splenic laceration which was
treated with coil emobolization. He then developed a splenic
abscess that required splenectomy. The post op course was
further complicated by an enteric fistula and another abscess in

the splenic bed which was drained by IR. He then developed
respiratory failure and had a tracheostomy placed. He was also
treated for c.diff during this time as well. On [**1-9**], he
returned to [**Hospital1 18**] for cholecystitis and had a perc
cholecystostomy tube placed. Recently admitted for an aspiration
event.  He now returns from rehab again because of likely
aspiration.  Patient states he vomited what was likely tube
feeds
last night a few times.  This morning he had worsening shortness
of breath and was found to be tachycardic.  NG tube placed at
his
rehab put out a large amount of stomach contents.  Denies
fevers/chills, +BM, +flatus

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2133-2-9**]: 1. New diffuse mesenteric stranding
and intraperitonael free fluid and free air concerning for bowel
perforation. Air pockets are close to the track of the
cholecystotomy cathter and may be related but are new from CT 3
days ago. No evidence of recurrent obstruction. Probable segment
of small bowel wall thickening in the left lower quadrant. Bowel
wall ischemia cannot be excluded on this non-contrast-enhanced
CT. 2. Unchanged appearance of the lung bases with moderate
possibly loculated effusion on the right and small-to-moderate
effusion on the left. Extensive airspace opacification may
represent aspiration or pneumonia. No significant change in the
air-fluid containing lesion in the right lung base. 3. Bilateral
renal hypo- and hyper-dense lesions, incompletely characterized
but unchanged from the prior exam. 4. No significant change in
the transhepatic cholecystostomy tube and hypodense lesion in
segment IVb of the liver. 5. Unchanged infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm and right common iliac artery aneurysm.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**2133-2-6**]: 1. New air and fluid-containing lesion at
the right lung base concerning for abscess. Extensive airspace
opacity at the lung bases may reflect aspiration or residual
pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions slightly increased on the
right. 2. Persistent dilated small bowel with transition point
in the lower pelvis likely secondary to adhesions. Overall,
slightly improved from prior study. 3. Bilateral renal hypo and
hyperdense lesions incompletely characterized,
but grossly stable from prior exam. 4. Transhepatic
cholecystostomy tube appears in good position. 5. Diverticulosis
without evidence of diverticulitis. 6. Stable infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm and aneurysm of the right common iliac
artery

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical ICU. He was started on
an amiodarone drip for his AFib. An NGT was inserted and placed
to continuous low wall suction.
CT imaging revealed a new R lung base abscess. Interventional
pulmonology was consulted regarding possible aspiration via
bronchoscopy but they declined given the patient's already
depressed pulmonary function. Given the patient's prior history
of cdiff, VRE and pseudomonas, the infectious disease team was
consulted regarding antibiotic regimen. Per their
recommendations, the patient was started on linezolid and
tigecycline.

On the evening of [**2133-2-8**], the patient began to complain of
severe low abdominal pain. The next day, he became tachycardic
and hypotensive. An urgent repeat CT of the abdomen/pelvis was
obtain which showed free fluid and air within the abdomen
consistent with bowel perforation.

After a family meeting with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] on the
evening of [**2133-2-9**], it was decided to make the patient CMO but
continue antibiotics and fluids. The patient expired at 2:30am
on [**2133-2-11**].
