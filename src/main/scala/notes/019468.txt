HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year old female
patient who has previously undergone thoracic aortic aneurysm
repairs, times two, first time in [**2115**] and the second one in
[**2121**].  Second surgical intervention required a prolonged
hospitalization, complicated by a gangrenous gallbladder.
The patient was noted to have recurrent thoracoabdominal
aortic aneurysm, noted by a CAT scan obtained by the
patient's primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was reluctant to
undergo another surgical procedure but was ultimately
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] for surgical repair of the aneurysm.
The patient underwent an aortogram as well as cardiac
catheterization in preparation for the surgery. The aortogram
revealed a tortuous thoracic aortic aneurysm as well as
involvement in the abdominal aorta.  The patient was admitted
to the hospital on [**6-1**] to undergo a third time redo
thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension times 30 years.
Hypercholesterolemia treated with diet.  Gastroesophageal
reflux disease.  Osteoporosis.  Thoracoabdominal aneurysm
times two.  Strep B vaginitis, treated with Penicillin.
Depression.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post thoracic aneurysm repair
in [**2115**] and [**2121**]. Status post cholecystectomy in [**2121**],
secondary to gangrenous gallbladder postoperatively.  Status
post hysterectomy. Status post shoulder surgery.

MEDICATIONS:  Actonel 5 mg q. a.m.  Menest 0.625 mg p.o. q.
a.m.  Protonic 40 mg p.o. q. a.m.  Desipramine 50 mg p.o. q.
a.m. and q. noon time, 75 mg q h.s. Propanolol 40 mg q. a.m.,
q. noontime, q h.s.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q. [**Initials (NamePattern5) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern5) 32852**] 160 mg p.o. q h.s. Pen VK 500 mg q h.s. for her
previously stated vaginitis.  Calcium with Vitamin D, 600 mg
three times a day. Multi-vitamins q. day.  Senokot two
tablets twice a day.  Percocet two tablets every three hours
prn. Ativan prn.

The patient is a former smoker but quit 16 years ago. No
alcohol intake.  The patient's physical examination on
admission to the hospital was unremarkable.  The laboratory
values upon admission to the hospital were also unremarkable.
Chest x-ray showed severe aortic dilation and tortuosity with
no acute pulmonary disease.

The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**6-1**] with
anticipation of going to the operating room.  However, he was
noted to have a fever of 101.2.  An infectious disease
consult was obtained.  Empiric antibiotic therapy was
initiated. The patient was fully cultured and the fevers
ultimately resolved over the next few days without any
identified organism.  The patient was taken to the operating
room on [**2132-6-5**] where she underwent a thoracoabdominal
aneurysm repair with a gel-weave graft by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] and
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].  Postoperatively, the patient was transported
from the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit
on Neo-Synephrine, Dopamine and Propofol drip.  She also had
a spinal catheter in place at that time.

Over the first few days postoperatively, the patient was
ultimately weaned off her neo-synephrine drip.  She was
prophylactically placed on Vancomycin for antibiotic
coverage.  She was placed on Dopamine drip.  She remained on
full ventilator support.  On postoperative day number two,
the patient spiked a fever to 102.6.  She was pan cultured.
Ultimately, a sputum specimen grew out gram negative rods.
She had been started on Vancomycin as previously stated and
was placed on Zosyn at the time the gram negative rods were
discovered.  On postoperative day number three, due to
copious secretions and gram negative rods, she had a
bronchoscopy done at the bedside which revealed significant
tracheobronchitis and increased secretions.

On postoperative day number four, the patient had some rapid
atrial fibrillation which was treated with intravenous
Amiodarone.  The patient remained sedated on the ventilator
and was noted to be severely agitated everytime any sedation
was weaned.  On postoperative day number five, the patient
remained having rapid atrial fibrillation.  She had been
weaned off of neo-synephrine at that time.  She was
ultimately cardioverted from atrial fibrillation to sinus
rhythm with 200 joules.

On postoperative day number six, the patient was weaned from
the ventilator and extubated. However, she was reintubated a
short time later on the same day due to increased respiratory
rate and decreased oxygen saturation.  The following day, the
patient received a left pleural chest tube for pleural
effusion.  She was begun on tube feeds.  She had a repeat
bronchoscopy which showed decreased secretions.  She
underwent echo due to some worsening hypotension, which
revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of
approximately 20% which was significantly decreased from her
previous value of approximately 60.

She went to cardiac catheterization due to her new
echocardiogram findings and this revealed only mild coronary
artery disease.  It showed also left renal artery stenosis
with non flow limiting retrograde dissection of the right
common iliac artery as well as 80% left common iliac artery
stenosis.

The patient had been started on inotropic support due to her
decreased hemodynamic status as well as her decreased left
ventricular ejection fraction.  She was maintained on
inotropes and pressors over the next few days.  She underwent
another bronchoscopy on postoperative day number nine, [**6-13**], which revealed mild secretions.  Over the next few days,
the patient tolerated slow pressor support wean.  On [**6-15**],
she was again noted to be febrile with increased agitation.
She underwent another bronchoscopy which showed minimal
secretions and no further evidence of tracheobronchitis.

The sedation, Versed specifically was weaned. The following
day, she was being maintained on tube feeds at a goal rate.
She was on some Haldol for agitation. She underwent CT scan
of her abdomen, due to continued fever, which revealed
hematoma at her graft site.  She was placed also on
intravenous Fluconazole prophylactically because she was
developing a thrush in her mouth and also continued with
significant endotracheal tube secretions. The patient was
also noted to have profuse diarrhea that day and Clostridium
difficile studies were sent, which ultimately returned as
negative.

Again, on [**6-18**], the patient was extubated. She remained
agitated but appeared to be stable from a respiratory
standpoint.  On [**6-19**], the patient was noted to have an
asystolic episode which spontaneously reverted to
bradycardia, which quickly resolved to a normal sinus rhythm.
No intervention was required at that time. It was a
self-limiting event.  The following day, a repeat
echocardiogram showed significant improvement in the left
ventricular function, compared with her previous
echocardiogram.  It also revealed no apical thrombus.  The
patient, however, failed swallow evaluation at that time.  It
was the recommendation of the speech and swallowing service
to maintain npo status and begin tube feeds.  Later in the
day, the patient was again reintubated due to continued
respiratory distress.

A bronchoscopy was performed upon reintubation which revealed
minimal secretions.  The [**6-22**], Ciprofloxacin was
added to the patient's antibiotic regimen, due to pseudomonas
now obtained from her sputum, in order to double cover, as
she was continued with increased secretions.

On [**6-24**], postoperative day number 20, it was noted that
the patient had a positive heparin induced thrombocytopenia
screen. Therefore, her heparin was discontinued.  This was
felt to be safe to no longer anticoagulate the patient since
she had been six days at that point with no cardiac
arrhythmias, no further blocking down, no further atrial
fibrillation, negative deep vein thromboses were also
documented on the 15th.  She had an upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis due to left arm swelling but both upper and lowe
