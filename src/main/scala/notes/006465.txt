History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9025**] is a 65 year old gentleman with a history of CMML
and recurrent AML who presents for induction chemotherapy.
Patient underwent induction chemotherapy in [**2151-8-20**],
complicated by renal failure and need for hemodialysis for
several weeks.  Patient was in remission for over a year and was
found to have recurred by labs in clinic.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
preferred that he be admitted tonight in case his counts rapidly
increase.  He continues on Hydrea daily and allopurinol. He
feels well now.
.
On review of systems, patient has persistent dry cough since
[**Month (only) 956**].  He also notes reflux symptoms exacerbated by
movement, actively sitting up or lying down. He does note that
his fatigue has been worsening over the last couple of weeks,
though he is still able to care for himself independently at
home.  He notes that he has chronic post-nasal drip for years
which has not affected his cough in the past.  He denies fevers,
chills, sweats, congestion, dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, chest
pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, rashes, bleeding, easy bruising, weight changes.

Past Medical History:
- Chronic Monocytic Myelogenous Leukemia
- Acute Myelogenous Leukemia s/p induction [**10/2151**] and
re-induction therapy
- Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 3.0-3.5,
required temporary hemodialysis while on induction therapy with
7+3 in [**2151**]
- Non-obstructive nephrolithiasis --> ?Urate Nephropathy
- Brief hospitalization in [**2151**] for [**Last Name (un) **] and gross hematuria
- Right sided inguinal hernia - per CT, contains predominantly
fat, not bowel
- Splenomegaly
- GERD - duodenitis
- Eczema - severe
- Asthmatic bronchitis, diagnosed in [**2139**]
- Herpes zoster, [**2144**].
- Erectile dysfunction beginning in [**2139**] with
hypotestosteronemia.
- S/p removal of a "lump" from right arm, at dorsal site where
elbow rubs tableside.
- Basal cell cancer, removed from his nose in Spring [**2148**].

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
CMML
- [**7-/2146**]-sumer [**2151**] followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
- [**2151**] summer - transformation to AML and rise in baseline Cr
--> care transferred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], started on Hydrea
- [**2151-8-20**] - induction chemotherapy w idarubicin and ARA-C
(7+3), cut short [**2-20**] worsening renal dysfunction, requiring HD
for several weeks; renal dysfunction [**2-20**] tumor lysis syndrome vs
tumor infiltration vs ATN
- Re-induction chemotherapy [**2-20**] persistent AML upon restaging
marrow; re-induction done while still on HD in [**2151**]

and remission of AML ; started on Hydrea, which he has been
taking intermittently
- persistent renal insufficiency not requiring HD
- [**2152-4-4**] -- hospitalized w abd pain, constipation, CT showed
hydronephrosis and stones --> likely Urate Nephropathy, was
started on allopurinol ; [**2153-4-10**] ultrasound showed slight
improvement of hydronephrosis ; pt followed by nephrology as
outpatient ; [**4-11**] returned for gross hematuria
- new lymphadenopathy per CT scan in [**Month (only) **]
- [**2153-4-6**] Bone Marrow consistent with CMML, still in remission
for AML
- Allogenic transplant and post-remission chemotherapy were
deffered in setting of renal failure
.
With Induction therapy,
patient received the following doses of Idarubicin:
[**2151-7-28**]: 9mg/m2=18mg
[**2151-7-29**]: 6mg/m2=12mg
.
[**2151-9-7**]: 12mg/m2=23mg
[**2151-9-8**]: 12mg/m2=23mg
[**2151-9-9**]: 12mg/m2=23mg
.
Total Cumulative dose=51mg/m2

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9025**] is a 66-year-old man with CMML with recurrent AML,
presenting for another round of induction chemotherapy.
.
Patient has been in remission for one year after induction and
re-induction chemotherapy.  Bone Marrow biopsy was performed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**6-15**] to reassess disease.  Spleen is massive
in size. Patient has lifetime limit of anthracycline dosing
which should allow for MEC induction therapy. CBC Diff shows
~14% blasts which is elevated from prior, but counts 4 days ago
showed 12% blasts.  Concern by outpatient hematologist that
patient may develop urgent need for chemotherapy in next couple
of days, which is why he was admitted today rather than on
Monday night. Pt started induction chemotherapy on Tuesday
[**2153-6-19**] with MEC which was dose reduced and given with HD support
with the renal team. He was incidentally found to have
asymptomatic coag neg staph bacteremia in multiple BCx bottles
and his chemo was stopped so he only received 3/5 doses. This
was concerning as his counts dropped but still was noted to have
blasts in his peripheral blood, concerning for inadequate chemo
dose. His line was pulled and he was treated with vanc. Another
line was placed and the pt was doing well until on [**6-30**] he
developed acute neutropenic sepsis with 3/3 bottles of
pan-sensitive pseudomonas. Due to hypotension and fevers >103 he
was sent to the ICU overnight with broad spectrum abx and
pressors. He was sent back to the floor the next day and
improved. Per ID he was on vanc, cefepime, vori at this time
(d/c'd cipro as no need for double coverage for pansens
pseudomonas). he was improving until [**7-7**] when he was
