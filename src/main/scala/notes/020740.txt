Radiology report: US HEMATOMA SUBCUT DRAIN INCISION  [**2172-5-30**]
10:31 AM

Preprocedure ultrasound demonstrated a large, complex,
multiloculated collection in the dome of the liver. An optimal
entry site was identified with ultrasound. The area was cleansed
and draped in the usual sterile fashion and 1% lidocaine was
administered locally.

Utilizing realtime ultrasound guidance, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4300**] needle was
inserted into the collection with proper positioning confirmed
with ultrasound. A wire was introduced through the needle into
the collection. After serial dilatation, an 8 French, [**Last Name (un) 2823**]
catheter was placed into the collection with proper positioning
confirmed. The catheter was secured in place. Approximately 300
cc of thin, yellow liquid was removed. Samples were sent to the
laboratory for analysis, as requested.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate
complications.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 82 year old gentleman with chronic respiratory
failure s/p tracheostomy with ventilator dependency, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, and
congestive heart failure.  He presented in septic shock likely
secondary to med problems with a likely liver abscess.  Broad
spectrum antibiotics were started (vancomycin).  It was clear
the liver abscess would need to be drained; however the patient
was markedly coagulopathic on presentation.  Multiple units of
fresh frozen plasma and along with IV vitamin K was give.
Amidst this a central line was placed.  The INR finally returned
as 1.8 and he was taken for ultrasound guided drainage of the
liver abscess; 300 cc were removed and there were no
complications.  The patients hemodynamics improved with fluids,
antibiotics, and lastly the drain.  With improvement he was
cautiously diuresed.  He was initially maintained on assist
control ventilation; after the drainage he was transitioned to
pressure support ventilation.
.
#Liver Abscess- in the presence of leukocytosis, intermittent
abd pain. CT scan from outside hospital with evidence of
abscess. Elevated alk phos, transaminases. Percutaneous IR
drainage successfully done [**5-31**]. Unclear etiology. Biliary
source, stone, pyelonephritis, endocarditis are possibilities.
No evidence of trauma. Likely fluid collection peri hepatic from
recent hospitalization which became infected leading to sepsis.
However, cultures did not grow out and the collection was mainly
lymphocytic w negative gram stain and negative cultures.
-sputum with klebsiella (ESBL) and MRSA.  Other pan cultures,
blood, urine, and from drainage procedure have yet to grow
organism.
-broad spectrum abx with meropenem and vancomycin started [**5-30**].
Flagyl also started [**5-30**], d/c'ed [**6-3**]. Followed vanco trough
levels; went from 1gram q48 to 1 gram q24 to 750mg q24. Next
dose should be 750 mg at 8 pm on [**6-5**]. Continue meropenem/vanco
for 14 day course (from [**5-30**]) to empirically cover any remnant
of abscess.
-CT scan torso
-Surgery and GI followed
-initially a question of whether additional portion of the
collection was a loculated and drainable portion, and question
of whether to readjust drain; day of discharge decision made
that this portion was possibly solid and that additionally
without evidence of infectious process that drainage would not
yield much benefit.
-Dressing for pulled hepatic drain was DSD--remove after 24
hours, can be replaced with band-aid, changed PRN (drain pulled
12:00 [**6-5**])
.
#Hypotension-likely sepsis. FFP, products and fluids. Pressors
as needed to maintan MAP>65.
-Broad spectrum antibiotics
-[**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test, had appropriate response; no indication for
steroids.
-central line placed [**5-30**] am; pulled before d/c; PICC placed
[**6-3**]
-IVF
.
#Respiratory failure- s/p trach, likely complicated by sepsis.
Also could be complicated by likely PNA with ESBL klebsiella and
MRSA growing in sputum
-antibiotics as above
-initially maintained on AC, now transitioned to pressure
support ventilation. During admission periodically went on AC at
night to rest pt. Most recent night-time AC setting: Vt 600, RR
14, MV [**10-21**]. On this had RSBI of 127. Did not wean from
pressure support. [**6-4**] unable to wean from [**9-11**] PS to [**4-11**].
.
#Anion gap metabolic acidosis- Non elevated lactate, PH 7.21.
Bicarb of 9. Consider related to acute renal failure.  Now
resolved
.
#ARF- Creatinine to 2.6. Consider ATN related to hypotension,
hypovolemia, septic emboli.  Appears to have resolved.
.
#[**Name (NI) 10809**] pt on coumadin for a fibb, level at 6.9. Consider
related to acute hepatic failure. Coumadin held. Multiple units
of FFP and Vitamin k Given. INR currently subtherapeutic. Now on
heparin drip.
- Per IR recs can start Coumadin after 24 hours (i.e., [**6-6**]
after 12 noon) s/p removal of IR drain.
.
#Opacity right lung base- Question of pneumonia, wih opacity,
trach chronic. Afebrile, no leukocytosis.
-Klebsiella from sputum [**5-27**], MRSA in sputum as well
-vanc and meropenem.
.
#Hyperglycemia,? DM- sliding scale insulin. Check urine for
ketones given anion gap acidosis.
-consider checking A1c
.
#CAD-hx of MI in [**2156**]
.
#CHF, diastolic-held lasix in the setting of infection and
hypotension.  Since these have resolved, have cautiously
restarted.
Repeat CXR in AM.
.
#Atrial fibril
