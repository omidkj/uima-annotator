ambulation. No weight gain, LE edema. Difficult to assess
functional capacity but worsening SOB, DOE over past months.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the LAA. Cannot exclude LAA thrombus.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Mild
global LV hypokinesis. Mildly depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Moderately
dilated ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending
aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.


AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Increased
transaortic velocity related to increased stroke volume due to
AR. Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) AR. Eccentric AR jet.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**]
to co-existing AR, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral
valve area may be an OVERestimation of true area. Moderate to
severe (3+) MR. Uninterpretable LV inflow pattern due to MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Mild [1+]
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. A left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be excluded.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
