Service:  SICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred here for inability to wean
ventilator.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female
with a history of "severe" COPD with recent upper respiratory
tract infection who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with a COPD
exacerbation and was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory
failure (ABGs 7.26/59/89) and is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.  During her stay at [**Hospital1 46**], the
patient was started on Levaquin, IV steroids, and
theophylline.  She was noted to have runs of SVT at 120 beats
per minute with inferolateral ST depressions in the setting
of agitation and bronchospasms.  The patient was initially
given Cardizem in addition to digoxin and then changed to
Amiodarone load on [**2163-5-16**].  The patient was also
febrile twice up to 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit, last on [**2163-5-16**].  The patient was originally hospitalized at [**Hospital3 6265**] on [**2163-5-11**].

Her urine culture was showing more than 100,000 gram-positive
cocci which eventually grew out Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Her blood cultures were no growth to date.  Her white blood
cell count went from 9,000 to 6,000 to 18,000 to 16,000 to
23,000 here at [**Hospital1 **].  Her transthoracic echocardiogram at the
outside hospital was reportedly with a normal EF, moderate
MR, moderate TR, normal regional wall motion.  She ruled out
for a myocardial infarction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  "Severe COPD".  No PFTs on record here.  She was
currently being evaluated for home oxygen.
2.  Basal cell carcinoma.
3.  Anemia.
4.  Status post cholecystectomy.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  History of SVT or paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.
7.  Spontaneous intramuscular hematoma.

AT HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Digoxin.
2.  Verapamil.
3.  Flovent.
4.  Combivent.
5.  Synthroid.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Levaquin 500 mg IV q.d., started on [**2163-5-11**].
2.  Protonix 40 IV q.d.
3.  Synthroid 100 micrograms q.d.
4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg IV q.d.
5.  Solu-Medrol 40 mg q. eight hours.
6.  Nitroglycerin paste 2 inches q. eight.
7.  Amiodarone 600 mg p.o. b.i.d.

likely secondary to urinary culture.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quite tobacco in [**2155**].  She has
several daughters that are ICU nurses.  She lives at home
with her son.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of CAD or MI.  Otherwise,
unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
99.8, heart rate 98, BP 127/71, respiratory rate 13, 02
saturation 97% on AC 650/12/5/0.40 with an ABG on this
setting of 7.43/53/86.  General:  She is an elderly female
sedated on the mechanical ventilation.  HEENT:  The
oropharynx is dry.  The skin turgor is okay.  No appreciable
elevated JVP.  Lungs:  Scattered wheezes.  Poor air movement.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive
bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  No
edema, no cyanosis.  Neurologic:  Pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Follows simple commands.  Later in her
hospital course she was diffusely weak with strength of
approximately 3+/5 throughout, symmetric.  Cranial nerves II
through XII were intact.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Please refer to CCD for most of
the laboratories.  Pertinent laboratories included a white
count in the 20,000 range which progressed to a bandemia of
12% bands.  Platelets were within normal limits.  Coagulation
profile within normal limits.  First U/A was negative.
Second U/A on [**2163-5-22**] showed 6 white blood cells and
less than 1 epithelial, large blood, 9 red blood cells, trace
protein, occasional white blood cell clusters.  Electrolytes
upon admission revealed a primary metabolic alkalosis and
concomitant respiratory acidosis.  Renal function was within
normal limits.  She ruled out for myocardial infarction times
three.  The LFTs were within normal limits.  LDL 72, HDL 66,
triglycerides 119, iron studies within normal limits with the
exception of ferritin at 193.  TSH was normal at 2.5.  SPEP
and UPEP were pending.  Digoxin level 1.2, lactate 0.8.
Cultures at the time of transfer from the SICU to the floor
were showing no growth.  This culture data could change based
on her progression on the floor.

She had a head CT without contrast that showed air-fluid
levels within the bilateral maxillary sinuses and right
sphenoid and ethmoid air cells.  No intracranial hemorrhage.
Please see full report.

HOSPITAL COURSE IN THE SICU:  1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Thought to be secondary to COPD exacerbation.  Hypercarbic on
presentation with acute respiratory acidosis.  She was
extubated on rounds on [**2163-5-19**], the day after
admission, after she tolerated pressure support 5 and 5 well.
Shortly after which, she developed hypertension and
difficulty breathing so she was passed on BIPAP, given
nitroglycerin and 20 mg of IV Lasix which resolved. She
eventually was maintained on 02 by nasal cannula and did
well.  Her IV Solu-Medrol was continued for several days as
she was quite wheezy on examination.  She was changed to p.o.
prednisone when she was taking p.o. food well and when it was
thought that her COPD had resolved.  Additionally, she
completed a seven day course of levofloxacin  at the outside
hospital for pneumonia/bronchitis.  A sputum culture was
obtained and is pending at the time of transfer to the floor.

2.  METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  Likely secondary to
hyperventilation with respiratory compensation.  The patient
was extubated as she was likely being overventilated and this
resolved.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Coronary wise, this patient had ST
depressions and T wave inversions in the inferolateral leads.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction.  She was continued
on aspirin.  She was not started on a beta blocker given her
severe COPD.  Cardiology was consulted and there was no need
for inpatient catheterization at this time.

4.  RHYTHM:  Cardiology was consulted given her runs of SVT
in the 120s.  They suggested discontinuing Amiodarone and
digoxin and it is unclear what her rhythm actually was.  It
seemed to start suddenly and end suddenly and she did not
display any signs of hemodynamic instability while in the ICU
when she did bounce up to the 120s in her heart rate.  Some
telemetry strips appeared to be paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.  However, the thought that these runs of SVT
are likely secondary to her lung disease and thus no
anticoagulation is needed at this time. She may need an
elective EP study as an outpatient for consideration for
pacemaker placement. She may also need an outpatient Holter
monitor to actually better clearly define these runs of SVT.
She was started on Diltiazem and this was titrated up for her
atrial tachycardia.  Additionally, on [**2163-5-20**], she had
nine beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.

5.  PUMP:  Her digoxin was discontinued and she had a normal
EF on the transthoracic echocardiogram at the outside
hospital.

6.  HYPERTENSION:  Her ACE inhibitor and digoxin were
titrated up given her blood pressure.

7.  URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  She showed more than 100,000
Gram-positive cocci plus positive leukocyte esterase and many
white blood cells on the U/A at the outside hospital and thus
she was treated with three days of ampicillin.  Her Foley was
changed out and a repeat U/A and urine culture was sent.  On
the day of transfer to the floor, a repeat U/A showed some
white blood cells and some white blood cell clumps and thus
she was started on levofloxacin.  She was afebrile; however,
this is in the setting of IV Solu-Medrol.

8.  LEUKOCYTOSIS/LEFT SHIFT:  Originally thought to be
secondary to steroids; however, upon repeat check of the
differential this was clearly a bandemia with myelocytes as
well indicating a severe left shift.  An Infectious Disease
workup ensued as the pat
