Service:  CME


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
CAD, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 75
percent, COPD, chronic renal insufficiency with baseline
creatinine of 1.4, presented with increasing shortness of
breath this morning.  Denied any fevers, chills, night
sweats.  Noted some productive cough with white sputum.  PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] 10-pound weight gain over 1 month.  Denied dietary
indiscretions, chest pain, or palpitations.  In the emergency
department, her room air saturation was noted to be 82
percent.  Chest x-ray was consistent with massive CHF.  She
was put on non-re-breather, developed decline in mental
status.  An ABG revealed pH of 7.07, PCO2 of 120, PAO2 of 97,
subsequently intubated for hypercarbia, after having tried
BiPAP without success.  She was started on Natrecor drip for
diuresis in the setting of creatinine of 1.7.  She was
transferred to the cardiac care unit.  Her endotracheal tube
was found to be kinked, and after repositioning, her peak
inspiratory pressures improved.  She had improving urine
output on Natrecor and improved blood pressure.

DRIPS:  Propofol 40 mcg/minute, Natrecor 0.01 mcg/kg,
ventilator was AC 500/20, FiO2 of 60 percent, peak
inspiratory pressures of 40, PEEP of 8.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.8 degrees, heart rate
76, blood pressure 118/41, respirations 18, saturation 82
percent on room air, 98 percent on non-rebreather, 95 percent
on ventilator.  Generally intubated, sedated.  HEENT:  Mucous
membranes moist.  Obese neck.  Pulmonary:  Bilateral diffuse
wheezes and rales.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, obese, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
1+ lower extremity edema to the thighs bilaterally, 1+
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.7, hematocrit 35.5, platelets
330,000.  INR 1.1.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 99,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 40, creatinine 1.7, glucose 328, CK 218,
MB of 5, troponin-T of 0.07.  ABG was 7.07, 120, and 97 at 7
p.m.  At 8 p.m., it was 7.29, 66, and 303.  Echocardiogram
from [**6-17**] was 1+ MR, right ventricular hypertrophy, an
ejection fraction of 75 percent.  EKG was normal sinus rhythm
at 80 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals, acute
present in lead III, lateral T-wave flattening.  Chest x-ray
consistent with CHF with bilateral effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Congestive heart failure.  Severe diastolic
dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 75 to 80 percent.
Found to be in massive CHF on chest x-ray.  She was continued
on Natrecor in addition to IV Lasix drips to diurese her.
Initial diuresis was good, although she tapered off with poor
urine output to maximum dose of Natrecor and Lasix IV.  She
was continued on aspirin, Cozaar, and she was started on a
Diltiazem drip for heart rate control with aggressive heart
rate control in the 50s to 70s with still poor diuresis.

Coronary artery disease.  She was continued on aspirin.  Her
[**Last Name (un) **], her beta-blocker was held in the setting of CHF.  She
was ruled out for myocardial infarction by cycled cardiac
enzymes.

Pulmonary history of COPD.  She was continued on Atrovent,
and her FiO2 was minimized to minimize hypercarbia.  The
patient with a history of extreme oxygen sensitivity with
minimal amounts of oxygen therapy causing hypercarbia.

Hypertension.  The patient had a hypotensive episode on
sedation, but her blood pressure improved with aggressive
heart rate control in CCU.

Non-insulin diabetes mellitus.  All of her oral agents were
held, q.i.d. fingersticks were continued, and sliding scale
insulin was continued.  She was eventually transitioned to an
insulin drip.

Chronic renal insufficiency, likely secondary to hypertension
and diabetes.  The patient's creatinine at baseline on
admission, but her creatinine worsened with Natrecor and
maximum-dose Lasix.

Code.  The patient initially was full code when she came in,
but after discussion with her 3 daughters about her poor
prognosis, it was decided that she would be DNR/DNI and
comfort measures only.  The patient was subsequently
extubated on [**2132-3-12**] when her ventilation was optimized.
She continued having difficulty with ventilating and
oxygenation, likely secondary to her blunted hypercarbic
drive.  Her oxygen was titrated to saturations of 88 to 90
percent.  The patient subsequently deceased on [**2132-3-13**] at
6:44 a.m. due to acute renal failure and massive CHF.  The
family was notified and requested an autopsy.
