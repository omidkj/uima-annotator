Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12056**] is an 84F with hx of dementia, HTN s/p gamma nail
procedure for acute right intertrochanteric fracture and
avulsion of the lesser trochanter on [**12-19**], who presents s/p
cardiac arrest. Pt was discharged from [**Hospital1 **] yesterday to Goaddard
house. This AM staff found her in respiratory distress (VS: BP
150/68, p 64, RR 24 O22 sat 89-90%, Temp 96.4) and called 911.
When EMS arrived they noted she was apneic and pulseless. She
went into PEA arrest, was intubated and was given 3 rounds of
epi and atropine. EKG changed to accelerated idioventricular
rhythm with pulsues. Pulse was lost again and epi was given. She
then converted to pulseles vtach and was shocked and returnd to
a narrow complext SVT with return of pulses and BP 124/P.
.
In the ER the pt was noted to have fixed dilated pupils. She was
tachycardic to the 160s in an SVT, she was shocked at 100 J with
transient conversion to NSR. She was given 150 mg IV amiodarone.
Her HR then dropped to the 80s and she was given atropine 1 mg
and epi 1 mg with no pulse. Compressions were initiated and she
was given 20 units of vasopressin with return of her pulse. She
was given levaquin,flagyl and cefepime and a right femoral line
was placed in the ER. After discussion with her HCP it was
determined that she was DNR/DNI. Pt was had a CT of the head and
CTA and was sent to the ER.

.
CTA chest:

1. No pumonary embolism.
2. Atelectasis of the left lower lobe and a mix of consolidation
and atelectasis of left upper lobe. Findings are consistent with
aspiration and post- obstructive pneumonitis superimposed on
left upper lobe pneumonia.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Interstitial edema.
5. Nasogastric tube in a high position with tip near the
gastroesophageal junction and side hole in the lower esophagus.
Advancement suggested.
6. 5-mm left ureteropelvic junction stone may be obstructing but
evaluation of the left kidney is limited as it was included only
on the non-contrast series.

Brief Hospital Course:
*cardiopulmonary arrest:  Ms. [**Known lastname 12056**] was an 84F with a hx of
dementia, HTN s/p gamma nail procedure for acute right
intertrochanteric fracture and avulsion of the lesser trochanter
on [**12-19**], who presented s/p cardiac and respiratory arrest.  As
per the above HPI, the pt was found to be in respiratory
distress and then went into PEA arrest and later pulslesss VT
for which she was rescuscitated.  She was intubated in the
field. In the ER she was started on abx, pressors and had a
femoral line placed.  She had a CTA negative for PE and a CT
head. After d/w her HCP it was then discovered she was DNR/DNI.
She was then brought to the ICU.  Her HCP, Mr. [**Name (NI) 67377**] (nephew)
was contact[**Name (NI) **] again and the options of whether to pursue
aggressive care vs. continuation of care without escalation vs.
transition to CMO was discussed with him. After discussion with
her Mr [**Last Name (Titles) 67377**], it was determined that she was DNR/DNI and this
was discussed at her last admission.  He confirmed that the
patient would not want to be kept alive on life support.  He
came to the hospital with several family members and after their
arrival the pt's abx and pressors were stopped and the
ventilator was turned off. She expired shortly thereafter with
her family at the bedside.
