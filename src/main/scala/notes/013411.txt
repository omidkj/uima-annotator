HOSPITAL COURSE:  This pleasant 50-year-old female was
admitted postoperatively for routine care after undergoing
her surgery on [**2192-1-17**].  On postoperative day 0, she
was doing well and had no problems; however, on the morning
of on postoperative day 12, after having her NG tube
discontinued and fluids discontinued, the patient was found
to be with an oxygen desaturation down to 88 on room air, 95
percent on a room breather.

The patient was evaluated bu the Surgical Service and
underwent a series of test and at that point underwent a CT
which found a pulmonary embolism.  The patient was taken to
the Trauma SICU for admission after undergoing her scan.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified, and the patient was started on a
heparin drip.

The CTA demonstrated potential flow defect, and a left upper
quadrant arterial line was placed, and the patient had her NG
tube reinserted.  The patient was monitored, and on
postoperative day 2, the 13th, the patient was started on
Levaquin for presumed pneumonia as illustrated on her chest x-
ray and CT scan.

The patient was transferred out of the unit on the 13th, and
on the 14th, the patient had received 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. on
Friday, and then on the 15th received an additional 5 mg;
however, her INR on the 14th was 2.3, and 4.5 on the 15th.
She unfortunately did receive that dose of Coumadin on the
16th, and her INR jumped to 5.6 on [**1-22**].  Her Coumadin
was held, and on [**1-23**], her INR was 3.8.  The patient
was started on 2 mg of Coumadin and given 1 dose.  Her repeat
INR on the day of discharge, [**1-24**], was 2.3, and the
patient was discharged with 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. and was
instructed that she needs to have her blood drawn at her
primary care physician's office tomorrow.  Her primary care
physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 3314**] who was notified.  He is
unfortunately unavailable at this time, and we spoke with the
Surgical Service contact, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29478**] [**Name (STitle) 50258**], and the number
there is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3183**].

The patient continued her dose of Levaquin for a total of
seven days.  Her last dose was on the day of discharge for
presumed pneumonia.  Her heparin was discontinued on the
15th, and the patient was monitored.  She continued to have
low oxygen saturations, but with aggressive pulmonary toilet
and some Lasix on Sunday, the 16th as well, as well as Monday
the 17th, the patient appeared to improve on chest x-ray, as
well as clinically.  Her oxygen saturation on the day of
discharge is 93 percent on room air.  She was instructed to
risks and benefits of Coumadin, and she agreed to take
Coumadin as prescribed by her primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
was tolerating a regular diet at that point, and she was
transferred from the unit to the floor on [**2192-1-19**],
and did well otherwise.  She had no other complaints.

The patient was discharged to home with close follow-up.  She
was instructed again as to how important is for her to take
her Coumadin and that if she has any questions, she is to
either call her primary care physician's office or  Dr.[**Name (NI) 45689**] office.  Her goal INR will be [**2-9**].

She is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately two
weeks.  She is instructed that she cannot take any bread or
chips but can otherwise have a regular diet.  In addition,
all of her pills should be crushed.  She is to follow-up with
her primary care physician tomorrow and to get her INR level
checked and to schedule an appointment within a week for a
routine visit with her primary care physician.

plication on [**2192-1-17**].
