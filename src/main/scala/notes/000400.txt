CHEST TWO VIEWS, [**2134-2-14**]
FINDINGS:
Two views of the chest compared to prior study from [**2134-2-11**].
There is
multifocal interstitial and airspace opacification, not
appreciably changed from the prior study, could represent a
combination of congestive failure or even ARDS. Heart is
enlarged. Mediastinum is within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: Left PICC unchanged in superior vena cava.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). No resting LVOT
gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV free wall thickness. Dilated RV
cavity. RV function depressed.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.
MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR). MVR
well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients.
TRICUSID VALVE: Bioprosthetic tricuspid valve (TVR). TVR well
seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for
PDA
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 70%). The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis
is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. A
bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present. The tricuspid
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2133-8-3**], the mitral and tricuspid valves have been
replaced. The right ventricle is somewhat hypocontractile.




Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2134-1-31**] for bridge from coumadin with heparin drip.
Completed preoperative workup and [**2134-2-1**] was brought to the
operating room and underwent mitral valve and tricuspid valve
replacements, see operative report for further details.   She
was transferred to the intensive care unit for postoperative
management.  In the first few hours she had significant
ventricular ectopy that was treated with amiodarone boluses and
drip with improvement however underlying rhythm was complete
heart block and continued to be paced with epicardial wires.
She remained intubated overnight for hemodynamics and was
extubated the morning of postoperative day one.  She was started
on lasix for diuresis due to pulmonary edema and continued
amiodarone.  Electrophysiology was consulted
