HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 7-year-old male
with a history of hypertension, high cholesterol, tobacco
use, and a family history of coronary artery disease, who
presented to an outside hospital with six or seven hours of
substernal chest pain rate at 9 out of 10 in intensity.  The
patient arrived intubated, and we were therefore unable to
obtain further information.  The patient took Maalox at home
with no improvement in symptoms.

Electrocardiogram at the outside hospital revealed a [**Street Address(2) 5366**]
elevation in V3-V6.  Blood pressure was 147/73, pulse 60,
oxygen saturation 96% on 2 L.  He received 2 in of
Nitroglycerin.  Chest pain decreased to 4 out of 10.  He was
given Aspirin 325 x 1, Morphine Sulfate 2 mg x 1.

The patient had a ventricular fibrillation arrest.  He was
shocked with 150 joules.  He received Lidocaine 100 mg IV
followed by Lidocaine drip.  He received Retrovase, total of
20 U.  He was started on a Nitroglycerin drip.  The patient
was intubated.  He received Ativan and .................., as
well as ..................  He had ventricular fibrillation
arrest times three.  He received 150 joules x 2 and 200
joules x 1.  He was given a Heparin bolus 5000 U and then
placed on Heparin drip at 1000 U/hr.  The patient was in
normal sinus rhythm following this set of shocks; however,
electrocardiogram showed persistent ST elevations, and he was
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  High cholesterol.
Asthma, about one flare per month on steroid taper and
............; he has never been intubated.  Stress test at
age 75 was normal per daughter.

MEDICATIONS:  Combivent, Albuterol, .................. 25 mg
q.d., antihypertensive (statin given of unknown name).

FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother died of heart attack at age 52.
Father died of cerebrovascular accident at age 52.  Another
brother died at age 70 with coronary artery disease.  Another
brother also had an myocardial infarction.  Another brother
died of rheumatic heart disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Tobacco, 40 pack years; quit two years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Weight 103 kg,
temperature 96.6??????, pulse 67, blood pressure 126/72, 100%
oxygen saturation, CVP 15, PA pressure of 36/25.  The patient
was on CMV, respiratory rate of 60, TV 650, PEEP 7.5, FIO2
100%, blood gases 7.44, 34, 212.  General:  The patient was
intubated, although he was following commands.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm.  Distant heart sounds.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation on anterior chest.  Abdomen:
Soft, obese, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Trace
edema.  Palpable 2+ dorsalis pedis on right, Dopplerable left
dorsalis pedis pulse.

LABORATORY DATA:  Potassium 2.6.  Cardiac catheterization was
performed showing a left dominant system, left anterior
descending of 90% proximal lesion stented, left circumflex
90% mid lesion, right coronary artery no flow limiting
disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially given extensive
medical treatment including Swan-Ganz catheter, arterial
line, Aspirin, Plavix, ACE inhibitors, Nitroglycerin, and
Lasix.

On [**2111-2-25**], the patient was taken to the Operating
Room by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] for acute stent failure status
post acute myocardial infarction.  Coronary artery bypass
grafting times three was performed, LIMA to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to LPD and OM.

The patient initially appeared to tolerate the procedure and
was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit
with chest tubes and pacing wires in place.  He required an
intravenous drip of Neo-Synephrine and Levophed.  He was also
initially on a drip of Propofol.

Over the next few ensuing days, the patient needed additional
drips of Nitroglycerin.  He was also given Lasix for his
positive fluid status.

On [**2111-2-27**], the patient's T-max was noted to 101.5??????.
The patient was pancultured.  Over the next few days, the
patient continued to have low-grade fevers, although his
cultures persistently were read as negative.

As the patient was allowed to be awakened, it became evident
that he was very confused, and the patient frequently
required Haldol.

Also on the Intensive Care Unit, it was noted that the
patient developed a sternal click although the sternum was
not erythematous and did not express any pus.  The Heart
Failure Service was also consulted to evaluate the patient's
heart failure and large positive fluid balance.  The patient
was started on Natrecor.  His Lasix was discontinued.  He was
started on Bumex.  His Diltiazem was discontinued.  He was
restricted to a 2 g sodium diet and restricted to a 1500 cc
fluid intake.

The patient was also put on p.o. Flagyl empirically for
possible C-diff.  Over the next few days, the patient's Bumex
and .................. were adjusted as needed.  The patient
was then discharged from the Intensive Care Unit and sent to
the regular floor.

Also while on the unit, the patient was placed on Vancomycin,
which was discontinued shortly after coming to the floor and
dosed intermittently due to the high creatinine.

The patient received a PICC line for future antibiotic and
blood draw needs.  Shortly after arriving to the floor, the
patient had a blood culture that was done in the Intensive
Care Unit which came back with a single bottle read of
Staphylococcus coagulase negative, for which the patient
continued to be treated.

Over the course of the next few days, the patient continued
to diurese, although he began to have increasing creatinine,
more so than previously.  His diuretics were revised, and he
was finally left on a regimen simply of Bumex 1 mg b.i.d.

On [**3-15**], it was noted that the patient's other leg wounds
had partially dehisced, approximately 2 cm.  Steri-Strips
were placed on either side of the incision to prevent the
dehiscence from expanding.  The area had no erythema and no
pus expressed.  Also the lower leg incision demonstrated
increased erythema indicative of a cellulitis.  No pus was
ever expressed.  The patient was continued on Vancomycin 1 g
dosed as needed.  He was also placed on Cipro 500 p.o. b.i.d.
He was also kept on Flagyl for unconfirmed C-diff.

Over the next couple of days, the patient's positive fluid
status continued to decrease.  His creatinine finally started
to fall.  The patient experienced periodic hypokalemia which
required replacement.

At the present date of [**2111-3-16**], the patient has
remained afebrile for a number of days.  His white count has
slowly begun to improve.  He remains on Vancomycin, Cipro and
Flagyl.  His leg erythema is improving.  It is anticipated
that he will be discharged tomorrow to a rehabilitation
facility.

He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks.  He is to
follow-up with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-11**] weeks.  He
is to follow-up with his cardiologist in [**1-12**] weeks.

The patient should strenuous activity.  He should also not
drive while on pain medication.  The patient may shower,
although he should avoid baths.

It is felt at this time that the patient no longer needs
diuretics and therefore will not be discharged on any
diuretics.  He will however be discharged on Vancomycin 1 g
q.d.  He is to have a trough level drawn tomorrow night prior
to his fourth consecutive dosing.  He will be discharged on
