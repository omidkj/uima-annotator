History of Present Illness:
69 yo male with h/o of 3 strokes since [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 10%, DM, HTN,
HL, CRI, ? protein S deficiency who presents with PNA and severe
sepsis. He was sent to the ED from [**Hospital1 **] of [**Location (un) **] for
evaluation of elevated WBC 28.3 today and elevated INR 5.22
yesterday and 3.65 today. The original plan was for transport by
EMS to NW but the ambulance was diverted to [**Hospital1 **] after there was
concern for vtach.
.
Vitals on arrival to the ED were 100.8 PR HR120 BP 131/94 RR19
85% RA. CXR was noted for a right sided PNA and pt had decreased
BS in lower right lung. Labs were notable for a lactate of 4.4,
WBC of 26.4, and HCT of 55 (49 is recent baseline). INR was 3.4.
Creatinine was 1.9 (recent baseline 1.5). Blood cx were drawn
and UA was negative for infection. EKG showed sinus tachycardia
with LBBB consistent with prior. He received vancomycin 1gram
IVx1 and levofloxacin 500mg IVx1. Cefepime was ordered but not
administered prior to arrival to the ICU. He received a 250cc
bolus of fluid and then fluid at 150cc/hr given low EF. he was
guaiac negative. Vitals prior to transfer were 98.6 Hr 120 BP
146/82 RR25 100% 4L NC.
.
Partient was most recently hospitalized here in 9/[**2187**]. Of note
he has had 3 strokes since [**5-/2188**] the first of which occured the
day prior to his planned ICD placement for EF of 10%. After
review of recent d/c summary and discussion with HCP patient is
at baseline able to follow basic commands. He was able to walk
on last discharge. He had trace right sided upper extremity
weakness. He is aphasic. He was able to sing Happy Birthday
reasonably well. Mr. [**Known lastname 35914**] had a swallowing study with video.

A cutaneous skin examination including the face, neck,
trunk, back and bilateral upper and lower extremities reveals
the
following pertinent findings:
-- Left LE with well demarcated large ecchymotic, purpuric
plaque with irregular borders, some with retiform pattern with
superficial errosions. The ankle area is also noted for large
vesicle with confluent fluid. This area is tender to palpation.
Pt holding left leg with contracted knee and external rotation.
The whole leg from knee down if very cool to touch, cyanosis of
left foot.
-- Right LE also cool to touch from shin down, with areas of
erythematous papules with scab over it and linear areas of
excoriation wich appers to be to scratching scratching.

Discharge PE:
GEN: More alert today but still not following commands. NAD.
HEENT:  PERRLA. MMM.
Cards: RRR S1/S2 normal. no murmurs/gallops/rubs.
Pulm: No dullness to percussion, CTAB no crackles or wheezes
anteriorly
Abd: soft, NT, +BS. no rebound/guarding. neg HSM. neg [**Doctor Last Name 515**]

Lower Extremities: Feet cold and mottled bilaterally. No
peripheral pitting edema. Left shin bandaged with some areas of
erythema extending beyond the bandage demarcations.

Imaging:

CXR [**11-8**]: Large right pleural effusion with hazy opacity,
particularly of the right lung base. Some prominent infectious
infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded. Hazy left retrocardiac
opacity likely indicates atelectasis, although multifocal nature
of pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
Left Hip [**11-9**]: Two views of the left hip demonstrate no
fracture or malalignment.
.
CT Pelvis [**11-9**]: 1. No occult left hip or pelvic fracture is
identified. Osteopenia limits evaluation for subtle fractures,
and if there is continued clinical concern, bone scan or MRI
could be considered for further evaluation. 2. Degenerative
changes in the bilateral hips and lumbosacral spine. 3. Sigmoid
diverticulosis without diverticulitis. 4. Anasarca, which also
likely accounts for small amount of free fluid seen in the
pelvis.
.
CXR Portable [**11-10**]: In comparison with the study of [**11-8**], there
is diffuse haziness of the right hemithorax consistent with
large pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis. The
difference in the previous study reflects the change from an
upright to supine position. Retrocardiac opacification is
consistent with atelectasis and effusion. The possibility of
supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the
appropriate clinical setting. The pulmonary vessels are
difficult to evaluate, though there is no definite
central engorgement.
.
LENIs Bilateral [**11-10**]: Non-occlusive thrombus within the left
superficial femoral and popliteal veins.
.
US Extremity [**11-10**]: No evidence of left lower extremity [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**]
cyst.
.
CT Ab-Pelvis [**11-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Thrombosis of the mid SMA with distal revascularization by
collateral vessels. No evidence of bowel pneumatosis or specific
signs of bowel ischemia although this cannot be excluded.
2. Bilateral wedge-shaped hypodensities in the inferior poles of
both
kidneys, concerning for infarction. Patent renal arteries
bilaterally.
3. Complete occlusion of the common femoral arteries bilaterally
with distal reconstitution of the SFA/popliteal artery on the
left. Complete occlusion of distal flow on the right. No venous
enhancement in the lower extremities bilaterally, concerning for
extensive venous thrombosis or delayed venous return due to poor
arterial flow.
4. 8-mm filling defect in the left atrium. Though this study is
not gated for cardiac imaging, this finding is concerning for
thrombus within the heart or possibly a mass.
5. Large right and moderate left-sided pleural effusions with
associated atelectasis.
6. Moderate ascites as well as stranding within the
mesenteric/retroperitoneal fat and subcutaneous tissues
consistent with anasarca.
