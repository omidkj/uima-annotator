History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22771**] is an 81 year old Spanish speaking male who was
recently diagnosed with pulmonary embolus in [**2105-12-6**] and
has been anticoagulated with Warfarin. Since that time, he has
continued to complain of pleuritic chest pain. On the day of
admission, the patients VNA found him diaphoretic and
complaining of chest pain, which was exacerbated by exertion.
The chest pain was substernal and did not radiate. EMS was
notified. At time of EMS arrival, his systolic blood pressure
was in the 80's. He received Aspirin and 250 cc of normal
saline. While in the EW, he continued to complain of chest pain.
EKG was remarkable for diffuse anterolateral ST depressions and
T wave inversions. He was started on intravenous Heparin and
Integrilin while being loaded with Plavix. Cardiac enzymes were
elevated: CK 703, MB 65, Troponin 0.59. An echocardiogram
revealed severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and extensive
apical akinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function was
moderately to severely depressed with an ejection fraction of
30%. Cardiology activated the cath lab but Mr. [**Known lastname 22771**]
initially refused. He was therefore admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 for
further medical management and evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22771**] was admitted with a NSTEMI. Given his acute
coronary syndrome, he initially remained on Integrilin. Heparin
was not continued as his prothrombin time remained
supratherapeutic. After discussion with his son, he became
amenable to cardiac catheterization. For several days, he
remained pain free on medical therapy and cardiac enzymes
continued to trend down. On hospital day four, he experienced
recurrent chest pain. He underwent cardiac catheterization on
[**1-25**] which revealed a left dominant system with left
main and LAD disease. The Left Main had a 70% long stenosis and
the LAD had a 90% stenosis at its origin. The LCX was a large
dominant vessel with only minor luminal irregularities and the
RCA was a small non-dominant vessel with an ostial 40% stenosis
and mild diffuse disease. Left ventriculography revealed severe
systolic dysfunction with anterior, anteroapical and
inferoapical akinesis.  The ejection fraction was 25-30%. Based
on the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted. He was
deemed a surgical candidate but surgical intervention was
initially delayed given his supratherapeutic prothrombin time
and recent Plavix and Integrilin. He was maintained on Heparin
and Nitro. Despite intravenous and medical therapy, he continued
to experience recurrent angina. He was taken back to the cath
lab for IABP insertion on [**1-27**]. His chest pain improved
but due to his instability, he underwent surgical
revascularization surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**1-28**]. For
surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
Following the operation, he was brought to the CSRU in stable
condition. His CSRU was complicated by recurrent ventricular
fibrillation. The EP service was consulted. He was started on
Amiodarone and required multiple defibrillations. A repeat
echocardiogram was performed and showed no major change from a
previous preop echocardiogram. His overall left ventricular
systolic function remained moderately to severely depressed.
There was global hypokinesis with akinesis of the distal LV and
apex. No LV thrombus was seen. Given concern for ischemia as a
source for his ventricular dysrhythmias, repeat cardiac
catheterization was performed to assess graft patency. All three
grafts were found to be patent. An ICD was placed on [**2106-2-3**].
Subsequently he made steady improvement and was anticoagulated
for atrial fibrillation. Warfarin was dosed for a goal INR
between 2.0 - 3.0. He tolerated medical therapy which included
Amiodarone, Digoxin, and beta blockade. No further ventricular
rrhythmias were noted. Digoxin levels were monitored and
titrated accordingly. He was eventually cleared for discharge
and transferred to rehab on [**2106-2-6**]. He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] as directed and will follow up with the EP service on
[**2-11**].
