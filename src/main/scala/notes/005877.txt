Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1)Swan-Ganz catheter
2)Cardiac catheterization
3)Biventricular ICD placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68M w/ with h/o CHF (EF 15%), CAD,
hypercholesterolemia, HTN, who presents with increasing SOB,
DOE, orthopnea. Has EF15% and Class IV CHF, has been
decompensating from a CHF standpoint over the past few days
(weight gain, orthopnea, cough). Despite weighing himself daily
and noting some weight loss, he is still above his reported dry
weight of 169.5 lbs by about 5 lbs and his symptoms have been
slowly progressing. Because his dosage of medications, most
notably Lasix, have been increased several times in the last
couple of weeks, he was referred in for admission for more
tailored diuresis.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope, or presyncope. He reports dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema.

Past Medical History:
1)CHF, NYHA Class IV (EF 15%)
2)CAD: Inferior MI in [**2166**] s/p PTCA, repeat PTCA in [**2167**]
3)Hyperlipidemia
4)Hypertension
5)Gout (diuresis induced)

Social History:
Denies current tobacco use although he is a former smoker and
quit in [**2148**]. No history of alcohol abuse; consumes [**2-16**]
drinks/night. He is retired and lives in [**State 32926**]

.
EKG ([**11-6**]): Sinus rhythm, left atrial abnormality, Left bundle
branch block with left axis deviation ,no previous tracing
available for comparison
.
EKG ([**11-14**]): Since previous tracing, ventricular pacing, probably
biventricular
.
Relevant Imaging:
1)[**Last Name (un) **] ([**11-6**]):Indistinct opacity in right lower lobe. Given
unilaterality and focality, atypical for edema though confluent
edema can peresent this way. An early developing pneumonia
cannot be excluded.
.
2)ECHO ([**11-6**]): 1. The left atrium is normal in size. 2. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The left ventricle appears dyssnchronous with 12
segment SD>33ms but the images were difficult. These findings
are c/w significant LV dysnchrony for which the patient may
benefit from CRT therapy. 3. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. 4.The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. 5. Mild thickness of the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 6.The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. 7.There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
3)Foot xray ([**11-12**]):No fracture. Mild talonavicular degenerative
change.
.
4)Cardiac cath ([**11-13**]):1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system revealed multi vessel coronary disease.
The LMCA had mild diffuse disease. The LAD had a 70% lesion
after a large D1 branch. The LCX had a 50% lesion before a
large, branching OM1. The RCA contained serial
lesions of 80% and 70% in the mid and distal vessel. 2. Left
ventriculography was not performed. 3. Central aortic pressure
was low at 86/55 prior to and throughout the procedure. 4.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the RCA with a 2.5 Bare metal
stent with no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow in the distal
vessel. (See PTCA comments)
5. Successful balloon angiplasty of the distal RCA lesion with a
30%
residual stenosis and stable grade B dissection at the
conclusion of the
procedure. (See PTCA comments)
.
5)ECHO ([**11-15**]):Compared with the findings of the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2187-11-7**], the left ventricular end
diasolic dimension is unchanged; the left ventricular ejection
fraction is slightly increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 68 yo male with h/o CHF (EF=15%), HTN, dyslipidemia
presents in decompensated CHF admitted for tailored therapy
prior to cath +/- ICD/BiV. Symptomatically improved with
diuresis.
.
1) CHF: Patient was initially symptomatic with significant SOB,
PND, and orthopnea. Initial dry weight on admission was 176 lbs.
He was given multiple doses of Lasix IV and responded well. A
Swan Ganz catheter was placed upon transfer to the CCU to
monitor his CVP and PCWP closely. His inital CVP and PCWP was 27
& 16 and decreased to 13 & 10 after several days of diuresis. He
was also started on a Nitroprusside drip for a short period of
time to reduce his afterload. Patient was continued on his home
regimen of Coreg, Digoxin, and Diovan. His Diovan was initally
increased to 160mg [**Hospital1 **] but was decreased to 80 [**Hospital1 **] because of
hyperkalemia.  Spironolactone was also stopped for this reason.
He was also restarted on his home dose of Lasix 80mg daily. He
was evaluated by EP for ICD placement. He underwent cardiac MRI
which suggested an EF out of proportion to degree of LV
dysfunction suggesting non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Mr. [**K
