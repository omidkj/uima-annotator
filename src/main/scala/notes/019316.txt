Admission Date:  [**2148-8-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2148-8-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2101-12-1**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]/MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year-old
female with a history of type 1 diabetes, end stage renal
disease status post failed renal transplant with subsequent
need for dialysis as well as coronary artery disease, status
post coronary artery bypass graft who presents with three
days of a history of cough productive of yellow sputum as
well as a sore throat and hoarseness.  The patient reported
that she felt unwell at dialysis the previous day and was
unable to complete the entire session.  She returned to
dialysis on the day of admission and had 1.5 liters of
ultrafiltration, but again felt unwell prompting an Emergency
Department visit.  The patient reported low grade
temperatures to 99.4 as well as fatigue and daytime
somnolence.  She also reports taking fewer po, S and vomited
times one in the Emergency Department.  On the morning of
admission she took 2 units of Lente as well as 8 units of
Humalog for a sliding scale.  She normally takes insulin in
the afternoon for her sliding scale, however, she did not
take any on the day of admission. She had taken few po's
during the day.  The patient does report sick contacts with
her son and husband having a cough. She denies recent travel.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Notable for negative dysuria, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, headache, stiff neck, pain, tenderness at her
hemodialysis site.  She also denies any chest pain or
shortness of breath.  Of note the patient has been on
Vancomycin for several months for a left great toe infection.
In the Emergency Department she received Azithromycin.

3.  Status post liver transplant.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative alcohol and tobacco use.  She is
married and works as an office manager.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for a sister with type 1 diabetes as
well as a mother who has coronary artery disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Cyclosporine 100 q.d.
2.  Prednisone 10 q.o.d.
3.  Azathioprine 50 q.d.
4.  Toprol 100 b.i.d.
5.  Lasix 120 b.i.d.
6.  Synthroid .25 q.d.
7.  Aspirin 81 q.d.
8.  Vancomycin 1 gram at hemodialysis.
9.  Lente and Humalog according to her insulin sliding scale.

ALLERGIES:  Ciprofloxacin, which causes a rash.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.5.  Pulse
86.  Blood pressure 114/63.  Respiratory rate 18.  O2 sat 96%
on room air.  In general, she is an obese female who is
pleasant, alert and oriented times three, mildly ill
appearing.  Her pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  Anicteric sclera.  No lymphadenopathy.  Her lungs
were notable for crackles at the left base, but were
otherwise clear to auscultation.  Cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a 2 out of 6 systolic
murmur heard best at the apex.  Her abdomen was soft and
obese, nontender, nondistended with decreased bowel sounds.
Lower extremity examination included no edema with left great
toe that was tender with no drainage or erythema.  Her
neurological examination was grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.1 with a
differential of 83% polys, 5% bands, 5% lymphocytes, 5%
monocytes, hematocrit 36.1, platelets 221.  Electrolytes
included a sodium of 128, potassium 6.5, chloride 87, bicarb
15, anion gap of .6, BUN 59, creatinine 2.2 and glucose of
585.  She had trace ketones.  Her urinalysis was notable for
large blood, 500 protein, 100 glucose, trace ketones.  She
had an electrocardiogram done on admission with normal sinus
rhythm at 95 beats per minute with normal intervals and new
ST depressions in 1, 2, AVL, V4-V6 as well as T wave
flattening in leads 3.  Her chest film was notable for a
bilateral lower lobe bronchial thickening consistent with
bronchitis as well as a left lower lobe bronchial pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Diabetic ketoacidosis:  The patient had
an anion gap acidosis with trace ketones and hyperglycemia on
admission.  Although it was not a clear cut diabetic
ketoacidosis and we do not know what her arterial blood gas
showed the patient has a history of type 1 diabetes as well
as decreased insulin use as well as possible infection all of
which are consistent with a potential diabetic ketoacidosis.
Given the anion gap the patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit and treated with an insulin drip.  The
[**Last Name (un) **] endocrine service was consulted and they continued to
provide recommendations throughout the course of her
admission.  She was kept on an insulin drip throughout her
Intensive Care Unit stay and on [**8-12**] the drip was shut off
with coverage with long acting insulin prior to stopping the
drip.  The anion gap had closed over the course of her
treatment and the patient was not felt to be in diabetic
ketoacidosis.  The patient was given two appointments at the
[**Hospital **] Clinic the first of which with an endocrinologist in
[**Month (only) 216**] and a second appointment was with a nutritionist.

2.  Pneumonia:  Although the patient was afebrile she has a
history of immunosuppression on Cyclosporin as well as Imuran
and the chest film is convincing enough that she was started
in the Emergency Department on Azithromycin, however, given
her immunosuppression the patient was given Ceftriaxone over
the course of her Intensive Care Unit stay and during her
time on the floor her chest film improved over the course of
her admission as well as her symptoms of cough as well as
fatigue.  On the day of discharge the patient was able to
walk around the floor without feeling any significant
discomfort and her fatigue on exertion had improved
significantly.  The patient was discharged with a total of a
fourteen day course of Azithromycin and Cefpodoxime that will
again be completed in a total of fourteen days.

3.  Paronychia:  The patient has a history of chronic
infection and has been treated chronically with Vancomycin.
Of note the patient had MRSA at one point growing out of the
toe.  The patient was wondering why she has been labeled as a
MRSA patient.  It is likely because of this infection.
Podiatry was consulted who did not make any change in
management plans.

4.  End stage renal disease:  The patient as a history of
diabetic nephropathy that ultimately resulted in an renal
transplant, however, the patient has failed on the renal
transplant and is again on the transplant list, but is
currently requiring hemodialysis.  The Renal Service was
consulted as she underwent hemodialysis as an inpatient.  The
immunosuppressive regimen was changed such that her Imuran
was discontinued altogether.  Her Cyclosporin was lowered to
50 q.d. and her Prednisone was changed from 10 q.o.d. to 10
q.d. The patient was recommended by the Renal Service to stop
her Cyclosporin altogether, however, she was resistant to
this, because her transplant surgeon wanted her to stay on
Cyclosporin.  This will be discussed as an outpatient with
her primary care physician and nephrologist.

5.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient has known severe
coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2147**] with electrocardiogram changes on admission.
It was concerning for active ischemia, however, as the
patient was treated for diabetic ketoacidosis, hydrated and
her pneumonia treated her electrocardiogram improved
significantly.  Her CK's were negative.  Her troponins were
mildly elevated, but trended down and given her renal failure
it was not felt to indicate an acute coronary syndrome. The
patient was seen by cardiology as an inpatient was to see her
outpatient cardiologist after discharge
