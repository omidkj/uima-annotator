Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Nasogastric tube placed and removed x2

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8072**] is a 86 year-old man with a history of HTN and
renal mass with hilar adenopathy concerning for RCC who was
admitted on [**3-19**] and is now being transferred to the MICU for
further care.
.
Initially presented to an OSH with worsening dyspnea x [**3-12**]
days--he has had dyspnea for several months with ongoing
malignancy workup involving the lungs and has been on oxygen for
several weeks. The patient was found to have an NSTEMI (OSH Trop
0.37 from 0.02 a week ago) and ARF (Cr 2.2 from 1.6). He was
given ASA; however, given that he had a mediastinoscopy on [**3-7**]
he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for thoracics eval prior to starting
a heparin gtt.
.
In our ED, initial HR 81, BP 119/60 with O2 sat of 95% on 4L.
EKG notable for new ST depressions in V5-V6. Cardiac enzymes
positive (Trop 0.46, CK: 123 MB: 10 MBI: 8.1). CXR with mild
overload, grossly unchanged from prior. Thoracics saw the
patient, and found no contraindication to anticoagulation,
therefore a heparin gtt was started. He was continued on his
home O2 (4L NC).
.
At ~3am a blood transfusion was begun.  As the transfusion was
completed, he was noted to be increasingly dyspneic with
decreasing O2 saturations, requiring NRB.  60mg of IV was given
and he improved though still required NRB.  A MICU consult was
requested and transfer was initiated.

Past Medical History:
1. Renal mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC
- s/p 2 non-diagnostic EBUS-TBNA complicated by ? of
pneumothorax vs. trapped RUL (stable)
- recent cervical mediastinoscopy and diagnostic bronchoscopy

2. RUL/RLL GGO
3. Hypertension
4. Memory loss
5. Anemia

Micro:

.
Radiology:
.
CXR [**3-18**]: IMPRESSION: Multifocal airspace opacity superimposed
on a background of chronic interstitial lung disease, with
recurrent pleural effusions. This could reflect pulmonary edema
or consolidation.
.
TTE [**3-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20
%) with global hypokinesis and thinned, akinetic basal inferior
and infero-lateral segments. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
CT chest [**3-21**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with severe emphysema and overlying
failure or infection (less likely). UIP is unlikely, given the
minimal areas of focal traction and minimal fibrotic changes.
2. Left ventricular enlargement.
3. Cholelithiasis. Known right renal mass.
4. Borderline mediastinal lymph nodes might be reactive.
5. Moderate right pleural effusion, unchanged.
.
[**2166-3-25**] Video swallow eval: Moderate-to-severe pharyngeal
dysphagia secondary to weakness with a right unilateral
component, as well as reduced laryngeal elevation, valve closure
and epiglottic deflection and decreased bolus propulsion,
resulting in persistent penetration and frequent aspiration with
all consistencies.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8072**] is an 86 yo M w/ h/o renal mass, HTN, mild dementia
who was admitted with SOB and quickly transferred to the ICU.

1. SOB:
Medical ICU Course:
The patient was transferred to the Medical ICU after developing
hypoxia during a blood transfusion on the floor. He was given
60mg of IV lasix with some improvement, but he still required a
non-rebreather and thus transfer was initiated. Echocardiogram
showed global hypokinesis with EF 15-20%, and chest xray showed
mild pulmonary edema with moderate pleural effusions. The
patient is a former smoker with emphysema, and had had
increasing outpatient O2 requirement over last few months. His
acute hypoxia partly coincides with receiving IVF for possible
cardiac catheterization and blood transfusion on the morning of
transfer. Initial differential included CHF, PE, PNA, and
lymphagitic spread of tumor, all coinciding with underlying
COPD. The patient was given multiple boluses of 60-80mg IV
lasix, with diuresis of 500cc->1L with each bolus. He required
CPAP for his first overnight stay, and was then transitioned to
high-flow face mask. Given initial concern for PE, CT angiogram
and LENIs were considered, however given patient's renal
insufficiency, it was decided that he should not receive IV
contrast. In addition, after his ECHO showed dramatically low EF
with pulmonary edema on imaging, suspicion for PE decreased and
LENIs were not obtained. Despite successful diuresis, the
patient continued to require high-flow facemask O2, and thus
Chest CT was obtained. Chest CT showed severe emphysema and
evidence of CHF. The patient got acutely better after starting
SoluMedrol, to the point of only requiring his baseline O2
supplementation of 4L via NC on transfer to the Medicine floor.
On the medical floor, the pt continued to improve at times on
room air and at others on shovel mask for humidification at
advice of ENT. He finished a 5 day course of solumedrol and
levofloxacin. He was continued on nebs with good effect. For his
CHF with EF 15-20%, he will need close cardiology follow up with
Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 3733**] to be arranged on Monday
