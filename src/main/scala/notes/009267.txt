Admission Date:  [**2149-9-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2149-9-20**]



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
female admitted with an unknown past medical history who was
transferred from an outside hospital secondary to hypothermia
to 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
The patient's son reportedly called the police to conduct a
safety check when his mother failed to make her routine call
on the day of admission.  The patient reportedly found by
police unconscious on her living room floor with multiple
empty bottles of vodka in the house.  The patient was found
hypothermic with a body core temperature of 86 degrees
Fahrenheit and hypoglycemic with a fingerstick blood glucose
brought to [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital where she was found to
have a blood alcohol level of 320 with a persistent
temperature in the mid 80s degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.  In the Emergency Department
at [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was
treated with warming blankets, warm saline infusions, and
warm bladder irrigation, and her body core temperature
subsequently rose to 92 degrees Fahrenheit.  The patient was
initially seen by the Trauma Surgery team, and a subsequent
pelvic x-ray was obtained without evidence of pelvic
fracture.  Initial blood work on admission was notable for a
white blood cell count of 161,000 (with 90% lymphocytes on
white blood cell different).  The patient was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.

The Emergency Room team spoke with the patient's son who
stated that his mother lived alone in squalor.  The patient
reportedly refused Meals-on-Wheels, [**Hospital6 1587**] service, as well as other home services.  The
patient is reportedly ambulatory at baseline.  The son was
not aware of his mother's current alcohol abuse; although, he
reported a vague recollection of previous abuse.

The patient reportedly fell outside her home two weeks prior
to admission (per the patient's son); however, the patient's
son was unaware of her current state of health.  The patient
was reportedly last seen by a neighbor one day prior to
admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history on admission was
unknown; however, based on subsequent conversations with the
patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient has a past
Medical History significant for hypertension and alcohol
abuse.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications were also unknown at
the time of admission; however, subsequent to conversation
with the primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was noted that the
patient was prescribed enalapril 5 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies (per son's recollection).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history, per the patient's son, the
patient is a widower of 10 years.  She lives alone in squalor
with daily alcohol use (later by patient report, one bottle
of gin every three days).  Previous tobacco use of one pack
per three to four days, and no intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
on admission revealed vital signs (in the Intensive Care
Unit) with a temperature of 98.6 (previously 86 degrees
Fahrenheit in the field), blood pressure was 112/46, heart
rate was 108, respiratory rate was 16, oxygen saturation was
94% on a 50% nonrebreather.  In general, the patient appeared
somnolent but agitated when aroused.  The patient's speech
was slurred; however, the patient was noted to be following
commands and in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed normocephalic with multiple
contusions on the face.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Sclerae were anicteric.
Extraocular movements unable to fully assess; however, it was
felt the patient did not demonstrate extraocular movements to
the right beyond midline on admission.  Mucous membranes were
dry, edentulous.  The oropharynx was clear without oral
lesions.  Neck examination revealed supple with the absence
of jugular venous distention.  No lymphadenopathy.  The
patient was in a hard collar on admission.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Pulmonary examination
revealed lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly with no
wheezes, rhonchi, or rales.  Abdominal examination revealed
normal active bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  No organomegaly appreciated.  Extremities
revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibialis pulses were 1 to 2+ bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was noted to be
somnolent but arousable with physical stimuli and oriented to
name only; no gross motor or sensory deficits were noted on
examination.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on
admission revealed complete blood count with a white blood
cell count of 160,000, hematocrit was 41.2, with a mean cell
volume of 108, and platelets were 108.  White blood cell
differential revealed 8% neutrophils, 0% bands,
90% lymphocytes, 1% monocytes.  Smear was notable for
multiple smudge cells.  Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 147,
potassium was 3.1, chloride was 114, bicarbonate was 18,
blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 0.5, and blood
glucose was 16, with an anion gap of 15.  PT was 14.9, with
an INR of 1.5, PTT was 28.3.  Liver function tests revealed
AST was 39, ALT was 13, total bilirubin was 0.5, and LDH was
236.  Calcium was 6.9, phosphate was 2.7, magnesium was 1.3.
Fibrinogen was 258.  Alcohol level on admission to [**Hospital1 **] was 253.  Initial cardiac enzymes revealed
creatine kinase was 162, CK/MB was 6, and troponin was less
than 0.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  On admission, a trauma pelvic film with
no signs of fracture.

A chest x-ray on admission was notable for borderline
congestive heart failure with no pulmonary infiltrates.

Electrocardiogram on admission revealed a normal sinus rhythm
with no ST-T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit where the patient's core body
temperature normalized with continuous warming measures
without noted cardiac complications.

An arterial line and central venous access (left subclavian)
were placed for close monitoring and rapid treatment.  The
patient's hypothermia on admission was of unclear etiology
with a differential diagnosis including hypothyroidism,
sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, alcohol intoxication,
hypoglycemia, as well as insulin overdose.

While the etiology was not clear on admission, these
processes were considered throughout the remainder of the
hospitalization with regard to workup.  The remainder of the
hospital course by systems, included:

1.  HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY SYSTEM:  The initial laboratory work
on admission was notable for a profound monoclonal
lymphocytosis with a white blood cell count of 160,000 and
90% monoclonal lymphocytes.

The Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic was consulted and suggested
chronic lymphocytic leukemia as the most probable diagnosis
based on smudge cells found on peripheral blood smear, the
absence of bands on white blood cell differential, and the
absence of obvious lymphadenopathy.  However,
Hematology/Oncology could not rule out other etiologies; and
blood work was sent for cytology and cytogenetic studies.

Staging abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic CAT scans were
remarkable only for small mediastinal and retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy without evidence of organomegaly (including
liver and spleen).  On the day of discharge, both cytology
and cytogenetic laboratory studies were pending.

The patient was noted to have a macrocytic anemia during the
hospitalization with an initial hematocrit of 41, with a mean
cell volume of 108; which, following intravenous fluid
repletion, subsequently decreased to a hematocrit ranging
from 29 to 31.  The patient's macrocytic anemia was felt to
likely be multifactorial due to most likely to nutritional
deficiencies, alcohol abuse, as well as potential primary
bone marrow processes.  A subsequent vit
