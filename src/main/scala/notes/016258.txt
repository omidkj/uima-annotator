Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6701**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
48 y/o AAF w/ spina bifida, MR, paraperesis, and urostomy p/w
intense crampy abdominal pain and nausea w/ NBNB vomiting that
started this morning. She states she feels her abdomen has been
distended for an uncertain amount of time. She is also
complaining of bilateral buttock pain and feels she has "cuts"
on her buttocks. She is a poor historian given mental
retardation. She denies fevers, chills, chest discomfort or
difficulty breathing.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted for abdominal pain that
presented similarly and had a negative work up including CT
abdomen, RUQ U/S and HIDA scan. She was treated w/a an
aggressive bowel regimen and discharged after having daily
stools.
.
In the ED VS: 97.1 70 104/63 16 98% RA. Exam was notable for
distended abdomen that was diffusely tender to palpation and
tenderness over her bilateral buttock ulcers, which did not
appear infected but center having some necrotic tissue, per ED.
U/A showed evidence of infection. As patient is allergic to
zosyn, quinolones, ceftriaxone, flagyl and bactrim, she was
treated with macrobid in the ED, and also given morphine and
zosyn for her pain and nausea. CT abd/pelvis in the ED showed
moderate bilateral hydronephrosis, with diffuse bilateral
hydroureters all the way to the ileual conduit which was
concerning for distal obstruction. Urology was consulted and
evaluated pt in ED. They felt that since the pt had normal renal
function, surgical intervention was not urgent and they would
continue to follow her on the floor.
.
On the floor, pt is lying on her side complaining of pain, worse
in her buttocks but also diffusely over her abdomen which she
complains is distended.
.
All other ROS negative except as above.

Physical Exam:

.
GEN: obese AAF in mod distress [**3-4**] pain, lying on L side
HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA no scleral icterus
CV: RRR nl S1 S2
LUNGS: CTAB/L
ABD: +BS soft but distended, diffusely TTP all over abd
EXT: warm, well perfused 2+ distal pulses b/l
NEURO: A&Ox3, able to answer questions appropriately
SKIN: large area of skin breakdown and ulceration almost
covering the entirity of buttocks worse on the right than left
buttock, skin breakdown revealing pink granulation tissue w/
some central greyish-white necrosis but no obvious drainage or
purulence, surrounding skin is not erythematous but is
exquisitely TTP


Pertinent Results:
CT AB/Pelvis with contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of mild hydronephrosis and moderate
hydroureter
bilaterally with ureteral dilatation extending to the ileal
conduit which is mildly distended compared to prior studies.
Clinical correlation is
recommended to exclude a possible distal obstruction of the
urostomy,
resulting in upstream dilatation of the collecting systems due
to reflux and back pressure. No mechanical obstruction of the
urostomy on this CT, however, is identified.
2. Unchanged bilateral renal cortical thinning, compatible with
scarring from prior infectious or ischemic insults.
3. No intra-abdominal abscess.
4. Fibroid uterus.
5. Spina bifida with meningocele.

Skin, right posterior shoulder, biopsy (A-B): [**2177-10-13**] 1.
Subepidermal bulla with superficial dermal edema and mixed
neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and lymphocytic infiltrate (see
note).   2.  Neutrophilic folliculitis. Note:  Neutrophilic
microabscesses are present in the superficial epidermis and
within a follicle.  No bacteria or fungi are seen on Gram and
PAS stained sections, however the involved follicle is not
present on these section.  No interface dermatitis to suggest a
fixed drug reaction is seen.  The changes most suggest a bullous
hypersensitivity reaction.  The neutrophilic microabscesses may
represent a feature of this reaction, however focal
superinfection cannot be excluded.  While clinically less
likely, the histologic differential diagnosis includes an
immunobullous disorder .
