Brief Hospital Course:
Bradycardia / Hypotension - Likely related to bradycardia with
possible contribution from volume depletion. No evidence by labs
or exam for infectious etiology.  Patient was on dilt 360mg po
daily and Toprol 100mg po daily.  His EKG showed marked sinus
bradycardia with a rate in the 20s and a junctional escape
rhythm with a rate in the high 50s.  He was hypotensive and
fluid resuscitated, his hypotension resolved and his rhythm
returned to sinus.  His medications were adjusted to Toprol 50mg
daily.  Diltiazem was discontinued.  EP was consulted and helped
direct the plan.  The patient's primary cardiologist was
notified of the changes.

Diabetes - blood glucoses well controlled as inpatient.

ESRD- on HD, rec'd HD as inpatient on Saturday [**9-26**].

Hep C - no active issues. Outpatient follow up.
