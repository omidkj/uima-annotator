Chief Complaint:
multifocal bacterial pneumonia; probable viral illness

bronchoscopy

mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
20 yo female [**University/College 86794**] student presents with
multifocal pneumonia.  Pt states that she was in USOGH until
Sunday [**3-30**], when she began to develop shaking chills, mild
myalgias, sweats, and headache.  The following day, developed a
cough as well, which progressively worsened through the next
several days and became productive of yellow-green sputum.  Her
fevers continued to progress, and presented to the ED and was
found to have a fever of 105.4. She was started on Tamiflu, and
Levofloxacin (first dose 3/17 at 2am).  Pt was taking tylenol,
aspirin, and ibuprofen, but contin to spike fevers to >104.  She
has had a couple of post-tussive emesis, but denies nausea; only
abd discomfort d/t muscular strain from cough.
.
In the ED today, pt had a fever of 104.2, was tachycardic to
134.  Her respiratory status remained stable with RR 19-25 and
95% 2L NC.  IN [**Name (NI) **], pt given 2 L NS and Levofloxacin 750 mg IV.
Nasal swab for influenza was negative, but pt had been on
Tamiflu >24 hrs.  CXR yesterday showed small retrocardiac
pneumonia, but per discussion with Radiology, today's CXR is
much worse with LLL white-out and bronchograms, and RUL and RLL
involvement as well.
.
Pt admitted to Medicine for ongoing management and evaluation.

CXR [**4-3**] (per conversation with Radiology):
Multifocal pneumonia, with dramatic worsening since yesterday.
Worst in LLL, with near white-out and air bronchograms, as well
as areas in RLL and RUL.  No LAD, no pleural effusion.  Official
read pending.

CXR [**4-2**]:
CHEST, FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS: Dense retrocardiac
consolidation is
concerning for pneumonia of the superior segment of the left
lower lobe. The right lung is clear. Heart size is normal.
Leftward mediastinal shift may be due to scoliosis.
Increased density of the left hilus may be due to the pneumonia;
however, a follow-up chest radiograph in 6 weeks is recommended
to ensure resolution of these findings.

[**2110-4-3**] Influenza A/B by DFA DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN
TEST-Neg; DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST-Neg INPATIENT

CT CHEST [**4-3**]:
1. Severe bilateral pneumonia affecting the left lung to a
greater degree
than the right, with an associated moderate left parapneumonic
effusion. There are no CT findings to suggest an empyema, but
correlation with thoracentesis may be helpful if this diagnosis
is being entertained clinically.

2. Enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, consistent with
hyperplastic nodes in the setting of a severe pneumonia.

LOWER EXTREMITY NON-INVASIVE [**4-9**]
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis.

CT CHEST [**4-9**]
1. Interval increase in the degree of patchy and ground-glass
opacities noted throughout the lungs, now extending into
portions of previously spared lung.  Also noted are increasing
bilateral pleural effusions. Given these findings, progressive
pneumonia versus other etiologies such as ARDS are not entirely
excluded.

2. Bilateral consolidative opacities at the lung bases, slightly
improved at the left lung base, consistent with the known
multifocal pneumonia.

3. No abnormality identified within the abdomen or pelvis.

CXR [**4-14**]:
Compared to the prior study, there is slight improvement in the
left basal
aeration with still present significant left retrocardiac
consolidation most likely consistent with atelectasis with
potential superimposed infection and small pleural effusion. No
evidence of pneumothorax is present in this supine radiograph,
but repeated examination with upright radiograph is recommended
to exclude the possibility of subtle pneumothorax given the
history of pleural tapping. Right basal opacity is unchanged.
Mild fluid overload is present.

Overall, there is significant improvement when compared to [**4-9**] and [**2110-4-10**].

Brief Hospital Course:
20 yo female college student presents with multifocal pneumonia,
with signif white-out of LLL, and also with involvement of RLL
and RUL, without pleural effusions, despite levofloxacin which
was started approx 36 hours prior to admission.  Suspect pt may
have had a viral infection with superimposed bacterial
pneumonia.

# hypoxic respiratory failure.  On arrival patient required a
non rebreather to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.  She
became progressively hypoxic, and tachypneic with RR in the 50s,
with significant respiratory distress.  On [**2110-4-6**], she became
acutely hypoxic with coughing to an SpO2 of the 60s, with a very
slow recovery to an SpO2 in the high .  Patient was electively
intubated for hypoxia, requiring high levels of sedation with
midazolam and fentanyl, and ultimately paralysis with
vecuronium.  Initially, she had oxygen saturations of 80% on
mechanical ventilation.  A CXR demonstrated diffuse interstitial
markings, presumably from pulmonary edema.  She was given 40mg
lasix IV, and put out ~2L and her respiratory status improved.
Her ventilator oxygen concentration was steadily decreased, and
her tidal volumes were decreased and respiratory rate was
increased with the goal of ARDSnet low tidal volume ventilation.
Over the following days, her FiO2 and PEEP were gradually weaned
down. Extubation was delayed for several days secondary to
tongue swelling.  Etiology of the tongue swelling was thought to
be positional vs. allergic. Her airway was evaluated on [**4-12**] by
bronchoscopy and found to be patent. Allergy was consulted and
could not find a clear cause for allergy on her med list. Her
tongue swelling resolved with a three day course of IV steroids,
and she was successfully extubated on [**4-13**].  She had initial
difficulty with swallowing but was evaluated by speech & swallow
therapy, who fe
