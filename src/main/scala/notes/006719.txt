Neuro: awake, alert oriented

Pertinent Results:
CXR:
[**2148-8-26**]  One of the patient's right-sided chest tubes has been
removed,
with no visible pneumothorax. With the exception of tube removal
and slight improved aeration at the right lung base, there are
noCultura data (organism and susceptibilities)
[**2148-8-20**]: The postoperative changes have not substantially
changed. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Currently,
there is no evidence of pneumothorax but a small pleural air
inclusion at the right aspects of the lateral chest wall has
slightly decreased in extent.
[**2148-8-19**]: Severe right lower lobe atelectasis and left lower
lobe collapse
with concurrent loculated pleural effusions. Interval
improvement of a small area of radiopacity lateral to the aortic
knob is resolving atelectasis, or less likely pneumonia.
[**2148-8-17**]: The right chest tubes have been removed in the
interim. There is no interval development of pneumothorax.
Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, at least partially
loculated, not increased on neither right nor left side. Bibasal
consolidations are unchanged as well as there is no change in
the mediastinal appearance.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2148-8-20**]
1. Interval decrease in the now small air and fluid collection
in
the right pleural space with a thickened enhancing pleura
consistent with empyema. New adjacent ground-glass parenchymal
opacity could represent infection.
2. Unchanged left small nonhemorrhagic effusion with associated
pleural thickening and enhancement.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 40834**] was admitted [**2148-8-14**] following Right video-assisted
thoracoscopic decortication.  She was transferred to the PACU
intubated overnight to maintain positive pressure for lung
expansion.  She was successfully extubated the next morning to
nasal cannula 3 Liters with oxygen saturations of 93-96%.  She
transferred to the floor in stable condition with oxygen
saturations of 98% on 3L NC. She was transferred to the ICU for
acute mental status change in setting of infection.
Thoracentesis on [**2148-8-20**] demonstrated empyema. She was then
taken back to the OR for right thoracotomy decortication on
[**2148-8-21**]. She transfer to the SICU intubated, 3 chest tubes, a
Foley and IV pain medication. She was successfully extubated
[**2148-8-23**] and titrated to 3 L NC

Neuro: After being extubated in PACU and transfer to floor on
[**2148-8-15**] she was mentation well until [**2148-8-17**] when she became
acutely confused requiring restraints, Haldol and Ativan to calm
down. This was in the setting of a fever and leukocytosis of 21.
Antibiotics were started. She was transferred to the ICU. Home
psych meds  were restart, clomipramine and nefazodone.
Psychiatry was consulted and recommended discontinuing her
Klonopin and continuing clomipramine and nefazodone.  Her mental
status improved.

CV: She was hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm 80-90's on
Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], throughout this admission.  Blood pressure
100-135.

Resp: After extubation, aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs,
ambulation she titrated to her home oxygen requirement of 3L NC
with saturations 91-95%.

Chest tubes: The anterior chest tube was removed and her
posterior and basilar chest tubes were placed to pneumostat
which will slowly be removed over the next few weeks.

GI: After initial decortication on [**2148-8-14**] her diet was advance
without issue. While intubated a Dobbhoff tube was placed
temporarily for medications and feeding. It was removed [**2148-8-26**]
following negative bedside swallow evaluation. Her diet was
advanced without further issue.

GU: She initially had urinary retention problems requiring
replacement of Foley catheter but was voiding well at time of
discharge.

Heme: Her HCT was noted to drop from 27 to 23 and she was
concurrently tachycardic. She was transfused 1 unit of PRBC on
[**2148-8-17**]. She was transfused 2 more units of PRBC on [**2148-8-22**] and
her HCT stabilized at 25-26.

ID: She was empirically started on Vancomycin and Zosyn on
[**2148-8-18**] in the setting of rising WBC and acute confusion. Her
WBC count went from 6.5 to 21.7 from [**8-17**] to [**8-18**] and her Tmax
was 102.4. Her blood cultures were negative. The pleural fluid,
tissue, and chest tube site grew MRSA. Infectious disease was
consulted and recommended Vancomycin 750 mg Q12H for 4 weeks.
Weekly CBC w/diff, BUN/CRE and Vanco trough on discharge.  She
will follow with infectious disease as an outpatient.

PICC line: Right Brachial 46 cm terminated in the mid SVC was
placed on [**2148-8-26**].

FEN: Nutrition evaluated the patient during this hospital stay
and recommended diet supplementation to increase calorie and
protein intake.

Pain: IV opioids were transition to PO Hydromorphone 2-4 mg with
good results.

Dispos: Physical therapy recommended rehab.  She was discharged
to [**Hospital1 700**] in [**Location (un) 701**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 40835**] (Fax:
