CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old
woman admitted to the medical intensive care unit with a past
medical history significant for chronic pain syndrome,
reflexive sympathetic dystrophy on high-dose narcotics at
home with depression, bipolar disorder, multiple psychiatric
hospitalizations, with intentional overdose suicide attempt x
1 in the early [**2148**].  She was transferred from an outside
hospital for hypercarbic respiratory failure of unknown
etiology.  According to her family the patient was told she
might lose her vision in one eye and had become increasingly
depressed over the past week.  She just sits in front of the
television.  The patient was noted to be soundly sleeping one
day prior to admission.  She was not arousable at that point
and then her family brought her to [**Hospital3 **] on Friday.
The patient has had a chronic cough and decreased p.o.
intake.  She has had weight loss, three to four days of
flu-like symptoms but she denies fever, chills or shortness
of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic pain syndrome, Meniere's
disease, status post right craniotomy, internal auditory
region surgery in [**2160**], bilateral occipital neuralgias,
cerebral aneurysm repair with a PICA repair, adrenal
insufficiency, hydrocephalus status post ventriculoperitoneal
shunt with a recurrent shunting needed, right weakness and
facial droop, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
depression, suicide attempt x 1, B12 deficiency, migraines
and reflexive sympathetic dystrophy.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Synthroid 200 mcg q.d.; Zofran 8 mg q.
12 p.r.n.; Neurontin 2,400 mg once; desipramine 75 mg q.h.s.;
MS Contin 100 mg q. 6 hours p.r.n.; OxyContin 80 mg q. 8
p.r.n.; ................... 200 mg twice a day;
................... 4 two tablets q. 6 hours; Effexor 37 mg;
and vitamin B12.

ALLERGIES:  Intravenous morphine, Tegretol and sulfa.  Sulfa
leads to anaphylaxis.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  On admission her white count was 9.8,
hematocrit 38.7, platelet count 172, INR 2.4.  She had a
sodium of 146, potassium 3.4, chloride 111, bicarbonate 23,
BUN 66, creatinine 1.6, glucose 96, ALT 395, AST 445,
alkaline phosphatase 176, total bilirubin 0.7, troponin 13.7,
MB 23 and index of 2, LDH was 681, CK 1,178.  Arterial blood
gases were 7.25, 53, 116.  Urine had trace ketones, large
blood, 100 protein, small leukocyte esterase, high nitrite,
15-20 white cells, trace bacteria.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 100, normal axis, T wave
inversions in 3 and V1, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in 2, 3, F, V5,
V6, ST segment was raised in V1 and V2, borderline left
ventricular hypertrophy, good R wave progression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Cardiovascular:  The patient was
diagnosed with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.  She
was treated with 48 hours of heparin, followed on telemetry
and CK and troponin leak resolved on its own.  The patient
had no issues on telemetry and was treated with aspirin 325,
metoprolol 25, lisinopril 2.5.  The patient had no other
cardiac issues during the hospitalization.

2. Gastrointestinal:  The patient had increased ALT, AST and
alkaline phosphatase.  The patient was diagnosed with shock
liver.  Those liver function tests resolved to normal on
their own which is consistent with shock liver.  The patient
received no further treatment for that.

3. Pulmonary:  The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia
believed to be a complicated pneumonia.  She will be treated
with a total of a two-week dose of levofloxacin, which will
be discontinued on the 25th.  The patient is now saturating
comfortably on room air.

4. Renal:  The patient was diagnosed with acute renal failure
with BUN to creatinine of 66/2.9.  The patient was treated
with intravenous hydration and the patient's BUN and
creatinine returned to [**Location 213**].  The patient's most recent BUN
to creatinine is 7/0.5.

5. Neurologic:  The patient was found to have waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status without evidence of an acute infarct.
The patient's condition was discussed with the neurology team
and they recommended risperidone 0.5 mg at 5 PM and q.h.s.
p.r.n.  The patient has a PICA clip from [**2164**] that we could
not get the make up of, so the patient did not have an
magnetic resonance imaging scan as unlikely there was an
acute finding.  The patient's field cut is likely secondary
to already known Meniere's and reflexive sympathetic
dystrophy that is leading to her chronic pain syndrome.

6. Endocrine:  The patient was treated with Synthroid 200 mcg
p.o. q.d.  The patient needs thyroid function tests followed
up in three weeks.

7. Pain:  The patient was treated with a fentanyl patch.  The
patient had a 150 mcg patch q. three days.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Complicated pneumonia.
2. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Albuterol 1-2 puffs inhaled q. 6 hours p.r.n.
2. Albuterol nebulizer, one nebulizer q. 6 hours p.r.n.
3. Atrovent 2 puffs inhaled q. 6 hours.
4. Fentanyl patch 150 mcg per hour q. 72 hours.
5. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. 24 hours.
