Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 79M history of advanced Parkinson's disease, severe
restrictive lung disease secondary to scoliosis, COPD, recurrent
aspiration, who seen here yesterday for concerned about G-tube
function, and Gastrografin study showed the tube was patent and
in the appropriate position without extravasation of contrast
and then went back to his [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 731**]. While he was given
tube feeds today at his NH, he coughed and then vomited his tube
feeds. His g-tube was suctioned and then feeds were resumed and
he vomited again. He then developed increased cough, increased
oxygen requirement, and significant upper airway secretion
sounds. He has been having shortness of breath and was sent in
for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were:  97.5 74 114/70 24 96% 5L. On exam
he was tachypneic, gurgling secretions, abd non-tender, guiaic
neg, appeared to be in respiratory distress. CXR showed severe
left hemidiaphragmatic elevation, decreased airation of left
upper lobe compared to prior, right lung clear. He was suctioned
and given albuterol nebs, ipratropium nebs, pip-tazo, vanco,
morphine 2 mg iv x2, and glycopyrolate for his secretions. He
was placed on Bipap and his tachypnea improved. His most recent
VS prior to transfer were P 110 BP 125/93 RR: 25 O2 100% BiPAP
[**1-9**] on 100% Fi02
.
On the floor, patient says 'yes' that his breathing is better
and that he is feeling. He agrees that he would want intubation
but not CPR.

CXR [**2169-1-20**]:
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest is
obtained. As seen on the prior examination, there is severe
elevation of the left diaphragm with stomach/bowel seen
projecting over the left hemithorax. Compared to the prior
study, there is decrease in aeration of the left upper lung,
with now no aeration seen, and the visualized left hemithorax
opacified; complete opacification of the previously aerated apex
of the left lung could be due to pleural effusion, aspiration,
pneumonia, or atelectasis. The visualized right lung appears
clear. No right pleural effusion is seen. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is largely obscured. High riding bilateral humeral
heads may be due to rotator cuff disease.

IMPRESSION: Again severe left hemidiaphragm elevation seen in
the left
hemithorax. Previously small amount of aerated left apex is no
longer seen, but now opacified, could be due to increased
atelectasis, aspiration, pneumonia, and/or pleural effusion.

CT Chest [**2169-1-21**]
1. Moderate left hydropneumothorax. Due to the severe left
hemidiaphragm
elevation, the best location for a chest tube would be the
anterior second and third interspace.
2. Right upper lobe pneumonia.
3. Stable appearance of an indeterminate left renal lesion since
[**2165**], which could be further characterized with MRI if
clinically indicated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a 79M with history of advanced Parkinson's disease,
severe restrictive lung disease secondary to scoliosis and
chronically elevated left hemidiaphragm, COPD, recurrent
aspiration with G-tube in place who presented to the ED from his
NH after developing respiratory distress after vomiting tube
feeds and found to have aspiration pneumonia and
hydropneumothoraz. DNR/DNI status was confirmed and patient and
his nephew declined surgery. His goals of care were changed to
comfort measures only. He passed away on [**1-23**] at 1:25 pm from
respiratory failure.
