History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 66 y.o female with h.o COPD, PE, OSA, GIB, HTN, DM, CHF,
anemia who presents from [**Hospital **] Hospital with SOB.
Per report, pt had known PE, COPD, PNA and was at Rehab for that
condition.
 However, she worsened (increasing difficulty maintaining sats
and c/o abdominal pain). Per report, pt uses bipap at night and
was noted to have decreased breath sounds on the L.side. She
reported dyspnea with speaking. Therefore, she was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for eval.
Pt was most recently hospitalized at [**Hospital3 417**] and
discharged on levoquin for CAP. At rehab, abx were broadened to
vanco and cefepime and course was completed yesterday per pt's
daughter.
.
In the emergency department, initial vitals were:
Time Pain Temp HR BP RR Pox
10:47 0 97.5 100 120/78 24 98 (nonreb)
last vitals HR 102, BP 118/71, on PS RR 14, PEEP 5, PSV 8, FIO2
50%, sat 90%.
access-PIV and PICC
Given respiratory distress, hypoxia to 74% on RA, 91% on 6L, pt
was trialed on bipap (with no response) and was intubated. Per
[**Name (NI) **], pt on "several liters of o2" at baseline, on bipap at night
and intermittently during the day. ED concerned re: mental
status and without improvement pt was intubated with 7.5 tube.
Given CT findings,
of LLL collapse with occlusion of L.main stem bronchus, and
possible LUL PNA, IP was made aware of pt. Pt also reported
vague upper abdominal pain and was given vanco and zosyn. She
was "shaking", but not localizing nor febrile.
.
.
.
See MICU admit note for complete details, breifly, 66F with h/o
severe COPD (4L O2 @ home, baseline sats high 80s), OSA (bipap
20/5), with chronic cough, and dyspnea since [**1-3**].  She was
treated at OSH with levaquin, and trasferred to rehab, where she
was ultimately started on vancomycin/cefepime by report, but
continued to worsen with regard to her respiratory status,
prompting referral to [**Hospital1 18**], where she was noted to be acutely
hypoxic (74%RA), and intubated in the ED for "airway
proteection"  CT CHEST revealed LLL atalectasis with occlusion
of the left mainstem bronchus.
.
Of note, she was evalauted by IP in the recent past for
?tracheomalacia.
.
In ICU, she was treated with vanc/zosyn.  Bronch performed,
which revealed severe tracehobronchomalacia main distal
tracehea, copious thick secretions left mainstain and segmental
bronchi.  Culture, however, has only shown RSV, although was
done on antibiotics.
.
Admit labs otherwise notable for leukocytosis (14), HCT 30->28,
cre 2.3 (baseline ), HCO3 34, vanco level 15, 7.39/58/81 (last
intubated gas on [**2-23**]).  Her lasix dose was decreased from 120
qam; 80 qpm to 120mg qam given rising creatinine.  She was
otherwise continued on a steroid taper (30mg qdaily -> 20 mg po
qdaily starting [**2-24**], at baseline is maintained on 10mg po
qdaily per daughter).
.
She is being called out to the medical service after having been
transitioned to heparin gtt (on coumadin for afib, h/o PE), in
anticipation of pulmonary stent later this week.
.
At present, she has no specific complaints, and states her
breathing is much improved compared to her baseline (confirmed
per her daughters).

Past Medical History:
trachobronchomalacia-was scheduled for stent in 1 week.

oxygen)

Social History:
Currently at [**Hospital1 **] for rehab
Originally from [**Location (un) 37452**], She currently lives with her 2
daughters and husband and grandson. They have a cat. She is a

Her family history is notable for a daughter with asthma and
father who died of emphysema related working in the coal mines
