Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right-sided thoracentesis
CT-guided biopsy of a lung nodule
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61 year old Hatian-Creole speaking female who
presented on [**2142-11-27**] with shortness of [**Date Range 1440**].  History taken
via interpreter.  The patient reports intermittent SOB over the
past year.  She was admitted for an extended period of time to
[**Hospital 8**] hospital in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year and had an extensive
workup which included the diagnosis of severe dilated
cardiomyopathy.  She reports that she returned from a trip to
[**Country 2045**] approximately three weeks ago.  Immediately following her
return she started experiencing worsening of her shortness of
[**Country 1440**]. She also was experiencing pain in legs bilaterally as
well as lower extremity swelling.  On presentation she endorsed
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea also endorsed a cough
productive of white sputum.  At baseline she is able to walk [**1-23**]
blocks without shortness of [**Month/Day (2) 1440**] but on presentation had
dyspnea with one or two steps.  She also reported an itchy rash
on her chest, back and feet which has only been present "while
she has been sick."  Finally in the ER she was noted to have
"vulvar masses."
.
In the ER she was found to be hypertensive with SBP in the 170s
for which she was started on a nitroglycerin drip.  She also
required BiPAP for two hours.  She received Lasix 40 mg IV x1,
levofloxacin 750 mg IV x1, aspirin 325 mg x1 and Zofran 4 mg IV
x 1.  CXR showed a R. sided pleural effusion and a CT torso
revealed multiple filling defects which were felt to represent
chronic pulmonary emboli and not an acute process.  She was
started on lovenox and transfered to the medicine service.
.
Review of systems: Denies fevers/chills, headache, chest pain or
pressure, and abdominal pain. Has noted a decrease in her
appetite for a while, with some weight loss (unable to
quantify), but recently this is improved. Denies N/V, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR.

Pulmonary nodules on CT of unclear etiology
Valvular disease: 3+ TR, 3+ MR, significant PR
? liver problem diagnosed in [**Country 2045**] (records not available)


Social History:

[**Country 2045**] one year ago and her husband is still there.  She does not

INTERPRETATION:  Non-specific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile;
diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by
non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Correlation with clinical findings is recommended.  Flow
cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas due to
topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
