Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**7-10**] Cardiac catheterization
[**7-15**] Aortic Valve Replacement ([**Street Address(2) 6158**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Epic
Biocor tissue valve), Coronary artery bypass grafting x 1 with
reverse saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41323**] is an 84 year-old woman with history of atrial
fibrillation (not anticoagulated), aortic stenosis, CHF, COPD,
and pulmonary hypertension.  For the past several months she has
been having increasing symptoms of dyspnea on exertion.  In
[**4-30**], she was admitted to [**Hospital3 2737**] with a CHF
exacerbation in the context of an infection (pt unsure of nature
of infection).  She received IV lasix and was discharged on PO
lasix.  Two weeks ago, Ms. [**Known lastname 41323**] [**Last Name (Titles) 46101**] the NP who works
with her cardiologist (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8098**]) who
recommended that she stop lasix given absence of peripheral
edema, and she planned to take it PRN which she has not
required.

Although she was previously able to ambulate through the grocery
store without difficulty, her current baseline respiratory
status is notable for dyspnea on exertion half-way across a room
in her home, causing her to sit down and rest.  She has
previously led a very active lifestyle.  Because her symptoms
were thought to be in large part secondary to her AS and
limiting her ADLs, she was referred for catheterization in
anticipation of possible AVR.  She denies any recent chest pain,
light-headedness, or syncope.  She further denies claudication,
LE edema, orthopnea, or PND.
.
She was taken for cath on [**7-10**] demonstrating an 80% ostial RCA
lesion and valve area 0.5 cm2.  After the case the patient
developed bleeding from groin with hypotension 60s systolic, HR
40s - received fluids and atropine.  After this her SBP rose
into the 130s with HR 70s. She was sent to the CCU for
observation overnight.

Paroxsymal Atrial Fibrillation - She did not know of this
diagnosis.  Denied ever taking Coumadin.

visiting nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 767**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Health Agency for three weeks
after her hospitalization in [**Month (only) **]. Her contact person in her
stepson [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 41323**]; his home number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 55822**]. The

[**2115-7-10**] Cardiac Catheterization: 1. Coronary angiography in this
right dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The LAD and the LCX had no angiographically significant
stenosis.  The RCA had a 90% ostial calcified stenosis, and
supplied small PDA and PL arteries.  The distal RCA before the
crux appears to be a good target for bypass. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed normal right atrial and right ventricular
filling pressures with mean RA pressure of 6 mmHg and
end-diastolic RV pressure of 5 mmHg.  There was mild pulmonary
arterial hypertension with mean PA pressure of 26 mmHg and
elevated pulmonary vascular resistance of 150 dynes-sec/cm5.
The left ventricular filling pressure was slightly elevated with
mean PCW pressure of 17 mmHg.  There was no evidence of mitral
stenosis.  Severe aortic stenosis was present, with a peak
aortic gradient of 66 mmHg, mean gradient of 49 mmHg, and
estimated aortic valve area of 0.59 cm2.  The cardiac output was
normal at 4.8 L/min.  There was no evidence of a left-to-right
shunt based on oxygen saturation data.
[**2115-7-11**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis
<40%
EKG: sinus at 75 bpm, NL axis, 1st degree AV block, no ST-T wave
changes
[**2115-7-15**] ECHO: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no prolapse of flailing [**Last Name (un) **] leaflets. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55823**] was notified in person of the
results on Ms.[**Known lastname 41323**] at 8AM before incision. Post_Bypass:
Patient on infusion of epinephrine 0.04 mcg/kg/min, mild RV and
global LV hypokinesis. LVEF 45%. There is a bioprosthesis in the
native aortic position with stable and well functioning
leaflets. Thoracic aorta is intact. There is minimal MR.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 41323**] is an 84 year-old woman with aortic stenosis,
recent admission to outside hospital for CHF/flash pulmonary
edema with subsequent ongoing shortness of breath, now s/p
catheterization on [**7-10**] demonstrating 90% ostial RCA lesion and
[**Location (un) 109**] 0.
