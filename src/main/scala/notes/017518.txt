Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension and neutropenic fever

Bone marrow biopsy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 467**] is a 71 yo M with a h/o PMR, C. diff colitis, +PPD
treated with INH, and AML s/p allogenic SCT [**6-14**] with relapse
treated w/ decitabine now s/p donor lymphocyte infusion on [**11-10**]
who developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea shortly thereafter.
 He began having nausea and vomiting on the evening of [**11-14**]
shortly after returning to [**State 531**].  He received chemotherapy
(decitabine) from his oncologist in NY on [**11-15**].  He then
developed diarrhea and a bright macular papular rash on the
trunk extending to the feet on [**11-18**] and was admitted to an OSH
on [**11-19**] and is now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with  pancytopenia and
suspicion of GVHD vs. C. diff colitis or other infection.



He presented to an OSH on [**11-19**] nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and a
maculopapular rash. He ran a low grade fever and was found to be
pancytopenic with a WBC 0.4, Hct 29 and plt 27.  He was
initially placed on a low sodium, lactose-free diet with IVF and
received his fifth dose of decitabine on that day.  On the 16th
he spiked a fever in the setting of receiving a transfusion and
was pan-cultured.  TPN was initiated on [**11-21**] due to poor PO
intake.  Per the patient's wife, he spiked a fever to 103 on
this date.  On [**11-22**] he was noted to be hypotensive on the
floor, but responded to bolused IVF with systolics in teh 90s.
There was reportedly also a question of a cavitating mass in his
lung.  After conversations with the BMT fellow on [**11-22**] he was
started on vancomycin, zosyn (they did not have cefepime on
formulary), micafungin, and flagyl (unclear if he received all
of these) and received a unit of platelets and solumedrol 30 mg
IV for presumed GVHD.  En route to [**Hospital1 18**] SBPs ranged from 76 to
122, but were mostly around/above 100 systolic.

.

On arrival in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient appeared tired and was
occasionally dry heaving.  He reported some intermittant
lightheadedness earlier in the day as well as some lower
abdominal pain in a band like pattern similar to his prior C.
diff abdominal pain that had since passed.




Past Medical History:
# ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:

- [**4-/2142**]: note to have a mild leukopenia (WBC 3.9 with mild
lymphocytosis) with a normal hemoglobin, hematocrit, and
platelets

- [**6-/2144**]: pancytopenic

- [**8-/2144**]: bone marrow aspirate consistent with myelodysplastic
syndrome and FISH revealed trisomy 8, blasts were approximately
20%.

- [**9-/2144**]: began monthly azacitidine therapy, until [**6-/2145**]

- [**6-/2145**]: resumed a transfusion requirement, developed severe
bone pain and worsening fatigue. He was admitted on [**2145-6-21**] when
he was noted to have circulating blasts. Repeat marrow was
consistent with AML and began therapy with 7+3 on [**2145-6-23**]. His
post induction course was complicated by C. diff. His day 14
bone marrow was hypocellular and consistent with
chemotherapeutic effect. His day 30 bone marrow biopsy was
mildly hypercellular, erythroid dominant and without definite
morphologic evidence of leukemia.

fludarabine, busulfan, and ATG as his conditioning

Imaging:
KUB [**11-23**]: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with inadequate views
to assess for free air or air-fluid levels. Correlation with
chest radiograph for
evaluation for subdiaphragmatic free air is recommended. If
additional
evaluation for free air or air-fluid levels is clinically
indicated, then
upright view of the abdomen is recommended. No evidence for
obstruction or
colitis.

CXR [**11-23**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung
volumes have
slightly decreased. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the
upper range of normal. There is mild to moderate pulmonary
edema. Retrocardiac
atelectasis. No evidence of pleural effusions. No focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. No cavitary lung
lesions.
