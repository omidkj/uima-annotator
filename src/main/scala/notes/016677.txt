CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2120-8-25**].

Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from [**2120-8-14**] as
well as a
prior CTA chest from [**2120-8-15**].
CLINICAL HISTORY: Shortness of breath. Question pneumonia.
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.
Patient is rotated
to her right, which limits evaluation. Coarsened interstitial
markings are
again noted and may reflect underlying scarring, better assessed
on prior CT.
Areas of traction bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe likely
accounts for
the increased opacity seen in the right medial cardiophrenic
recess. Lungs
are hyperinflated. There is no definite evidence of pneumonia or
overt CHF.
No large pleural effusions are seen. Calcification of the
tracheobronchial
tree is noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is
no
pneumothorax. Bones are diffusely demineralized. Degenerative
changes are
noted in the thoracic spine with kyphosis.
IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of pneumonia. Chronic changes
as described.

[**2120-8-25**] Wet read CT of chest: No PE, dissection or aneurysm.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with acute on chronic diastolic
heart failure. She presented to the emergency department with an
episode of shortness of breath after taking an entire bottle of
mag-citrate. During her admission she was diuresed with IV
lasix. Her shortness of breath improved to her baseline. She was
found on CT to have a stricture in the ascending colon. She is
scheduled for surgery on [**8-31**].
.
#CAD: Patient has a history of CHF. She had an NSTEMI/demand
ischemia event a few weeks ago in the setting of a GI bleed and
bowel prep. During the hospitalization she was continued on
aspirin, atorvastatin, and a beta-blocker. She had a slightly
elevated troponin which was likely residual from her previous
event.
.
#CHF: Patient was volume overloaded in the ED. We diuresed her
with several doses of IV furosemide. Her breathing and clinical
exam greatly improved. Patient was able to ambulate in the halls
without oxygen. We continued lisinopril throughout the hospital
stay. An echocardiogram showed an EF of > 55% with severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
#HTN: She presented to the ED hypertensive and was noted to have
labile blood pressure per clinic records. We switched her from
metoprolol to labetalol which was her previous home medication.
This resulted in improved BP control.
.
#AF: She had a history of atrial fibrillation. When she
presented, she was in sinus. During the hospitalization, her
rate became irregular with bigeminy and rapid ventricular
response. She was not anticoagulated given her recent episode of
bleeding. We continued her beta-blocker and amiodarone.
.
# GI: During the patient's recent hospitalization she was unable
to complete the  bowel prep because of her NSTEMI/demand
ischemia. Her abdominal symptoms of bloating, cramping,
distention, and constipation worsened throughout this hospital
stay cosistent with a high grade partial obstruction. A CT scan
of the abdomen and pelvis showed a stricture in the ascending
colon. Both GI and surgery were asked to consult. She was
scheduled for surgery on [**8-30**].
______________________________
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 16490**] was taken to surgery on [**2120-8-31**] and underwent an
extended R colectomy. The operation itself went well.
Postoperatively, she was oliguric and hypotensive. She was
evaluated for MI and her EKGs and cardiac enzymes were
reassuring. On exam, she had no signs of heart failure and did
respond to IV fluids. On POD#1, her urine output increased but
her blood pressure remained low. She was transferred to the
VICU, and then to the SICU for close monitoring for her
asymptomatic hypotension and rapid heart rate requoring
medications and fluids. Her diet was advanced to clears and then
to regular diet after resumption of bowel function and after her
abdominal exam was reassuring.  Pathology returned
adenocarcinoma  T3 N1 M0 with 1/16 nodes involved.

She remained in the ICU until POD#4. She was transferred to the
floor. On POD#5, she started having small amounts of
hematochezia. She had tachycardia to 110-120s. Her Hct dropped
to 25. INR was elevated to 3.5 despite holding coumadin.   This
was corrected with vit K and FFP.  Over the next 2 days, the
bleeding continued, but at a slower rate, and she was given a
total of 4 units of blood. She was started on PPI and her ASA
was reduced from 325mg to 81mg. The bleeding stopped eventually,
and she had 6 stable Hcts above 30.

She had lower extremity edema which is quite a bit better at the
time of discharge.
She is discharged home with services and PT. She is tolerating a
regular diet though her appetite is somewhat depressed. She will
follow up in office with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her primary care doctor
and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for check-up and skin clip removal.
