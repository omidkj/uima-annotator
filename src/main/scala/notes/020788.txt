IMAGING
CT chest [**4-25**]
1. Mixed changes since prior study, with several areas of
improved ground- glass opacity seen bilaterally, unchanged
donsolidative opacity in the left lower lobe, and increased
consolidation in right lower lobe. Findings are most suggestive
of an acute infection superimposed on a chronic interstitial
fibrotic lung disease. In the absence of infectious symptoms,
acute exacerbation of chronic interstitial pneumonia should also
be considered especially if the patient has experienced
worsening dyspnea in the past month without other contributing
factors.

2. The underlying nature of patient's chronic interstitial
fibrotic lung disease is difficult to assess in the setting of
acute superimposed changes. Given the bronchovascular
involvement and hyperlucent nodules, chronic hypersensitivity
pneumonitis should be considered. Other diagnostic
considerations include usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) and
a fibrotic sybtype of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis
(NSIP).

3. Findings suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension
.
4. Saber-sheath configuration of the trachea, finding often seen
in COPD.

5. Increased gallbladder distention compared to prior study. If
clinically indicated, this could be further evaluated with
ultrasound.
.
CT head [**4-25**]
No CT evidence for acute intracranial process.
.
CTA chest [**4-21**]
1. No pulmonary embolism to proximal subsegmental level. More
distal branches obscured by respiratory motion.

2. Multifocal airspace opacities, predominantly basilar and
peripheral, though some appear to follow airways. This could
represent pneumonia, especially with superimposed dense
consolidation and effusion at the left base. The peripheral
interstitial opacity better seen in the right lung could also
represent an interstitial process such as UIP/IPF.

3. Small left pleural effusion.

4. Coronary artery calcifications.

ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Diastolic function
could not be assessed. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion..


Brief Hospital Course:
78 man with history of bronchiectasis, recent left knee
replacement and treatment for community acquired pneumonia
presents with hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure:
Initially concerns included healthcare acquired pneumonia given
his recent bout with pneumonia one week ago (treatedw ith
ceftriaxone and azithro, unclear if his symptoms really
subsided), PE given his recent knee surgery.  A chest CTA was
done in the ED that did not show PE but did show some fibrotic
process.  He had a CXR in the ED that showed LLL consolidation
and treatment for healthcare acquired pneumonia with vancomycin
and zosyn were started.  His increasing oxygen requirement was
concerning and he was intubated. He met ARDS criteria and ARDS
net vent settings were used.  Initially there was some concern
for acute on chronic congestive heart failure as a cause of his
respiratory distress, diuresis did not improve his symptoms, BNP
was not elevated and echo was unimpressive.  In addition he had
a bronchoscopy and BAL, from which no organsisms were isolated.
Studies looking at Goodpasture, and aspergillus were negative.
A repeat CT chest was done for concern of the fibrotic changes
on his inital CT.  The diagnosis of acute IPF was considered
likely as he had not improved on antibiotics.  Steroids were
started with minimal improvement in his ventilator requirements.
 NAC was also started without effect.
After being intubated for over 7 days, tracheostomy was raised
with his family.  As he stated previously that he would not want
to be m
