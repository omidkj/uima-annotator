Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
76M well known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] who became hypotensive in rehab
and
is now being transferred from [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital for
further management.

Patient was admitted in [**1-21**] for gallstone pancreatitis
complicated by pancreatic necrosis and pseudocyst formation. He
had a prolonged ICU stay, underwent tracheostomy, open GJ-tube
and percutaneous cholecystostomy tube in addition to pigtail
drainage of the pseudocyst during his two-month long admission.
In rehab his perc chole tube fell out and he was subsequently
taken to the OR for open subtotal cholecystectomy with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
drain placed in the gallbladder fossa. Unfortunately, he
developed a wound infection requiring opening of the involved
portion of his incision. Suspicion for a bile leak was confirmed
with percutaneous cholangiography and an internal/external PTC
drain was placed [**4-7**]. Pull-back cholangiogram also demonstrated
a distal CBD stricture. He was ultimately discharged to rehab on
[**5-1**] with the PTC capped and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in the biloma.

On day 2 in rehab the staff noted his SBP to be in the 80's, but
was reportedly asymptomatic during the event. He had no fevers,
chills, nausea, abdominal pain, cough or dysuria. He was sent to
[**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital where he was found to be afebrile with
HR 67 and BP 94/58; he still had no complaint and was mentating
well. WBC there was 17.7 with 13% bands and normal LFTs. Chest
CTA was (-)PE but notable for LLL PNA. He was initiated on
vancomycin & levofloxacin prior to his transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

[**5-7**] CT
Innumerable intra-abdominal and pelvic fluid collections many of
which are contiguous with each other. Some of these collections
have slightly increased in size and the rest are not
significantly changed. Multiple gas pockets are now evident
within some of the collections, now contain pockets of gas
within them, new since the prior study. The significance of this
finding is not clear in the setting of multiple intra-abdominal
drains. However, superinfection of these pancreatic pseudocysts
cannot be excluded.

[**5-7**] CXR
A new left lower lobe opacity obscuring the hemidiaphragm and
part of the left heart border with leftward mediastinal shift is
demonstrated, findings consistent with left lower lobe
atelectasis and is new since a prior study. There is also small
left pleural effusion present most likely unchanged compared to
the prior film. The left upper lung is unremarkable. The
evaluation of right lung demonstrates faint opacity in the right
upper lobe slightly obscuring the upper portion of the right
hilus which might represent atelectasis or developing pneumonia.
A small right pleural effusion is also present.

Multiple catheters projecting over the right upper quadrant are
demonstrated, new since the prior study and their precise
definition is difficult in the absence of clinical history.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to Gold Surgery for management of his
hypotension and possible pneumonia.  The patient was admitted to
the ICU and started on vanc/levo.  The patient had an uneventful
ICU course and was transferred to the floor on HD 2.  We held
the patient's lisinopril and atenolol for hypotension, and the
patient was normotensive throughout the hospital course.  On
[**5-7**], the PTC drain was capped without complications or acute
events.  Upon discharge, the patient is afebrile with all vitals
stable, tolerating po feeds, ambulating, and with pain
controlled.  The patient will be discharged off of his atenolol
and lisinopril with instruction to follow up with PCP to
cautiously restart his BP meds.
