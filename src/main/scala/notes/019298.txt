ADDENDUM:  Because of the concern with the patient's
inability to ambulate, both extremities, and history of COPD,
Pulmonary Medicine was consulted.  Because the chest x-ray
showed mild CHF, no history of echocardiogram done in the
past, this was done on [**2201-2-13**].  The study showed
that the left atrium was elongated, right atrium moderately
dilated.  There was a moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.  Overall, left ventricular systolic function was
normal, LVEF more than 55%, right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion were normal.  The aortic valve leaflets
were mildly thickened and mild 1+ aortic regurgitation was
seen.  The mitral valve appeared normal with a trivial mitral
regurgitation.  The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure was also normal and there was no pericardial
effusion.

The opinion of Pulmonary Medicine was that the patient has
probable mixed restrictive/obstructive lung disease, meaning
a combination of asthma and obesity.  ABGs showed mild
hypercarbia.  There were no pulmonary contraindications to
discharge.

Spirometry was done and again Pulmonary Medicine were
satisfied with the results.  The FEV1 was 0.84, FVC 1.15,
probably underestimated.  Other conditions were the
continuing of incentive spirometry.  Transfer from bed to
chair as often as feasible for several hours every day.
Also, continue DVT prophylaxis as long as the patient is
immobile as was suggested earlier by Orthopedic Surgery.

The patient's MDI technique is very poor and she needs to use
a spacer while using her inhalers.  Serevent was started with
a spacer and it was recommended to stop the patient's Flonase
that she uses at home.  If MDI technique is still poor, the
patient needs to have nebulizer treatments.

The patient needs to follow-up with her primary pulmonologist
a few weeks after discharge before other planned operative
intervention.

UPDATED LIST OF MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lovenox 30 mg subcutaneously q. 12 hours times six weeks,
started on [**2201-1-31**].
2.  Oxycontin 20 mg subcutaneously b.i.d.
3.  Docusate sodium 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Keflex 500 mg p.o. q. eight hours times ten days, started
on [**2201-2-9**].
5.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. 24 hours.
6.  Solu-Medrol two puffs IH b.i.d. via spacer.
7.  Flonase two puffs per nostril q.d.  The patient is using
her own medication.
8.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n.
9.  Ipratropium bromide two puffs IH q. 4-6 hours p.r.n. up
to 12 puffs per day.

Again, the patient needs to continue to be nonweightbearing.
She needs to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in two to three
weeks at [**Hospital1 18**], phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 33838**].
