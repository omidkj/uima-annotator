Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation (OSH)

History of Present Illness:
43 yo female with h/o bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who
was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for respiratory failure.
Per boyfriend, pt had been very awake for 4-5 days. Yesterday
AM, he was unable to arouse her from sleep and she was still
sleeping on return from work. This AM, he still was unable to
rouse her and noted urinary incontinence, so he called EMS. No
observed tonic clonic movements or bowel incontinence; no h/o
seizure d/o. He was concerned for overdose given some
unidentified, empty pill bottles found near her, h/o overdose
8-9 years ago , and recent multiple stressors including ongoing
psych med adjustments, recent cholecystectomy, and strained
relationship with parents although.
.
In the OSH [**Name (NI) **], pt had a RR of 6 and was desatting to 70-80s on
arrival. Urine tox positive for benzos and methadone. Pt
received Narcan. She developed hypoxemic respiratory failure
with ABG 7.525/33.4/46 requiring intubation. CT torso showed
left lung consolidation with volume loss and distal left
mainstem bronchus narrowing. She was given Zosyn and K 40-60 mEq
for hypokalemia and transferred here for further evaluation.
.
In our ED, initial vs were: T 98 rectal, HR 105 with PVCs, BP
120/60, RR 30, O2sats in low 90s. Pt sedated with propofol on
arrival but overbreathing vent. She was suctioned with
improvement in O2sat to 100% on AC 500/16/6/100%. Labs notable
for WBC of 17.9 with 91.6%N. Read here of OSH CT chest noted
mediastinal shift to the left with left lung atelectasis;
hypodense material in the airways, mostly at the left lung base;
and pericardial effusion. Pt was given a dose of vancomycin IV.
She also received 1L NS IV for lactate 3.2 and 40m Eq K for K
3.2. On transfer, pt afebrile with HR 101, BP 110/64, RR 20s,
and O2 sat 100% on above vent settings with ABG 7.48/34/109.
.
On the floor, pt sedated.

Past Medical History:

[**2167-6-9**] OSH CT chest:
1. Left lung collapse with leftward shift of the mediastinal
structures.
Hypodense material within the airways of the left lung, mostly
within the left lung base which could be aspirated material or
mucous impaction. Bronchoscopy is recommended for further
evaluation.
2. Small to moderate-sized pericardial effusion.
3. Ill-defined nodular opacities in the right lower lobe which
could indicate small airway disease or aspiration.
.
[**2167-6-13**] CT Thorax:
1. Residual dense consolidation in the left lower lobe.
2. Patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe but increased
aeration of the left upper lobe compared to prior study.
3. Patchy atelectasis in the right upper and lower lobes.
4. Small pleural effusions which have developed since the prior
study
bilaterally. Moderate pericardial effusion which has increased
from prior
study.
5. Small amount of free fluid in the gallbladder fossa and in
the pelvis.
.
[**2167-6-23**] Video Swallow Eval:

[**2167-6-23**] Chest xray: FINDINGS: The NG tube passes along the
expected route of the esophagus, into the stomach. Comparison to
the previous study shows the left lower lobe atelectasis has
cleared. The right lower lobe border is not seen but the lungs
are clear with no mass, consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. Heart and mediastinal structures are normal.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory position of the NG tube. The lungs are
clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
43 yo female with h/o bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who
presented to OSH with increased lethargy and hypoxemic
respiratory failure requiring intubation and found to have left
lung collapse.
.
# Respiratory failure: Bronchoscopy on admission without
evidence of obstructive lesion. Left lung collapse thought to be
secondary to consolidative pneumonia with copious secretions.
Respiratory cultures grew out pansensitive MSSA, and initial
broad coverage with vanc, zosyn, and levofloxacin pared down to
zosyn and then to nafcillin. Multiple bronchs done given
persistent copious sputum with gradual improvememt in purulent
secretions seen in left lung, pt eventually extubated s
complication. PICC placed for long-term administration of abx,
pt recieved total of 14day course, last day: [**2167-6-23**].
.
# Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled per PCP records with concern
in past that pt may have been abusing medications for weight
control. She last filled her prescription for armourthyroid in
[**12-12**] per her pharmacy. Here, TSH level was 54 with a free T4 of
<0.1. Thought to be myxedematous per Endo but not myxedema coma.
Cortisol level normal. Given synthroid with loading dose of 300,
then 75mcg IV daily. On the day of discharge pt was transitioned
to PO synthroid (100 mcg). Most recent TSH was 80 and free T4
0.73.
.
# Altered mental status: Pt initially responsive only to pain.
This was thought [**1-5**] to untreated hypothyrodism v. polypharmacy
v. underlying bipolar disorder v severe infection. No h/o
seizure disorder per OSH records. Utox positive for methadone
and benzos; pt did receive narcan at OSH. Altered mental status
persisted on arrival. Started on synthroid per endo recs for
myxedema. Her home psych meds of topiramate and divalproex were
restarted, her seroquel, clonazepam, provigil, and zolpidem were
initally held pending improvement. Seroque
