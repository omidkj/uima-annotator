   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2102-7-10**] 9:05 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o inf., eff

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old man with s/p avr/cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf., eff
INDICATION: Status post AVR and CABG.

COMPARISON: [**2102-7-5**].

UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: The tracheostomy tube and
right subclavian line are in stable position. There appears to
be a gastrostomy tube. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable. There is improvement in left perihilar and lower lobe
opacities. Right lung is unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Interval slight improvement in left perihilar and
left lower lobe opacities.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Hemodynamic instability s/p CABG/AVR
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2102-6-23**] at 14:15
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2007AW-1:
Test Location: Anesthesia West OR cardiac
Technical Quality: Adequate




REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 20% to 25% (nl >=55%)
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 20 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - Mean Gradient: 8 mm Hg

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Dilated LV cavity. Severe global LV hypokinesis.
Severely
depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.


AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). No
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Myxomatous
mitral valve
leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. TR present -
cannot be
quantified.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient was sedated for the TEE.
Medications and dosages
are listed above (see Test Information section). No TEE related
complications.
Suboptimal image quality - body habitus. Image quality was
suboptimald - poor
esophageal contact.

Conclusions:
Limited/Focused exam for hemodynamic instability s/p CABG AVR.
Image quality
is poor. There is a bioporsthetic aortic valve in place with
normal leaflet
motion. Peak gradent measured 20 mm Hg with a mean gradient of
[**7-20**] mm Hg
(calculated orifice area for the aortic prosthesis was 1.8-1.9).
The left
ventricle is enlarged with severe LV hypokinesis involving all
walls except
the anterior and anteroseptal walls. LVEF 20%. RV is poorly
seen. Basalar
movement appears normal, but hypokinesis of the remaining RV can
not be
excluded. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve
prosthesis is present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but
cannot be quantified. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
There may be some effusion near svc/ra junction, but it is not
seen in all
views. There is no significant fluid or clot seen around the LV
or RV. The
aortic contours are intact without evidence of dissection. An
intra-aortic
balloon pump is seen with it's tip in good position roughly 3 cm
below the
left subclavian. All findings communicated to ICU team PA and
later directly
to surgeon.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the cath lab on [**6-22**] where he was found to be
in cardiogenic shock with left main and 3VD. He was taken to the
operating room emergently where he underwent IABP placement,
CABG x 3 and AVR. He was transferred to the SICU in critic
