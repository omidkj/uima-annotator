pre-CPB: 82 yr old female w/ pmhx of htn and CAD whose
intraoperative echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular
function with an EF> 55% and no evidence of abnormal wall
motion. There was severe mitral regurgitation with myxomatous
degeneration of both leaflets and partail flail. The vena
contracta was > 7 mm.
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good
(>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA. A catheter or pacing wire is seen
in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (?#). Trace
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Partial mitral
leaflet flail. MR vena contracta is >=0.7cm Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.


PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I
certify I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The
patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the
procedure. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
post-CPB: patient was weaned from bypass with 1 mcg/kg/min of
phenylehrine. There was no evidence of new regional wall motion
abnormalities and EF was > 55%. A well seated mitral
annuloplasty ring was seen with interrogation via Doppler
revealing minimal residual regurgitation in the settinag of a
mean gradient of 4 mm Hg. All findings discussed with surgeons
at the time of the exam.
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is partial
mitral leaflet flail. The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is
>=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**7-21**] Ms.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room and underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting x1(left internal mammary artery
grafted to the left anterior descending artery)/Mitral Valve
repair (#28mm CG annuloplasty ring). Cross clamp time = 56
minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time= 74 minutes. Please refer
to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report for further details. She was
transferred in critical but stable condition to the CVICU. She
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
difficulty. All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely
fashion. Beta-blocker and diuretic was initiated. She continued
to progress and was transferred to the step down unit on POD#1
for further monitoring. Physical therapy was consulted and
evaluated the patient.  Ms.[**Known lastname **] postoperative course was
essentially uneventful. She continued to progress and was
cleared by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] for discharge to rehab on POD #5.  All
follow up appointments were advised.
