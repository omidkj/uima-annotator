Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Central Line placement
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 y.o. man, with complicated recent medical history
(detailed below), DM2, HTN, PD, tracheostomy, PEG, who presents
from [**Hospital 100**] rehab.  He was noted to have a fever  of 101.6,
beginning evening of [**2169-1-7**].  He was already on Imipenem (only)
for ESBL Klebsiella in the sputum grown on [**2168-12-20**].  B/c of the
fever, IV vanco 750mg Q12 was started.  Also had elevated CO2
and respiratory distress, so was placed back on the ventilator.
CXR showed RLL pna per rehab notes.  Cultures were drawn [**2169-1-8**],
which eventually grew GNRs.  At this point, the most recent
culture data from [**2169-1-4**] showed acinetobacter in the sputum,
sensitive only to Amikacin.  Treatment had not been given for
this acinetobacter up until this point b/c patient looked well.
Fever persisted up to 103, and on [**2169-1-10**] Amikacin was started.
Despite this, his fever rose to 103.6 on [**2169-1-11**].  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Of note, he had recent pneumonia with ESBL Klebsiella (early [**Month (only) **]
[**2168**], treated with 12 days Meropenem), and Acinetobacter
(treated with Unasyn/Tobramycin, completed [**2168-12-26**]).
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 103, 127/66, HR 110, O2 100% on
ventilator.  He was given tylenol.  CXR suspicious for LLL
infiltrate.  ID curbsided (they follwed during previous
admissions) and recommended covering broadly for HAP with
vanco/meropenem/tobramycin, which were ordered, but only
vancomycin given prior to his ICU transfer.  He transiently
became hypotensive and 2 L normal saline given.  R IJ catheter
placed.  BP stabilized and he never needed pressors.  Admitted
to MICU.

Past Medical History:
- Morbid obesity
- DM type 2 poorly controlled with complications
- Chronic renal insufficiency (new baseline as of [**12-12**] - Cr
1.6-2)
- HTN
- reactive airways disease
- h/o asbestos exposure with pleural plaques
- GERD
- Parkinson's disease
- detrusor instability
- gout
- hypothyroidism
- aortic stenosis, valve area 0.9cm2, peak gradient 24, median
gradient 48
- Anemia
- h/o nephrolithiasis
- Fall in [**8-12**] w/ R subdural hematoma, s/p strep bovis
bacteremia and endocarditis and received 6 wks Ceftriaxone. He
then developed bacteremia with MRSA and enterococcus from a PICC
line infection. The line was removed, he was treated with Vanco.
 After vanco d/c'd, he had negative bloood cx x 3 days.  On
[**2168-11-4**], he was febrile, and blood cxs +  enterococcus, [**Last Name (un) 36**] to
PCN and Vanc. got Vancomycin from [**11-4**]/-[**2168-11-14**] due to PCN
allergy.
.
- Re-admitted [**Date range (3) 95357**] for altered mental status, found
to have pneumonia, NSTEMI (medically managed, wall motion abn on
echo), embolic CVA (thought not contributing to mental status
and no focal motor deficit) and aortic valve endocarditis with
vanco-sensitive enterococcus (course of vanco was to complete
[**2168-12-21**]). Was intubated in the ED with difficult to wean vent
felt. Eventually exctubated on [**11-28**]. Acinetobacter in sputum (?
colonization versus VAP), treated with tobramycin and unasyn
(plan was to d/c on [**12-1**]). Also diuresed with lasix gtt for
volume overload.
.
- Re-admitted [**Date range (3) 95358**], one day after discharge from
MICU, again with respiratory failure, and was re-intubated.
Found to have ESBL Klebsiella and treated with Meropenem x 12
days.  Tracheostomy performed due to copious secretions,
aspiration with inability to protect airway, and recent
prolonged intubation with difficult wean.  Sputum later grew
Acinetobacter on [**2168-12-10**], treated with Unasyn and Tobramycin
initiated [**2168-12-12**] which was to complete [**2168-12-26**].  The patient
improved and was weaned to trach mask.  His hospital course was
complicated by HIT, acute on chronic renal failure, and
hypotension, felt [**2-6**] medications used for intubation.  He was
discharged on [**2168-12-16**] on vanco for endocarditis from prior
hosptialization (to complete [**2168-12-21**]), and Unasyn/Tobramycin
for acinobacter HAP to complete [**2168-12-26**].
