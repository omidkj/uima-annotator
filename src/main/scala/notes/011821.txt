Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
46 year old woman with PMH significant for recent DVT with PE
presents with persistent shortness of breath and chest pain
radiating to her back. She was discharged yesterday from [**Hospital1 **] for similar symptoms. That hospital course was
notable for intubation following aspirin, morphine, metoprolol
administration in the ED, and her worsening respiratory status
may have been related to coronary vasoconstriction from
concomitant use of cocaine while on the beta blocker. She was
discharged with the finding of a new pulmonary nodule, and
returns concerned about that nodule and the possiblility that it
might be malignant.
She says that her chest pain is near her right breast, stabbing,
radiates straight through to her back. She says it is not
related to position but that it worsens with exertion and with
deep breaths. She has shortness of breath associated with the
chest pain. These symptoms started suddenly on [**11-23**] when she
was in [**Location (un) 5354**], right after she exited the plane. She says she
has had associated sweating, occasional palpitations.
Additionally, she has had persistent nausea over the last few
days and complains of loose stools since during the last
admission, with up to 7 bowel movements per day. She denies
vomiting, fever, chills, changes in urination.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she was given ativan 0.5 mg for nausea and put
on oxygen. A CT angiogram demonstrated no PE. She was admitted
to medicine for workup.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Dilated IVC
(>2.5 cm), with
minimal respiratory variation c/w elevated RA pressure of >20
mmHg.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function
(LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Markedly dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV
free wall
hypokinesis. Abnormal septal motion/position consistent with RV

pressure/volume overload.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**12-22**]+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views. Based on
[**2173**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo
findings indicate
a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical decisions
regarding the
need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.
Echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with the
houseofficer
caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with severe global right ventricular
free wall
hypokinesis (relative preservation of the apex/[**Last Name (un) 13367**]
sign). There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Marked right vent
