Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R sided thoracocentesis


History of Present Illness:
77 yo female with pmhx sig for hypertension and ETOH abuse who
initially presented to ED hypotensive and hypothermic after
being found down at her home for an undetermined amount of time.
 Pt was found to have small left parietal subdural hemorrhage
around motor cortex strip, and intraventricular blood on CT
scan, started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.  In addition,
pt noted to have multiple R rib fractures, right nondisplaced
clavicle fracture, and a right distal radial fracture (reduced
and splinted).  Abdominal CT also revealed contusion around the
uncinate process of the pancreas and third portion of duodenum,
with a small amount of fluid.  Patient also noted to have
significant CK elevation.  Pt admitted to trauma [**Hospital 2571**]
transferred to medicine for progressive hypoxia, MICU transfer
requested as pt unable to maintain sat > 88% on 5L NC.  ABG

afternoon.
.
On transfer, pt lethargic but arousable.  Complains of slight
difficulty breathing secondary to pain.  Denies chest pain,
nausea or vomiting.  Cannot recall the details of her fall and
says she "doesn't care".  Son reports that she was found outside
at the bottom of her back steps, fully dressed, at 5 am Monday
morning, ETOH level .96.  Had been in USH, living alone,

RIGHT WRIST XRAY:
There is an obliquely oriented fracture across the distal right
radius which extends into the radiocarpal and radioulnar joint
spaces medially. There is moderate lateral offset and mild to
moderate dorsal angulation.
.
HEAD CT:
1. Small acute subdural hemorrhage along the left inferior
parietal lobe; small amount of intraventricular blood in the
lateral ventricles.
2. Sinusitis; polypoid soft tissue in the frontal sinuses may
represent polyps versus retention cysts.
3. 7 mm scalp hematoma along the right temporofrontal region.
.
C-SPINE CT:
Marked degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Fractures of right ribs.
Emphysematous changes in the lungs with superimposed fluid
overload. Small right pneumothorax.
Dependent soft tissue material in the trachea, which may
represent secretions; attention to this region should be paid on
future imaging.
Findings were relayed to the ED dashboard at the time of
interpretation.
Note added at attending review: The extent of the facet
degenerative changes and fragmentation make it difficult to
exclude subtle facet fracture.
.
CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS:
1. Small amount of fluid around the uncinate process of the
pancreas and third portion of duodenum with a small amount of
fluid at the mesentery, representing contusion.
2. Fluid overload in the lungs, superimposed on emphysematous
changes. Tiny right pneumothorax.
3. Multiple fractures in right ribs and right distal clavicle.
4. Fatty liver.
5. Radiopaque gallstone.
6. Left renal lesion, too small to fully characterize.
7. Left adrenal indeterminate lesion, which can be further
evaluated on subsequent noncontrast CT imaging, or dedicated
adrenal MRI.
8. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
9. Fibroid uterus.
10. Marked degenerative changes of the spine.
.
CXR:
No detectable pneumothorax. Persistent increase in interstitial
pulmonary markings at lung bases.
.
MRI/MRA head: 1.  Small left parietal extra-axial subacute
hematoma in keeping with CT findings of [**2105-10-20**].  Overall, no
significant change in size from [**2105-10-20**].
2.  No acute ischemic event.
3.  Findings consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
change in the
supratentorial white matter.
4.  Polyp versus mucus retention cyst in the left frontal sinus
and air/fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77 yo female smoker with pmhx sig for ETOH abuse, HTN, s/p
fall and LOC resulting in multiple fractures and [**Hospital 56102**]
transferred to MICU for hypoxemia in setting of splinting, COPD,
increasing pleural effusions.
.
# Hypoxemia - On admission, O2 sats were noted to be in mid to
high 80s on [**3-8**] L NC. During hospital course, pt was noted to be
increasingly hypoxic, requiring facemask to keep saturations in
high 80's upon admission to MICU.  Thought to be [**2-5**] underlying
COPD vs. splinting from rib fxs vs. PNA vs. fluid overload.
Patient was never intubated and remained on non-invasive
oxygenation.  She did not want BIPAP.  Given nebs for COPD and
incentive spirotmetry. 7 day course of levaquin started for PNA.
 Pain was controlled with Ultram prn, standing tylenol, prn
dilaudid, prn morphine (pt did not ask for morphine), lidocaine
patch and topical capsaicin.  Diursed for fluid overload.  She
improved and was on 5L NC upon transfer to medicine floor. Had R
sided thoracocentesis performed with 1 L of serosanginuous fluid
removed. Studies consistent with exudative effusion with > 100 K
RBCs and 1800 WBCs, pH 7.47. O2 sats subsequently increased to
low to mid 90s on [**2-6**] L NC. Exudative effusion likely [**2-5**] mixed
picture of blood from multiple R sided rib fractures and WBCs
likely from pneumonic process, although effusion not
parapneumonic. CTA to r/o PE was also considered; however not
obtained as pt did improve s/p thoracentesis and pt likely lives
at lower O2 sat given severe emphysematous changes seen on chest
CT on admission. On discharge, the pt was sating in the mid 90s
on 2L NC.
.
# ETOH abuse- Admission etoh was .96.  Patient initially
received some ativan but she did not need require further ativan
per CIWA scale during hospital course.  No signs/symptoms of
active withdrawal. Social consult consulted for addictions and
followed pt, offering support during hospital course.
.
# SDH - Found to have L parietal extraaxial hematoma and small
intraventricular hemorrhage on admission. No intervention
