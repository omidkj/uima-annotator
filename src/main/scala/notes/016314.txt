Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
brain tumor

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2171-10-16**]: Brain  biopsy
Tracheostomy Placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80yo gentleman with h/o low grade brain
tumor, transfusion dependent MDS, CAD, and AFib not on coumadin
who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] in the setting of hemorrhagic stroke
at the site of his brain tumor.
.
The patient initially presented [**2171-9-12**] to [**Hospital 794**] Hospital in
[**Hospital1 789**] because of concern for aspiration at his rehab
facility. On admission, his exam was notable for left sided
weakness secondary to recent stroke. A PEG was placed and he was
being treated for aspiration/nosocomial PNA with vanc and zosyn.
During his course, he had a brief MICU stay in the setting of
hypoxia, but was soon after sent back to the floor. He continued
to require pRBCs and platelet transfusions on a daily basis for
his MDS.
.
On [**9-25**], he was sent back to the MICU in setting of recurrent
hypoxia and altered mental status. He was intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure felt to be due to increased secretions in
the setting of persistent MRSA pneumonia. CT Head was obtained
for further evaluation of mental status changes in the setting
of thrombocytopenia. CT revealed interval growth of tumor and
new R hemorrhagic lesion. It was unclear whether the bleed was
acute or subacute. Neurosurgery did not feel that the patient
was a surgical candidate, and the team pursued medical
management with mannitol, dilantin, and platelet transfusions.
His mental status improved and he was able to follow commands.
.
Because of concern for possible C diff as well as persistently
positive sputum cultures, the patient was continued on vanc PO,
vanc IV, and zosyn. Apparently, he must have been hypotensive at
some point as there is a note that states pressors were removed.
Zosyn was changed to cefepime because of concern that zosyn may
be contributing to thrombocytopenia.
.
The neurosurgery team at RI did not feel he was an operative
candidate, and the patient is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
neurosurgical evaluation for possible evacuation of hematoma.
.

Imaging
[**10-16**] Head CT
IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes consistent with right frontal
bone burr
hole and biopsy of right frontal lobe lesion. Small area of
layering of
hyperdense material in the lesion consistent with postoperative
blood
products. Mass effect remains similar when compared to prior
scan.

TTE :Very limited image quality. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal-to-hyperdynamic (LVEF>60%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The [**Month/Year (2) 8813**] valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but [**Month/Year (2) 8813**] stenosis is not present.

[**10-8**] LENIS: IMPRESSION: No deep vein thrombosis.

[**Month/Year (2) 4338**] [**10-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Complex, multilocular right frontal intra-axial mass, now
demonstrating a cystic hemorrhagic component, inferiorly,
corresponding to the recent CT
studies, but new in comparison to the most recent cranial MR of
[**2171-7-15**].
2. The enhancing soft tissue nodular and cystic components are
not
significantly changed in comparison to prior studies, with no
new
enhancement.
3. Persistent opacification of the sphenoid sinus and mastoid
air cells.
COMMENT: A primary differential diagnostic consideration for
this tumor, based on the series of studies, is pleomorphic
xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) which may have cystic cavities,
hemorrhage and calcifications, and may undergo rhabdoid,
teratoid or even anaplastic dedifferentiation. Though previously
thought to affect only younger patients, occasional elderly
patients have recently been reported, with worse prognosis. Less
likely would be subependymoma undergoing cystic and hemorrhagic
involution or, even more remotely, highly unusual appearance of
oligodendroglioma or vascular malformation.

[**10-13**] EEG
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and
disorganized
background and occasional bursts of generalized slowing, a few
of these
more evident just on the right. These findings indicate a
widespread
encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical
structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the
most
common causes. There were no clearly epileptiform features. A
bradycardia was noted.

[**10-17**] CXR
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
sitting
semi-upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with a
preceding
similar study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same date.
During the
interval, the patient has been extubated, and a tracheal cannula
has been
placed. The position is unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax
