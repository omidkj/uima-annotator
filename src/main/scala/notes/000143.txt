Admission Date:  [**2109-7-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2109-7-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2045-9-23**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year-old
female with a history of rheumatic heart disease with mitral
stenosis with a valve area of 0.75 to 0.9 cm squared and
resulting pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 90 to
100 mmHg who was admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] for mitral valvuloplasty.  Per the patient's daughter
the patient has been short of breath and ultimately
bedridden.  For the past few months the patient has had
severe dyspnea with even short trips out of her bed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Rheumatic heart disease and mitral stenosis.
2.  Pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Questionable asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6.  Depression/anxiety.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post cholecystectomy, status
post knee surgery.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Effexor.
2.  Remeron.
3.  Klonopin.
4.  Levoxyl.
5.  Nexium.
6.  Vioxx.
7.  Morphine.
8.  Hydrochlorothiazide questionable dose.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of heart disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiac:  The patient has undergone a
left heart catheterization, which showed clean coronaries.
The patient had a TEE, which showed mean mitral valve
gradient of 12 mmHg with moderate mitral stenosis, mild
mitral leaflet thickening, good MC mobility, normal left
ventricular function and severe pulmonary hypertension of
more then 100 mmHg.  The patient was taken to valvuloplasty,
which improved mitral valve area of 2.6 cm squared by
catheterization and 2.0 cm squared by TEE.  The procedure was
complicated by development of new pericardial
effusion with increasing RA pressures to 22 mmHg.
Pericardiocentesis yielded 350 cc of blood with improved RA
pressures to 8.  Hemopericardium was felt to be secondary to
left atrial perforation, therefore the patient was
transferred to the cardiac care unit for observation.  The
patient has done very well in the cardiac care unit.  The
patient's pericardial drain was discontinued the day
following its placement.  The patient's repeat echocardiogram
has shown mild left atrial dilation, no effusion and normal
left ventricular systolic function.  The patient has had a
repeated echocardiogram on [**2109-7-10**], which was unremarkable and
unchanged.  The patient was subsequently transferred to the
regular medicine floor.  The patient's home medications were
restarted including Zebeta 5 mg, which was increased to 5 mg
subsequently, Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg as well as all of
the patient's outpatient medications.  The patient has done
extremely well and was seen by physical therapy, but was
shown to have decreased endurance, balance and gait due to
prolonged bed rest prior to the hospitalization.  As far as
the status post mitral valvuloplasty the thought is the patient's
pulmonary hypertension that she had on admission is likely to
improve.  The patient has had good systolic function.  On
telemetry the patient has had a few episodes of ventricular
ectopy, which is thought to be due to pericardial irritation. The
patient is to continue Zebeta at her current dose.

2.  Pulmonary is stable.

3.  Renal is stable.  Stable creatinine, normal electrolytes,
which were followed throughout the admission.

4.  Infectious disease:  One of the patient's blood cultures
were positive for gram positive cocci in clusters.  All
subsequent blood cultures were negative for 42 hours.  It was
initially concerning since the patient has been persistently
tachycardic with a rate in the 130s, but this was felt to be
rebound tachycardia fro being off of beta blockers the
patient has been use to taking at home and resolved once the
patient's Zebeta was started at the outpatient dose.  The
patient has remained afebrile throughout the hospital stay
and we opted not to administer antibiotic treatment.

5.  Endocrine:  Hypothyroidism, Levothyroxine was started at
25 mg po q day.  The patient is to be followed by TSH and
free T4 in four to six weeks by her primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient has had borderline elevated fasting blood sugars
during the hospitalization.  The patient is to have
hemoglobin A1C checked by her primary care physician.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home with VNA for nursing and physical
therapy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Zebeta 10 mg po q.d.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg po q.d.
3.  Clonazepam.
4.  Remeron.
5.  Venlafaxine.
6.  Levothyroxine 25 mg po q.d.
7.  Nitroglycerin sublingual prn.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks following discharge.  The patient is
also to follow up with her primary care physician in one week
following discharge.  The patient is to schedule this
appointment.  The patient is to return home with VNA for
nursing and physical therapy.
