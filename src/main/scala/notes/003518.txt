Chief Complaint:
Right shoulder infection

Arthroscopy and drainage of right shoulder
Intubation
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old man who was transfered from [**Hospital **] for surgical evaluation of his right shoulder. Per
records, he had visited [**Hospital3 **] 2 times within the last
2 weeks for right shoulder pain after a fall which was without
fracture. He was sent with pain medications and outpatient f/u.
He had an MRI which was unrevealing (per [**Location (un) **] records). On
[**5-28**] he was admitted to [**Hospital3 7569**] for increased weakness,
fevers, and right shoulder pain.

In [**Location (un) **] ED he was noted to have WBC of 16.7 with 54 neuts and
34 bands. He denied N/V, chest pain, SOB, abd pain, headache, or
syncope. CXR showed no pneumonia. Right shoulder was reportedly
swollen and erythematous. U/S showed a fluid collection under
the deltoid and ortho was consulted. They deferred surgery given
his persistent hyponatremia.

He continued to spike fevers, developed ARF with BUN/Cr of
51/2.6 (baseline 1.0). He became hypotensive and required
levaphed. LFTs remained stable and RUQ U/S was negative. Since
it was felt that he needed surgical drainage of his shoulder, he
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. He had 2 peripheral IVs, and was
recieving levaphed through them.

He arrived on the floor, on max dose of levaphed through his
peripheral IV, but was noted to have a pressure of 170s/100s.
Levaphed was weaned off entirely and the patient remained
stable.

Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. No recent change
in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias.

[**2184-6-1**] ECG: Baseline artifact. Atrial fibrillation or probable
atrial flutter with predominantly 2:1 block. The baseline is
difficult in terms of making differentiation between atrial
flutter and atrial fibrillation and possible ST-T wave
abnormalities. There certainly is an RSR' pattern in lead V1.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

[**2184-6-2**] CT head: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
CT
evidence of acute large vascular territorial infarction. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. The ventricles and sulci
are normal in size and configuration. There is no shift of
midline structures. The basilar cisterns are preserved. There
are no abnormal extra-axial fluid collections. Osseous
structures demonstrate no fracture. There is minimal mucosal
thickening with small mucus-retention cysts in the right
maxillary sinus. The mastoid air cells are normally-pneumatized
and clear. There are punctate calcifications in the vertex scalp
soft tissues, of uncertain significance.

[**2184-6-2**]: CT Abdomen:
1. No evidence of obstruction or volvulus.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis,
new since
outside hospital CT of [**2184-5-28**].

[**2184-6-4**]: MRI Shoulder:
1. Complex, enhancing joint effusion with associated loculated
collections in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa and the
subscapularis recess. Findings are consistent with an
inflammatory and/or infectious arthritis.
2. Full-thickness supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendon tears
with tendon
retraction.
3. No definite osteomyelitis.

Echocardiogram [**2184-6-5**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with probably mild inferior septal hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

[**2184-6-5**]: MRI/MRA of the head:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries
of anterior and posterior circulation. Distal left vertebral
artery ends in posterior- inferior cerebellar artery, a normal
variation.

[**2184-6-8**]: CXR - IMPRESSION: Satisfactory position of the
left-sided PICC line with the tip in the lower SVC. Interval
improvement in degree of atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
Mild cardiomegaly with no overt evidence of pulmonary edema.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old male with a history of ETOH abuse and
hypertension transferred from an OSH for septic shock with
concern for septic right shoulder.

# Septic shock/Septic Shoulder/HAP: The patient was transferred
from OSH on levophed but hypertensive on arrival. Levophed
weaned off without difficulty. R shoulder suspected source but
cell count from initial joint tap by Ortho not clearly septic
appearing with WBC only 18,000 in setting of traumatic tap with
negative culture. Given agitation, patient required intubation
for MRI shoulder. While awaiting that study, lung bases on CT
showed pneumonia, presumed HAP. Levofloxacin was discontinued
but patient continued on vanc/zosyn, which was later changed to
vanc/meropenem given concern for drug rash. Pt subsequently had
MRI shoulder which showed a complex joint effusion with
loculated collections in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa and
the subscapularis recess. R shoulder was re-tapped, this time
with 101,500 WBC although still culture negative. Pt underwent
wash-out of septic right shoulder on [**2184-6-5**] requiring extensive
debridement and notable for finding of rotator cuff tear;
intraarticular and subacromial subdeltoid bursal drains left in
place. He underwent joint washout whic
