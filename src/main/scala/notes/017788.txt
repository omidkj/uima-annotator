PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, examination revealed a
temperature of 98.3, heart rate 62 and blood pressure 134/54.
She appeared comfortable in no acute distress.  Chest was
clear bilaterally.  The heart was regular.  The abdomen was
soft, with tenderness in the left lower quadrant, with a
palpable mass, no rebound or guarding.  Rectal was guaiac
negative with stool in the vault.  There was palpation of the
posterior tibial bilaterally and the dorsalis pedis only on
the right side.  There was a skin graft which showed a
positive thrill.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
9.2, hematocrit 36.0.  Potassium 5.0, blood urea nitrogen 30
and creatinine 4.6.  INR 1.1.  All other laboratories were
within normal limits.

CT of the abdomen demonstrated a complete small bowel
obstruction with an abnormal segment in the distal jejunum
which was consistent with closed loop obstruction.

Electrocardiogram on admission showed normal sinus rhythm, no
ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was immediately taken to the
operating room.  Prior to going to surgery, the patient had a
pulmonary artery catheter placed which immediately
demonstrated adequate cardiac output and index and good
intravascular volume resuscitation.  After hemodynamics were
established and found to be adequate, she was taken to the
operating room where exploratory laparotomy was performed and
lysis of adhesions was performed on a band which had caused a
closed loop obstruction.  After the completion of the lysis
of adhesions, all the bowel was found to be viable and the
patient was closed and taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit
in stable condition.  The details of the surgery are found in
the operative note.

Postoperatively, the patient remained in stable condition
with good hemodynamics from the pulmonary artery catheter.
Electrocardiogram showed no changes.  The patient was ruled
out with cardiac enzymes times three.  She then spent the
night in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and postoperative day
number one her pulmonary artery catheter was changed to a
central venous line and she was transferred to the floor for
continuation of her care.  Postoperative day number two, the
patient remained afebrile and reported flatus and her
nasogastric tube was discontinued.  During her postoperative
course, she was followed by [**Hospital **] Clinic for her diabetes
mellitus for which she was on insulin pump and her insulin
was kept in good control.  She was also followed by the renal
fellow and she continued on her hemodialysis as an inpatient
without incident.  On postoperative day number three, she was
started on some clears, had minimal nausea and was continued
on hemodialysis.  On postoperative day number four, the
patient was advanced.  Nausea had subsided.  On postoperative
day number five, the patient reported bowel movement,
tolerating diet, ambulating and is now ready for discharge.
