RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGING:  Echocardiogram [**2113-11-12**]:  Ejection
fraction 20%,  left atrium mildly dilated, left ventricular
wall thickness normal, left ventricular cavity moderately
dilated, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and
severe focal hypokinesis of the apical and mid-ventricular
segments of the right ventricle.  Chest x-ray, [**2113-11-11**]:
Patchy opacities at both lung bases, consistent with
pneumonia, left lower lobe collapse.  Abdominal x-ray:  No
intestinal obstruction or ileus, no soft tissue masses.
Abdominal ultrasound:  Findings consistent with fatty
infiltration of the liver, no evidence of hepatic or portal
vein venous thrombosis, no evidence of biliary ductal
obstruction.  CT angiography:  Moderate consolidations
bilaterally with associated atelectasis, consistent with
pneumonia, no evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Electrocardiogram:  Sinus tachycardia at 129, intervals
.12/.08/.45, normal axis, nonspecific ST wave changes, left
atrial enlargement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 35-year-old male with no
significant past medical history, admitted for bilateral
pneumonia and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for increasing respiratory distress.  Laboratory data
revealed low serum calcium and elevated phosphate, consistent
with a primary hypoparathyroidism.  The patient was found to
have a dilated cardiomyopathy and transaminitis on admission.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with respiratory
distress and chest x-ray consistent with pneumonia.  The
patient had no cardiac risk factors on admission.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a long QT
interval, consistent with hypocalcemia, and nonspecific ST
wave changes.  Given elevated CPK of 921 on admission, the
patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.  The patient
had elevated CPKs with flat MB and slightly elevated troponin
(peak troponin 2.4), likely related to congestive heart
failure.  Given elevated CPK and probable rhabdomyolysis, the
patient was hydrated with 3 liters of normal saline over a 12
hour period.  With hydration, the patient's dyspnea
subsequently worsened, and chest x-ray obtained showed
increased interstitial markings.  The patient was given
intravenous lasix with approximately one to two liter
diuresis, and a significant improvement in cardiac status.

Given congestive heart failure, a bedside echocardiogram was
obtained, which showed an ejection fraction of 20%, with
dilated left atrium and left ventricle, and severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis and severe focal hypokinesis of
the apical and mid-ventricular segments of the right
ventricle, consistent with a dilated cardiomyopathy.  The
patient was subsequently started on low-dose ACE inhibitor
and lasix 20 mg by mouth once daily.  Etiology of
cardiomyopathy included infectious vs. hypocalcemia vs.
alcoholic, given the patient's history of alcohol use.  Iron
and ceruloplasmin levels were obtained and were within normal
limits.  In addition, to evaluate for infectious etiology,
CMV, [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus, and leptospira antibodies were sent
and were all negative.

As the patient clinically improved with calcium
supplementation, it was thought that cardiac failure might
possibly be secondary to hypocalcemia.  Given that the
patient had persistent tachycardia with pulse in the 120s and
hypoxia, the patient went for a CT angiography to rule out
pulmonary embolus.  CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolus, and the patient was started on carvedilol, given low
ejection fraction on echocardiogram.

The patient was admitted with a CPK of 921, with flat MB.
Etiology of elevated CPK is unknown.  The patient's CPK
decreased throughout the admission, with a CPK of 188 prior
to discharge.  Of note, the patient had a three and six beat
run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry, in
the setting of hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia.

2.  Endocrinology:  The patient was admitted with
hypocalcemia with low calcium level of 4.3 and high phosphate
in a setting of normal renal function, low vit
