Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena and newly diagnosed colonic mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation times 3

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 74F with PMH COPD on home O2 2L, CAD (+ stress test, not
cathed), HTN, hx DVT on coumadin presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital
on [**7-28**] with a CC of dark stools and foot pain. Dark stools
started in the 2 days prior to presentation and were associated
with fatigue and increased SOB. No fever, chills, abdominal
pain, BRBPR, n/v, hemoptysis, syncope or CP.  She was found to
be guaiac + with a HCT of 22. No evidence of upper GIB on
endoscopy, but colonoscopy revealed an appendiceal/cecal mass
with an ulcerated center, bx: high grade dysplasia with no
definite adenocarcinoma. CT showed cecal wall thickening
corresponding to mass location, mildly proominent right hilar
lymphadenopathy of unclera significance, and no evidence of
metastatic disease. She received 2 u pRBC and HCT stabilized at
29. Given patient's high surgical and procedural risk, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further pre-operative assessment and
ultimately treatment of her colonic mass.

Upon transfer, patient's vitals were 112/42, 70, 18, 93% on 2L
NC. She reported only mild abdominal pain and her baseline SOB.
ROS otherwise negative.

Imaging:
CTA
FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place, 3.6 cm above the
carina.  An
enteric tube traverses inferiorly into the stomach out of view.
The aorta is normal in caliber without acute pathology.  The
pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified to the subsegmental
level without filling defects to  suggest pulmonary embolism.
The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion.
Extensive multivessel coronary arterial calcifications are
present.  A small 8mm penetrating aortic ulcer is present in the
arch distal to the left subclavian origin.  There is a bovine
arch configuration of the arch vessels, compatible with normal
anatomic variation.  Small hilar lymph nodes may be present,
nonspecific.

There is extensive biapical predominant centrilobular emphysema.
 Note is made of subsegmental atelectasis of the lingula.
Abrupt attenuation of the
subsegmental and lower order branches of the bronchi supplying
the lingula (4, 85-88) could represent sequela of a prior
infection such as scarring (which could be correlated with prior
exam if available).

There is trace right dependent atelectasis.  No obvious
pulmonary nodule or
mass.

There are wedge compressions involving T4-5 vertebral bodies,
status post vertebroplasty with hyperdense material within the
vertebral bodies. There is also wedge compression of what
appears to be T7 vertebral body, with a 30% loss of height, age
indeterminate.

Limited subdiaphragmatic evaluation demonstrates two exophytic
right renal
cysts, the inferior of which measuring approximately 20
Hounsfield units,
which could represent proteinaceous or hemorrhagic component,
but is
incompletely assessed.

There is diffuse moderate atherosclerotic disease throughout the
imaged
portion of the aorta, without aneurysm.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  8-mm penetrating aortic ulcer in the aortic arch distal to
the arch vessel origins.  Diffuse moderate atherosclerotic
disease.
3.  Moderate diffuse centrilobular emphysema.
4.  Subsegmental lingular atelectasis.
5.  Probable right renal cysts, the inferior of which is
hyperdense. Consider ultrasound for further evaluation.
6.  Severe multivessel coronary arterial disease.

TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. No right-to-left shunt is seen on
agitated saline injection at rest. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
74F with PMH COPD on O2, CAD, HTN, DVT previously on coumadin,
presented to OSH with 2 days of melena and was found to be
anemic to HCT 22 with an appendical/cecal ulcerated mass.

#. COPD- During hospitalization, patient's COPD was initially
treated with Advair, Spiriva, and albuterol nebulizers as
needed. She was maintained on 2L of O2 by NC, which is also her
home dose. She was noted to become tachycardic and acutely
desaturated to 70% requiring emergent intubation by anesthesia.
She was subsequently transferred to the MICU for further
management. She was extenuated and initially fared well, though
the patient did experience acute episodes of shortness of
breath. She acutely desautrated to 60% on 2L and had to be
emergently intubated. The patient tolerated ventilation well and
was breathing more comfortably on the ventilator. She was
started on treatment for COPD exacerbation. In light of the
end-stage nature of her COPD, ongoing discussions were carried
out with the patient's daughter [**Name (NI) 15528**] her mother's goals of
care. The patient was subsequently extubated, but quickly
required re-intubation for respiratory distress and concern for
fatigue despite PPV. After patient's third intubation, the
decision was made by the patient's daughter with the help of
on-going discussions by palliative care to transition the
patient to comfort measures only. She expired.
