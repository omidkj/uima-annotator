Service:  MICU GREEN

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxia, status post fall.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a
73-year-old female with a history of COPD with an FEV1 of
1.15 and right ventricular failure secondary to cor pulmonale
who presents to the Emergency Room status post fall.  The
patient reports a recent decline in health over the past few
weeks with increasing leg edema, bilateral leg weakness, and
calf redness.  The patient was evaluated by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**2159-10-31**] for increasing leg erythema and edema.  Lasix was
given at 40 mg and an echocardiogram was performed which
revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, left ventricular
hypokinesis, increased pulmonary artery pressure, unchanged
from prior in [**2158**] and a small pericardial effusion.  The
patient was given Bactroban and Rheumatology follow-up was
set up.  She was also given hydrocodone for pain.

The patient then developed nausea and vomited times two on
the day prior to admission.  She also reported poor p.o.
intake times one day prior to admission.  On the day of
admission, the patient awoke and noticed that her lower
extremity edema was still worsened.  She also complained of
bilateral leg weakness and pain.  The patient then fell
slowly to her left side with no trauma or loss of
consciousness.

She was brought to the Emergency Room by ambulance.  She was
noted to be hypoxic at 68% on room air and then 84% on room
air with blood pressure 140/90, respiration 18, and an ABG
demonstrated a pH of 7.19, carbon dioxide of 74, and glucose
of 122 on 100% nonrebreather.  Additionally, her 02
saturation on 100% nonrebreather rose to 93%.  A chest x-ray
was done which demonstrated left lower lobe collapse.  The
patient also had bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right.  BIPAP was initiated but the patient was
intolerant of this.  Cultures were drawn and levo and Flagyl
were started.  Additionally, the patient had lavage with
coffee ground emesis with no [**Year (4 digits) **] blood.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  COPD:  PFTs in [**6-2**] revealed an FEV1 of 1.15.
2.  CHF:  Echocardiogram in [**11-2**] revealed a left ventricular
ejection fraction 55% with elevated pulmonary artery
pressures and right ventricular hypokinesis, a small
pericardial effusion.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Diabetes, is on oral medications,
5.  Incarcerated hernia, umbilical in [**2151**] and femoral in
[**2152**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to oxacillin which causes
a rash.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  HCTZ 20 mg one p.o. q.d.
2.  Glyburide 1.25 one p.o. q.d.

4.  Aspirin 81 mg one p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., was increased to 40 mg p.o. q.d.
on [**2159-11-2**].

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 10.1, hematocrit
58.7, baseline 49, platelet count 191,000.  Sodium 131,
potassium 5.6, chloride 92, bicarbonate 27, BUN 45,
creatinine 2.3, baseline 0.9, anion gap 12, glucose 158.  The
U/A had a specific gravity of 1.021, trace blood, 30 protein,

EKG revealed right axis low voltage, no acute ST changes, Q
wave inversions in I, II, and old anterior Q waves are noted.

CK 157, CK MB 16.  Troponins 0.35.

ABG 7.19 pH, carbon dioxide 74, old, PC02 runs 75-79, oxygen
122 on 100% nonrebreather.

Echocardiogram on [**2159-10-31**] revealed EF greater than 55%,
dilated right and left atrium, moderate symmetrical LVH, left
ventricular cavity normal, moderate dilatation of the right
ventricle, right ventricular hypokinesis, 2+ TR, moderate
PAF, hypertension, right atrium and PAFP pressures 52, small
pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  HYPOXIA:  The patient appeared to have
a left lower lung collapse on chest x-ray and there were
decreased breath sounds at the left base.  There is a
question of mucous plug as well as concern regarding
malignancy.  CT revealed that the patient had a moderately
enlarged heart, course calcifications of her coronary
vessels, bilateral effusions with atelectasis of the left
lower lobe, no mass lesions were identified.  Bronchi were
patent.  There was no significant axillary, mediastinal, or
hilar adenopathy.  Anasarca was noted.  Fullness of the right
adrenals were noted, unchanged from prior study in [**3-4**].

The patient also had bilateral ultrasound Doppler studies
performed of her lower extremities to rule out a PE, both of
these were negative.  A CTA was not performed given that the
patient had acute renal failure on admission and a V/Q was
not performed given that the patient had poor lung
examination and hence would not be helpful.

The patient was empirically maintained on levo and clinda to
empirically cover for a possible pneumonia.  Cultures were
drawn and sputum cultures were also checked.  All cultures
were negative.  However, the patient was continued on
levofloxacin for a total of a ten day course to be completed
at the outside hospital.  Additionally, given that the
patient had pleural effusions, she had two thoracenteses that
were performed; one performed on the left side, approximately
1 liter of fluid was removed.  It was noted to be transudate
in nature.  Additionally, the patient had a second
thoracentesis performed on the right side.  Again, the
findings were consistent with a transudate.  On the second
tap on the right side, only 30 cc were removed.  The patient
was to go down for an ultrasound-guided tap of the right side
to give her a therapeutic tap to help her with her
examination.

Additionally, the patient had a bronchoscopy on [**2159-11-7**].
The findings of this bronchoscopy were that the patient had
bronchomalacia, left greater than right with easily collapsed
airway on exhalation.  There were minimal secretions.  No
mucous plug and no bronchial lesions were noted.

The patient underwent aggressive chest PT and physical
therapy in the hospital.  During the patient's
hospitalization, the patient's pulmonary status improved.
Her ABG by the time of discharge had improved significantly
and her last gas prior to discharge was 7.30, 65, and 83.
