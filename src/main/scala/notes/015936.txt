Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old male with a history of CHF (EF 15%)
and atrial fibrillation who presents with a dry cough and
shortness of breath.

Recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 96630**]) with shortness of breath secondary
to heart failure. A repeat echo at that time showed worsened
dilated cardiomyopathy (EF of [**9-28**]%) with severe tricuspid
regurgitation. He was placed on a lasix drip and HCTZ was added,
with good response. At the time of discharge, his regimen
included lasix 160mg [**Hospital1 **], HCTZ 25mg daily, and carvedilol 12.5mg
[**Hospital1 **]. Digoxin was discontinued. His weight at the time of
discharge was reportedly 138 pounds.

Over the last few days, patient reports increasing shortness of
breath and cough. Has stable 2 pillow orthopnea and PND
(although he gets poor sleep at baseline). Denies any dietary
indiscretion (reports very low salt intake) or medication
non-compliance. No chest pains or discomfort at rest or with
exertion. He collects his urine daily and has noted about 1200cc
daily, which has not changed. He deniesy any lower extremity
edeam. Can walk around his home and states that he continues to
make his own breakfast.

In the ED, T 96.1, BP 70/58, HR 68, RR 20 and 02 sat 94% on 4
liters. His BP fell to 66/40, but he continued to mentate well.
250cc or IVF were given.

A RIJ was placed under sterile conditions. CVP was measured at
20-25. Dopamine was started. Levaquin/Flagyl were given.

Initially was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU. There, a lasix ggt was
started with 120cc of urine in one hour. His coumadin was held
in the setting of an oozing right IJ site. Given that his
hypotension was felt to be cardiogenic in nature, he was
transferred to the CCU for further care.

Upon arrival to the CCU, the patient continued to feeling mildly
short of breath while lying flat. There was no difference with
raising the head of the bed.

CXR ([**2182-3-27**]):
1. Persistent interstitial pattern, raising concern for a
chronic interstitial disease especially considering persistence
since CT of [**2181-7-10**]. This is nonspecific but could
potentially be due to amiodarone lung toxicity. Further
evaluation could be performed with pulmonary function testing
and high- resolution CT if warranted clinically.
2. Persistent small left and increasing moderate right pleural
effusion. Apparent elevation of right hemidiaphragm could
reflect a more substantial subpulmonic component.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Congestive heart failure:
Known history of severely depressed EF, 15-20%. Also with severe
TR and mild to moderate MR. Recently admitted for CHF requiring
lasix drip for diuresis 10 days ago and returned with 10# weight
gain and increased SOB/DOE.  He was initially admitted to the
CCU and placed on a dopamine gtt (6mcg/kg/min) and lasix gtt
(10mg/hr) to assist with forward flow and diuresis.  This was
initially mildly successful at removing 2-3kg of fluid but he
could not tolerate the dopamine due to tachycardia exacerbating
his atrial fibrillation and this was weaned off.  He eventually
became resistant to the lasix gtt and this was transitioned to
PO.  When this was not effective, bumetonide was tried (later
with HCTZ) with better effect.  Given his poor prognosis and his
frequent hospitalizations, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] from hospice care was
called to help coordinate his transition to home with hospice
given his end stage heart failure.  The patient stated that he
wished to be at home with family and understood the gravity of
his condition as well as his poor prognosis and declined rehab
or an inpatient hospice facility.

2. Rhythm: History of atrial flutter s/p ablation; now with
atrial fibrillation. Given his end stage heart failure and his
desire to be home with hospice, his ICD was disabled on [**3-29**] in
accordance with his wishes.  His INR was elevated during his
stay and he was sent home off coumadin.

3. CAD: Most recent cardiac cath did not show evidence of CA
