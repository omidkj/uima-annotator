Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo female with h/o CAD s/p CABG, DM, Asthma, presents with
worsening SOB and fatigue.
.
SYSTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Pt presents with increasing
dypsnea, BNP 57,925 and evidence of fluid overload on exam with
JVP to 12cm-all suggesting a low output state. Low output state
is also likely exacerbated by her anemia and ASD.  She was
started on dopamine as well as lasix drip.  Central access was
obtained on admission and discontinued on [**9-23**].  Lasix and
dopamine drips were weaned following a modest diuresis.  She was
discharged on increased dose of torsemide and started on
hydrochlorothiazide, with oupatient follow up scheduled.
.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: On admission, she was without chest
pain, EKG unchanged, Trop 1.07 likely in setting of acute renal
failure.  She was continued on aspirin, plavix.  Her beta
blocker was temporarily held.
.
FATIGUE: She was admitted with significant fatigue that was most
likely multifactorial secondary to chronic heart failure, anemia
and Myelofibrosis.  She was transfused 1 U PRBCs, with
significant releif of symptoms.
.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILULRE:  She had a creatinine of 4.2 on
admsission, thought to be likely related to poor forward flow in
the setting of a CHF exacerbation.  Her creatinine improved with
diuresis and was 1.6 on discharge.
.
PNEUMOTHORAX: She developed a pneumothorax following RIJ line
placement.  This was followed by serial chest x-rays and
resolved spontanously.
.
DIABETES: Diet controlled at home, she was started on an insulin
sliding scale in house.
.
ASTHMA: She was continued on her home nebs
.
MYELOFIBROSIS: She has chronic amemia and a 26 mo prognosis from
myelofivrosis.  She is on Aranesp injections weekly at home,
last documented [**9-19**] and missed recent appts.  She has a
chronically low Hct and, as a consequence, has been transfused
previously. Likely part of her fatigue/weakness may be [**1-15**]
profound anemia.  She was transfused with 1 U prbcs.
