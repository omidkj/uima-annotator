Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Tracheostomy
Percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]F with DM, HTN, s/p pacer placement for
complete heart block transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on the date of
admission, s/p a fall 2 days prior to her arrival. In the
incident, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was vacuuming at home and fell backwards,
striking her head against toilet.  She denies loss of
consciousness. A CT head was without acute changes, and the pt
was noted to be dehydrated and had LLL PNA.  A CT C spine showed
C2 and C5 laminar fractures, and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for neurosurgical evaluation.  At time of transfer, pt
reportedly had no neuro deficits, was able to move all
extremities, and c/o neck pain at times. She was initially
admitted to the wards for ongoing treatment. Shortly after her
admission, she was noted to have increasing O2 requirements.
She was tachypneic to the 30s-40s, worse with being woken up.
Her O2 requirement - initially 94% 4L NC - increased to 93% on
6L NC, then up to 97-98% on 100% NRB.  At the time of eval, she
was 95% on 12L and she was transferred to the MICU for closer
monitoring with hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

CERVICAL SPINE CT WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

The bones are severely demineralized. There is a comminuted
fracture of the vertebral body of C2, which extends through the
base of the odontoid (odontoid fracture type III, which is
unstable). The odontoid fragment is displaced anteriorly by 4
mm. A small posterior fragment of C2 vertebral body is displaced
into the spinal canal (series 2, images 20-21) without any
significant narrowing of the spinal canal. The fracture extends
into the left vertebral foramen.

There are minimally displaced fractures of the right and left
lamina and the spinous process of C7. There is a nondisplaced
fracture of the left lamina of T3. No definite fractures are
identified at C5, although severe demineralization limits
evaluation.

Mild loss of vertebral body height, disc space narrowing,
degenerative endplate changes and facet arthrosis is present at
multiple levels. Disc/osteophyte complexes at C3/4, C4/5, and
C5/6 result in mild narrowing of the spinal canal.

The left mastoid is underpneumatized compared to the right and
partially opacified. There is a retention cyst in the right
maxillary sinus. The patient is intubated. The thyroid gland is
diffusely enlarged and heterogeneous with multiple nodules.

Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 698**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 4:00 p.m. on [**2146-12-27**].

IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted C2 fracture involving the odontoid (type III
odontoid fracture), which is unstable. The fracture extends
through the left vertebral foramen. If there is a clinical
concern for vertebral dissection, MRA may be performed for
further evaluation.
2. Fracture of bilateral posterior elements of C7.
3. Fracture of left T3 lamina.
4. Partially opacified left mastoid air cells.
5. Diffusely enlarged and nodular thyroid. Further evaluation by
ultrasound is recommended, if not performed previously.

ASSISTANT:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Bronchoscopic-guided tracheostomy
tube placement.

PROCEDURE:  Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration of
secretions.

INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  Tracheostomy tube placement and
therapeutic aspiration of secretions.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was prepped with lidocaine applied to the
endotracheal tube. A flexible bronchoscope was introduced
through the ET tube and into the airway. There were a
moderate amount of secretions throughout the airways which were
therapeutically aspirated. There were no endobronchial lesions
up
to the subsegmental levels. Bronchoscopic imaging was then
performed in order to guide a percutaneous tracheostomy tube
insertion.  After the trachesotomy, a minimal amount of bloody
secretions were removed with the bronchoscope.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.
