Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Accupril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
 pericardiocentitis

History of Present Illness:
This is a 81 year-old female with a history of severe dCHF, CAD
s/p cath [**2121**] (prox LAD), large pericardial effusion, restictive
cardiomyopathy, right ventricular contractile dysfunction,
severe TR, a-fib on coumadin, HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, who
presents with fever and hypotension. The patient was seen at his
PCP office on [**11-28**] with 3 weeks of SOB and 1 week of productive
cough.  He underwent a CXR that showed a right middle lobe
density (infiltrate vs atelectasis), organomegally with a large
pericardial effusion, mild CHF.  Her WBC count was 7.1. He was
started on Moxifloxacin and torsemide was increased to 20mg
daily.  He states that his breathing and cough improved, but
still remains SOB.  He felt warm on Friday, but took tylenol and
did not have any further fevers.  He reports very poor po intake
and weight loss of 9lbs over the last week.  He noticed pain in
his right 2nd digit that began to turn red and have pain.  It
was associated with swelling and worsening pain.
.
In the ED, 101.0 86 87/59 22 98% 4L.  He was noted to have
erythema and lower ext edema on his right foot and leg.  Labs
were significant for  WBC 8.7, lactate 2.0, INR: 3.3 and Cr.
2.0.  CXR showed massive cardiomegaly and difficult to assess
infiltrates.  He continued to be hypotensive to the SBP 70's and
a RIJ was attempted.  Given his INR the line was aborted and a
small hematoma formed.  An umcomplicated right femoral line was
placed. He was given 2L IVF and started on norepinephrine 0.06.
He was covered with Vancomycin and Zosyn empirically.  A bedside
ECHO was performed and showed a large chronic posterior effusion
that reportly did not show evidence of tamponade.
.
Vitals on transfer were 96 105/60 24 94%3L.  On arrive the
patient was bleeding from his RIJ and 10 minutes of pressure
were applied and a new dressing was placed.  A pulsus was
checked and was 8.  The patient reports his breathing is
comfortable as long as he does not move.
.
Of note, he was treated for left leg cellulitis with 10 days of
bactrim and 17 days of clindamycin finishing [**2126-11-1**].
.
ROS: The patient denies any chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain,
urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait
unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or
skin changes.

Past Medical History:
-Chronic permanent atrial fibrillation
-CAD s/p cardiac cath [**2121**] showing a 95% lesion in the proximal

LAD, which was stented with a Cypher stent
-Prior concern for amyloid cardiomyopathy (had had marked LVH
with very enlarged right and left atria). s/p negative abdominal
 wall fat biopsy [**11/2122**] (Fibroadipose tissue; no diagnostic
abnormalities recognized; amyloid stains are negative. The
controls are appropriate)
-Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. An echocardiogram in
[**2123-4-30**] showed an LVEF > 65% with a peak resting LVOT
gradient of 40 mmHg. This gradient is slightly higher than it
had been seen in [**2122-8-30**].
-Chronic wheezing and asthmatic-type symptoms.
-Eosinophilia.
-Possible strongyloidiasis leading to eosinophilia and even
pulmonary symptoms. Treated with ivermectin 25 mg per day for
two days
-FVC of 60% predicted and FEV1 of 69% predicted. It was no
significant change with bronchodilator.
-HTN
-Hypercholesterolemia
-Hyperthyroidism
-BPH
-OA s/p total knee replacement
-OSA on BiPAP at home
-pulmonary artery is significantly enlarged at 5.3 cm as well as
an enlarged ascending aorta of 4.5 cm

live-in house keeper. Smoked 1ppd x 20yrs, quit 20 yrs ago. [**12-1**]
glasses of wine per night.

.
ECG:  a-fib at 102, normal axis,  low voltages, old left bundle,
no significant changes from [**2126-9-16**].
.
CXR ([**12-4**])
FINDINGS: Massive cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is a new
right lower lobe
consolidation. There is a small left pleural effusion, if any.
No right
pleural effusion is seen. There is no pneumothorax identified.
Severe
bilateral shoulder degenerative changes are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. New right lower lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.

2. Unchanged massive cardiomegaly, possibly a combination of an
enlarged
heart and a pericardial effusion.
.
Foot X-ray:
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with tophaceous gout.
Vasculopathy.
.
TTE
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is severe
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is small. Left ventricular systolic function is
preserved. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is at least mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The effusion appears circumferential. The
pericardial effusion is large around the right atrium and
lateral and posterior to the left ventricle. However the
effusion is <1cm wide anterior to the
