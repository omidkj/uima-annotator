Service:  Cardiac Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old man with
Type 2 diabetes, hypertension who had a melanoma excised from
his back on the day of admission, and was driving back to
[**Location (un) 86**] when he had an acute onset of 5 out of 10 substernal
chest pain with radiation to the neck which was associated
with some mild shortness of breath.  He went to the Emergency
Department at [**Location (un) 620**] where an electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm with significant ST elevation in 2, 3,
AVF and ST depression in V1 and V2 which was consistent with
an acute inferior posterior myocardial infarction.  He was
given Aspirin, heparin, beta blockade, intravenous
nitroglycerin and had resolution of both of his chest pain
and ST changes.  A couple of weeks prior to admission the
patient does report that he had an abnormal exercise
tolerance test.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Zestril, Toprol XL, Aspirin and
multivitamins.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes mellitus Type
2, melanoma and recent back surgery.  He also has
hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke, he does not drink, he
does not use drugs, he is single.  He is an active man and
likes to ice skate.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient has a pulse of 60, blood
pressure of 130/76, respiratory rate of 14.  In general
appearance, he appears in no apparent distress.  He has no
jugulovenous distension.  Respiratory rate is clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His heart is regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs were noted.  He has 2+ and
equal pulses bilaterally with no pedal edema.  His abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the Telemetry
Unit and he [**Known lastname 1834**] a cardiac catheterization on [**1-12**].  Catheterization showed severe multivessel disease with a
50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery, 80% stenosis
of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 50%
stenosis of the left circumflex artery and up to 80% stenosis
of right coronary artery.  His heart function was good with a
left ventricular ejection fraction of 75%.  Because of this
multivessel disease and the patient's diabetes mellitus,
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted and Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was
eventually taken to the Operating Room on [**1-14**],
hospital day #3.  Please refer to the previously dictated
operative note by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from [**2193-1-14**].
In brief, four grafts were performed, the left internal
mammary artery was connected to the left anterior descending
artery and saphenous vein grafts were connected to the
diagonal branch, the obtuse marginal branch and the posterior
descending artery.  Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiopulmonary
bypass for 90 minutes and the aorta was crossclamped for 76
minutes during the procedure.  He tolerated the procedure
well and he was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery
Unit, intubated with Propofol, insulin, Neo-Synephrine drips.
 The patient did well postoperative and on postoperative day
#1 he was extubated and his drips were all weaned, and later
on in the day he was transferred to the floor.  Despite his
significant disease, his postoperative course was relatively
unremarkable.  He was diuresed and beta blocked, and he was
cleared by physical therapy on postoperative day #6.  Of
note, Mr. [**Known lastname 10881**] postoperative course was remarkable for an
oxygen requirement until postoperative day #5, [**1-19**]
which was successfully weaned prior to discharge as well as
hyperglycemia which would be expected for his prior diabetes
mellitus.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and they followed him and
prior to discharge his sugars were much better controlled
than immediately postoperative.  He has a follow up
appointment with his [**Last Name (un) **] doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**1-26**].  On
postoperative day #6, [**2193-1-20**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was
afebrile, stable vital signs.  He was 101.5 kg.  His blood
sugars were ranging 76 to 166.  His wound was clean, dry and
intact.  His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Legs showed mild edema.  A chest
x-ray showed resolution of many congestive heart failure
symptoms and there were no infiltrates.  He was discharged
home with [**Hospital6 407**] care.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  His discharge medications included
Aspirin 325 mg once a day, Metoprolol 75 mg twice a day,
Lipitor 40 mg once a day, Lasix 20 mg twice a day and
[**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel 20 mEq twice a day.  Lasix and [**Doctor First Name 233**]-Ciel were for ten
days.  He was also given a home dose of insulin, NPH 32 units
twice a day, Humalog sliding scale as directed.  He was also
given Percocet and Colace as needed for pain and constipation
respectively.

FOLLOW UP:  He has a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 53858**],
his primary care physician in one to two weeks and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 27658**] his cardiologist in two to three weeks, with [**Last Name (un) **]
doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2193-2-16**] and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one month.
