STUDIES:
EKG [**2147-6-30**]: Sinus rhythm. Occasional atrial premature beats.
Otherwise, no other significant diagnostic abnormality. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2147-6-13**] there is no significant
diagnostic change.

KUB [**2147-6-30**] SUPINE AND LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS VIEWS OF THE
ABDOMEN: No free intraperitoneal air or pneumatosis is
definitively noted. There is stool noted throughout the colon
and nonspecific gaseous distention of the small bowel. No
air-fluid levels were noted on the decubitus view. There are
mild degenerative changes in the imaged spine. Calcified
phleboliths are noted within the pelvis.  IMPRESSION: Moderate
amount of fecal loading throughout the colon with nonspecific
gaseous distention of the small bowel. No free intraperitoneal
air.

CXR [**2147-6-30**] UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The
cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with the
heart size within normal limits. The lungs are clear. The
pulmonary vascularity is normal. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. There are multilevel degenerative changes
in the spine with anterior osteophyte formation. IMPRESSION: No
acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

[**2147-7-3**] Echocardiography: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is significant,
accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve
inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Pericardial constriction cannot be excluded.

[**2147-7-5**] Cardiac MRI Impression:
1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with normal regional left
ventricular systolic function. The LVEF was normal at 69%. The
effective forward LVEF was normal at 62%. Small area of possible
late gadolinium enhancement in the distal lateral wall.
2. Mild flattening of the septum with inspiration, consistent
with possible interventricular dependence in the absence of
other signs of pericardial constriction.
3. No evidence of myocardial restricti
