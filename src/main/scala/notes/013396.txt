History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2429**] is an 86yo female with past medical history of
childhood asthma but minimal contact with [**Name2 (NI) **] for the last
twenty years who was admitted with five days of confusion. Per
her nephew she had not been hospitalized or sick since she was a
child.  Four days prior to arrival her nephew arrived at her
house for a scheduled meeting with some lawyers to discuss an
on-going lawsuit involving her [**Last Name (un) **] association. On arrival to
her condominium he noticed that she was acutely confused and did
not remember any details as to why the lawyers were there or the
events that had led to her involvement with them.  This is
despite the fact she had previously been closely reviewing those
contracts herself.  On the night prior to admission her brother
called her nephew and told him that he was concerned she wasn't
eating.  Her nephew called her and asked what was in her
refrigerator but she told him she didn't know. This worried him
and he eventually convinced her to come to the ED.

In the ED VS were T 98.6 HR 170s BP 112/100 20 99%RA. EKG looked
like SVT, so got adenosine, which slowed her, and the resultant
EKG showed flutter waves. She was given 10mg dilt IV X 1 with BP
to 90s and HR 80s and then received 30mg PO dilt. Her HR came
down to the 80s then went back up to the 110s so she was started
on a diltiazem gtt. Her blood pressures were stable thereafter
in the 110s-120s. Her HR did increase a few times thereafter in
the ED, usually when anxious, which was relieved with lorazepam
X 2.  For her altered mental status she had urine and blood
cultures sent. A chest raidograph was unremarkable aside from
slight volume overload. A head CT showed a left occipital
hypodensity so neurology was consulted and concerned for an
acute stroke.  Tehy recommended a head MRI but this was not
obtainable due to the patient's altered mental status and
agitation.  Neurology also recommended an LP, but this was
refused by the family.  Given concern for infection, she was
empirically started on meropenem/vancomycin and acyclovir as she
had a PCN allergy.  EEG was also recommended but not obtainable
in the ED.  Because of an unknown substance abuse history she
also received thiamine, folate, and a banana bag.

On presentation to the ICU (sent there given concern for acutely
progressing stroke vs CNS infection) the patient denied neck
pain, headaches, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or
similar complaints.  She reported that she had been depressed
for a few days and decided to stop eating. She then got confused
per her report and that's why she had to come to the hospital.

Past Medical History:
-Asthma in childhood
-Bilateral cataract surgeries

Social History:
She never married and worked as a social worker.  She lives
alone but speaks to her [**Age over 90 **] year old brother in [**Name (NI) 614**] daily.
She also has multiple nieces and nephews who help her.  She
stopped smoking 20 years ago.  She denied alcohol use.

OTHER STUDIES
===============
ECG [**2200-6-22**]:
Atrial flutter with 2:1 block. Tendency toward low voltage in
the standard
leads. Peaked T waves in leads V1-V4. No previous tracing
available for
comparison.

REPEAT ECG [**2200-6-22**]:
The patient is now in atrial flutter with 4:1 block and a heart
rate of 88.
There is low voltage in the standard leads. Peaked T waves in
leads V2-V3.
No other diagnostic abnormality.

Chest Radiograph [**2200-6-22**]:
IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of mild CHF.

CT Head W/O Contrast [**2200-6-22**]:
IMPRESSION: Examination limited by motion. A focal left
occipital
hypodensity may represent acute infarct and MRI with
diffusion-weighted
imaging is recommended for further evaluation, as patient can
tolerate. No
intracranial hemorrhage.

Echo [**2200-6-23**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification
resulting in mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 8
mmHg). Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild mitral stenosis. At least
mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Carotid Ultrasounds [**2200-6-25**]:
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On
the right there is mild heterogeneous plaque in the bulb and
ICA. On the left there is moderate heterogeneous plaque in the
ICA.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 63/14, 95/20, 74/19 cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic
velocity is 72 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 72 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA
ratio is 1.3. These findings are consistent with <40% stenosis.
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 125/20, 120/20, 105/21 cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic
velocity is 105 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 124
cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.2. These findings are consistent
with 40-59% stenosis.
There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
There is antegrade left vertebr
