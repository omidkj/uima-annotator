Sputum - negative for legionella
.
Imaging:
CXR [**5-2**]
1. Small amount of opacity at the right base could represent
atelectasis, aspiration cannot be excluded.
2. Slightly prominent pulmonary vasculature, consistent with
volume overload versus mild failure
.
EKG: Probable atrial fibrillation Ventricular premature
complexes includes couplets Right bundle branch block Since
previous tracing of [**2171-6-17**], atrial fibrillation and ventricular
ectopy now present.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2175-5-4**] 9:30 AM

Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2175-5-2**].

The patient is markedly rotated. There is new right lower lobe
consolidation and pleural effusion with obscuring of the
retrocardiac space and right hemidiaphragm. An element of
atelectasis cannot be excluded but is hard to appreciate due to
asymmetric position of the patient.New left lower lobe
consolidation is also demonstrated with no sizable amount of
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 108344**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo gentleman with history of supranuclear
palsy, severe dysphagia and Parkinsonian-like syndrome who was
admitted with respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration
PNA.  His hospital course by problem list is summarized below.
The patient expired on the evening of [**2175-5-5**] from respiratory
failure.
.
Aspiration PNA:
Patient with a history of recurrent aspiration PNA in the
setting of advanced Parkinson's type syndrome.  Occurred in the
setting of likely altered mental status and delirium secondary
to possible infection; CXR with consolidation at R base.
Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring, and started on
Zosyn/Vanco for abx coverage of aspiration PNA/NH acquired PNA.
Patient was DNR/DNI, and was not intubated however his O2
requirement continued to escalate. Patient was transferred to
the regular medical floor for ongoing care. His O2 requirement
increased to 5L then 7L then 10L by NC. He became markedly
tachypneic to RR ~70. Repeat CXR was not consistent with fluid
overload but possible worsening PNA vs. aspiration. Towards the
end he was treated with morphine for respiratory distress. He
also received frequent suctioning to clear his secretion. IV
vancomycin was added for additional coverage. Patient eventually
succumbed to respiratory failure with his family at the bedside.

.
Mental Status changes:
Occurred in setting of poor PO intake, infection and
hypernatremia.  Pt was given free water repletion, treated for
his PNA.  Pt was monitored and left NPO given inability to clear
his secretions.
.
Hypernatremia: Initially elevated to 158 likely secondary to
dehydration and poor po intake. Patient receive free water
repletion judiciously given tenuous fluid balance. His sodium
improved to 148.
.
Code: DNR/DNI  --patient passed away the evening of [**2175-5-5**].
