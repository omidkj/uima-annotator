History of Present Illness:
84 y/o F with hx of COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia and recent
perforated sigmoid diverticulitis on [**1-5**] s/p ex lap, sigmoid
colectomy with [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] at [**Hospital1 **].  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] surgical service on [**2135-1-17**] after her course was
complicated by respiratory failure with persistent L lower lung
collapse, acute renal failure and altered mental status.  While
in the surgical ICU from [**1-17**] to [**2-17**], she was found to have
pulmonary abscesses and started on vanco, zosyn and cipro.  She
improved hemodynamically, but has slow recovery of mental
status.  She had a trach and PEG tube placed for failure to wean
of ventilator.  A pneumothorax occurred after CVL placement and
a CT was placed.  During the admission, she also had unexplained
neutropenia and a BM biopsy.  For diarrhea, she was empirically
treated for c.diff, although no cultures were positive.
.
She was recently seen in ED at OSH for possible pneumonia and
treated with unknown abx at that time at rehab.  Was not
admitted.  Also talking with rehab, she is on a course of IV
flagyl for c.diff.  She in on day [**12-20**] today.
.
Today she presents from rehab with bright red blood per her
colostomy for the last 48 hours.  Also had some blood sputum
through her tracheostomy per report.  Her family is with her and
notes that the last few days she seems more tired than usual but
otherwise well.  No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  Stool is
maroon.  No stool output from her pouch.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.4, 116/71, hr 110, r 12, 98% on
PS 5/5 with 60% FiO2.  She was given cipro 400 mg IV x1 in the
ED.  Her prior PICC site was very erythematous.  Her PICC had
been removed at rehab the day prior to admission.  She had a CXR
without new cardiopulmonary abnormalities; her trach was in
place.  An NG lavage was attempted but unsuccessful via NG tube.
 She had a lavage through her PEG tube which was negative.  She
had [**Last Name (un) 17993**]-maroon stool in her bag.  Her vitals on transfer were
P 113, BP 108/60, R 20, 94% on above vent settings.  She had 2
peripheral IVs for access.
.
On the floor, she is awake and arousable, but not able to talk
because of her trach.  She nods.  She nods no to having no pain.
 Otherwise yes/no review of systems was negative as listed
below.  Her weight has been stable, although she is being
diuresed for fluid overload from previous admission.  She does
have decubitus ulcers.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) GI bleeding: Continued to have grossly bloody output per
ostomy on HD1. Was transfused 1U pRBCs on HD2 when hematocrit
dropped from 29 --> 26.6 and patient was tachycardic and
hypotensive (SBP in 80s). Hct remained stable at 29-31 for
duration of hospitalization and no more bloody output per
ostomy. EGD showed friable gastric and esophageal mucosa but no
active bleeds. Colonoscopy showed ulcers and erythema concerning
for infectious colitis vs. ischemic colitis. Biopsy results
still pending at time of discharge. CT abdomen showed thickening
of bowel near hepatic flexure consistent with colitis, and a
small amount of free intraperitoneal air that could be
consistent after colonoscopy. Surgery followed patient and
deemed her issues could be managed without surgery. She was
treated empirically for c. difficile colitis with IV flagyl and
vancomycin. C. difficile toxin negative x3. She was started on
protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] for friable gastric mucosa seen on EGD, and
will complete a 14-day course of IV flagyll and PO vancomycin
after completing a course of cefepime for her UTI. [**4-13**] should be
the last day of antibiotics. Stool cultures, ova and parasites,
and pathology from colonoscopy pending.

#) Hypotension: on arrival to MICU, patient was hypotensive
(SBPs to high 70s) and tachycardic to 100-110. Felt to be
secondary to hypovolemia. She was bolused 3.5L normal saline and
transfused 1U overnight, which improved her blood pressure. In
the setting of hypotension, her home lopressor dose was
initially held. Subsequently had two brief episodes of
hypotension (SBP to 70s) which responded to 500-1000ml boluses
of normal saline.

#) Atial fibrillation with Rapid ventricular response: on HD3
patient developed elevated heart rate to 140s and was found to
be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She
was rate controlled with diltiazem 10mg IV x1 and then loaded
with digoxin. She converted and remained in sinus rhythm for the
remainder of her ICU stay. In the setting of atrial
fibrillation, her levothyroxine dose was decreased from 200mcg
to 175mcg (she was felt to be slightly therapeutic on
levothyroxine as her TSH was 0.35). Her home lopressor dose
(6.25mg [**Hospital1 **]) was continued when blood pressure permitted.

#) Right arm erythema: at former PICC site. Picc was removed at
rehab and she was treated with IV vancomycin and IV cefepime for
presumed cellulitis. Erythema improved over the course of the
hospitalization. Blood cultures from [**3-17**] showed [**1-10**] positive
for coagulase negative staphaureus, and cultures from [**3-18**] and
[**3-19**] showed no growth. It was thought that the positive tube was
due to a contaminant. As she remained afebrile without a white
count, her IV vancomycin was discontinued after six days of
treatment. Cefepime was continued for treatment of pseudomonas
UTI.
