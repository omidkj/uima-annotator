History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39530**] is a 74 yo M with history of CAD s/p MI, 3V CABG
[**2167**], CHF (EF 25% in [**2179**]), VF arrest s/p ICD [**2179**], who
presented to [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital on [**10-19**] with dyspnea. Of note, he
had been discharged approximately 12 hours before from [**Hospital 487**]
Hospital, where he had a 30 day admission for CHF exacerbation.
Per the daughter, he was still "full of fluid" upon discharge
from [**Hospital1 487**]. He returned home to his assissted living facility
Wednesday evening [**10-18**], and his daughter stayed over with him.
She reports that he was experiencing sever SOB and DOE, and that
he was barely able to walk the length of the hallway without
becoming SOB. She notes that he sounded wheezy and "couldn't
pee." When the VNA nurse came on Thursday morning, he
recommended that he go straight to the hospital "or he will
die." Was brought to [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital for temporary stabilization
before transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for continuity of care with patient's
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5686**].
.
At [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital found to have O2 sat 84% on RA improved to
100% on 40% O2 NRB. Exam showed bibasilar crackles, LE edema to
knees and edema in arms. Given ASA, Lasix 80mg IV, nitropaste,
SL nitro x 3. Put out 300cc urine. OSH labs significant for HCT
28, K 5.0, Cr 2.0, alb 3.0.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED t 97.5, HR 71, BP 89/49 rr 24 02 98% venti mask.
Nitropaste removed. BP 75-80s and dopamine started with good
effect. CPAP placed. Had an episode of "VT" and ICD fired in ED.
Admitted to CCU for CHF exacerbation.
.
Per daughter, patient has not had chest pain. He has dyspnea on
exertion as well as orthopnea and ankle edema. No syncope or
presyncope Has no history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. No recent fevers, chills,
rigors, or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] of the other review of systems
were negative.

[**2180-10-19**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. CHF with bilateral pleural effusions, worse than on [**2179-4-3**].
2. Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis, pulmonary
consolidation or combination of both.
.
[**2180-10-19**] EKG
7PM: Ventricular paced rhythm with wide QRS complexes. Compared
to the prior tracing of [**2179-5-19**] there is a marked diminution in
QRS voltage. Clinical correlation is suggested.
10PM: Atrial fibrillation and increase in rate. As compared with
prior tracing of [**2180-10-19**] right bundle-branch block is now
evident. The limb lead voltage is markedly diminished. There was
low limb lead voltage recorded on [**2179-4-2**] and it is further
reduced. Followup and clinical correlation are suggested.
.
[**2180-10-20**] ECHO
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
20-30 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the
interventricular septum, anterior free wall, and apex. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures
of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The main pulmonary artery is
dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated.
.
[**2180-10-25**] CT Abd/Pelv
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral rectus sheath hematomas.
2. Small focal dissection of the infrarenal aorta.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions, trace ascites.
4. Diffuse calcified granulomata involving the visualized
aspects of the lungs.
5. Diffuse edema and venous distention consistent with the
provided history of CHF. A surgical staple line is seen in the
region of the sigmoid colon, suggesting prior surgery in this
region, although a radiopaque anastomotic suture line is not
identified.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. CHF - Presented in decompensated heart failure with
hypotension and respiratory distress. Was placed on dopamine and
CPAP in the ED. In the CCU we began a lasix drip with eventual
diuresis of almost >10 liters. His home CHF reg of carvedilol
and lisinopril were held given his hypotension and ARF on
presentation. Eventually weaned from dopamine gtt with marginal
BPs (MAP in 50-60s). An echo confirmed systolic CHF with an EF
of 20-30% as well as severe (4+) TR. Patient was eventually
taken off lasix drip and begun on an oral diuresis regimen of
budesonide and metolazone. For CHF, he was started on
spironolactone and eventually a BB (Toprol XL) was restarted as
well. He was also restarted on digoxin qMWF. His repsiratory
status improved throughout his stay and he was in compensated
heart failure at the time of discharge. On discharge, his
diuretic regimen included spirnolactone and bumex. His ACE was
held at discharge pending creatinine stabilizatio
