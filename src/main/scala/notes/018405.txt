Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2156-2-5**].
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild global LV hypokinesis. No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR well
seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
[The amount of AR is normal for this AVR.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate [2+]
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. No
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No RA or RV diastolic
collapse.
Conclusions
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. [The amount of
regurgitation present is normal for this prosthetic aortic
valve.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial or right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

IMPRESSION: Tiny residual echo lucent area anterior to the right
ventricle. No evidence of tamponade. Normally functioning aortic
bioprosthesis. Mild global LV hypokinesis.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-2-5**],
there is now no evidence of cardiac tamponade.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
51 year old man with s/p avr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate rt ptx
HISTORY: AVR repair.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-9**], there is no
change. Again there is a tiny right apical pneumothorax.
Moderate cardiomegaly persists with relatively small bilateral
pleural effusions, more marked on the right. No evidence of
acute pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery. He was seen by hepatology.
He was cleared for surgery by dental. He was seen and followed
by ID. MRI showed diskitis with ? of osteo of the spine. He was
taken to the operating room on [**1-27**] where he underwent a redo
sternotomy, AVR, and CABG x 1. He was transferred to the ICU in
stable condition on epi, neo and propofol. He was extubated on
POD #1. He was given 48 hours of vanocmycin since he was in the
hospital > 24 hours preoperatively. He continued on nafcillin,
and rifampin, and caspofungin for yeast from a blood culture
drawn from a PICC line. He was started on coumadin for his
mechanical valve. He was started on a heparin gtt until his INR
was therapeutic. He was seen by opthamology and fungal eye
infection was ruled out. He developed a small pneumothorax after
his chest tubes were pulled, which was stable on subsequent
chest x rays. He awaited therapeutic INR.
He developed cardiac tamponade and was taken emergently back to
the operating room on [**2-5**]. He was extubated later that same
day. He was transferred back to the floor on POD #1. He was
restarted on coumadin for his mechanical valve. He continued to
have a stable apical pneumothorax. He awaited increasing INR,
and was ready for discharge home on POD #16/7.

He will require completion of a 10 week course of IV nafcillin
and PO rifampin, and has completed a 2 week course of
caspofungin.

[**Doctor First Name **] at Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 76736**] office has agreed to manage coumadin,
goal INR [**1-18**] for mechanical aortic valve.
