Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
found down, Vfib arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
intubation

History of Present Illness:
57 y/o M unknown PMH, presented to OSH after cardiac arrest. Per
report, he was sitting on bench at bus station when witnessed to
become unresponsive after seizure like activity. Estimated time
when EMS was contact[**Name (NI) **] was 13:07. EMS arrived within 3 min,
found him to be in VFib arrest. He was unresponsive pulseless,
apneic, pupils fixed and dilated w/ GCS of 3.
.
He was intubated, shocked x2 (120J, 150J), received Epi 1 mg,
Lido 100 mg + 50 mg IVP and started on Lido gtt. He broke out of
Vfib at around 13:17 with a pulse of 90 and pressure of
140/palp, RR of 4. He also received 100 mcg of fentanyl, 1mg
versed.
.
He reached LGH at around 13:30 when he continued to be
unresponsive, in NSR w/ BP 98/74, HR 90, Sat 100% on Vent, GCS
7. EKG showed ST elevations in infero-lateral leads (I, II, III,
aVF, V4-6); right sided EKG was showed ST elevations in V4. He
was placed on spinal pracautions, given ASA, Plavix, heparin
gtt, integrillin gtt, cont Lido gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
emergent cath.
.
Cath at [**Hospital1 18**] showed:
Right dominant
LMCA: Normal
LAD: mid-segment 50% lesion
LCX: non-dominant with occlussion of OM2 at the bifurcation with
the AVG
LCX: distal vessel is filled from I-I collaterals
RCA: dominant vessel with occlussion midsegment. bridging
collaterals to the distal RCA and -lr collaterals from the
proximal LAD
.
Attempts to cross the LCX occlussion failed despite aggressive
wire manipulation. lesion left untreates given chronicity of the
lesion
.
Wire was passed through the RCA occlussion but attempts to
deliver balloon in the RCA failed. there was no return of distal
flow. Despite the failure of crossing hese occlusions, he
remained hemodynamically stable and ST segments were normal.
.
Hemodynamics:
CO - 4.69
CI - 2.4
Mean pressures: RA 14; PCW 22, PA 24
.
Post-cath in the CCU, he was continued on integrillin drip, his
dopamine was weanted off from 10->5->0 mcg/kg/min, Lidocaine
drip was stopped at 6PM. Hypothermia protocol for VFib arrest
was initiated between 19:00 and 19:15. He was noted to have a
episode of posturing where he had upward deviation of eyes with
extension of both his upper extremities and lower extremities.
This was associated with hypertension to ~200 and tachycardia.
This spontaneously resolved; however he got Ativan, Lopressor
and was started on Versed, Fentanly and Vecuronium gtt per
Hypothermia protocol.

NEURO: unresponsive, pupils intially on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]
were around 4mm sluggishly reactive to light, later were
pinpoint [**12-24**] fentanly. vestibulo-ocular reflex was negative.
rest of neurologic exam was deferred as patient was sedated and
paralyzed.
GCS score==3 (before paralysis)


Pertinent Results:
LGH EKG showed -- NSR @ 90, nml axis, borderline prolonged QTc,
Q in 2 3 aVF; >1mm ST elevations in 2,3,aVF, V4-6 w/ ST dep in
aVR, V1-2. R sided EKG showed ST elevations in V4.
.
[**Hospital1 18**] postcath EKG showed: resolved ST elevations w/ LVH like
pattern
.
.
Cardiac Cath:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
3. Mildly depressed cardiac index.
4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross and open the CX and RCA
occlusions
.
ECHO: EF 40-45%
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
with akinesis  of the basal to mid infero-lateral wall and basal
inferior wall. The aortic  root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 M w/ VFib arrest, STEMI s/p cath showing 3VD, none
intervened, w/ likely anoxic brain injury. Active issues during
this hospitalization include:
.
CARDIAC PROBLEMS:
# Rhythm/VFib arrest: Patient found in Vifib arrest in the
setting of STEMI; was shocked x2, was on lido gtt, and by time
arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] was in sinus rhythm.  Cooling/hypothermia
protocol started within 6 hrs of cardiac arrest and continued
for 24 hrs. After rewarming, he had no further arrhythmias.

# STEMI: He was noted to have ST segment elevations in
inferolateral leads, elevated CE's; STE resolved during PCI. He
was noted to have evidence of chronic 3VD but none intervened.
It was unclear whether his MI was acute or subacute given the
state of his coronary arteries seen in cath. Integrillin was
stopped around 90 min after cath [**12-24**] UGI bleed.  He was
maintained on ASA (dose reduced), statin, BB, ACEI, IV lopressor
PRN for SBP>160, HR>80, and plavix.  ECHO revealed EF 40-45%,
overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
with akinesis of the basal to mid infero-lateral wall and basal
inferior wall.
.
# Pump: He mildly depressed CI, elevated PCWP; however
maintaining BP well off the dopamine gtt, oxygenating well on
40% FiO2
.
# Neuro/Anoxic Brain injury/Seizure: On first day of admission,
patient was noted to have myoclonic jerking and posturing from
cerebral ischemia and seizure activity confirmed on EEG. CT
head/spine revealed no bleed/stroke and C-spine cleared. He was
started on dilantin and keppra for presumed status epilepticus.
At family meeting with neuro, family decided to try propofol
sedation to suppress seizure. While on high dose propofol,
dopamine and neosynephrine were used to maintain BP. After
withdrawal of propofol, pt continued to have seizure activity.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on field for airway
prtection. On second day of admission, patient developed either
CHF/flash pulm edema or ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]. PaO2/FiO2 was 266, CVP 10-14.
Ultimately, patient responded well to diuresis with improved
oxygenation.
.
# Hypotension: Intermittently require dopamine +/- levophed
while on sedation.
.
# Fever: LLL infiltrate, likelihood of aspiration pneumonia in
addition to other respiratory issues. He started Levo/Flagyl.
All Cx NGTD.
.
# Loose tooth: awaiting extraction from OMS
.
# Transaminitis: mildly elevated lactate, Transaminases; likely
from shock liver.
.
# UGIB: Initially had OP bleeding and coffee ground NG tube
output in the setting of getting ASA, Plavix, Heparin,
Integrillin. He remained hemodynamically stable, [**Hospital1 **] PPI,
bleeding decreased over hospital course, and he required no
transfusions
.
# Leukocytosis: likely from MI; now trending down.
.
# FEN: NPO, NG tube lavage
.
# PPx: PPI IV BID, heparin sq, HOB elevation
.
# Access: 2 piv, R SCL
.
