Brief Hospital Course:
[**9-19**] Mr.[**Known lastname 16905**] was taken to the operating room and underwent
Coronary Artery Bypass grafts x 4(Left Internal Mammary
Artery->Left Anterior Descending ,Saphenous Vein Grafted
->Obtuse Marginal ,Saphenous Vein Grafted -Posterior Descending
Artery ,Y-PLV)with Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **]. Cross clamp time=94 minutes.
Cardiopulmonary bypass time=132 minutes. Please refer to
Dr[**Doctor First Name **] operative report for further details. He was
transferred to the CVICU intubated, sedated,in critical but
stable condition. He awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without difficulty.  Beta blockade,statin, aspirin,
and diuresis was initiated. All lines and drains were
discontinued in a timely fashion. POD#1 he was transferred to
the step down unit for further monitoring. Physical Therapy was
consulted for evaluation of mobilization and strengthening.
Postoperatively he remained in his chronic atrial fibrillation
and Beta-Blockade was optimized to control the ventricular
response.  He refuses, as in the past, to take
Coumadin/anticoagulation despite the risks of potential
thrombus/emboli associated with atrial fibrillation. Temporary
pacing wires were removed on POD 3. On [**9-22**] he agreed to
allow ENT to biopsy his tongue mass and consult was requested.
Prior biopsy with ultrasound guidance of the right neck nodes
was reportedly negative for malignancy. Upon ENT's arrival,
however, Mr.[**Known lastname 16905**] then refused the biopsy. The remainder of
his postoperative course was essentially uneventful. He
continued to progress and Physical therapy recommended PT at
home. On POD#5 he was cleared by Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] for discharge to
home. All follow up appointments were advised.
