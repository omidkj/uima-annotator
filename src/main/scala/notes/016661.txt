Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
woman who came in for a diagnostic catheterization after
admission for a congestive heart failure exacerbation one
week earlier.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lisinopril 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Niacin 100 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Multivitamin.
5.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Insulin NPH 10 units q.a.m.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN, TETRACYCLINE, AZATHIOPRINE,
PROCARDIA.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The catheterization showed diffuse 3-vessel
coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary artery had
40% distal stenosis.  The left anterior descending artery was
diffusely diseased with serial 50% lesions.  The dominant
left circumflex artery had a diffusely disease mid vessel,
and the first posterior descending artery was normal.  The
origin of the bifurcating first obtuse marginal branch with a
60% stenosis, and there was a long diffuse 60% stenosis
distal to the previously placed stent with a long 90%
stenosis in the lower pole.

The patient was awaiting coronary artery bypass graft on the
floor when she went into flash pulmonary edema and was
intubated.  She was believed at that point not to be an
appropriate surgical candidate and was sent back to the
catheterization laboratory for a therapeutic catheterization.
Successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of
the bifurcating obtuse marginal branch was performed proximal
to the bifurcation but distal to the previously placed stent.

The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit where
she experienced a prolonged intubation due to persistent
sedation.  Neurology was consulted, and a magnetic resonance
imaging was done which was nondiagnostic secondary to motion
defect.  An electroencephalogram was done as well showing
nonspecific flowing pattern.  As no other organic causes were
found, the patient's prolonged sedation was felt to be a
result of a hypoxic brain injury.  All sedatives were held,
and one week after being unresponsive even to painful
stimuli, the patient began to awaken.  She was extubated
successfully and had rapid improvement.

During her intubation, the patient spiked a fever and was pan
cultured.  She was found to have sputum positive for
levofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  All other
cultures, including blood and urine, were otherwise negative.
The patient was initially started on vancomycin and
levofloxacin.  Vancomycin was discontinued after five days
when sensitivities returned.  The patient was to be continued
on levofloxacin orally for a 14-day course.

2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
