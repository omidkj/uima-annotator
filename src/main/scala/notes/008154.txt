Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Critical AS (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. It appears that the
right and left cusps are fused.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB:
Patient is atrial paced on no pressors.
A bio-prosthetic aortic valve is present. No aortic
regurgitation is appreciated. Mean aortic valve gradient is
8mmHg.
Trace MR, no TR.
Visualized portions of ascending aorta, arch and descending
aorta intact.
Overall left and right ventricular systolic function appears
normal. No visualized WMAs.

Post operatively she was admitted to the ICU intubated and
sedated. she awoke neuologically intact and weaned from the
ventilator and extubated. She was started on ASA, betablockers

temporary pacing wires were removed. She was evaluted by
physicaltherpay for strength and conditioning. On POD#4 she was
