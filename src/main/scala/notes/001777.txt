cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old with hx of HTN, DM, CHF, s/p pacemaker for
bradycardia, and high cholesterol who presented to [**Hospital 61311**] this morning after he experienced a loss of
conciousness. He was in his USOH until 8:30AM today when he had
brief loss of  conciousness. Though he was not aware of it, he
was told that  his speech was slurred and that his face was
asymmetric. He did not notice any weakness or numbness, denies
difficulty with speech, no vision changes. He did complain of
right arm pain. Denied CP, +mild SOB, An ambulance was called
and brought him to [**Location (un) **].

On arrival to OH ED, VS: 97.2 HR 60 BP 154/35 RR16 O2 Sat 95% on
room air. He was evaluated by neurology who found him to have a
"left homonymous hemianopsia" and "left hemiparesis". NCHCT was
done and was negative. While in the OH ER, he was found to have
positive troponin trop 1.13, CK 56 with EKG changes and was also
noted to have a BP discrepency between the right and left arm
with right arm being roughly 50mm mercury less than BP in left
arm. He was transfered here for cardiology workup and evaluation
for subclavian steal.

According to his family, his mental status has waxed and waned
throughout the day with periods of alterness and lethargy. He
has always been arousable and has been able to communicate a
coherent history at all times. They do note, however, that he
seems to be improved over the last several hours. They have also
noticed that his speech is slurred, he has a tendancy to look
only to the right, and has decreased spontaneous movement of his
left side (though they note that he has been able to move the
left side purposefully).
CT: Mild atrophy, ? hyperdense right MCA, but images out of
focus on re-prints.

At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, no CTA secondary to ARF. He was unable to do MRI
2/s pacemaker. Neurology :?right MCA territory(most likely
embolic vs Sc steal). Repeat NCHCT negative for bleed/edema. He
should have his BP kept in 200s and received 2u PRBC. EKG with
persistent lateral ST depression

On arrival to the floor, he was in respiratory distress
unresponsive to lasix and nitro gtt. He became unresponsive and
respiratory code was called. His initial ABG showed 7.18/67/67.
He was intubated and his BP was in 210/100 and P120. He was
given 10mg IV lopressor and nitro gtt.

CXR on admission -mild CHF, right pleural effusion, no focal
consolidation
CXR [**4-12**] -Worsening congestive heart failure.

Head CT [**3-29**]: Mild atrophy, ? hyperdense right MCA, but images
out of
focus on re-prints.

repeat Head CT [**3-31**]: R occip.parietal hypoattenuation, R
capsular attenuation.

non-invasive head studies: severely stenotic R and L ICA's;
severe vertebrobasilar stenosis

Renal u/s [**4-10**]: No hydronephrosis in either kidney. Left renal
calculus, which is nonobstructing. Slight increase in
echogenicity of both kidneys consistent with underlying renal
parenchymal disease. Small amount of free fluid in the abdomen
as well as a small right pleural effusion.

GB DRAINAGE,INTRO PERC TRANHEP BIL US  [**4-8**]: Successful placement
of a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube. A sample of the bile was
immediately sent to microbiology for Gram stain and culture.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**4-7**]:Acute
cholecystitis, with distended, sludge and stone-filled
gallbladder and wall edema.

[**Month/Day (4) **] [**4-5**]: No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle
(evaluated with Definity).  The apex is hypokinetic and the
basal inferior/inferoseptal segments are aneurysmal. Compared to
the prior study of [**2174-4-4**], left ventricular systolic function
appears similar.

[**Date Range **] [**4-4**]: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity  size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately  depressed. Resting regional
wall motion abnormalities include inferobasal  aneurysm with
inferolateral akinesis and apical akinesis.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic  function is normal.  4.The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. Trace aortic  regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild mitral
regurgitation  seen.  6.There is no pericardial effusion.  7.
There appears to be a circular mass in the LV, consistent with
an LV thrombus. Would recommend Definity contrast to beeter view
the mass. Compared with the findings of the prior tape of
[**2174-3-29**], images were equally limited but appears unchanged,
though LV mass not previously seen.

[**Date Range **] [**3-29**]: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.

3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  4. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  03/29:1. No evidence of retroperitoneal
hematoma.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.3. Two small
high-attenuation foci in the right kidney which may represent
hyperdense cysts. 4. Tiny nonobstructing left renal calculus.

Carotid u/s [**3-30**]:On the left, there is significant plaque with
an 80% to 99% cervical carotid stenosis. On the right, there is
evidence of an intracranial carotid artery occlusion. In
addition, there is a significant disease in the right subclavian
artery, based on waveforms.

C.CATH Study Date of [**3-29**]: 1. Coronary angiography of this
right dominant circulation demonstrated three vessel coronary
artery disease.  The LMCA had no angiograpically apparent
disease.  The LAD had an origin 70% stenosis with moderate
calcification.  There were serial 50% stenosis through out the
vessel with total occlusion in the apical segment.  There was
diffuse diagonal disease with 60-70% stenosis.  The LCX had a
widely patent stent proximally with 30% instent restenosis.
Major OM had 60% stenosis prior to bifurcation.  The RCA was
totally occluded proximally with left to right collaterals
filling the distal vessel. 2. Left ventriculography was
deferred. 3. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated
left and right sided pressures with mRAP of 11 mmHg and mPCWP of
14 mmHg.  There was mild pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 36
mmHg and mPAP of 24 mmHg. Cardiac output and cardiac index were
preserved at 5.9 L/min and 3.4 L/min/M2, respectively. 4. Due to
blood pressure discrepancy in the right arm, subclavian
angiography was performed to determine if vertebral
