Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Location (un) 620**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated and extubated on [**2168-9-2**]


History of Present Illness:
59 year old female with extensive PMH including A Fib on sotalol
and coumadin, sick sinus s/p dual-chamber pacemaker, CVA, was at
physical therapy when she became short of breath and felt as if
she were having an asthma attack. She presented to the [**Location (un) 620**]
ED and was found to be hypoxic 60% RA and was consequently
intubated. Unfortunately, there is no documentation of
presenting vitals, presenting compliants or intubation
procedure. EKG demonstrated ST elevation V1, V2 and patient was
consequently transferred for STEMI. Prior to transfer patient
received Ativan 2 g IV, Versed 2g, Dopamine drip, Lasix 40 mg
IVP, Heparin bolus and drip, Aspirin 300 PR. Patient's vitals
ranged from 71-100/43-60, P 71-84, O2 sat 99% vent.

EKG prior to transfer showed ST elevations normalized and
demonstrated baseline repolorization changes from LVH. To eval
hypotension patient had right heart cath which demonstrated
normal/hyperdynamic cardiac output (see results below) and no
suggestion of cardiogenic shock. Patient was admited to CCU for
concern of sepsis. Per report patient had positive urine culture
for gram negative rods at [**Location (un) 620**]. Due to extensive allergies to
antibiotics the patient was given Gentamicin 450mg IV in cath
lab.

In addition, her CXR was consistent with multifocal pneumonia
vs. ARDS. While in the CCU her levophed was weaned. Her swan
catheter was removed and a triple lumen was placed. Vancomycin
was added, in addition to Aztreonam for atypical coverage.

In addition, echo showed a mass compressing her IVC, RUQ US
showed a cystic mass in her liver.

Past Medical History:
Left MCA territory embolic infarct, likely of cardioembolic
etiology in [**2166-5-16**]
Atrial fibrillation on sotalol and coumadin
CAD - MI [**2155**] @ age 44, [**2156**], and NSTEMI in [**2164**] (Trop T 0.06)
Sick sinus syndrome status post dual-chamber pacemaker
MVR
Hyperlipidemia
Diabetes mellitus, type 2
Obesity
Hypertension
Asthma
Ostructive sleep apnea on BIPAP
Mild pulmonary HTN 36/18 on cath in [**8-21**]

Social History:
Per OMR - Social history is significant for the absence of
current tobacco use. She smoked for one year at the age of 21.
There is no history of alcohol abuse.


Family History:
Per OMR - Her father died of CAD in his 50's, he had his first
MI at age 41. She has multiple younger brothers with "heart
problems."

STUDIES:

Right Heart Cath [**2168-8-31**]
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right heart
filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 14 mmHg and moderate pulmonary
hypertension
with a PASP of 40/17 mmHg. There was normal left sided filling
pressure
with a PCWP mean of 17 mmHg. The cardiac index was normal at 2.5

L/min/m2. Systemic blood pressure was low by non-invasive
measurement
requiring pressor support.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Hypotension requiring pressors with preserved cardiac index.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

TTE [**2168-9-1**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is a 5.0 x 4.4-cm heterogenous
(cystic) subdiaphragmatic echodensity abutting the inferior vena
cava, which appears to be extrahepatic (cine loops #56-60),
etiology unknown.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild diastolic LV dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Extracardiac cystic structure, as described above.

Initial ECG - Atrial paced rhythm. Intraventricular conduction
