Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 28286**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening anginal symptoms

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
c. cath

History of Present Illness:
82-year-old female with history of CAD s/p MI in [**2117**], angina,
history of stent to LAD in [**2140**], HTN, HL, PVD, AAA s/p repair,
CEA, CKD (Cr 2.5), severe pulmonary hypertension, HIT, history
of PE, oxygen-dependent COPD presents in setting of increasing
dyspnea and chest discomfort to CCU for aspirin desensitization
in setting of history of aspirin sensitive asthma and pre-cath
hydration.

Patient was seen in clinic on [**2149-2-27**] with worsening dyspnea on
exertion and chest discomfort for approximately 6 months now. Of
note, she was hospitalized a year ago at [**Hospital3 3765**] for
COPD exacerbation, possible pneumonia, and possible heart
failure episode. CXR on [**10-23**] noted new left pleural effusion
that has persisted. She also noticed over the past 3-4 months in
addition to shortness of breath, anginal-type symptoms. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2257**] had evaluated her in [**Month (only) 956**] and felt that she could
be having ischemic symptoms and recommended cardiac
catheterization; however, there was concern about chronic kidney
disease and risk of dye load causing permanent renal damage.
PFTs at the time were stable. She also has a small left pleural
effusion that was unchanged. It was felt that her lung disease
would not explain the degree of symptoms that she is currently
having. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2257**] (cardiology) was also concerned about her
symptoms. It was discussed whether or not she would want to
proceed with a cardiac catheterization and risk of additional to
her kidneys from contrast

For her symptoms, her shortness of breath occurs with almost any
type of activity and rapidly followed by severe discomfort in
the chest relieved by nitroglycerin especially with walking long
distances. With continued rest, her pain completely resolves.
She is however able to ambulate around her living quarters
without symptoms most of the time. She describes her symptoms as
central non-radiating chest discomfort that is "frightening"
with associated shortness of breath lasting minutes.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2257**] had increased her metoprolol to 240 mg PO qD but the
patient is only taking metoprolol SR 150 mg PO qD. Her
isosorbide had also been increased. Her last episode of
discomfort was the day prior to admission.

After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33746**], it was planned to admit her to
the CCU for aspirin desensitization in setting of history of
aspirin-sensitive asthma and hydration prior to cath.

She has been on warfarin for possible prior history of PE with
last dose on [**2149-3-28**].

On the floor, patient is resting comfortably in bed with no
complaints.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope. She sleep on two pillows on an incline and is unable
to lay flat. This has been a chronic issue that she attributes
to COPD.
