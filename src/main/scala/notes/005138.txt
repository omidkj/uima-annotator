ECHO:

The left atrium is markedly dilated. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present
in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-40%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending
aorta is markedly dilated The descending thoracic aorta is
moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-14**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8923**],[**Known firstname **] was admitted on [**6-19**] with AAA. He agreed to

surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well
without any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, he was sent to the CVICU he was then
extubated and transferred to the VICU for further stabilization
and monitoring.

While in the VICU he received monitored care. When stable he was
delined. His diet was advanced. A PT consult was obtained. When
he was stabilized from the acute setting of post operative care,
he was transferred to floor status

On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. He progressed with physical therapy to improve her
strength and mobility. He continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. He was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility in stable condition.
