Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower extremity edema; tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG
and prior CVA who presents with lower extremity edema and
tachypnea.

Per patient and son (who translated in Italian), the patient was
feeling well until approximately one week prior to admission
when he began noting increasing LE edema.  He has also had
insomnia, waking every 30 minutes or so.  He uses one pillow at
night; this has been stable.  It is unclear on history if he has
PND - he describes feeling "suffocated" at times though he
doesn't wake up acutely short of breath.  More often than not,
he simply wakes up to so his wife can make food for him.

Given these symptoms, he presented to his PCP who referred him
to the ED.

In the ED, initial vitals showed BP of 205/74, HR 65, RR 24 with
96% on room air.  BP remained >190 systolic and was given SL
nitro x3, aspirin and 40 IV lasix.  After this, noted to be
breathing more comfortably though RR remained elevated.  As the
BP did not improve, nitro gtt was started and increased 11.8
with a BP of 156/82 at the time of transfer.

On review of systems, he reports a prior stroke with left-sided
weakness.  No history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Also
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.  Denies any dietary
indiscretion or weight gain.  Per son, he will frequently not
take his antihypertensives.  Has nocturia x4-5 per night though
denies any fevers or dysuria.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG ([**2173**]; old): RBBB with LAFB; old inferior MI
EKG (admission): Similar to old.

Lung Scan ([**1-24**]): 1. The above findings are consistent with low
probability of pulmonary embolus.
2. Small airways disease.

CXR ([**1-24**]):  The lungs are clear. There is no evidence of
pneumonia or
congestive heart failure. The cardiac and mediastinal contours
are stable in configuration. The patient is status post median
sternotomy. There are multiple old healed rib fractures. The
visualized osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable with no
evidence of acute fractures. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax or pleural effusions.

LENIs ([**1-24**]): No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.

TTE ([**1-25**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of
the distal inferior wall, distal septum and apex. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction. Probable
diastolic dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation.  Mildly
dilated aortic root and ascending aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-1-26**],
the basal to mid inferior hypokinesis and apical lateral
hypokinesis have improved. The other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  [**Age over 90 **]M with history of CAD, CHF who presents
with LE edema and tachypnea.

# CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, DIASTOLIC and SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON
CHRONIC:  Prior echo with EF of 45% and LVH.  Presented this
hospitalization with right heart > left heart failure.  The
right heart failure seems subacute. Given his hypertension to
the high 180's to 190's in the ED, this may have been the
percipitant to his acute heart failure.  He was treated with 40
mg of lasix IV twice and diuresed over 2 L.  He was continued on
his [**Last Name (un) **] and metoprolol.  By the morning of discharge his legs
looked much less edematous and his tachypnea had resolved.  A
TTE showed an EF of 45-50% with mild focal LV systolic
dysfunction, probable diastolic dysfunction and mild aortic
regurgitation.  When compared with the prior study of
[**2174-1-26**], the basal to mid inferior hypokinesis and apical
lateral hypokinesis were improved. The other findings are
similar.  His home po
