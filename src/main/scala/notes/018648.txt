Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Imitrex / Biaxin

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
rigid bronchoscopy, IR embolization of bleeding pulmonary
vessels

History of Present Illness:
65 y/oM with stage IV lung CA on home 2L [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH
with hemoptysis x 1 week and resultant Hct drop from baseline 28
to 17. Patient first started coughing up dark clots of blood on
Friday; states last hemoptysis was 1 day prior to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**], and was about a tablespoon of blood. Patient had not
required mechanical ventilation and was saturating well on room
air in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient also c/o dyspnea on mild
exertion. Of note, dyspnea has been a longterm complaint and
patient was recently admitted for removal of y-stent in
[**Month (only) 359**](first placed 2 mo ago). Per report, OP oncologist who
did not want to repeat bronchoscopy.
.
Patient also with recent chemo of [**Doctor Last Name **]/gemcitabine (last dose
on [**2100-10-24**]), and had radiation to lung in [**2100-8-11**].
Patient also c/o rib and right hip pain. In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], radiographs
revealed new lytic lesions in ribs and new right femur lytic
lesion.
.
Finally, per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient also c/o dysphagia x several days and
states he can't take liquids+solids. The [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team was concerned
that the large mass in lungs may be compressing the esophagus,
so GI consulted for feeding tube. Also with 75 pound weight
loss.
.
Per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] note, at OSH, transfused 2 UpRBC on [**2100-10-28**]. CT scan
of chest no active source of hemorrhage or PE. Given concern for
large volume bleed, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and treatment.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **], initial VS: 97.9 100 113/72 18 100% 4L NC,
able to be weaned to 99% on RA. Physical exam notable for
scattereed rales and trace guiac positive rectal exam. Repeat
Hct had risen appropriate to 25, and Hct has been stable
throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
.
Because IP wanted to use a rigid bronch to see if they can
coagulate and localize source of bleeding, patient was
transferred West for OR.
During bronchoscopy, found to be tumor invasion into both left
and right proximal [**Last Name (LF) 87542**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] invasion into the carina. IP
able to obtain hemostasis/coagulate much of it, but areas are
still oozing and will need IR angioembolization. Patient
intubated in OR and comes to MICU intubated.

IMAGING:
CT Chest [**11-3**]
1. No aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism.
2. Persistent tumor encasing the posterior mediastinum, carina
and right
hilum. The overall extent of this tumor appears to have
decreased from the
previous study with resultant improved patency of the airways
and resolution
of right upper lobe and lower lobe atelectasis.
3. New bilateral lytic rib lesions consistent with metastatic
disease. There
is also a new pathologic left posterior eighth rib fracture.
4. Tumor involvement in the posterior mediastinum is inseparable
from the
esophagus and there is a large volume of ingested material seen
in the
proximal esophagus. This finding raises concern for aspiration.
5. Emphysema.
6. Unchanged thickening of both adrenal glands.
.
Bone Scan: [**11-5**]
IMPRESSION: Multiple osseous metastatic lytic foci involving the
thoracic ribsthe right femoral neck with associated pathologic
fracture involvingthe
left posterior 8th rib as can be correlated on recent
CT/radiographs.
.
CT PELVIS: [**11-5**]
IMPRESSION:
 1. Innumerable lytic lesions throughout the sacrum, bilateral
iliac bones,
and proximal femurs.
2. The largest lesion is in the right intertrochanteric region
of the femur
which is not completely imaged. There is rarefaction of the
medial aspect of the right femur medially at the site of the
lesion which is at risk for
pathologic fracture.
3. Interval development of ascites in the abdomen.
.
CT CHEST [**11-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Overall progression of subcarinal and paraesophageal mass
with occlusion
of the distal unstented portions of the right middle and lower
lobe bronchi.
2. Subtotal occlusion of the esophageal stent in its mid portion
with
associated distention of the proximal esophagus.
3. Marked interval enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions
and associated compressive atelectasis at the lower lobes.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Metastatic Lung Cancer. During this hospitalization the was
tumor found to be increasingly aggressive in nature with
continued growth, despite active chemotherapy. Continued growth
resulted in esophageal compression as well as invasion into the
bronchial tr
