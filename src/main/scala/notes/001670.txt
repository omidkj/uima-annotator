Admission Date:  [**2135-7-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2135-7-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**2060-4-27**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Status post left carotid stent on
Neo-Synephrine.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old gentleman
(with past medical history of coronary artery disease, CABG
(5 years ago), atrial fibrillation, ejection fraction of 30%,
peripheral vascular disease) status post left internal
carotid artery stent on Neo-Synephrine for systolic blood
pressure goal of 120-160 mm Hg.  The patient has a history of
visual blurring with standing.  No vertigo or dizziness.
Patient had 2-3 episodes of hemiparesis (face, arm, and leg),
and left sided numbness 2-3x.  It was decided to place a
stent in the ICA because of a progressive left sided lesion
to 95% with symptoms.

In the Catheterization Laboratory on [**2135-7-11**], the patient
underwent left ICA stent.  The findings intraoperatively were
a 95% [**Doctor First Name 3098**] lesion, 40% [**Country **] lesion.  After the stent, there
was a 10% residual stenosis on the left with ipsilateral
filling of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**].  Secondary to intractable hypotension,
the patient was placed on a Neo-Synephrine drip with a goal
systolic blood pressure of 120-160.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for chest pressure, discomfort,
shortness of breath, or dizziness.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married, lives in [**Location **],
[**State 350**].  Is a machinist.  Does not smoke.  Has not had
a drink of alcohol since [**2116**].

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.4.  Blood
pressure on Neo-Synephrine 155/56.  Heart rate 56.
Respiratory rate 20.  Oxygenation 99% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  General:  Patient appears younger than stated age
in no apparent distress, lying on back.  Alert and oriented
times three with prompting.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes dry.
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Neck is
supple.  Neck veins are flat.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate,
S1 greater than S2 at the apex, 2/6 systolic murmur at the
right base, 1+ carotid bruit on the right, nondisplaced point
of maximal impulse.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen is nontender and nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds, soft.  Extremities:  Right femoral
sheath clean, dry, and intact, 2+ dorsalis pedis, posterior
tibialis, and radial pulses bilaterally.  No clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through
XII are grossly intact.  Motor is [**5-9**] bilaterally.  Sensation
is grossly intact.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus
rhythm at 75 beats per minute, left anterior fascicular
block, poor R-wave progression.

INR of 1.5.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.7, chloride 106, bicarb
25, BUN 28, creatinine 1.4, glucose 84, hemoglobin A1C of
7.0.

Catheterization on [**2135-7-11**]:  A stent was placed in the left
internal carotid artery, the dimensions of which were 8.0 x40
mm.  The final residual is 10% with normal flow and no
dissections.  Occlusion time seven minutes 0 seconds.  The
patient remained neurologically intact throughout the
procedure.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the
CCU from the Catheterization Laboratory, as he was on a
Neo-Synephrine drip.

ISSUES:
1. Intractable hypotension:  The patient's Neo-Synephrine
drip was at 0.67 mcg/kg/minute on [**2135-7-12**].  Multiple
attempts at weaning with the systolic blood pressure goal of
120-160 were unsuccessful.  The patient remained on
Neo-Synephrine until [**2135-7-16**], and maintained a systolic
blood pressure in the 120s-130s.  Of note, all of his blood
pressure medications had been held.

2. Bradycardia:  The patient's bradycardia was thought to be
secondary to heightened vagal tone.  His heart rate remained
in the 40s throughout the majority of his inpatient stay.  On
the day of discharge, his heart rate was normal sinus rhythm
in the 60s.

3. Anemia:  The patient's nadir of his hematocrit was 27.6.
He was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells on
[**2135-7-12**].  It was presumed that the blood loss was secondary
to his catheterization.  The patient received an additional
unit of packed red blood cells on [**2135-7-13**] to bring him to a
hematocrit of 33.3.  The patient tolerated the transfusions
without difficulty.

4. Transient ischemic attack ?:  The patient had an episode
of visual disturbance on [**2135-7-12**].  He described it as a
bilateral blurring/amaurosis fugax.  The patient was also
transiently unresponsive.  This episode lasted approximately
10-15 seconds.  A neurological examination showed no motor or
sensory deficiency, no cranial nerve.

A STAT noncontrast head CT scan within one hour of symptom
onset demonstrated extensive evidence of chronic white
matter, small vessel ischemia with no other findings to
suggest acute or subacute infarction or hemorrhage.

The cause of the patient's transient vision changes and
unresponsiveness were not fully elucidated.  A Neurological
consult was obtained with no additional recommendations.

5. Diabetes:  The patient was placed on insulin-sliding scale
with qid fingersticks.

6. Agitation:  The patient became increasingly agitated
throughout his hospital course.  He was quite frustrated with
his clinical course.  He was noted surreptitiously be taken
clorazepate from home and was continued on his clorazepate
7.5 tid po regimen with good effect.  The patient was helped
markedly with frequent reorientation to person, place, and
time and reassurance and explanation regarding his clinical
course.  It was recommended that BuSpar be tried as an
outpatient for the patient's anxiety disorder as Tranxene is
a long-acting benzodiazepine, which the patient was taking on
a prn basis.

7. Activity:  The patient had a Physical Therapy evaluation
on [**2135-7-14**], which determined that he was stable to be
discharged home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  On the date of discharge, the
patient's vital signs were as follows:  Temperature 98.0,
blood pressure 156/60, respirations 14-19, heart rate in the
60s, and 98% on room air.  Patient had been completely weaned
off Neo-Synephrine and was asymptomatic and hemodynamically
stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Plavix 75 mg one po q day.
2. Coumadin 1 po q day, adjusted to INR.
3. Aspirin 81 mg tablet one po q day.
4. Atorvastatin 10 mg one po q day.
5. Clorazepate 3.75 tablets two tablets po tid.
6. Metformin 850 mg tablet one po tid.
7. Avandia 4 mg tablet one po q day.
8. Amaryl 4 mg tablet one po bid.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to go to [**Hospital Ward Name **] Four on
Monday, [**7-18**] for blood pressure check at 10 am.  The patient
was to followup for a vascular study on [**2135-9-13**] at 2:30 pm,
and follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2135-9-13**] at 3 pm,
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2207**].  The patient was advised to return to the
Emergency Room or call 911 with any new symptom
