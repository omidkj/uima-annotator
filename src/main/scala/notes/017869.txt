hypotension and started on vanc cefepime empirically for

mental status (AAOx3, able to recall the days events). Last
night his family notes that he was increasingly somnolent, and

He initially was somnolent, only responding to deny pain, cough,
dyspena and dysuria. In the ER was noted to be somnolent
initially, his mental status improved with IV fluids however
when he spiked a temp to 100.9 his blood pressure dropped to
77/48, mentating well at that time. He was given 1LNS and his
SBP improved to the 90's, however his blood pressure dropped
again to 82/40, so he was given a second liter and started on
levophed. He had a LLE ultrasound that was negative for DVT, RUQ
US which showed a 6mm CBD, no cholecystitis, a CT head with no
acute process and a CXR with no evidence of pneumonia. He was
given vancomycin for presumed cellulitis and empiric cefepime

hemorrhage,
discrete masses, mass effect or shift of normally midline
structures. The
ventricles and sulci appear slightly prominent, consistent with
age-related involutional changes. Minimal periventricular and
