with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft, end stage renal disease,
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroid,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease.
She was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation
of chest pain.  The patient had a coronary artery bypass
graft to multiple vessels, left anterior descending coronary
artery, obtuse marginal two, obtuse marginal in [**2130**] with
stents placed in the obtuse marginal one, left circumflex,
left main in [**2132-6-28**] and [**2133-2-28**].  On the day
of admission the patient had chest pain radiating to the jaw
with orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient
went to the outside hospital and received some nitroglycerin
there and became hypotensive and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] and found to have an
myocardial infarction by positive troponin.  The Coronary
Care Unit team was consulted.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile.
Heart rate 62.  Blood pressure 90/28.  O2 sat 98% on room
air.  Respiratory rate 18.  The patient was an obese elderly
female lying flat in no acute distress.  HEENT anicteric.
Pink conjunctiva.  Mucous membranes are moist.  No JVD.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  2 out of 6 systolic
ejection murmur.  No carotid bruits.  Respirations clear to
auscultation with a very poor respiratory effort.  Abdomen is
obese, distended, slightly tympanic with positive bowel
sounds, but nontender.  Extremities were warm with 2+ pulses
and 1+ pedal edema.

LABORATORY FINDINGS AT THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White blood
cell count was 9.6, H&H 12.7 and 35.6.  The patient had a CK
of 18, CKMB of less then .5, index 2.8, troponin .06.  PT
13.3, INR of 1.2, PTT 22, with normal electrolytes.  Repeat
laboratories at [**Hospital1 69**] showed a
white blood cell count of 16, electrolytes within normal
limits.  PT 14.2, PTT 48.5, INR 1.3.  Liver function tests
all within normal limits.  Troponin of .5.  Electrocardiogram
showed an irregularly irregular rhythm.  The patient was in
atrial fibrillation with normal axis.  No Q waves, ST
depressions in V2 through V6 with an incomplete right bundle
branch block.  It was read as a nonspecific STT wave changes.
Chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure.  CTA of the
chest was negative for PE and pneumothorax and just showed
calcified coronary arteries and aorta.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was sent to the catheterization
laboratory for reperfusion.  The patient received Integrilin
for 18 hours and placed on Plavix 75 mg q.d. for nine months.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated with vomiting
and severe abdominal pain with elevated amylase and lipase
status post catheterization consistent with pancreatitis.
There were no further cardiovascular complications and the
patient was transferred to the medicine team.  CT of the
abdomen then revealed gallstones with no dilation of the
biliary tree.  Ultrasound showed gallstones in the
gallbladder.  MRCP was deferred due to recent stent and
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was not
indicated since this was the first incident of pancreatitis.
The pancreatitis resolved by date of discharge.  The patient
was kept NPO and was gently hydrated with intravenous fluids
until discharge.  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay was also
complicated by a decreased platelet count that resolved with
the discontinuation of heparin.  Heparin induced
thrombocytopenia antibody titers were pending on the day of
discharge.  Elevated INR and macrocytic anemia were also
noted and should be evaluated in the outpatient setting.
They were not contributory to her hospital stay.  The patient
resumed peritoneal dialysis on [**2133-9-16**].  The patient was also
noted to have a skin wound or burn on the back that was due
to a heating pad that she left for too long.  The patient's
wound was not infected, but healing slowly and was treated
with neosporin ointment.  The patient was also found to have
an elevated TSH indicating insufficient Levothyroxine and was
discharged on an increased dose of levothyroxine to be
followed up as an outpatient.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Cardiac catheterization on [**2133-9-7**].
