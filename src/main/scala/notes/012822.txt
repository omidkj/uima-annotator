Admission Date:  [**2169-5-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-5-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2116-12-13**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress and right-sided
weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male with
a history of Tourette's, depression, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, right bundle-branch block, and a history of a
myocardial infarction at 34 years of old presenting with
shortness of breath and right-sided weakness.

The patient originally presented at 1:30 a.m. to [**Hospital 8641**]
Hospital.  There, a head computed tomography was performed
which was reportedly normal.  A D-dimer was elevated as well
as troponin.  A chest x-ray was done which was thought to be
consistent with a pneumonia.  The patient was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for further workup
of an acute stroke.

In the Emergency Department, the patient had a computed
tomography angiogram positive for a pulmonary embolus.  Head
computed tomography was repeated which showed a large apical
mass.  He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
monitoring of his pulmonary embolus and acute stroke.

According to the patient and his family, he had been feeling
generally ill since [**Month (only) 956**] with cough, hemoptysis,
congestion, nausea, and vomiting.  Over the past three prior
to admission he had increased shortness of breath, left calf
pain, weakness, lethargy, headache, and neck discomfort.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  History of Tourette's (with depression and
obsessive-compulsive disorder).
2.  Right bundle-branch block.
3.  History of myocardial infarction at the age of 34.
4.  History of Bell's palsy.
5.  Hyperglycemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home include
atenolol, Seroquel, and Prozac.

ALLERGIES:  .....................

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with prostate cancer and colon
cancer.  Mother with scleroderma, congestive heart failure,
and history deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus (on
chronic Coumadin).  Daughter with a history of three
miscarriages.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his girlfriend since [**2145**]
([**Name2 (NI) **]) who is also his health care proxy (telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 54972**]).  He has a 35-year to 40-pack-year smoking
history.  He quit alcohol use one year ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 100.5,
his heart rate was 92, his blood pressure was 122/81, his
respiratory rate was 30 to 40, and he was saturating 100% on
3 liters nasal cannula.  In general, he was an obese male
using his abdominal and accessory muscles for breathing.  He
was talking in 1-word to 2-word sentences with an expressive
aphasia and difficulty word finding.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed the extraocular movements
were intact.  The mucous membranes were dry.  There was no
lymphadenopathy.  Jugular venous pressure could not be
assessed.  Heart revealed normal first heart sounds and
second heart sounds with distant heart sounds.  The lungs had
bilateral rhonchi.  The abdomen was obese, soft, and
nontender.  There were positive bowel sounds.  Extremities
had 1+ pitting edema on the left.  Neurologic examination
revealed 0/5 strength in the right upper extremity and right
lower extremity.  Strength was [**6-14**] in the left upper
extremity and left lower extremity.  Normal sensation
throughout.  Right-sided facial droop.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
a white blood cell count of 14.7 (with 83% neutrophils and
12% lymphocytes), his hematocrit was 39, and his platelets
were 133.  Chemistries were within normal limits with normal
renal function.  His INR was 1.4.  Initial set of troponins
with a creatine kinase of 184, troponin T of 1.05.  Liver
function tests were within normal limits.  Arterial blood gas
on mask ventilation showed 7.36/43/133.  Repeat arterial
blood gas on 4 liters nasal cannula showed 7.35/42/73.  His
lactate was 0.7 (down from 1.5).

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Lower extremity Doppler studies
showed a deep venous thrombosis in the left popliteal vein.

A chest x-ray showed a right apical lung mass with extensive
mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with patchy left lower
lobe atelectasis and increased interstitial markings
diffusely, suggestive of lymphangitic spread.

A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no atrial septal defect
or patent foramen [**Last Name (LF) 43369**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] left ventricular ejection
fraction of greater than 55%, anterior space fat pad, no wall
motion abnormalities.

A computed tomography of the head with contrast showed a
subacute left frontal lobe infarction.

A computed tomography angiogram of the chest showed right
lower lobe thrombus in the segmental branch and a 4.4-cm X
4.9-cm mass in the right apex of the lung, positive
lymphadenopathy, and patchy opacification in the right upper
lobe, with atelectasis in the left lower base, and a fatty
liver.

A carotid ultrasound showed no stenosis of the bilateral
carotids.

An x-ray of the orbit showed no metallic foreign bodies.

An electrocardiogram with sinus tachycardia at 120, with Q
waves in leads II, III, and aVF.  There was a
intraventricular conduction delay with a right bundle
morphology with ST depressions in V3 and T wave inversions in
V1.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was sent to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for better monitoring of his respiratory
status.  He was in acute respiratory distress on admission
and was placed on noninvasive positive pressure  ventilation
for a brief period of time.  His shortness of breath
symptomatically improved, and he required 3 liters by nasal
cannula when he was stable.  His lungs were rhonchorous
bilaterally.  He was placed on a heparin drip for his
pulmonary embolism as well as his deep venous thrombosis.

A computerized axial tomography was also positive for a right
upper lobe apical mass which was nonobstructive.  This was
suspicious for a cancer; either lung cancer or a lymphoma.

The Pulmonary Service was consulted, and sputum cytology was
sent.  There was an increased risk for recurrent pulmonary
emboli given the patient's deep venous thrombosis if the
patient was to be taken off of his heparin drip for a
bronchoscopy.  Therefore, a temporary inferior vena cava
filter was placed by Interventional Radiology on [**2169-5-9**].  The patient will be taken for a bronchoscopy on [**2169-5-12**] for a biopsy of his right upper lobe apical mass.  He
will follow up with Hematology/Oncology for the results.

The patient's partial thromboplastin time goal for his
pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis is between 60
and 80.  He will be started on Coumadin and continued on
heparin drip status post bronchoscopy until his INR is above
2 for greater than 48 hours, overlapping with heparin.

The patient was treated empirically for a postobstructive
pneumonia as the patient was febrile on admission.  He was
given levofloxacin and Flagyl for a 7-day course.  All sputum
cultures grew moderate oropharyngeal flora.

2.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient sustained two ischemic
events causing a right-sided paresis as well as a Broca
aphasia.  His speech continued to improve during his hospital
course with speech therapy.  He also received physical
therapy and occupational therapy.

A repeat head computed tomography showed normal evolution of
his two ischemic strokes in the left frontal parasagittal
area as well as the left occipital temporal area.  There was
no sign of hemorrhagic transformation.

A transthoracic echocardiogram with bubble study was
performed to assess for intracardiac shunt, and was negative
for atrial septal defect or patent foramen [**Year (4 digits) 43369**].  Carotid
ultrasounds were also performed to look for an embolic source
of his strokes and were negative for stenoses.

A magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography
could not be performed during this hospital stay secondary to
the patient's agitation and inability to lay still for a long
period of time.  The patient was to follow up with Neurology
as an outpatient by Dr.
