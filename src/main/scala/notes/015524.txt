HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 59 year old female was
referred in by her primary care physician to the hospital and
admitted to the medical service on [**2150-12-2**], presenting
with increasing dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity
edema.  She had a known history of breast cancer with
moderate severe aortic stenosis.  She was feeling fine until
she developed symptoms approximately two weeks prior to
admission after a trip to New [**Country 6679**].  She felt she had some
unusual chest sensations and no dyspnea at that time but she
went to her son again three weeks ago and had noticed
increasing dyspnea, as well as palpitations with walking but
no lower extremity edema.  Then in the prior two weeks to
admission, she developed some orthopnea and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea over one week.  She also noticed she had a
ten pound weight gain in one week and decreased urine output
times one week with dark urine and increased thirst.  Her
primary care physician noted her increasing lower extremity
edema.  She had no chest pain at that time and was admitted
into the hospital on the medical service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Breast cancer, stage II hormone
positive, status post lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation
therapy with chemotherapy in [**2149-1-1**], to [**2149-6-1**], with
Adriamycin, Cytoxan and Taxol, and radiation therapy [**2149-7-1**], to [**2149-8-1**], thirty-three visits.
Bicuspid aortic valve.  Prior echocardiogram at [**Hospital1 346**] in [**2150-12-2**], revealed mild to
moderate aortic stenosis with two plus aortic insufficiency
and one plus mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.  At the
time, she had a peak aortic valve gradient of 43 mmHg and a
mean of 28 mmHg.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was treated by the medical
service and cardiology for her congestive heart failure that
she presented with in preparation for cardiac catheterization
and repeat echocardiogram.  She was followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], her primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was diuresed
and ultimately received echocardiogram on [**2150-12-8**], which
showed global left ventricular hypokinesis, bilateral atrial
enlargement, moderate aortic stenosis with two plus aortic
insufficiency, one to two plus mitral regurgitation, and
depressed right ventricular function.  Cardiac
catheterization was performed on [**2150-12-4**], which showed 30
percent left main lesion, two plus mitral regurgitation, left
ventricular ejection fraction of 20 percent with severe
diffuse hypokinesis and severe aortic stenosis with a valve
area of 0.5 centimeter squared, a peak gradient of 45 mmHg.
The patient additionally had low cardiac output in the
catheterization laboratory.  The patient was referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of cardiothoracic surgery for aortic valve
replacement with a question of mitral valve replacement
versus repair.  She was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7625**] of
cardiothoracic surgery who noted her prior history of
bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse and her history
of left breast cancer, status post chemotherapy, radiation
therapy and surgery with Adriamycin.  Of note, the patient
also had left upper extremity lymphedema from her prior
lumpectomy and axillary node dissection.  The patient was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7625**] who noted her prior medical history.

On examination, she was in no apparent distress but slightly
short of breath in bed.  She had mild jugular venous
distention.  The heart was regular rate and rhythm with a
grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best at the left
upper sternal border and apex.  Her lungs were clear
bilaterally without any wheezes, rhonchi or rales.  She had a
soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen.  Her extremities were
without any cyanosis, clubbing or edema but her hands
bilaterally were slightly cyanotic.  Her neurological
examination was nonfocal.  She had two plus bilateral carotid
pulses, no palpable radial pulses, and one plus bilateral
femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
pulses.

Preoperative laboratories were as follows:  White blood cell
count 8.1, hematocrit 30.4, platelet count 403,000.
Prothrombin time 14.9, partial thromboplastin time 24.8, INR
1.4.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.6, chloride 103, creatinine
1.0, blood sugar 119.  Prothrombin time 33.9, partial
thromboplastin time 57, INR 0.9.  CK 141, troponin less than
0.01.  Hepatitis antibody was negative.  Chest x-ray showed
cardiomegaly.  Additional laboratories were as follows:  ALT
339, AST 173, alkaline phosphatase 67, total bilirubin 0.9.
Preoperative electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation.
Preoperative gallbladder ultrasound showed a right pleural
effusion and just minimal fluid around the gallbladder
attributed to her congestive heart failure.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for evaluation of
double valve surgery with additional studies to be done
including the completion of her echocardiogram which was done
on [**2150-12-8**].  Please refer to the above results.  The
elevated AST and ALT were again noted the following morning
to be elevated as well as INR of 1.4.  Hepatology
consultation was called to evaluate the patient.  It was
recommended that the patient have some Vitamin K
subcutaneously and repeat liver function tests and INR check
in the morning.  Carotid ultrasound was also ordered.  The
patient remained on the medical service and was seen by the
hepatology fellow.  Please refer to the official consultation
note dated [**2150-12-6**], which was completed preoperatively.
Additional studies were recommended by hepatology service.
Preoperatively on [**2150-12-6**], the patient had an episode of
left sided chest pain and was given intravenous Morphine and
a bolus of normal saline.  This was then stopped after the
patient complained of worsening dyspnea.  The patient was
evaluated again.  INR the next day rose to 2.2.  The patient
was appropriate at that time with no asterixis and continued
to be followed on the medical service in preparation for her
surgery.  The patient was also seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**] of
the heart failure service and cardiology for the patient's
worsening congestive heart failure.  The patient was loaded
with Digoxin per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**].  Swan-Ganz catheter was placed
and the patient was then intubated on [**2150-12-7**], by
anesthesia given her aortic stenosis and increasing
respiratory distress with respiratory rate over 30 and an
unobtainable peripheral oxygen saturation. At the time, her
potassium was 5.8.  The patient was intubated successfully
and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit from [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Six.
