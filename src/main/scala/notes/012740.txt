  RADIOLOGY
=============
CT CHEST ([**2170-10-24**])

IMPRESSION:
1. Right upper lobe and lingular subsegmental filling defects
compatible with acute pulmonary emboli.
Discussed with ED and medicine team house-staff at 4:25 pm
[**2170-10-24**].
2. Pleural calcified plaques compatible with prior asbestos
exposure. While mild reticular and ground glass opacities at
bilateral posterior lung bases most likely represent dependent
atelectasis, it can also be seen in early asbestosis. In case of
clinical concern for asbestosis, an HRCT with prone imaging can
be obtained on a non-emergent basis as an outpatient following
treatment for the acute PE.
3. Borderline mediastinal lymphadenopathy of uncertain clinical
Significance.
4. Splenomegaly.
5. Questionable hypodense lesion in the inferior aspect of the
right lobe of the liver is incompletely characterized. An
ultrasound can be obtained for further evaluation if clinically
warranted.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo male with a recent right TKA who
presents with worsening dyspnea for the past week and found to
have bradycardia and PE.

# Dyspnea/Pulmonary embolus: 2 predisposing factors for PE
(factor V leiden and post-op). Patient with small bilat
subsegmental PEs on CTA of the chest despite being therapeutic
on coumadin, although it is not clear that this was not present
prior to anticoagulation.  He had no evidence of LE DVT.  He was
short of breath but without O2 requirement.  Despite the PE he
was supratherapeutic on admission with INR of 3.3.  Change in
INR goal or IVC filter placement was thought not to be necessary
given h/o intermittent discontinuation of anticoagulation for
various procedures.  This was discussed with his outpt
hematologist who will continue to follow.

# BRADYCARDIA: Patient was previously in junctional escape
rhythm and converted to sinus bradycardia.  Patient's
lightheadedness was most likely a consequence of bradycardia
made worse with atenolol.  He did not present in renal failure.
Atenolol was started peri-op and likely at too high of a dose.
It was discontinued. Pt continued to be bradycardic, dropping to
high 30s while sleeping but he was not symptomatic.

# Hypotension:  Patient reports low blood pressures at baseline
SBPs in 90s.  If atenolol was cause of bradycardia is is also
likely the cause of his hypotension to the SBP of 80s.  He was
given a bolus of IVF.  Atenolol was discontinued.  Terazosin was
changed to flomax due to orthostatic symptoms.

# Hypothyroidism: Pt was noted to have TSH mildly elevated at
4.4.  In setting of post-op recovery no change was made to
synthroid dose.  TSH should be followed as outpt.

# TKR repair/pain: Pain was controlled with tylenol and
tramadol.  He was discharged to rehab for continued physical
therapy.
