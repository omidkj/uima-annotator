History of Present Illness:
60yoM with h/o HepC cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and
type II diabetes, with recurrent ascites admitted for TIPS
evaluation. The patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital 794**]
Hospital in RI [**2178-4-28**] with complaint of one month worsening LE
edema, weakness, increasing abdominal girth, and difficulty
walking. At that time he was found to have a [Na+] 117. There he
underwent 6L paracentesis with albumin replacement.
Echocardiogram was performed showing EF 60%, no valvular
disease. Prior to transfer [Na+] 122, HgB 8 but no transfusion
given.

On the floor, he reports feeling fine, but still very weak. He
is a poor historian and unable to characterize symptoms. He
denies chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, nausea,
vomiting, confusion, changes in abd girth, LE swelling.

Pertinent Results:
Liver U/S: IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis without evidence of focal lesion.
2. Ascites.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. The hepatic vessels are patent with normal waveforms.

Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
[Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Cirrhosis: Patient was transferred from OSH for TIPS
evaluation for recurrent ascites.  TIPS was performed, although
complicated by intraperitoneal bleeding.  This was treated
supportively with octreotide, FFP, and platelets, and
subsequently his hematocrit stabilized.  Patient continues to
have recurrent ascites, although less severe.  Required
multiples paracenteses during admission, some of which were
grossly bloody, after the TIPS.  Due to falling hematocrit,
there was initially concern for variceal bleed, and he was
transferred to MICU for closer monitoring.  However, he remained
hemodynamically stable and the bleeding was attributed to slow
intra-adbominal bleed due to possible capsular injury from TIPS.
 Prior to discharge, peritoneal fluid cleared.  There was never
evidence of infection, and patient is on Ciprfloxacin for SBP
prophylaxis given history of varices and low total protein in
ascitic fluid.  Prior to discharge, patient had a 2.5 liter
paracentesis.  Patient's propranolol was discontinued after
TIPS.  He was continued on lactulose 30mL [**Hospital1 **].  Diuretics were
restarted, Furosemide 40mg and Spironolactone 200mg daily prior
to discharge.  These had been held initially due to
hyponatremia, which did not recur.

Routine transplant laboratory tests were sent including
Hepatitis panel, tumor markers, viral serologies. RUQ U/S was
done. Echo was done to evaluate RV function and noted TR and
underestimate of RV systolic function. Patient then underwent
right heart cath which revealed mild pulmonary hypertension.  He
will continue to follow with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] in the transplant
clinic for further consideration of transplant.

# Wound care: High risk for developing cellulitis, given
substantial lower extremity edema and diabetes mellitus.  He
needs daily clean dressing changes with bacitracin ointment to
prevent this from worsening.  Alsot, patient should schedule
appointment with his podiatrist within 1-2 weeks of being
discharged.  Patient has bilateral stasis changes and weeping
skin in both lower-extremities.  He was not frankly cellulitic,
given absence of warmth on skin exam, no fevers, white count, or
evidence of any positive blood cultures.  However, his
ciprofloxacin dose for SBP, was doubled prophylactically to
500mg for 1 week course, as this will cover most likely
organisms.  He needs to finish 7 days of 500mg qdaily, and then
resume 250mg daily afterwards for SBP prophylaxis.

# Diabetes mellitus - Patient was on oral rosiglitazone prior to
discharge.  Due to difficult glycemic control, he was
transitioned to insulin.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted.  Final regimen
was insulin 70/30 30 units twice a day.  Patient's primary care
physician was notified and will further adjust his regimen on
follow-up appointment.  Patient will have VNA at [**Hospital3 **]
facility to help with this.

# Renal Failure: Patient had Creatinine elevation  to 1.7 and
felt to be elevated due to diuretic use and blood loss.
Subsequently normalized, with discharge creatinine 1.1.

# Pancytopenia: Likely due to splenic sequestration from portal
hypertension.  Patient received several peri-procedural platelet
transfusions and blood transfusions as needed for blood loss.
Otherwise, this was stable.  Will need to be followed as
outpatient.

# Bipolar disorder: Continued lexapro and risperidone per outpt
regimen, and discharged with refills based on this regimen.

# Hypertension - patient was normotensive during this admission.
 He was on propranolol for portal hypertension, which was
discontinued after TIPS.  Can be restarted if patient develops
hypertension as outpatient.

# Nutrition: Patient will need to observe low-sodium fluid
restricted diet as outpatient.

# Hyponatremia: Secondary to diuretics, resolved.  Diuretics
restarted an patient tolerating.

# Prophylaxis: Patient was on pantoprazole and was very
ambulatory, therefore DVT prophylaxis was witheld.  He was
continued on lactulose for preventing encephalopathy after TIPS.
