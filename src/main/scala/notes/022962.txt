Admission Date: [**2185-11-8**]        Discharge Date: [**2185-11-14**]

Service:  CSU


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51-year-old
woman, status post aortic valve replacement with a number 21
St. Jude valve on [**11-6**].  She was discharged home on
[**11-3**].  She reports increasing dyspnea over the weekend.
Shortness of breath continued and then the patient also
complained of diaphoresis with a small amount of sternal
drainage over the 2 days prior to admission.  She was seen in
the emergency room on the day of admission.  A transthoracic
echo done at that time showed a circumferential pericardial
effusion with right diastolic collapse, consistent with
tamponade.  Ejection fraction of 55 percent and a well seated
aortic valve.  The patient then was brought to the cardiac
catheterization lab for drainage of the pericardial
perfusion.  Please see the cath lab report for full details.
By report, approximately 300-350 cc of bloody fluid was
removed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for aortic valve
replacement on [**2185-10-28**].  Hypertension, depression,
obesity, cholelithiasis and non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus.  The patient states no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
2. Sertraline 100 mg every day.
3. Aspirin 81 mg every day.
4. Warfarin 2.5 mg every day.
5. Metformin 500 mg b.i.d.
6. Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d.
7. Ferrous sulfate 325 every day.
8. Fluticasone 2 puffs b.i.d. p.r.n.
9. Vitamin C 500 mg b.i.d.
10.      Glucotrol XL 5 mg every day.


LABORATORY DATA:  On day of admission, white count 16.4
hematocrit 27.1, platelets 813, PT 22.5, INR 3.2.  Sodium
135, potassium 4.3, chloride 97, CO2 22, BUN 15, creatinine
0.8, glucose 156.  Pericardial fluid showed white cells of
14,300, hematocrit of 25.5, total protein 6.9, glucose 88.
LDH 815, amylase 20 and albumin 3.7.

Chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly, resolution of small
pericardial effusion and persistent atelectasis of the left
lung.

Repeat echo done after cardiac catheterization laboratory
drainage of the pericardial effusion showed symmetric LVH
with an ejection fraction of 55 percent.  Small
circumferential effusion without evidence of hemodynamic
compromise and largely resolved effusion with no tamponade.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97, heart rate 81 sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 142/63, respiratory rate 26, O2
saturation 94 percent on 2 liters.  Neurologically alert and
oriented times three, follows commands.  Moves all
extremities.  Nonfocal exam.  Respiratory clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.
S1-S2 with a sharp click.  Sternum is stable.  Incision with
small amount of murky drainage from the superior pole of the
incision.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Warm and well
perfused without edema.  Two plus dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for further observation
following pericardial drainage.  On hospital day two, the
patient remained hemodynamically stable.  She had a repeat
echocardiogram which showed continued resolution of the
pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade, following
which she was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit to 524 for continuing post drain care and
observation.  On hospital day number three, the patient
remained hemodynamically stable. The small amount of drainage
from her chest wound had completely resolved by this point.
The pericardial drain was removed and an echocardiogram done
on hospital day three also showed good cardiac function with
no reaccumulation of the pericardial effusion.

On hospital day four, it was noted that the patient's INR had
drifted down to 1.3.  She was, therefore, started on heparin
and her Coumadin was resumed.  Additional echocardiogram
showed that there was no reaccumulation of her pericardial
effusion.  Over the next several days, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  Her heparin doses were adjusted as
were her Coumadin doses and the patient remained in the
hospital awaiting her INR to reach therapeutic range once
again.  Ultimately on hospital day seven, the patient was
discharged home.  At the time of this dictation, the
patient's physical exam is as follows.  Temperature 97.6,
heart rate 73 sinus rhythm, blood pressure 110/60,
respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 96 percent on room air.
Weight on day of discharge 93.5.  On day of admission 94.3.

LABORATORY DATA:  PT 16.7, PTT 61.2, INR 1.8, sodium 138,
potassium 4.5, chloride 100, CO2 26, BUN 15, creatinine 0.7,
glucose 104.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times three.
Moves all extremities.  Follows commands.  Nonfocal exam.
Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm.  S1-S2 with sharp click.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Warm with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Sternal incision is healing well.  There is no drainage or
erythema.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 33066**] condition, at the time of discharge, is stable.
She is to be discharged home with visiting nurses.  She is to
follow-up with [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2462**], M.D. in [**3-1**] weeks.  Follow-
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55573**]  on the [**11-16**] for INR check.

2. Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
