Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, positive blood cultures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement
Dialysis catheter removal and replacement


History of Present Illness:
49 yo female, h/o recent admission for complicated enterococcus
endocarditis (initially with vegetation on aortic valve with
possible migration to mitral valve), bilateral knee
replacements, IV cocaine abuse, presenting now with blood
cultures positive for enterococcus from 1 week ago and
right-sided pleuritic chest pain.  Upon discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2162-12-7**], she went to [**Hospital3 672**] Rehab where she stayed
until [**12-28**] before returning home.  She was receiving dialysis
at that time (gentamicin initiated last admission for
endocarditis caused acute renal failure) and was having
surveillance blood cultures drawn weekly at HD.  Cultures from
[**1-11**] grew enterococcus, (sensitive to amp, vanco, cipro).  For
this, she was started on Vancomycin, Ceftaz, and Ampicillin.

Additionally, she developed acute, pleuritic chest pain on the
night prior to admission. She described it as occurring with
deep breaths, radiating to the back, [**8-8**], relieved by sitting
forward, without radiation to arm/jaw, no n/v/diaphoresis. She
states she does not usually get chest pain/angina and has not
experienced pain like this in the past.  The pain has been
getting worse and now is constant (still worse with deep
breathing).  She states she has been having 'chills,' but denies
subjective fevers, night sweats.  She has a stable [**6-4**] pillow
orthopnea and has PND (not increased or worse recently).  She
states that since she was started on hemodialysis, she has had
LE swelling, sometimes asymmetric (usually L>R).

On presentation to the ED, she was uncomfortable, afebrile with
stable vitals, saturating adequately on RA (but placed on NC
O2).  Vanco level was checked, Cr was 2.5 (baseline wnl, s/p
gent was up to 6, 3.1 on discharge last admission), blood
cultures were sent, and 1 set of CE's were sent (Troponin T
0.03; was 0.05 on last discharge).  Chest X-ray showed some
upper zone redistribution, and LENI's/TTE were ordered.  She was
admitted to medicine for further workup of this chest pain and
positive blood cultures.

Past Medical History:
1.  Endocarditis recently, initial vegetation on Aortic Valve,
with migration to Mitral Valve; treated with amp/gent.  Most
recent TTE on [**12-6**] showed 4+ AR with small veg on AV, 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 114**]e-sized vegetation on MV, EF=55%
2.  Gentamicin-induced renal failure last admission. On
hemodialysis.
3.  Osteoarthritis R hip ?????? scheduled of THR in [**6-/2161**], but
missed appointment, now with no plans to pursue surgery.
4.  s/p L knee replacement ?????? [**2157**], complicated by septic knee,
hardware removed and then replaced 1 year later.
5.  s/p R knee replacement ?????? [**2157**]
6.  Asthma ?????? diagnosed years ago, no hospitalizations, no
intubations, no attacks in 1 year
7.  Bipolar disorder ?????? scheduled to begin valproic acid therapy
soon
8.  Anxiety disorder ?????? treated with klonopin
9.  IV cocaine abuse ?????? last use was months ago by her report


Social History:

home. She lives with her husband and daughter (age 19) in

Radiology
[**2162-1-18**] LENI's: IMPRESSION: Limited study. No evidence of DVT.

[**2162-1-18**]- Lung scan-) Central deposition of radiotracer with
heterogeneous ventilation to the upper lobes. 2) Patient refused
perfusion images, therefore, this is anincomplete
ventilation/perfusion study.

[**2162-1-18**] CXR: Again demonstrated is a right IJ double- lumen
catheter, unchanged in position. There is stable LV enlargement.
There is upper zone redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature
with a small left- sided pleural and questionable right-sided
pleural effusion consistent with mild left heart failure. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There is no
pneumothorax.

[**2162-1-18**] EKG: NSR 91, left axis deviation, with t-wave
inversions in III, AVF, V1-V5; unchanged from EKG from [**2161-12-5**]

[**2162-1-18**]- TTE-Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall  motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There are
at least 2 small, fibrotic masses on the aortic valve, which may
represent healed or active vegetations. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. Two mitral regurgitation jets are seen,
one of which probably represents a small hole in the anterior
leaflet.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2161-12-6**], the aortic mass is evolving and the mitral mass is
gone.

[**2162-1-26**] Left upper extremity U/S-IMPRESSION: No DVT on this
somewhat limited study.

[**2162-1-26**]- CT abd/pelvis with contrast-IMPRESSION:
1) New pericardial effusion, otherwise unremarkable CT of the
chest. No identifiable source of infection within the abdomen or
pelvis.
2) Soft-tissue fullness within the pancreatic head, worrisome
for pancreatic neoplasm. An MRI of the pancreas is advised.

[**2162-1-28**] Echo-Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right
ventricular systolic function is normal with borderline
preserved right
ventricular systolic function. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.  There are echo dense masses associated with
the aortic valve which likely  represent vegetations. Severe
(4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen
(not fully assessed). There is a pericardial effusion that is
small to moderate anteriorly and large inferolaterally (upto
2.7-3.0 cm wide). There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Compared to the prior study of [**2162-1-21**], the
pericardial effusion is now
larger.

[**2162-2-2**]- AP CXR-A single AP supine image. Comparison study dated
[**2162-2-1**]. A new endotracheal tube is noted, its tip at
the level of the thoracic inlet. The right IJ Swan catheter tip
remains well positioned in
