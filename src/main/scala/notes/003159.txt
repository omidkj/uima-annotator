Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo Russian speaking F with CAD, AFib on coumadin, DM,
HTN, CHF, CRI (Baseline Cr=1.4), anemia (baseline hct ~30), who
presents from [**Hospital 100**] rehab with episodes of blood in her stool.

.
#  GI bleed: The pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. On admission the
patient had a negative NG lavage in setting of INR of 7.9.  Tthe
etiology was felt to be a LGIB in the setting of a
supratherapeutic INR.  The DDX included diverticulosis, AVM,
malignancy, hemorrhoids. On admission the pt received 15 mg of
Vit K. She was given 2 units of FFP in addition to those given
in the ED for a total of 4 Units and transfused 2 units of
PRBC's. Initially she received q 6 hour hct checks and an IV PPI
[**Hospital1 **]. Her [**Hospital1 **] and Coumdain were held. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the pt's hct
stabilized. GI was consulted but did not want to do any
intervention because they believed bleed was caused by
supratherapeutic INR. The pt was transfered to the floor as she
was hemodynamically stable, her hct is stable, and her INR
dropped from 7.9 on admit to 0.9. While on the floor the pt
initially reported feeling weak, but on the day of discharge
reported feeling well after 2 days of po.
.
#  Coagulopathy.  The pt presented with an INR of 7.9. The pt
had been off coumadin x5 days, but had been supratherapeutic and
difficult to control on past admission.  She had no new
medications. Her coagulopathy was likely related to malnutrition
and poor control on coumadin. She was given FFP and Vitamin K as
above. Her coumadin was held. Her INR returned as above to 0.9.
Per ortho, she was placed on lovenox 30 mg qd X 4 weeks for
better-controlled anti-coagulation.
.
# CV:
h/o CAD: The pt was placed on a BB and ACE-I, once her preussure
could tolerate them. She wa splaced back on her home statin and
[**Hospital Unit Name **], once her hct was stable.
pump: Pt has a known CHF (EF 30-35%). An ACE-I was added for
afterload reduction. rhythm: h/o PAFIB. The remained in sinus
with well controlled HR. She wa splaced on  anti-coag as above.

.
#  Recent Hip Fracture s/p reduction and fixation: The patient
was kept non wt bearing throughout her admission with PT
follow-up. She was placed on standing tylenol with prn oxycodone
for pain control. Eventually she was weaned off the tylenol with
the prns adequately controlling her pain. Ortho recommended
lovenox out-pt as above.
.
# HTN. Her BP remained well-currently during admission. She was
continued on her out-pt lopressor 25 mg po bid. Her out-pt
amlodipine was d/c'd and lisinopril was added given her known
poor pump fxn and DM.

# DM. Not treated at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. Her Blood sugars remained
well controlled on this admission without treatment.
.
#  FEN.  The pt was initially made NPO. On discharge she was
tolerating a regular heart healthy/DM diet.
.
#  PPX.  anti-coag discussed above, PPI [**Hospital1 **] (switched to po once
on the floor), bowel regimen
.
#  Code:  DNR/DNI as per NH records
