HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old male with
multiple medical problems including cocaine abuse, dilated
cardiomyopathy, biventricular heart failure with an ejection
fraction of approximately 20%, severe mitral regurgitation,
substance abuse, etcetera, who was initially admitted to the
C-MED Service on [**2101-8-24**], with increased dyspnea,
acute renal failure, and mild transaminitis.  The patient
initially attempted diuresis for congestive heart failure
without improvement.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.,
digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d., Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On hospital day two was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit secondary to acute mental status changes
for PEG placement for improved hemodynamic monitoring.
Psychiatric and Renal Services were consulted.  In the
Coronary Care Unit PEG placement was unsuccessful, but the
patient was gently rehydrated with improved urine output,
decreased creatinine, improved blood pressure.  Urinalysis,
microscopic examination, by renal team revealed muddy brown
cast consistent with acute tubular necrosis.  Renal toxic
medications (ACE inhibitor) were initially started gently
once the patient became euvolemic with normalized renal
function.  At the request of the Psychiatric Service, a
delirium workup was completed.  The patient was without
evidence of obvious etiology other than uremia.  Symptoms
improved markedly with hydration.  The patient did not have
any evidence of heroine withdrawal.

The patient was transferred back to the C-MED Service for
continued medical management and discharge.
