Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Witnessed seizure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 58-year-old right-handed woman with
metastatic breast cancer to the brain and ribs currently on
HK1-272 04-266 trial, now with chief complaint of witnessed,
grand mal seizure. She initially presented to [**Hospital3 3765**]
earlier today after generalized seizure witnessed by her
husband. [**Name (NI) **] is a very poor historian, but reports going to
her usual, psychotherapy appointment this a.m., in her usual
state of health. Afterwards, she walked out of the hospital with
her husband and then her story becomes a bit unclear. By report,
her husband witnessed a seizure lasting 2-3 minutes, involving
her arms and legs. She was observed to be snoring loudly after
seizure.  Patient reports waking up in the ambulance on her way
to [**Hospital **] Hosp. At [**Hospital1 **], patient given fosphenytoin with
subsequent allergic reaction halfway through infusion with
pruritis, urticaria, erythema to abdomen. Infusion stopped and
she was treated with Benadryl 50 mg x 1, prednisone 40 mg x 1,
ativan 1 mg. Labs at [**Hospital1 **] with WBC 5.8, Hct 33.6 (MCV 83.6),
Plts 278, and CK 215. In our emergency room, her vital signs
were stable. She did not have further seizure activity, and she
was given 1,000 mg [**Hospital1 13401**] x 1 and admitted to OMED service. Head
CT was negative for acute process.

Past Medical History:
Oncology History: Somewhat unclear as patient longtime patient
of [**Hospital1 18**] and no recent synopsis of treatments:
-patient with breast cancer with stable mets to brain, ribs
-initially diagnosed with right breast cancer in [**2162**]. Biopsy at
that time revealed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma and the
patient underwent a mastectomy (tumor size was 4.5 cm, ER
positive, and Her2neu positive).
-approximately 14 months after mastectomy, underwent six cycles
of CMF therapy.
-[**2174**]: left hip met
-initiated care w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2175**]; XRT and herceptin
-Navelbine and Herceptin
-Herceptin and carboplatin [**1-27**]
-now with brain and rib mets
-has been on multiple protocols
-currently on HK1-272 04-266 trial with several recent dose
reductions, Zometa last received on [**2182-4-16**]
-seen in ED on [**2182-3-21**] with rib pain, ruled out for PE, thought
to be due to known metastases.

OTHER PMH:
Asthma and elevated cholesterol.

Social History:
She lives w/ her husband, and she has 4 grown children.  She is
a lifetime non- smoker and rare alcohol use.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
Vital Signs:  Temperature 98.1 F, Blood Pressure 128/80, Pulse
117, Respiration 20, Oxygen Saturation 97% in Room Air.
General: Restless, moving all extremities all about,
alert/oriented, scattered; She is inattentive, and keep needing
to re-focus her for history
HEENT: MM dry, OP clear but dry; EOMI
NECK: supple, no lymphadenopathy, no rigidity
BREAST: mastectomy on right; port a cath c/d/i
CHEST: CTA; pruritic-uriticarial rash on anterior chest; patient
scratching actively
CV: RRR, no m/r/g; patient kept talking through exam even when I
asked her to be quiet for auscultation
ABD: soft non tender,nabs, no masses
EXTRM: swaying them around, decreased tone but normal strength
NEURO: alert and oriented x 3 but a few seconds later she said "
i am going to be transferred to [**Hospital3 **]." Appropriate but
needs constant re-focusing for questions. Scattered. Normal
speech. Moving all extremities about with ease.  Spelled WORLD
foreward but not backward. Serial sevens with ease. Cerebellar
examination intact. did not ambulate patient.

MRI Head [**2182-4-24**]:
FINDINGS: All of the sequences with the exception of the axial
FLAIR sequence are so severely limited by patient motion as to
be practically diagnostically useless. On the FLAIR sequence,
the extensive white matter edema in the periventricular regions
and the left temporal lobe are identified and are similar to the
previous examination. On the postcontrast sequence in today's
examination, the previously noted temporal lobe enhancing
lesions can be discerned. It cannot be compared adequately.

IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study due to patient motion.
Persistent white matter abnormal signal and enhancing focus in
the left temporal lobe.

MRI Head [**2182-4-26**]:
FINDINGS: Again, two small enhancing lesions are seen in the
left frontal cortical and subcortical region with mild
surrounding edema. Additionally, there is an approximately 15 mm
enhancing lesion seen in the left temporal lobe with a small
adjacent enhancing nodule. This lesion on axial images appears
slightly larger compared to the prior study. However, compared
on the sagittal and coronal images it remains unchanged.
Therefore, the differences on the axial images could be due to
slice selection. An additional small focus of enhancement is
seen adjacent to the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle. Diffuse periventricular and subcortical
hyperintensities are seen on the FLAIR and T2-weighted images
which could be related to small vessel disease and/or radiation
therapy. There is no mass effect or midline shift seen. There is
moderate ventriculomegaly which could be related to atrophy.
There are no other definite areas of abnormal parenchymal or
meningeal enhancement seen.

IMPRESSION: Overall, no significant interval change compared to
the previous MRI of [**2182-3-27**]. The left frontal and temporal
enhancing lesions are again seen with surrounding edema. A small
focus of enhancement is again seen adjacent to the occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle. Diffuse hyperintensities in
the white matter are again noted which could be related to small
vessel disease or radiation therapy.

EEG [**2182-4-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal portable EEG. There were no areas of
persistant focal slowing, no epileptiform feature. Tachycardia
was noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58-year-old right-handed woman with metastatic breast
cancer to [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], here with new seizures, presumably from
disease progression. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care given that her oncology care is here. She was intially
confused on [**2182-4-23**] overnight and was less so during [**2182-4-24**].
She continued to recieve Benadryl prn and in addition received
ranitidine, Zyrtec, and Ativan. On the evening of [**2182-4-24**], she
became increasingly confused and agitated requiring restraints
and a sitter and she was then no longer able to be managed on
the floor. She denied dysuria, cough, subj fever, pain. She was
noted to have some phlebitis on her left arm at the site of a
prior IV and her husband noted an increase in her urinary
urgency. She had no chest pain, shortness of breath, N/V/D. Her
agitation was possibly due to Benadryl given that she had a
similar reaction in the past to phenobarbitol. Most likely
etiology was polypharmacy - she has had steroids, multiple
anticholinergics (Benadryl, ranitidine, Zyrtec), and Ativan.
Also on ddx was non-convulsive status, infection (? UTI, ?
cellulitis at old IV site), primary effect of metastases.  Her
Zyrtec and Benadryl were discontinued.  She was monitored in the
ICU over the next 48 hrs and was transferred back to the floor
after her mental status had drastically improved with the d/c of
anticholinergics.

(1) Seizure/Mental Status Changes: Her grand mal seizure was
intially felt to be most likely from progression of disease.
She had an allergic reaction to fosphenytoin at t
