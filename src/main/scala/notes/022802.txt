Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea and confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yoF w/ a h/o dementia, s/p head trauma and
SDH/SAH (in [**2184**]), is a long term nursing home and presents from
the [**Hospital3 **] with dyspnea and confusion.
.
At the [**Hospital3 **] labs and a u/a, urine cx were obtained and
the patient was started on levaquin 500mg IV x 1.  She was noted
to have a HR of 112, RR of 26, RA O2 sat of 74% and 91% on 2L
NC.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: P 126  BP 160/palp  R 42 O2 sat 99%.
During her ER stay she rec'd cipro for a +u/a, duonebs and
aspirin.  Her RR improved to 30, her HR improved to 84, T was
98.8 and O2 sat was 100% on 3L NC.  The ER discussed with the
cardiology fellow on call the slightly elevated troponin and
given her age and h/o SAH / SDH she was thought not to be a
candidate for anticoagulation but to use aspirin only.  The
patient has been DNR/DNI for at least 5 years, when in the ER
her daughter had reversed her code status and per the ER staff
her daughter was very clear about the reversal.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yoF long term nursing home pt with dementia
who presents from the [**Hospital3 2558**] with dyspnea and confusion.
.
# Tachypnea: The patient was initially tachypneic to the mid 40s
in the ED. Upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was breathing more
comfortably at a rate of 30.  Initially noted to have wheezes on
exam and be tachycardic. CXR was unremarkable, and no acute
cardiopulmonary process was noted. CTA chest w/o PE or other
reason for respiratory distress however she has slight bibasilar
opacities. Given that she is dehydrated it is possible her
respiratory distress is related to pneumonia and obstructive
airway disease.   She has an unknown smoking history and her
daughter was [**Name2 (NI) 16535**] for collateral information. ABG was
unremarkable. Given she had wheezes, she was given atrovent nebs
q6h, albuterol nebs q6h. As patient with possible infiltrates on
CTA, low grade temp at [**Hospital3 **], respiratory distress and
leukocytosis, she will be treated for nosocomial pneumonia with
cefepime for 8 days.  A sputum sample was not able to be
obtained for sputum culture.  Final read on CXR and chest CTA
pending on discharge.
.
# Confusion: This altered mental status was most likely
secondary to respiratory distress and UTI.  UA in the nursing
home was reportedly positive. Upon arrival to [**Last Name (LF) 153**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
daughter, patient's mental status returned to baseline. Patient
will be treated with cefepime for 8 days for possible pulmonary
infections, and UTI. CT head was negative for any intracranial
pathology. Urine culture was pending on discharge.
.
# UTI: Patient had a positive u/a at the [**Hospital3 **] and was
started on levaquin. Per report she has cultures pending there.
Given that patient has a history of proteus resistant to cipro
(in [**2190**]), quinolone was changed to cefepime (for PNA as above).
She will be discharged with 8 day course of cefepime.
.
# Leukocytosis: Likely related to urinary tract infection and
possible pulmonary infections. It resolved on HD1. Blood culture
and urine cultures were pending on discharge.
.
# Elevated troponin: In the setting of sinus tach w/ PACs,
hypertension, tachypnea so likely related to demand, especially
since MB not elevated but small NSTEMI is also a possibility.
At this point she is symptom free. Troponin trended down from
0.22 to 0.21. EKG was unchanged from her prior studies. Given
her h/o SAH and SDH, age, as well as likely demand,
anticoagulation was held off.  Patient should discuss the pros
and cons of starting aspirin therapy with her primary care
doctor.
.
# Elevated BUN, dehydration: Patient was given 1L normal saline
after coming to ICU, and her BUN and creatinine trended down.
.
# FEN: Patient was seen by speech and swallow, who didn't note
aspirations but couldn't rule out micro-aspiration unless a
video swallowing study is done. As patient has been tolerating
POs at the nursing home, a video swallowing study is deferred.
.
# Prophylaxis: Patient was on subutaneous heparin tid for DVT
prophylaxis.
.
# Code:  Full (discussed with daughter). Patient was DNR/NRI,
but daughter reversed the order in the [**Name (NI) **]. We confirmed with
daughter on the status.
.
# Communication: Patient's daughter: [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 46**] in
[**Location (un) 686**], phone # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38634**].  [**Doctor First Name 38635**] daughter is
[**Name (NI) **] 1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 38636**].  We attempted to contact daughter and
granddaughter prior to discharge however couldn't reach either
of them.
