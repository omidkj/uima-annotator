Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
from [**Hospital1 **] with acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Swan-ganz catheter placement
intubation


History of Present Illness:
admitted [**Date range (1) 23271**] for ARF (2.3), supratherapeutic INR (3.2)
after mechanical fall with R orbital fracture.  Noted to have
a.fib with RVR but rate controlled with b-blocker.  Cardiology
felt cardioversion not indicated.  Baseline BP's noted to be
80-110 in legs and undetectable in arms.
ACE-I and lasix held.  Cr improved with gentle diuresis and d/c
to rehab.
*
At rehab he was re-initiated on his lasix for increasing lower
extremity edema and increasing evidence of CHF.  The lasix was
titrated to a dose of 80mg PO BID with good urine outpt but
progressively increasing creatinine from 2.0 to 4.0.
*
Also, he had mutliple episodes of a.fib with RVR requiring large
doses of lopressor.  On [**2-6**] he was noted to be more lethargic
and have gross hematuria.  His coumadin was held for INR 6.1 and
bladder irragation initiated.  On [**2-7**] ABG 7.21/53/71 (2L NC)
and started on BiPAP.  Subseqent ABG 7.23/54/79 (3L NC) but not
in significant respiratory distress at time of d/c per rehab
notes and remained at 2-3L NC throughout rehab course.
*
In ED was given 1 unit FFP for INR 4.9 and initial CXR with
right sided consolidation.  Subsequently, he was noted to have
mild resp distress and decrease in SBP to 80's which transiently
responded to dopamine gtt.  However, he developed a.fib c RVR at
rate of 150s and dopamine weaned off after 1L NS bolus.
However, resp distress continued with CXR showing CHF and
intubated.  His SBP's dropped again to 80's.  Fem line placed
and started on levophed.  He was given decadron, vancomycin,
levofloxacin.

Social History:
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives alone in an apartment in
[**Location (un) **], but is close with his sister, who helps him out
often. States he does his own shopping and cooking. Gets around

occasional drinks. Priorly a machinest but now on disability.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 M c h/o CHF, a.fib on coumadin, renal transplant on
immunosuppresive meds with ARF, hypercarbic respiratory failure,
coagulopathy, and hypotension.

The etiology of his respiratory failure was not clear but pt was
kept on ventilator to help compensate for metabolic aciodosis.
In addition, he had lung collapse on CXR that suggestive of
mucus plugging. He was bronched with good results.  However his
resp status continued to decline as his urine output decrease
and he developed more pulm edema.  He was noted to have R lung
collapse again and repeat bronchoscopy did not show mucus
plugging.  The likely etiology of his hypotension was felt to be
cardiogenic.  Echocardiogram showd he had dilated RV but
relatively preserved LV suggesting that he needed pre-load to
maintain cardiac output.  Trials of diuresis and IV hydration
were not successful in optimizing his BP, urine outpt, and pulm
edema.  Ultimately, he had PA catheter placed that showed CI of
2.91 by Fick but PCWP 30 and PA 90/45.  At this point he was
felt to have biventricular failure and unlikely to be weaned off
vent as well as require inotropes/pressors to optimize
hemodynamics.  He had progressive uremia requiring hemodialysis
however family opted to not intiatiate renal replacement
therapy.  Given his deteriorating condition and poor prognosis,
the family made the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] on [**2136-2-11**].  He was put on morphine
gtt and passed on AM [**2136-2-12**].
