Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital for cardiac
catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization: Thromectomy/Thrombolysis/[**Hospital3 **] to SVG OM1
with poor result, PTCA and [**Hospital3 **] to PDA with good result.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81811**] is a 68M with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, and hyperlipidemia
who presented to an OSH with chest pain, admitted for one night
at OSH, and set to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
OSH course: He presented to the OSH ED with acute onset of SSCP
while raking leaves at home. Vitals were T 97.7 HR 62 RR 18 BP
107/65, 95%on RA on presentation. He had been having stable
exertional angina, seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40149**], and had nuclear stress
testing which showed mild inferior wall ischemia with mild
reduction in the LV systolic function with an EF of 45%. He was
scheduled for an elective cath on [**2157-1-10**] until his symptoms
developed. He took one SL nitro at home without any effect. He
received morphine, Zofran, Ativan, and a GI cocktail in the ED
with resoluation of his chest pain. He was hemodynamically
stable overnight. No recurrence of his chest pain. His troponin
increased from 0.01 to 0.66, MB 7.8 from 1.7, CPKs all normal.
He was given nitro paste, IV heparin, and Plavix 300 mg PO.
.
In the cath lab, LMCA was normal, LAD TO mid, LCx TO mid, RCA
sequential 70%, mid 90% proximal PDA, SVG-RCA patent,
SVG-D1-OM1, D1 limp patent, OMI limb diffuse plaque with large
thrombus, and LIMA-LAD TO mid. Thrombectomy, thrombolysis, PTCA
and stent x 1 SVG OM1, PTCA PDA and stent. SVG OM1 result not
satisfying, will likely close off.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU after cath, he was having episodes of
hematemesis, throwing up about 200 mL of bright red blood with
SBPs to the 80s. He was given antiemetics and 2 units of PRBCs
were ordered. Integrillin was stopped. IVF and dopamine were
started.

Social History:
He lives with his wife, no children. Retired banker. Denies

Gen: WD/WN middle aged male in mild distress [**3-13**] to N/V.
HEENT: NC/AT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.
Evidence of dried blood in OP.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RR, normal S1, S2. No m/r/g. No thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. CTAB, no crackles,
wheezes or rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, NT/ND. No HSM or tenderness. Normoactive BS.
Ext: No c/c/e. Femoral venous sheath in place right groin, no
hematoma.


Pertinent Results:
Exercise Nuclear Stress performed on [**2156-12-16**] demonstrated:
Exercised 9 minutes and 9 seconds into Stage 4 of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
protocol stopping secondary to fatigue at 74% of his predicted
maximum heart rate. Negative for angina or diagnostic ischemic
ST-T wave changes. Nuclear testing revealed mild inferior wall
ischemia with mild reduction of left ventricular systolic
function with an EF of 45%. Compared to prior study in [**2154**], the
ischemia in the inferior wall appears more reversible.

LABORATORY DATA:
Outside hospital
BUN 19, Creat 1.1, K 4.7, WBC 5.2, hct 41.8 PLT 176 INR 1.2
.
CK 136 ---> 115 ---> 132
Troponin 0.01 ---> 0.66
CK-MB 1.7 ---> 7.8
.
CARDIAC ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the
mid- and distal septum, as well as mid-inferolateral and lateral
segments (multivessel CAD) . The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. No pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular
disease seen.

CATH [**12-18**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed 3 vessel disease of
the
native coronary arteries.  The LMCA had no angiographically
apparent
flow limiting disease.  The LAD had a total occlusion at the mid
segment.  The LCX had a total occlusion at the mid segment.  The
RCA had
sequential disease with 70% stenosis at the mid segment and 90%
stenosis
at the proximal r-PDA.
2. Selective venous graft angiography revealed widely patent
graft to
the distal RCA.  The second SVG graft which connected to the
first
diagonal with a jump to the first OM had a widely patent limb to
the
diagonal but the jump graft to the OM had diffuse plaquing with
a large
thrombus at the distal anastomosis.
3. Selective arterial conduit angiography revealed that the
LIMA-LAD had
a total occlusion at the mid segment of the LIMA. 4. Limited
resting
hemodynamics demonstrated diastolic dysfunction of the LV and RV
with
LVEDP of 15 mm Hg and a RVEDP 15 mm Hg.  The left sided filling
pressures were elevated with an elevated wedge pressure of 18 mm
Hg.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures 35/13 mm
Hg.
5. Stenting of PDA via SVG-RCA graft with a Taxus Atom 2.25x12mm
stent
6. Stenting of SVG-OM anastomosis lesion (second limb of a very
large
jump graft) with a MiniVision 2x15mm stent after administration
of IC
tpa and IC integrelin.
7. Post procedure hematemesis trated with EGD electrocautery.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Occlusion of arterial conduit.
4. Stenosis of saphenous vein graft.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o male with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who
presents as a transfer from an OSH with NSTEMI and taken
directly to the cardiac cath lab where 90%PDA and thrombus
occluding SVG-OM1 s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and thrombectomy/tPA/stenting of
SVG-OM1 c/b hypotension and upper GI Bleed.
.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE - Patient had evidence of NSTEMI at the
OSH. Cardiac cath revealed a fresh thrombus in his graft,
SVG-Diag that was unable to be opened despite balloon, wire, and
intracornary integrillin and tPA.  A stent was placed there and
in the PDA.  There was concern that the graft might be lost and
pt would have a peri-procedural MI.  This was not the case as
his CK peaked at 106 after Cath.
Upon arrival to the CCU after cath, he was having episodes of
hematemesis, throwing up about 200 mL of bright red blood with
SBPs to the 80s. He was given antiemetics and 2 units of PRBCs
were ordered. Integrillin was stopped. IVF and dopamine were
started.  GI was performed an upper endoscopy urgently and
cauterized a bleeding [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear.  Patient had no
further complications and was hemodynamically stable at
discharge.
- continue ASA and Plavix on discharge
- Continue Atenolol 50mg daily and Enalapril 5mg daily
.
# Pump:  Chronic systolic dysfunction, stable:  EF 45% with mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
hypokinesis of the mid- and distal septum, as well as
mid-inferolateral and lateral segments (consistent with
multivessel CAD). The remaining segments contract normally.
Patient remained euvolemic during his a
