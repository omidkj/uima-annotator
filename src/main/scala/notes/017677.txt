Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, arm pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-1-15**] - Catheter placement, coronary thrombectomy, coronary
artery infusion of eptifibatide, Intravascular ultrasound,
Coronary Angiography
[**2154-1-18**] Coronary catheterization with placement of 2 bare metal
stents to mid LAD.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 32 year-old with a PMH significant for HTN,
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who presents with a 3-day
history of chest and arm pain that developed with exertion with
some exertional dyspnea and fatigue.
.
The patient awoke Sunday ([**2154-1-13**]) feeling well and went to the
laundry mat walking 1-block with bags full of laundry and
developed some exertional dyspnea and left arm pain that
radiated in a pulsatile fashion to his fingers; without frank
chest pain, but with some diaphoresis. When he returned home,
his dyspnea improved with rest. However, his left arm pain
progressed to right arm pain even while resting. This pain
continued through Monday and early Tuesday morning he noted the
left arm pain was [**9-5**] in intensity and was sharp in character,
radiating to the left shoulder and back with some chest
discomfort that was constant. He presented to the BU Student
Health Center Tuesday PM and they gave him Aspirin 325 mg PO x 2
and called EMS. He was BIBA to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
management.
.
In the ED, initial VS 102 114/85 20 99% 2LNC. An EKG showed
sinus tachycardia @ 119, NA/NI, 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**]-elevations in lead
V2-6, 1-mm ST-elevations in leads aVL, I and inferior lead
reciprocal changes. He received Metoprolol 5 mg IV x 1, Heparin
bolus of 4000 units IV and Ativan 2 mg PO x 1. He was emergently
rushed to the cardiac cath [**Street Address(2) **] where the patient was noted to
have an abrupt cut-off at the mid-LAD with visible vessel
thrombus of the mid-LAD and distal reconstitution with
distal-LAD disease; underwent aspiration and ballooning of LAD
via RFA access (closed with angioseal). In the [**Street Address(2) **], he was given
Plavix 300 mg loading dose. Integrillin gtt was started and
heparin gtt was continued. In the cath [**Street Address(2) **] he was also
diaphoretic with a blood glucose of 390 mg/dL. He remained chest
pain free, but had on-going arm pain following the procedure.
.
On arrival in the CCU, the patient has some on-going left arm
pain while resting flat, but no chest pain, diaphoresis,
palpitations or nausea.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or pre-syncope.
.

venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. They deny bleeding at
the time of prior procedures or surgeries. Denies headaches or
vision changes. No cough or upper respiratory symptoms. Denies
dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations. No nausea or
vomiting, denies abdominal pain. No dysuria or hematuria. No

weakness, myalgias or neurologic complaints. No exertional
buttock or calf pain.

year-old - blood glucose runs in the 150-200 mg/dL range; takes
Lantus and Humalog)
2. Hypertension

Social History:
Patient lives at home with his wife, who is 9-weeks pregnant. He
denies any smoking history. He stopped drinking 8-years ago for
spiritual reasons. He is a BU graduate student who just moved
here from [**Location (un) 58091**], VA/DC for graduate school studying
practical theology. He notes significant stress related to
semester deadlines. He denies recreational substance use.


Family History:
Denies family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies,
or sudden cardiac death. Strong family history of diabetes,
hypertension and stroke.

[**2154-1-15**] CARDIAC CATH - French XBLAD3.5 guide provided good
support.  Crossed with Prowater very easily into the distal LAD.
 This did not restore flow in the apical LAD and visible
thrombus was seen to occlude
the vessel there.  Administered intracoronary Integrilin (180
mcg/kg x 2) and performed catheter based thrombectomy using the
Export catheter with significant clot removal/dissolution.
Administered intracoronary vasodilators. Perfomed intravascular
ultrasound using the Atlantis catheter and this revealed mild
diffuse atherosclerosis throughout the LAD and residual
subocclusive thrombus in the proximal LAD. A ChoICE PT XS [**Name (NI) **]
was redirected into various branches of the distal LAD and an
uninflated 2.0 mm balloon was used to "Dotter" across the apical
vessel clot, but this did not restore flow. It was decided that
we would administer 18 hours of integrilin and IV heparin for at
least 48 hours rather than cause distal embolization with stent,
balloon or rheolytic thrombectomy. Final angiography revealed
normal flow to the apical LAD where there was TIMI 0 flow and
filling via faint collaterals.  There was 20-40% residual
thrombus in the proximal LAD.  He left the laboratory in stable
condition with no chest pain.
.
[**2154-1-15**] CXR - The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
normal. The lungs are essentially clear. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. [**2154-1-15**]
ECHOCARDIOGRAM The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Doppler
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
