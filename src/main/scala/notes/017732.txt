ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 yo M with a history of Type 2 DM, paroxysmal
afib, Chronic systolic CHF, severe LV dysfuntion (EF 20-25%),
s/p BiV ICD placment in [**2108**], and VT s/p amiodarone and
dofetilide who was transferred from an OSH on [**2115-4-29**] to the
Cardiology service [**1-21**] to recurrent VT on mexilitine,
transferred to CCU for further monitoring after VT x 2
terminated by ICD firing.
Recently, he was admitted to an OSH ([**2115-4-9**] through [**2115-4-22**]) and
his ICD was reprogrammed to treat Vt/VF with atp x 1 followed by
1 shock. On this admission he was started on mexelitine and sent
home.
The patient returned to the OSH [**2115-4-28**] with slow VT (rate of
120s - 130s) on the Mexilitine with pre-syncopal symptoms. The
dizziness lasted several minutes while lying in bed. He denied
chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath. He was referred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further EP evaluation and possible VT ablation.

EKG [**2115-5-1**]
The tracing is marred by baseline artifact. The rhythm appears
to be atrial sensed and ventricular paced with occasional
ventricular ectopy as recorded on [**2115-4-30**] without diagostic
interim change. There is occasional intrinsic A-V conduction.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: 5/`14/09
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). The estimated cardiac
index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). There is no left ventricular
outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated, LV with severe global hypokinesis. The
lateral wall has relatively better function.The RV is not well
seen but is probably mildly dilated/depressed. Mild mitral and
aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2110-12-2**], the findings are similar. The degree
of mitral regurgitation and ventricular dilatation are slightly
less on the current study.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of _____, there is
continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in a patient with a
dual-channel
pacemaker defibrillator device. The pulmonary vascularity is
difficult to
evaluate, but is essentially within normal limits. Mild
elevation of the left
hemidiaphragmatic contour with atelectatic changes at the bases
and blunting
of the costophrenic angle. The upper lungs are essentially
clear.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no obstructive coronary artery disease. The LMCA was normal. The
LAD had
minor luminal irregularities. The LCX had minor luminal
irregularities.
The RCA was a large dominant vessel, without angiographically
apparent
stenosis.
2. Resting hemodyanamics demonstrated elevated left and right
sided
filling pressures, with a LVEDP and RVEDP or 26mm HG and 17m Hg,

respectively, with a mean PCWP of 26 mm Hg. There was mild to
moderate
pulmonary arterial hypertension with a pressure of 48/24 mm Hg,
likely
secondary to the elevated PCWP. There was no evidence of
restrictive or
constrictive physiology. There was no evidence of an
intracardiac shunt
by oximetry. There was no significant gradient across the aortic
valve
on carefull pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to
the
aorta. Systemic arterial pressures were in the normal range.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No obstructive coronary arteries disease.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures consistent
with
congestive heart failure.



Brief Hospital Course:
At [**Hospital1 18**], he had cardiac cath evaluation on [**5-1**] that revealed
clean coronaries and elevated left and right sided filling
pressures. On the floor he underwent agressive diuresis. On the
night of [**5-1**] he had an episode of VT/VF which was terminated w/
ATP followed by shock (ICD).
On [**5-1**] mexilitine and dofetilide were stopped with plan to
start amiodarone after wash out and plan of VT ablation on [**5-6**].
Patient was to be continued on heparin gtt and agressive
diuresis. On [**5-2**] patient had a run of VT/VF w/ resultant ICD
firing. EP was called and pt. was given 150mg IV bolus of
amiodarone. Following amiodarone bolus, pt. transiently became
hypotensive to the 70's, but returned to baseline w/o
intervention. Again 45 minutes later, pt. had a run of VT w/
resultant shock. He was transferred to the CCU for observation
and for further management.
.
In the CCU, patient was continued on amiodarone and lidocaine
gtt. On [**5-4**] he was started on amiodarone 400mg po bid.  He was
diuresed wtih IV lasix, with goal I/Os even. On [**5-5**] the patient
was started on Mexelitine 150mg po tid.  Lidocaine gtt and
amiodarone gtt stopped.

On discharge patient was maintained on mexelitine and amiodarone
po.  EP recommeded tapering amiodorone
