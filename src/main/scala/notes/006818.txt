unwitnessed fall, but the relatives in the house heard her
and immediately rushed to the scene to find her lying on the
ground awake but confused and EMT arrived on the scene and
placed her on a C collar and transported her to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Room as
hemodynamically stable.  At the Emergency Room, she had a GCS
of 13.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

2.  Trazodone.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is taking occasional alcohol and she had
a GCS of 14 in the Emergency Room.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate
of 90, blood pressure 118/56, saturating at 96%.  General:
She was alert, oriented, and following commands.  She had
right temporal and parietal scalp laceration and frontal
contusion and ecchymosis, right periorbital ecchymosis but
full range of extraocular motor.  The trachea was midline.
The chest was clear.  No bruises.  No ecchymosis.  Heart:
Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Pelvis stable.  Rectal:  Normal tone.  Back:
She was nontender, no step-off.  Extremities:  She had a
right wrist deformity but she had palpable pulses and
neurovascularly intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the Emergency Room, the patient
underwent chest x-ray and pelvic x-ray which showed no
widened mediastinum and no fractures in her pelvis.  She had
a CT scan of the head which showed bilateral subarachnoid
hematoma.  No subdural.  She had a CT of the abdomen which
showed a grade IV liver lac.  She had a CT of the C spine
which was negative.  On the CT of the head, the patient also
had infraorbital rim fracture and lateral orbital fracture.
The patient's BUN was 10, creatinine 0.8 on admission.  The
patient's alcohol level was 180.

Given the patient's liver lac, she was brought into
Interventional Radiology for an attempt at arterial
embolization and subsequently was admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit for further care and observation.  The
embolization was successful and the patient's hematocrit has
been stable throughout the night.  The patient was placed on
CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal.  The patient also had
bilateral wrist films done which showed bilateral wrist
fracture.  Orthopedics was consulted.  Neurosurgery was
consulted for her bilateral subarachnoid hematoma.  The
patient had to undergo a repeat head CT on [**2164-9-5**]
which showed no change of her bilateral subarachnoid
hematoma.  OMF came by to examine her eyes and her orbital
fracture which they advised to manage conservatively.  The
patient was placed on ten days of Clinda for her overload
fracture and no surgical intervention was required at the
time.

The patient was doing well; however, on hospital day number
three, the patient's mental status began to change.  Although
her repeat CT scan showed no change in her subarachnoid
hematoma, she began to develop a lot of secretions and
required frequent suctioning.

However, her respiratory status continued to deteriorate.  On
[**2164-9-9**], the patient was intubated due to
desaturations and the patient was placed on a mechanical
ventilator for respiratory failure.  The patient also spiked
a fever to 101.5.  The patient was pan cultured and sputum
was sent off for culture and cell counts.  On [**2164-9-10**], the patient underwent a bronchoscopy which showed a lot
of thick secretions and specimens were also sent off for
culture.  The patient was being treated for a presumed
pneumonia and was placed on Cipro, Zosyn, and vancomycin.
The patient's fever defervesced and her respiratory condition
improved.  She remained afebrile.  A feeding tube was then
placed and tube feeds were starting.  She was tolerating tube
feeds at goal, .................... with fiber at 80 cc an
hour.

Neurosurgery signed off the patient given her stable
subarachnoid hemorrhage on multiple repeat CT scans.  The
orthopedic surgeon agreed to taking her to the Operating
Room.  She underwent an ORIF of her right wrist on [**2164-9-11**].  The patient did well postoperatively.  However, her
mental status still altered and she was not quite following
commands.  Therefore, she remained on the ventilator.  At the
same time, she was also being treated for
ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Pseudomonas was grown out
from her sputum cultures, although her blood cultures have
been negative.  She was to be given a full 14 day course of
Cipro, Zosyn, and vancomycin.

The patient's condition remained stable and her mental status
became cleared over the next few days and the patient was
getting daily spontaneous breathing trials and her
respiratory rate was [**Year (4 digits) 13835**] 60.

On [**2164-9-18**], the patient underwent left wrist ORIF
and postoperatively the patient was extubated and tolerated
extubation well and subsequently the patient was transferred
to the floor on [**2164-9-19**].  However, the patient still
had a lot of secretions and the patient was readmitted back
to the unit on [**2164-9-20**] for further suctioning,
although mental status wise, the patient was alert, oriented,
and followed commands.  The patient still continued to
require frequent suctioning.  The patient is to finish a full
course of antibiotics.

To the date of dictation, the patient is to receive a swallow
evaluation on [**2164-9-16**] to assess for the patient's
ability to eat and drink on her own.  Current medication
wise, the patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation on
Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Zosyn 4.5 grams IV q. eight
hours, vanco 1 gram q. 24 hours, and Cipro 400 mg IV b.i.d.,
heparin subcutaneously 5,000 units b.i.d., Lopressor 25 mg
p.o. b.i.d., and Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n.  The patient is
to receive chest PT q. four hours and suction p.r.n. The
patient's antibiotics were for a 14 day course for which they
will end on [**2164-9-26**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post fall with multiple trauma.
2.  Status post open reduction and internal fixation of the
bilateral wrist.
3.  Facial fracture.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Depression.
6.  Respiratory failure requiring intubation.
7.  Pneumonia.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with her primary care
doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 13835**] two weeks.  The patient is to be
