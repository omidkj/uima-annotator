Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
elective admission for cardioversion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
electric cardioversion
Cardio-Pulmonary Resucitation
intubation and mechanical ventilation
temporary intravenous pacemaker insertion


History of Present Illness:
80 YO F with h/o atrial fibrillation (on coumadin and
metoprolol), CVA [**7-7**], hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CHF,
ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40-45%) and PVD, who underwent
cardioversion for Afib on the morning of his admission that
resulted in asystolic arrest, s/p CPR, intubation, temporary
pacer placement.
.
Of note, she was recently hospitalized for pneumonia,
exacerbation of CHF and COPD in 3/[**2119**].  She treated with
antibiotics(vanc/cefepime/cipro then vanc/[**Year (4 digits) **]/flagyl with h/o
MRSA and aspiration), received steroid treatment and also
diuresed.  Subsequently, she was admitted again in [**3-/2120**] for
hypoxemia, b/l pleural effuisons, s/p diuresis and her steroid
dose was increased at that time.  During her hospitalization,
she was noted to have repeated episodes of AFib/Aflutter with
RVR to the 150's.  Her metoprolol dose was increased and she wsa
started on amiodarone.  Initially, she was recommended to
undergo D/C cardioversion, however, her INR was subtherapeutic
requiring a TEE.  Ultimately, this was postponed due to
difficulty of monitoring her oxygentation during the procedure.
She was discharged back to [**Hospital3 **], had 4 consecutive
wks of therapeutic INR now referred for cardioversion.
.
On the day of admission, she was in her normal state of health
piror to cardioversion. The patient was sedated by a member of
the anesthesia staff with 30mg IV propofol and when appropriate
was shocked with 200J external biphasic energy with subsequent
asystolic arrest. After failure to capture with transcutaneous
pacing and lack of pulses, CPR was initiated. She underwent [**12-31**]
cycles of CPR, and received 1mg atropine and 1mg epinephrine
with return of spontaneous circulation. Dopamine gtt was started
at 10. She was also intubated at this time. Her rhythm was
altered between junctional escape, atrial tachcyardia, and
escape capture bigeminy. She was then transferred to the EP lab
for placement of a temporary pacemaker and arterial line for BP
monitoring.  Patient also received 100 mg hydrocortisone. She
was admitted to the CCU for further management and monitoring.

[**4-29**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior
walls, and apex. The remaining segments are low normal in
contraction (LVEF 35%). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-4-11**],
the regional dysfunction is similar, though the remaining
segments are now mildly hypokinetic leading to more depressed
global LVEF. The severity of mitral regurgitation is now
increased.
LABS/STUDIES
EKG [**2120-4-10**]:  Atrial fibrillation. Right bundle-branch block.
Left anterior fascicular block. Anterior myocardial infarction
of undetermined age. Cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2120-4-2**]
precordial lead ST-T wave changes appear slightly more prominent
but may be no significant change.
