Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DDD pacer placement ([**2178-3-18**])

History of Present Illness:
72 yo F with CAD s/p PTCA, DM, HTN, COPD on 2 L home O2, OSA on
BiPAP, and obesity who presents with acute onset of substernal
CP radiating to her back and left arm associated with SOB.  Pain
did not resolve with SL NTG and she went to [**Hospital **] Hospital.
Pt given ASA in the ambulance.  Received an additional SL NTG at
[**Hospital **] Hosp which decreased her pain to [**3-21**].  At OSH creat
elevated at 2.0.  First set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
Her ECG showed bradycardia, likely afib with a juctional escape,
rate 40.  She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**12-15**] for chest
pain and underwent stress test (nonconclusive given her habitus)
and was d/c'ed home with mild medication adjustments.  Of note,
she has a h/o a junctional rhythm requiring a temporary pacer
[**10-15**].  Etiology at that time thought to be renal
failure/hyperkalemia and B-B toxicity.  A permanent pacemaker
was considered, however, the patient began pacing on her own.
.
In our ED K noted to be 5.8.  Pt received Glucagon 4 mg, Insulin
10 Units, D50, Cal Gluc 1 gm, Combivent neb, alb neb, lasix 40
IV, and Solumedrol 125.  Pt is currently chest pain free.
Reports SOB at baseline.  HR in the low 40's with SBP in the low
100's.

.
ECG:  RBBB and L ant fascicular block with sinus arrest,
ventricular rate 40 bpm, no ST-T changes

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission, Ms. [**Known lastname **] ECG showed a RBBB with L anterior
fascicular block with sinus arrest and a ventricular rate of
approximately 40 bpm.  Due to the instability of this rhythm, EP
was consulted and she was taken for implantable DDD pacemaker
placement on [**2178-3-18**].  Due to her underlying pulmonary disease,
she was intubated for the procedure and remained intubated
post-procedure.  She was easily weaned off the vent and
extubated on the morning of [**2178-3-19**].  Her beta-blocker was held
due to her conduction abnormalities and she was started on
diltiazem in its place and this was titrated up; per EP, beta
blockade can be resumed as an outpatient as she tolerates.  She
will complete a 5-day course of peri-procedure antibiotics and
will follow up in device clinic in approximately one week. After
the pacer was placed she was noted to be intermittantly in
atrial flutter. She was started on coumadin for anticoagulation
(without heparin bridge) and will likely have cardioversion in a
few weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Additionally she noted bilateral knee pain consistent with
osteoarthritic pain that she has had in the past documented back
to the [**2151**]'s, previously evaluated for knee replacement in [**2170**]
but determined to be a poor surgical candidate given her
comorbidities. This was thought secondary to recent increased
mobilization with physical therapy and controlled with tylenol
and occaisional oxycodone.
