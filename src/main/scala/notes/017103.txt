Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath. Referred for bronchoscopy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Bronchoscopy on [**2160-12-20**]

2. Chest tube placment for pneumothorax on [**2160-12-20**]

History of Present Illness:
52 yo female with advanced pulmonary emphysema on home oxygen
therapy through a transtracheal catheter placed four months ago
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for evaluation of increased
SOB and bronchoscopy by IP. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital
on [**2160-12-9**] with increased SOB for approximately one week. She
reports that she was in her normal state of health until that
time. At baseline, she could walk half a block at a normal pace
without becoming SOB. However, one week PTA the pt became
acutely SOB at rest and with any exertion. On [**2160-12-7**] she had
a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the increasing SOB. It showed
increased soft tissue thickening of the peribronchilar perihilar
tissues on the right extending toward the right middle lobe and
a 1 cm spiculated density in the posterior segment of the right
upper lobe. This has strands of density extending posteriorly
and laterally to the pleural surfaces and anteriorly toward the
right hilum. There were chronic emphysematous changes and cysts
in the uppler lobes. On the morning of admission, the pt noted a
singificant increase from her baseline SOB. In addition, she had
a cough productive of a small amount of brown, yellow sputum. Pt
felt febrile but did not check her temperature. She denies
orthopnea, PND, CP, and hemoptysis.
.
On admission to the [**Name (NI) **], pt's labs included a WBC count of
[**Numeric Identifier 7923**], Ht of 40, and troponin of 0.1. She was treated with a
seven day course of deftin which was completed today, IV
steroids, and nebs. A bone scan was obtained which was negative
for evidence of metastatic disease. It did show some mild
degenerative changes of the right knee. On [**2160-12-16**], the pt
developed severe respiratory distress with concern for impending
respiratory failure. An ABG was obtained while the pt was on 4L
o2 by transtracheal catheter showed a pH of 7.2, pO2 of 113, and
pCO2 of 91. The pt's pH normalized quickly with aggressive
bronchodilator therapy and diuresis. Bronchoscopy was performed
at this time to evaluate for upper airway obstruction. This
showed extensive debris within the distal trachea concerning for
retained secretions, granulation tissues, or obstruction. The
carinae and main stem bronchi coing not be visualized. Biopsies
and washings of the area was obtained. The decision was then
made to transfer the pt to [**Hospital1 18**] so Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] could further
evaluate the airway with repeat ripid bronchoscopy.
.
On arrival, pt was resting comfortably in bed. She continues to
have some intermitten brown sputum production. She feels that
her SOB is not better. Occasional chest pain with coughing but
not at rest or with exertion. No abdominal pain, nausea, or
vomiting. Good appetite. No diarrhea or blood in her stools, No
dysuria or hematuria.

Past Medical History:
1.COPD
2. Small cell lung CA s/p chemotherapy and radiation in [**2155**]. Pt
has metastasis to her spine. On evaluation by oncology in
[**1-/2160**], the patient was felt to be cancer free.
3. Radiation fibrosis of the right lower lung
4. Osteoporosis
5. Chronic back pain
6. Type 2 DM
7. Depression

Social History:
Pt is married and lives with her husband and dog. She has an
involved family including a daughter, brother, and sister in
law. Former smoker but quit in [**2154**]. No ETOH or drugs.

[**2160-12-19**] CXR: Emphysema most marked in upper lobes. No change in

.
[**12-29**] CXR: FINDINGS: A single AP upright image. Comparison study
dated [**2160-12-28**]. There is again evidence of generalized
pulmonary emphysema, slightly worse on the right side. This is
associated with lung hyperinflation and vascular attenuation. No
focal pulmonary infiltrate is identified. No definite effusion
is seen. A small bore tracheostomy catheter is noted. No right
apical pneumothorax could be appreciated.
IMPRESSION: Severe emphysema. No focal pulmonary or pleural
abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Shortness of breath: Pt with very complicated pulmonary
picture. Severe underlying emphysema with a history of small
cell lung CA. Pt also has radiation fibrosis of the right lower
lobe. Pt underwent bronchoscopy on [**12-19**] with removal of a large
amount of mucous. Following this, pt had an episode of
repiratory distress and was found to have a right sided
pneumothorax. A chest tube was placed and the pt was transferred
to the MICU for closer monitoring. Her respiratory status
stabalized and she was transferred back to the floor on the
following day. She remained stable from a respiratory standpoint
with a good oxygen saturation on nasal canula and transtracheal
catheter. Chest tube was pulled on [**12-22**]. On [**12-23**], pt had an
expanding pneumo so chest tube was replaced. Pt improved with
this and the chest tube was pulled on [**12-26**] with an X-ray
confirming re-expanding lung and pt has been doing well since.
She was gradually weaned off the nasal canula and is currently
relying only on 4L via her transtracheal catheter.
      During the hospital course, she was started and continued
on Levofloxacin 500mg a day for treatment of a likely pneumonia,
presumed by the appearance of the mucous plugs. Today she is on
day [**9-26**] of the antibiotic course. She will need to take one
more dose.
      The pt was continued on her outpatient COPD medications
which include spiriva, salmeterol, albuterol and atrovent nebs.
She was continued on Prednisone 40mg. She will follow-up with
her pulmonologist in a week. Pt needs to have the 1cm right
upper lobe spiculated mass seen on Chest CT followed up as an
outpatient.
      Patient received aggressive pulmonary care throughout her
hospital course, with catheter washings and changings twice a
day. She received aggressive teaching about how she could do
this herself and was feeling comfortable about changing her own
[**Last Name (un) **] on discharge.

2. Anxiety:Pt had several episodes of anxiety which contributed
to her respiratory distress. She was given Lorazepam with good
effect during these episodes. She takes Lorazepam at home as
well as needed for her anxiety.
.
3. Chronic back pain- Pt with a long history of chronic back
pain for which she takes multiple narcotics. She was continued
