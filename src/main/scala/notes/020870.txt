Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation with [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5509**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66590**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with multiple medical problems including
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, previous AF with [**Age over 90 5509**], s/p
mechanical AVR, CAD, CHF EF 45%, h/o GIB, s/p listeria
endocarditis and CKD who presents from nursing home with low Hct
and low BP.  Patient was in his USOH until today when at HRC he
was found to have low BP to 102/60 and Hct to be 22.7.  Of note,
he had received 4 units of PRBC's several days ago at HRC per
schedule.  Due to this he was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
evaluation.  He denies fever, chills, rhinorrhea or congestion.
He denied cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, chest
pressure, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits,
arthralgias or myalgias.

In the ED, his VS were T 98 HR 60 BP 80/57 RR 18 Sat 97% RA.  He
was feeling well and had no complaints.  The repeat Hct was 26.6
which is his baseline.  His CXR showed some vascular congestion.
 His SBP increased to 130 without intervention.  Subsequently,
he went into AF with [**Hospital1 5509**] up to the 120's and his SBP remained in
the 80-90's.  He was given 10 mg IV diltiazem after which his HR
decreased to the 90's and his SBP improved to 90-100's.  He
remained with a low BP so an A-line was placed and he was given
levofloxacin and vancomycin empirically. He received 500 mL NS.
On the MICU, he is feeling well and is asymptomatic.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66590**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with multiple medical problems including
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, previous AF with [**Age over 90 5509**], s/p
mechanical AVR, s/p listeria endocarditis, CAD, dCHF and CKD who
presented for low BP and subsequently developed AF with [**Age over 90 5509**].

#. AF with [**Age over 90 5509**]:  Patient has a history of AF in the setting of a
GIB, and the AF was controlled with metoprolol. It is currently
unclear why he developed AF with [**Name (NI) 5509**], as his Hct is at baseline.
His CXR suggested vascular congestion but this could have been
caused by the AF. ACS is unlikely as he has no CP or EKG changes
consistent with ischemia and his trop 0.02 in the setting of Cr
of 1.4. Infection is unlikely as he is afebrile, has normal WBC
and no suggestive signs/symptoms. He had transient HR control
with diltiazem in ED. In the MICU he was continued on IV
metoprolol for rate control. He was ruled out for MI and was
monitored for signs of infection. His TSH came back normal as
well at 1.7.

#. Hypotension:  The patient presented with SBP 80's that
increased to the 130's transiently in the ED without
intervention and decreased after he went into AF with [**Name (NI) 5509**].  In
the MICU his SBP was in the 100's, likely due to poor forward
flow in the setting of a low EF and insufficient LV filling time
due to rapid HR.  Infection is unlikely as described above. His
hypotension was controlled via HR control as above, and a UA was
sent to r/o UTI.

#. CHF: He has an EF 45% and his CXR shows signs of mild fluid
overload, likely due to his AF with [**Name (NI) 5509**]. However, his Sats were
96-100% on RA. Diuresis was deferred for now given his low BP,
and carvedilol was held while controlling his AF with
metoprolol.  He was discharged back on his carvedilol.

#. AI hemolytic anemia: His admission hct was 26.6, which is at
his baseline but hematocrit dropped to 22.  He received 2 units
of packed red cells prior to discharge.  His prednisone 10 mg
daily was continued, and his stool guaiac was negative.

#. CKD: Currently his Cr 1.4 which is at his baseline. We will
continue to monitor his daily BUN/Cr.

#. Mechanical AVR:  Currently his INR is therapeutic at 2.6. His
home dose of warfarin was continued.
