CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for ptx, chf

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with chest pain at site of HD catheter
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for ptx, chf
HISTORY: 57-year-old male with chest pain at the site of
hemodialysis catheter.

COMPARISON: Radiographs [**2154-10-9**].

SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: A left subclavian large-bore
dual-lumen catheter reaches the high atrium. Cardiomegaly,
interstitial edema, and bilateral pleural effusions (right
greater than left), have not changed significantly since the
prior exam. The bony thorax is normal.

IMPRESSION: Overall no change since [**2154-10-9**]. Please
note that radiographic examination cannot address the site of
catheter insertion.
AV FITULOGRAM SCH  [**2154-11-4**] 7:43 AM

AV FITULOGRAM SCH

Reason: Please eval fistula
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 yo male with CAD, HTN, ESRD on HD. ? high pressures within
fistula per renal team.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval fistula
INDICATION OF EXAM: This is a left AV fistulogram for a
59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease. High pressures
during dialysis.

RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 15785**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **], the attending radiologist, who was present and
supervising throughout the procedure.

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After informed consent was obtained from
the patient explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure,
the patient was placed supine on the angiographic table, and the
left arm was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.

Using palpatory technique and after injection of 1 cc of 1%
lidocaine, the AV fistula was accessed with a 21 gauge needle
pointing towards the venous outflow. A 0.018 guide wire was
placed. The needle was then exchanged for a 4.5 French
micropuncture sheath. The inner dilator and the wire were
removed, and hand injection of contrast demonstrates good
positioning of the micropuncture sheath within the left cephalic
vein. Serial venograms were performed at the level of the arm,
shoulder and chest, for possible venous outflow stenosis.

Diagnostic venograms demonstrate two areas of narrowing, one
within the fistula in the proximal cephalic vein, and proximal
to the level of the junction of the cephalic vein with the
axillary vein. Collateral formation/flow was identified. Based
on these diagnostic findings, it was decided that the patient
would benefit from balloon dilation of these lesions. The
micropuncture sheath was then exchanged for a 6 French vascular
sheath over a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire. A roadmap venogram was
obtained, and a 6 mm balloon was advanced over the wire up to
the level of the narrowings, and several balloon dilations were
performed at dilations up to 15 ATM. A second area of narrowing
was dilated with a 7 mm balloon up to 10 ATM. The balloon was
removed. Followup venogram demonstrated partial angiographic
improvement of venous outflow after dilation.

Films were also obtained for evaluation of the arterial
anastomosis without any significant stenosis seen. The patient
tolerated the procedure well.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left AV fistulogram demonstrates two areas of venous
narrowing at the level of the proximal cephalic vein near the
fistula and near the junction of the cephalic vein
