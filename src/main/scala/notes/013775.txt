Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Unasyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
left lower extremity ischemia, dyspnea/chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Diagnostic angiogram
2. Left superficial femoral artery/bypass graft, Dacron patch
angioplasty
3. Aortic valvuloplasty

History of Present Illness:
VASCULAR SERVICE: 70M s/p left SFA-PT with NRSVG on [**2118-3-22**]
for a non-healing left toe ulcer presents for bilateral lower
extremity angiogram and angioplasty for bilateral great toe
ulcers with dry gangrene.  He reports having had rest pain in
the left forefoot x 1 year in the same distribution as the
duskiness in that foot.  He reports rest pain in the right foot
as well to a lesser extent.
.
CARDIOLOGY SERVICE: 70 y/o male with severe aortic stenosis,
diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hyperlipidemia, carotid
disease, recent peripheral bypass surgery, remote tobacco abuse,
mild coronary disease, who is POD 3 from a left superficial
femoral artery/bypass graft Dacron patch angioplasty (preveious
bypass SFA--PT, origin of graft had become occluded. Vascular
surgery unable to harvest a [**Last Name (LF) 5703**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] did a patch angioplasty of
bypass, with restored flow and palpable pulse). His course has
been complicated by acute respiratory distress and intubation
(currently s/p extubation) who developed chest pain in the
setting of his respiratory distress. The patient reportedly
tolerated the procedure without difficulty, but in the
post-operative period, after receiving about 2-3 L of IVF, he
developed SOB and crushing chest pressure (says like an
"elephant on my chest"), and was intubated for a brief period.
He was aggressively diuresed, and post-extubation, he was
feeling better, with more comfortable breathing and no chest
pain.
.
On transfer, the patient resports being slightly SOB this AM,
though currently he feels fine. He reports baseline orthopnea.
Denies any chest pain or lightheadedness.
.
On cardiac review of symptoms, the patient endorses orthopnea,
lower extremity edema, presyncope with exertion, and lower
extremity claudication.

ECHO [**2119-5-15**]
.
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-5-10**],
the peak gradient across the aortic valve has decreased from
95mm Hg (mean 64mm Hg) to 69mm Hg (mean 40mm Hg).

COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed critical aortic stenosis with a

calculated valve area of 0.53mm2. There were elevated left and
right
sided filling pressures with a PCWP of 25mmHg and an RVEDP of
18mmHg.
The central aortic pressure was normal at 133/65 with a mean of
94mmHg.
2. Successful aortic balloon valvuloplasty using a 20mm x 5cm,
22mm x
6cm, and 25mm x 6cm Tyshak II balloon.
3. Following aortic balloon valvuloplasty, the calculated valve
area
improved to 0.83mm2.
4. Supravalvular aortography demonstrated trace aortic
regurgitation.
5. Abdominal aortography demonstrated vessel diameter > 6mm from
the
aorta to the femoral arteries.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Critical aortic stenosis.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
3. Successful aortic balloon valvuloplasty.

CXR PA and lateral [**2119-5-11**]:
.
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the patient
has been
extubated. The lung volumes are normal. However, on today's
examination,
bilateral pleural effusions of moderate extent are seen. This
leads to
bilateral basal areas of hypoventilation.
.
No other focal parenchymal opacities. Persistent minimal
pulmonary edema.
Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
.

IMPRESSION:
.
1. Limited evaluation of the left superficial femoral [**Month/Day/Year 5703**];
however, no
definite deep venous thrombosis identified.
2. Bilateral subcutaneous edema.
.
ECHO [**2119-5-10**]
.
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot
