IMAGING:
C-spine MRI [**2-15**]:
Thickening of the ligaments at the atlanto-odontoid joint with
isointense and slightly enhancing mass on the right side of the
spinal canal at C1 level and extending posteriorly and merging
with the thickened ligaments. The combination of changes most
likely suggests extensive degenerative change with degenerative
pseudotumor with moderate compression of the spinal cord and
moderate-to-severe spinal stenosis at C1 level. Multilevel
degenerative changes are also noted at other levels as described
above.

CTA Neck [**2-15**]:
No evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis identified. In
particular, no vertebral artery occlusion or displacement
identified.
Degenerative changes at the craniocervical junction with
thickening ligaments as noted on the previous MRI.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] [**2-20**]:
Status post posterior decompression and resection of the soft
tissue present at the C2 level. The spinal canal has been
decompressed, and the spinal cord appears normal. No definite
residual tissue is detected although small amounts may be
obscured by the expected postoperative changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the NSurg service for pain control
and for further evaluation of this cervical lesion. She was
placed on Decadron 4mg Q8, and was given a soft collar for
comfort.  It was decided that she have an open biopsy of this
cervical lesion to yeild diagnosis.  Prior to the OR, she was
seen by her cardiologist Dr.[**Name (NI) 53712**], who, from a cardiac
standpoint, cleared her for surgery.  He ordered an ECHO, which
was acceptable, and requested the patient be on telemetry.

The patient went to the operating room on [**2194-2-19**] for a C1,2
Laminectomy and lesion biopsy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Pathology
revealed hematoma and not malignancy therefore steroid was
discontinued. She was in an Aspen collar while awake. Speech and
Swallow service saw her on [**2-20**]. They recommended an altered
diet and this was initiated.

MR W/WO Contrasat [**2194-2-20**]: Status post posterior decompression
and resection of the soft tissue present at the C2 level. The
spinal canal has been decompressed, and
the spinal cord appears normal. No definite residual tissue is
detected
although small amounts may be obscured by the expected
postoperative changes.

On POD#2, her surgical dressing was removed showing a small
amount of erythema, however no obvious drainage or foul odor.
She was seen by PT and OT, who recommended rehabilitation. She
was discharged to an appropriate facility on [**2-21**].
