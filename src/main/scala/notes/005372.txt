Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2135-6-19**] for medical evaluation and
aggressive diuresis prior to surgery.  She was diuresed,
evaluated by [**Last Name (un) **] for her diabetes, and was taken to the CCU
on [**6-22**] for PA line placement for evaluation of PA pressures.
The swan showed good opening numbers,it was removed the
following day, and the patient was transferred back to the floor
prior to surgery.
On [**2135-6-27**] she underwent Redo MVR/AVR a [**Street Address(2) 17009**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] in the
mitral position and a 21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] in the aortic position.
Cross clamp time was 129 min. and total bypass time was 177 min.
 She was transferred to the CSRU and profuse bleeding.  She was
treated with multiple blood products and was taken back to the
OR for exploration.  She then returned to the CSRU on Levophed,
Milrinone, Insulin, and Propofol.  She had a stable post op
night and was extubated on POD#1.  She was weaned off her drips
on POD#2 and was aggressively diuresed.  Shr required aggressive
pulmonary therapy as well. She remained in the unit on
intermittent Neo and continued to progress.  She went into
atrial fibrillation on POD#4 and had an increased Neo
requirement and was increasingly short of breath.  She had an
echo which showed no tamponade and the valves were working well.
 On [**7-1**] she was cardioverted into Sinus rhythm. She was
markedly improved and continued to improve.
She had a persistently elevated WBC ranging from 18,000 to
23,000 and she did not have a source.  On POD#7 she was
transferred to the floor in stable condition.  She continued to
be anticoagulated with coumadin, continued to be aggressively
diuresed, and continued to improve.  She remained extremely
depressed and said that if she could, she would take all of her
pills and die.  She was closely followed by psychiatry.  They
increased her Paxil dose and she had a sitter.  She eventually
improved and did not require a sitter, but she still says she
would like to take all of her pills, if she has access to them.
She had some vaginal discharge and was seen by GYN who examined
her and did a culture.  She had normal vaginal flora and they
wanted her to follow up with her own gynecologist in [**1-11**] weeks.
She continued to improve with ambulation and on POD#16 she was
transferred to the inpatient psychiatry service.  She did have a
sl. opening at the top of her sternal wound, with slight
drainage, and is being treated with softsorb TID.
