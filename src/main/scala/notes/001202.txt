   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2148-9-22**] 7:58 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old man with s/p POD 3 OP CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval change
EXAMINATION: PA and lateral chest.

INDICATION: Status post CABG.

Single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2148-9-22**] at 0830 hours
and compared with the prior radiograph of [**2148-9-20**].

The patient is status post CABG. Again is seen increased
retrocardiac density on the left side consistent with airspace
disease/atelectasis at the left base. Linear atelectasis is seen
in the right base. There appears to be a small left pleural
effusion. Allowing for technical differences, there has not
being any marked change since the prior examination.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 55% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: *3.9 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.4 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 7 mm Hg
Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.7 m/sec
Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.4 m/sec
Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.75

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF
(>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta. Normal descending aorta
diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. No TEE related
complications. The
patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally
reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2.Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation.

6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

7. Post revascularization biventricular systolic function is
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**9-19**] and underwent OPCABG x1 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on a propofol drip.
Extubated that afternoon and transferred to the floor on POD #1
to begin increasing his activity level. Chest tubes and pacing
wires removed without incident. Went into Afib and was treated
with amiodarone and coumadin. Made excellent progress and was
cleared for discharge to home with VNA services on POD #6. First
blood draw is scheduled for Friday [**9-27**]. Pt. to make all appts.
