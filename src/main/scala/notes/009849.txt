History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7716**] is a 42 year old gentleman with a history of
pilocytic astrocytoma (at age 2), multiple CVAs, and a medullary
cavernoma with persistent right hemiparesis, epilepsy, and
aspiration who presents with with diaphoresis and fevers to
100.2 at home. He states that he has increased frequency of
cough after being given a G tube 3 weeks prior due to recurrant
aspiration pneumonia and difficulty swallowing, but that the
cough has not worsened in the past few days.  He feels otherwise
well with no sensation of fevers/chills or increased sweating,
but was brought into the ED due to concern from his group home
caretaker.

Regarding his feedings, he gets them from 8pm to 5pm every day.
They have been unable to increase the rate due to gastric
residuals with feeding.  The patient notes regurgitation 2-3x a
day with a sensation of food coming up into his chest and
sometimes into the back of his throat and into his mouth.  He
cannot be for certain whether the coughing is associated with
his feedings.  Pt is without any complaints including chest
pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, dysuria, or new swelling. He reports being constipated
without a normal BMs for the past 4-5 days.  He has + flatulence
and minimal burping.  He was given an enema yesterday with
minimal stool output.

IMAGING:
[**10-1**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY and CT ABD & PELVIS
WITH CO
1. Right middle, right lower, and left lower lobe consolidations
compatible with pneumonia.
2. No pulmonary embolism.
3. No acute intra-abdominal process.
4. Bladder trigone thickening may represent focal inflammation,
less likely malignancy.

[**10-1**] CHEST XRAY
FINDINGS:  There is opacification of the right lower lobe seen
both on frontal and lateral radiographs.  In addition, the right
heart border is obscured, worsened from [**2175-9-9**].  There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal.
The left lung is clear.
IMPRESSION:  Right middle and lower lobe pneumonia, possibly due
to recurrent aspiration.

[**10-4**] PORTAL AP CHEST XRAY
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**9-2**] through [**10-3**]:
Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 7 cm from the
carina.  It could
be safely advanced 2 cm for more secured seating. Nasogastric
tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Bibasilar
pneumonia has not changed appreciably overnight.  There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
silhouettes are normal.

[**10-5**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Non-specific
repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2175-10-3**] the
quality of the tracing has improved somewhat. Otherwise,
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7716**] is a 42 year old gentleman with a history of
pilocytic astrocytoma (at age 2), multiple CVAs, and a medullary
cavernoma hemorrhage with persistent right hemiparesis,
epilepsy, and aspiration who presents with low grade fever,
found to have likely aspiration pneumonia on CXR and chest CT.
He deteriorated with hypoxia and was intubated and then recieved
a tracheostomy.

#MRSA Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration
pneumonia given swallow dysfunction related to prior
neurological disease.  On the night of [**2175-10-3**], he desaturated
to the high 70s.  Given his concerning respiratory status which
is unlikely to improve since it is due to neurologic dysfunction
of pharyngeal muscles, he was transferred to MICU, intubated and
a tracheostomy was performed [**10-5**]. CT scan suggestive of
consolidations consistent with pneumonia. We initiated tube
feeds on the night of [**2175-10-5**] which he seemed to tolerate
without obvious regurgitation.  However, there was continued
concern over oral secretions and his tracheostomy cuff was left
inflated.  Speech/swallow felt it would be best to avoid placing
a speaking valve until his respiratory condition resolved in the
short term. He completed an 8 day course of Vancomycin for HCAP.
Elevated WBC has resolved on discharge and he has remained
