History of Present Illness:
This is a 30 yearr old gentleman who underwent a suboccipital
craniotomy and C1 laminectomy for Chiari decompression on
[**2130-3-30**]. He did well initally. On [**2130-4-30**] he presented to an OSH
complaining of occipital pressure.  Head CT at that time
revealed a pseudomeningocele and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. On
[**2130-5-2**], he underwent a fluoroscopic-guided lumbar drainage
placement, the drain was ultimately removed and patient
discharged home on [**2130-5-5**].  On [**5-8**] patient complained of
posterior cervical headaches and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
CT head showed progression of his pseudo meningocele. Lumbar
drain placement was attempted without success.

He went to the clinic in follow up complaining of headache that
is
worse when he gets up from supine position and fluid collection
in occipital area.  His headache are worse in the am. He also

Pertinent Results:
MRI Lspine [**2130-5-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Abnormal low signal in the thecal sac from L1 through L4 is
most likely
due to subarachnoid hemorrhage from the recent instrumentation.
Very less
likely, this could represent an intradural mass.  Recommend
followup with the
repeat lumbar MRI to ensure resolution of the blood products.
2.  Increased prominence of the anterior epidural space is
likely due to a
small amount of post-procedural hemorrhage or CSF leak.
3.  Stable degenerative changes in comparison to [**2127**], with a
disc protrusion
at L4-5.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Neurosurgery service after
surgical wound exploration of a subocciptal pseudomeningocele
with dural repair.  Please see Operative Reports for full
details.  A Hemovac drain was placed intraoperatively.
Post-operatively, he was taken to the SICU for close monitoring.
 He was able to tolerate a regular diet starting the evening
after surgery and was noted to be neurologically intact.  A
Foley catheter was placed prior to surgery. He was given
prophylactic Vancomycin in light of his allergy to Cephalexin
and Penicillins.

On [**5-19**], patient doing well, hemovac had an output of 100cc and
was left in place. He was encouraged to mobilize and HOB at 90
degrees at all times. He was transferred to the SDU in stable
condition. On [**5-20**] he reported burning dysesthetic pain and
Neurontin was started. He remained stable on [**5-21**] and on [**5-22**] he
was noted to have increased drainage from his hemovac and it was
determined that a lumbar drain would be required and IR was
contact[**Name (NI) **] to perform it. Given the difficulty of prior lumbar
drain placements in this patient an MRI L-Spine was first
obtained.  IR declined to place lumbar drain.  On [**5-23**], a lumbar
puncture for large volume tap was attempted and unsuccessful.
As such, patient was scheduled to undergo operative drain
placement on [**5-24**].

The patient had two lumbar drains (epidural catheters) placed
successfully on [**5-24**] under concious sedation in the OR.  The
procedure was uncomplicated.  Drain output was initiated at
15-20 mL/hr with a plan for 7 days of drainage  from the Lumbar
Drain.

On [**5-26**], acyclovir prophylaxis was discontinued.  The patient
remained stable.  On [**5-27**], the patient's hemovac fell out.  2
staples were placed over the hemovac site.  The patient remained
stable through out his hospital stay.

On [**5-30**] he expressed he wanted to discontinue the plan of care
and leave against medical advice. He stated he wanted the team
to remove the drains or he would. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed the
risks of discontinueing his current plan. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 83809**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] also discussed this with him. A meeting was held with
his wife - [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 83809**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Name (NI) **], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21991**], and
[**Doctor First Name 1258**] from Case Management were in attendance. We discussed
his plan of care and discharge needs. Upon removal of his drains
he refused any closure to be done to close the lumbar drain
sites. The risks of this was explained to him by multiple
midlevels on the team and he allowed us to place 2 staples. The
patient then stated he would remove his staples/sutures
independently, he was advised against this, and the option of
follow-up on Thursday for removal was given which he declined,
Monday was agreed upon.
