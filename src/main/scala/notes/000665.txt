HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**2113-9-29**]: There is again demonstrated
a large chronic infarction of the left temporoparietal region.
There is no hemorrhage, evidence of acute edema, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent and consistent with
age-related
parenchymal atrophy. There is periventricular hyperdensity in a
pattern
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Numerous
carotid
calcifications are identified. The visualized paranasal sinuses
are clear.
Soft tissues are remarkable only for evidence of prior cataract
surgery.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture, hemorrhage, or edema.

CXR [**2113-9-29**]
IMPRESSION: Left basilar opacification may represent atelectasis
or
aspiration pneumonia. A left sided effusion is not excluded.
Hazy left upper
lobe opacification could represent superimposed asymmetric
pulmonary edema.


CXR: [**2113-9-30**]
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular
congestion.
Persistent left pleural effusion. The retrocardiac area is not
well
penetrated and atelectasis or consolidation in the left lower
lobe cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB: Resolved by time of arrival in ICU.  BNP>[**Numeric Identifier **]. SOB
responded to IV lasix.  Given nebulizers, CE x3 negative.  BUN
and Creat slightly higher than baseline at 52/1.2. Currently
receiving lasix 40 mg daily and received an extra dose of 20 mg
today for episode of congestion and SOB with O2sat of 82%. With
02 via NC replaced she returned to 02 sat of 94%.  Pt.
frequently removes the oxygen. Her pattern of breathing
(intermittent tachypnea) has been noted in the past and may be
due to intermittent discomfort (e.g., from constipation). She
may receive supplemental oxygen prn at her nursing home.

# CHF, acute on chronic, diastolic and systolic: EF 20-25% on
[**12/2112**] echo.
- continued ACE-I, lasix and spironolactone
- received IV diuresis in the ICU and BP remained stable.  SOB
and 02 sat improved and she was restarted on usual dose of lasix
per peg tube.

# Diabetes, type 2
-  has been covered with regular insulin sliding scale.  Tube
feedings have been gradually titrated to 60 cc/hr with rising
blood sugar today to 300.  She does not show any signs of active
infection.  She has remained afebrile and her WBC is normal at
10.3.

# UTI: When admitted she was already on cephalexin and the urine
culture done here grew yeast with UA positive for bacteria and
WBCs.  UCx grew 10,000 - 100,000 yeast. She was treated with
Ceftriaxone on admission. She continued on cephalexin throughout
her hospital stay and the 7th and final day is today, [**2113-10-2**].

# Herpes zoster, left T7-8 dermatome:  Last day of Valtrex is
today. Lesions have scabbed over, she does not require
precautions.

# Diarrhea: C diff x1 negative. Diarrhea was resolved by [**10-1**].

# Depression:  She is on effexor, but her MS at this time is
impossible to evaluate.  She is non verbal and does not interact
in any meaningful fashion.  Consideration should be given to
discontinuing antidepressant medication if it is not known to be
beneficial for her.

# stage II decubitus pressure ulcers: sacrum and mid-back, local
wound care continued.

# Advanced Care Planning:  She and her son may benefit from a
palliative care consultation to clarify the goals of care.

# Code status: DNR, may be intubated.
