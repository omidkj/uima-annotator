Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
left  lower extremity non healing wound

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2148-11-28**]:
Left lower extremity arteriogram

[**2148-12-2**]:
1. Left superficial femoral artery endarterectomy with
    saphenous vein patch angioplasty.
2. Left superior femoral artery angioplasty and stent, two
    6 x 80 Zilvers and one 6 x 150 complete SE.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with multiple medical
comorbidities including CHF with an ejection fraction 15% who
has had a nonhealing wound on the anterior medial aspect of her
left lower extremity that has
been slow to heal.  She has undergone a debridement by both
Vascular Surgery and Plastic Surgery and has been treated
with antibiotics.  She underwent noninvasive arterial studies
and was confirmed to have severe inflow and outflow disease
in her bilateral lower extremities with monophasic waveforms
from her common femoral artery all the way down to her feet.
Therefore, she presents today for diagnostic angiogram of her
left lower extremity with possible intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**11-28**] and underwent a diagnostic left
lower extremity angiogram which showed:
1. Heavily calcified tortuous infrarenal abdominal aorta
    with no evidence of flow-limiting stenoses or aneurysm.
2. Heavily calcified patent bilateral common iliac arteries
    with a moderate stenosis at the distal left common iliac
    artery as well as a moderate stenosis in the mid common
    iliac artery on the right.
3. Patent bilateral external iliac arteries that are
    bilaterally heavily calcified and severely tortuous with
    a flow-limiting stenosis at the origin of the external
    iliac artery on the left.
4. Heavily calcified common femoral artery with likely
    severe disease as well as a critical stenosis at the
    origin of the femoral profundus.
5. Patent although heavily calcified and multiple levels of
    stenoses in the left SFA.
6. Patent popliteal artery with heavy calcification as well
    as multiple levels of severe stenosis.
7. Occluded posterior tibial artery at its origin.
8. Occluded anterior tibial artery at its origin.
9. Patent peroneal artery with in-line flow down to level
    of the ankle reconstituting the dorsalis pedis at the
    level of the foot with multiple levels of moderate
    stenoses along its course.
10.Filling of the pedal vessels via collaterals from the
    peroneal with an occluded dorsalis pedis shortly after
    its origin at the dorsum of the foot with no
    reconstitution of the posterior tibial artery via
    collaterals.

The patient was taken to the PACU post operatively and monitored
clolsey. She remained hemodynamicaly stable and was then
transfered to the VICU. She continued to be mointored closely
and did well. Due to the patient's severe medical comorbidities
and depressed cardiac function and renal insufficiency, it was
determined that it would be a reasonable to return to the
operating room under monitored anesthesia care for a left common
femoral endarterectomy to treat the lesions in her left lower
extremity SFA and popliteal to improve flow for wound healing of
that left lower extremity ulcer. She was seen by cardiology who
felt that she was stable for surgery and recommended we watch
her volume status closely. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was diuresed carefully and
monitored over the next several days. She was continued on iv
antibiotics which she had been on as an outpatient. The Plastic
Surgery team saw her in house and felt that antibiotics should
continue through this hospital stay. They discussed the
possiblity of a skin graft in the future.  On 12/ 12 she was
taken to the OR and underwent left superficial femoral artery
endarterectomy with saphenous vein patch angioplasty and left
superior femoral artery angioplasty and stent.  She tolerated
the procedure well, was taken to the PACU and monitored closely.
She remained stable from a hemodynamic and respiratory
standpoint. She was again transfered back to the VICU where she
continued to be monitored closely. Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to do
well. She was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for acute blood loss
anemia on [**12-4**]. She was weaned off her oxygen, got out of bed
to the chair and tolerated a regular diet. She was diuresed
aggressively with additionaly lasix. On [**12-5**] she was deemed
stable from a surgical and medical standpoint for discharge back
to her rehab facility. Her JP drain was continuing to drain and
it was decided to leave it in, and re-evaluate in clinic next
week.  On the day of discharge the Plastic surgery team and
vascular team agreed that the patient has no active infection
and that her left lower extremity wound looked clean. At that
time her antibiotics were discontinued. She is discharged to
rehab in stable condition.
