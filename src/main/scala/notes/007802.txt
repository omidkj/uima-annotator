TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: Well-defined hypodensity is noted of the parasagittal
right frontal cortex and subcortical white matter consistent
with acute infarction. A smaller area of hypodensity of the left
parietal cortex and subcortical white matter is also consistent
with acute infarction. There is no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect. The cerebral sulci and ventricles are
symmetric and age appropriate. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are clear. No osseous or surrounding soft tissue
abnormality is seen.

IMPRESSION: Acute infarction of the right frontal and left
parietal lobes. Well-defined appearance of the areas of
infarction suggest that infarction is over 24 hours old and not
hyperacute.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. Cannot exclude LAA thrombus.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Severely depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Focal apical
hypokinesis of RV free wall.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
Conclusions-
Prebypass:
1. The left atrium is elongated. A left atrial appendage
thrombus cannot be excluded. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler.
2.There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesia of the apex , inferolateral, inferior and
inferior septum. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%%). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]
3. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] was
notified in person of the results on [**2196-4-20**] at 1015 am.

Post Bypass:
1. Patient is receiving an infusion of phenylephrine, milrinone
and epinephrine. Patient is A paced.
2. LV systolic function is slightly improved.
3. Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. It appears
well seated. There is trivial mitral regurgitation.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate for ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old man with s/p mv repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for ptx
HISTORY: Previous pneumothorax, to evaluate for persistence.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-26**], there is no
longer any convincing evidence of pneumothorax. There is still
evidence of pleural effusions, more marked on the left with
elevation of pulmonary venous pressure in this patient who has
undergone a previous CABG procedure.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted pre-operatively for IV heparin drip as pt. had
discontinued his Coumadin in preparation for surgery.  He was
taken to the OR on [**4-20**], underwent a re-do sternotomy, CABG X 1,
MV repair (please see operative report for details of surgical
procedure).  Post-operatively, he was taken to the CVICU, on
propofol, epinephrine & milrinone drips.  He woke up agitated,
and self extubated on post-op day # 1.  He weaned off vasoactive
drips, and remained stable from a hemodynamic standpoint.  As he
woke it was noted that he did not appear to be moving his left
arm or leg.  A head CT was obtained, as was a neurology consult.
 The CT revealed a right frontal and left parietal stroke.
Initially, he had a dobhoff tube placed for nutritional support.
 Once he was fully awake & alert, speech therapy re-evaluated
him, and he was able to take po liquids, and ground or soft
solid foods.  He was started on anticoagulation at the request
of the neurology service, continued on aspirin, and has remained
hemodynamically stable.  Central lines were taken out prior to
transfer to the floor.  A limited carotid u/s showed 80-99%
stenosis so a vascular consult was obtained.  Mediastinal chest
tubes were taken out POD #5 and pleural tube POD #6.  Repeat
full carotid u/s on [**4-27**] showed bilateral 70-79% stenosis. He
will need a CTA and follow up with va
