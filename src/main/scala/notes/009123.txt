Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9996**] was admitted to the CVICU where TEE revealed no
tamponade, and EGD revealed no evidence of upper GI bleed.  The
patient was transfused five units of fresh frozen plasma, as
well as two units of packed red blood cells.  Hematocrit rose to
21 and INR began to fall.  The patient remained stable and was
transferred to the step down unit on hospital day 4.  Sternal
drainage was cultured and revealed coag positive staph aureus,
the patient was started on vancomycin given her history of MRSA.
 EGD was performed on [**11-4**] and was normal. Heparin was started
when INR dropped below 2.  Colonoscopy was performed on [**11-9**].
Two polyps were removed and sent for biopsy, however, remainder
of exam was normal.  Pathology reveals: 1.Fragments of adenoma,
and 2. Condyloma acuminatum with low grade dysplasia (anal
intraepithelial neoplasia I).  The GI team referred Ms. [**Known lastname 9996**]
to a ZGI [**Known lastname 5059**] for outpatient work-up of these findings.
Following these procedures, heparin and coumadin were resumed.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout the hospital
course.  She was discharged to home when her INR became
therapeutic on hospital day 13.
