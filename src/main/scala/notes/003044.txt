[**9-1**] ERCP
ERCP: Ten ERCP images were obtained by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6745**].
Cholangiogram demonstrates a dilated common duct with numerous
filling defects. By report a sphincterotomy was performed and
stones were extracted. Residual impacted stones were observed
and a biliary stent was placed.
.
[**9-7**] CXR: AP single view of the chest obtained with the patient
in semi-erect position is analyzed in direct comparison with a
similar study obtained [**9-6**]. The bilateral pleural
effusions remain practically unchanged. Heart size as before. No
new parenchymal infiltrates are seen, and the accessible lung
fields demonstrate unchanged pulmonary vasculature.
.
[**9-6**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
EKG [**9-8**]: NSR 68, nl intervals, TWI in II/III, no ST changes.
.
[**9-8**] CXR
HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with low oxygenation.

IMPRESSION: AP and lateral chest compared to [**9-6**] and
12:

Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left,
has increased slightly on the right. Mild-to-moderate
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is more pronounced. There
could be a component of pericardial effusion. Aside from
relaxation atelectasis at the lung bases, there is no focal
pulmonary abnormality, though there is pulmonary vascular
engorgement.
.
[**9-12**] CXR
Compared with [**2190-9-11**], no significant change is detected. Again
seen are small bilateral pleural effusions, with underlying
collapse and/or consolidation. There is cardiomegaly, with an
unfolded aorta. No CHF is identified. Aside from the bases, no
focal infiltrate is identified.

IMPRESSION: No significant change compared with one day earlier.
Bilateral pleural effusions with underlying collapse and/or
consolidation. Lungs otherwise grossly clear. Background COPD
noted.
.
[**9-13**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are bibasilar
effusions with adjacent areas of compressive atelectasis. The
right effusion is moderate in size.

There is a stent in the common bile duct, with associated
pneumobilia centrally, but there is no intra- or extrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation. No focal liver lesions are
identified. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The
spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are within normal limits.

There is a 3.6 cm diameter hypoattenuating lesion in the lower
pole of the left kidney with relatively high density. This may
represent a cyst with hemorrhage, but is not fully characterized
here.

There is a large hiatal hernia. Apparent wall thickening of the
distal colon is probably due to underdistension. The stomach,
small and large, bowel, are unremarkable. There is no evidence
of obstruction. There is no lymphadenopathy or free air or
fluid.

There is a partly saccular infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm
with maximal diameter of the aorta of 3.2 cm. There are
extensive vascular calcifications as well. There are fairly
large calcifications in the mesentery in the pelvis. These may
represent unusual phleboliths. There is no free fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: There is marked leftward convex scoliosis of the
mid lumbar spine with degenerative change but no suspicious
lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
2. Bibasilar opacities which are more suggestive of atelectasis
than pneumonia.
3. Stent in the common bile duct with associated pneumobilia.
Cholangitis cannot be excluded by this study but there is no
parenchymal abnormality in the liver or evidence of biliary
ductal dilatation or enhancement to raise the possibility based
on the CT.
4. Large left-sided renal cystic lesion. This may represent a
renal cyst wit
