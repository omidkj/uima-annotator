Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1399**] is a 55 year old male with nonocclusive right femoral
and popliteal DVT, obstructive sleep apnea and obesity who was
doing well until two days ago.  He reports waking up with left
groin pain.  He went for lunch and then noticed acute onset of
shortness of breath with minimal exertion leading him to present
to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Hospital 122**] Hospital.

At OSH ED, his inital vitals were 134/83 107 95%3LNC and
breathing 24-26. Due to creatinine of 1.6, he got a V/Q scan to
evaluate for pulmonary embolism which showed high probability
for pulmonary embolism.  LENIS showed DVT.  CTA confirmed saddle
pulmonary embolism.  He was given fundoparinaux 10 mg and
transferred to ICU.  TTE showed right ventricular strain with
paradoxic motion of the septum, right ventricular dilatation
ands severe pulmonary hypertension.  He was offered TPA vs OSH
transfer for thrombectomy. He opted for OSH transfer for
thrombectomy and thus [**Hospital1 18**] ICU transfer.

At [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, he reports 20% improvement in his shortness of
breath at rest though no chest pain or dizziness.


Past Medical History:
Multiple right lower extremity DVTs approximately two years ago.
 He was treated with Coumadin for six months and has been off of
the Coumadin for over a year. He saw a hematologist who could
not find any cause for the multiple DVTs. Hypercoagulable workup
did not reveal any causes

High triglycerides
Obstructive sleep apnea, uses CPAP at home
Obesity

Past Surgical History
Bilateral knee surgery for torn meniscus three years ago
Ruptured appendix s/p emergent lapraroscpic appendectomy


Social History:
Occupation: He is a safety director.
Tobacco: never
Alcohol: None
Recreational Drugs: None


Family History:
Significant for coronary artery disease or
myocardial infarction.  He denies a family history of blood
clots or bleeding disorders.

TTE [**2134-7-26**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. A 1cm mobile
echogenic mass is seen at the pulmonary artery bifurctation
(clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) c/w possible saddle embolus. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
size with free wall hyopkinesis and severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Possible saddle embolus.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Pulmonary embolism: He has known history of hypercoagulable
state. LENIS at OSH revealed DVT. CTA and V/Q at OSH showed
saddle pulmonary embolism with right heart strain on TTE.
Troponin I elevated at 0.1. Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
thrombectomy, but remained hemodynamically stable to procedure
not indicated.
Initially on IV heparin transitioned to Lovenox and Coumadin
given hemodynamic stability. INR rose slightly to 1.2 during
admission, but pt was not yet therapeutic, so lovenox continued.
Pt was discharged home on both medications with close PCP
[**Name9 (PRE) 702**] and instructions to have repeat INR drawn in two days.
Plan is to continue lovenox for five days AND until coumadin is
therapeutic for at least 24 hours (goal 2.0-3.0). Patient should
have repeat TTE next week to reassess RH function.

# HLD: Chronic, stable. Continued Tricor. Aspirin d/c'ed while
on coumadin/lovenox.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Health maintenance: Given unexplained hypercoaguability,
patient should have age-appropriate cancer screening
(colonoscopy, PSA if PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 103795**]).
# Incidental lung nodule: PCP should arrange [**Name9 (PRE) 702**].

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 1399**],

You were transferred to our hospital for treatment of your
pulmonary embolus (blood clot in your lungs). We treated you
with heparin to ensure that your clot did not expand and with
oxygen to help you breath more comfort
