Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
female with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction who presented to
an outside hospital with a single episode of syncope.  The
patient states that she felt lightheaded and dizzy that day
and then passed out.  The patient's daughter witnessed event

No urinary incontinence.  No head trauma.  No confusion
status post episode.  The patient had a similar episode in
[**2127**] with no workup done.  The patient denies a history of
chest pain, numbness, or palpitations.  The patient reports
shortness of breath and sleeps on two pillows.  Dyspnea on
exertion, cannot walk across the room because of shortness of
breath.  No recent changes.

The patient had a workup at an outside hospital, and creatine
kinase was negative.  She had a carotid Duplex which showed
90% stenosis on the left and 60% stenosis on the right.
Echocardiogram and Persantine tests were performed and showed
anterior, apical, and septal ischemia.  Ejection fraction was
approximately 38%.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed alert and oriented times three, in no acute
distress.  Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Pulmonary examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Bowel
sounds were positive.  Extremities revealed trace edema,
positive pulses.  No cyanosis.  Neck revealed no bruits
heard.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Catheterization report on admission
showed left main coronary artery 60% distal stenosis, left
anterior descending artery 80% proximally, first diagonal 70%
second diagonal origin with 90% stenosis, the left circumflex
50% at origin, right coronary artery ostial 60%.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left axis
deviation, left bundle-branch block, ST depressions in I,
aVL, V6, ST elevations in III and V1.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count was 8.7, hematocrit was 29.4, platelets were 152.
Sodium was 140, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 106,
bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 15, creatinine
was 1, blood glucose was 108.  Calcium was 9, magnesium
was 2.4.  Cholesterol was 158, triglycerides were 294,
low-density lipoprotein was 77, high-density lipoprotein
was 36.  Creatine kinase and troponin were negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted;
however, due to the patient's known carotid disease with
high-grade stenosis, it was recommended that a Vascular
consultation would be obtained before cardiovascular work
could be done.

A Vascular consultation was obtained and recommended the
patient for a left carotid endarterectomy.  On hospital day
two, the patient had a carotid ultrasound at [**Hospital1 346**] which showed right carotid 60% to
69% stenosis and left internal carotid stenosis of 70% to
79%.  The patient would be a good candidate for left carotid
endarterectomy.

On hospital day three, the patient remained afebrile, and
vital signs were stable.  The patient was diuresed
preoperatively and taken to the operating room on [**2139-8-3**] where a left carotid endarterectomy was performed.  The
operation went without complications.  The patient was
transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable
condition.

On postoperative day one, the patient was hypertensive and
was treated with Lopressor and hydralazine to which she
responded well.  Her neurologic examination was unchanged.
The patient was stable.

Cardiothoracic Surgery was reconsulted, and said the patient
was now a good candidate for surgery.  On postoperative day
two, the patient was doing well, stable, ambulating, good
orals, no active issues.  The patient's troponin and creatine
kinase which were followed throughout the operation due to
high risk remained negative for myocardial infarction.

The patient was transferred to Cardiothoracic Surgery Service
on postoperative day three.  The patient remained stable.
The neurologic examination was unchanged.  The patient
ambulated.  No active issues.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2139-8-7**]
where a coronary artery bypass graft times three was
performed with left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery, saphenous vein graft to right coronary
artery, and saphenous vein graft to second diagonal.  It was
discovered in the operating room that the patient really did
not have good grafts.  It was later cleared that the patient
had a vein stripping many years ago which she failed to
mention prior to her surgery.  Pacing wires as well as
mediastinal pleural tubes were placed in the operating room.
The operation went without complications, and the patient was
transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable
condition.

On postoperative day two, the patient had low cardiac index,
and she was started on Milrinone which improved her low
cardiac index.  She was transfused 2 units of packed red
blood cells for a fall in hematocrit and to improve her
output.  She was not extubated, generally due to her
extensive facial edema.

On postoperative day three, the patient was extubated
overnight without any complications.  She still required
Milrinone and hydralazine for control of her blood pressure.
Due to the absence of good vein graft intraoperatively, the
patient was taken back to cardiac catheterization laboratory
on [**2139-8-10**] where a coronary graft angiography and left
circumflex stenting was performed.  Also, on postoperative
day three, the patient was weaned off Milrinone, and her
chest tubes were removed successfully.

On postoperative day four, the patient was stable.  Her
hydralazine was discontinued, and she was started on
lisinopril.  She was transferred to the regular floor in
stable condition.

On postoperative day five, the patient was afebrile.  Vital
signs were stable.  She ambulated with help.  Her sternal
wires were removed without complications.

On postoperative day six, the patient remained afebrile.
Vital signs were stable.  The wounds were clean, dry, and
intact.  The patient ambulated with physical therapy.  No
active issues.
