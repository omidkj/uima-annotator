History of Present Illness:
78 F recent hospitalization for cellulitis, was at [**Hospital 7137**] and doing well with the exception of a mild cough this
past week. This morning, she was noted to be more somnolent and
with a cough productive of green sputum.
.

.
On arrival to ICU, again noted to be hypotensive to SBP 70s.
Propofol stopped, and started on Levophed but was quickly weaned
off.

Physical Exam:
Physical Examination on arrival
VS - T 96.8, BP 112/55, HR 80
100% on AC 500x14, FiO2 1.0, PEEP 5
general - intubated & sedated, but opens eyes to voice, nods to
yes/no questions
HEENT - ET tube and RIJ in place, PERRL
CV - RRR, no m/r/g
chest - coarse ventilated breath sounds
abd - obest, soft, nt/nd
ext - bilat chronic venous stasis

On discharge, the patient was awake, alert and oriented.  Her
vital signs were stable.  She was afebrile.  Breathing was
unlabored.  Her bilateral lower extremities had skin changes
consistent with chronic venous stasis.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO ([**2129-9-19**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CT Head ([**2129-9-15**]):  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
mass effect, shift of midline structures, hydrocephalus, or
acute major vascular territorial infarcts. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is well preserved. Small calcific density within
the posterior left parietal lobe may represent old sequelae of
infection, trauma, or thrombosed vascular anomaly. Soft tissues
and osseous structures appear unremarkable. There is pooling of
secretions within the oropharynx consistent with patient's
intubated status.

MRI/MRA ([**2129-9-20**]): No evidence for acute ischemia.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis/Chest:
1. No evidence of abdominal or pelvic abscess.
2. The endotracheal tube is located 1 cm above the carina.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
4. There is a marked amount of stool noted within the rectum and
sigmoid colon.
5. There is extensive degenerative change noted in the humeral
head bilaterally.
6. There is bronchomalacia of the carina as well as the right
and left bronchus.
7. Hyperdensities in the lower posterior lung fields may
represent barium aspiration or sequelae of prior granulomatous
disease.
8. Pulmonary artery enlargement.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old female who was originally admitted with fever,
respiratory distress and acute change in mental status.  She was
found somnolent at her rehabilitation center, where she has been
living since her knee replacement over the summer.

She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit where she
was intubated for airway protection.  She was treated for a
presumed multi-focal pneumonia with vancomycin, Zosyn and
azithromycin given her elevated white blood cell count and
fever.  While in the ICU she had a BAL which did not show any
evidence of gram negative rods, which had been noted on a
previous sputum.  Cultures from her sputum were negative for
legionella, acid fast bacilli and PCP.   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] addition on
presentation, the patient was hypotensive, which resolved with
fluids, antibiotics and stress dose steriods.  She then
developed episodes of hypertension during sedative weaning.  The
patient was started on beta blocker to help with hypertension.
Chest x-ray after extubation demonstrated evidence of mild
pulmonary edema.  She was diuresed with a slightly higher dose
of Lasix (compared to her home dose).  The patient also had a
cardiac work-up to exclude acute coronary disease as well as an
ECHO, which did not show any evidence of an acute process.

After extubation, her altered mental status persisted, prompting
an evaluation by the Neurologists.  She had a negative head CT
as well as an MRI which was also negative for any acute process.
 As the infection cleared as well as sedating medication, her
mental status cleared to her baseline.

The patient has baseline anemia which has been stable over the
course of this admission.

The patient was admitted on coumadin which was started by her
orthopedic doctors after a recent total knee replacement in
[**Month (only) 216**].  The coumadin was held during this admission until the
records were obtained.  Once records were obtained verifying the
reason for anti-coagulation, the patient was restarted on her
home dose of coumadin. Goal INR per ortho is between 2 and 3 and
should be maintained for six months.

The patient also experienced renal insufficiency which resolved
with intravenous fluids to normal.

The patient has baseline adrenal insufficiency; secondary to
bilateral adrenalectomy.  She was initially started on higher
doses of her home medications to treat with stress dose
steriods.  She has been transitioned to her home doses of
corticosteroids, fludrocortisone, and levothyroxine.

Given her long standing history of constipation, the patient was
maintained on an aggressive bowel regimen.  She has been moving
her bowels daily.
