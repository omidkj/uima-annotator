[**2186-2-8**] KUB: No evidence of obstruction or free air.
..
[**2186-2-8**] CXR: No evidence of pneumonia.
.
[**2186-2-9**] CXR: Worsening opacification at the bases which may
represent atelectasis or new early pneumonia, as well as small
effusions. Recommend close attention on followup radiographs.
.
[**2186-2-10**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**2-9**], the right
base is somewhat clearer than on the previous study and the
minimal opacification above it most likely represents merely
atelectatic change. Opacification at the left base in the
retrocardiac region is again seen consistent with atelectasis.
Probable left pleural effusion as well. The upper lung zones are
within normal limits.
.
[**2186-2-14**] RENAL ULTRASOUND
.
61 year old man with Hypertensive Urgency. Please evaluate for
renal artery stenosis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Renal artery stenosis
HISTORY: 61-year-old male with hypertensive urgency, concern for
renal artery stenosis.

RENAL ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER: Grayscale, color, and pulse
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of both kidneys were performed. Both kidneys
are normal in grayscale appearance, with the right kidney
measuring 10.8 cm and the left kidney 11.1 cm. There is no
evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or solid renal mass. Doppler
evaluation demonstrates patency of the bilateral main renal
arteries and veins. There are appropriate waveforms
demonstrated. Intrarenal resistive indices of the right kidney
range from 0.66 to 0.71 and on the left from 0.70 to 0.73.

IMPRESSION: Unremarkable renal ultrasound. Patent renal
vasculature. No definite evidence of renal artery stenosis.
.
[**2186-2-9**] CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS
.
CT ABDOMEN: Visualized lung bases show patchy areas of dependent
airspace opacity that is heterogeneous. There are a few areas of
bronchiectasis in the lower lobes. There is no pleural or
pericardial effusion. Cardiomegaly is unchanged.

Absence of intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the
abdominal parenchymal organs and vasculature. Liver is nodular
