NECK CT [**6-28**] :

 FINDINGS: There is narrowing in the upper trachea approximately
1.5 cm below
 the level of the vocal cords. The trachea measures 7 mm in this
region
 compared to 20 mm at the level of thoracic inlet. This
narrowing is
 circumferential without evidence of a distinct dominant mass on
the anterior
 or the posterior aspect of the trachea. The thyroid gland is
small but
 demonstrates no evidence of a definite mass. No definite
lymphadenopathy is
 seen in the neck. Degenerative changes are seen in the cervical
spine.

 In the visualized thorax a right pleural effusion is identified
with small
 lymph nodes in the prevascular space and in the pretracheal
space. Correlation
 with chest films and CT is recommended.

 IMPRESSION: Circumferential tracheal stenosis approximately 1.5
cm below the
 vocal cords. No dominant mass is visualized or evidence of
lymphadenopathy
 seen in the neck. Clinical correlation to exclude previous
trauma is
 recommended. Findings were discussed with the ENT resident at
the time of
 interpretation of this study on [**2160-6-28**].

LENIs [**6-27**] negative

[**6-30**]: A.  Thyroid isthmus, biopsy, (A): Thyroid tissue, no
evidence of malignancy.
B.  Trachea, secretions, (B): Mucus, inflammatory cells and
bacterial organisms.
C.  Trachea, stenosis, biopsy (C):Squamous metaplasia, scarring,
acute and chronic inflammation, no tumor seen.

[**7-2**] RENAL US: FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10 cm. The
left kidney measures 11.4 cm. There is no evidence for masses,
stones, hydronephrosis, or perirenal fluid collections. The
bladder is decompressed around the Foley catheter.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 50388**] was a 73 yo male who presented with stridor/SOB.

1) SOB - On the morning following admission, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 50389**] was
seen by ENT to evaluate for upper airway obstruction, due to
stridor on physical exam.  Laryngoscopy was concerning for a
subglottic mass and a CT scan revealed: circumferential tracheal
stenosis about 1.5 cm below vocal cords (measures 7 mm c/t 20 mm
at level of thoracic outlet). No dominant mass or LAD in neck
noted. That morning, [**6-28**], Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 50389**] was started on decadron
IV, humidified O2, and continuous O2 monitoring. In the morning
of [**6-29**], the patient had an episode of worsening stridor/SOB
while eatting breakfast.  He felt like he was choking on his
"spit" and couldn't swallow it, getting stuck in his lower
throat. O2 sats were stable, however he was transferred to the
MICU for closer monitoring and tracheostomy placement with
direct laryngoscopy/bronchoscopy/esophagoscopy. Biopsies were
taken are revealed only fibrous tissue.  He was transferred back
to the floor on [**7-3**].  He remained intubated, with good O2
with his family at approximately 3 pm on [**7-4**].  Later that
afternoon, at around 4:30 p.m., a pulmonary fellow entered the
room to evaluate the patient for his subglottic stenosis and
found the patient cyanotic without breath sounds.  A code was
called and run for approximately 30 minutes before Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 50389**]
was pronounced dead.  At the initiation of the code it was found
that his tracheostomy tube had somehow become dislodged from the
airway.  It was still sutured in place on the surface of the
skin.  It remains unclear how the tube became dislodged.  The
patient had complained of feeling uncomfortable at around 4:15
p.m. and the nurse had come in and readjusted him in bed.
Otherwise he had been without complaint.

2) CAD- Troponins are chronically elevated in this patient, at
0.16 on admit. He did not have any ekg changes or CP, and there
was no clinical suspicion for MI.
We continued his ASA, nitro, statin, and beta blocker.

3) HTN- He was maintained on a BB, hydralazine, and nitrate.

4) AFIB- Coumadin was stopped on [**6-28**] for his procedure. He also
got 2 units FFP prior to the OR.

5) Acute renal failure - Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 50389**] had a baseline creatinine
of 1.8, and went into acute renal failure shortly after
administration of IV contrast for his CT scan.  It was felt to
be contrast induced nephropathy, and was being managed with
hydration and observation.  He had progressed into the polyuric
phase by [**7-4**] and was anticipated to begin recovery, however he
unexpectedly pa
