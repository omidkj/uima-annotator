Chief Complaint:
Hartmann's reversal

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2175-11-16**] Hartmann's reversal, small bowel resection, bladder
repair, liver biopsy

History of Present Illness:
68-year-old female with a history of a AAA repair complicated by
ischemic colitis requiring an emergent sigmoid colectomy with
end colostomy on [**2175-4-2**].  She has done quite well in her
recovery and presents for reversal of her Hartmann's procedure.
She has a history of cirrhosis of unclear etiology, so a liver
biopsy has also been requested by her treating hepatologist.
The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed in detail
with the patient and her daughter.  Consideration was also given
to open cholecystectomy as the patient has a small gallbladder
polyp. We discussed that if there were any concerns we would
place a diverting ileostomy and would not proceed with the
cholecystectomy given the multiple procedures planned.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted for an elective Hartmann's reversal
procedure on [**2175-11-16**].  In the operating room a significant
amount of adhesions were found in the abdomen and during the
procedure a small bowel resection and a bladder repair needed to
be performed, leaving a diverting loop ileostomy to allow full
healing of the sigmoid anastomosis (see report).
Postoperatively, patient received 2U of RBCs for labile blood
pressures in the PACU, EBL 250 and a Hct of 25.5 postop, rising
appropriately to 34 and with no evidence of bleeding. She was
initially managed with an epidural, but given labile blood
pressures and inadequate pain management, this was changed to a
PCA and the epidural pulled on POD1. On POD2 her NGT output was
minimal, the ostomy looked pink and putting out minimal serous
fluid. NGT was removed, pain was controlled with a PCA. On POD3
patient was feeling well, OOB ambulating, pain was controlled.
She was advanced to a clear liquid diet. On POD4 patient has 2
episodes of emesis, requiring replacement of the NGT. A KUB
showed dilated loops of small bowel consistent with ileus. On
POD5 the ostomy started to have 300 cc of stool and gas and by
POD6 the NGT was removed. The foley catheter was kept for 6 days
postop given the bladder repair and then removed without
complications. By POD7 she was tolerating clears again with
ostomy output >1L and on POD8 tolerating a regular diet. She was
seen by physical therapy and cleared to go home. She was
discharged on POD9, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating
independently, with adequate pain control on po pain meds and
with adequate ostomy output. She will have VNA at home and
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
