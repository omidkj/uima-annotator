Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the trauma surgery ICU after
suffering a gunshot wound to the Right posterior chest. He had a
chest tube placed in an outside hospital prior to his transfer
to [**Hospital1 **].  On HD 1 the patient was taken to the OR for repair of a
posterior diaphragmatic injury, esophagoscopy, and Right chest
tube placement.  He tolerated the procedure very well and was
taken to the TSICU to recover. On HD 1, it was also discovered
that the patient had a possible epidural hematoma of unknown
etiology. On HD 3 the patient had a barium swallow which showed
no acute esophageal injury. In addition, his hard collar was
removed and replaced with a soft collar. The chest tube was
removed on HD 3 and a f/u CXR showed a small apical
pneumothorax.  After removing the chest tube, the patient
continued to improve and f/u CXR showed resolution of his PTX
over the ensuing days. On HD 7 the patient was ambulating,
tolerating a regular diet, and his pain was well controlled on
an oral regimen. As a result it was felt that it would be
appropriate to discharge him home with neurosurgery and trauma
f/u.
