Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4583**]
Chief Complaint:
MS change.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Left sided craniotomy for resection.
2.  Intraoperative image guidance.
3.  Microscopic dissection.
4.  Duraplasty.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76 year old woman with a history of high blood
pressure and cholesterol now presenting on transfer from
[**Hospital3 **] with decreased responsiveness and a question
of mass on head ct.  She is unable to give a history, so the
story is gathered from family members (sons) at her bedside.
Apparently, she has been in her usual state of health--she had
dinner last night with family members and was
talking/interacting normally.  This morning, she awoke, called a
family member and said she felt dizzy and couldn't breath.  She
called for an ambulance herself.  When EMS arrived, she was not
talking and appeared "dazed and confused".  She was taken to
[**Hospital1 2436**] ED. The son arrived shortly thereafter and found her
starring straight ahead, not responding to questions, and
"frothing at the mouth".  The ED staff was concerned for
seizures and gave her 4 mg of ativan and loaded her with
dilantin.  She was intubated for airway protection and sedated
with propofol.  They obtained a head ct which showed a left
parietal hypodensity with some "vasogenic edema".  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.

Head CT w/contrast [**2103-6-14**]:
FINDINGS:  In the posterior left frontal lobe, at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter
junction, there is a 2 cm rim mass with relatively thick
enhancing rim and
extensive surrounding vasogenic edema. There is no evidence for
acute
hemorrhage in the mass or elsewhere.  The overlying left frontal
sulci are
compressed secondary to edema, but there is no significant shift
of midline structures, and only minimal mass effect upon the
ipsilateral lateral ventricle.  There is no parenchymal or
meningeal enhancement elsewhere. The major vessels enhance
normally. There is no evidence of bone destructive lesion.
Mastoid air cells are well pneumatized. There is mucosal
thickening of the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:  2 cm rim-enhancing posterior left frontal lobe mass
with
surrounding vasogenic edema.
.
Torso CT [**2103-6-15**]:
CT CHEST:  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes were noted.  There
is no
axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Aortic
calcifications are noted.  The heart, pericardium, and great
vessels are otherwise within normal limits.  There are sub
segmental bilateral lower lobe opacities.
CT ABDOMEN:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal
glands,
stomach, and bowel loops are within normal limits.  Tiny low
attenuation focus in the left kidney may represent a cyst but is
too small to be fully
characterized.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable.  There
is no free air or free fluid.  No mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy is
identified.
CT PELVIS:  Foley catheter is noted in the bladder.  The uterus,
adnexa, and rectum are unremarkable.  Colonic diverticula are
noted without evidence of diverticulitis, most prominent in the
sigmoid colon.  There is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
osseous lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Bilateral lower lobe opacities more likely to represent a
small amount of aspiration than atelectasis.
2.  Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
3.  No abnormalities identified as a potential source for the
potential cerebral abscess.
.
EEG [**2103-6-15**]:
IMPRESSION: EEG most consistent with a moderate encephalopathy
of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. The presence of
propofol suggests that this may be contributing to the overall
pattern. No evidence of ongoing seizures is seen at the time of
the recording.
.
Head MR/MRA [**2103-6-15**]:
FINDINGS:  BRAIN MRI:
The diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
There is an area of brain edema seen in the left posterior
frontal lobe with rim enhancing approximately 2-cm lesion in the
subcortical region of the left frontal lobe. There are no other
foci of abnormal enhancement seen.  Mild mass effect is seen on
the adjacent sulci and the left lateral ventricle without
midline shift.  No definite other areas of abnormal enhancement
are seen.  There is no evidence of slow diffusion seen within
the center of this lesion. The ventricles are normal in size,
and there is no midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.  Mucosal
thickening is seen in the right maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION:  Rim-enhancing left posterior frontal lobe
subcortical lesion with edema in the surrounding brain.  The
most likely diagnosis is metastatic disease.  In absence of
central restricted diffusion, abscess appears less likely.  The
location also is less favorable for primary brain neoplasm.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries
of anterior and posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION:  Normal MRA of the head.
.
Head CT [**2103-6-18**]:
FINDINGS:  There is no  interval change in the extent of
vasogenic edema
involving the left frontal lobe compared to [**2103-6-14**].  There
is minimal
mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventricle with
effacement of the
overlying left frontal sulci secondary to edema.  There is no
evidenc
