Brief Hospital Course:
    This [**Age over 90 **]yo F was admitted to the medical service for work-up
and treatment of her diarrhea and BRBPR.  The ARF was considered
secondary to dehydration and treated with IVF resuscitation and
electrolyte repletion.  A GI consult was obtained.  Stool was
sent for culture and tested for CDiff, which came back positive.
 She was placed on Flagyl PO but continued to have significant
diarrhea.  The HCT drifted from 31 to 28 and she was transfused
1U of PRBCs, with response to 31.  She was taken for colonoscopy
and EGD on HD 4 with the finding of pseudomembranes consistent
with CDiff, duodenal erythema (biopsied), and small hiatal
hernia.
    She continued to have diarrhea and increasing abdominal
distension.  PO Vanco was added to the IV Flagyl.  A rectal tube
was placed, with serial abdominal exams showing no evidence of
peritonitis.  A KUB on HD 5 showed dilated loops < 7cm and
air-fluid levels, a CT scan confirmed no obstruction or toxic
megacolon.
    On HD 8, stool output ceased and abdominal distension
developed, as well as low urine output.  A repeat KUB showed a
9.5cm cecum and ? pneumotosis.  A surgical consult was obtained,
and she was transferred to the SICU for further management.  She
was continued with NGT and rectal tube, begun on TPN, and
continued on Vanco/Flagyl.  A CVL was placed and echo for murmur
revealed 2+ MR, nl LVEF.  The WBC rose slightly, no fever, and
rpt KUB showed no evidence of obstruction.
   She gradually improved and was transferred to the floor on HD
12.  The rectal tube was removed on HD 13, clear liquid diet
begun and tolerated.  She developed swelling on her LLE, U/S was
negative for DVT.  She initially had poor PO intake, calorie
counts were initiated, and TPN was gradually weaned.  She then
developed siginificant constipation, which responded only to a
complete regimen of colace, dulcolax, and mineral oil.  She
failed to independently void after Foley [**Last Name (un) **] was removed; the
catheter was re-placed for 450cc.  Physical therapy consult was
obtained.
