Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Found down, altered mental status, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Insertion of R IJ line [**2119-5-7**]. Insertion of L radial arterial
line [**2119-5-7**].

History of Present Illness:
 83F found down [**2119-5-7**] for unknown length of time in a pool of
foul smelling urine. Patient has a PMH notable for CAD, vascular
dementia, diastolic CHF, interstitial lung disease, HTN, and
prior admission where she was found down with
AMS/fever/tachycardia on [**2118-11-4**]. She regained consciousness
when aroused but remained lethargic and confused. EMS was called
and noted O2 sat 84% of and systolic BP in 80s.
.
  In the ED, patient's initial vital signs were: 103.2 122
112/48 28 98% 4L NC. Blood and urine cx were obtained and
patient was given levaquin/CFTX for fever without a clear source
of infection. She then became hypotensive to SBPs of 60 despite
3-4L NS resuscitation and required levophed at 0.15 via a RIJ.
CXR showed mild pulmonary edema. Labs were notable for CK of
5000. Pt was also evaluated by neuro in the ED for question of
new onset R sided weakness/facial droop. Head CT was negative,
LP bland. CT abdomen/pelvis was also obtained for belly pain
which showed no acute intra-abdominal process.
Patient was transferred to the MICU [**Location (un) **].
.
  In the MICU patient continued to meet criteria for SIRS
(T102.5 HR 120-140 MAP 104 on levo, RR 26 98% on CPAP and CXR
was concerning for atypical or viral pneumonia. Her coverage was
therefore broadened to vanc/zosyn, CT chest was obtained showing
no PE. Viral swab was obtained which returned positive for
parainfluenza; abx were discontinued.  On [**2119-5-8**] patient was
weaned off pressors, HR decreased with metoprolol. Patient was
weaned off CPAP with the help of nebs, lasix diuresis, and
methyprednisone.
  Patient's clinical response to stress steroids raised
suspicion for adrenal insufficiency [**1-11**] acute illness or chronic
disease. She was continued on dexamethasone on transfer to the
floor so that AM cortisol could be measured should she remain
hypotensive when steroids were stopped.
  Her CK also trended down on IVF (5000-->2969-->941-->559).
Patient made adequate urine with no serious electrolyte
derangements during admission.

Past Medical History:
1. Elevated left hemidiaphragm.
2. Mild interstitial lung disease.
3. Hypertension.
4. Diastolic CHF, last admission [**3-19**] for mild CHF
5. Tachycardia of unknown etiology, admitted [**3-19**] and started on
beta-blocker, ECG with sinus tachycardia
6. GERD
7. Osteoarthritis
8. Pulmonary Nodules
9. Coronary Artery Disease
10. Osteopenia
11. Gout


Social History:
The patient lives alone and is independent with her ADLs/IADLs,
particularly she still drives, goes shopping, and is in charge
of her finances. She does have family that lives nearby, in
particular, she has a nephew who will call her on a daily basis
every morning. She reports no tobacco history and drinks alcohol
sparingly reporting less than 1 drink/week.


Family History:
Denies recent sick contacts.

Admission Imaging:
Head CT: No CT evidence of acute process. If clinical suspicion
for
ischemic event is strong, MRI could be further performed.
.
CXR: Persistent elevation of left hemidiaphragm with mild
adjacent
atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion
.
EEG [**2119-5-7**]: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence
of a
slightly slow background which represents a mild encephalopathy.
Also
noted were left temporal sharp transients but these were not
definitively epileptiform in nature. There were no clear
epileptiform
discharges or electrographic seizures seen
.
Abdominal CT:
1. No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process.
2. Stable upper pole left renal cyst of intermediate density (40
Hounsfield
units). Recommend further evaluation by ultrasound, although
stability since [**2112**] reassuring.
.
Chest CT:
1. No evidence of PE, as clinically questioned.
2. Two 5 mm lateral right middle lobe nodules, stable since [**2113**]
consistent with granulomas
3. Small, non-loculated left pleural effusion with atelectasis
in the left lower lobe and lingula.
.
CXR [**2119-5-14**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-9**], there is little
change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. Continued low
lung volumes with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Mild
atelectatic changes at the bases, especially on the left.
