Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  55% to 60%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Descending aorta intimal flap/aortic dissection.

AORTIC VALVE: Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.
Conclusions
This is a limited, directed intra-operative TEE to monitor
patient during chest exploration and possible closure after
dissection repair.
The patient is on infusions of milrinone and vasopressin.

Overall left ventricular systolic function normal. The chamber
is underfilled.
There is severe RV hypokinesis.
A mobile density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with
an intimal flap/aortic dissection. Several entry points are
seen.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
The SGC was deep in the left PA and was withdrawn to the
bifurcation at 45 cm.

After sternal closure there was no significant change.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2109-1-30**] Ms.[**Known lastname 57827**] was taken to the operating room with an
Aortic dissection. She underwent replacement of ascending
hemiarch aorta with a 28 mm Gelweave graft/ suspension of aortic
valve/ Ligation of right coronary artery button/ Coronary artery
bypass grafting x1 with a free left internal mammary artery to
the right coronary artery with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please refer to operative
report for further surgical details. TOTAL CROSS-CLAMP TIME:
108 minutes with 88 minutes for the
first cross-clamp time and 20 minutes for a second cross-clamp
time. TOTAL BYPASS TIME:  239 minutes with 180 minutes for the
first bypass time, 320 minutes for the second bypass time and 29
minutes for the third bypass time. TOTAL CIRCULATORY ARREST
TIME:  22 minutes.

Postoperatively, she had a diffuse coagulopathy and her chest
was left open. She was transferred to the CVICU intubated and
sedated in critical condition. In the intensive care unit she
was resuscitated with multiple blood products.  She persisted in
having high chest tube output, so she was electively taken back
to the operating room for exploration of clot removal and
washout.

Please see operative note for further details.

POD#1 her bleeding had slowed down but the covering over her
open chest wound appeared to be bulging and clot was suspected
to be accumulating in her chest and; therefore, she was brought
back to the operating room for a second re-exploration. She was
transferred back to the CVICU intubated and sedated in critical
condition.

POD#4 Renal was consulted for ATN in the setting of hypotension
and contrast induced nephropathy as her creatinine peaked approx
72 hours after contrast.
