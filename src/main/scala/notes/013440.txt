Chief Complaint:
cellulitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
I & D in emergency department

History of Present Illness:
69 yo F with AVR/MVR and CABG with subsequent trach in [**2171-11-7**],
nonhodgkin lymphoma s/p radiotherapy, s/p splenectomy,
hypothyroidism, anxiety who presents from [**Hospital1 **] with a right
lower leg abscess/hematoma after she struck her leg a couple
weeks ago.  The swelling and surround erythema on the medial
aspect of her right lower leg has been worsening for the past
few days.  She denies any fevers, and feel systemically well.
She is on a trach mask during the day, and trach vent at night.

.
Pt states redness and swelling started 1-2 weeks ago. Increased
pain with palpation. Pt has a trach and is on ventilator at
night, pt states she needs to be placed on ventilator at 2100
tonight. Pt currently on 8L oxygen. Foley catheter in place. Pt
has picc line to right upper arm.
.
Initial vitals in the ED were: 97.4 82 120/62 24 97% 3L trach
mask. Labs were notable for WBC of 12, hct of 27 (baseline 30),
cr of 1.2 (baseline 1.5), HCO3 of 39 (baseline 45), and INR of
1.8 (goal between 2.5-3.5).  Exam was notable for 4cm x 4 cm
swollen fluctuant warm area, with surrounding erythema on the
medial aspect of right lower leg. Neurovascular intact distally.
 Ultrasound showing fluid collection approximately 4 x 4 x 1 cm
deep.  She recieved a dose of vancomycin.  ED resident proceeded
with incision and drainage.  No purulent material expressed,
just dark blood. Sent culture and wound irrigated.  Although, it
clinically appeared to be an abscess, may be hematoma with
surrounding cellulitis.  Discussed with cardiac surgery, who is
aware that she is here, but no acute cardiac surgery issue. She
needs ICU because she is on trach vent.  Vitals prior to
transfer: afebrile 75 114/56 100% on vent 40% FiO2, 5 of PEEP
RR23 tv 200.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she is with her son, who is very
involved.  She is comfortable on vent.
.
Of note: she had a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and severe
systolic heart failure in [**2169**] in NH, then lost of followup,
represented in [**2170**] with severe heart failure symptoms to [**Hospital1 18**].
 She was found to have severe left main and 2 vessel coronary
artery disease, severe elevated right and left sided filling
pressures, severe pulmonary hypertension; with echo noting
severe MR, likely AS, dilated cardiomyopathy.  She underwent AV
replacement with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical valve, MV repair, CABG.
Her course was complicated by Afib on amio [**Doctor Last Name 2949**] and
metoprolol, GI bleed, pleural effusions, prolonged intubation
with trach placement, chronic vent dependence, treatment for
presumed C. diff infection and pseudomonas on skin wound, and
ARF.  She was discharged to [**Hospital3 **].
.
Note: foley was placed on [**2171-12-31**].  double lumen picc was placed
on [**2171-12-13**].  has a peg intended for tubefeed use. Just started
taking sips of POs today.

ECHO [**2172-1-15**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Color-flow imaging of the
interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal
defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this
study. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). secondary to dyskinesis of
the interventricular septum, and severe hypokinesis to akinesis
of the inferior and infero-lateral walls. The apex and
mid-distal lateral wall contract best. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral annular ring appears well seated
with normal gradient. Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study dated [**2171-12-5**], pulmonary
pressures are higher. Left ventricular function is similar.

WOUND CULTURES - pending

Brief Hospital Course:
69 YOF with AVR/MVR and CABG with subsequent trach in [**2172-11-7**],
NHL s/p splenectomy who presents from [**Hospital1 **] with a right
lower leg hematoma after she struck her leg a couple weeks ago.

.
# Hematoma: This was debrided in the emergency room and found to
have blood and clots, but no pus. Superficial cultures were
negative. Deep cultures were sent on [**1-16**]. Started on vancomycin
and zosyn for concern of infection, but given the lack of
systemic symptoms this is unlikely. Daily wound cha
