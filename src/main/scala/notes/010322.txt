Emergency Department for fever and rigors.  He resides at
[**Hospital1 2670**] [**Location (un) **] Group Home where the staff had noticed
increasing behavioral problems with [**Name2 (NI) 29399**] for several
days leading up to [**2145-10-15**].  He then became calm
and withdrawn and stopped taking po medications.  On the date

of feeling hot on arrival to the Emergency Department.  The
patient was febrile to 103, tachy with sinus tachycardia at
120 beats per minute.  Blood pressure was stable.  02
saturation 80s on room air, 99% on 100% nonrebreather.  He
was responsive to voice and pain stimulus but not following
commands and noncommunicative.  He was moaning.  Laboratories
were notable for a white count of 11.2 with 29% bands,
bicarbonate of 13, BUN and creatinine 119/35, 7.5 over
baseline of 15/1.  Chest x-ray with hazy left lower lobe
consolidation.  He received 1 amp of D50, insulin 10 units, 1
amp of bicarbonate at 5 mg, droperidol, 1 gram of vancomycin,
500 mg of Levaquin.

Patient then underwent lumbar puncture in the Emergency
Department by the Medical Intensive Care Unit staff prior to

gases in the Emergency Department were 7.19, 35 and 52 on two
liters of nasal cannula.  He continued to desaturate to the
80s on 100% non rebreather and his respiratory rate increased
to 40.  The patient was intubated prior to the transfer to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

negative LA, normal complement levels this year. Systemic
lupus erythematosus cerebritis with previous admissions.  MR
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**2145-2-28**] was consistent with cerebritis.  The patient
also has a history of bipolar disorder, seizure disorder,
psychosis, impulsive behavior, avascular necrosis of the hips
bilaterally, status post bilateral hip replacement unclear
history, status post laparotomy for a question of gastric
ulcers, hemolytic anemia, chronic renal insufficiency,
probably secondary to lupus nephritis, hypothyroidism,
pulmonary hypertension, Klinefelter syndrome, diagnosed
secondary to delayed secondary sexual characteristics, right

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 112/68.  Heart
rate 120.  Respiratory rate 30.  Temperature 1032.  O2
saturation 96% on 100% nonrebreather.  In general, he is
obtunded and moaning, no jugular venous distention.  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  No lymphadenopathy.
Neck is supple.  Lungs are clear bilaterally.

foot.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.2,
hematocrit 25.6, platelets 196,000.  Neutrophils 58%, bands
29, lymphocytes 12, sodium 145, potassium 8, chloride 113,
bicarbonate 13, BUN 119, creatinine 7.5, glucose 86, anion
gap is 19.  Urinalysis showed large blood, protein greater
than 300, red blood cells [**5-9**], white blood cells [**2-1**],
moderate bacteria, occasional yeast, epithelial cells [**5-9**].
Arterial blood gas was 719, 35 and 52.  Cerebrospinal fluid
on admission:  3 white blood cell and 1 red blood cells, 18
polys, 4 bands, 40 lymphocytes, 30 monocytes, 2 neutrophils,
protein 35, glucose 69.  Gram stain was negative.

Chest x-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette with patchy
areas of consolidation in the left lung and a hazy
costophrenic angle.

Electrocardiogram showed mildly peaked T waves in V3 through
V5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  He was started on assist control with
goal of correcting his acidosis and improving his mental
status and protecting his fluid overload.  He received four
liters of intravenous fluids in the Emergency Department.  He
was treated for a pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics.
His sputum was cultured.  Results of his sputum were
negative.  Most likely etiology of the patient's admission
was considered a sepsis from his left lower lobe pneumonia.
The patient was noted to be hypotensive while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and he was started on intravenous
pressors.  His creatinine did not resolve.  It continued to
remain in the high 7 to 8 range.  The patient also was noted
to be bleeding which was felt to be secondary to DIC during
this admission.  Patient's platelets rapidly fell and his
coags increased.  The patient's hematocrit also decreased to
21.  He was transfused to correct this problem, however, the
patient remained in DIC given the fact that he had fever,
mental status change, renal failure, thrombocytopenia and
hemolytic anemia, the possibility of TTP was considered.  The
patient was prepared for pheresis.  During the placement of a
Quinton catheter, patient developed a pneumothorax and a
pneumohemothorax.  Attempts to resuscitate the patient were
unsuccessful.  He died at 5:50 p.m. on [**2145-10-21**].
The patient's father was notified in [**State 2690**].  The patient's
case was referred to the Medical Examiner for autopsy.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Death.
