CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2167-8-25**] 4:33 PM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: please evaluate for perforation
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with severe abdominal pain s/p colonoscopy.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate for perforation
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAMINATION: CT abdomen.

INDICATION: Severe abdominal pain post-EGD.

FINDINGS: A CT of chest and abdomen was performed with axial
images taken from the lung apices to the symphysis pubis. IV
contrast only was administered.

On the CT of thorax there is some soft tissue in the apices
bilaterally which may represent apical scarring.

This patient has a pacemaker with two leads in situ.

The pulmonary arteries are very large and the left atrium is
also prominent. The appearances may be consistent with pulmonary
hypertension.

The patient has cardiomegaly.

On the lung windows there is emphysematous change in the lungs
and some scattered scarring.

Anterior to the distal esophagus there is some free air.

Below the diaphragm air is seen to extend along the posterior
part of the caudate lobe and along the falciform ligament. Free
air is also seen anterior to the left lobe of the liver. More
inferiorly free air is seen posterior to the tip of the right
lobe of the liver.

There is intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. The common bile duct
measures 1 cm. The appearances may be consistent with the
patient's age.

The spleen is normal.

The adrenals and kidneys are unremarkable.

The bowel where visualized is normal.

CT PELVIS: Some free fluid is seen in the pelvis and extending
to the right side of the rectum. Several diverticula are seen in
the sigmoid colon.

BONY WINDOWS: Degenerative changes noted throughout the spine.
There is a high-density medium in the spinal canal which may
represent previous Thorotrast examination.

IMPRESSION:
Status post perforation from recent examination most likely
secondary to EGD. Free air seen extending into the mediastinum
from the inferior esophagus and ex
