History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old gentleman with dementia, COPD,
HTN, CAD, PVD, seizure d/o, distant EtOH abuse admitted on
[**2157-12-15**] from nursing home after mechanical fall from his bed.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Pelvic fracture. He was initially admitted to the trauma
surgery service.  He was seen by orthopedic surgery and a pin
was placed through the distal femur and the leg was placed in
traction in anticipation of possible surgery.  3d reconstructive
CT imaging of the pelvis was performed.  Ultimately, it was
decided to treat this fracture non operatively given his
baseline functional status and the severity of his fracture on
imaging.  The pin was removed. Pain was controlled with IV
morphine and PO oxycodone.

# Retroperitoneal Bleed.  On CT, retroperitoneal and pelvic
bleeding was discovered. Interventional radiology was consulted
and patient was monitored clinically.  He remained
hemodynamically stable and his hematocrit remained stable and no
intervention was necessary. His hematocrit remained stable for
the remainder of his hospitalization.

# Hospital Acquired Pneumonia - On [**2149-12-21**], patient developed a
fever, hypoxia and an infiltrate was noted on CXR.  He was
started on empiric therapy for hospital acquired pneumonia of
vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime IV.  A 7 day course was
completed with an improvement in his breathing, and a reduction
in his oxygen requirement.  On the floor he was given standing
albuterol and Atrovent nebs, and was had regular chest PT with
respiratory therapy with a significant improvement in function.


# Tachycardia - Patient had tachycardia, alternating between
sinus tachycardia and multifocal atrial tachycardia in the range
of 110-140 early in his SICU course.  Cardiology was consulted
and recommended up titration of his metoprolol. His metoprolol
was gradually up titrated to 200mg PO tid.  As his clinical
picture improved, this dose was gradually reduced to 50mg PO
bid, with rates in the 80s-90s on discharge.

# Nutrition - Initial speech and swallow evaluation found that
it was unsafe for him to take anything PO due to aspiration
risk. A Dobbhoff feeding tube was placed for nutrition and given
tube feeds.  He pulled the feeding tube once, and it needed to
be replaced.  Repeat speech/swallow evaluation with video
swallow found him to be safe to eat pureed solids with nectar
thickened liquids.  Feeding tube was removed and he was started
on the recommended diet on discharge.
