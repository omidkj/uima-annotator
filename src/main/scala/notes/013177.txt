Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Left hip pain.

Cardiac catheterization.


History of Present Illness:
73 year-old male with history of CAD, HTN, CHB with PPM, PAF on
coumadin who suffered a fall forward "onto all fours" per wife
in Bahamas on [**Name (NI) 2974**]. He did not have any head trauma. The
patient complained of left hip pain. The patient was med
flighted to [**Location (un) 71836**], where he was diagnosed with a proximal femur
fracture, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On arrival in the ED, noted
to be hemodynamically stable, but hematocrit was 21.9 (unknown
baseline). INR was 1.3; he had last taken warfarin the day
preceding his fall.
.
The patient's wife states that at baseline he walks on level
surfaces without difficulty, but she has noted he is having
increasing SOB. When asked if she thought he could climb two
flights of stairs with a bag of groceries, she says that he
would have to stop and rest for shortness of breath.
.
The patient states he has anginal pain when he gets aggrevated,
and has been needing to use his nitrostat more frequently of
late.
.
Review of systems otherwise negative in detail.

Past Medical History:
1. Pacer placed post-MI for complete heart block, replaced x2
most recently [**2-/2188**]
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, on coumadin
3. Hypertension
4. Early Alzheimer's dementia
5. Depression/anxiety
6. Left femoral fracture
7. ? Hodgkin's Lymphoma
8. ? TIA

Social History:
Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 3844**]. Rare alcohol use; history of
tobacco use, but quit a number of years ago.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Pertinent Results:
FEMUR /KNEE/HIP LEFT  [**2189-3-29**]
IMPRESSION: Oblique fracture of the proximal left femur
involving the lesser trochanter and proximal femoral diaphysis.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-3-29**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Tiny bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
2. Bilateral renal lesions, the larger are consistent with
cysts, several subcentimeter lesions are too small to
characterize. There is a 1.6-cm high- density lesion at the
upper pole of the left kidney, which is not completely
characterized. Further evaluation with ultrasound or MRI is
recommended. Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic cyst or
renal cell carcinoma.
3. Suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
4. Left femoral fracture extending from the femoral neck down to
the proximal femur, this fracture is significantly displaced and
there is a large left thigh hematoma involving nearly the entire
rectus femoris muscle. There is also a left knee joint effusion.

.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2189-3-31**]
Conclusions:
Technically suboptimal study.
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the
basal half of the inferolateral wall and hypokineis of the
distal half of the septum and anterior wall and apex. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is not well seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve is not well seen. No definite mitral
regurgitation is identified. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD.
.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2189-4-3**]
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 30% to 40% (nl >=55%)
The left atrium is elongated.  Left ventricle is mildly
hypertrophied.. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. There is Akinesis of the basal and mid
posterior wall. There is hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall.
There is hypokisis of the distal antieror and septal walls and
the apex. Overall, the function and wall motion does not appear
appreciably changed from the previous (limited) transthoracic
study of [**2189-3-31**]. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened.  There is mild aortic valve stenosis
(area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation or stenosis is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Findings relayed to surgical team at
bedside at the time of the exam.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2189-4-4**]
No pulmonary embolism. Small bilateral pleural effusions with
associated dependent bibasilar lung atelectasis. Nonspecific
patchy ground glass attenuation throughout both lungs, which is
worse in the right upper lobe.  Findings may represent early
infection or pulmonary edema. Wedge fracture of a single mid
thoracic vertebral body.
.
Tranesophagel echocardiogram [**2189-4-4**]
Conclusions:
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-3-31**],
the right
ventricular function is similar. Please see prior echocardiogram
for full
study. This was a limited examination.

BRIEF HISTORY:   73 year old male with coronary artery disease
status
post two remote myocardial infarction who presented with a hip
fracture
and NSTEMI.  Echocardiogram revealed an LVEF of 35% with wall
motion
abnormalities consistent with rPDA and mid-LAD disease.
Catheterization
deferred prior to hip surgery but now referred to the cath lab
prior to
resuming physical rehabilitation.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease

PROCEDURE:
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French angled pigtail catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.

Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
