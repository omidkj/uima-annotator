Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
colonscopy
upper endoscopy
Femoral line [**2106-1-8**]

History of Present Illness:
83 yo F with h/o CHF (EF 60% s/p 2 prior admissions for CHF
exacerbation in the last 2 months, medically managed), HTN, CAD,
and hyperlipidemia presents with acute SOB.  She was in her
usual state of health until the day of admission when she
developed acute shortness of breath during the night.  She was
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she was found to be acutely
dyspneic and tachypneic, she denied any CP.  O2 sats in the 40's
on RA and 80's on a NRB mask.  She was intubated for resp
distress and started on propofol.  She was hypertensive, with
SBP's in the 200's.  She was started on a Nitro drip with
improvement in her SBP's to the 120's.
.
CXR in the ED was consistent with pulmonary edema.  Initial EKG
with hyperacute peaked T waves in the setting of a K of 6.0.
She received insulin, D5, calcium gluconate, and lasix.
.
A repeat EKG in the ED showed worsening hyperacute T waves
worrisome for ischemia.  She was given an aspirin and started on
a heparin drip prior to transfer to the CCU.
.
Pt received vanco, levo, and flagyl for a leukocytosis (WBC
34.8) and question of PNA.  Femoral line was placed emergently.

[**2106-1-8**] CT head:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No prior for comparison. Prominence of
sulci and ventricles is likely related to patient's age. No
shift of normally midline structures, hemorrhage, or infarction
are identified. Hypodensities in both corona radiata and centra
semiovale as well as calcifications in both basal ganglia
indicate chronic microvascular change. Cavernous carotid
arteries are calcified. Soft tissue density is seen in the left
external auditory canal, likely cerumen. Layering fluid in the
nasopharynx. The patient is intubated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
EKG [**2106-1-8**]:
79 bpm, Sinus rhythm. Rare atrial premature beat. Left atrial
abnormality. There are QS deflections in leads VI-V2. ST segment
elevations with tall symmetric peaked T waves in lead V3.
Symmetric peaked T waves are also present in leads V4-V5. Rule
out acute anterior myocardial infarction and hyperkalemia.
.
CT Chest [**2106-1-10**]:
1. Dense calcifications of the aortic valve and annulus, less
extensive distally, detailed above.
2. Moderately large, layering, nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions,
right slightly greater than left, producing relaxation
atelectasis.
3. Thyroid nodules unchanged or slightly smaller than on
[**2105-11-15**].
.

Carotid US [**2106-1-12**]:
IMPRESSION: 60 to 69% right ICA stenosis. Less than 40% left ICA
stenosis.
.
Cardiac cath [**2106-1-13**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Known severe AS.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
83-yo woman with h/o poorly controlled CHF, severe AS, HTN, CAD,
admitted with acute pulmonary edema in the setting of severe AS
and hypertensive crisis.  She was initially intubated for
hypoxia and tolerated extubation.  She was evaluated for AVR but
given the risks of the surgery, the family and patient have
declined.
.
#  Respiratory distress: The patient initially presented with
hypoxia in the setting of acute pulmonary edema from
hypertensive crisis and severe AS (consistent with prior
episodes).  She was intubated and post diuresis and BP control,
tolerated extubation.  She also received nebulizers for COPD.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.  She has had similar
hospitalizations in the past and was evaluated for possible AVR
to prevent similar episodes although ultimately, the family
declined.
.
# Coronaries: A cardiac catheterization was performed in order
to evaluate coronary arteries as part of the evaluation for AVR.
 Cardiac cath revealed three vessel disease.  She continued
medical management including ASA 325, BB, statin, ACEi.
.
# Rhythm: During her hospital course, she was in NSR and at
times in atrial tachycardia.  Her beta-blocker was titrated up.

.
# Valves: She has severe AS with valve area 0.7cm^2; She also
has 2+ MR and 2+ TR on TTE.  Given several hospitalizations for
dypnea, severe AS was considered a possible cause of her
presentation.  The patient and family was initially interested
in considering aortic valve repair surgery.  She was worked up
for possible AVR including carotid doppler which showed
60-69%stenosis and cardiac catheterization with 3 vessel
disease.  After discussion with cardiothoracic surgery, the
family declined surgical intervention given the risks of
surgery.
.
# Guaiac positive stool/Hct drop. Her HCT (34-->27) in the
setting of guaiac positive stools.  She responded to 1uPRB.  A
colonoscopy was negative and upper endoscopy showed angioectasia
and gastritis.  She was continued on a PPI and started on
sucralfate.
.
# Change in MS:  During the course of the hospitalization, the
patient developed waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status changes.  She
was evaluated for infectious etiology including negative urine
and blood cultures (although she was afebrile and no WBC).
Although her CXR had showed evidence of atelectasis vs PNA, she
had no fever, normal WBC, no cough and CT chest was more
consistent with atelectasis rather than PNA.  She was continued
on incentive spirometry and no antibiotics.  Her mental status
improved to baseline by the time of discharge.

#  CKD: Creatinine at baseline.
