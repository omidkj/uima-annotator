Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 71 y/o male with ESRD, COPD, CML who presented with
dyspnea, relieved with hemodialysis secondary to volume
overload.

Dyspnea -  Given that there was a rapid improvement after large
volume dialysis as well as no signs of COPD exacerbation, his
dyspnea was likely caused only by fluid overload. He rapidly
Improved significantly with hemodialysis in which 5 kilos were
removed on [**2171-5-27**].  He was continued on his outpatient COPD
medication: tiotropium, advair, albuterol nebs prn. No IV
steroids were given.

Leukocytosis - appears to be at patient's baseline and likely
seconary to CMML as documented previously. In the absence of
fever or any other localizing symptoms, did not culture. CIS.

ESRD - HD MWF s/p HD yesterday. He was dialyzed two consecutive
days and had an excess of [**4-21**] L removed.  He was again
counselled on the necessity of adherance to a low salt diet.
Addtionally, a nutrition consultant spoke with the patient and
daughter (caretaker).

COPD - continue spiriva, adavir, and albuterol; no need for
systemic steroids

CMML - Diagnosed 6 months ago, and the patient is not being
treated at this time. Persistently elevated WBC count likely due

to CMML. Already being followed by oncology ([**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6944**])
