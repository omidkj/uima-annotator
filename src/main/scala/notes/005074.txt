Admission Date:  [**2180-12-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2181-1-3**]


Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year old
gentleman with a history of rheumatic heart disease and known
severe mitral stenosis with chronic atrial fibrillation,
previously determined left ventricular ejection fraction of
50%.

The patient presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
with four to five days of worsening dyspnea on exertion.  The
patient states that he is experiencing extreme dyspnea with
minimal exertion.  The patient also complains of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was found to be in
congestive heart failure, and was treated with intravenous
Lasix.  The patient was admitted to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for evaluation and treatment of his severe
mitral stenosis and congestive heart failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  History of seizure disorder.  2.
History of rheumatic fever with rheumatic heart disease.  3.
Status post squamous cell carcinoma of the neck.  4.  History
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  5.  History of
chronic atrial fibrillation since [**2176**] with multiple failed
cardioversions.  6.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of 1.5 to 1.8.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.a.m. and 60 mg
p.o.q.p.m., trandolapril 4 mg p.o.q.d., verapamil 240 mg
p.o.q.d., digoxin 0.1 mg p.o.q.d., Fosamax 30 mg p.o.q. week,
Tums one p.o.t.i.d., and Flonase one spray right nostril q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoker, quit 20
years ago, and uses alcohol rarely.  The patient lives alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the patient had a pulse of 90, atrial fibrillation, blood
pressure 122/69, respiratory rate 21 and oxygen saturation
95% on one liter nasal cannula.  General:  Patient noted to
be short of breath with conversation, however, he was in no
acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact,
moist mucous membranes, oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Positive 13
cm jugular venous distention, carotids without bruit.  Chest:
Crackles one-third of the way up bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly irregular with a II/VI diastolic
murmur, loudest at left lower sternal border with a right
ventricular heave.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly, positive
hepatojugular reflux.  Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis,
1+ nonpitting edema, positive right groin bruit.  Neurologic
examination:  Alert and oriented times three, cranial nerves
II through XII grossly intact, sensation intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 7.1, hematocrit
41.3, platelet count 183,000, prothrombin time 19.5, partial
thromboplastin time 36.2, INR 2.6, sodium 140, potassium 4.6,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 29, BUN 32, creatinine 1.8, blood
sugar 193, and digoxin level less than 0.3.  Chest x-ray
showed bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, no
congestive heart failure.  Electrocardiogram showed low
voltage in limb leads, atrial fibrillation, no ST-T wave
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the cardiology
service.  He was given vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma to
decrease his INR as well as Lasix to treat his congestive
heart failure.

On [**2180-12-27**], the patient underwent a transthoracic
echocardiogram to evaluate his valvular disease.  This showed
a moderately dilated left ventricle with overall normal left
ventricular systolic function, 1+ aortic regurgitation,
moderate mitral stenosis with 2+ mitral regurgitation,
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, normal pulmonary
artery pressures, no pericardial effusion.

The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory on that same day.  Catheterization revealed no
significant coronary artery disease, elevated left
ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 18, pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 24, mitral valve area 1.2 cm2, mean mitral
gradient 11 mm of mercury, and left ventricular ejection
fraction of 45%.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2180-12-29**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a mitral valve replacement with a
#29 St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical valve.  The patient was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit on a dobutamine infusion in stable
condition.

Transesophageal echocardiogram was performed in the Operating
Room, which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of
50%, mild global right ventricular systolic dysfunction,
moderate tricuspid regurgitation, trace mitral regurgitation
which is considered normal for the prosthesis.  Please see
the operative note for further details.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had rapid atrial
fibrillation and was started on amiodarone for rate control.
The patient required a Neo-Synephrine infusion to maintain
adequate blood pressure.  Dobutamine was weaned off, with
adequate cardiac index.  The patient was weaned the next day
from mechanical ventilation on his first postoperative night.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was started on
Coumadin for anticoagulation of his mitral valve.  The
Neo-Synephrine drip was weaned to off.  The patient was
started on Lopressor.  The patient's hematocrit in the
Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day number one was found
to be 23 and no treatment was given at that time as the
patient was hemodynamically stable.

The patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on
postoperative day number two.  On postoperative day number
three, the patient was started on a heparin infusion, as he
was still subtherapeutic for anticoagulation of his mitral
valve.  The patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation
with a controlled ventricular response.

The patient's pacing wires were removed on postoperative day
number three.  The patient began ambulating with the aid of
physical therapy.  On postoperative day number four, it was
noted that the patient's creatinine was elevated to 1.9.  His
hematocrit was 23.9.  It was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
the decision was made to transfuse one unit of packed red
blood cells.

The patient continued on a heparin infusion for
anticoagulation because his prothrombin time and INR were
subtherapeutic on his Coumadin dosing.  The patient was
cleared for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on
postoperative day number five.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's maximum temperature is
97.6, pulse 99, atrial fibrillation, blood pressure 98/50,
respiratory rate 14 and oxygen saturation 94% on two liters
nasal cannula.  The patient is awake, alert and oriented
times three without complaints.  Cardiovascular:  Irregularly
irregular without rub or murmur, sharp valve click.
Pulmonary:  Breath sounds clear bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  The patient
is tolerating a regular diet.  His sternal incision is intact
with staples, there is no erythema or drainage.  The sternum
is stable, without click.  Laboratory data are pending.
