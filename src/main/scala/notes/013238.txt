History of Present Illness:
76 F with recent med admit for E coli/Proteus UTI (R Levo) and
also Bilateral pneumonia --> d/c'ed on Meropenem to [**Hospital 4382**]-- who now presents with fever, tachypnea, and
hypotension. In the ED she was found to have a lactate of 6 and
a leukocytosis. A right IJ sepsis catheter was placed and she
was given 1.5 liters of saline (CVP ? [**2-3**]) and
levofloxacin/flagyl/Vancomycin. She was also given a total of
10x2 Units of Regular insulin for hyperglycemia.
.
She is a poor historian and cannot provide too much more
information. She does state that her breathing feels a little
more difficult and she denies chets and abdominal pain.

ECG:
.
CXR: New right lower lobe opacities, consistent with atelectasis

versus pneumonia. Interval improvement of left-sided pneumonia.

.
CXR: Right-sided central line with tip overlying right atrium.
No
evidence of pneumothorax. Right lower lobe opacity again seen
concerning for pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Sepsis:  In MICU, pt received ceftriaxone, meropenem, and
vancomycin.  Placed on sepsis protocol.  She was net positive
about 1.5L and continued on broad spec abx.  Her WBC came down
and she defervesced.  Her BP also improved and she never
required pressors.  No clear source is identified yet.
Possibilities include aspiration pneumonia (opacity on CXR),
UTI/pyelo, line infection (from PICC), decub ulcer.  However, pt
has improved with broad spectrum antibiotics.  Continued
meropenem, vancomycin as all cultures NTD.  Ceftriaxone
discontinued as it provides redundant coverage and causes
additional toxicity.  Repeated urine culture (1st one
contaminated) negative, decub wound culture: polymicorbial,
possible source cannot be excluded. Meropenem and Vancomycin
should be continued for a total 10 day course.
.
2) Hyperglycemia - Secondary to infection.  Her blood glucose
levels were difficult to manage with several readings in 400s.
She was started on NPH and titrated up with an additional tight
insulin sliding scale which resulted in improved glucose
control.  Metformin was restarted as the patient started to eat.

.
3) Acute renal failure - Likely due to volume depletion due to
sepsis and decreased renal perfusion. Improved with
hydration/treatment of sepsis.
.
4) FEN - NPO initially due to aspiration risk.  Speech and
swallow was asked to evaluate.  They recommended
Diabetic/Consistent Carbohydrate Consistency: Pureed; Honey
prethickened liquids.
