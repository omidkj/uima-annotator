BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] is a 75-year-old Caucasian
male with a prior medical history significant for Clostridium
difficile colitis.  He is status post colectomy and ileostomy
at the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Last Name (un) 4068**] on [**2156-6-5**].  He subsequently had a small
bowel obstruction with a white blood cell count of 22,000.  A
CT scan at that time showed a clear transition point after
two days of conservative therapy.  He was taken to the
Operating Room at that time for an exploratory
laparotomy/lysis of adhesions, placement of a G tube, repair
of enterostomy.  The postoperative course was not noted to be
unusual.  However, on or about postoperative day number 12,
the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with a
hypotension and positive cardiac enzymes.  At that time, it
was noted that the patient had evolved into a septic picture,
precipitating an MI or the reverse.

Records from that time showed that the patient went into
atrial fibrillation, although there was a prior history of
atrial fibrillation.  He subsequently ruled in for a
myocardial infarction.  Full workup at that time including a
CT scan and reciting of his central line did not show any
clear sources for his septic picture.  Subsequent cultures
did become positive for MRSA pneumonia.  On [**2156-6-19**], the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

LABORATORY RESULTS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count
21.6, hematocrit 29.6, platelets 730,000.  Sodium 139,
potassium 2.0, chloride 108, C02 12, BUN 40, creatinine 1.2,
glucose 104.  CK MB was found to be 90, troponin 12, and then
ultimately 8.7.

RADIOLOGY:  CT scan on [**2156-6-5**] showed evidence of a hiatal
hernia and bilateral effusions.  However, there was no small
bowel obstruction; however, no other possible sources for
infection.

On [**2156-6-15**], a CT scan of the head was performed.  This was
negative.

On [**2156-6-18**], another CT scan showed a large left chest
pleural effusion; however, this was not thought to be
tappable.

EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Upon this presentation to the
[**Hospital1 18**] Intensive Care Unit, the temperature was 98.9, pulse
83, blood pressure 118/62, respirations 30, saturating 100
percent on room air.  He was at that time intubated and on a
ventilator with an SIMV setting of 500 cc tidal volume, rate
24.  In general, the patient is described as sedated and
intubated.  Examination showed the pupils to be equal and
reactive bilaterally.  The sclerae were nonicteric.  The
lungs had clear sounds in the apices; however, decreased
breath sounds at the bases.  The cardiac examination revealed
a regular rate and rhythm.  No evidence of any murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, with a healing
midline incision. The ileostomy was pink, healthy appearing,
with an appliance placed.  Lower extremities were somewhat
edematous but otherwise unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Soon after his arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], the
patient had a Thoracic Surgery consult.  Based on the
recommendations of these, it was felt that the patient's
findings were consistent with a known pneumonia and a
loculated left pleural effusion.  Long-term, it was felt that
the patient would likely need that but might consider chest
tube placement in the interim.  This plan was acknowledged by
the primary team; however, no chest tubes were placed at that
time.  The patient was maintained on empiric treatment with
vancomycin and Zosyn for a known MRSA infection and
presumption of a possible other infection source.

On hospital day number two, after further evaluation of the
radiographic findings, the attending thoracic surgeon felt
that what had been presumed to be a left collection in the
chest rather than being an empyema or other collection was
most likely a hiatal hernia.  Nevertheless, there was
recognized the presence of the two rather smaller pleural
effusions.  The Cardiology workup consult recommended that
the patient be continued on Lopressor and be anticoagulated
when possible.

With regards to the positive cardiac enzymes, their feeling
was that this was most likely a demand ischemia and not
associated with a plaque rupture.  Recommendations were to
continue aspirin and a beta blocker and possibly after the
patient recovers from the acute phase of his illness can
consider an ischemic workup as an outpatient with a P MIBI
versus a possible catheterization.

On hospital day number two through three, the patient
gradually stabilized.  Starting on hospital day number three,
his ventilator was gradually weaned and on the evening of
hospital day number three he was ultimately weaned from the
ventilator.  On hospital day number four, he was started on
tube feeds and these were gradually increased until goal was
met.

Attention then turned to the treatment of the patient's
atrial fibrillation.  He was started on heparin for
anticoagulation.  Per Cardiology recommendations, he was
started on Amiodarone 200 mg q.d. on [**2156-6-22**].  The plan was
after one week of b.i.d. dosing the patient could be switched
to 200 mg p.o. q.d.  Lopressor was continued.  The patient
was maintained on anticoagulation with heparin to a goal PTT
of 60-80.

On [**2156-6-21**], the patient underwent a cardiac echocardiogram
to assess any changes in his cardiac function.  This showed
that the left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function were normal with an LV ejection fraction of
greater than 55 percent.  The only notable change was a
moderate to severe 3+ mitral regurgitation.  The patient was
started on Enalapril which could be titrated upwards as
tolerated for the mitral regurgitation.

On [**2156-6-23**], it became increasingly clear that the patient
had some residual neurological deficits.  While his
examination was never focal and there could not be any
specific deficits found, he remained unresponsive and
persistently confused.  A Neurology consult was sought and
thorough workup including all relevant blood tests were sent.
These were all shown to be negative.  The patient went on to
have an MR scan which other than some nonspecific atrophy and
old lacunar infarcts did not show any specific etiologies
that would explain his change in mental status.  The
diagnosis of exclusion of post Intensive Care Unit psychosis
was assigned with the hope that the patient's mental status
would gradually improved as he spent more time outside the
Intensive Care Unit.

Indeed, over the next 72 hours, as the patient's day and
night schedule has continued to normalize, he has become more
alert and oriented and is now conversant with some effort.

On [**2156-6-27**], there became increasing concern about the
patient's ostomy output which was reaching as high as 2
liters per day.  He was subsequently bolused with an
appropriate amount of IV fluids to maintain his fluid
balance.  A small amount of tincture of morphine was also
added to his tube feeds.  This subsequently resolved over the
next 48-72 hours.

On [**2156-6-29**], there was again concern that there might be an
underlying infection or fluid collection which might explain
the slow return to mental function.  Plans were made for an
ultrasound-guided pleurocentesis.  Following informed consent
provided by the patient's wife, he was evaluated for this.
After several views with the attending radiologist, it was
felt that none of the collections were substantial enough for
a tap.  The patient was subsequently returned to his room.
