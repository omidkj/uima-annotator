Pertinent Results:
[**2190-3-18**] Echo: Pre-pericardial stripping: A patent foramen ovale
is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is a moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is no evidence of pericardial constriction (abnormal
septal motion, LV inflow pattern abnormalities), however tissue
Doppler and Vp suggest (borderline) abnormal diastolic function.
Post effusion drainage/pericardial stripping showed a change of
E:A ratios from near 2:1 toward 1:1. No other changes were
observed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 45736**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**3-18**] she was brought directly to
the Operating Room where she underwent pericardial stripping.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from
sedation and extubated.

She does have a psychiatric history including [**Hospital1 **]-polar disease.
She experienced post-operative delerium.  Narcotics and
benzodiazepines were minimized.  Psychiatry was consulted and
her mental status cleared. Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward her preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.

The patient was noted to have a lower extremity tremor.
Neurology was consulted.  The tremor did resolve prior to
discharge.  Neurology recommended an MRI for evaluation,
however, the patient was unable to tolerate this.  It will be
scheduled as an outpatient, and the patient will follow up with
neurology following discharge.

Chest tubes were discontinued without complication.  The patient
was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on [**3-24**]
the  patient was ambulating without assistance, the wound was
healing [**Last Name (un) 35099**] pain was controlled with oral analgesics.

Rheumatology was consulted for evaluation of a possible auto
immine etiology of the pericarditits and [**Doctor First Name **] an drheumatoid
factor assays were sent.  Arrangements were made for outpatient
follow up with them at the time of her return surgical visit.
The patient was discharged to home in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
