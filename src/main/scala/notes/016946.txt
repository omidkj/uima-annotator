Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 45 yo with end stage pulmonary disease secondary to
emphysema and asthma here with COPD exacerbation and prolonged
respiratory failure.
*
1) Respiratory Failure: secondary to COPD exacerbation with poor
FEV1(0.23) at baseline from PFTs [**1-17**] and was on transplant
list but taken off for continued smoking.  Unclear trigger of
exacerbating event, but on arrival was febrile to 101.  Started
on and completed 7 day course of levoquin for suspected
pneumonia/bronchitis. Her DFA for influenza was negative and
sputum was minimal with sputum cultures growing only
oropharyngeal flora.  She was intubated [**2150-4-10**] for increased
respiratory distress and remained on ventilator with slow wean
despite steroids and bronchodilators. Initially was difficult to
ventilate without excessive sedating meds, of note on last
prolonged respiratory failure last year- she had required
paralytics. CTA [**4-13**] (-) for PE. Given prolonged ventilator
wean,  patient had trach and PEG placed by CT surgery [**2150-4-17**].
Current respiratory status improving and tolerating pressure
support.
.
2) Steroid myopathy: after weaning of sedation, patient
initially noted to be weak.  She had C-spine imaged and
neurology consult.  Her C-spine was negative for epidural
abscess, but noted to have a T-5 fracture- that is assymptomatic
and will just be followed. Neurology was consulted and the
patient had an EMG [**4-27**] that was consistent with axonal
polyneuropathy. Given brisk LE reflexes, she underwent a thoraic
and lumbar MRI [**2150-4-28**], results pending at time of dictation.
.
3) Sinusitis: after 2weeks into her stay after intubation,
patient developed fevers and had a positive head CT for
sinusitis and was treated empirically with 10 days of Vancomycin
and ceftaz; she will complete her course on [**2150-5-2**]. At time of
discharge, she remained afebrile with wbc 12.5 (trending down).
*
4) Fluid overload: Following admission, the patient was
aggressively hydrated given low urine output with good response.
Over the course of her stay, however, she was noted to have a
positive fluid balance with increased lower extremity edema. She
was treated with IV furosemide with good results and was
transitioned over to PO lasix for a goal I/O (-) 500 cc/day. Her
volume state (including daily weights) will need to be monitored
following discharge and her furosemide dose adjusted as needed
for clinical euvolemia.
*
5) Esophageal candidiasis: During PEG placement on [**2150-4-17**], she
was noted to have evidence of esophageal candidiasis and was
treated with a 7 day course of fluconazole.
*
6) Cephalic vein clot: On [**2150-4-15**], the patient was noted to have
increased right upper extremeity edema. A right upper extremity
ultrasound confirmed an occlusive thrombus in the right cephalic
vein. She completed a 7 day course of heparin for a superficial
clot.
*
7) HTN: The patient blood pressure was initially elevated,
however it improved with appropriate pain/anxiety management.
She was discharged on her home dose of captopril.
*
8) Anxiety: The patient's chronic anxiety was a major management
issue during this hospitalization. Following intubation, she was
initially sedated with propofol, however was transitioned to
Fenanyl/Versed with better results. She was continued on home
doses of Seroquel, and neurontin. Klonopin was added to her
regimen along with prn Ativan. She had multiple episodes of
severe anxiety with associated tachypnea (respiratory rate in
the 30s) and tachycardia (HR 120s-140s) requiring IV
ativan/haldol. Effexor was restarted on [**2150-4-27**] once she was
able to take oral  medications (using Passy Muir valve).
*
9) Ileus: secondary to excessive narcotics regemin and resolved
with aggressive bowel regemin.
*
10) FEN: Passed swallow evaluation on [**4-27**] who recommended
advancing pt to PO diet as tolerated (thin liquids and soft
solids) with PMV in place. Medications whole with water as
tolerated (or via PEG). At time of discharge, the patient's oral
intake is limited by tachypnea. She continues to receive tube
feeds via PEG tube and is only receiving Effexor by mouth.
