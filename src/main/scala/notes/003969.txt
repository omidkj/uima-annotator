History of Present Illness:
The patient OPCABG x 4 on [**2171-7-29**].  Post-op course was lengthy
and complicated.  He initially was hemodynamically unstable,
requiring vasopressor support.  EP saw the patient for
ventricular ectopy.  PPM/AICD was not recommended.  He continued
to be bradycardic, and would receive a temporary pacer.  This
was removed, EP did not feel a PPM was indicated.
He developed a sternal wound infection and was taken to the
operating room by plastic and reconstructive surgery for sternal
plating and bilateral pectoralis flaps.  The patient required
re-intubation several times during the [**Hospital **] hospital course,
and eventually received a trach and PEG on [**2171-8-30**]. EVH site was
debrided, and he received a 10 day course of vancomycin.  He was
transferred to rehab on POD 45, [**2171-9-12**].  He returned on [**2171-9-13**]
with fever and hypotension.   During this hospitalization he was
found to have CDiff in the stool and was placed on appropriate
antibiotics.
His hypotension resolved

Pertinent Results:
GJ TUBE CHECK.
One view of the abdomen. There is motion artifact. Contrast
material has
been injected via a gastrostomy tube. Contrast has accumulated
in a small
area in the left upper quadrant, presumably within the gastric
lumen. The
bowel gas pattern is not remarkable. There are degenerative
changes in the
lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Limited study demonstrating findings consistent with
placement of the gastrostomy tube in the stomach. See procedure
note.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for workup and management of fever and
hypotension.  He was empirically treated with vancomycin and
zosyn.  There was question of malposition of G-tube on CT scan,
so urgent EGD was performed.  Tube was re-positioned without
complication.  Contrast study was negative for extravasation.
Tube feeds were resumed.  Wound care was consulted for
evaluation of [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85030**] pressure ulcer (present prior to
admission).
Pan cultured for fever workup, sputum culture would grow gram
negative rods and stool was positive for c-diff.  The patient
was treated with flagyl and zosyn. After several days on Flagyl
the patient continue to have watery stool and PO Vancomycin was
added for treatment of CDiff infection.

Pulmonary status remains tenuous, attempts to wean ventilator to
pressure support ventilation with 5 Peep and 5 Pressure support
were unsucessful. The patient would quickly have an episode of
tachypnea requiring increased pressure support. Interventional
pulmonary was consulted, an ultrasound of pleural space showed
small loculated effusion that was not amendable to drainage.

On hospital day 10 the patient was transferred to rehabilitation
at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 8**].
