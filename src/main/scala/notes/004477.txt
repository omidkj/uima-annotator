Service:  CME


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old gentleman
with past medical history significant for hypertension, GERD,
COPD, long tobacco history who initially presented to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2193-5-15**] with chief complaint of left
jaw and arm pain.  The patient was seen in the ER, but left
due to lack of bed availability.  Apparently, the patient was
pain free over the next few days, but on [**2193-5-18**], he
developed similar left arm and jaw pain.  He represented to
the Emergency Room.  He was given sublingual nitroglycerin
and morphine.  An EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 39, normal
axis, PR prolongation, Q wave in I, aVL, V4-V6, T-wave
inversions in II, III, aVF, and scoopy ST segments in V5-V6.
His creatinine kinases were flat, but his troponin was 2.3.
The patient was started on Norvasc and Imdur, his beta-
blocker was held.  The patient was transferred to the CMI
Service for cardiac catheterization.  The patient had a
complicated cardiac catheterization with ST elevations in V1-
V3, hypertension, bradycardia and was transferred to the CCU
for closer monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

GERD.

COPD.

Status post appendectomy.

Right eye surgery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AS AN OUTPATIENT:
1. Aspirin.
2. Lopressor.



MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Imdur 30 mg every day.
2. Aspirin 325 mg every day.
3. Norvasc 5 mg every day.
4. Lopressor 25 mg 2 times a day.


FAMILY HISTORY:  No CAD, dyslipidemia or diabetes mellitus.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Two packs per day of tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is afebrile.  Heart rate 79, up
from the low of 39; blood pressure 171/68, oxygen saturation
95-100 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general, he is
lying in bed in no apparent distress.  HEENT:  Extraocular
muscles intact.  His neck is supple.  The patient is lying
completely flat without elevated JVP.  Chest clear to
auscultation in anterior lung fields.  Cardiovascular,
regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen soft, normoactive bowel sounds, audible bruit.
Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Bilateral
femoral bruits right greater than left starting at the level
of umbilicus.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit 33.9.  His cardiac
catheterization on [**2193-5-20**] showed severe LAD and RCA
disease, moderate left circumflex and diagonal disease.  He
had successful PTCA and stenting of the RCA with a 2.5 mm
Taxus stent.  Specifically, his LMCA was not obstructed.  His
LAD showed long severe diffuse disease, apical LAD filled by
collaterals from the OMB.  His diagonal was proximally
occluded 70 percent in the large branching vessel.  Left
circumflex was not obstructed.  His OM-1 with 70 percent
diffuse mid-stenosis and RCA with 95 percent mid-vessel
stenosis in the large dominant vessel.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 75-year-old man with hypertension,
GERD, COPD, status post stent to RCA, LAD, diagonal with
cardiac catheterization complicated by episodes of jaw pain,
ST elevations, hypertension, and bradycardia was admitted to
CCU for closer observation.

Cardiac.  Ischemia:  He was continued on aspirin, Plavix,
Integrilin.  His CK and troponins were trended.  His troponin
was noted to go up to 0.24 the day after cardiac
catheterization.  His troponin actually continued to rise.
His troponin peaked at 0.79.  His CKs peaked at 373.  The
patient was started on low-dose beta-blockers, Lopressor 12.5
mg 2 times a day, which he tolerated without significant
bradycardia.  Over the next several days, his [**Last Name (un) **] was
restarted and was titrated up, and it was felt that the
creatinine kinase and troponin leak after his cardiac
catheterization was due to jailing of acute marginal branch
when the stent was placed in the RCA.

Pump:  The patient had a repeat echocardiogram, which showed
preserved ejection fraction of 60-70 percent.  He had no
evidence of congestive heart failure throughout the remainder
of his hospitalization.

Rhythm:  Initially, the patient was noted to have
hypertension and bradycardia, was concerning for vagal
episodes versus right coronary artery ischemia with decreased
blood flow to the SA node.  He was followed throughout the
remainder of his hospitalization, and his heart rate remained
between the high 40s and 60s even with the addition of the
beta-blocker.  It was felt that this may have been just a
vagal episode related to the cardiac catheterization.

COPD:  Given the recent event, the patient's beta-agonists
were held.  He was given ipratropium for wheezing as needed.

Neurologic:  The patient was noted to have altered mental
status, was described as agitated, disoriented, and
combative.  The patient had received opioids and possibly
benzodiazepines, given he had been written for these on as
needed basis.  In addition, he received atropine for his
bradycardia in the cardiac catheterization lab.  It was felt
that the atropine may be contributing to the delirium.  In
addition, it was felt that the patient may have some baseline
dementia, which was exacerbated by the ICU setting.  The
patient was started on Haldol, which was then changed to
olanzapine given the olanzapine has less anticholinergic
effects.  The patient was monitored continually by the
nursing staff, and his mental status slowly improved and was
significantly back to baseline prior to discharge.

Hypertension:  The patient's blood pressure was initially
quite elevated.  He was started on a nitroglycerin drip in
the Intensive Care Unit.  The nitroglycerin drip was slowly
titrated off, and he was started on hydrochlorothiazide.  His
Avapro was slowly increased.  He was continued on Lopressor
12.5 mg, which was started for his CAD.  In addition, the
patient's amlodipine was increased up to 10 mg every day, and
he was started on hydralazine 25 mg 3 times a day prior to
discharge.  The patient was to follow up with his
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] in 2 weeks for further titration of
his blood pressure.

Hematocrit:  The patient had blood count of 33.9 on admission
in the ICU.  His MCV was in the low 80s.  He had iron studies
sent, which showed a low B12, low ferritin, low iron but high
TIBC, which was consistent with a mixed picture of possibly
both iron deficiency and B12 deficiency anemia.  The
patient's B12 was repleted, and he was started on iron with
vitamin C to improve absorption.  He was guaiac negative
throughout this hospital stay, however, given his iron
deficiency anemia, we recommended an outpatient colonoscopy
on discharge.

Tobacco use:  The patient has a history of 2 packs per day.
He was started on nicotine patch and did well throughout the
hospital stay without craving.  We continued to encourage him
to try to quit smoking on discharge.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable, ambulating without difficulty,
alert, and oriented times 3.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease, status post
