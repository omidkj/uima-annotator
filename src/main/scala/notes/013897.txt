History of Present Illness:
History of present illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 55 yo woman with
metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, hypertension, h/o
DVT s/p IVC filter and recently discharged after having acute
shortness of breath thought [**1-12**] atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED today with
acute-onset shortness of breath at about 6 p.m. on the day prior
to admission.
.
She denies fever, chills, sweats, cough, increased sputum
production.
.
Of note, two days prior to admission, the pt had a CT scan of
her torso that revealed progression of her disease throughout,
including
interval progression in abnormal pulmonary densities involving
all lobes. They now have a more interstitial and consolidative
appearance, greatest in the lower lobes.

She received continuous nebs, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV,
furosemide 20 mg, levofloxacin and ceftriaxone. She was admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

Reports:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2181-12-1**] 11:49 PM
SINGLE AP UPRIGHT BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: As seen on CT of the
chest from one day prior, there are multiple large loculated
pleural effusions, which appear roughly stable compared to one
day prior. There are bibasilar fluffy opacities, right greater
than left, consistent with pneumonia as seen on CT from one day
prior. The pulmonary vasculature is engorged and there is
perihilar haziness and increased interstitial markings,
consistent with mild- to-moderate pulmonary edema. Right
subclavian catheter terminates at the SVC- cavoatrial junction.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with prominence of the
left hilum due to a component of loculated effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar opacities, consistent with pneumonia as seen on CT
from one day prior.
2. Mild-to-moderate interstitial edema.
3. Persistent large loculated pleural effusions.
.
Study Date of [**2181-12-1**]  11:45:12 PM
Sinus tachycardia. Peaked P waves with rightward P axis. Low
limb lead
voltage. Compared to the prior tracing of [**2181-11-22**] atrial ectopy
is no longer precorded. The rate has increased. Otherwise, no
diagnostic interim change
.
Study Date of [**2181-12-2**]  8:40:58 PM
Baseline artifacat. Sinus tachycardia. Rightward axis. Delayed R
wave
progression with late precordial QRS transition. Non-specific T
wave
abnormalities. Findings are non-specific but clinical
correlation is
suggested. Since previous tracing of [**2181-12-1**] no significant
change.
.
TTE [**2181-12-1**]
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There is a moderate sized
(partially echo filled anterior to the right ventricle;
echolucent anterior to the right atrium and inferior/lateral to
the left ventricle) pericardial effusion. No definite right
atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-11-16**],
the findings are similar (heart rate is slower).

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and MICU course:  This is a 55 y.o. female with
metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary first diagnosed in
[**2181-5-10**] from percardiocentesis fluid cytology, recent cycle of
capcitabine/irinotecan, history of PE/DVT s/P IVC filter and
enoxparin therapy, and SVT secondary to malignancy, who was
admitted from the ED to ICU for recurrent respiratory distress
and tachycardia. Despite diuretic therapy, antibiotic therapy,
nebulizer treatments, heart rate control, and corticosteroid
therapy, she did not improve substantially. Given this, along
with progression of disease on CT imaging in spite of receiving
chemotherapy, it was eventually determined by primary oncology
team and patient's family to pursue comfort measures only.
.
#) Dyspnea. Secondary to disease progression, pleural &
pericardial effusions.
She was continued nebulizers and Morphine elixir prn for
comfort.  Avoid morphine IV unless necessary, per patient
wishes.  Continue lorazepam for anxiety
.
# leaky foley, dysuria, and groin rash: She was briefly on
cipro, but it was discontinued as her UCx was negative.  She had
a significantly irritated urethra, likey from a reaction to the
original foley.  She was switched to a silicon foley and given
urojet, pyridium, and antibiotic ointment which resulted in mild
symptomatic improvement.  These measures should be continues.
She was given ditropan with minimal improvement and the caliber
of her foley was increased with no improvement.  The next step
may be removing the foley, but she has been resistent to this so
far both because of the dysuria and because of reluctance to
wear adult diapers.  In addition, she has what looks like an
incontinence rash in her groin, which should be treated with
barrier cream (mupirocin [**Hospital1 **]), sarna prn, and keeping her as dry
as possible.  She may need an antifungal if her rash begins to
look fungal.
.
#) Tachycardia. Secondary to malignancy, was on diltiazem for
heart rate control to help with dyspnea. Managed as per her
dyspnea as above.
.
#) Adenocarcinoma. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and patient and family,
goals of care addressed and patient is comfort measures only.
