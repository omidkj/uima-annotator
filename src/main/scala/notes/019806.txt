[**2122-7-15**] ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending aorta is
markedly dilated There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. There is a dissection flap that originates around the
right coronary and extends into the arch. The aortic arch is
moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There is intramural thrombus present in the
descending aorta. There is spontaneous echo contrast in the
descending thoracic aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. Mitral regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified.
7. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusions of nitroglycerine. Well-seated synthetic
graft in the aortic position from the sinotubular junction. No
apparent leak. There is residual intramural thromus at the level
of right coronary cusp. Coronary flow is visible in both the RCA
and LMCA. The descending aorta is unchanged post decannulation.
There is a small right pleural effusion. The pericardial
effusion is small..

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 78527**]
Reason: ischemic event/bleed



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   77 year old woman s/p emergent AAA
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   ischemic event/bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Provisional Findings Impression: RSRc MON [**2122-7-20**] 2:08 PM


Evolution of multiple subacute infarctions throughout right
frontal, parietal,
temporal, bilateral occipital, and cerebellar lobes. No
hemorrhage, mass
effect, or midline shift.


Final Report
HISTORY: 77-year-old female with emergent AAA repair several
days prior.
Please evaluate for ischemic event or hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: CTA head four days prior.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial imaging was performed from the
cranial vertex to
the foramen magnum without IV contrast.

HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Multifocal cortical and subcortical

hypodensities involving the frontal, parietal, and occipital
lobes as well as
the cerebellum bilaterally are more well defined, indicative of
evolving
ischemic infarction. There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect,
or shift of
normally midline structures. The visualized paranasal sinuses
are
unremarkable. The mastoid air cells are clear. Mild
periventricular
hypodensity is indicative of chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.

IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral hypodensities consistent with
evolving
subacute infarction.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

COMPARISON: [**2122-7-24**]..

FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Over the interval, the patient has
undergone
tracheostomy which is appropriately positioned. A right internal
jugular
central venous line has been removed and there is no
pneumothorax. The left-
sided PICC line tip resides within the proximal SVC. The
Dobbhoff tube has
been removed. There is a persistent left retrocardiac opacity
and small left-
sided pleural effusion. There is a small right-sided pleural
effusion as
well.
