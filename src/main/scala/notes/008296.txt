HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85 year-old male with
multiple medical problems including diabetes, congestive
heart failure with an EF of 25%, coronary artery disease with
known reversible ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and chronic renal failure who was sent from his
nursing home with mental status changes, leukocytosis and
increase in his creatinine and respiratory congestion.  The
patient had self discontinued his Foley three days prior to
admission.  He had been recently hospitalized from [**4-3**] to [**4-14**] for a congestive heart failure exacerbation and
acute renal failure requiring Natrecor and Dopamine.  He was
also found at that time to have reversible ischemia on a
PMIBI, but catheterization was deferred given his acute renal
failure.  In the Emergency Room on admission the patient was
found to have a systolic blood pressure of 79/31, which
initially improved to 129/31 with intravenous fluids, but
then fell.  His white blood cell count was found to be 28,
creatinine 3.5.  His urinalysis was suggestive of a urinary
tract infection.  He was entered into the sepsis protocol and
started on pressors.  The patient at that time was somnolent,
but denies any complaints.  Specifically he denied chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fevers or
chills.  He did not recall the events leading up to this
presentation in the Emergency Room, but he did recall that he
had been in his nursing home earlier that day.  He was unable
to provide any other history.  Per the family the patient had
been delirious for two to three days starting around the time
of pulling the Foley with poor appetite and no po intake for
the last two to three days.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He smoked 20 plus pack years.  Was unable to
get any other history at that time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission his temperature was 99.9.
His blood pressure was 79/31, which improved to 100/43 prior
to starting Dopamine.  His heart rate was 104 to 110.
Respiratory rate 30.  Sat 91% on room air.  In general, he
was a somnolent elderly man in no acute distress with mild
tachypnea.  HEENT his mucous membranes were dry.  Oropharynx
was clear.  He was anicteric.  Neck his JVP was about 10 cm,
supple, no lymphadenopathy.  Thorax course bilateral breath
sounds, diffuse expiratory wheezes.  Cardiovascular
tachycardiac.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities he had 2+ bilateral
lower extremity edema.  He had a 2+ sacral decube.
Neurological he was oriented to himself, [**Month (only) 958**] and [**2147**], but
not to the place.  He thought he was at the [**Hospital3 2576**].  He
moved all four extremities to command.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count was 28.7
with 87 neutrophils, 12 bands, hematocrit 29.6, platelets
351.  His chem 7 was within normal limits with the exception
of a BUN of 123 and a creatinine of 3.5.  His liver function
tests were within normal limits.  His lactate was 3.7.
Urinalysis moderate leukocyte esterase, nitrate positive, 11
to 20 white blood cells, many bacteria.  Electrocardiogram
was sinus tachycardia at 108.  QTC was 456.  There were no
acute ST or T wave changes.  Chest x-ray showed mild
cardiomegaly, mild congestive heart failure, left lower lobe
collapse versus consolidation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

1.  Sepsis:  The patient was initially started on Levaquin
given that they thought this was urosepsis.  One out of four
blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci.
Vancomycin was started.  The urine culture began growing out
coag positive staph aureus Methicillin sensitive.  The blood
cultures subsequently grew out Methicillin sensitive staph
aureus so the patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to
Oxacillin.  Vancomycin had been discontinued.  The patient
during his hospital course on [**4-19**] developed a pneumonia for
which he was started on Levaquin.  He completed a short
course of Levaquin.  The patient had a renal ultrasound done
to exclude an abscess in his kidneys and there was no
abscess.  He had an echocardiogram done on [**4-25**], which
showed no valvular abnormalities, however, there were 4 to 5
little regurgitant jets.  They could not see these coursing
through a perforation, but this could be suggestive of
endocarditis  so the patient will be continued on six weeks
of intravenous antibiotics.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient did have a troponin leak
likely secondary to demand ischemia.  He was continued on his
aspirin, Plavix, beta-blocker.  No ace secondary to his
creatinine and no statin secondary to his history of
myositis.

Myocardium:  Initially the patient when he was admitted to
the MICU was volume repleted, however, during hospital course
he developed worsening congestive heart failure so that the
patient was diuresed in the Intensive Care Unit on a Lasix
drip.  When he was discharged to the floor he was euvolemic.
The volume goal for him was to remain even.

3.  Pulmonary:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the
patient was continued on his regular inhaler regimen.

4.  Renal:  The patient had acute renal failure on admission,
which was worsened after the Lasix drip.  However, the
patient's creatinine has now improved to his baseline.

5.  Hematology:  Anemia, during his unit stay the patient did
develop some hematuria around the Foley site.  His hematocrit
drop to 24 to 25.  The patient was transfused 3 units of
packed red blood cells.  Stool guaiacs were negative.  The
patient's hematocrit remained stable after the 3 units of
blood in the Intensive Care Unit.  Coagulopathy, his INR was
slightly elevated on admission.  It was felt that this was
likely secondary to a nutritional deficiency.  The patient
was given three days of oral vitamin K and his INR
subsequently improved.

6.  Skin:  The patient had a grade 2 sacral decube.  He was
seen by plastic surgery who recommended wet to dry dressings
b.i.d.  On [**4-25**] the decube appeared to have a black
appearance to it.  Plastics was called.  They said that this
was the eschar formation of the decube and it was normal so
they recommended continuing Duoderm or Adaptic dressing
b.i.d. and keeping the area clean.

7.  Electrolytes:  The patient had persistent hypocalcemia
during his hospital stay, which was repleted.

8.  The patient had complained of leg pain during his
hospital course.  There was no localizing signs or symptoms.
It was felt that this could likely be a neuropathic pain.
The patient was started on Neurontin 100 mg po q.h.s.  This
will be followed by his outpatient primary care physician.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to the [**Hospital 24979**]
[**Hospital **] Nursing Home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Take all medications as prescribed.
Intravenous an
