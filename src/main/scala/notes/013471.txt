Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
chest and rib pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization [**2184-7-30**] s/p stent to LAD


History of Present Illness:
57 y/o man with h/o HTN presented to [**Hospital 882**] Hosp saying "I
think I may be having a heart attack."  The pt notes incr
belching, indigestion the past 2 days, with worsening
right-sided rib/chest pain and new substernal "rib pain" on deep
inspiration (pt is s/p rib fx from fall on [**Location (un) **] railing 3
weeks ago).  He took some oxycodone without relief.  He says he
decr po intake and felt better.  1D PTA felt "woozy, sweaty"
several times, along with new substernal "rib pain" with deep
inspiration (an extension of his previous rib pain).  No
palpitations.  +SOB, with shallow breathing.  Says he talked to
a friend, whom he described his sx, and the friend suggested he
come in.  On arrival to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital, vitals BP: 116/82, P:
116.  EKG was done, showing NSR with ST segment elevation in
leads V1-V6 with Q waves V1-V3.  PT was given
ASA/Lovenox/Lopressor 5mg IV/NTG SL given X3 without relief of
pain.  Given morphine 2mg IV.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath,
started on integrillin.  Taken to cath lab, admitted to CCU for
balloon pump placement for depressed CI and elevated filling
pressures.
Currently, CP remains the same, with decr fatigue, weakness
since yesterday.  Still has difficulty taking deep breath.

LAD occlusion crossed without restoration of flow which was
reestablished after export thrombectomy.  Occlusion stented with
Cypher stent.  After intracoronary NTG, no residual, normal
flow.  Because of markedly elevated filling pressures and low
cardiac output and SBP 80-90, IABP placed.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
with
one vessel disease. The LMCA was without disease
angiographically. The
LAD was occluded after the first diagonal branch in its mid
portion.
There were no collaterals filling the distal vessel. The LCX was
without
flow limiting stenoses. The RCA was without flow limiting
stenoses.
2. limited resting hemodynamics showed moderate pulmonary
hypertension
(PA mean 35 mmHg). The left and right sided filling pressures
were
severely elevated (RVEDP 22 mmHg, PCW mean 33 mmHg). The cardiac
output
was depressed (CO 2.9 l/min, CI 1.4 l/min/m2).
3. Successful thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD
with a 2.5
x 13 mm Cypher DES which was postdilated to 2.75 mm proximally.
Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent
dissection, and
normal epicardial flow (see PTCA comments).
4. Successful insertion of an 8 French 40 cc intraaortic balloon
pump
with good augmentation and unloading.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Subacute anterior myocardial infarction managed by primary
PCI and
deployment of a drug-eluting stent in the mid LAD.
3. Successful balloon pump placement.
4. Severe diastolic dysfunction.
5. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
Echo: [**2184-7-30**]: EF 30-35%
The LA is normal in size. LV wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and
anterior walls. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic.
The distal inferior wall is severely hypokinetic. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. RV chamber size and free
wall motion arenormal. The aortic root, ascending aorta and
aortic arch are mildly dilated. The AV leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated PA systolic pressure is normal. No pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression:
57 y/o man with h/o HTN (other CAD risk factors-smoking, FH+),
presented with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction,
status post cardiac catheterization showing one vessel coronary
artery disease, subacute anterior myocardial infarction managed
by primary PCI and deployment of a drug-eluting stent in the mid
LAD, and complicated by depressed CO and increased PCWP
requiring intra-aortic balloon pump placement.
1.  Cardiac
*Coronary:  Post-cath, the pt was begun on aspirin, plavix,
integrillin drip for 18 hours and a statin.  He was weaned off
the intra-aortic balloon pump successfully.  His hospital course
was complicated by residual chest pain, despite reperfusion
being successful, with evidence of prolonged infarct on EKGs.
This chest pain was difficult to assess as the pt sustained
several rib fractures weeks ago, and had residual
musculoskeletal chest pain because of this.  His pain was
managed well with oxycodone, and at discharge the pt was chest
pain-free.  An ACEI and BB was added to his medication regimen
post-cath when his blood pressure and HR tolerated them, and
these medications were titrated up to optimal blood pressure
control.
*Pump:  With depressed cardiac output and increased PCWP in the
cath lab, although the pt had no clinical evidence of failure.
As stated above, the pt was weaned off IABP successfully.  His
Echocardiogram showed an EF of 30-35% with moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls. The apex
is mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic. The distal inferior wall is
severely hypokinetic. He was subsequently started on coumadin po
and lovenox injections, and his INR will be followed as an
outpatient.  He is to have his INR checked two days post
discharge, with results being called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3321**] or Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 29573**].  He plans to the
