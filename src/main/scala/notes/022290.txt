Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis ([**2166-9-27**])
ERCP wtih stone fragmente extraction and placement of an 11cm by
10FR Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent ([**2166-9-28**])


History of Present Illness:
62F with known metastatic pancreatic cancer, notably to the
liver causing biliary obstruction s/p ERCP with stent placement
[**2166-7-25**] to the left hepatic biliary tree with no opacification
of the right biliary tree presenting with increasing abdominal
distension and pain with nausea and non-bloody loose stool over
the last week. She first noted increasing abdominal distention
approx 2 weeks ago and reports a 5 lb weight gain in the last 2
weeks. Prior to that, she had had anorexia since her diagnosis
in [**Month (only) **], slightly improved with stent placement in [**Month (only) 205**],
significantly worse for the last few days. Also endorses nausea
but no emesis, dull diffuse abd pain most pronounced in the
epigastric and periumbilical regions. No radiation or
exacerbating/relieving factord. Endorses light colored loose
stool 1x/day for the last week as well, denies BRBPR or melena.
She denies productive cough but does endorse chest congestion.
Denies sick contacts. Endorses chills, denies fevers at home.
Denies CP or LE swelling. In addition, she endorses DOE x 1
week. At baseline, she walks around her home with a cane but has
been unable to do so this week. She presented to her PCP when
the distention started and no further workup was undertaken. Her
symptoms continued to progress and she presented to an OSH ED on
[**9-26**]. At the OSH, SBP noted to be in 90s, improved with IVF. CTA
at outside hospital negative for PE, ?possible pneumonia per
report. CT abdomen showed L intrahepatic ductal dilation,
progressive metastases in the liver, new ascites, biliary
obstruction. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continuity of
care.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, inital vitals were 98.4 144 134/70 30 96% 2L.
Labs were notable for lactate 1.9, HCO3 19, ALT 74, AST 149,
Amylase 103, lipase wnl, AP 674, TBili 4, Albumin 3.3, WBC 27
with 96%N. RUQ U/S showed CBD stent in place, pneumobilia in R
liver but no intrahepatic ductal dilation, stable ductal
dilation in L liver as compared with previous MRCP in [**Month (only) 205**], no
evidence of cholangitis. CXR showed no significant change from
prior, no definite focal consolidation, stable cystic lesions in
L lung. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed showing 306 WBC
with 25% PMNs, 628 RBCs, SAAG 2. UA showed neg leuks, neg
nitrites, 1 WBC, no bacteria. She was given 2L NS with HR
improving from 140s to 120s. Hepatology, ERCP, and surgery were
all consulted in the ED. Hepatology and surgery felt there were
no issues for them and ERCP will see in AM, recommended Zosyn.
She also was tachypneic in the ED to 35, was given Combivent
nebs with improvement in wheezes but no improvement in
tachypnea. She appeared to be tiring out and moving toward
intubation and so therapeutic paracentesis was performed with
removal of 1.5L and immediate resolution of tachypnea. She was
given Ceftriaxone 1 gram, Levofloxacin 750mg IV, Zosyn 4.5
grams, Combivent nebs x2, Tylenol 650mg PR for fever 101
rectally, albumin 5% 12.5 grams. VS at transfer: 99.4  120
123/78  20  99% 24% ventimask.

Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she reports her breathing is improved
and she continues to have [**8-13**] abdominal pain.

Peritoneal fluid cytology: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with adenocarcinoma.

RUQ Ultrasound ([**2166-9-26**]): 1. CBD stent in place with pneumobilia
and no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation in the right lobe;
known left lobe biliary dilatation not well appreciated on this
study.
2. Cholelithiasis with wall edema (nonspecific in the setting of
ascites); noMurphy's sign.

CXR ([**2166-9-30**]): In comparison to the prior radiograph, there is
little overall change. Extensive bullous disease is seen on the
left with mediastinal shift to the side and elevation of the
left hemidiaphragm. There is some right basilar atelectasis once
again seen. Otherwise the right lung is clear of any focal
opacities or consolidations concerning for an infectious
process.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. SIRS/Sepsis/Cholangitis: Felt to have cholangitis from
extrinsic biliary obstruction. Treated with pip-tazo with
vancomycin initially. Cultures remained negative and given
likely biliary source, plan was to complete 10 day course with
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.

2. Pancreatic cancer, complicated by:
   - Liver metastases
   - Biliary obstruction
   - Malignant ascites
Underwent diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis with removal
of 1.5 liters; fluid was positive for malignant cells. Underwent
ERCP with placement of plastic stent inside prior metal stent;
stent obstruction from tumor ingrowth was noted. Two stone
fragments were extracted using a balloon. Palliative care
followed patient and case was discussed with outpatient oncology
team.

Patient requested DNR/DNI status though she and her family were
not yet interested in hospice services.

3. Tachypnea: Most likely related to lung compression from
ascites; improved after removal of fluid.

4. Anemia: Most likely secondary to of chronic disease given
malignancy.

5. Diabetes type II, controlled without complications. Sliding
scale insulin was used while in patient.
