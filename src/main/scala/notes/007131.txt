History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 35-year-old
gentleman with a history of many years of diabetes mellitus has
had associated retinopathy, neuropathy, and atherosclerosis.
His main symptoms at this time are continued chest pain syndrome
occurring now both with exertion and at rest.  He has had a
diagnosis of coronary artery disease for a number of years and
had two LAD bare-metal stents placed in [**2100**].  He has had
medical management until recently with continuing chronic chest
pain.  Last week cardiac catheterization revealed severe three-
vessel disease and he presents today for evaluation for CABG.
Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 **] on [**2109-4-19**] showed an
ejection fraction of 45-50%.  A right femoral artery Perclose
device was used.  There was a right dominant system, LAD has two
major lesions of 70% and 90% around the areas of the stent, and
a 50% proximal diagonal 1 lesion.  In addition, the circumflex
has a small OM1 with only mild disease, but the ostium of the
inferior pole of the OM2 has a 70% lesion.  Right coronary is
dominant but relatively small with extensive diffuse
disease.  There is a 99% subtotal occlusion of the RCA.

disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, elevated
lipids, hypertension, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease,
and chronic back issues with neuropathy down both legs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12740**] was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2109-5-22**] where he underwent coronary artery
bypass x 3 as detailed in the operative note.  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in critical but stable condition for
observation and recovery.  POD 1 found the patient extubated,
alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  He was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, on no
inotropic or vasopressor support.  He does have a history of
diabetes mellitus, and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for assistance with
blood glucose management.  We appreciate their recommendations.
The patient was transferred to telemetry on POD 1.  Chest tubes
and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient progressed through the cardiac surgery pathway without
incident.  On the day of discharge, he was noted to have minor
sternal erythema about the superior 2" of his sternotomy
incision.  There was no drainage or leukocytosis and the patient
was afebrile.  He was started on levaquin (multiple antibiotic
allergies) for this reason.  He was cleared by PT and discharged
to home with VNA services and appropriate follow up instructions
on POD 4.
