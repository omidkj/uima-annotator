HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 6359**] is a 73 year-old man
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
recent postop aspiration pneumonia who presents with
shortness of breath and right sided chest pain.  He was in
his usual state of health until one week ago when he noted
cough and nasal congestion.  His symptoms were initially
limited so he decided to proceed with a flight from
[**State 4565**] to [**Location (un) 86**] to attend his granddaughter's fifth
birthday party.  One day prior to admission he noticed
worsening shortness of breath and cough now accompanied by
chills with occasional shaking as well as right sided chest
pain that his worse with deep inspiration.  When his symptoms
persisted he proceeded to the Emergency Department.  In the
Emergency Department CTA was obtained, which was negative for
PE, but it did show bibasilar consolidations.  He was also
noted to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response.  He was given 20 mg of intravenous Diltiazem just
prior to being seen by the Medicine team.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic sinusitis, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, postop aspiration pneumonia in [**2171-6-18**], hypertension, cerebrovascular accident six years ago
and status post removal of tumor from penis in [**2163**].

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Advair, Norvasc and aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  Keflex, Penicillin and Percocet.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died at 39 from tuberculosis.  Sister
with history of [**Name (NI) 5895**] disease and father died at 73
from an myocardial infarction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Smoked a pack per day times thirty six
years.  Quit in [**2151**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 97.9.  Pulse 130.
Blood pressure 106/65.  O2 sat 92% on room air.  In general,
the patient appears in mild respiratory distress with
audible upper airway congestion, fatigue.  HEENT is
anicteric.  Small pupils, reactive.  Dry mucous membranes.
No oral lesions.  Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs are coarse upper airway breath sounds throughout.  Good
air movements.  Heart is tachycardic, irregularly irregular.

nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  No calf
tenderness or swelling.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell 6.4, hematocrit 33.2, potassium
3.1.  Liver function tests were normal.  CK and troponin were
normal.  Chest CT revealed bilateral lower lobe
consolidations posteriorly, small right pleural effusion,
trace left pleural effusion, no pulmonary embolus, small
subcentimeter bilateral hilar lymph nodes, prevascular
pretracheal and subcarinal.  Electrocardiogram was atrial
fibrillation at 126 with T wave inversions in 3 and T wave
flattening in Q and AVF.  Compared with [**2165**] only the atrial
fibrillation and the T wave inversion in lead 3 are new.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pulmonary:  The patient developed severe
multilobar pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation and was transferred immediately to the
Intensive Care Unit from the floor, because of low blood
pressure.  In the Intensive Care Unit he continued to receive
antibiotics including Levofloxacin and Flagyl for Methacillin
sensitive staph aureus and possible aspiration pneumonia as
well as nebulizers, chest physical therapy, Guaifenesin.  His
lung examination improved as he was transferred to the floor
and at the time of discharge.

Atrial fibrillation:  This resolved and he returned to [**Location 213**]
sinus rhythm at the time of discharge.

Gastrointestinal:  The patient was kept on Colace and Senna
for constipation and Protonix for peptic ulcer disease
prophylaxis and for a history of gastroesophageal reflux
disease.

Endocrine:  The patient received a steroid taper since he
received stress dose steroids in the MICU, because of concern
about adrenal insufficiency.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient is to be discharged to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Levofloxacin 500 mg po q.d. for
fourteen days total, Flagyl 500 mg po t.i.d. for fourteen
