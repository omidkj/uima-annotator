Admission Date:  [**2117-2-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2117-3-4**]


Service:  [**Location (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89 year old female
with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure,
and recent admission for pancreatitis/syncope, now presents with
hypotension and hypothermia.  The patient was recently discharged
one day prior to admission to an [**Hospital3 **] center with
[**Hospital6 407**] after being treated for pancreatitis.
Today the patient noticed some dizziness in the morning.  After
the dizziness, she later developed some abdominal pain.  She did
fall, collapsed, and then called Life Line.  She was brought to
the Emergency Department by the emergency medical services with
blood pressure 60s/palpable.  She was hypothermic with rectal
temperature of 94.  In the Emergency Room the patient had
significant abdominal pain and diarrhea which was nonbloody
and guaiac negative.  She received 2 liters of normal saline
with appropriate increase in blood pressure to systolics of
120s to 160s and temperature to 97.3 rectally.  The white count
was markedly increased as well as the hematocrit and creatinine
from baseline.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Syncope status post DDD pacer placed
in [**2116-12-26**], atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation,
congestive heart failure with a [**2116-3-25**] echocardiogram
revealing an ejection fraction of 45%, 3+ mitral regurgitation
and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, hypertension, coronary artery
disease with myocardial infarction in [**2111**] with the [**2117-2-23**]
stress ushering fixed inferior defect, chronic renal
insufficiency with creatinine of 1.4 to 2 and diverticulitis,
asthma and vertigo.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home were
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o.
q.d., Toprol XL 25 mg p.o. q.d., Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,
Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Evista 60 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 10
mg p.o. q.d., Multivitamin one tablet p.o. q.d., Folate 1 mg
p.o. q.d., Thiamine 100 mg p.o. q.d., Singulair 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Combivent 2 puffs q. 6 hours.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in an [**Hospital3 **]
center with [**Hospital6 407**] services.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at the time of
admission is temperature 97.3 with heartrate of 60 to 70,
blood pressure 120 to 160/60 to 80, respiratory rate 12,
oxygen saturation 97% on room air.  Generally, this patient
is in no acute distress with skin warm and dry.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat, oropharynx clear with mucous membranes
that are dry.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or
jugulovenous distension.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, II/VI systolic ejection murmur.
Lungs are scattered rhonchi bilaterally.  Abdomen, soft, mild
distention with diffuse tenderness with left lower quadrant
greater than left upper quadrant.  There are normoactive
bowel sounds.  Stools, guaiac negative per Emergency
Department nursing.  Extremities, no edema, palpable distal
pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission revealed
white count 30 with 79% neutrophils, 3% bands, 18%
lymphocytes with a hematocrit of 49.1, platelets 277, sodium
137, potassium 5.7, chloride 99, bicarbonate 22, BUN 32,
creatinine 2.4, glucose 144, INR 1.3, PTT 30.9, PT 13.8.  ALT
38, AST 77, alkaline phosphatase 109, total bilirubin 0.8,
amylase 214, lipase 167, LDH 620, lactate 3.8, troponin 0.3.
Urinalysis showed 0-2 white blood cells, 0 red blood cells,
1.01 and urine culture pending.  Chest x-ray showed no acute
cardiopulmonary processes.  KUB showed no signs of
obstruction, nonspecific bowel/gas pattern.  Computerized
tomography scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed colonic wall
thickening at the splenic flexure with minimal stranding and
small amount of free fluid which is consistent with ischemia
versus infection.  Electrocardiogram was AV paced.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastroenterology - Ischemic colitis and
pancreatitis, the patient was initially NPO.  She was rehydrated
with 8 liters of intravenous fluids while in the Medicine
Intensive Care Unit.  She was also given intravenous proton pump
inhibitors twice a day.  She was also covered with Ampicillin,
Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Though Surgery felt that she was a good
surgical candidate, the patient did not desire surgery at this
time.  Stool guaiac continued to be negative while in the
Medicine Intensive Care Unit.  It did become positive when she
was transferred to the Medical Floor after spending one day in
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Her lactate level did decrease
down to 1.6 from 2.8 with intravenous hydration.  We continued
hydration.  Her pancreatic enzymes decreased down to an amylase
of 77 and lipase of 27 with triple antibiotic and intravenous
fluids.  The patient's systolic blood pressure was kept in the
140s to 150s for intestinal perfusion.  Her abdominal examination
did improve with less tenderness to palpation on examination.
She was then advanced to clear liquid diet while being supported
with total parenteral nutrition for nutrition.  She did well on
the clear liquid diet without any problems with pain or excessive
blood per rectum.  All antihypertensives were held so that her
systolic blood pressure could be kept up.  Surgery recommended a
full ten day course of the Ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient had a lot of problems with wheezing
that was secondary to her asthma.  Her chest x-ray did not show
any evidence of congestive heart failure that may be causing any
cardiac wheezes.  She was given Flovent and Combivent inhaler.
Given that she could not fully utilize these inhalers correctly,
she was given Atrovent nebulizers on a scheduled q.i.d. basis.
She was also given Albuterol nebulizers but that was kept as prn
because it has caused some tachycardia.

3.  Infectious disease - The patient's leukocytosis did decrease
down from 43 to 16 with triple antibiotic.  She was given a full
ten day course of these antibiotics.  One out of four blood
cultures did grow gram positive cocci on [**2117-2-28**] but this
was felt to be a contaminate.  Blood cultures were drawn on [**2117-3-2**] but there has been no growth to date.

4.  Hematology - The patient's hematocrit did drop down to 27.5.
Hemolysis laboratory data were checked but found to be negative,
given the normal LDH at 379, total bilirubin of 0.6 and
haptoglobin of 91.  Her anemia was then attributed to some blood
loss in her stool secondary to the ischemic colitis.  Given her
coronary artery disease history, she was given 1 unit of packed
red blood cells and responded appropriately from 27.5 to 31.9.
The patient also had some thrombocytopenia going down to 101. Her
Pepcid was discontinued after she started eating food.  Also her
subcutaneous heparin was discontinued and Pneuma boots were
placed instead.  Her platelets did then increase back up to 107.
