History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname 74676**] is a 64F discharged to rehab 2d prior for admission
after mechanical fall and bilateral wrist fx p/w lethargy, now
presenting with lethargy and respiratory distress.  Per
patient's husband, she had been doing well after recent
discharge, however he had visited her in rehab earlier today and
noted that she was more lethargic than usual.  Later on this
evening in rehab pt was noted to be more somnolent, without
increased SOB or difficulty breathing, and therefore EMS was
called.  On arrival to the nursing facility, EMS noted a L
facial droop.  According to her family, pt had no other
complaints leading up to this event.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 78% on RA RR 20-30, HR 80-100,
BPs 150-180 systolic.  Pt was initially interacting with family
but became confused and unable to answer questions, was SOB with
hypoxia to the 70s on 3 L NC.  She was given oxycodone and nebs.
 Given her desaturations to the 70s with tachycardic
hypertension and hypercarbia, pt was intubated.  CXR showed
severe emphysema, head CT was negative.  Rectal exam was
performed given severe crit drop and was negative.  Pt was also
seen by neuro out of concern for stroke, however this was
thought to be unlikely.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2178-8-7**]:
IMPRESSION: COPD. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CXR [**2178-8-8**]:
The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened,
consistent with COPD. There is probable mild cardiomegaly. There
is upper zone
redistribution, without other definite evidence of CHF. There is
slight
prominence of markings at both lung bases, new compared with
[**2178-8-7**]. These
could represent small pneumonic infiltrates or areas aspiration.
The
differential includes an atypical distribution of CHF, in the
setting of
considerable parenchymal scarring, but this is considered less
likely.

Focal density in the right lung apex appears to represent
overlap of vascular and osseous shadows. Attention to this area
on followup films is recommended.

CT HEAD W/O:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR [**2178-8-8**]:
ET tube is in standard position. The tip is 5.7 cm above the
carina. NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion. The lungs are
hyperinflated consistent with emphysema. Atelectases in the left
base are
minimal.

CTA CHEST [**2178-8-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
No CT evidence of central or segmental pulmonary emboli.
Panlobular emphysema.
Atelectatis in the right lower lobe, right middle lobe and
lingula.
Stable calcified right adrenal nodule which is likely a sequela
to previous adrenal hemorrhage.

CXR [**2178-8-14**]:
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. The lungs are
hyperinflated consistent with emphysema. There are no lung
consolidations or evidence of pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo woman with history of COPD, presenting from rehab with AMS
and lethargy most likely secondary to opioid use, found to be in
respiratory distress with hypercarbia and hypoxia. Pt was
intubated and transferred to the MICU.

# Lethargy/AMS: Initial AMS most likely secondary to medication
effect. Patient presented with AMS and lethargy, however was
responsive and interactive.  O2 requirements and somnolence
worsened after a dose of oxycodone while in the ED. MS [**First Name (Titles) 1095**] [**Last Name (Titles) 41963**]d by hypercarbia/hypoxia.  Low concern for infectious
process initially given no fever, leukocytosis or localizing
symptoms prior on admission, nl UA. Cultures revealed no growth
to date including blood, sputum, urine, and stool. Her mental
status cleared as her hypercarbia improved.

# Hypoxia, hypercarbic respiratory distress: Likely due to
COPD/severe emphysema on 3-5L home O2 and FEV1=13% predicted.
Given recent surgery and sudden onset of sympoms, also
considered PE given hypoxia out of proportion to lung disease
and ruled out with CTA. No signs of PNA or COPD flare and the
inciting insult causing her respiratory failure was thought to
be oversedation in someone who is very sensitive given her very
poor lung function. Pt was extubated on HOD#1; however, pt again
had hypercarbia, and dyspnea requiring re-intubation. She was
started on IV steroids and Azithromycin for COPD exacerbation
for optimization. She was able to be weaned off the ventilator
