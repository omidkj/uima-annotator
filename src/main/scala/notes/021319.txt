Abdominal pain, Shortness of breath and cough

Liver mass biopsy
[**2137-8-30**] ex lap, Debridement of liver tumor.

History of Present Illness:
30M with h/o chronic hep B (HbeAg+, HbeAg-, VL undetectable
[**7-/2137**]) on epivir and adefovir, with newly diagnosed large liver
mass by MRI (followed by [**Doctor Last Name **]) who presented to ED with acute
worsening of RUQ pain and shoulder pain at 12am. Pt states that
he has had similar episodes of abdominal pain over the past [**3-10**]
months which he has treated with tylenol.  He also reports
intermittant cough dyspnea on exertion over the same time
period. Pt was given the news of cancer by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 2 days
prior to presentation.

ED vitals were afebrile, 69, 102/47, 99%RA. In ED, received
morphine and dilaudid for pain. No change in liver mass by
ultrasound.CTA done which showed multiple PEs. Patient
Type/Crossed and 2IVs placed. Spoke with Liver fellow and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and plan to hold on anticoagulation for PE as risk of
bleeding/rupture of liver mass was higher than risk of PE.
Patent continued to be hemodynamically stable with O2 sat of 99%
on RA, and was sent to floor for further eval.

On arrival, patient was in [**7-16**] abdominal pain, but otherwise
denies SOB.

Brief Hospital Course:
30M with h/o chronic hep B with cirrhosis and with newly
diagnosed large liver mass by MRI presenting with acute RUQ pain
and also found to have subsegmental pulmonary embolisms. He
underwent liver biopsy on the morning of admission. There were
no complications of the biopsy.  Pathology reports were
indicative of hepatocellular carcinoma, moderately
differentiated.  The patient continued to have RUQ pain for
several days post biopsy which was well controlled. Heparin IV
was initially held prior to liver biopsy then started and
titrated for ptt goal of 60-80. This was transitioned to lovenox
Last HBV VL was undetectable. LFTs were midly elevated but he
exhibitd no synthetic dysfunction.  He was continued on his home
medications of lamivudine and adefovir.
.
[**Name (NI) 25933**] Pt was afebrile on admission, however on [**8-21**], he spiked
a fever to 102.  CXRay was without evidence of infiltrate,
consolidation or effusion.  He was started on levaquin, but
continued to spike fevers nightly.  Daily blood and urine
cultures remained negative.  Disscussion with the patient
revealed a 2 month hx of fever which he had been treating at
home with steam therapy.  On [**8-26**], the patient again spiked a
fever to 103.4.  The patient reported having a big cough which
caused him to expell a small amount of red sputum.  A CT torso
was obtained which showed changes suggestive of infarct or
sequela of a septic embolus.  The patient finished an 8 day
course of antibiotic. He was afebrile in the 24 hours prior to
surgery.

Cough- The patient complained of cough which had been bothering
him for several months.  Further description of symptoms
revealed some obvious allergic components.  The patient was
started on [**Doctor First Name 130**] and albuterol with improvement of throat
irritation.  He continued to have intermittant cough and on the
evening of [**8-26**], the patient reported coughing up a small about
of red blood.  A CT chest was obtained which was notable for
peribronchovascular opacities.  Pulmonology was consulted who
felt that these changes were consistant with resolving
bronchopneumonia or reaction to aspirated blood.

Given his diagnosis, cancer staging was peformed and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (Hepatobiliary surgeon) was consulted and the patient was
evaluated for resection. He remained in hospital until [**8-30**] when
he was taken to the OR and underwent  debridement of liver tumor
with resection and primary repair of diaphragm.  Operative
findings were notable for a large tumor mass involving the dome
of the right liver, including segments VII, VIII and extending
to the junction with the middle hepatic vein. Intraoperative
ultrasound demonstrated thrombus in the middle hepatic vein. The
left lateral segment was clear of tumor. The mass was necrotic
and adherent to the diaphragm. He received intrathecal morphine
for postop analgesia with intermittent iv morphine for
breakthrough.

PACU was uneventful. He was extubated without event and
transferred to the SICU given anesthesia. Pain was well
controlled. He returned to the Med-[**Doctor First Name **] unit on pod 2 where he
continue to receive a dilaudid pca.

On pod 1, hct decreased to 24 from 32. Two units of PRBC were
transfused. He continued to spike on pod 2 to 101.6. Blood and
urine cultures have been negative to date. he was encouraged to
use incentive [**Location (un) **].

Diet was advanced slowly and tolerated. He was assisted to
ambulate. The foley was removed on pod 3 without incident. The
JP continued to drain serosanuinous fluid. Drainage decreaesd to
10cc/day. PCA was converted to po oxycodone. This was switched
after a few days as he continue to complain of poor pain control
with pain on the right side.

Pathology demonstrated hepatocellular carcinoma moderately
differentiated, with extensive necrosis. Residual, subcapsular
liver with dense fibrosis and bile ductular proliferation.

He remianed on the heparin drip and was started on Coumadin. He
was treated with 1 unit FFP for supertherapeutic INR on day 3 of
Coumadin. He stabilized and was d/c'd home on 2mg Coumadin, INR
to be followed by Hepatology.

On discharge the patient is ambulating, tolerating diet. Pain
managed with PO pain meds. He will be followed as outpatient
with social work services in
