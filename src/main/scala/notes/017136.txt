Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3283**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of tunneled catheter for hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
84 y/o M w/hx of DM, ESRD approaching HD, HTN, presented to the
ED with 2 days of increasing dyspnea. Per admitting team,
"states he woke up in the middle of the night with SOB. Denied
CP. Has been having worsening DOE over the past few months, now
would be dyspneic if he walked up a flight of stairs. Also has
had worsening LE edema over the past few months. Has never had
CP with this. Did have stress in [**2169**] that was normal. In terms
of renal disease, had AVF placed [**1-21**] in anticipation of HD but
has not required it as of yet.
.
In the ED, was initially hypertensive in the 200s. Was hypoxic
to 96% on 4L. CXR showed moderate to severe pulmonary edema, so
he was placed on bipap. He received lasix 80 mg IV x1, and put
out 80 cc. He was placed on a nitro gtt. EKG showed ST
elevations in V2-V3 which were worse from prior. His troponin
was 0.18 with a CK of 1135 (although MB negative) so he was
given aspirin and placed on a heparin gtt. He was seen by
cardiology who performed a bedside echo; it did not show any
wall motion abnormalities, so they felt this was not a cardiac
problem and recommended admission to the MICU. Renal saw him in
the ED and recommended lasix 160 mg IV with diuril 500 mg IV, to
which he put out 60 cc."

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, was initially hypertensive in the 200s. Was hypoxic
to 96% on 4L. CXR showed moderate to severe pulmonary edema, so
he was placed on bipap. He received lasix 80 mg IV x1, and put
out 80 cc. He was placed on a nitro gtt. EKG showed ST
elevations in V2-V3 which were worse from prior. His troponin
was 0.18 with a CK of 1135 (although MB negative) so he was
given aspirin and placed on a heparin gtt. He was seen by
cardiology who performed a bedside echo; it did not show any
wall motion abnormalities, so they felt this was not a cardiac
problem and recommended admission to the MICU. Renal saw him in
the ED and recommended lasix 160 mg IV with diuril 500 mg IV, to
which he put out 60 cc."

Patient's respiratory status and symptoms improved while in
MICU, so he was weaned from bipap to nasal cannula, then weaned
off nitro gtt and called out to floor.

At the time of arrival to the floor, patient said his dyspnea
had improved somewhat, and this continued to resolve over the
next few days.

# Hypoxia: Resolved quickly with diuresis, nitro.  Most likely
diagnosis was flash pulmonary edema, given the sudden onset,
symptoms of orthopnea/PND, worsening renal failure and LE edema,
and findings on physical exam. CXR read questions aspiration,
but pt gives no hx of this and has no signs or symptoms of
infection on exam. The underlying question is why he suddenly
flashed overnight: ? if he became hypertensive and then flashed
vs the hypertension as a response to the hypoxia. Most likely
diagnosis is myocardial ischemia, given his numerous risk
factors, EKG findings, and cardiac enzymes. Other possibility is
that his EKG findings and cardiac enzymes are a result of (and
not the cause of) his hypertension. Likely has volume overload
related to worsening renal failure.
- now on RA with no respiratory symptoms
- will likely be less problem[**Name (NI) 115**] now that patient has started
HD as below.
- TTE with NL EF, mild aortic regurgitation
- on discharge, patient will continue aspirin, beta-blocker,
CCB, statin

# Fever: Two days prior to discharge, patient had T to 100.9,
then to 101.1 the following night. No new sx, nothing on exam to
suggest etiology. Tunneled line site without erythema or TTP.
-Patient was found to have UTI by UA/Cx which was felt to
explain fever given otherwise very well-appearing patient with
no other clinical findings
-CXR with no infiltrate
-Blood cx pending, negative at time of discharge
Discharged on cipro for total course of 7 days for UTI.

# Anemia: Likely due to renal disease.  However, acute drop from
29.3 to 25.3 from [**Date range (1) 5568**]/07.  Given 1uPRBC per renal recs, with
appropriate response.
- guaiac negative
- cont aranesp
remained stable throughout rest of hospitalization.

#. Neck Mass: patient with known thyroid CA.  CXR revealed
tracheal shift, but this was stable compared to prior CXR's, and
was present prior to line placement. Currently asymptomatic.

# ESRD: Access attempt made on fistula, but infiltrated.  HD
tunneled line placed and HD initiated with this line.  Patient
tolerated well.  Now s/p dialysis on Friday, Saturday, Monday.
Pt. tolerating well.
- outpt dialysis arranged for pt.

# DM: Fingersticks had been poorly controlled. Avandia recently
discontinued, ? if due to new data regarding increased risk of
MI.  Pt was controlled on SSI while in hospital; outpatient
glipizide regimen resumed upon discharge.
.
# HTN: Patient required nitro gtt, lasix gtt in addition to his
usual antihypertensive regimen until HD was initiated, at which
point BP's became easier to control.
However, still with SBP's as high as 140's-150's, HR in 70's, so
beta blockade and nifedipine were increased slightly.

# Hyperlipidemia: Cont atorvastatin.
.
# FEN:
