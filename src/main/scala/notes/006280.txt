History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is a 64y.o. woman h/o COPD (on 2L home O2) and CHF
(most recent EF=55%) presenting from her PCP's office with RA O2
sat of 52-64%.  Per the pt's report, she had been feeling in her
usual state of health during her routine visit with her PCP this
morning; she reports that on exam, her O2 sat was low (54-62%
per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 626**]) and he asked her to come to the ED.  Of note, pt
is normally on 2L O2 at home, but has not used her home O2
x24hrs.  The pt reports an ongoing cough productive of yellow
phlegm for the past two months, but denies any hemoptysis or
recent worsening of this cough.  She also reports rhinorrhea x1
wk.  Pt reports that she previously had one episode of chest
pressure and SOB w/exertion 3 days ago, but that both of these
symptoms improved with OTC Theraflu.  Currently, pt denies any
chest pressure, chest pain, radiating pain, pleuritic pain, SOB,
diaphoresis or nausea.  Otherwise, she denies any recent
fevers/chills.  She denies any PND or sleep orthopnea (1
pillow).

In the ED, initial VS were T 98.6, HR 100, BP 154/86, RR 22, O2
sat 89% 4L Nasal Cannula. Exam notable for bibasilar crackles
greater than wheezes.  Labs were notable for WBC 6.9 (66.5 PMN,
27.2 lymph), Hct 44.5, Plt 219.  Chem 7 with  K 2.8, BUN 24 and
Cr 1.1 (baseline 0.5-0.7).  Tnt was negative and proBNP 2873 (BL
479 in 09/[**2180**]).  Lactate was 2.0. Blood cx are pending. CXR
notable for persistent moderate enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with possible minimal pulmonary vascular congestion
but without overt pulmonary edema. Pt was given albuterol nebs
x2, ipratropium nebs x2, furosemide 40 mg IV, KCl 50 mEq PO,
methylprednisode 125mg and started on arithromycin 250mg.  She
was placed on NRB, satting in mid-90s. Headed for floor, but
every time she dozed off, O2 sats down to 70s - 80s. Tried BIPAP
and CPAP, but did not tolerate.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the pt reports feeling "great," in no
acute distress.  Her O2 sats are in the low 90s, but will desat
to low-mid 80s with any activity and sleep.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness,  or congestion. Reports
alternating diarrhea and constipation x2mos; denies abdominal
pain. Denies dysuria, hematuria, pyuria. Reports left shoulder
pain x3 yrs. Denies rashes or skin changes.

Imaging-
CXR ([**2180-11-23**]): Persistent moderate enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with possible minimal pulmonary vascular congestion
but without overt pulmonary edema.
CXR ([**2180-11-24**]): Stable moderate cardiomegaly with slight
increase in mild interstitial edema. Increasing right basilar
opacity could reflect developing pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute exacerbation of COPD: The patient has used oxygen
supplementation (2L) at home for "many years".  There were
reports that she had not used her home oxygen for 24 hours prior
to admission or that it was not fully functional.  She was found
to have diffuse wheezing throughout and oxygen on 4L NS in
mid-90s w/desats to low to mid-80s with activity and sleep.  Her
symptoms were most consistent with COPD exacerbation in the
setting of limited to no home oxygen for a day compounded by URI
symptoms (rhinorrhea) with on going cough and increased sputum
production.  Her poor respiratory status was also likely
complicated by concurrent CHF exacerbation, particularly in
setting of missed furosemide dose

She was admitted to the ICU due to her low oxygen saturations.
She was given iprtropium/albuterol nebulizer treatments, a five
day course of azithromycin, and a 10 day course of prednisone
(40 mg).  She was transferred to the general medical floor when
she was satting in the low to mid 90s on her home 2L of oxygen.
Her exam improved and upon discharge, she had no wheezing with
good air entry.

2. Atrial flutter/fibrillation: During her MICU course, she
developed aflutter, and her metoprolol dose was increased.  She
was monitored on telemetry and was found to be alternating
between normal sinus and atrial fibrillation.  Prior to
discharge, she was noted to be persistently tachycardic with
heart rates ranging from 110-120s and
