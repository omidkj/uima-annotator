Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: confusion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.


History of Present Illness:
66 y/o male with sleep apnea, HTN, anxiety/depression, ADD,
chronic LBP presents with acute AMS (confusion).
.
Patient unable to describe chief complaint in ED. Wife states he
was rigoring for 2-3 hours last night. He never checked his
temperature. He proceeded to walk to the restroom, and called
out to his wife that he was walking to the bathroom, but
instead, he walked into the closet and urinated there. He was
heard to become unstable and become off balance. He returned to
bed disoriented. He again urinated in the bed and his wife
brought him in. She denies any recent head trauma or falls. Of
note, at baseline, he is quite healthy with normal mental
status. No reported trauma or fall.
.
Per discussion with patient and wife at bedside, he has had
severe arthritic pain x 2 weeks. He was in his USOH until
yesterday PM, when he felt very sore with diffuse muscle aches.
He also reported nausea without vomiting along with chills. His
wife noted increased breathing rate. She also reports confusion
over 2-3 days. He reports cough, without sputum production.
.
ROS notable for some night sweats, no fever, some ataxia but
increased loss of balance PTA. No recent hospitalizations. No
recent travel or sick contacts. Of note, he received pneumonia
vaccine and influenza vaccine 2 weeks ago.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  100.4 106 131/53 16 90% RA. Exam
with non-focal neuro exam.
Labs notable for WBC 5.3, INR 1.2, Stox negative, Cr 1.0,
lactate 1.6, U/A wnl. Bcx and Ucx pending.
CXR showing multifocal pneumonia
Head CT without acute process
EKG showing new RBBB and ST changes, but CE's negative.
.
Pt was given vancomyzin, zosyn, and 3L IVF. He subsequently
required Bipap for increasing and persistent tachypnea. Most
recent ABG 7.47/31/140 on Bipap. Per ED, intubation was
discussed but unable to rationalize it currently. He "appeared
to improve" with mental status which was improved to AOx2.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Left bundle-branch block. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Intra-atrial conduction defect. Since
the previous tracing of [**2171-8-22**] left bundle-branch block has
appeared as well as prominent voltage.
Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T

.
ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trace mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).

Chest PA/Lateral:
There is confluent consolidation in the right and left lower
lungs which on the lateral view correspond to opacities
overlying the heart and the lower lumbar spine, findings which
raise the concern for multifocal pneumonia in the right middle
and bilateral lower lobes. No pleural effusions are evident.
There is no pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema is new from prior
examination. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
normal limits.
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal basilar opacities concerning for multifocal
pneumonia
2. New mild pulmonary edema though no pleural effusions

CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
territorial
infarction. Ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent consistent
with age
related involutional changes. There is mild mucosal thickening
of the right sphenoid sinus as well as polyp or mucus retention
cyst in the left frontal sinus. The remainder of the visualized
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are
clear. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o male with HTN, sleep apnea, anxiety/depression, ADD,
chronic LBP presents with acute mental status changes and
confusion, found to have multifocal pneumonia, with dramatic
improvement after administration of antibiotics.
.
# Severe multifocal community acquired pneumonia: CURB 65 score
is 3, implying severe community acquired pneumonia with 14%
30-day mortality. No recent hospitalizations, no recent rehab
stay, and no risk factors to suggest MDR organism. Of note, did
recently receive pneumonia vaccine and flu vaccine.  Patient was
admitted to ICU for respiratory monitoring.  He received
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin for severe ICU
admission requiring community acquired pneumonia.  Patient's
mental status and respiratory status rapidly improved with
antibiotics and he was called out of the MICU. Patient continued
to improve on the floor, and did not have any need for O2.
Patient was transitioned to PO antibiotic regimen of
doxycycline/levoquin for a total of 7 days.

# Altered mental status: Most likely [**2-28**] infection although
other possibilities were considered such as seizure (possible
given report of ? shaking/rigors/incontinence), or intracranial
insult such as ICH (less likely given normal head CT and no
reported trauma). Serum tox was negat
