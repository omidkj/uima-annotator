Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Right middle lobe syndrome

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2133-3-27**]: VATS converted to open thoracotomy RML lobectomy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12130**] is a 79 year old male s/p RULobectomy by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2130-6-12**] for Stage 1A squamous cell carcinoma with
clean margins (0.2cm distance from bronchial margin) with
recurrent RML PNA s/p RULobectomy. The pt notes that he has had
recurrent RML PNA, averaging an episode every other month, since
his initial RULobectomy. Pt also has a stable O2 requirement of
2L NC s/p RULobectomy. He underwent a rigid/flex bronch and
balloon dilation w/stent placement on [**2133-2-9**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
However, the stent was not visualized on CT or bronchoscopy
after
the procedure and was likely coughed out. Pt's last episode of
PNA required hospitalization ending on [**2-12**] at [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital. Pt is being referred for evaluation of RMLobectomy for
RML syndrome by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

The pt notes on ROS that he has DOE that is increased from his
baseline since his last episode of PNA. Continues to have a
minimally productive cough of non-bloody sputum. Pt reports
improving black diarrhea without sig abd pain, N/V since his
recent course of PO antibiotics for PNA. Pt has a hx of a GI
bleed 1-2 years ago, but is unable to provide further details.
Notes reproducible RUQ pain with bending over that has lasted
for
several months. Denies fevers, chills, nightsweats, recent
changes in weight, headache. Pt denies chest pain, palpitations.

CXR:
[**2133-4-9**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Minimal increase in severity of the pre-existing left
parenchymal
opacities. The diffuse right parenchymal opacities are stable.
No newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities. Moderate retrocardiac
atelectasis.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No pneumothorax.
Unchanged course of the left-sided PICC line.

[**2133-4-2**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Left lower and upper lobe pneumonia.
3. Interval increase in size of mediastinal lymph nodes, most
likely
reactive.
4. Small residual right hilar hematoma after right middle
lobectomy.

[**2133-4-3**]: Echocardiogram
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Due to sub-optimal image
quality a regional wall motion cannot be fully excluded. Mildly
dilated aortic root. No clinically signficant valvular disease.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12130**] was admitted [**2133-3-27**] following Video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery converted to open thoracotomy, right
middle lobectomy, pericardial fat pad buttress, and bronchoscopy
with bronchoalveolar lavage.  He was extubated in the operating
room and transfer to the TSICU for respiratory and hemodynamic
close monitoring.  He transfer to the floor [**2133-3-31**]. On [**4-2**]
he developed respiratory failure requiring transfer to the ICU.
A CT done [**2133-4-2**] showed Left lobe pneumonia, no pulmonary
embolism. Antibiotics were continued and he improved.  He
transfer back to the floor.  He did well for a few days then
again developed respiratory distress requiring transfer back to
the unit for volume overload.  He was aggressively diuresed,
pneumonia improved and transfer back to the floor on [**2133-4-9**] in
stable condition.

Pulmonary: aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs, good pain control
his oxygen requirements improved to 97% 3L NC

Chest-tubes: posterior and anterior apical were to suction
initially with persistent air-leak then to water-seal.  On
[**2133-3-30**] the posterior apical tube was removed.

Chest films: Diffuse bilateral interstitial pulmonary
infiltrates consistent with
edema. confluent density at the left lung base which improved.
The diffuse right parenchymal opacities are stable

Cardiac: Episode of RAF 140's converted to SR with IV Lopressor,
he was restarted on his home dose of Diltiazem 120 mg daily.
Over the course of his hospital stay he intermittent SVT 140's.
His Diltiazem was changed to immediate release and increased to
60 mg qid with good rate control 80-90's  His cardiac enzymes
were negative.  Echocardiogram [**2133-4-2**] revealed Normal left
ventricular cavity size w
