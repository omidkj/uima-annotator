Pt is a 83 y.o. male with h/o CLL receiving bendamustine/Rituxan
(last dose 7/16), asthma, and recurrent pneumonia, and a recent
admission to BMT service [**7-21**] for fevers. A sputum culture at
that time was positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans. He was discharged
on azithromycin and fluconazole (with plan to cont. fluconazole
indefinitely). He also rec'd IVIG in clinic on [**8-2**]. He was seen
again in heme/onc clinic on [**8-9**] at which time he was afebrile,
but cont. to experience cough, now with blood-tinged and brown
sputum.

He reports that he was is his usual state of health last night.
This morning he felt disoriented. His family felt that he was
confused, not remembering where the bathroom was in his house,
not answered all questions, incontinent of urine x 1. His family
took him in the car and drove him to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Review of systems
is significant for recent 7 lb weight loss over last few months
(18 lbs in last 1+years). Also in the last 2 days having some
neck stiffness - he thought it was the placement of his computer
at work. He has chronic nasal congestion and cough. No increase
in sputum production, no new nasal discharge. Denies chest pain,
palpitations, shortness of breath. He does sometimes feel
wheezy, but rarely needs his albuterol. Denies abd pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea or dysuria. No muscle pain, weakness or
numbness.

In the ED his VS were 100.5  HR 89  BP 120/55, RR 18, O2 98%. He
was noted to be very sleepy but easily arousible, a little
disoriented - did not know date. Extrem warm and well perfused.
He was initially started on vanco/levoflox. CXR - multifocal
atelectasis, could not exclude pneumonia. He had a head CT which
showed sinusitis, no other acute process. After returning from
radiology BP dropped to 80s/50s - he received 4L IVFs and SBP
went up only to mid 90s. A R IJ was placed (difficult) and CVP
6-8. AN LP was performed and revealed red-tinged CSF which did
not clear. He was then given acyclovir, [**Last Name (un) 2830**], + ampicillin. At
time of transfer, norepinephrine was at 0.1.

Imaging:
.
[**8-18**] CT-Head: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Opacification of the right ethmoid air cells and air-fluid
level in the
right maxillary sinus. This can be compatible with acute
sinusitis if
clinically concordant
.
[**8-18**] CXR: New R IJ CVL terminates at mid SVC. No PTX. Otherwise
unchanged CXR
.

evidence of acute infarct or hemorrhage.
.
[**8-19**] CXR:
1. New left lower base retrocardiac opacity, likely pneumonia,
given
patient's clinical findings. This finding can
