Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**6-19**] and underwent cabg x5 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on epinephrine,
neosynephrine and propofol drips. Seen by renal service for
management of HD issues. Extubated on POD #2 and off all drips.
Transferred to the floor to begin to increase his activity
level. Suffered an acute respiratory arrest on the morning of
POD #3 and reintubated and transferred back to the CSRU with
continued hypotension. Bedside echo done urgently which
confirmed cardiac arrest. ACLS protocol done and pressor
support/steroids given.Ruled out for PE by CT scan when
stabilized with suggestion of right heart failure. Bilat.
atelectasis and severely elevated PA pressures treated per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. General surgery consulted on POD #4 for GNR serratia
sepsis, and probable shock liver due to hypotension. Exploratory
lap done by general surgery on POD #5 for ? mesenteric ischemia.
ID and neurology consults done with noted probable anoxic
insult.

 CVVH, epinephrine, pitressin and milrinone added for further
support. On vancomycin, meropenem, and flagyl for coverage.
Cardioverted for Afib multiple times on amiodarone. He remained
critically ill with marginal CO/CI. Clinical nutrition consulted
as pt. could not tolerate tube feeds. Chest tubes and pacing
wires removed on POD #13/8. Flagyl stopped on [**7-3**] as C. diff.
negative. CT scan showed mediastinal /retrosternal fluid
collection,pleural effusion and loculated left
hydropneumothorax. Head CT was negative. Pericardial drain
placed and 500 cc of old blood removed.Heparin was held as
indicated. Bronchoscopy done on [**7-4**] which revealed RML and RLL
thick secretions. Swan removed and CVL changed on POD #17/12.
Re- bronchoscopied on [**7-10**] with clear right lung, and thick
secretions from LUL.

MRI and EEG done which were both consistent with severe diffuse
anoxic injury.
Renal, ID, and neuro services followed the pt. daily.
On [**7-12**],social work team consulted with family and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
regarding the pt's poor prognosis. DNR/DNI order in effect on
[**7-13**]. Comfort measures only instituted on [**7-13**]. Stroke attending
neurologist consulted on [**7-15**] for second opinion on prognosis and
confirmed extremely poor prognosis for a meaningful neurological
recovery. Family discussion had with team, and they elected to
have him extubated. Pt. expired in the CSRU at 8:08 PM on [**7-15**].
