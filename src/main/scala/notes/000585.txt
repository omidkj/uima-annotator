ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial physical exam was significant
for the patient being intubated, disheveled, with some
rigors.  Pupillary exam was normal.  Patient was in a
C-collar.  He had poor air movement bilaterally with
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes throughout.  Cardiac and
abdominal exams were unremarkable.  Toes were downgoing.  He
was unresponsive to voice.  He had no gag reflex but did have
corneal reflexes.  Gastrointestinal fellow exam in ER showed
a finding of brown stool which was heme negative; however, it
was guaiac positive per the Emergency Room physician.

INITIAL LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 31.6, near his baseline;
MCV of 67, platelets of 220; normal coagulation studies,
unremarkable chemistry panel, negative urinalysis, and serum
and urine toxicity negative for benzodiazepines.

EKG showed down sloping ST depression in 2, L, and T-wave
inversion in 3, but otherwise unremarkable.

Chest x-ray showed minimal atelectasis at left lung base,
questionable mild congestive heart failure.

There is no bowel obstruction on KUB.

Head CT was negative except for maxillary sinus mucosal
thickening.

Recent EGD [**2188-8-14**] showed Barrett's esophagus and
nodularity in duodenum.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was treated with Protonix, was
stabilized overnight, then underwent EGD.  The patient had a
large hiatal hernia with short segment of Barrett's
esophagus, ulcers in the lower third of the esophagus, fluids
in stomach.  EGD was otherwise normal to the third part of
the duodenum.  Recommendations were Protonix 40 mg
intravenous b.i.d. until on POs, Carafate one gram q.i.d.
when able, and repeat EGD in six weeks to document clearance
and support the biopsy.

By [**2189-7-16**] the patient was ready for transfer to the floor
and had been extubated.  Was having no respiratory
difficulties.  Hypokalemia was treated.  Diet was advanced to
full.  Patient had some mild abdominal pain thereafter which
was felt to be consistent with his chronic constipation which
was treated in the usual fashion with his home medications.
Patient did spike to 101.4 F degrees the evening of
[**2189-7-16**].  Sputum culture showed gram positive cocci.
Chest x-ray was unremarkable.  Urinalysis was negative with
blood cultures pending.  The patient's fevers resolved
without intervention.  He began to have guaiac-negative
stools.  His abdominal pain improved.  He was therefore felt
safe for discharge on [**2189-7-19**].

Discharge medications were not recorded by the discharging
physician but probably included his home medications and:
1.  Carafate as directed by the GI fellow, one gram q.i.d.
2.  Protonix 40 mg b.i.d.
