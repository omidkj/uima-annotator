[**2147-5-2**] CXR PA/lat: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2147-5-3**] GI bleeding study: Active, but intermittent Gi bleeding
with a source in the mid-epigastrium, probably small bowel.
First seen 70 minutes after isotope injection.

[**2147-5-4**] Small bowel enteroscopy: No evidence of blood or
stigmata of recent blood in stomach, duodenum, and visualized
jejunum to 110 cm. No obvious angioectasia.

[**2147-5-7**] CXR portable: Left PICC line seen. NGT visualized.
There is continued evidence of left pleural effusion but no
significant interval change, including no evidence for new
pneumonia or CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year-old female with history of duodenal AVMs and prior
bleed, admitted with hematochezia. Her hospital course will be
reviewed here.

1. GI bleed: She was hemodynamically stable at the time of her
admission, with Hct 35. An NG tube placement was attempted but
failed. She continued to have episodes of hematochezia on the
floor, and the GI service was consulted. A bleeding scan was
obtained on [**2147-5-3**], which revealed active but intermittent GI
bleeding with a source in the mid-epigastrium, probably small
bowel, first seen 70 minutes after isotope injection, consistent
with a slow bleed. A push enteroscopy was subsequently obtained
on [**5-4**], negative for active bleeding, stigmata of recent bleed
or angioectasias in stomach, duodenum and visualized jejunum to
110 cm. Her hematocrit drifted down, and she was transfused 1
unit of PRBCs on [**5-4**] and [**5-5**]. An attempt was made to prep
her for a colonoscopy, which she did not tolerate. An NG tube
was placed for GoLytely administration. On [**5-6**], she became
tachycardic in the setting of recurrent hematochezia, and was
transferred to the ICU for further care. After a discussion with
IR and the ICU team, the patient's family expressed their wishes
to avoid invasive therapeutic and diagnostic procedures,
including arteriography or further endoscopy. She was transfused
2 additional units of PRBCs while in the ICU (last [**5-7**]). She
was transferred back to the floor on [**2147-5-8**].

While on the floor, she had 2 further episodes of hematochezia.
Her hematocrit, however, remained stable. Once again, per the
patient and family, she is to be managed conservatively with
transfusional support as needed, no further intervention. It is
expected that she may have further episodes of hematochezia.
Please follow hematocrit, transfuse for hematocrit <28. She
remains on Protonix 40 mg daily. Hematocrit at discharged 33.

2. Hypoxemia: While in the ICU, Ms. [**Known lastname 27462**] developed new
respiratory distress and hypoxemia in the setting of
tachycardia. Her presentation was felt most consistent with
diastolic dysfunction (documented in recent echo) and probable
flash pulmonary edema, and she responded well to IV Lasix
diuresis. CXRs were negative for pneumonia. She was started on
Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID on [**5-8**] for HR control, as well as
Captopril 12.5 mg PO TID, which was titrated up. She was also
restarted on her out-patient dose of Lasix 20 mg daily on [**5-9**],
held on [**2147-5-10**] in the setting of concentrated urine and
probable mild dehydration. Of note, during her first night on
the floor, telemetry revealed intermittent bradycardia after
initiation of Metoprolol, asymptomatic. In the next 24 hours,
she had no further events, and Metoprolol was continued.

She was transitioned to Lisinopril 10 mg daily. She remains on
Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID. Please consider up-titration if her
blood pressure is persistently elevated. BP at D/C 120-160.
Please also monitor her fluid status, and consider resuming
Lasix therapy at 20 mg daily. Lasix currently remains on hold.

3. Leukocytosis: On [**5-6**], her WBC rose up to 21. An infectious
work-up at that time was remarkable for a positive U/A, with
culture eventually growing E.coli (sensitive to CTX). She was
initially placed on Levofloxacin, changed to CTX with good
response. She completed a 7-day course of Ceftriaxone on
[**2147-5-12**].

4. Nutrition: Speech and swallow was consulted, and the patient
failed a swallowing evaluation on [**2147-5-8**]. Tube feeds were
started on [**5-8**] via NG tube. Unfortunately, her [**Last Name (un) **]-intestinal
tube occluded on [**5-9**], and was replaced under fluoroscopy. That
same night, she accidentally pulled it out. A repeat swallow
evaluation was performed on [**2147-5-10**], which she passed. She was
therefore placed on a soft solids/thin liquids diet, changed to
a ground solids/thin liquids diet, on which she remains.

5. Thrombocytopenia: While in the hospital, her platelet count
was noted to be slowly drifting down to a nadir of 105. All
heparin products were held on [**5-9**]. A HIT antibody returned
negative, and heparin flushes were resumed. The exact etiology
of her platelet drop remains unclear, possibly
medication-induced, ? Ceftriaxone versus Lansoprazole. She is
now off both of these medications. Her platelet count has
remained stable over the past 5 days, up to 119 on the day of
discharge.

6. IV access: A PICC line was placed in the hospital, and
remains in place at the time of discharge for access and blood
draws. Consider removal in the next week.

7. Ppx: TEDS to both lower extremities.
