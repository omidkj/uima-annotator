Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for TIPS eval

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TIPS
Multiple Paracentesis
Colonoscopy
EGD


History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 yo F with h/o newly diagnosed cirrhosis likely
secondary to alcohol who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 3325**] for evaluation of TIPS placement in the setting of
massive ascites refractory to medical therapy. She was initially
admitted on [**4-9**] complaining of significant abdominal
distention, LE edema, and some SOB that had developed over a
period of many months without prior evaluation. She had 3
paracenteses performed during OSH course with 6L being removed
on each, peritoneal fluid studies negative for SBP X 3. Pt was
initiated on lasix 40 mg daily and spirinolactone 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]
without any improvement in abdominal girth. During
hospitalization, pt had negative hep A,B,C serologies and
negative [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial, and anti-smooth muscle
antibodies. Hospital course also complicated by rising white
count up to 17.3 without a clear source that was treated
intially with CTX and then transitioned over to Zosyn. Also had
1 episode of coffee ground emesis upon admission, Hct reportedly
stable, NGL results unknown, put on protonix gtt X 24 hrs, EGD
deferred as no further hematemesis. Given refractory ascites,
she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Of note, though
not reported the patient has a pleural effusion and arrived on
3L 02 via NC (and has history of COPD).
.
On arrival to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10, the patient reports that all day today
she has had bright red blood per rectum. She has cough which is
chronic and she notes she has had some blood in her sputum over
the past few days. She denies dizziness, chest pain and reports
her baseline shortness of breath. She denies history of GI
bleeding. She reports her abdomen feels full and is tender when
she lays on her side. Per the patient her last drink was in the
fall, though records indicate she was drinking up until her
admission to [**Hospital1 46**]. She also reports a 40 pack year history of
smoking.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68 yo F with h/o EtOH cirrhosis, COPD and HTN transferred
from OSH for further management of massive ascites and possible
TIPS placement, also with BRBPR.
.
#) EtOH cirrhosis - Patient has never been followed by a liver
doctor. Though a poor historian, ascites appeared to have
developed over the last 9 months. ETOH most likely as viral,
autoimmune causes have been ruled out at OSH. Liver ultraound
showed patent vessels.  Liver synthetic function mildly abnormal
at admission.  Patient had 18L of ascites removed at OSH and
quickly reaccumulated.  We did 2 more paracentesis on [**4-18**] and
[**4-22**] and removed 7.2L and 4L respectively (followed by albumin).
We did not start diuretics given patient's GI bleeding. Patient
was evaluated for TIPS by liver team and it was felt she would
likely benefit symptomatically from TIPS so this was preformed
[**2121-5-2**]. Patient not encephalopathic on exam while here and has
no history of encephalopathy.
.
#) GI/Vaginal Bleeding: Patient with moderate amount of maroon
blood on rectal exam and guaiac positive stool.  She also
appeared to have some vaginal bleeing.  Vaginal ultrasound was
done and showed a normal endometrium.  Flex sig was planned for
the morning of [**4-22**] but the patient had decompensated the night
before and so this was cancelled.  Per report, the patient had 1
episode of coffee ground emesis at the OSH but was not scoped
(HCT on transfer 36).  She was placed on a PPI IV BID and the
following morning she had an EGD that showed esophagitis and 4
cords of grade 1 varices.  The patient did well until the
evening of [**4-21**] the patient had coffee ground emesis, about 100
ccs.  She was given one unit of blood and her HCT stayed the
same.  The following morning the patient had more episodes of
coffee ground emesis and tube feeds were stopped and dobhoff put
on suction.  She initially had 1L of cofee ground fluid removed,
then the fluid turned into maroon color.  Repeat HCT was 26
(3pts down from previous).  Patient ordered for 2 more units of
blood, had 2 large bore IVs placed and she was transferred to
the MICU.  In the MICU she did not receive any more blood, had
no more emesis and her HCT remained stable so decision was made
not to do an EGD.  PAtient was transferred back to the floor the
next morning and her HCT remained stable, she had no more
emesis.
.
#) Anasarca: [**1-20**] both cirrhosis and malnutrition (in the setting
of poor po and etoh use): Post-pyloric dobhoff placed and
patient started on tube feeds and diet supplemented with ensure.

.
#) Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC count at OSH concerning for
infection, but patient afebrile and no evidence of infection on
any fluid culture from the OSH though patient on Zosyn.  Zosyn
was d/c'd and the patient did well for 5 days with WBC count
trending down. However, her WBC count acutely jumped from 11 to
22 (at the time she started bleeding).  She was empirically
covered with Vanco, flagyl and Ceftriaxone.  Dx p
