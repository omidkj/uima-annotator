History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 88733**] is a 72 year old gentleman who was discharged to
[**Hospital 38**] rehab yesterday after admission for c3-t1 fusion
following peds vs. MVA 1 wk ago leading to parapelgia, now
presenting with confusion and respiratory distress. This morning
at rehab he was noted to be in resp distress, with tachypnea and
sats in low 90s, not aaox3. He was given O2 at the rehab and
tachypnea resolved and sats improved to the high 90s.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was reportedly comfortable. Vitals on arrival were
97.8 (100.4 rectal) 72 145/77 16 97% 2L NC. CXR showed
increasing bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
consolidation ? atelectasis vs pneumonia. He was given vanc,
cefepime and levofloxacin for treatment of HCAP. Blood and urine
cultures were sent. He was admitted to the ICU because of
concern for partial diaphramatic paralysis from his recent
accident which could lead to respiratory distress. Vital signs
on transfer were stable.
.
On the floor, pt is aaox0. Unable to answer any medical hx
questions. Denies pain. States his breathing is a little
difficult. Otherwise answers "no" to most questions.

TECHNIQUE: Barium containing foods of various consistencies were
administered
by the speech pathologist.

FINDINGS: There is normal swallowing function. Mild-to-moderate
vallecular
pooling is noted, which is cleared with swallows of thin
liquids. There is no
laryngeal penetration or aspiration.

IMPRESSION: No laryngeal penetration or aspiration. Please see

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo gentleman with recent hemiplegia s/p peds vs MVA, s/p
c3-t1 fusion, now presenting from rehab with AMS and respiratory
distress.

Active Issues:
#. Respiratory distress/Pneumonia:
At rehab patient noted to be dyspneic. On presentation to the
ED, the patient was reportedly comfortable with minimal O2
supplementation (2-3L NC) Admission CXR demonstrated bilateral
increasing pleural effusions with bibasilar consolidations.
Bibasilar considations thought secondary to aspiration vs
hospital acquired pneumonia. Patient started on
vanc/levoquin/cefepime which was eventually tailored to
vanc/cefepime. Urine legionella negative. Patient respiratory
status improved while on treatment. In regard to his aspiration
risk, a swallow study was performed and advanced to a video
swallow study, which demonstrated normal swallowing function
without laryngeal penetration or aspiration.
Pleural effusions were thought secondary to volume overload
(patient was 14L up last admission) with possible parapneumonic
contribtion. PNA was treated. In addition patient was actively
diuresised with 5mg -10mg of IV lasix daily.
Throughout his time on the medicine floor, the patient also
received an evaluation and extensive chest PT.
At time of discharge patient was saturating >92% on RA with
improved aeration on exam.

#. AMS:
On admission, the patient was delerious, likely due to PNA,
hypoxia. Although metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities were
considered as a source of AMS, the minimal degree of the
patient's hyponatremia (130) was deemed unlikely to cause AMS.
While in the MICU, his mental status cleared upon abx, diuresis,
and chest physical therapy, and his sensorium remained clear
from his transfer to the medicine floor and onward.

#. Hypotension:
After the patient's initial diuresis in the MICU (20mg IV
lasix), his SBP decreased to the to the 80s, which however was
asymptomatic without change in MS, urine output, heart rate. BPs
stabilized overtime on their own. Hypotension was thought to be
secondary to intravascular volume depletion in setting of low
albumin state vs aut
