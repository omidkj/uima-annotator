Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2200-5-26**] 1. Mitral valve repair with a 28-mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] and
resection of P2 2. Coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending.

History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with known severe mitral regurgitation followed by
serial echocardiogram with increasing dyspnea on exertion. He
underwent a cardiac catheterization [**2200-4-22**] which revealed a 50%
LAD stenosis and an 80% second diagonal artery stenosis. The
left ventriculogram showed 4+ MR with an EF of 60%. Given the
severity of his MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 22191**] of his symptoms, he presents
surgery.

Findings
PRE-CPB: Severe mitral regurgitaion noted with what is most
likely a P2 flail leaflet. Regional wall motion looked to be
normal and EF was in the 55-60% range. NO PFO was detectable
upon color doppler analysis of inter-atrial septum.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Normal descending aorta diameter.
MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet flail. Mild mitral annular
calcification. Severe (4+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
POST-CPB: Patient was weaned off CPB on 0.6 mcg/kg min of
phenylephrine after P2 resection and mitral valve annuloplasty
and LIMA --> LAD coronary artery bypass. Wall motion was noted
to be similar to pre-bypass function. CW interrogation of miral
valve revealed a mean gradient of 6 in the setting of a
hyperdynamic ventricle and cardiac output of 8.5 L/min.
Calculated mitral valve area via pressure half-time was 2.04cm2.
Minimal mitral regurgitation was seen utilizing color doppler.
The aorta was scanned and there was no visible evidence of
dissection noted.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mild
