History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old [**Location **] male with HTN, AF on
warfarin, who presented to his [**Hospital 3390**] clinic today with cough and
SOB. He was noted to be hypoxemic to high 80s in clinic, prior
to nebs. A CXR was obtained which demonstrated diffuse nodular
opacities, ? infxn vs. Wegener's. No frank hemoptysis, but +
blood-tinged sputum. Sats improved to the low 90s after nebs.
Based on these findings and relative hypoxemia, he was referred
to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 101.4 89 165/63 28 93%RA. Looked
diaphoretic but non-toxic and comfortable. He desaturated to mid
80's on RA --> up to high 80s on 5L--> NRB 100%. Bilateral
infiltrates noted on CXR. Labs revealed a leukocytosis to 15.6
with 82% PMNs. Lactate was mildly elevated at 2.2. EKG showed
lateral ST depressions unchanged from prior. Blood cultures and
urine cultures were drawn. Received 500cc IVF and vancomycin 1g,
levofloxacin 750mg, as well as albuterol and ipratropium nebs,
and was admitted. Access: 1 20 gauge. Most recent VS: most
recent P: 98 BP: 150/70 RR: 25 O2: 100% NRB.
.
Currently, he feels well. He endorses small hemoptysis with
cough at home, as well as feeling hot, with rigors. This has
been going on since last night. ? sick contacts.

[**7-4**] CXR:

airspace
opacification that is concerning for pneumonia or Wegner's
granulomatosis
though areas of aspirated hemorrhage also remains in the

diagnosis.

[**7-7**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Mild improvement in diffuse opacification involving
the right
hemithorax, though with increased atelectatic change. Worsened
left-sided
retrocardiac opacification representing atelectasis and/or
pneumonia.
.
[**7-9**] CXR
The heart is enlarged. There is plate-like atelectasis in the
right mid lung zone. There is left lower lobe consolidation.
Endotracheal tube terminates in the thoracic inlet. Nasogastric
tube courses below the diaphragm but the tip is not seen. There
is little change since the prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o male with HTN, HLD, and reactive airways disease who
presented with severe CAP requiring intubation, now extubated
and improving from a respiratory standpoint, with resolving
delerium.
.
# Severe CAP vs. VAP; hypoxic respiratory failure: admitted for
severe community acquired pneumonia. CXR showed "diffuse
multifocal mass-like nodular airspace opacification that is
concerning for pneumonia or Wegner's granulomatosis though areas
of aspirated hemorrhage also remains in the differential
diagnosis." His (endotracheal) sputum from [**7-5**] grew
pan-sensitive enterobacter, which is of unclear significance.
The remainder of his infectious work-up was negative, including
negative urine legionella, negative blood and urine cultures.
His was maintained on levaquin/ceftriaxone/vancomycin until [**7-9**]
when he had leucocytosis and ?increased secretions. At this
point, ceftriaxone was changed to cefepime for ?VAP after
extubation on [**7-9**]. However, his overall course was more
suggestive of slow improvement rather than a hospital-acquired
superinfection. His MRSA screen was negative and he does not
have any clear MRSA risks at baseline. He completed 7 days of
levofloxacin prior to discontinuation. Patient also completed 7
days of vancomycin and cefepime from date of extubation [**7-9**].
Patient was continued on prn albuterol and ipratropium
nebulizers, but does not have clear COPD/asthma history. His
ambulatory O2 sat was > 96% on discharge.
.
# Confusion: resolved. Given acute onset and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
course, suspect ICU delirium. Of note, severe infection (though
resolving) likely played a role. Patient had one episode at
night where he became acutely agitated and pulled out his PICC
line. He required PO and IM haldol. To improve delerium,
patient's foley and rectal tube were discontinued, as was his
telemetry. He was maintained on a normal sleep wake cycle.
Patient's mental status was markedly improved and at baseline
with these interventions and with resolving infection. On
discharge, patient was AOx3 and at baseline per family.
