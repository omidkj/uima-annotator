CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: evaluate trauma

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
26 year old man with MVC
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate trauma
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 26-year-old in motor vehicle accident.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the brain without IV contrast. No prior
studies.

FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of
normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. Mild mucosal thickening is seen in
the ethmoid air cells, and circumferential mild mucosal
thickening in the left maxillary sinus. There are no fractures.
Soft tissues are normal. There is slight prominence of the
pharyngeal tissues, likely due to enlarged adenoids which can be
seen in a patient of this age.

IMPRESSION:

No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP); REPEAT, (REQUEST BY RADIOLOGIS

Reason: PROPRER IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENT

REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Proper identification of patient.

Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed and compared to the
previous films done as trauma setting on [**2172-6-3**] at 07:28
a.m.

The right upper lobe collapse which is complete now , compared
to mild atelectasis seen on the previous chest x-ray. The rest
of the right lung and the left lung are unremarkable. The right
fifth rib fracture seen on the previous chest x-ray is not
demonstrated on the current radiograph due to a different
position of the patient.

There is no pneumothorax. There is no sizeable pleural effusion.
The heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Eval. for interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
26 year old man s/p Bronch for RUL collapse
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval. for interval change
HISTORY: Status post bronch for right upper lobe collapse,
question interval change.

CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.

An ET tube is present, tip approximately 2.9 cm above the
carina. An NG tube is present, tip and side port beneath the
diaphragm.

There is hazy opacification over the right lung, with blunting
of the right costophrenic angle. There also appears to be some
alveolar opacity in the right suprahilar region. There is slight
rightward deviation of the trachea, suggesting slight rightward
volume loss. Compared with one day earlier, there has been
considerable improvement in the right-sided effusion and some
improvement in the positioning of the trachea/right-sided volume
loss. The left lung remains grossly clear, without CHF, focal
infiltrate, or effusion. Minimal atelectasis at left base. No
pneumothorax is detected on either side.

Service:
Date:  [**2172-6-5**]
Date of Birth:  [**2145-8-4**]
Sex:  M
Surgeon:  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], [**MD Number(1) 67965**]

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right upper lobe collapse,
persistent.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Rigth upper lobe collapse,
persistent.

PROCEDURE:  Flexible bronchoscopy.

INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 26 year old man who was
involved in a motor vehicle collision which resulted in
multiple right sided rib fractures.  He has had a persistent
right upper lobe collapse on several x-rays.  This collapse
has not responded to analgesia and chest physiotherapy.  He
was then presented for elective bronchoscopy.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was identified, consent was
confirmed.  He was taken to the operating room and placed
supine on the operating table.  A general endotracheal
anesthetic was administered by the anesthesiology staff.  The
flexible bronchoscope was introduced.  There were immediate,
obvious thick tenacious secretions in the right upper lobe
and right middle lobe.  These were aggressively suctioned
resulting in clearance of these airways.  The remainder of
the bronchoscopy including right lower lobe and left upper
lobes were clear.  There was no anatomic abnormality, blood,
purulence, or endobronchials lesion encountered in the airways
to
the segmental level bilaterally.  No specimens were sent. The
patient
tolerated the procedure well and remained intubated in the
operating room for planned orthopedic procedure.





Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. Orthopedics was
consulted because of his injuries. He was taken to the operating
room on [**2172-6-5**] for ORIF of his right acetabular fracture and a
flexible bronchoscopy for right upper lobe collapse (see
pertinent results). Postoperatively he was akne to the TSICU and
remained intubated for 24 hours; he was eventually weaned and
extubated and was transferred to the floor on scheduled nebs and
pulmonary toilet. He is being discharged on his home med of
Albuterol and will be given a script for Fluticasone. He will
remain on Lovenox for a total of 4 weeks per recommendation of
Orthopedics and will follow up with them in 2 weeks.

Because of his rib fractures patient had significant pain
control issues. He was initially on PCA Dilaudid which was not
effective; he was later changed to OxyContin and prn Oxycodone
for breakthrough pain which has improved his pain control. He
did require an increase in his long acting medication for better
relief.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended outpatient rehab.

Social work was consulted due to ETOH associated with his motor
vehicle crash.
