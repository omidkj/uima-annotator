History of Present Illness:
 31 y/o M with biliary atresia s/p liver [**Month/Day/Year **] at age 4
currently listed for liver/kidney [**Month/Day/Year **], ESRD on HD who was
transferred from OSH [**2135-11-12**] with fevers, tachycardia, and
abdominal pain. Patient reported diffuse abdominal pain, worse
in RUQ x 4 days that came on suddenly then radiated to right
chest. The day prior to transfer he had coffee-ground emesis and
black diarrhea. In the ED patient was tachycardic to 140-150s
with SBP 100's and spiked a fever to 102.4. Patient was
empirically started on vancomycin and zosyn. CXR demonstrated
bilateral effusions and no infiltrate. CTA torso demonstrated no
PE, but loculated ascites with mass effect, patent portal vein,
mod-large b/l pleural effusions and jejunal wall thickening of
unknown significance. Following 3L of IVFs patient remained
tachycardia and was consequently admitted to the MICU for
concern of sepsis.
.
During his MICU stay blood cultures returned positive for
klebsiella pneumoniae and consequently his HD line was removed.
Cultures were pan-sensitive consequently vanc/zosyn was narrowed
to ceftriaxone. Additional infectious work up included: negative
influenza, negative c. diff, negative SBP, negative urine
culture. Patient had no episodes of coffee ground emesis or
melena and HCT remained stable (hemoconcentrated on admission).
Tachycardia was an ongoing problem. The MICU team attempted
small boluses of fluid with only mild improvement in his HR.
Today 6 mg adenosine was given to investigate whether rhythm was
SVT but had no effect. During his admission the patient began
complaining of back pain and a MRI spine was ordered to rule out
epidural abscess prior to transfer.
.
Upon evaluation of the patient he states his abdominal pain has
completely resolved since admission. He denies any fevers,
chills, emesis or bloody bowel movements. He states his back
pain started on saturday ("after all the fluids") but has now
improved. The pain was [**4-3**] and non-localized ("my entire
back"). Patient describes difficulty ambulating due to lower
extremity edema only. No changes in his bowel movements (loose
at baseline). The patient is oriented x 3 and states he feels
much better than on admission.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted [**10-3**] and diagnosed with
H1N1, SVT responsive to adenosine, multifocal PNA treated with
vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin, possible sick euthyroid and
acute on chronic renal failure felt to be due to ATN requiring
HD and relisting for a kidney [**Month/Year (2) **].
.

CT ABD/PELVIS
1. Severely limited study due to technique and timing of
contrast, for
evaluation for pulmonary embolism. No evidence of pulmonary
embolism in the
main or primary branches of the pulmonary artery.
2. Increased intra-abdominal ascites, with loculation and mass
effect on the intra-abdominal organs. Cirrhosis. Patent portal
vein. Perisplenic varices, compatible with portal hypertension.
3. Pulmonary edema. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural
effusions with
associated atelectasis.
4. Two enlarged right internal mammary lymph nodes and right
greater than
left gynecomastia.
5. Mild jejunal wall thickening of unclear etiology. Eneteritis
is a
consideration. Some of these loops are mildly dilated but there
is not
obstruction.
6. Stable pneumobilia and mild common bile duct dilatation
status post
choledocojejunostomy.
7. Stable enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.

MRI L AND T
IMPRESSION:
1. No abnormal bone marrow signal to suggest acute fracture or
osteomyelitis.
2. Bilateral L5 spondylolysis associated with proliferative bony
changes
extending into the right posterior epidural space at L4-5 which
combines with additional degenerative changes to create severe
canal narrowing.
3. Small bilateral fluid clefts at the level of spondylolysis
without a
drainable collection. Early infection within the posterior soft
tissues
cannot be fully excluded and continued followup is recommended.
