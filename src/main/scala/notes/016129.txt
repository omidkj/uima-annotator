Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
aortic stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2134-8-30**] Aortic valve replacement (19 mm CE Magma pericardial)


History of Present Illness:
This 87 year old white with known aortic stenosis is pre-op for
knee surgery. Preop workup included an echocardiogram which
demonstrated critical aortic stenosis and a cardiac
catheterization was scheduled. This confirmed severe Aortic
stenosis with moderate mitral regurgitation also. She was
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for surgery.

Past Medical History:
Aortic stenosis
hypertension
mitral regurgitation
degenerative joint disease
chronic atrial fibrillation
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
h/o right leg deep vein thrombophlebitis
chronic venous stasis cahnge right foot
s/p right total hip arthroplasty

Pertinent Results:
IMPRESSION:
1. Dense aortic valve calcification, in keeping with known
aortic stenosis
with moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic calcification in the
thoracic aorta.
2. Dense mitral annular calcification.
3. Enlarged pulmonary arteries, most likely in keeping with
pulmonary
hypertension.
4. Tiny pulmonary nodules in the right lung as described above.
Suggest
followup in six months' time for further evaluation.
5. Nonspecific, hypodense lesions in the caudate lobe and
segment II of the
liver. If clinically indicated, these may be further
investigated with
ultrasound.
 The study and the report were reviewed by the staff
radiologist.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname 17236**]
[**Known lastname **] before bypass.
POST-BYPASS: Patient on milrinone
Moderate global RV hypokinesis.
LVEF 20%
Aortic bioprosthesis is stable and functioning well with mean
gradient of 10mm of Hg.
Thoracic aorta is intact.
Mild to Moderate mitral regurgitation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] on [**8-26**]. Preoperative workup
wascompleted including an echo that revealed severe MR. [**First Name (Titles) 9786**] [**Last Name (Titles) 84447**]n done and she was cleared for surgery. IV heparin
was begun while coumadin was held post-cath.

She underwent tissue aortic valve replacement by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**8-31**]. the mitral regurgitation was felt to be not sever enough
in the Operating [**Last Name (un) **] after aortic replacement to warrant
surgical repair. She weaned from bybass on multiple pressors
including Levophed, Milrinone, Vasopressin and Propofol drips.
The Milrinone was changed to dobutamine, her cardiovascular
status improved asnd all agents were weaned to off in 24 hours
with good hemodynamics.  She was exubated on POD 1 and remained
stable. The Coumadin was resumed for atrial fibrillation and she
was transferred to the floor.

Physical therapy worked with the patient or mobility and
strengthening.  Due to her overall physical condition she was
sent to a rehabilitation facility for further recovery prior to
return home.

Wounds were clean and dry and healing well at discharge.
Arrangements were made for out patient followup.  She will be on
Coumadin for her chronic atrial fibrillation.
