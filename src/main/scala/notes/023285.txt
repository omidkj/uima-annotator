History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with history of CAD, dCHF EF 60%, AF on
coumadin, CKD, COPD and HTN who is being transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
ERCP. Patient was in her usual state of health until yesterday
when she began feeling unwell, was having chills, abdominal pain
and nausea, and decided to go to [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital. At
AGH a RUQ U/S revealed intrahepatic biliary duct dilation and CT
abd/pel revealed an obstructing mass in the head of the
pancreas. On admission she was found to have  AST 569, ALT 255
and normal WBC. On HD 2 this increased to 27 and 4/4 bottles of
blood cultures became positive for GNR's. She had been started
on Unasyn on admission but this was changed to Zosyn after the
cultured came back (+) and she was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.

On the floor, patient is feeling better after.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. Low appetite since feburary, loss appetite and
weightloss, [**Location (un) **] L>R, back adn L hip pain.
(-) Denies cough, shortness of breath. Denies chest pain, chest
pressure, palpitations. Denies dirrhea, changes in bowel habits.

ERCP ([**2134-9-6**]): Surgical clips are noted in the gallbladder
fossa. Dilated
common bile duct with evidence of either distal narrowing or
extrinsic
compression. Biliary stent was placed. Minimal opacification of
the
remainder of the biliary tree was performed given concern for
cholangitis.

ERCP ([**2134-9-17**]): A plastic stent previously placed in the biliary
duct was found in the major papilla. A small sphincterotomy was
performed in the 12 o'clock position using a needle-knife over
previously placed plastic biliary stent. The plastic stent was
then removed with a snare and sent for cytology. Cannulation of
the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome
using a free-hand technique. A single stricture that was
approximately 1cm long was seen contained in the intra-ampullary
portion of the CBD. Two round stones ranging in size from 5 mm
to 6 mm were seen at the biliary tree. An extension
sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a
sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
The two stones and some sludge were extracted successfully using
a balloon catheter. Excellent drainage of bile and contrast was
noted. Extensive cold forceps biopsies were performed of the
ampulla for histology. It is possible that the stricture may be
due to inflammation and scarring related to stone passage,
however, this will not explain the mass seen on CT scan.  Since
the intra-ampullary stenosis was completely opened with the
sphincterotomy with excellent drainage, there was no need to
place another stent.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. E. COLI SEPSIS:  Pansensitive E coli, cultures grown from
outside hospital.  The patient was on antibiotics but had low
grade temperatures even following initial ERCP with plastic
stent placement in an area of stenosis related to a pancreatic
head mass.  She underwent a second ERCP on [**9-17**] which revealed
new gallstones in the common bile duct.  She underwent a
sphincterotomy which relived this obstruction.  Following this
procedure her LFTs increased and slowly trended downward.  A
course of ciprofloxacin was completed.

2. PANCREATIC MASS: Initial brushings with atypical cells.
Repeat brushings and biopsy from [**9-17**] showed inflammation but no
evidence of malignancy.  Given that the patient and family would
likely not pursue any further work-up should this be a cancer,
further evaluation (e.g. CT abdomen) was deferred.

3. CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CHF: Given sepsis lasix and lisinopril
initially were held.  Following reintroduction of these
medications at her home doses she became hypotensive to an SBP
of 80 and had acute renal failure with a Cr of 1.7.  She was
treated with IVF.  Eventually after holding diuretics and with 2
units of FFP on [**9-17**] she became dyspneic and had pulmonary edema,
she was given 40mg IV lasix on [**9-19**] and transitioned to her home
dose of lasix 40mg po daily on [**9-20**].  Her lisinopril was not
reintroduced given hypotension.  She also experienced morning
dyspnea on [**9-22**] and [**9-23**] for which QHS MS Contin was introduced;
this decreased the symptomatic dyspnea.

4. Atrial fibrillation: Patient with AF on coumadin. INR 2.2 on
admission, coumadin held for ERCP and restarted post ERCP.  At
discharge, INR was 1.4.

5. LOWER EXTREMITY JOINT PAINS: likely secondary to
osteoarthritis, worsened secondary to immobility as well as to
infection / fevers.  This improved with physical therapy and
with treatment of infection but the patient will require further
physical therapy upon discharge to improve mobility to the point
at which she can become independent again.  Gabapentin,
lidocaine patch and tramadol were started (allergy to tylenol
and ibuprofen) with improvement in her symptoms, in addition she
had low dose morphine for breakthrough pain.
