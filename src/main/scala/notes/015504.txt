Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
71M transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital where he was admitted
on [**8-4**] from home for fevers.  Admit Wc was 8 and there was a
question of retrocardiac infiltrate by CXR. Blood cultures grew
GPC in clusters.  Last HD was [**8-6**].

Mr. [**Known lastname **] has had L foot ulcers since [**1-23**]. He developed left
first toe gangrene.  He underwent revascularization of the left
lower extremity on [**2114-6-25**].  This included a femoral
endarterectomy and transluminal angioplasties.  His dry gangrene
has been stable and we have been allowing it to demarcate before
amputation.

CXR

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**6-26**], all of the various
tubes have
been removed. The globular cardiac silhouette is at the upper
limits of
normal in size or slightly enlarged. Some indistinctness of
pulmonary vessels raises the possibility of elevated pulmonary
venous pressure. No evidence of pleural effusion.

Specifically, no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

US

FINDINGS: The left common femoral, popliteal femoral, and
superficial femoral demonstrates normal compressibility, flow,
and augmentation without evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

The left groin superior to the superficial femoral demonstrates
a lobulated tubular 10.6 x 2.7 x 5.7 relatively hypoechoic
structure without vascularity  on Doppler evaluation. Similar
smaller hypoechoic focus was also noted in the  right groin.
These could represent lymphoceles, and if further
characterization is desired, a CT with contrast might be
beneficial.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.

2. Bilateral groin demonstrates tubular hypoechoic structures
without
vascularity as described above and may represent lymphoceles. If
further
characterization is desired, correlation with a CT is advised.

or vegetations on aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due
to suboptimal image quality. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:

Conclusions

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate left ventricular regional
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral
walls and basal to mid septum. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging
are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with regional dysfunction c/w
CAD. Moderate diastolic dysfunction. Elevated left ventricular
filling pressure. Mild valvular
