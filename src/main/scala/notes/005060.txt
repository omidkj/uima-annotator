intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13784**] is a 77 yo F w/ PMH Stage 1A Squamous Cell Lung
cancer s/p lingular sparing [**Doctor Last Name **] Lobectomy on [**2120-11-13**], COPD who
presented to [**Hospital3 628**] with shortness of breath.
Of note, she had a recent hospital admission from [**Date range (1) 13785**] for
SOB, orthopnea, and cough. At that time, proBNP was 5726. She
was treated with IV lasix and levoquin for COPD exacerbation (5
day course). A TTE was done which was notable for EF30-35% w/
mildly dilated LA, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the anterior septum and apex of the LV. She
also had 3+ MR. With the addition of lasix + Lisinopril, her
Creatinine increased to 2.0, so both were stopped on discharge.
Today, she denied CP, cough, edema. She was tachycardic with HR
120s and with O2 sats 100% on NRB, and diffuse wheezes on exam.
She was initially treated with nebs, solumedrol, levoquin. ABG
7.21/54/73. Per the notes, she was thought to be hypotensive at
the OSH as her BPs were being taken in her left arm despite a
known history of inaccurately low BP in her left arm compared to
her right arm. She was given 3600 cc NS.  She started to tire
per report so she was emergently intubated. Her proBNP was 3300.
In the ED here, her CXR was c/w CHF. She was given IV Lasix and
aspirin and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She is currently intubated and sedated.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unable to obtain as the patient is
intubated. Per son, no f/c/sweats. no diarrhea/n/v.

.
ECG: Sinus 89, LBBB - old. Nl axis/interval. Otherwise no acute
change.
.
CXR: Evidence of previous left partial pneumonectomy is seen,
with expected fluid collection, and volume loss. Right lung is
grossly clear, with background changes of emphysema and
increased pulmonary vascular markings, indicating superimposed
pulmonary edema. Endotracheal tube is in good position.
Nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, though the
sideport is only at the GE junction. No pneumothorax is
identified.
.
[**2121-3-17**] - CTA (at [**Location (un) 620**]) - per ED report - negative for PE,
otherwise stable from [**2-13**]
.
[**2121-2-13**] - Chest CT scan - postoperative appearance of the lung
with
loculated apical and basilar pleural fluid collections at the
left side.  The 15 mm long, irregulary shaped infiltrative
abnormality in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe is
unchanged. Severe diffuse centrilobular emphysema. Severe
atherosclerotic calcification involves theleft anterior
descending artery.
.
[**2121-3-18**] Echo:
Conclusions:The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
regional systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal
2/3rds of the inferior wall and inferior septum. The remaining
segments contract well. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly reduced. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely depressed given the severity of mitral
regurgitation.] Right ventricular  chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)are mildly
thickened. There is minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION:Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary
muscle dysfunction. Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2111**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be based on clinical and  echocardiographic
data.
.
[**2121-3-19**] persantine mibi:
IMPRESSION: Normal pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion
with global
hypokinesis and a low calculated LVEF of 37%.
.
[**3-19**] carotid us: IMPRESSION: Findings as stated above which
indicate bilateral 70-79% ICA stenoses
.
renal us:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal grayscale appearance of both kidneys without
hydronephrosis.
2. Parvus tardus of the right main renal and interlobar arteries
suggests possible renal artery stenosis and further evaluation
with MRA is suggested.
.
[**3-20**] stress:
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms with uninterpretable ECG for
ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 77 year-old female with a PMH of Stage 1a
Squamous Cell Lung Ca status post-partial left upper lobectomy,
COPD presenting to OSH with shortness of breath and hypoxia. The
patient was diuresed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], extubated and tranferred to
the floor on room air.
.
1. Hypoxia - The patient has a recent diagnosis of CHF and
underlying COPD. Given the fluids given at the OSH, her hypoxia
was attributed to CHF as with diuresis in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was no
longer hypoxic.  On the floor the patient denied shortness of
breath and was saturating well on room air.  She did not require
any further intervention and was comfortable and off oxygen
prior to discharge.
.
2. CHF - The patient has an EF of 40% with 2-3 + MR, and
pulmonary HTN, thus biventricular failure.  The patient was well
diuresed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and remained euvolemic on the floor without
the need for further diuresis.  She was treated with a
beta-blocker and sent home on this as well as lisinopril to
further improve her heart function.  She was closely followed by
the CHF service and was doing well at discharge.
.
3.  CAD - The patient's ECHO revealed focal akinesis/hypokinesis
which suggests the presence of CAD.  Her enzymes remained stable
and she had no telemetry events.  She had a negative stress test
and MIBI, and therefore was continued on medical management such
as a statin, beta-blocker, ace and aspirin
