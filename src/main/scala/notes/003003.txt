Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Proton Pump Inhibitors / hayfever

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Anterior STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stents x3 to left
anterior descending artery
-Cystoscopy, bilateral ureteroscopy, bilateral laser
lithotripsy, bilateral stent placement.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 62 yo male with history of CAD sp two DES to
proximal and mid LAD after positive stress test in [**2109**],
anterior STEMI in [**2112**] with late in-stent restenosis sp DES to
LAD and ostium of diagnoal, HLD, renal calculi sp bilateral
lithotripsy and ureteral stents who presents after this
procedure today with anterior STEMI.
.
Patient was in his normal state of health until he presented for
urologic procedure for treatment of bilateral renal calculi. He
was instructed to stop Plavix for his urological procedure and
has been holding this for 5 days. He did continue aspirin.
Procedure included bilateral ureteroscopy, bilateral laser
lithotripsy, bilateral ureteral stents. In PACU sp procedure
patient developed chest pain and EKG revealed anterior STEMI. He
was taken to the for cardiac cath.
.
In the cath lab, LAD stent was dilated. Procedure complicated by
dissection of the LAD. BMS were placed in the mid LAD, distal
LAD, and proximal LAD to restablish excellent flow. Patient was
hemodynamically stable during the case. Thought of
interventional cardiology is that this represents in stent
restenosis. Patient to continue on Clopidogrel indefinitely.
Given 245 ml of omnipague dye.
.
In the CCU, patient is pain free and hemodyncamically stable.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo male with CAD sp 2 DES to LAD in [**2109**], 2 DES to LAD and
Diag in [**2112**] in the setting of late instent restenosis, HLD,
Renal Calculi who presents with anterior STEMI sp urological
procedure in the setting of holding plavix.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Anterior LAD In-Stent Thrombosis: Pt was sp 2 DES to LAD in
[**2109**], 2 DES to LAD and Diag in [**2112**] in the setting of late
instent restenosis, now with instent restensis vs thrombosis
while off plavix leading to anterior STEMI now sp 3 BMS to LAD.
Procedure complicated by dissection. Pt remained CP free.
Continued integrillin for 18 hours and then transitioned to
heparin sc. The pt will be on Plavix 75 mg forever, ASA 325mg
Daily. Restarted Beta-Blocker, ACE-I. Continue Atorvastatin 80mg
Daily.
.
#. Bilateral Renal Calculi sp B lithotripsy, B ureteral stents.
Continued continuous bladder irrigation x 3 days. HCT remained
stable. Will follow up with urology s/p hospitalization.
.
# Type II Diabetes Mellitus: A1C 11.5%. Started on metformin
500mg [**Hospital1 **], diabetic Diet, Insulin Sliding Scale. The pt is to
f/u nutritionist and physician at [**Name9 (PRE) **] Clinic in the next
month.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Chronic Diastolic CHF: Post STEMI ECHO ([**5-25**]) showed preserved
EF (>55%), mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild resting outflow tract gradient. No signs of heart failure
while in house.
.
# RHYTHM: Sinus. Monitored on Tele.
.
# HTN: Restarted Beta Blocker and Lisinopril as pressure
tolerates.
.
# HLD: Continue Atorvastatin 80mg Daily.
.
# Depression: Pt continued on fluoxetine
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Full Code. Pt to f/u with [**Last Name (un) **].
