History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 81431**] is a 45 year old female with a history of EtOH
hepatitis/cirrhosis with septic shock on pressors,
aspiration/ARDS, [**Hospital **] transfer from [**Hospital 8**] hospital for CVVH
for volume overload.

She was initially admitted to [**Hospital 8**] hospital on [**2123-11-17**]
after her nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for the Homeless
found her with multiple empty vodka bottles scattered around her
apartment.  [**Name8 (MD) **] NP had seen her intoxicated in the past and did
not feel like her behavior at that time could be explained by
intoxication alone and brought her to the [**Hospital1 8**] ED. On
admission to OSH, her EtOH level was <10.  She had elevation in
her liver function tests with AST/ALT 279/66, INR 1.6, Tbili
17.4.  Ammonia was 168 on presentation. Cr 0.5 on presentation.
K 1.9, Phos 1.2 on presentation. Tylenol level was negative.

She was intially treated for acute hepatic failure and hepatic
encephalopathy.  She did not receive steriods.  She was started
on lactulose and her mental status improved.  She began to spike
fevers on [**2123-11-20**] to 101-102.  Blood cultures from [**11-19**]
eventually grew MSSA in [**1-3**] bottles and she was started on
vancomycin/cefepime. Blood cultures repeated on [**2123-11-22**] and
were negative.  A U/A from [**11-22**] grew E. coli, not yet
speciated.  With MSSA and E. coli results, vanco/cefepime
changed to zosyn.  An abdominal CT scan also obtained which
showed evidence of pancolitis and patient was started on empiric
oral vancomycin despite C diff toxin stool assays being negative
x 4.

On [**11-20**], urine output began to decline and Cr increased from
0.6 -> 1.3. Around the same time her blood pressures began to
decrease. She was initially fluid responsive but then became
refractory.  on [**11-21**], a cordis was placed. She received several
units of FFP prior to line placement due to worsening
coagulopathy and following the line placement she became hypoxic
and acutely SOB.  She was placed on BiPAP without improvement in
ABG and she was eventually intubated.  CXR at that time showed
diffuse bilateral infiltrates.  An ECHO was obtained and prelim
read showed preserved systolic function.  PA catheter placement
was attempted unsuccessfully(CVP ~20, RV 60s/20, PA 40s??/20 at
80cm, unable to wedge).  Concern for aspiration and pulmonary
edema and vent requirements rapidly increased.  Most recently on
AC with TVs of 350 cc, PEEP of 18, FiO2 of 100%.  She has a
persistent vasopressor requirement, currently on levophed 4
micrograms/min, and remains anuric with most recent Cr of 3.1.
Tbili has continued to rise to 18 and she has become
increasingly coagulopathic.

Past Medical History:
# alcoholic hepatitis/cirrhosis
# h/o aspiration pneumonia
# HTN

Intermittently estranged from her family. Homeless until 3
months ago. Now lives alone. History of heavy EtOH use. +
current tobacco, unknown amount. H/o crack cocaine use, but no
known IVDU.

KEY IMAGING:
ADMISSION CXR from [**2123-11-24**]:
There is diffuse opacification of the lungs bilaterally which is
consistent with multifocal pneumonia versus ARDS. The heart size
is mildly enlarged. The mediastinal silhouette is within normal
limits.

[**2124-11-23**] ABD US:
1. Cirrhotic liver, ascites, and splenomegaly, reflecting
chronic liver disease.
2. Non-occlusive thrombus within the main portal vein, with
extremely slow flow throughout the portal venous system. Patent
hepatic veins and hepatic artery.
3. Possible subhepatic fluid collection.

[**2124-11-25**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

[**2123-12-7**] CT TORSO w/ CONTRAST:
1. Pancolitis, likely due to C. difficile.
2. Ascites.
3. Hypodense kidneys that do not excrete contrast. According to
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
the patient is on continuous dialysis.
4. Pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion.
5. Questionable fullness of the left adrenal gland, with no
definite
nodularity. Attention should be made on the next follow-
