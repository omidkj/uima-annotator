Admission Date:  [**2130-2-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2130-3-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2055-3-27**]       Sex:  M

Service:  TCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old
male with extensive past medical history who presented to
[**Hospital6 256**] with symptoms consistent
with a left middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident
on [**2130-2-25**] treated with total parenteral alimentation
times two.  Subsequently on [**2130-2-27**] the patient
developed shortness of breath, hypoxia, rate-related ST
depressions and troponin leak, thought to be secondary to
acute decompensated nonischemic congestive heart failure.
The patient underwent echocardiogram on [**2-27**], which showed
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with overall left
ventricular systolic function severely depressed.  The
patient was thereafter sent for Dobutamine echocardiogram
which was prematurity terminated secondary to patient request
with echocardiographic finding of severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, with global hypokinesis and
inferior lateral and apical akinesis as well as frequent
mitral regurgitation, indicative of inducible ischemia and
likely multivessel coronary artery disease.

The patient is status post cardiac catheterization on [**2130-3-7**] revealing left main and two vessel cardiac disease,
moderately increased PA systolic pressures, normal wedge
pressure and a mildly decreased cardiac index.  Intervention
included percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
stenting of left main distally and left circumflex as well as
insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump.  Post
catheterization course complicated by groin hematoma and
vascular surgery was consulted to evaluate.

AVLs, V1 through V3, ST depressions in V2 through V3, old T
waves inferiorly.  Chest x-ray showed a left pleural
effusion.  Cardiac catheterization, left main coronary artery
and two vessel coronary artery disease, left main had a
distal 80% stenosis, minimally involving the ostia of the
circumflex, left anterior descending, left anterior
descending had mild luminal irregularities proximally, obtuse
marginal 1 with proximal 80% stenosis, right coronary artery
with mild luminal irregularities proximally and hazy 40 to
50% lesions in the mid portion.  Distal posterolateral vessel
branch had a tubular 80% stenosis, PA systolic pressures of

IMPRESSION:  A 74 year old male with Type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc who
is admitted to [**Hospital6 256**] with left
middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident treated with
total parenteral alimentation and then noted to have a
congestive heart failure exacerbation irreversible defects on
stress test.  The patient was taken to cardiac
catheterization and noted to have left main and two vessel
coronary artery disease status post stenting of circumflex
and left main with post catheterization course complicated by
left groin hematoma requiring vascular surgery intervention
in the Operating Room.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiac - Ischemia, as above the
patient is status post intervention on his left main and left
circumflex.  Anticoagulation with 2B3A was deferred secondary
to vascular surgical correction in the Operating Room and
decision to wait for a stable hematocrit post surgical
intervention.  The patient, however, was placed on
approximately four to five hours of 2B3A closed
catheterization.  In addition on the morning following
vascular surgery intervention, the patient was started on
Aspirin and Plavix.  During the rest of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course he was maintained on a beta blocker ACE
inhibitor and statin.  Doses of the beta blocker and ACE
inhibitor were titrated upwards pending blood pressure and
heartrate tolerance.

Pump, the patient with an ejection fraction of 25 to 30%.
The patient was given large amounts of fluid resuscitation
with his ongoing groin hematoma.  The patient, however, was
not noted to be congestive heart failure clinically or
radiographically.  Decision was made to follow the patient
and give Lasix prn.

Rhythm, the patient was noted to be in sinus rhythm in
approximately 80s to 90s.  The patient was maintained on a
Beta blocker to control rate.

Lipids, lipid panel was sent and the patient was started on
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.

Hypertension, the patient's blood pressure was moderately
well controlled while an inpatient at [**Hospital6 649**].  The patient's ACE inhibitor and beta blocker
dose were titrated upward in order to better control.

2.  Vascular - The patient with a left femoral pseudoaneurysm
status post repair in the Operating Room.  The patient was
noted to have an expanding hematoma with hemodynamic
instability post catheterization secondary to intraaortic
balloon pump insertion.  The patient received approximately 3
units of packed red blood cells and 2 to 3 liters of
intravenous fluids.  Post vascular surgical intervention,
hematoma was noted to be stable with gradual improvement.
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was placed and noted to drain
approximately 50 cc to 100 cc daily.  Vascular Surgery Team
continued to follow the patient and in regards to removal of
the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain it was stated that once drainage
falls considerably below 50 cc a day, the drain can be
pulled.

3.  Pulmonary - The patient with a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease requiring frequent nebulizer
treatments on the medical [**Hospital1 **].  The patient was not thought
to be having a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation and was continued on the nebulizer treatments
prn.  In addition, the patient was temporarily intubated for
his vascular surgical intervention and on arrival to the
Coronary Care Unit extubation was
