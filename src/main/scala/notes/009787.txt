room. He underwent
Exploratory laparotomy, Primary repair of sigmoid perforation,
and Repair of incisional hernias. Postoperatively he went to the
intensive care unit. Started on cipro/flagyl and was difficult
to wean from ventilator. On [**2147-9-30**] patient was extubated and
needed to be reintubated for low oxygen saturations. Diuretics
and nebulizers used and patient was sucessfully extubated on
[**10-3**]. He was transferred to the floor and speech and swallow
consulted and he was started on a regular diet/ground with
thickened liquids. He was reevaluated again on [**10-9**] and found
that he was safe for soft solids and thin liquids. Physical
therapy worked with him as well and found that he was too weak
to be discharged to home. Staples were removed on [**2147-10-9**] and
