Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted [**2201-4-17**] for elective minimally invasive
thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total esophagogastrectomy. He
tolerated procedure well please see operative note for detail.
After recovery in PACU he was transferred to [**Wardname 836**] for further
care. Initial postoperative CXR showed minimal Right apical ptx
and right subcutaneous emphysema.
On POD2 his chest tubes were placed to water seal and follwup
CXR showed tiny right apical pneumothorax and bibasilar linear
atelectasis and small amount of residual pneumoperitoneum.
On POD 3 he had asymtomatic bout of atrial fibrillation  up to
160's which responded to medical managment with IV lopressor.
On POD6 his right chest tube was removed and followup CXR was
unremarkable compared to prior. He also received an radiologic
evaluation of his esophagus anastomosis and emptying which
revealed no evidence of anastomotic leak status post
esophagectomy and slightly slow transit into the small bowel.
On POD7 the remaining left side chest tube was removed along
with nasogastric tube. subsequent CXR revealed stable sml apical
ptx seen in prior studies otherwise unremarkable.
