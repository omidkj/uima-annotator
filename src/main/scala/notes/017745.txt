Reason: Placement of postpyloris feeding tube

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old woman with severe tracheobronchomalacia
Placement of postpyloris feeding tube

CT NECK

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Airway obstruction. Goiter.
TECHNIQUE: Post-contrast MDCT from skull base to thoracic inlet.
FINDINGS: The thyroid gland is grossly enlarged, containing
multiple hypodense nodules and foci of calcification. The
enlargement involves particularly the thyroidal isthmus in the
left hemithyroid, which has a large retrosternal component,
extending well into the anterior mediastinum, displacing the
thoracic trachea towards the right (series 2, image 129). As a
result, there are post-brachiocephalic veins bilaterally.

Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in place at the time
of scanning. Opacification of the nasal cavities bilaterally,
and the right maxillary sinus is probably secondary to the
endotracheal intubation. No abnormally enlarged cervical lymph
nodes can be identified. Soft tissue planes are preserved within
the neck. Review of bone windows demonstrates no focal lytic or
sclerotic bony abnormalities. There are bilateral pleural
effusions, more on the left, with underlying atelectasis.

CONCLUSION: Gross retrosternal goiter on the left, displacing
the thoracic trachea, endotracheal tube. No abnormally enlarged
cervical lymph nodes. Bilateral pleural effusions with
atelectasis at the dependent portions of the lungs.

Bilat upper extrem US done on [**2157-6-23**] and found to have thrombus
at left cephalic vein @ ACF to 2cm above. Left brachial patent
w/o thrombus.
CONCLUSION: Gross retrosternal goiter on the left, displacing
the thoracic trachea, endotracheal tube. No abnormally enlarged
cervical lymph nodes. Bilateral pleural effusions with
atelectasis at the dependent portions of the lungs.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was accepted from [**Doctor Last Name 15594**] [**Hospital **] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2157-6-15**] for eval of TBM after aspiration of po's at group home
where she resides which required intubation d/t hypoxia. CT scan
at OSH revealed large goiter possibly contributing to narrowing
of trachea.
Arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated and admitted to the ICU.
Flex Bronch was performed and pt was found to have severe right
and left main stem Tracheobronchial Malacia (TBM). CT scan of
neck done and goiter did not appear to be compressing airway.
Evaluated by thoracic surgery (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**]) and felt not be
a candidiate for surgical resection and conservative treatment
was recommended.
[**2157-6-17**] Rigid Bronch was performed for controlled extubation in
OR setting for possible stent placement if extubation failed.
Extubation was successful. Remained in ICU for pul toilet.
[**2157-6-18**] Noted to be coughing w/ po's. Kept NPO and swallow eval
performed ar bedside w/ no obious aspiration. Video swallow done
- no aspiration but had great difficulty coordinating breathing
and swallowing efforts. Desat and tacycardic during swallow.
Suggest keep NPO and place post pyloric feeding tube for now and
repeat swallow eval in future (approx one week).
Continued on ceftriaxone and flagyl which was initiated at
[**Hospital3 36606**] for aspiration PNA. These ABX were d/c'd and
started on po augmentin x 7 days on [**2157-6-23**]- thru [**2157-6-30**].
Central line was d/c'd on [**2157-6-23**] after left upper swelling and
erythema was noted. Upper extrem ultrasound was done which
revealed left cephalic thrombus at ACF to 2cm above. No need for
IV anticoagulation- maintained on SQ heparin and pneumoboots.
Presently oob via [**Doctor Last Name **]- debilitated requiring rehab and ongoing
swallow eval and therapy.
