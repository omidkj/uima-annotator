53-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C diagnosed about
10 years ago, depression and anxiety presented to ED [**3-19**] with

Brief Hospital Course:
53 F with PMH Hep C cirrhosis (diagnosed 10 years ago),
depression/anxiety, presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure,
confusion, recent falls, UTI, pna, GIB (esophageal varices vs.
nasopharynx), passed away in the MICU.

Events leading up to MICU admission:
On [**3-19**], she had a traumatic NGT placement in ED. On [**3-20**] an NGT
placement was attempted to give lactulose as MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 56843**]d. Pt had OGT placed and she was not GIB then.
Lactulose was given through OGT. O2 sats dropped to almost 73%
on 2L NC with bleeding around the nose and mouth with ?
hematemesis/aspiration. Pt was placed on NRB satting at 88%,
with HR 110, RR 32, BP 110/64. Coarse resp sounds heard but no
heart sounds were heard although she had a good pulse. Code blue
was called anesthesia intubated the patient and she was
transferred to the MICU.

# Altered mental status:
The patient was admitted to the MICU in altered mental status
and after code blue. She had an extensive history of severe hep
C cirrhosis and encephalopathy. Given this substrate, UTI and
possible LLL pneumonia, this would likely explain her decline in
mental status. Her UTI and pna were treated with Zosyn and Vanc.
Her cirrhosis care included rifaximin, lactulose to attain [**2-16**]
BMs per day. Liver team was following. TSH on admission was 23,
and levothyroxine was increased to 150 mcg per day after
adjusting thyroid function labs for sick euthyroid. Her
psychiatry medications were held inhouse. After her vital signs
had stabilized, she was started on ritalin to help with a
possible depressive component (the patient had an extensive
psychiatric history).

Although her vitals, lytes, acid-base status, oxygenation status
were all recovered to baseline, she never woke up and regained
normal mental status again. She was made CMO and passed away
shortly after withdrawing care.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure:
Her hypoxemia was likely due to MRSA aspiration pneumonia. She
was very short of breath on 15L rebreather and 5L nc with sats
89-95%. She was intubated on PS 10/5 Fi02 100% Rate 26, and was
started on ARDS ventilation [**2198-3-21**]. She was aggressively
diuresed, improved in respiratory status, moved to CPAP w/ PS
support and was tolerating it well. She completed a 10 day
course on Vancomycin and Zosyn on [**2200-3-28**], with one sputum cx
positive for MRSA.

Differential for her hypoxia was aspiration pneumonia,
hepatopulmonary syndrome, pulmonary AVMs, aspiration, pulmonary
edema from CHF exacerbation. She had TTE with bubble study to
assess for shunt for workup for hepatopulmonary syndrome, and
TTE showed LVEF 55%, small secundum ASD with bidirectional flow.
Decision was made not to perform perfusion scan of brain and
kidneys (using technetium-microalbumin) to assess for pulmonary
AVMs, since etiology of hypoxia was most likely aspiration.

# Sepsis from UTI and pneumonia:
Etiology was likely secondary to sepsis from both UTI and LLL
PNA. UTI grew pan sensitive Ecoli. She was aggressively
resuscitated with IVF and was on levophed and vasopressin for a
few days before she was weaned with stable vitals. She failed
her [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test and was started on hydrocort and fludrocort.

Her WBC increased from 25 to 31 before she had been started on
steroids. Her pancreatic enzymes were elevated. Differential
included fungemia, Cdiff, leukemoid reaction, line infection,
cholangitis, sinusitis, malignancy. US Abdomen with Doppler
showed no bile duct dilation (0.62 cm) from gallstone or sludge
obstruction, and pt was s/p CCY. Fungal blood culture was
negative. Stool was negative for Cdiff x4, and toxin A was
negative. Due to patient's tenuous clinical status, concern for
anticoagulation, baseline clinical status, LP was not performed.
She was started on Flagyl for presumptive Cdiff although
multiple testing was negative. Ceftriaxone was stopped after 1
day for lack of source. For possible line infection, her line
was re-sited from LSC to RSC [**3-31**]. At this point, she had
already completed a 10 day course of Vanco/Zosyn.

# GIB (nasopharyngeal vs esophageal):
NG lavage performed was clear, patient had possible esophageal
GIB with a 7 point Hct drop from baseline 42 from [**5-20**], b
