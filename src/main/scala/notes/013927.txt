Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-21**] Right Craniectomy.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 34 year old right handed man with ahistory of HTN who
was transferred
from an outside hospital with L MCA stroke.

He initially presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with right sided weakness
and a headache. Initial head CT was normal and LP was performed
which showed elevated protein of >200 he was then admitted to
the floor.  He had MRI which was reportedly negative for stroke
and his R sided weakness appeared to have resolved. He later was
found to have a left hemiplegia with right eye deviation and
dysarthria.  Repeat head CT showed dense R MCA infarfct with
subsequent MRI showing acute infarct of R MCA territory.
Telephone discussion with a [**Hospital1 18**] stroke fellow (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22158**] to
the decision to give the patient IVtPA around 6:15pm. He was
then then med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation/treatment.

Per patient, he awoke this morning with HA and visual field
defect with R side weakness.  He reports that the vision deficit
and weakness has lessened but he still has pressure like
headache over the R temple.

He denies any recent chest pain, racing heart, fever/chills,
cough, N/V/D, abdominal pain and/or injury/falls.

Neuro:
Mental status: Mildly sleepy but eyes open spontaneously.
Orientation: Oriented to person, [**Hospital3 **] Hospital but thinks
its [**2107-4-23**].  Knows [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 17812**] [**Last Name (un) 2753**] is the president.
Language: Speech fluent with intact repetition.  Mildly slow

latency and mild/moderate dysarthria.

Cranial Nerves:
I: Not tested
II: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 3 to 2 mm
bilaterally. ? L field cut/neglect.
III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements intact bilaterally.
V, VII: L facial droop although does not cooperate when asked to
show me his teeth or smile.

Motor: Normal bulk and tone bilaterally. No abnormal movements,
tremors. Appears to have near full strength of RUE but R IP [**3-27**].

LUE is plegic with some extensor posturing to noxious stim and
triple flexion of LLE with noxious stim.

Sensation: Appears intact on R but neglects the L.  When
touching
both sides, he reports only R and when touching the L side, he
still reports R side.

Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac

Toes downgoing on R but up on L.

On Discharge:
On the day of discharge he was alert and attentive to events in
the room. He was non-verbal but said his last name once to the
nurse on the morning of discharge. He will show finger on the
right, or a thumb to command. He did not exhibit gaze
preference. Pupils were symmetrically reactive. His eye
movements were conjugate, full. Face shows asymmetry with left
facial droop. Tone in flaccid on the left and there is no
movement. He spontaneous and puposively moves the right, which
is antigravity and likely full strength (poor effort on strength
exam and not always following commands). Relexes were coming up
on the left prior to discharge. his left great toe goes up.

Pertinent Results:
[**3-20**] Brain perfusion - 1. Large right MCA territory infarct with
no evidence of hemorrhage.
2. The mid right M1 segment is occluded with extension to M2
branches.
3. Irregularity along the posteromedial wall of the proximal
right internal carotid artery with surrounding increased
attenuation may represent a focal dissection or, less likely, an
ulcerated plaque. This may have been a source of embolus.
4. Symmetric abnormality on the MTT, CBV and CBF maps.

[**3-20**] CT head/neck - 1. Large right MCA territory infarct with no
evidence of hemorrhage.
2. The mid right M1 segment is occluded with extension to M2
branches.
3. Irregularity along the posteromedial wall of the proximal
right internal carotid artery with surrounding increased
attenuation may represent a focal dissection or, less likely, an
ulcerated plaque. This may have been a source of embolus.
4. Symmetric abnormality on the MTT, CBV and CBF maps.

[**3-21**] Ct head - 1. The previously hypodense right lentiform
nucleus has interval increase in attenuation to now hyperdense,
with the affected area measuring 3.4 x 1.4 cm.  Similar increase
of attenuation is also noted in the right periventricular white
matter. While this could represent retained contrast from the
CTA/CTP
study five hours ago, interval hemorrhagic conversion cannot be
excluded.
2. Persistent mass effect with near complete effacement of the
right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], but no gross midline shift. No developing
hydrocephalus.
3. No evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraventricular
hemorrhagic
extension.

[**3-21**] Brain MRI - Continued maturation of large right MCA
territory infarction with hemorrhagic transformation within the
right putamen. While this examination did not include an MR
angiogram, there is suggestion of interval recanalization of the
right M1 segment which has a probable flow void.

[**3-21**] CT Head - Interval increase in the hemorrhage within the
known large right MCA territory infarct, with increased mass
effect and leftward shift of midline structures and mild uncal
henriation. No evidence of transtentorial herniation.

[**3-21**] CXR - Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. ET tube is in
standard position. The tip is 2.9 cm above the carina. NG tube
tip is in the stomach, the side port is just distal to the GE
junction. Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is mild vascular
congestion.
Right lower lobe atelectasis has improved. Left perihilar and
left lower lobe atelectases are increasing.

[**3-22**] Ct head - 1. Interval right hemicraniectomy. Mildly
decreased leftward shift, from 13 mm to now 10 mm. Unchanged
right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] effacement and mass effect.
3. Similar large ill-defined hemorrhagic focus centered at the
right basal
ganglia, with extensive hypodensity along the right MCA
distribution, may
relate to edema, ischemia or post-surgical changes.
4. Unchanged small intraventricular hemorrhage in the right
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].

CT Head [**2108-3-24**]
FINDINGS: Overall, there is no significant interval change.
There is a large parenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal
lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect on the
right lateral ventricle. There is a stable 8-mm leftward shift
of midline structures, and similar right transgaleal brain
herniation. There is a stable small amount of intraventricular
hemorrhage seen layering in bilateral posterior horns. There is
persistent air and blood superficial to the dural flap and
similar appearance of the subcutaneous hematoma. There is no
evidence of u
