Imaging:
CT Head [**6-22**]:
FINDINGS: There is a round-ovoid hyperdense mass in the right
cerebral
hemisphere, measuring 24 x 30 mm, 2:16, with a significant
amount of vasogenic edema, and enhancement of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
of the right lateral ventricle. There is shift of midline
structures 4 mm.  There is no acute hemorrhage, or large acute
territorial infarction. No blood in the ventricles. The
visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells appear normal. There is no fracture seen.
IMPRESSION:
Hyperdense round mass in the right cereberal hemisphere, with
significant
amount of vasogenic edema, concerning for metastasis. 4 mm shift
of midline structures.

MRI Head [**6-23**]:
FINDINGS: There is diffuse edema identified in the right
parietooccipital
region extending from the periatrial right region. Mass effect
is seen on the right lateral ventricle without midline shift.
Within the area of edema there is heterogenous T2 abnormality
seen measuring approximately 3 cm, which demonstrates
enhancement following gadolinium administration. There is also
subtle subependymal enhancement seen along the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the right lateral ventricle. There are no other foci of abnormal
enhancement seen within the brain. There is no hydrocephalus
identified.
IMPRESSION: Right periatrial approximately 3 cm enhancing mass
with extensive surrounding edema. The mass also demonstrates
subtle subependymal enhancement along the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
right lateral ventricle. Chronic blood products are seen within
the mass. The differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, glioma
or metastatic disease. Given patient's history of lung cancer,
metastasis should be considered, but the appearances are not
typical.

CT Torso [**6-23**]:
CT TORSO: Prior to administration of IV contrast, helical
imaging was
performed through the level of the abdomen. Subsequently, after
uneventful
administration of 100 mL of Visipaque, helical imaging was
performed from the thoracic inlet through the pubic symphysis.
Three-minute delayed imaging was performed at the level of the
abdomen. Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared. Oral
contrast was also administered.
COMPARISON: CT chest [**2114-6-20**], CT abdomen [**2109-12-11**].
MRI
abdomen, [**2108-4-10**].
CT CHEST:
Patient is status post prior right upper lobectomy, unchanged
since
examination from three days prior. A region of ground-glass
opacity in the
superior segment of the right lower lobe (3:11) appears
unchanged measuring 9 mm. There is an unchanged 3-mm nodule in
the left base (3:48). There are stable-appearing multiple
bilateral pleural plaques which are consistent with the
patient's history of asbestos exposure. There is no significant
axillary lymphadenopathy. There are scattered non-pathologically
enlarged mediastinal nodes, unchanged. There is no hilar
adenopathy. There is calcification of the aortic arch without
evidence for aneurysm or dissection. There is coronary artery
vascular calcification. No pericardial effusion. There are no
pleural effusions. The partially visualized lobes of the thyroid
appear normal.
CT ABDOMEN:
The spleen appears normal apart from an incidentally noted
splenule (3:59). The right and left adrenals appear
unremarkable. The pancreas is slightly fatty replaced but
appears otherwise normal. The gallbladder is unremarkable
without stones. In segment VII of the liver is a predominantly
hypodense mass measuring 3 x 2.2 cm with peripheral area of
enhancement consistent with prior diagnosis of a hemangioma
within the liver. Segment sVI small hemangioma is unchanged.
Segment II hemangioma seen in [**2108**] is not apparent today. There
are multiple smaller hypodensities throughout the liver, too
small to fully characterize but appear unchanged. No new masses
are identified in the liver. The kidneys enhance and excrete
contrast symmetrically. There is no hydronephrosis. There is a
hypodensity in the interpolar region of the right kidney (3:56),
too small to characterize. Left renal size has decreased since
[**2108**] from 10.9 cm SI to 9.2 cm SI and there is slight cortical
thinning and delayed enhancement compared to the right. There is
narrowing at the iorigin of the left renal artery with calcified
plaque and slight post-stenotic dilation that likely reflects
high-grade left renal artery stenosis, though it is not
optimally evaluated on this non- angiographic study. The
abdominal aorta is densely calcified with calcific and non-
calcific atheromatous plaque, but no aneurysm. Celiac artery
origin narrowing appears mild There are scattered non-
pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes. No
free air or free fluid is seen in the abdomen. Stomach and
abdominal loops of small and large bowel appear grossly normal.

CT PELVIS:
The bladder is unremarkable. Patient is status post
prostatectomy with
surgical clips in the low pelvis. The rectum is normal; however,
there is
sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis. Remaining pelvic
loops of small and large bowel appear normal. There is no free
air or free fluid in the pelvis. There are scattered mesenteric
nodes but none are pathologically enlarged. No inguinal
lymphadenopathy. There is extensive atherosclerosis with
apparent moderate to high grade narrowing of the left common
iliac artery at its origin and similarly at the origin of the
left external iliac artery. There is also moderate-highgrade
narrowing in the mid right external iliac artery. Assessment is
not optimal on this non- angiographic study.
BONE WINDOWS: Patient is status post laminectomy from L4 through
L5 with
nonunion of the posterior elements of the sacrum, unchanged
since [**2108**]. No
suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions are
