Pertinent Results:
CTA [**8-13**] Overall, no change with re-demonstration of focal wall
thickening
along the left/anterior aortic arch between the origins of the
left common
carotid artery and left subclavian artery, with a broad-based
outpouching into it. Given its broad base, and lack of adjacent
mediastinal hematoma or interval change, we favor the etiology
as subtle penetrating ulcer, but give the history of trauma,
penetrating ulcer cannot be excluded or distinguished
by imaging.

MRA [**8-12**] 1. Shallow, wide-necked abnormality along the
anterolateral wall of the aortic arch with a maximum depth of
approximately 0.3 cm and a wide neck extending over 0.8 cm. This
could represent either a penetrating ulcer or a tiny traumatic
pseudoaneurysm. Follow up CTA including non-contrast CT images
is recommended as described above.
2. Atelectasis in the left lung.

CT Torso [**8-11**] 1. Contrast-filled small focal outpouching of the
aortic arch just proximal to the takeoff of the left subclavian
is concerning for tiny pseudoaneurysm.  There is no evidence for
contrast extravasation or significant mediastinal hematoma.
2. Rib fractures of the first, second and sixth ribs on the
left, with small area of pulmonary contusion and possible
pneumatocele in the region of the sixth rib fracture. No large
pneumothorax is identified.
3. No intra-abdominal injury.
4. Hypodense cyst wtihin the right kidney for which ultrasound
is recommended for further evaluation.
5. Hepatic steatosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the trauma ICU and started on an
esmolol drip for blood pressure control.  The [**Month/Day (4) **]
surgery teams and vascular surgery teams were consulted.  They
decided in conjunction that the patient was appropriate for
medical management with good blood pressure control and close
follow-up with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] surgeon, and vascular
surgeons.  The esmolol was d/c'ed and he was started on a PO
regimen of betablocker which he tolerated well.
