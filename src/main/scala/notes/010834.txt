.
Endotracheal tube seen with tip approximately 4 cm above the
carina.
Nasogastric tube seen coursing over the stomach, the tip is
excluded from the image.  Right-sided central venous line seen
with tip in the region of the junction of the SVC and
brachiocephalic vein.  Cardiac silhouette appears enlarged.
Diffusely increased interstitial markings are seen consistent
with CHF.  Fluid seen within the minor fissure.  Likely
bilateral pleural effusions are noted, although the left
costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Endotracheal tube with tip approximately 4 cm above the
carina.

transferred from OSH intubated with cyanosis and hypotension.
Now deceased.
.
Brief hospital course.  Ms. [**Known lastname 57141**] was transferred from the ED
to the MICU.  On arrival, her pupils were fixed and dilated.  We
could not palpate a radial pulse.  We could not obtain a blood
pressure with the manual cuff but fem pulse palpable so SBP
likely in the 60s.  We continued her on levophed and dopamine
and bolused her with 1 L NS.  We regained her blood pressure at
126 systolic briefly but she became bradycardic and eventually
had PEA.

[**Location (un) 511**] Organ Bank was called.
