STUDIES
[**2-26**] TTE: No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20
cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricle
is not well-visualized. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is
seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection. Probably preserved left
ventricular systolic function without significant valvular
regurgitation.

[**2-26**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with slight A-V conduction delay.
Consider left atrial abnormality. Delayed R wave progression.
Modest T wave inversion in lead V2. Findings are non-specific
but clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

[**2-26**] CXR: 1. Massive cardiomegaly. Small left pleural effusion.
2. Mediastinal widening could represent adenopathy, pulmonary
arterial
enlargement. 2. ET tube 5.8 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is
not identified.

[**2-26**] LENIS: Limited exam without evidence of DVT.

[**2-27**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube and the right-sided
central venous access line are unchanged. There is minimal
increase in extent of the pre-existing left-sided pleural
effusion and the subsequent retrocardiac atelectasis. In the
well-ventilated areas of the lung parenchyma, no focal
parenchymal opacities have newly occurred. Overall, the diffuse
widening of the mediastinum is unchanged.

[**2-28**]: Single bedside AP examination labeled "semi-supine at
0850" is compared with the limited bedside views (labeled "line
placement") obtained the previous day, as well as a study of
[**2182-2-26**]. Once again, the study is limited due to patient habitus
and radiographic technique; however, allowing for this, there
has been marked improvement in both cardiomegaly and apparent
superior mediastinal widening since the initial study. There is
now only smooth prominence of the right paratracheal soft
tissues, borderline LV enlargement and no pulmonary vascular
congestion or significant pleural effusion. No focal airspace
process is seen.
