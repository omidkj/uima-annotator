Artery Bypass Grafting(left internal mammary to left anterior
descending, vein grafts to obtuse marginal and posterior
descending artery)

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58-year-old man who 7 years ago underwent
repair of type A aortic dissection; however, it turned out to be
a chronic dissection. The aneurysm was repaired, and the aortic
valve was resuspended. He was lost to follow-up. He presented
with congestive heart failure, moderate aortic insufficiency,
ejection fraction of 30%, and severe 3-vessel coronary artery
disease. He has elected to proceed with aortic valve replacement
and coronary bypass grafting.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval effusions/atelectasis

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old man s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval effusions/atelectasis
INDICATION: 50-year-old male status post CABG. Evaluate for
effusion/atelectasis.

COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to [**2167-9-17**].

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral views of the chest.

FINDINGS: Since the prior study, the endotracheal tube tube,
Swan-Ganz catheter, and a nasogastric tube have been removed.
The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There is no evidence of
congestive heart failure. There are mild residual bilateral
pleural effusions. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The
cardiac silhouette appears enlarged when compared to the
preoperative radiograph and the possibility of pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded. There is also an unusual contour of
the right cardiac border, which could be postoperative, but the
possibility of a mediastinal hematoma cannot be completely
excluded.

Otherwise there is marked improvement of left bibasilar
atelectasis.

IMPRESSION:

1. Marked improvement of bilateral bibasilar atelectasis.

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

3. Large cardiac silhouette and prominence of the right cardiac
border. Although this could be all postoperative, the
possibility of pericardial effusion or mediastinal hematoma
cannot be excluded on the basis of this study.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

Poor echo windows in the upper esophageal and transgastirc probe
position.
Cardiology consult
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in
the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary veins identified
and enter the
left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No spontaneous
echo contrast
in the body of the RA. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the
RA. The IVC is
normal in diameter with appropriate phasic respirator variation.

obtained from 2D
images. Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV cavity.
