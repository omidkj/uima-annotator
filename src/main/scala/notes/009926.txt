History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14738**] is a 38 yo M with h/o HIV/AIDS off HAART [**2-5**] non
compliance (CD4 6, [**2156-9-6**]), HCV c/b cirrhosis s/p IFN, HSV 2,
anal condylomas/CIS and IVDA (cocaine, heroin) who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] with cerebral edema
after presenting with R sided HA.  He reported that he had a
right sided headache, throbbing quality,without radiation and
without changes in vision, difficulty walking, or loss of
sensation.  He also reported about 2 weeks of fevers and sweats,
unsure how long he had the headache.  He thinks the headache is
worse with positional changes, worst
sitting up. He also did endorse a cough productive of sputum
which hasbeen ongoing for "a while".  He does report that his
breathing has been hard for a long time and that his chest hurts
centrally
when he breathes deeply.

MRI brain at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**9-7**]) showed multifocal ring-enhancing
lesions involving the right basal ganglia and left frontal lobe
c/w toxo vs abscesses vs lymphoma. He did not require steroids
for cerebral edema and per Neuro service, no concern for
herniation or edema currently. Initial CXR showed bilateral hazy
and streaky opacities in the lungs c/w an atypical infectious
process.

Blood cultures ([**9-6**]) grew gram + rods in [**1-5**] bottles,
cryptococcal serum Ag negative, and Toxo IgG positive, IgM
negative. ID was consulted and recommended r/o TB; pt was
started on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] ([**9-7**]) for possible brain abscesses and
Pyrimethamine, Sulfadiazine and Leucovorin ([**9-7**]) for possible
Toxo. TTE on [**9-8**] showed no vegetations and preserved BIV
funciton. On [**9-9**] pt pulled his subclavian line and triggered for
tachypnea, was placed on non-rebreather and transferred to the
SICU. CTPA was negative for PE, infiltrate or pneumothorax, but
did show mediastinal and hilar LAD. Pt improved clinically and
is currently on RA without significant intervention.

On transfer, the patient is complaining of pain all over his
body and requesting morphine. He also endorses some mild
abdominal pain with diarrhea of unclear duration.

Imaging:
MRI head w/ and w/o contrast [**2156-9-13**]
FINDINGS:  Centered in the right basal ganglia is a 1.7 x 1.7 x
1.7 cm
rim-enhancing lesion.  Note is made of central abnormally slow
diffusion,
though the area of slowed-diffusion does not span the entirety
of the
non-enhancing component of the lesion.  There is extensive
surrounding T2 and FLAIR signal hyperintensity that results in
mass effect with partial effacement of the right lateral
ventricle, as well as left to right deviation of normally
midline structures by approximately 3 mm.  In addition, there is
abnormal mass effect upon the third ventricle.  A second lesion,
with similar signal characteristics is also present in the left
frontal lobe (series 13, image 20) with the enhancing rim
measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm.  This lesion demonstrates a thicker,
more nodular component of enhancement superolaterally. There is
no other abnormal focus of enhancement.  Gradient echo images
reveal no abnormal susceptibility to suggest intracranial
hemorrhage.  There is moderate amount of fluid and mucosal
thickening in the ethmoid air cells bilaterally and along the
right frontal sinus.  Principal intracranial flow voids are
normal.  Aside from the enhancing lesions already described,
there is no other abnormally slow focus of diffusion.
IMPRESSION:  Multifocal ring-enhancing lesions, involving the
right basal
ganglia and left frontal lobe as above.  The location of these
lesions, as
well as the relatively small areas of slow diffusion relative to
the lesion c
