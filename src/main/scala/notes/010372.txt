HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year-old
male with a past medical history significant for alcohol
abuse and history of deep venous thrombosis on Coumadin who
was struck by a car when walking out of a bar on the day of
admission.  In the Emergency Room x-rays showed a comminuted
fracture more distal along the humerus.  In addition the
patient had a fracture of the proximal left tibia and fibula.
ON admission the patient had an INR of 2.3 and alcohol level
of 215.  CT scan of the head, abdomen and pelvis showed no
acute injury or hemorrhage.  On the day of admission the
patient was brought to the Operating Room and underwent open
reduction and internal fixation of the tibial fracture with
fracture.  The patient was brought back to the Operating Room
on hospital day number four for open reduction with rod of
the left humerus.  Postoperatively the patient remained
confused, agitated and was hypertensive, tachycardic and
diaphoretic.  The patient was felt to be in alcohol withdraw
and received Ativan.  The patient was then electively
intubated for airway protection and transferred to the MICU.

MICROBIOLOGY:  Blood cultures drawn [**2101-1-5**] through [**2101-1-18**]
show no growth.  Urine cultures [**2101-1-1**] through [**2101-1-18**] show

mycobacteria.  Wound culture of left elbow abrasion [**2101-1-9**]
shows no growth.  Groin catheter tip [**2101-1-12**] shows no
growth.  Pleural fluid culture [**2101-1-11**] shows no growth.
Sputum cultures [**2101-1-5**] through [**2101-1-12**] showed moderate
growth of Serratia marcescens.  Bronchoalveolar lavage of
left upper lobe [**2101-1-14**] showed scarce growth of
oropharyngeal flora.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Head CT [**2101-1-12**] no
evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  CT of pelvis no
evidence of acute injury, small hiatal hernia, left iliac
artery mural thrombus calcification, luminal narrowing and
ulcerated plaques.  CT of the abdomen with no acute injury.
Left shoulder x-ray, comminuted fracture left surgical
humeral neck fracture of the proximal left humeral diaphysis.
Femur x-ray comminuted of the proximal left tibia and fibula
with medial displacement of the fracture fragment.
Ultrasound of the lower extremities, extensive thrombus
within the left superficial femoral vein.  No right sided
thrombus.  Chest CT [**2101-1-7**] no evidence of pulmonary
embolus, right lower lobe consolidation and pulmonary
consolidation of the left lower lobe with fossae of
consolidation in the upper lobes bilaterally, emphysematous
changes in both lungs.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES PRIOR TO DISCHARGE:  CT of head [**2101-1-19**]
no evidence of  hemorrhage.  No evidence of C spine fracture.
Bilateral mastoid sinus opacification probably inflammatory
in nature.  Cyst at the floor of the maxillary sinus with a
sclerotic margin probably a benign process, may represent an
otogenic lesion.  Chest x-ray [**2101-1-24**] persistent bilateral
retrocardiac consolidation persistent rounded opacity in the
left inferior hilum, diffuse linear opacity with areas of
tram tracking and peribronchial cuffing suggestive of
bronchiectasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 70 year-old male with
alcohol abuse and a history of deep venous thrombosis who was
admitted after pedestrian motor vehicle accident.  The
patient was brought to the Operating Room for left tibial
open reduction and internal fixation and repair of left
humerus fracture.  Postoperatively course was complicated by
alcohol withdraw and the patient was transferred to the
Medical Service.

1.  Pulmonary:  Postoperatively, the patient was found to be
agitated, hypertensive, tachycardic and diaphoretic and felt
to be in alcohol withdrawl.  The patient received Ativan and
was electively intubated for airway protection and
transferred to the MICU Service.  In the MICU the patient
became febrile to 102.4 with sputum culture growing Serratia.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral pneumonia and the patient was
started on Clindamycin and Levaquin.  The patient
subsequently developed a diffuse erythematous rash and
Clindamycin was discontinued and the patient was started on
Flagyl.  The rash, however, remained unchanged and Levaquin
was discontinued and the patient was started on Ceftriaxone.
The rash persisted and became more diffuse and Ceftriaxone
was discontinued and the patient was started on Gentamycin.
As the patient continued to be febrile Vancomycin was
started.  The patient was treated with a fourteen day course
of antibiotics with subsequent improvement in the rash.  Due
to persistent fevers, the patient underwent right pleural
thoracentesis.  Pleural fluid had 270 white blood cells with
53% polys and 6850 red blood cells.  Pleural fluid culture
showed no growth.

The patient was extubated on hospital day number thirteen,
but failed extubation and was reintubated.  The patient self
extubated himself on hospital day number sixteen.  The
patient maintained oxygen saturation of 95% on 4 liters nasal
cannula and the patient was transferred to the floor.  On the
floor the patient required frequent suctioning and 100%
nonrebreather to maintain adequate oxygen saturation.  In
addition, the patient remained febrile with temperature to
101.6 and the patient was transferred back to the MICU.
Arterial blood gases done at that time showed a pH of 7.46,
PCO2 42, and PO2 of 83 on 100% nonrebreather.  Repeat chest
x-ray showed evidence of congestive heart failure and the
patient was diuresed over 5 liters with improvement in oxygen
saturation.  The patient remained afebrile for the seven days
prior to discharge and maintained adequate oxygenation on
nasal cannula O2 on the day of discharge.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with a history of
hypertension with no known coronary artery disease.  The
patient developed transient hypotension on hospital day
number seven requiring a short course of Norepinephrine.
Hypotension occurred in the setting of respiratory
decompensation and hypoxia.  After transfer to the floor the
patient developed increasing O2 requirements.  On hospital
day eighteen chest x-ray done showed evidence of congestiv
