Chief Complaint:
Allogenic Stem Cell Transplant

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year old male with history of Myelofibrosis,
diagnosed in the last year admitted today for allogenic stem
cell transplant.  He initially presented to his PCP with fatigue
and lower extremity swelling.  Ultrasound was negative for DVT.
Cardiac work-u normal.  He was noted to be anemic on lab work
and have splenomegally on exam.  He was referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 402**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation.  Bone marrow biopsy at that time was
suggestive of myelofibrosis.  He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**], under
the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for evaluation.  Pathology reviewed his
BM bx and agreed with diagnosis of myelofibrosis.  He has had
continued fatigue with need for frequent naps.  He has a
hematocrit baseline ~30-31 and platelet baseline 150.  He has
not been transfusion dependent.  He is admitted today for allo
stem cell transplant.  On review of symptoms, he notes a rash on

[**2151-2-11**] Abdomninal U/S - 1. There is small amount of ascites and
a small right pleural effusion. 2. Gallbladder wall thickening
and pericholecystic fluid is likely secondary to the patient's
underlying disease process and ascites. However, if there is
clinical concern for cholecystitis, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] scan (nuclear
medicine) should be considered. 3. Severe splenomegaly.

[**2151-2-19**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis - 1. No evidence of
retroperitoneal bleed. 2. Massive splenomegaly. 3. Diffusely
mottled appearance of the bones, consistent with the history of
MDS/myelofibrosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year old gentleman with history Myelofibrosis
who had a long and complicated hospital course including a
failed allogenic stem cell transplant from his brother and then
a failed double cord transplant on [**4-21**]. He expired on [**2151-5-20**]
due to sepsis.

# Myelofibrosis s/p Failed Allo Stem Cell Transplant s/p Double
Cord Transplant -
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for allogenic stem cell transplant for
treatment of his myelofibrosis.  On admission, he had a tunneled
catheter placed by interventional radiology.  He received
ablative therapy with Fludarabine, ATG and Busulfan.  He
recieved his stem cell transplant without complication.
Prophylactic acyclovir, fluconazole and cipro were started per
protocol as well as cyclosporine.  On day +34, patient's
chimerism results returned 45% donor cells despite an ANC of 50.
He was then initiated on splenic radiation therapy on [**3-19**] in
the hope of aiding engraftment. The patient's ANC did improve on
[**3-27**] to a peak of 198. After transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-19**], the
patient was given a 2 cord stem cell transplant on [**4-21**] without
complication, while intubated for fluid overload.  Due to renal
toxicity of cyclosporine, patient was maintained on IV
methylprednisolone [**Hospital1 **] dosing in addition to his mycophenolate
mofetil. Mr. [**Known lastname 84821**] hospital course was complicated by GI bleed,
acute renal failure, and neutropenic fever (see below).  He
ultimately died from spesis with DIC.

# Neutropenic fever/sepsis:
The patient experienced several episodes of neutropenic fever,
first on [**2-20**] at which time he was placed on Cefepime and
Vancomycin. Acyclovir was initiated at the time of admission,
but was held when his Cr rose above 1.5. The patient's fever
resolved and he did not experience any further episodes until
spiking to 103.3 on [**3-11**] in the context of a presumed aspiration
event with a brief episode of hypoxia. A CXR at the time
demonstrated some increased opacities, so Metronidazole was
added with resolution of his fever and hypoxia, but he spiked
again on [**3-12**]. ID was consulted and per their recommendations,
his antibiotics were broadened to Daptomycin, Meropenem,
Voriconazole, & Flagyl. He remained afebrile afterwards, but had
several episodes of hypothermia with a nadir of 94.4. An
infectious work-up was negative and the patient never exhibited
hemodynamic instability. In the context of low cell counts, the
Infectious disease team later review the patient's medications
and recommended discontinuing his Flagyl and switching his
Meropenem to Ciprofloxacin to prevent any medication driven
reduction in his cell counts. His antibiotics were changed per
ID recommendations several times during his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, and he
returned to the BMT service on [**4-26**] on acyclovir, atovaquone,
cefepime, micafungin, and vancomycin.  He was started on
Ambisome on [**5-8**] for positive yeast culture in blood and urine.
He had Hickman cath removed on [**5-9**] by IR. On [**2151-5-10**] changed
micafungin to voriconazole. Later in his hospital course he
developed acute lethargy, and was found to be hypothermic and
hypotensive. He also c/o worsening abdominal pain.  He was
transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for presumed sepsis.  ID was
consulted overnight and his antibiotics were broadedned.  A
central line and arterial line were placed and he was started on
pressors.  He was noted to be in DIC with platelets below 10.
He had developed acute on chronic renal failure, lactic acidosis
of 11.7, acidemia with pH 6.95 and was intubated for a
respiratory rate near the 40s.  A catheter was placed for HD.
However, the following morning, his family decided to change his
goals of care to comfort measures only.  All medications were
stopped.
