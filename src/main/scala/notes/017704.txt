CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Confusion and malaise.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a pleasant 59
year old man known to the hepatobiliary transplant service
with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, hepatitis C cirrhosis, endstage liver disease
and end stage renal disease, status post cadaveric renal
transplant.  He presented to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Department on [**2170-12-16**],
complaining of increased episodes of confusion for about 24
hours.  He has been a resident of [**Hospital3 7**] since his
prior discharge.  The patient on his admission reported
recent increase in abdominal girth, lower extremity edema and
a slight diffuse abdominal pain.  His wife reported that he
was confused the night prior to admission, talking about
"[**Doctor First Name **]".  He was also mentioning spiders crawling around his
room.  Given this state, the staff at rehabilitation made a
decision to transfer the patient back to the hospital.  On
arrival, he denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
cough, chest pain and shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus.

Hypertension.

Hepatitis C.

Cholelithiasis.

Coronary artery disease.

Elevated cholesterol.

Anemia.

Asbestos exposure.

Stroke in [**2169**].

End stage renal disease, status post transplant.

End stage liver disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cadaveric renal transplant [**2170-7-26**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Old history of intravenous drug abuse, lives
with wife, denies use of alcohol or tobacco.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival, temperature is 96.8, pulse
54, blood pressure 129/69, respiratory rate 18, oxygen
saturation 96 percent in room air.  In general, a middle age
man in no acute distress, appearing jaundiced and lying in
bed.  Scleral icterus.  The pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  There is no jugular
venous distention or lymphadenopathy in the neck.  Chest
examination - There are rales bilaterally at the bases.
Cardiovascular examination is regular rhythm and no murmurs.
Abdominal examination distended abdomen with fluid and mild
diffuse tenderness without rebound or guarding.  Extremity
examination - Warm extremities with one plus palpable
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.  Neurologic
examination - Cranial nerves II through XII are intact
bilaterally, moving all extremities and no asterixis.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratories on admission
included white blood cell count 7.8, hematocrit 35.8,
platelet count 80,000, creatinine 2.2, INR 1.3, total
bilirubin 8.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was assessed by the medical
service in the Emergency Department and he was admitted to
the medical service for care of his confusion with the
differential diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy or possible
infection, quite possibly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
A transplant surgery consultation and hepatobiliary service
consultation was also obtained.  For the first two days, the
patient received his nightly tube feeds and his doses of
insulin for which he had been stabilized over the last month.
He also received a paracentesis which by diagnostic studies
revealed no evidence of infection.  His antibiotics were
therefore stopped.  On the night of [**2170-12-18**], the patient
was noticed to be in his usual clinical state with occasional
bouts of confusion.  The wife noticed that the patient may
have been slightly more confused earlier in the night.
During the middle of the night, the patient was found
unresponsive by the nursing staff and code was called for
assistance.  On arrival, the house staff found him
unresponsive, was oxygenating, and with adequate blood
pressure.  A quick check of blood glucose found a blood sugar
of 9.  The tube feeds were noticed to be running adequately
at this time.  Given this, he was given a bolus of dextrose
and the blood sugar rising to 170.  After the glucose
infusion, however, the patient was noticed to have some
tonoclonic activity which subsided with Ativan
administration.  At this time, the patient continued to be
agitated, unresponsive necessitating orotracheal intubation.
After the intubation, he was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for further resuscitative care.  Initially in the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient received placement of Swan-
Ganz catheter for optimal hemodynamic management.  His
ventilatory settings were set to optimize and reduce any
cerebral edema.  He received a head CT scan which showed no
signs of ischemia or hemorrhage and he received a neurology
consultation to assess his neurological status.  Empiric
antibiotics were started for infection prophylaxis.  The
diagnosis at this time was liver failure causing worsening
encephalopathy made significantly worse by hypoglycemia.
There was also possible seizure activity likely secondary to
the hypoglycemic episode.  The patient's subsequent hospital
course was focused on maintaining his hemodynamics,
preventing infection and awaiting neurological improvement so
that he could receive a liver transplant.  Unfortunately as
days progressed, his neurological status worsened and he
became completely unresponsive to stimulation or pain.  He
also became febrile on antibiotics and received a broadening
of his antibiotics and cultures.  Initially his cultures were
negative, however, the blood culture on [**2170-12-26**], grew out
[**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.  Given no improvement in neurological
status and unresponsive state for days without any sedation,
episodes of fevers now with fungal cultures positive by
blood, and marginal renal status, the patient was deemed
nontransplantable.  Given that the patient would not safely
receive a transplant, the condition given his liver failure
(bilirubin up to 19), extensive discussions were begun with
the family.  Discussions between the nursing staff, the
Intensive Care Unit staff, the family, transplant staff and
hepatobiliary staff all concurred that the [**Hospital 228**] medical
condition is futile without possibility of a liver
transplant.  Given that he was not a candidate to
successfully undergo a liver transplantation, the family
decided to withdraw care as this was what the patient would
have desired.  Given this, on [**2170-12-29**], the patient was
made comfort measures only.  He was placed on a Morphine drip
and the ventilatory support was withdrawn.  The Morphine drip
was started at 1:30 p.m.  The patient was extubated at 2:00
p.m. and the patient expired at 2:45 p.m. with family at
bedside.
