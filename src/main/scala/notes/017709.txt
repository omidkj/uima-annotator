Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4282**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 80860**] is a 61M with a PMH s/f CMML who is being
transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for continued management of
hypoxia.  The patient was in his usual state of health when he
began to experience mild abdominal and rectal pain three weeks
ago.  He saw his gastroenterologist and was told to complete a
course of ciprofloxacin and flaygl.  He then went to [**Country 149**] on a
business trip, where he decided not to take the flagyl given its
disulfiram-like side effects.  When he returned home, he
continued to have persistent rectal pain, with a new cough and
increasing shortness of breath and left-sided chest pain.
Specifically, his rectal pain was worsened with bowel movements
and associated with constipation and LLQ crampy pain, and he
noted scant red blood in his stools after bowel movements.  His
chest pain was described as sharp and worsened with activity and
with coughing, but without nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or
radiation to the back or arms.
.
He presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2181-2-5**] where a CXR showed a
right sided pneumonia, for which he received levofloxacin,
zosyn, IV solumedrol (long smoking history and concern for
COPD), and nebulizers.  A rectal exam revealed a new mass, which
was biopsied under general anesthesia, results are pending.  A
CT abdomen and pelvis showed mild diverticulitis.  On the fourth
hospital day, he had new, volumnious diarrhea, with 15 bowel
movements each night.  Stool was sent for C. diff, which was
positive on the third set.  PO vancomycin was started for this
rather than flagyl, based on renal recommendations.  CXRs
cleared over the course of antibiotic therapy, and the patient
remained afebrile throughout his hospital course.  His WBC count
climbed over his hospital course, however, from 40 on admission
to 109, in the setting of CMML, PNA, C. diff, and steroid
treatment.  Heme-onc was consulted, and performed a bone marrow
biopsy, which [**Name8 (MD) **] MD sign-out showed "mild blasts on flow
cytometry"; however, it was felt that this was likely
demargination from steroids, C.diff, and PNA.  He continued to
experience dyspnea, with worsening hypoxia, sating 70s on room
air, requiring a non-rebreather to maintain sats in the 90s.  A
d-dimer was negative, though it was performed while the patient
was already started on empiric anticoagulation with heparin for
presumed PE, and a V/Q scan was indeterminate.  The heparin was
stopped after the negative d-dimer.   The patient is requesting
transfer for continued management of hypoxia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61M with a PMH s/f [**Hospital 80861**] transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management of hypoxic respiratory distress.

#. Hypoxic respiratory distress:  Possible etiologies for the
patient's hypoxia were thought to include pneumonia, PE,
noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and leukostasis.  He was
empirically started on vancomycin and zosyn, and though he had a
negative D-dimer and V/Q scan at [**Hospital3 3583**] an ECHO and
LENIs were attained and demonstrated no evidence of right heart
strain or DVT.  A Broncoscopy was down and viral cultures were
RSV postive.  He was also started on hydroxyurea to prevent
leukostasis, though the heme/onc service thought that this was
unlikely to be the etiology for his hypoxia and CXR infiltrates.
 His respiratory status slowly imroved and pulmonary was
consulted to have determine when his pulmonary status had
improved enough to preceed to surgery for his anal cancer.
Pulmonary function test were performed which showed mild
restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect and reduced
diffusing capacity. He was no longer on oxygen about 6 days
prior to discharge, and pulmonary felt that it was okay to
proceed on [**2181-3-5**].

#. Leukocytosis:  Patient's WBC count increased from 40K on
admission to [**Hospital3 3583**] to 104K at time of transfer. This
was attributed to infection and steroid-effect causing massive
demargination in the setting of known CMML.  Steroids were
discontinued and hydrea was started with improvement in his
white count to 30 at discharge. He was also continued on po
flagyl for C. diff.  Blood cultures were negative. Please see
discussion below re: CMML.

#. C. diff:  Diagnosed four days after starting antibiotics at
[**Hospital3 3583**] and treated with po vancomycin per renal reccs
by their consult service because of his renal insufficiency.  He
was, however, converted to po flagyl upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**].

#. Rectal mass:  Patient was found to have a rectal mass that
was biopsied by the surgical service under anesthesia (secondary
to significant pain) at [**Hospital3 3583**].  The mass was
concerning f
