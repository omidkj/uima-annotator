CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This patient is a postoperative admit.  He
was directly admitted to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 56-year-old
gentleman with known coronary artery disease and insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, who had been previously admitted
in [**2121-5-11**] with chest pain, congestive heart failure and
ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time, but had a
positive exercise tolerance test and was brought to cardiac
catheterization during that admission.  At that time his
catheterization showed normal left main, left anterior
descending coronary artery 95% occluded, circumflex coronary
artery 70% occluded, obtuse marginal #1 70% occluded, right
coronary artery 70% occluded, no left ventriculogram was done
at that time due to an elevated creatinine, however his
ejection fraction by echocardiogram at that time was 40-45%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Diabetes mellitus with associated
neuropathy.  2. Hypertension.  3. Hypercholesterolemia.  4.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.1
to 2.5.  5. Congestive heart failure.  6. Anemia.  7.
Bilateral claudication.  8. Peripheral vascular disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1. Right fifth metatarsal resection.
2. Tonsillectomy.  3. Left eye vitrectomy.  4. Bilateral
laser surgery to both eyes.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, ampicillin and codeine, all of which make
him nauseated.

Lasix 40 mg q.d.  3. Norvasc 10 mg q.d.  4. Coreg 6.25 mg
b.i.d.  5. Glipizide 10 mg b.i.d.  6. Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
7. Lipitor 40 mg q.d.  8. Aspirin 81 mg q.d.  9. Pepcid AC no
dose or frequency provided.  10. Insulin 70/30, 21 units in
the AM and Lente 19 units in the PM.  11. IV Natrecor.  12.
Epoetin 5,000 units subcutaneous q. Saturday.  13. Vitamin
B12 1,000 mcg q. day.

LABORATORY DATA:  On his last admission white count was 7.9,
hematocrit 34.4, platelet count 211, sodium 140, potassium
4.4, chloride 104, CO2 25, BUN 41, creatinine 2.3, glucose
191.  EKG was sinus rhythm with a rate of 88, ST wave changes
laterally.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 80 and sinus rhythm, blood
pressure 168/69, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 97%
on room air.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly, positive bowel sounds.
Pulses:  Radial 2+ on the right, 1+ on the left; femoral 2+
bilaterally; dorsalis pedis 1+ bilaterally; posterior tibial
2+ bilaterally.  Extremities:  Well perfused, no clubbing,
cyanosis or edema, no varicosities.  Neurological:  Pupils
equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously, on [**6-11**] the patient
was a direct admission to the operating room at which time he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.  Please see the
operating room report for full details.  In summary, the
patient had a coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 with a left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal #1 and obtuse marginal #2 sequentially.  His bypass
time was 127 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 112 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.  At
the time of transfer the patient's mean arterial pressure was
76.  He was in sinus rhythm at 95 beats per minute.  He had
dobutamine at 5 mcg per kg per minute, Neo-Synephrine at 0.3
mcg per kg per minute and propofol at 10 mcg per kg per
minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
He was noted however to have a mixed metabolic respiratory
acidosis.  His ventilator was manipulated until the acidosis
corrected itself.  Once the acidosis corrected itself the
patient's anesthesia was reversed and he was successfully
weaned from the ventilator and extubated.  On the first
postoperative day the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was weaned from his dobutamine drip and was
scheduled to be transferred to the floor, however check of
his electrolytes prior to transfer revealed a rising
creatinine as well as some hyperkalemia.  The patient was
treated with Kayexalate and was kept in the intensive care
unit to monitor his renal status.  Additionally a renal
consultation was called on the patient.  Given his tenuous
renal status the patient stayed in the intensive care unit
for an additional three days waiting for his creatinine to
plateau.

On postoperative day four the patient's creatinine was back
down to his baseline, and on postoperative day five he was
transferred to [**4-11**] for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next two days the patient's activity level was
increased with the assistance of the nursing staff and
physical therapy.  On postoperative day six it was decided
that the patient was stable and ready to be discharged to
home.

At the time of discharge the patient's physical examination
was as follows:  Vital signs were temperature 98.2, heart
rate 75 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 122/76, respiratory
rate 18, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.  Weight
preoperatively was 107.9 kg, at discharge 113.6 kg.
Laboratory data was white count 8.0, hematocrit 27.4,
platelet count 248, sodium 140, potassium 3.8, chloride 102,
CO2 26, BUN 50, creatinine 2.3, glucose 117.  Physical
examination was alert and oriented x 3, moving all
extremities, followed commands.  Lungs had diminished distant
breath sounds, no rales appreciated.  Cardiac was regular
rate and rhythm, S1 and S2.  Sternum was stable.  The
incision with Steri-Strips was open to air, clean and dry.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normal
active bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm, well perfused,
[**12-12**]+ edema bilaterally.
