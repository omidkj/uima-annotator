Date of Birth:   [**2036-1-20**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIAC CARE UNIT

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
white female with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who
began to complain of shortness of breath and became acutely
cyanotic around 11:15 p.m. of [**2107-5-9**].  EMS was called
and upon arrival the patient became apneic and pulseless on
monitor.  The patient was noted to have sinus tachycardia at
140-150 beats per minute.  The patient was intubated with
vomitus of 60-80 cc of bilious material.  CPR was performed
briefly for two minutes.

She was taken to an outside hospital where she was given
Adenosine times two doses with 160 mg of IV Lasix and
nitroglycerin.  She became hypotensive.  Dopamine was
started.  While at the outside hospital, it was noted that
she had copious endotracheal tube secretions.  She was noted
to have a left bundle branch block.  They were unable to
locate and old EKG.  There was a question of ventricular
fibrillation and she was given lidocaine.  She was
Medflighted to [**Hospital6 256**] for
cardiac catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization showed a
tight proximal lesion of 80-90% in the right coronary artery.
There was left-to-right collateral present.  The left
circumflex showed a proximal 90% stenosis which was stented
times one.  There was diffuse left anterior descending artery
disease, ejection fraction estimated to be 38%.  Pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was about 12.  Right ventricular
pressure 43/10.  Pulmonary artery pressure 38/18/22.  Left
ventricular pressure was 114/15, aortic pressure 119/77.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Osteoporosis.
4.  Arthritis.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Fosamax.
2.  Cholesterol medications.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate
100-110, blood pressure 90/60, on assist control of 700 times
16, 100% FI02.  She was sedated with endotracheal tube in
place.  She opens eyes and responds.  She had good breath
sounds bilaterally.  She had distant cardiac sounds with a
systolic murmur at the base radiating to her neck.  The
abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, minimally distended.
Right groin with arteriovenous sheath in place.  Distal
pulses were 2+.  Her lower extremities were warm and well
perfused.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Her arterial blood gases on
presentation to the outside hospital were 7.16/60/118 on 100%
FI02.  At the [**Hospital6 256**], her first
arterial blood gas was 7.24/54/67.  The second was
7.15/60/87.  The third set was 7.34/47/139.

The white count was 16.1, hematocrit 46.5, platelets 195,000,
INR 1.2, PTT 61.  Sodium 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 103,
bicarbonate 19, BUN 30, creatinine 1.4, glucose 325.

The chest x-ray showed mild to moderate congestive heart
failure with endotracheal tube in good position.

The CK peaked at 477 and trended down to 72 by the time of
discharge.  Her troponin was elevated at 31.5.  A cholesterol
panel was sent off.  Total cholesterol 197, triglycerides
137, HDL 46, LDL 124.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient finished
her 18 hour course of Integrelin post cardiac catheterization
and stenting.  She was started on aspirin, Plavix, a beta
blocker, and ACE inhibitor.  She continued to do well without
any events on telemetry.  Her CKs and troponins trended down.
She had no further episodes of any active ischemia.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was diuresed and quickly weaned
off the ventilator and extubated without any problems.  She
was weaned off of her oxygen requirement and by the time of
discharge was saturating 97% on room air with stable 02 sat
on ambulation.

3.  RENAL: She presented with acute renal failure with
creatinine of 1.4 to 1.5.  Her creatinine trended down to 0.6
to 0.7 by the time of discharge.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  There was some concern about
possible aspiration pneumonia; however, the patient remained
afebrile with improving pulmonary status.  She was not
started on antibiotics and remained stable.

5.  HEMATOLOGY: After catheterization, the patient had a drop
in her hematocrit to the 30s.  It remained stable throughout
the rest of her hospital stay.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged in good condition to
be followed-up by her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and
with her cardiologist in less than two weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Anterior myocardial infarction.
2.  Mitral valve regurgitation.
3.  Cardiogenic shock.

MAJOR INVASIVE PROCEDURES:
1.  Intubation.
2.  Cardiac catheterization with stent placement.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4.  Carvedilol 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Fosamax as previously taken.
