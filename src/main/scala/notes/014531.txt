Brief Hospital Course:
38 year old female with recent admission for spontaneous
intracrainial bleed with residual L hemiparesis, trachestomy and
PEG tube who presented from rehab 2 days after discharge from
BIMC with hypoxia and fever. Found to have right middle lobe
infiltrate. Was treated for hospital aquired PNA with vanocmycin
and zosyn, initially and then narrowed to Bactrim. ID consulted
[**12-16**] with resulting change to IV Unasyn x 14 days.
.
# Hypoxia: Likely secondary to right middle lobe PNA seen on
admission chest x-ray.
- hypoxia improved with antibiotics
.
# Pneumonia: On admission, fevers, leukocytosis and right middle
lobe infiltrate consisent with PNA. Patient given Ceftriaxone
and Azithromycin at OSH; however, the patient was recently
hospitalized, then at rehab and has a trach, putting her at risk
for HAP, MSRA and Pseudomonas so she was treated with vancomycin
and zosyn. Urine leigonella was negative.  Sputum later showed
Acinetobacter and MSSA, therefore ID was consulted.  Bactrim was
subsequently d/c'd and patient was started on Unasyn x 2 weeks
(day 1 = [**2193-12-17**]).
.
# Intracranial hemorrhage: Patient sustained a spontaneous
sub-arachnoid hemorrhage and was admitted here for treatment and
discharged on [**2193-12-10**] to rehab. Daily dilantin levels were
checked.
- Currently subtherapeutic; likely partially due to PEG route,
need larger doses.
- goal level 15-30. Increased dilantin from 300 mg TID to 400 mg
PGT TID on [**2193-12-16**].
- Please follow dilantin levels and titrate doses accordingly.
.
# LE swelling. Patient was also noted to have LLE swelling, and
had a LENI which showed an acute DVT. She was started on heparin
gtt with bridge to coumadin, however with further discussion
with patient's Neurosurgeon (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], decision was made to
d/c anticoagulation and have a temporary IVC filter placed due
to the risks associated with anticoagulation in the setting of
recent ICH. A temporary IVC filter was placed on [**2193-12-17**].
Please follow patient's DVT's and have her IVC filters removed
when no longer clinically indicated.
.
# Constipation. She was markedly constipated, and received
manual disimpaction and an aggressive bowel regimen with relief
of her symptoms.
- continue bowel regimen
.
# FEN: Continued tube feeds via PEG. Patient is able to eat as
per S+S recs, however she still is not taking sufficient oral
nutrition/hydration. Wean tube feeds as po nutrition improves.
# Access: PICC line.
