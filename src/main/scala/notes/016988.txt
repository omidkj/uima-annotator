Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Attempted PVI


History of Present Illness:
74 M w/ recent admission for afib w/ [**Hospital 5509**] transferred from OSH in
afib w/ RVR (HR 160s-180s) now controlled on dilt ggt. Already
planning for PVI tomorrow.

In the ED, initial vitals:Time 19:42 0 97.4 80-100 119/86 18
95-97 on 2L. EKG afib w/ LBBB, similar to prior. Dilt ggt at 10
mg/ hr. HR now in low 100s.

On arrival to the floor, he converted to SR in the 80s. He
states that the palpitations began yesterday morning and they
awakened him from sleep, along w/ increased dyspnea. Denies
cp/f/c. Occasional cough. He denies orthopnea or pnd although he
notes that he sleeps more comfortably on his R side.

He endorses chronic L leg pain for which he takes vicodin.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2167-4-14**]:
Focused study: Initially, there is a moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. Towards
the end of the study, there is resolution of the effusion with
only a trivial amount remaining and improvement in right
ventricular filling.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-3-3**], the
pericardial effusion is new. The current study only consists of
limited views and cannot be compared to the prior
echocardiogram.

TTE [**2167-4-15**]:
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is mild to moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-45 %). The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-4-14**],
the findings are similar. The size of the effusion is similar.

Renal US [**2167-4-17**]:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. 1.2 cm right kidney angiomyolipoma.
3. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. However
other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver diseased
(i.e. cirrhosis/fibrosis) cannot be excluded.

CXR [**2167-4-21**]
In comparison with the study of [**4-17**], substantial enlargement of

the cardiac silhouette persists but there is no evidence of
congestive
failure. Small amount of opacification in the right costophrenic
angle could reflect some atelectasis or residual effusion. No
evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

Head CT [**2167-4-22**]:
No acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
74yo M with with multiple admissions for difficult to control AF
with RVR, admitted for PVI, but hospital course complicated by
cardiac tamponade, VT arrest, ATN, CHF and altered mental
status.

#. Atrial fibrillation: Patient was admitted after converting to
NSR in ED. He went for PVI. Prior to ablation he developed
hypotension and tachycardia. A stat TTE revealed pericardial
effusion and tamponade. He had a JP drain placed and drained
1300mL. A repeat tte showed trivial effusion. After this he had
several follow up TTEs with no change in the trivial effusion
and no evidence of tamponade. On admission to the CCU he was in
NSR, however, over the course of the night he began to have runs
of tachycardia consistent with his previous episodes of afib. He
then developed a wide complex tachycardia and was pulseless. He
received 3 shocks, epinephrine, vasopressin, and amiodarone
bolus followed by an amiodarone drip after he regained a pulse.
He was continued on the amiodarone drip as well as a diltiazem
drip for rate and rhythm control, and transitioned to oral
amiodarone and oral diltiazem. After transfer out of ICU, pt
continued to go into and out of afib, with adequate rate control
on up-titrated diltiazem, metoprolol and amiodarone.

# Systolic Heart Failure: On TTE patient was noted to have new
low EF. Unclear if this was secondary to tachycardia induced CM
vs ischemic CM vs (most like) effect of VT
arrest/shocks/compressions. Further evaluation was deferred
until pt given time to recover. Would recommend repeat TTE in 1
month to reassess for residual function and decide course
accordingly. In the setting of this new CHF and positive fluid
balance and minimal urine output, pt became significantly volume
overloaded with new pulmonary edema. He was diuresed
successfully with lasix. On discharge, CXR was improved, but BNP
was still elevated. Pt's lisinopril was held in the setting of
renal failure.
