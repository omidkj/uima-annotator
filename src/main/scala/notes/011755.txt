J-point elevations appearing more prominent than prior ECG dated

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2178-1-26**] 5:52 PM
IMPRESSION: Kyphotic chest without evidence of acute pulmonary
disease. Hiatal hernia.

CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2178-1-26**] 8:45 PM

IMPRESSION:

1. Apparent thickening of the rectal mucosa with enhancement.
This could be due to infection, tumor, or ischemia. Further
workup with sigmoidoscopy is recommended.

2. No evidence of free air or free fluid within the abdomen.

3. Left adrenal adenoma.

4. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. An ultrasound

5. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 88 yo female with history of GI bleed, COPD admitted for
recurrence of GIB with hypotension.

1. GI bleed.- The patient had recent C-scope in [**9-2**], EGD
negative [**9-2**]. Received 3 U prbc's since admission, Hct bumped
appropriately from 25 to 34. Her serial hematocrits remained
stable throughout her stay at around 33. Her blood pressure
remained stable and she was restarted on Lisinopril 20 mg and
was started on Atenolol 25 mg daily on the day of discharge
which should be increased to Atenolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2178-1-30**].
Gastroenterology decided against a repeat endoscope/colonoscopy
during her stay as the patient remained stable. The patient
should follow up with gastroenterology as an outpatient.

2. J-point vs ST elevation in v1-v4: The patient ruled out for
an acute myocardial infarction. Her aspirin was held secondary
to an acute GI bleed. This may be restarted as an outpatient.

4. COPD: The patient remained stable. She was continued on
atrovent, folvent, albuterol, accolate.

5. ARF: Her acute renal failure was most likely secondary to
being pre-renal. Her creatinine improved with hydration.

6. Code: DNR/DNI

7. The patient was found to have a urinary tract infection
growing E. Coli and was treated with Bactrim DS for 7-10 days.
