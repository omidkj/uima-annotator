Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2265**]
Chief Complaint:
Right-sided Back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
82 yo F w/ PMH pulmonary hypertension on 3-4L O2 at home, CAD
s/p MI with stent placement in RCA/LAD in [**2140**] and LMCA and LAD
in [**4-23**], HTN, dyslipidemia, PVD, CKD (baseline 2.5-2.9), COPD
who p/w acute onset of back pain. She explains that at 4pm in
the afternoon, she had sudden onset of pain at her R waist that
started at her back and traveled to her side. She describes it
as a "deep" pain, [**9-22**], that was not worse w/ movement or
breathing and did not radiate. It subsided after 3 hrs, though
she relates no specific alleviating factors. She had associated
dyspnea and turned her oxygen from up from 3L to 4L with
subsequent relief. She also reported slight nausea at the
beginning of the episode that relieved. She denies other
associated symptoms such as fevers/chills, chest pain,
diaphoresis, abd pain, lightheadedness, or dizziness. She denies
any increased swelling in her extremities and reports a 5 pound
weight loss over the last month. She explains that she has not
been eating well due to not feeling well secondary to her PVD.
.
Initial vitals in the ED were HR 89 BP 108/73 R 25 O294% 4L NC.
She had elevated BNP (30,000) and troponin (0.09 - higher than
baseline). Bedside echo showed large RA, RV concerning for
worsening pulm HTN which may be the cause of her elevated BNP.
Got 20mg IV lasix with BP down to 80s/60s with 86% on 5L NC, but
improved with stimulation and NRB.  Then was 94% on NRB, BP up
to 102/70s which is where she has been. She was given fentanyl
for the back pain with subsequent hypotension. EKG showed sinus
with RAD, RBBB but nothing new, questionable ST depressions in
lateral leads. Upon transfer, vitals were 78, 96% NRB, 16,
116/64. She was put on 4L NC with O2 sats ###. She is currently
feeling comfortable with no dyspnea and is pain-free. She has no
other acute symptoms.
.
Pt last saw her Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2257**], on [**2149-9-15**], where
she appeared cardiovascularly stable and will see him again as
needed.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

IMAGING
[**2149-9-16**] ECG: RBBB, TWI II, III, aVF and ST depressions V4 and V5
and PVCs (unchanged from prior)
.
[**2149-9-16**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Mild pulmonary edema, perhaps
minimally worse compared to the prior study, with small
bilateral pleural effusions. Hyperinflation of the lungs
compatible with underlying emphysema.
.
[**2149-9-16**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST: The spleen, pancreas,
adrenal glands, and liver are unremarkable within the
constraints of this non-contrast study. The patient is status
post cholecystectomy. Note is made of renal hypodensities in the
left kidney, which are unchanged and in keeping with simple
cysts. The right kidney is atrophic. Regional vascular
structures are notable for extensive atherosclerotic
calcification of the aorta. The patient is status post
aortobifemoral bypass graft, which appears unchanged. There is
no evidence of expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is a
large duo
