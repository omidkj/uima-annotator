History of Present Illness:

HPI: History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year
old female with history of rheumatic heart disease s/p MVR and
recent TVR, afib, severe tracheomalacia s/p trach/PEG, celiac
disease who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2186-8-13**] to
[**2186-8-18**] for management of diarrhea and fever. During this
admission the patient had a CT Abd/Pelvis revealing for colitis
and ascites. The patient was treated empirically for C. Diff
with Flagyl tid with report of significantly decreased diarrhea
on discharge although no stool cultures are available for
review. The patient underwent a 1.5L paracentesis this admission
with cell count consistent with SBP, culture negative, for which
the patient was treated with Ceftriaxone during hospitalization
and on discahrge. Finally, the patient additionally had sputum
cultures performed which revealed Stenotrephomonas for which the
patient was treated with Bactrim although this was discontinued
after 3 days given low clinical suspicion for pneumonia. The
patient's tube feeds were resumed with report of improved
adominal pain. A PICC line was placed on [**8-17**] for Abx use. Of
note, prior to this admission the patient additionally was
reported to have coag negative staph bacteremia-oxacillin
resistant. Blood cultures during this last hospitalization did
not reveal any growth, a TTE was performed which did not reveal
any obvious vegetations.
    With regards to her remaining issues the patient was
continued on lasix and aldactone for management of her ascites.
The patient is suspected to have cirrhosis with portal
hypertension secondary to severe TR. She was otherwise
maintained on her outpatient [**Hospital 1902**] medical regimen. The patient is
now s/p trach/peg for severe tracheomalacia and significant
Right sided pleural effusion. She was noted to have a
respiratory alkalosis, often overbreathing the vent, noted to be
tolerating PS for several hours at a time of discharge.
.
The patient today at her facility was found to be hypotensive
with SBP in the 80s. She received 300cc bolus with improvement
of SBP to 103.

ED Course: Vitals T- none recorded. HR: 126  BP: 110/70
- In the ED blood and urine cultures obtained. The patient was
treated empirically with CTX, Vanc, Flagyl. A central line was
placed and the patient was started on Levophed for hypotension.
The patient was given 2U PRBCs.

General: Patient is a chronically ill appearing female, with
buccal wasting but gross anasarca. Patient is with trach in
place, breathing relatively comfortably

regurgitant murmurs appreciated

Pertinent Results:
.
ECG: 120, Afib, RAD. QRS 130, +RBBB. Deep TWI V1-V4. Unchanged
from previous.
.
Imaging:
[**2186-8-18**]: Portable Chest -
IMPRESSION:  Post-line placement, without pneumothorax.
Unchanged appearance of the chest with marked cardiomegaly and
bibasilar opacities most likely representing atelectasis,
however, pneumonia cannot be totally excluded especially in the
left lower lobe.  Clinical correlation is recommended.
.
[**2186-8-12**]: CT Abdomen/Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple foci of intraperitoneal gas could be related to
recent
gastrostomy placement (when was this installed?) but
intraperitoneal
infection cannot be excluded. No evidence of extravasation of
oral contrast.
2. Wall thickening of the ascending colon and hepatic flexure.
This is a common finding in cirrhosis complicated by ascites.
However, it is pronounced enough to suggest possible underlying
colitis.
3. Cirrhosis.  Significant increase in volume of ascites, which
is now large.
4. Extensive body wall edema.
5. Marked cardiomegaly and biatrial enlargement.
6. Moderate right pleural effusion and atelectasis of the base
of the right lower lobe.  Small left pleural effusion.
.
Echocardiogram: [**2186-8-14**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The right atrium is markedly dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 35-40 %). Right ventricular cavity size is increased
with free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The degree of mitral
regurgitation seen is normal for this prosthesis. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve
is present. The tricuspid prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Left RP Bleed - Pt presented with hypotension; Pt found to
have a large left RP hematoma on CT ABdomen.  Pt was
aggressively rescusitated with 14 Units of RBCs and
cryoprecipitate and FFP.  Pt was evaluated by surgery who felt
that she wouldn't need surgical intervention but more likely IR
embolization if she were to become hemodynamically unstable.
Patient did not require further treatment of the RP bleed and
her Hcts remained stable.  She was restarted on IV heparin and
transitioned to coumadin for an INR goal of 2.5-3.5 and her Hct
remained stable during this transition phase.
.
#[**Name (NI) 27035**] Pt had culture of blood, urine, sputum, and
stool. Sent Stool for C. Diff Tox
