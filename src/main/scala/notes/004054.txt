Brief Hospital Course:
# CHF - Patient was admitted with CHF exacerbation felt to be
secondary to confusion regarding medication regimen.  A PA
catheter was placed and showed CVP=22, RA=25, RV=70/26,
PA=70/32, PCWP=32.  He was diuresed with improvement in
pulmonary edema and was started on lasix, hydralazine,
isosorbide dinitrate, and digoxin.  His lisinopril and aldactone
were discontinued due to increasing potassium and history of
hyperkalemia.
.
# CAD - He was continued on ASA, atorvastatin, digoxin and
started on hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate for afterload
reduction in place of his lisinopril. He was hemodynamically

cells, and follow up as outpatient for further workup including
cystoscopy and CT urogram (cr 1.9), MR-urogram or U/S.
