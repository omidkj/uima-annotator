Brief Hospital Course:
OR/Post-op course: Pt was taken to OR on HD#4 for exploratory
laparotomy. L oophorectomy with resection of 25cm L ovarian mass
was performed.  Prelim path report: spindle cell neoplasm,
benign. EBL 100cc, 1L ascites drained.   Pt was kept intubated
during transfer to SICU but was extubated the evening of POD#0.
Pt reported marked symptomatic improvement post-operatively w/
respect to abdominal pain and respiratory status.  She was
transferred out of SICU back to floor POD#1.

CV:  [**Name (NI) 4452**], pt was persistently tachycardic with HR's in
100-110's.  EKG x 2 was performed, both showing sinus
tachycardia with no ST/T wave changes.  Pt was clinically
euvolemic with good UOP, and so tachycardia likely due to fever
and pain.  BP remained stable throughout course.  Post-op,
tachycardia resolved with HR's in the 90's.

Pulm: Because of ?pulm infiltrate seen on CXR at [**Hospital1 1474**] and pt
febrile, was started on IV levofloxacin for possible pneumonia.
Chest CT performed HD#2 showed bibasilar opacities likely
secondary to atelectasis but could not exclude pneumonia.  Pt
required supplemental O2 (2-3L) while in house likely secondary
to a combination of pna/atelectasis/ascites.  Atrovent nebulizer
treatments were given as needed for wheezing.  Post-op,
respiratory status improved significantly and she had no oxygen
requirement.

Heme: Hct remained stable throughout course (32.7-->32) and pt
did not require any blood products.

ID:
--[**Name (NI) 4452**], pt was intermittently febrile with Tmax of 102.4.
Though fever was thought to be due primarily to large pelvic
tumor/torsion/pulm infection, other sources of infection were
investigated.  Urinalysis was negative x 2, urine cultures still
pending. KUB showed no evidence of obstruction or perforation.
2 sets of blood cultures x 4 showed no growth. Spiked to high of
101.5 on [**6-20**]; CXR ordered at that time showed no evidence PNA,
urine Cx and blood cultures negative
--IV levofloxacin was administered throughout course for
possible pulm infection as described above; pt was discharged on
oral abx

Pt was found to be stable for discharge on [**2106-6-22**].
