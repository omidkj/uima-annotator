Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and taken to the operating room by the
urology service. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the Chairman's general surgery
service was called in for intra-operative consult to assist with
small bowel injury. Please refer to the two operative notes of
[**2185-3-21**] for further details of the surgeries.

The patient was taken to the SICU in the immediate
post-operative period. She was intubated and sedated, and
steadily weaned from the mechanical ventilator. Late on POD#1,
the patient was breathing so well that she was extubated and
transferred to the floor. Her home medications were restarted on
POD#2, and she was given a clear liquid diet which she tolerated
well. On POD#3, she worked with Physical Therapy to ambulate and
begin her strengthening and rehabilitation. On POD#4, flatus was
noted in the ostomy. The patient was advanced to a regular diet
which she tolerated without issue. On POD#5, the patient had
stool in her ostomy. By the time of discharge, the patient was
tolerating a regular diet, able to ambulate with her walker, and
her ostomy was fully functional. Her pain was under control with
oral pain medications.

The hospital course of this 88-year-old female was marked by a
speedy recovery. She surpassed expectations for her recovery,
much to the happiness of the staff. She will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility which is near her duaghters' homes. She
is to follow up in clinic with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **].
