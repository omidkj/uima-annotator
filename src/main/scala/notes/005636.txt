Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 87 woman with multiple vascular risk factors
including PAF not on coumadin, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, who
p/w right hand (distal) weakness and possibly a mild right lower
face droop.  Her findings are most likely consistent with a
small embolic stroke, likely from her afib, to the left cortex.
Per the daughter, it sounds as though the right hand weakness
has improved over the past 24 hours.  Initially she was unable
to make a fist or elevate her fingers.  On the day after
admission she was weak in the distal right arm (brachioradialis,
biceps. wrist extensors, finger flexors), not plegic.

Workup included: < 40% stenosis ICA bilaterally.  Ruled out for
MI.  CT head unrevealing.  Tele unrevealing.

She came in on aspirin 81 mg.  I have discussed with the family
re: treatment options:  1. increasing ASA to 325 mg.  2.
starting aggrenox or plavix.  or 3.  coumadin given her afib.
The family is not interested in coumadin given her past fall and
SDH.  THey are most interested in increasing the dose of aspirin
to 325 mg po [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] that was done.

We continued all of her current meds.  PT/OT were consulted.
