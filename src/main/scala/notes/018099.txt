Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11291**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased seizure frequency to [**5-2**] sz/day with increased
coughing episodes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right temporal lobe cyst fenestration to the
posterior fossa and placement of Rickham reservoir with
catheter in the cyst cavity


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 69yo F, who has PMH of seizure, who presented with
the CC of cough and increasing frequency of seizure.
She was in her USOH until [**2105-12-26**] when she cought a cold, which
progressed to bronchitis. Her cold got better in a week, leaving
the cough with yellow sputum.  She lost her voice for a month,
and was diagnosed with fungal infection of esophagus and vocal
cord.  Her cough once got better (though it did not disappear)
in
summer [**2106**], with the anti-fungus medication, which she took
from
[**2106-8-27**] to [**2107-3-27**]. Her cough exacerbated in [**2107-2-27**]. Lying back
makes this dry cough worse and does wake her up at night. It
gets
worse from morning towards afternoon, but it is basically
consistant for all the day. It is alleviated by albuterol nebs,
but comes back after a while.
The pt also complained of the increasing frequency of seizure,
from once/year to 4-6times/day since last month. Her husband
described that it starts in Lt side getting stiff, and then the
Rt side gets stiff.  It is resolved by Rameron in few minutes
but
repeats 4-6 times in 4 hours.  Pt and her husband stated that
she
can hear but cannot respond, and that the is tired but not
confused after the seizures.
The cough and seizure are associated with 8/10 bitemporal
throbbing HA, which is alleviated by tylenol.

ROS found pain in leg and fall from her bed 2-3 weeks ago, which
made a bruise on her leg.
Denied weight change, fever, chills, sweats, night sweats, chest
pain, abd pain, diarrhea or change in urination.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o RHF with R Temporal Epilepsy s/p R temporal lobectomy,
[**Doctor Last Name 1193**] Chiari s/p tonsillectomy who presented with increasing
cough. She was on EEEG-LTM. The coughs were associated with R
temporal spikes in EEG. She was also having seizures which
consisted of left side stiffening and shaking. Patient underwent
drainage of right temporal cystic area & placement of reservoir
in R temporal lobe on [**5-13**]. Seizures accociated with cough
decreased significantly. She continues to have seizures 1-2 per
day whose semiology can be partial complex with left sided jerks
or episodes in which she would "freeze". Patient was febrile for
5 days after surgery; CSF collected from shunt from reservoir
showed WBC 800 RBC 2800 with 82% eosinophils. Eosinophilia and
fever prompted a broad infectious work-up as per ID
recommendation. Patient was started empirically on vancomycin,
ceftazidine which were stopped on [**2107-5-26**] as patient was
afebrile and cultures were negative. Serologies for toxoplasma,
RPR, cryptococcal were negative. EBV PCR, TB PCR from CSF.
[**Location (un) **], cysticercosis, trichinella, LCMV antibodies are
pending.

In summary:
SEIZURES: Patient has a baseline [**5-1**] seizures per day. Semiology
can be cough, left side jerks or "freezing episodes". Coushing
seizures improved significantly after neurosurgical procedure as
above
**SEIZURES SHOULD BE TREATED WITH ATIVAN 1-2MG AT REHAB IF THEY
LAST LONGER THAN 5 MINUTES OR SHE HAS MORE THAN 2 SEIZURES
WITHIN ONE HOUR.
Continue AEM as per prescriptions including topamax , lamictal,
gabapentin.

ID: Patient has been afebrile for more than 72 hours; off
antibiotics since [**2107-5-26**]. She should have Serologies for
toxoplasma, RPR, cryptococcal were negative. EBV PCR, TB PCR
from CSF. [**Location (un) **], cysticercosis, trichinella, LCMV antibodies
are pending and should be followed-up in next appointment. The
fever etiology is mostly likely non-infectious but a reaction to
the neurosurgical procedure: placement of Rickham reservoir with
catheter in the cyst cavity.
