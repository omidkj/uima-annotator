Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**]
Chief Complaint:
difficulty speaking

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2201-3-19**] Exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy and open
cholecystectomy
[**2201-3-31**] Open tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic-guided
gastrostomy tube


History of Present Illness:
82 yo man with a complicated PMH including Afib on coumadin,
stroke, vasculopathy (s/p right CEA, CABG, AAA), malignancy
(prostate cancer s/p resection and XRT as well as
cholangiocarcinoma with possible metastaic disease),
hypothyroidism, now off coumadin since [**2-27**] after a recent GIB in
the setting of significantly supratherapeutic INR ~8, who
presents today with 5 discrete episodes of a Broca's type
aphasia with reported return to baseline between events.  The
patient was in his usual state of health after his recent
hospital discharge, when he awoke this morning at 730 am to an
[**8-2**] minute episode of garbled speech.  He was aware of the
problem and could understand his wife, and was quite frustrated.
 The episode resolved and he had another [**8-2**] minute episode at
breakfast. He decided to head to an OSH at [**Location (un) **], and had the
exact same episode of similar duration in route.  At [**Location (un) **], he
was hypotensive initially at 93/52.  Head CT was apparently
unchanged from prior imaging (showed left cerebellar
encephalomalacia and evidence of atrophy by my read) and INR was
1.8.  He received 325 mg ASA x 1 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.  He apparently had one additional
episode of the same nature and duration en route to [**Hospital1 18**] or on
arrival here.  He is currently at his baseline.
.
Review of Systems:
Only significant for "blurred" vision most of the day yesterday,
as if he was looking through tears.  Otherwise, no HA, F/C, N/V,
dysphagia, changes in hearing, smell, taste, weakness, numbness,
tingling.

Past Medical History:
-Afib on warfarin
-Reports 3 strokes in past, unclear  nature
-CAD/CABG ~15 years ago
-AAA
s/p likely CEA many years ago
-Anemia- recent GIB at [**Location (un) **] with Hct drop to 21 in setting of
INR ~8.  Was reversed and anticoagulation held since [**2-27**].  Had
EGD and colonoscopy with a possible mass at right hepatic
flexure
by one document, extent of bleeding not clear
-Cholangiocarcinoma, s/p biliary stent [**9-29**]
-Prostate cancer s/p resection and XRT


Social History:
Lives with wife.  [**Name (NI) **] EtOh or drug abuse.  Off tobacco x 40
years,
smoked 1 ppd x 25 years.


Family History:
Believes his mother had stroke in her 80s


Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 98.8 HR 73nsr, BP 108/52, RR 29 96%on trach mask 0.50
General: NAD
HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, MMM, no exudates in oropharynx
Neck: supple, no bruits, trach in place
Lungs: mildly coarse b/l
CV: regular rate and rhythm, + SEM
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, mildly distended, bowel sounds
present, well healing miline incision, stable mild erythema
peri-incisional
Ext: warm, 1+ lower extremity edema




Pertinent Results:
Notable OSH labs:
WBC 12.6 (75% PMN) H/H 10.4 and 31.2, plt 349
TnI 0.12
PT 17.0/INR 1.8/PTT 36.7

[**3-7**] MRI head: No evidence of acute infarct or abnormal
enhancement. Chronic left cerebellar infarct.
[**3-7**] MRA neck: Mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic disease with
probable ulcerated plaque at the left internal carotid origin.
Otherwise, the MRA is normal.
[**3-7**] MRA head: Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within
the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
[**3-11**] GI bleeding scan: No evidence of active bleeding.
[**3-13**] CT torso: impression: 1. 4-cm mass in the ascending colon
likely represents the patient's known colon carcinoma. Please
note that there is a second lesion in the sigmoid colon that is
suggestive of a larger polyp.
2. Multiple liver lesions concerning for metastatic disease.
3. Enhancing soft tissue around the common hepatic duct as well
as the right and left hepatic ducts. While this appearance is
more typically seen in cholangiocarcinoma, metastasis to the
biliary tree from colon carcinoma is included in the
differential diagnosis. A biliary stent is present and there is
mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
4. Small amount of ascites surrounding the liver and in the deep
pelvis.
5. Infrarenal aortic aneurysm measuring 4.1 cm.
6. Chronic loculated pericardial effusion.
7. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions and chronic
interstitial changes in the lung bases.

[**Doctor Last Name **]/mb&#732;&#8230;
DIAGNOSIS:
I.  Right colon (A-Z):
1.  No malignancy identified.
2.  Four adenomas, 0.4 to 4.7 cm in greatest dimension.
3.  Twenty-four lymph nodes with no malignancy identified.
4.  Appendix, within normal limits.
II.  Gallbladder (AA-AB):
1.  Mild chronic cholecystitis, with marked distention and
dilatation.
2.  Fibrotic nodule on serosa.

[**3-19**] echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= XX %). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. The descending
thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


[**4-7**] CXR: moderate right pleural effusion persists in a patient
with huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and the
tracheostomy tube in place.
