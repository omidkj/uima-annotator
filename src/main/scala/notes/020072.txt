Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler Test Location:
Anesthesia West OR cardiac
Contrast: None Tech Quality: Adequate
Tape #: 2012AW1-: Machine: us3
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  55% to 60%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderate/severe MVP. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
The windows are of limited quality as the heart seems rotated,
and the LA seems distorted by the prolapsing mitral leaflets.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation.
There is moderate/severe bileaflet leaflet mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is in SR, on no inotropes.
There is a prosthetic mitral valve with no leak and no MR.

with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Follwoing admission she was taken to  the operating Room on
[**2198-12-28**] where she underwent mitral valve replacement with a 31mm
St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical prosthesis via right thorocotomy.  She
weaned from bypass easily. She transferred to the CVICU in
stable condition weaned from the ventilator and extubated
without diffuculty.  She transferred to the floor, where CTs and
temporary wires were removed per protocols.  Anticoagulation for
her mechanical valve was started and after a couple of days
Hepairn was initiated. Pt has known psychosocial issues, she has
continued to need a lot of attention and encouragement. She was
seen by the social worker and was started on antidepressent for
her depression. Postoperatively she was tachycardic and
occasionally hypotensive. TTE was obtained on POD#7.... and beta
blocker was stopped and restarted at lower dose. Diuretic were
dc'd early due to the concern for dehydration. She continued to
make slow progress and at the time of discharge she was
discharged to home with services and therapeutic INR. Coumadin
will be managed by the cardiac surgery service for one week then
she will transition to the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Follow up
appointments were given and precautions and instructions
discussed.
