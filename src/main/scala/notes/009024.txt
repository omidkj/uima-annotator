History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 60 year old male who began to experience
shortness of breath in [**2129-12-12**]. Over the last several
months, his shortness of breath has worsened, and is now
associated with pedal edema and orthopnea. He was admitted to
[**Hospital1 **] on [**5-11**] with congestive heart failure. Troponins
were elevated at that time. Echocardiogram revealed an LVEF of
15-20% with moderate mitral regurgitation. He required
aggressive diuresis with gradual improvement in symptoms. He
eventually underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease. Based upon the
above, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical
intervention.

2-4 beers per night. Lives with his girlfriend. [**Name (NI) 1403**] as an

[**2130-5-22**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis and
apical akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
[**2130-5-23**] Renal US: The right kidney is small, measuring 8.4 cm.
The left kidney is small, measuring 9.5 cm. Cortical thickness
and echogenicity are within normal limits. There is no
hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or evidence of solid renal
mass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 72839**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. Repeat echocardiogram
showed an LVEF of 30-35% with moderate-severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. There was mild mitral
regurgitation and mild aortic insufficiency. It also was notable
for mild tricuspid regurgitation with moderate PA systolic
hypertension. Dental consultation revealed very poor dentition
which eventually required teeth extraction prior to surgical
intervention. Given renal insufficiency and rise in
creatinine(peak 1.5), the renal service was consulted. His
slight decline in renal function was attributed to aggressive
diuresis and it was recommended to discontinue the ACE inhibitor
prior to surgery. The heart failure service was consulted to
assist in the management of his ischemic cardiomyopathy. Mr.
[**Known lastname 72839**] otherwise remained stable on medical therapy. He was
eventually cleared for surgery after his liver and renal
function tests improved.

On [**5-29**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting and a mitral valve repair. For surgical details, please
see seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation,
he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. He weaned from inotropic support without difficulty.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day one. He has remained hemodynamically stable,
and progressed well from a PT standpoint.  He is ready to be
discharged home today.
