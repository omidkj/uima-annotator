[**2119-9-29**] CXR: There is a consolidation at the left lower lobe
with air bronchograms. There is diffuse opacification of both
lung fields. There is mild re-distribution of pulmonary
vasculature, but no septal lines and no frank evidence for
pulmonary edema. The heart and great vessels of the mediastinum
are stable. Severe thoracolumbar scoliosis is again noted.

IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia with more diffuse
pneumonia or mild pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 59 yo patient with advanced MS presents with multilobar
PNA.
.
1.) Multilobar Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient had a
fever, cough, and chest xray finding s consistent with
pneumonia.  He developed progressive respiratory distress and
was electively intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
He underwent a bronchoscopy which on lavage releaved staph
aureas (methicillin resistant) and a moderate amount of
hemorrhage.  He was treated initially with broad spectrum
antibiotics which were later tailored once antibiotic
sensitivities were available.  He will complete a 14 day course
of vancomycin (7 days of which after discharge).  Of note, he
did develop a self-limited mild eosinophilia while on zosyn.  He
did not develop a rash or clinically worsen.  This should not be
thought of as an absolute contra-indication for future zosyn
therapy should this antibiotic be clinically indicated.  He was
gradually weaned from the venilator as he was diuresed with
furosemide and acetazolamide.  He was successfully extubated and
upon discharge he had stable oxygenation with supplemental
oxygen by face mask.  A PICC line was placed for antibiotics.
His vancomycin on the day of discharge was held for a high
trough level.  His goal vancomycin trough should be [**10-6**].  He
will be discharged on 1 gram of vancomycin every day which can
be adjusted per vancomycin trough.  He received nebulized
bronchodilators.
.
2.) Hypotension: The patient did develop hypotension to sbp ~90
during his admission.  This was thought likely to be from
sepsis.  He was fluid resusitated and received brief period of
vasopressors.  He had an appropriate response on [**Last Name (un) 104**]-stim
testing and did not require steroid replacement.  Upon discharge
he was normotensive with maintenance of adequate urine output
and stable creatinine.
.
3.) Anemia. Hct 27 (baseline low 40's). Guiac positive ostomy
output per ED. The hematocrit drop was thought secondary to the
pulmonary hemorrhage with subsequent blood being swallowed into
the stomach.  His hematocrit stabilized.  He did not require
blood transfusions.
.
4.) Hypothyroid: no acute issues during this hospitalization and
he continued on his home dose of synthroid.
.
5.) GERD. PPI, elevate head of bed.
.
6.) Psych. H/o schizoaffective disorder, anxiety.  The patient
is non-verbal and minimally responsive at baseline and it was
difficult to assess mood or thought disorders.  A psychiatry
consult was obtained to make recommendations on use of the
patient's despiramine during this acute illness.  A despramine
level was checked and found to not be toxically elevated.  He
was continued on this medication.  He received versed and
fentanyl while intubated then low dose ativan as needed for
anxiety and agitation post-extubation.
.
7.) Multiple Sclerosis: The patient has advance multiple
sclerosis. He has a neurogenic bladder and chronically foley
dependent.  Urine output was monitored with foley catheter in
place
.
8.)  PPx. PPI, Heparin SC, hold bowel reg/has colostomy
.
9.)  FEN. He recieved tube feeds via his gastrostomy tube.  His
electrolytes were repleted as necessary.
.
10.) Thrombocytosis: The patient had an elevated platelet count
which was thought to be a reactive process secondary to his
resolving pneumonia exacerbated by the diuresis that was
required to resolve the pulmonary edema.  This lab value should
be follow-up to insure resolution.
.
11.) Full Code. Confirmed in NH records and with sister who is
legal guardian.
.
12.) Dispo: The patient was monitored in the intensive care unit
while in the hospital. He was transferred back the the MAC unit
where he was a resident.
.
13.) Access: He had a subclavian central venous catheter placed
for volume resusitation.  He was discharge with PICC line for
the IV antibiotics.
