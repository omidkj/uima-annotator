STUDIES:
[**2127-3-4**] CXR: Global right lung consolidation, probable
pneumonia, conceivably hemorrhage. Volume loss suggests some
bronchial compromise. CT recommended when feasible. ET tube
terminates 3 cm above carina appropriately.

[**2127-3-4**] CT HEAD: 1. No evidence of acute intracranial
abnormalities. 2. Extensive right scalp hematoma and right
facial subcutaneous edema.
