Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for bronchial stent placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy (planned)

History of Present Illness:
75 yo W with COPD (on 3L home O2), tracheo-broncheo-malacia,
multiple past therapeutic bronchoscopies and Y stent
placement/removal in [**2182**] who was transferred form [**Hospital 18222**]
hospital after treatment for an acute episode of SOB/wheezing
and increased WOB for possible tracheal stent with IP.
.
She initially presented to OSH on [**2183-11-17**] with several days of
worsening SOB, DOE, wheezing and was felt to be in "extremis."
Was initially treated for COPD flare, but w/o steroids (received
Roceophin and azithro), however, the next day noted to have
incr. WOB and was transferred to ICU for WOB and non-AG met.
acidosis (bicarb of 20).  with ABG of 7.24/28/186/20 on 100% O2.
She was treated w/ standing nebs/bicitra and ativan/haldol in
addition to above.  Apparently given severe anxiety, was tx w/
IV Precedex. CPAP and BIPAP were tried during ICU stay (reasons
unclear, also unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] one worked best) and she was
eventually started on Prednisone, tapered to 10mg [**Hospital1 **] at time of
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  She completed course of Avelox per transfer
note.
.
Of note, she has had > 6 admissions to [**Hospital1 **] over the past 6
months for similar symptoms, each tx for COPD flare and felt to
be multifactrial: TBM/COPD/VC dysfunction.  She was last d/ced
at beginning of [**Month (only) 359**], however 2wk prior to admission began to
experience incr. wheezing/DOE. She was tx by PCP w/ ABx and
steroids. Intermittent fevers and chills, subjective and chronic
cough, no change in sputum character.  She continues to smoke,
only takes spiriva and pulmicort on a prn basis.
.
While in ICU, her O2 requirement had been decreased to 2L NC w/
94-96%. BPs remained in 116-151 range systolic and HR in 80s.
I/Os were -1.5L for hospital stay.  She was treated with prn
nebs. Prednisone was stopped.  She did not require frequent nebs
(< Q4H).

In addition to above, ROS notable for intermittent chest
tightness, w/o diaphoresis, n/v/radiation.  She reports having
had a negative stress and coronary antio in the past, but does
not recall the time.  She has chronic loose stools, which get
worse whenever she is admitted.  Chronic LBP, unchanged from
prior as well as knee/hip pain, fatigue.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):

OSH pertient results:

CXR [**10/2183**]- Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly
normal. The aortic arch is calcified. Lungs are diffusuely
hyperaerated, with hyperlucency in the apices, and increased
linear markings in both bases.
EKG [**2182-9-30**]-Sinus rhythm. Within normal limits.
CXR [**2182-9-29**]-The heart size is normal. Mediastinal position,
contour and width are unremarkable. Bibasal linear opacities
have slightly improved and might represent interval improvement
in bronchiectasis or bronchial wall inflammation/infection
Bronchoscopy [**8-25**] demonstrated dynamic collapse in the
proximal/distal trachea, the right main stem bronchus, and the
bronchus intermedius, also laryngopharyngeal reflux.
.
PFT's [**8-/2182**]
Mechanics: The FVC and FEV1 are moderately reduced. The FEV1/FVC
ratio is normal. There was no significant change following
inhaled bronchodilator. Flow-Volume Loop: Moderate expiratory
coving with a moderately reduced volume excursion and an early
termination of exhalation. Lung Volumes: The TLC and FRC are
normal. The RV and RV/TLC ratio are elevated. DLCO: The Dsb
corrected for hemoglobin is moderately to markedly reduced.
.
CT trachea w/ forced expiratory maneuver [**11-24**]:
.
IMPRESSION:

1. Distal tracheal narrowing of 53% is borderline for
tracheomalacia.

2. No evidence of bronchomalacia.

3. Diffuse severe emphysema.

4. New bilateral lower lobe bronchial wall thickening suggestive
of small
airways disease. New lower lobe mucous plugging with and
subsegmental
atelectasis at both lung bases.

5. Chronic but not previously seen bilateral rib fractures


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo F with history of COPD (on 2L home O2),
tracheo-broncheo-malacia,multiple past therapeutic
bronchoscopies and Y stent placement and removal in [**2182**]
presenting from a OSH for new stent placement and acute on
chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure.
.
# Acute on Chronic Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient
has a complicated pulmonary history with chronic COPD (continued
smoking), Vocal cord dysfunction and suspected
tacheo-broncheo-malacia.

Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] she was much imroved (3L NC and satting
mid 90s).  The underlying etiology of exacerbations in long term
was felt to be multifactorial: continued smoking, COPD flares in
setting of not using inhalers properly (used pulmicort and
ipratropium prn only), probably dCHF on initial presentation (at
time of [**Hospital1 18**] admission was euvolemic on exam), and suspected
TBM and VC dysfunction.  Based on PFTs as above, it was felt
that most of her disease was due to COPD flares (stage II dz
based on PFTs from [**2182**]).

After 24 hrs in ICU, she was transferred to the floor, on 2L NC.
 CT was performed showing severe emphasema and borderline TBM.
She underwent bronchoscopy showing
supraglottic edema, suggestive of GERD, hematoma at the level of
the left VC and excessive adduction of VCs during ex
