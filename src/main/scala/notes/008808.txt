Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Femoral central line
Arterial line
Internal jugular central line

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of morbid
obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension.  He presented to the
ED today from pulmonary clinic for hypoxia and shortness of
breath.  He was in his usual state of health until 6 days ago
when he developed sore neck and malaise, then low grade fevers
to 100, non-productive cough, and shortness of breath. He was
prescribed Azithromycin 5 days ago and completed the course in
addition to a prednisone taper 30-30-20-20-10-10.  He notes that
as the steroids were tapered his symptoms worsened and he
required home O2 all day.  He did not go to the hospital because
he had an already scheduled pulmonary clinic visit today with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**].  At the clinic he was noted to be hypoxic and was
sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was diagnosed with COPD in [**2152-3-13**] when he was
hospitalized for several weeks for increasing shortness of
breath and a CT scan revealed pulmonary edema, pulmonary
nodules, and severe emphysema.  He was started on Advair, Nebs
and Spiriva and enrolled in pulmonary rehab program.  On [**5-31**] he
had a sleep study and was started on BiPAP (settings 16/6).  At
baseline he now uses 6L supplemental O2 with BiPAP, 2 L O2 with
excercise, but does not use supplemental O2 on a daily basis
when not excercising. Of note, the patient had a recent COPD
flare and was admitted for 2 days to [**Hospital3 4107**] from
[**2063-6-1**].  On [**2152-6-16**], the day he developed his myalgias, he had
f/u CT scan for his pulmonary nodules that showed extensive
centrilobular emphysema, resolution of all but one pulmonary
nodules, and some ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, that
could represent inflammatory process or recurrent aspiration.
.
Presention to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED today revealed initial vs: T 100.0 P
80  BP 147/88  R 22 O2 91% NRB. He was noted to be unable to
finish sentences and hypoxic.  Breath sounds were decreased
bilaterally.  A CXR showed bilateral Lower Lobe PNA. He was
initially placed on BiPAP for presumed COPD flare, with variable
effect, then placed on a nonrebreather and his saturations
remained at 96%.  WBC was elevated at 18.  He was given 1 dose
750 mg levaquin and 1 gm ceftriaxone, nebs, and 125 mg IV
solumedrol.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU vs were: HR 110  169/88   RR 21   Sat
87% on 8 L nonrebreather.  He was wearing the non-rebreather and
was able to speak in complete sentences although he looked like
he was in mild distress.  He was slightly tremulous.  ROS + for
subjective fever, recent epistaxis and hemoptysis in setting of
using home O2 as wll as some chest tightness.  ROS was negative
for diarrhea, constipaiton, rash, anorexia, dysuria, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting.

IMAGING:
[**2152-6-24**] Chest CT
FINDINGS: Compared to prior CT of [**2152-6-16**], there has been
interval
development of multifocal areas of ground-glass opacity and
nodular areas of consolidation within both lungs, predominantly
within the lower lobes. Patchy areas of ground-glass opacity and
nodular foci are noted within the posterior aspect of the
lingula and also within the right middle lobe. These opacities
appear to spare the periphery within the bilateral lower lobes
and right middle lobe. Diffuse severe centrilobular emphysema is
again identified. A stable right upper lobe triangular opacity
is again noted most likely represents an intrapulmonary lymph
node or small area of atelectasis. No pleural effusions are
identified. The tracheobronchial tree is patent to level of the
subsegmental bronchi bilaterally.
The heart is normal in size. Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph
nodes are
identified, some of which are slightly enlarged compared to the
prior study.  Specifically, there is a precarinal lymph node
currently measuring 13 mm and measuring 9 mm on the prior study.
Multiple other prominent mediastinal lymph nodes in the
pretracheal, prevascular space and AP window are again
identified. No pericardial effusion is identified. A healed
right seventh rib fracture is again noted. No new osseous
fractures are identified. There are no suspicious lytic or
sclerotic lesions noted. Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate
a normal-appearing liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas.

IMPRESSION:
Multifocal diffuse ground-glass and nodular opacities noted
predominantly
within the bilateral lower lobes and the right middle lobe which
have
developed since prior CT of [**2152-6-16**]. These findings are
highly
concerning for infection. However, aspiration cannot be excluded
and clinical correlation is recommended.

Echo [**2152-6-26**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
