Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, transfer for STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-1-1**] Cardiac Cath
[**2142-1-4**] Coronary artery bypass grafting x4, with the left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery
and reversed saphenous vein grafts to the posterior descending
artery and first and second diagonal arteries.

History of Present Illness:
76 year old male who presented to OSH for ED with sudden onset
of [**9-19**] chest pressure, similar to prior chest pain. Attempted
to fall asleep however could not and so called EMS who brought
him to [**Hospital3 **]. At OSH, EKG revealed ST elevations in
anterior leads. Pt was started heparin gtt and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] emergently for further evaluation. Code STEMI was called
after EKG showed ~2mm ST elevations in V3-V4. Labs were
significant for mild troponin of 0.09. He was found to have two
vessel disease and he is now being referred to cardiac surgery
for revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2142-1-1**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this
right dominant system demonstrated two vessel CAD. The LMCA was
patent. The LAD had diffuse plaquing throughout and tapers to
90% beyond the patent proximal to mid LAD stent and the D2
takeoff. The D2 is diffusely diseased with 40% at ostium and 50%
proximally. The D1 is a substantive bifricating vessel with 70%
ostial stenosis (partially jailed by the LAD stent). The LCx had
mild plaquing throughout. The proximal OM1 and mid OM2 (both
small vessels) have focal 70% stenosis with normal flow. The RCA
was subselectively engaged due to ostial stent and
calcifications. The ostial stent was patent with instent
restenosis (mild, nonflow-limiting). Serial focal stenosis (1st
65-70%) just beyond the acute marginal takeoff and second (90%)
about 2 cm downstream. The PL has 70-80% ostially but overall
this is a small diffusely diseased vessel. The R-PDA is patent.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated
systemic arterial systolic pressures with an SBP of 150 mmHg. 3.
Abdominal aortography was performed using a pigtail catheter via
power injection and showed diffuse plaquing in the infra-renal
aorta, possible moderate L renal artery stenosis, calcific right
common iliac artery stenosis (difficulty passing the wire
through the common iliac into the aorta).
.
[**2142-1-3**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA no
stenosis.
.
[**2142-1-4**] Echo: Pre-CPB: The patient is in A.Fib. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). In
the face of more modest peak and mean gradients across the
valve, a discussion led to the decision to not replace it. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4901**] offered his opinion also. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Post-CPB: The patient is on an AV-Pacer, though there
is no atrial response. No inotropes. Preserved biventricular
systolic fxn. 1+MR, trace AI. Aorta intact.

PICC line [**2141-1-7**]:
Right jugular line has been removed. Tip of the new right PIC
line is in the right atrium. It should be withdrawn 3.5 cm to
position it low in the SVC.
Mild pulmonary edema has developed, most readily appreciated in
the right
lower lung. Severe cardiomegaly is longstanding, but mediastinal
and hilar
vascular engorgements have worsened. There is greater
consolidation at the
left lung base, presumably atelectasis though pneumonia is not
excluded, and an increase in small-to-moderate left pleural
effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.

CXR: [**2142-1-6**] There is a questionable tiny left pneumothorax.
The pulmonary edema has almost resolved. There are persistent
low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged. Right IJ catheter remains low in the
right atrium and can be withdrawn 3-4 cm for more standard
position. If any there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
The sternal wires are aligned.


Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 47059**] was transferred from
outside hospital with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He
underwent a cardiac cath on [**1-1**] which revealed severe three
vessel coronary artery disease. He then underwent appropriate
surgical work-up while awaiting Plavix to wash-out. On [**1-4**] he
was brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 4. Please see operative note for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CIVCU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
