[**2193-12-30**] - ECHO
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
2.No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

3.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. No left ventricular
aneurysm is seen. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with global hypokinesis
especially of the anterior and inferoseptal walls.. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
4.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5.There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
6.There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2).  Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral
valve
leaflets do not fully coapt. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral
valve. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
jet is
central. There annulus is not dilated. There is bileaflet
retraction with
moderate MAC.

POST-CPB: Pt is on epinephrine infusion. Well-seated
bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position with no mitral
regurgitation seen. LVEF now 40% on
inotropic support. Aortic valve now measures 1.9 cm2 , improved
from pre-cpb. Mild AS trace AI.

[**2195-1-1**] CXR:
There has been interval removal of a left-sided chest tube as
well as interval removal of a nasogastric tube and removal of a
Swan-Ganz catheter, with the right internal jugular sheath
remaining in place. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The
mediastinal contours appear improved, but with a persistent
postoperative appearance. No region of consolidation is seen.
Pulmonary vascularity appears improved since the prior study.
The right costophrenic angle has been excluded from the film.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 29293**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2194-12-30**] for surgical
management of her mitral valve and [**Date Range **] artery disease. She
was taken to the operating room where she underwent [**Date Range **]
artery bypass grafting to three vessels and a mitral valve
replacement using a 27mm mosaic porcine valve. Postoperatively
she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. Beta blockade and aspirin were
resumed. On postoperative day two, she was transferred to the
step down unit for further recovery. She was gently diuresed
towards her preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with he postoperative strength and
mobility. [**1-2**]
Ms. [**Known lastname 29293**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged to
rehab on postoperative day #6. She will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1290**], her cardiologist and her primary care physician as an
outpatient.
