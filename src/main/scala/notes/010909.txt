female patient with a history of fatigue and epigastric
discomfort for approximately one year.  Symptoms have been
increasing with activity.  She denies lightheadedness or
syncope.  Diagnosed to have aortic stenosis by
echocardiogram.  Underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2200-7-18**], which revealed normal coronary arteries and severe
aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 100 mm Hg, a mean
gradient of 60, and aortic valve area of 0.7 cm squared.  She
is referred for aortic valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Status post hysterectomy.

Status post cholecystectomy.

Status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Amaryl 4 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Metformin 1000 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Actos 45 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lescol 30 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.


ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Alcohol intake occasional and nonsmoker.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unremarkable with the exception of
history of present illness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA:  Unremarkable laboratory values with the
exception of a preoperative creatinine of 1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
the morning of [**2200-7-28**], where she was taken to the
operating room and she underwent an aortic valve replacement
with a number 21 mm Magna tissue valve replacement.
Postoperatively, she was transported from the operating room
to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on IV propofol drip in
good condition.  She was in normal sinus rhythm with stable
vital signs.  She was weaned from mechanical ventilator and
extubated on the night of surgery.

Patient had some marginal hypoxia in the initial
postoperative period.  Otherwise, remained hemodynamically
stable.  Her chest tubes were discontinued on postoperative
day one and she was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit
to the telemetry floor on postoperative day two in good
condition.  Her epicardial wires were subsequently
discontinued.  [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes consult was obtained to assist
with diabetes management.  Initially, their recommendation
was to resume all of her preoperative oral hypoglycemic
agents, which was done.  However, the patient still continued
to have requirement of sliding scale insulin coverage.

Patient continued to progress with rehabilitation to increase
her mobility, although she did have an oxygen requirement and
complained of dyspnea with any sort of exertion.  She
received IV Lasix for an additional 24 hours with some
improvement in her complaints of dyspnea as well as a bit of
a decrease in her O2 requirement.  She has since been
converted back to oral Lasix at this time, and felt stable to
be discharged to rehabilitation facility.

On followup by the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes service, it was their
recommendation to add Lantus insulin coverage at bedtime 15
units as well as increase her metformin dose and she should
be followed as an outpatient for aggressive therapy and
diabetes management.  Patient has remained hemodynamically
stable and ready to be discharged to rehabilitation facility
today, postoperative day nine.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. for five days.
3. In addition, potassium chloride 10 mEq two tablets p.o.
   q.d. for five days and the need for diuresis should be
   monitored at that point to see if she requires further
   diuresis.  It is also recommended that she have her
   electrolytes checked on [**8-7**], two days from now
   because of a slight increase in her creatinine, which had
   been running in the 1.2 to 1.3 range, went up to 1.4
   today.  However, this was her preoperative, but this
   should also be followed while she is in rehab.
4. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Tylenol 325 mg p.o. q.4h prn.
8. Percocet 5/325 p.o. q.4h prn pain.
9. Metformin 1 gram b.i.d.
10.      Amaryl 4 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11.      Lantus insulin 15 units subQ q.h.s.
12.      Avandia 45 mg p.o. q.d.
13.      Bactrim DS one p.o. b.i.d. for one additional dose,
   this is to complete a course of preoperative urinary tract
   infection, which was initially resistant to Cipro.
14.      Fluvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.


FOLLOW UP:  The patient should follow up with her primary
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4469**] in approximately 1-2 weeks and
she should follow up with her primary care physician to
continue with diabetes management and in also 1-2 weeks, she
should also follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately one
month for postoperative check.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Aortic stenosis status post aortic
valve replacement.

Diabetes type 2.


DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.
