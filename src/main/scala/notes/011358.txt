Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
progressive dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart cath
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 111334**] is a 56 year old woman with a history of severe
dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of [**10-24**]% (?viral vs
post-partum) s/p ICD placement who was admitted on [**2112-2-23**] for
severe shortness of breath and PND, presumably due to worsening
congestive heart failure. Given the lack of edema or hypoxia,
the patient was continued on her home regimen fo torsemide 30mg
PO QAM and 10mg PO QPM. Notable findings during her stay
included a BNP >4000 (baseline of 1000), trigger for severe
dyspnea/orthopnea, and an echo that showed profoundly worsened
EF now down to 5% from 10-15%, with severe dilation of the LV.
At the behest of her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], she underwent a
right heart cath with plans for a trial of milrinone therapy.
RHC revealed markedly elevated left and right heart filling
pressures that significantly improved with milrinone infusion.
If this milrinone trial fails, she would likely be transferred
to [**Hospital1 3278**] for a heart transplant evaluation.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient subjectively felt much better
after milrinone infusion. She had by that point made nearly
700cc of urine.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ICD in [**2108-9-14**].
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

mild restriction on PFTs
- status post cholecystectomy, status post appendectomy, two
C-sections
- remote asthma and multiple allergies
- anxiety
- ovarian cysts
- Lyme disease seeing specialists in [**State 531**].

Social History:
[**Known firstname **] is married, lives with her husband and has two daughters.
She smoked cigarettes in her 20s and has not smoked tobacco
since. Occasional wine.


Family History:
Father died suddenly at age 74. She reports he may have had a
heart attack and had diabetes near the end of his life. Mother
is alive and fairly healthy.

STUDIES:
.
CXR ([**2112-2-23**]): PA and lateral views of the chest are compared to
previous exam from [**2111-8-10**]. Again seen is cardiomegaly
which is essentially stable from prior. The lungs remain clear.
There is a small left pleural effusion. Pacemaker wires are in
stable position. There are surgical clips in the upper abdomen,
potentially from prior cholecystectomy.
IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion. Stable cardiomegaly.
.
RIGHT HEART CATH ([**2112-2-24**]):
1.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated filling
pressures
with a mean PCPW of 39mmHg and an RVEDP of 25mmHg.  There was
severe
pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 71/41mmHg.  Cardiac
output
was diminished at 2.4L/min with an index of 1.3L/min/m2.
2.  Following milrinone bolus and infusion of 0.5mcg/kg/min,
PCWP
decreased to mean of 30mmHg.  PA pressure fell to 60/42mmHg, and
cardiac
output increased to 3.4L/min with an index of 1.9L/min/m2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe right- and left-sided heart failure with elevated
filling
pressures at rest.
2. Positive response to milrinone infusion with decrease in PA
pressure,
PCWP, and increase in cardiac output.
.
ECHO ([**2112-2-24**]):
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is profoundly depressed (LVEF= 5 %). The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. AT LEAST
moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing from the ICD coil, the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared to the prior study of [**2111-4-20**], the left
ventricular ejection fraction is even further reduced, and now
severe right ventricular contractile dysfunction is present,
with markedly increased tricuspid regurgitation and at least
moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
LENIs ([**2112-2-24**]): Normal appearance of the deep venous structures
of the right and left lower extremities. No evidence of deep
venous thrombosis.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2112-2-25**] 7:30
AM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has received a right internal jugular vein device, in addition
to the left pacemaker.
The size of the cardiac silhouette is still substantially
enlarged and the
presence of a small pleural effusion on the left cannot be
excluded.
Otherwise, there are signs of minimal fluid overload but no
overt pulmonary edema with no evidence of pneumonia. Unchanged
retrocardiac atelectasis.

The right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
