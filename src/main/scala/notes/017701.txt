Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 yo F w/hx polysubstance abuse who presents
after being found unresponsive at home, likely [**3-12**] substance
abuse, now improved after Narcan administration.  Hospital
course by problem:
.
#. Unresponsiveness. Most likely etiology for episode of
unresponsiveness is narcotics overdose, with reversal with
Narcan. Pt has a significant substance abuse history, and tox
screen is positive for both cocaine and opiates on admission.
We monitored her in the ICU and she returned to her baseline.
We obtained a social work consult and screened her for
placement.  This event occurred within four hours of your
discharge from rehab so feel it is safest for you to return to a
rehab.
.
#. Aspiration pneumonitis. Patient with evidence of aspiration
pneumonitis on CXR, likely from episode of being down on at
home. Patient also on pureed diets at discharge from rehab,
possibly due to hx of esophageal dysmotility.  We monitored her
oxygen requirement.  She remained at her normal requirement of
2L NC so did not start antibiotics.
