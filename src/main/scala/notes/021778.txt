ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Severe mitral valve, severe mitral
regurgitation and aortic stenosis, as well as aortic
regurgitation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old female
with a history of rheumatic heart disease status post mitral
valve replacement x2, the most recent one being in [**2150**]; it
was a porcine valve.  She also has a history of atrial
fibrillation with a VVI pacemaker in place, as well as
diabetes mellitus, pulmonary hypertension and aortic
regurgitation with mild aortic stenosis which was diagnosed
in [**2156**] by an echocardiogram.  She presented on [**4-20**] with
worsening dyspnea on exertion for five days.  She had no
associated chest pain, cough, palpitations.  She had no
difficulty getting air.  She had no pedal edema, no fevers,
no new medications.  The dyspnea on exertion suddenly
worsened five days prior to admission, such that she could
only walk a few feet before getting short of breath,
previously could walk around the block.  She denied any
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She had a gastrointestinal
bleed several months prior to admission and received four
units of packed red blood cells.  She did state that she had
had recent dark stools.  In the Emergency Department on the
day of admission, she was with a stable blood pressure of
103/42, heart rate of 77, saturating 97% on room air which
would decrease to the low 90s with ambulation.

ALLERGIES:  She had no known drug allergies.

The patient was admitted to the medicine service where it was
felt that she had worsening aortic regurgitation, as well as
mitral regurgitation leading to these symptoms.  Here she
underwent a work up which included an echocardiogram that
demonstrated a mildly dilated left atrium with mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy and an overall left ventricular
ejection fraction of 55%.  The aortic valve leaflets were
moderately thickened with moderate aortic valve stenosis and
mild to moderate 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation.  A
bioprosthetic mitral valve was also seen that demonstrated
thickened leaflets with at least modest mitral regurgitation
without significant stenosis.  Based on comparison with prior
echocardiogram, this mitral regurgitation, as well as
increase in the pulmonary artery systolic pressure were
significantly changed from prior studies.  She also underwent
a cardiac catheterization on [**4-22**] that was significant
for the following:

Normal coronaries in a right dominant system, 3+ mitral
regurgitation and moderate to severely stenosed aortic valve
with a mean gradient of 30 across the valve, as well as
severe primary pulmonary hypertension.  The patient was
further worked up with a Persantine stress test, as well as
adjustment in her anticoagulation.  A cardiac surgery consult
was called.  In the meantime, she had a tooth extraction and
on [**4-29**], she underwent a mitral valve replacement with
porcine valve, as well as an aortic valve replacement with
pericardial tissue valve.  The patient did well
postoperatively and was extubated on postoperative day #4.
Her cardiac index at the time was 2.97 and she had a good
blood pressure, heart rate, urine output.  However, she
failed the extubation and had to be reintubated for
respiratory acidosis and respiratory distress.  She was
re-extubated on postoperative day #6 again and did well after
extubation.  At this point, she was off any pressor
medications and she was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day #7.  At this point, she was placed on a
regular diet, however she did have some problems with
swallowing.

Also of note, she was in an irregularly irregular rhythm
despite having a VVI pacer.  She had EPS combined and target
the VVI pacer prior to removal of the pacer wires.  This
showed normal function of the pacer.  The patient was also
given a trial of clear fluids and slowly advanced to a
regular diet.  She was also replaced on Coumadin
anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation.  On
postoperative day #11, [**5-10**], she was hemodynamically
stable with a rate in the 90s and a blood pressure in the
120s/60s to 70s.  She was making good urine output of over a
liter per day.  She was clear to auscultation with a
sternotomy wound that showed no evidence of drainage or
infection.  Her heart rate was irregularly irregular.  She
was tolerating a regular diet on oral pain medications and it
was felt that she was stable for discharge to rehabilitation.
She is being sent to rehabilitation because of poor balance,
high fall risk and difficulty with activities of daily
living.  She was transferred to the rehabilitation on the
following medications:

1.  Motrin 400 to 600 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn
2.  Tylenol 650 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn
3.  Coumadin 5 mg po qd, just to an INR between 2 to 3
4.  Sliding scale insulin
5.  Xalatan 0.005% one drop to the right eye
6.  Artificial Tears bilaterally
7.  Azopt 1 drop to the left eye

DIET:  Diabetic diet

FOLLOW UP:  She was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in
four weeks.
