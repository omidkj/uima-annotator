HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old
female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction
and questionable history of lung carcinoma who was
transferred from her nursing home on [**8-24**] with a
home referral form, the patient had a week of increasing
shortness of breath and productive cough of clear sputum
prior to her presentation at this hospital.  She has been
afebrile with O2 saturations ranging from 89% to 95% on her
usual home O2 requirement of 3 liters.  Today, the patient
was noted to be very lethargic and weak, saturating from 79%
to 84% on 3 liters.  She was transferred to [**Doctor First Name **]
to the Emergency Room, the patient was noted to be in
respiratory failure with an arterial blood gas of
7.14/143/81.  She was given nitropaste, morphine and Lasix
for congestive heart failure and eventually started on
nitroglycerin GTT.  Although the patient is clearly defined
as a DNR/DNI, the patient was treated with BIPAP on the last
admission and thus started on BIPAP this admission as well.
Unfortunately, the patient's arterial blood gas did not
respond well to the treatment and the BIPAP remained at
7.17/128/86.  The patient was started on Solu-Medrol for
possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation,
Levaquin and Flagyl for likely postobstructive disease versus
aspiration pneumonia and transferred to the MICU.  She
arrived in the MICU with an O2 saturation of 90% on 100%
nonrebreather.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
2.  Hypertension
3.  Hypercholesterolemia
4.  Status post resection of benign esophageal tumor
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease
6.  Euthyroid goiter
7.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction
8.  History of lung carcinoma, possibly no diagnostic
biopsies or cytology
9.  Status post total abdominal hysterectomy

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Verapamil 240 mg [**Hospital1 **]
2.  Serevent 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **]
3.  Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers q6h
4.  Lasix 80 mg q a.m., 40 mg q p.m.
5.  Azmacort 4 puffs tid
6.  Megace 800 mg q day
7.  Prilosec 20 mg q day
8.  KCL 40 milliequivalents q day

ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS A QUESTIONABLE SENSITIVITY TO
CODEINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Nursing Home
and son is
involved in decision making.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96??????, blood pressure 177/71, pulse
83, respirations 26, O2 saturations 92% on 100%
nonrebreather.
GENERAL:  The patient is an alert, cooperative, elderly
female in mild to moderate respiratory distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  The patient has cataracts
bilaterally.  Oropharynx exam is notable for thrush.
NECK:  Supple with a JVP of 8 cm.
LUNGS:  Significant for extremely coarse breath sounds
bilaterally with bibasilar crackles.
HEART:  Significant for muffled heart sounds and difficult to
appreciate given the claim of the breath sounds.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normal abdominal
bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Without any edema.  There is decreased distal
pulses on the right.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  The patient's motor exam
was nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's Emergency Room course was as
described above in the history of present illness.  An
electrocardiogram was obtained in the Emergency Room which
showed elevated T-waves in the V2 to V4 leads consistent with
prior electrocardiograms and no acute ST or T-wave changes.
A chest x-ray showed progression of right middle lobe and
right lower lobe opacification with obscuration of the right
heart border and right diaphragm, likely right effusion
compared with the previous film from [**2155-4-29**].

The patient was initially admitted to the MICU.  It was
thought that the patient's respiratory failure was likely
multifactorial with pneumonia, congestive heart failure and
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The patient
was treated on Levaquin and Flagyl for the pneumonia.
Cultures were sent and were negative at time of discharge.
The patient was also started on intravenous Solu-Medrol q8h
80 mg and albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers around the clock.
The patient was placed on 100% nonrebreather in the MICU with
saturations in the low 90s.  The patient's O2 was weaned with
a goal O2 in the mid 80s and low 90s.  The patient was given
Lasix 100 mg intravenous in the Emergency Room as stated
above and in the MICU an additional dose of 100 mg
intravenous was given to fix the possible congestive heart
failure.  The patient steadily improved in the MICU and was
transferred out to the floor on [**2155-8-25**].  The plan
was to continue the supportive care while continuing
treatment of her pneumonia, but not to restart BIPAP or
resuscitate or intubate this patient if she were to
decompensate.  On the floor, antibiotics were continued, as
well as the Solu-Medrol.

At the time of discharge, the patient had received four days
of levofloxacin and Flagyl and was recently started on
prednisone to be tapered at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The patient
required less and less oxygen and at time of discharge was
requiring only 3 to 4 liters by face mask with an O2
saturation in the low 90s.  According to her history, this is
fairly close to her baseline.  Her lung exam at the time of
discharge is still extremely junky and the patient's
bicarbonate at the time of discharge is still elevated at 35.
It is likely that the patient still has a respiratory
acidosis secondary to CO2 retention and a compensating
metabolic alkalosis, but an arterial blood gas was not
indicated at this time, as the patient had been
symptomatically improving.  The patient is felt to be stable
and will be discharged to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for further
management.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for further management.  The patient will be continued
on DNR/DNI status, but will continue to receive the full 14
day course of antibiotics.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Aspiration pneumonia versus
postobstructive pneumonia
