History of Present Illness:
52yo male presented to [**Hospital 19135**] Hospital s/p motorcycle vs car
collision. The pt was traveling at a high rate of speed, swerved
and fell. + LOC. He and his motorcycle were found in the middle
[**Male First Name (un) **] of the road. He was wearing a helmet. At [**Hospital1 **], he was
alert and oriented x 2. Multiple facial lacerations were noted
and a tetanus shot was given. Vitals upon presentation to
[**Hospital1 **] were BP 174/101, HR 80, RR 20, 100% on RA. Pelvis,
chest, and C-spine [**Last Name (un) 22942**] were unremarkable. He was transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Prior to transfer an ECG had been
obtained which showed inferior ST elevations. He was taken to
the cath lab. He was intubated using laryngoscopy due to airway
swelling. Cath showed thrombotic mid-distal RCA lesion which was
stented with BMS x 2. He was then transfered to the CCU. U tox
came back + for cocaine. Plastic surgery evaluated and sutured
facial lacs. Trauma surgery is folllowing the patient along with
CCU team.

Other Notable Labs:
[**2159-6-7**]: HbA1c 6/0
[**2159-6-7**]: ALT 35, AST 44, AlkPhos 55, TBili 0.7, Albumin 2.9
[**2159-5-29**]: TSH 3.0, T4 5.1, Free T4 0.88

Discharge Labs [**2159-6-11**]:
WBC 6.7, HCT 36.1, Plt 428
Na 141, K 4.7, Cl 107, HCO3 26, BUN 15, Cr 0.9, Glucose 110
Ca 8.4, Mag 2.1, Phos 4.3
PT 14.4, PTT 26.3, INR 1.2

Admission ECG [**2159-5-24**]:
Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2153-3-20**] there
is ST segment elevation in the inferolateral leads and ST
segment depression in the anteroseptal leads suggesting acute
myocardial infarction of the inferolateral territory.

Repeat ECG [**2159-5-24**]: Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
Probably mid-right coronary lesion with ST segment depression in
lead aVL and aVR being negative. ST segment elevation in lead
III greater than in lead II. A-V dissociation is not present.
There is some irregularity to the rhythm suggesting capture
beats. This may be interference dissociation with a junctional
rhythm that is rapid. Since the previous tracing of [**2159-5-24**]
junctional rhythm is present with interference dissociation.

Admission CXR [**2159-5-24**]: Low inspiratory lung volumes, but
otherwise no acute
cardiopulmonary process.

Cardiac Cath [**2159-5-24**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had no
angiographically apparent disease. The Cx had no
angiographically apparent disease. The RCA had a proximal 50%
stenosis as well as a distal 70% stenosis that was thrombotic
and ulcerated. The distal RCA stenosis was located proximal to
the PL/PDA bifurcation.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of distal RCA with a 4.5x28mm
Vision BMS
postdilated to 5.0mm.
3. Successful PCI of proximal PL with 5.0x18 Ultra stent.
4. Airway compromise from trauma requiring fiberoptic intubation
by
anesthesia staff.
5. Unsuccessful PTCA of distal PL cutoff with 2.5mm balloon.
6. Successful rescue PTCA of PDA origin with 2.0x15mm Apex
balloon.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. STEMI
3. Successful PCI distal RCA.
3. Successful PCI proximal PL.
4. Unsuccessful PTCA of distal PL cutoff.
5. Successful rescue PTCA of PDA origin.
6. Successful fiberoptic intubation by anesthesia staff for
airway
protection.

CT Head w/o Contrast [**2159-5-24**]: No acute intracranial abnormality
CT C-spine w/o Contrast [**2159-5-24**]: No evidence of acute fracture or
malalignment of the cervical spine.

CT Sinus/Mandidble/Maxillofacial Non-Contrast [**2159-5-24**]: Multiple
facial fractures are seen involving the bilateral nasal bones,
bilateral maxillary sinuses (anterior, lateral, posterior and
medial walls), the right palatine process of the maxilla and
palatine bone, bilateral
pterygoid plates, bilateral frontal processes of the maxillae,
right lateral orbital wall and right orbital floor.  The globes
appear intact. No extraocular muscle herniation is seen. The
bilateral lamina papyracea are intact. Blood is seen throughout
the bilateral maxillary sinuses, ethmoid air cells, sphenoid
sinuses and frontal sinuses.  Soft tissue swelling and hematoma
is seen in the frontal scalp along with
subcutaneous emphysema extending to the right periorbital region
and along the right cheek. Subcutaneous emphysema extends to the
masticator space
bilaterally, right greater than left. The globes appear intact.
No
mandibular fracture is seen. IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral
facial fractures with involvement of the right lateral orbital
wall and floor as described above. The globes appear intact and
no evidence of ocular muscle entrapment is seen.

CT Abdomen and Pelvis with Contrast [**2159-5-24**]: 1. No acute
traumatic injuries seen within the torso. 2. Left adrenal
nodule, which does not meet criteria for an adrenal adenoma on
this exam. Further evaluatio
