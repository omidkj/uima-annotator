History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with strept viridans
mitral valve endocarditis who has completed his 6 weeks
treatment
with antibiotics. Follow up TEE was performed on [**3-30**]. TEE shows
partial [**Month/Year (2) 37169**] leaflet flail with moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. Also notable for small mass on [**Month/Year (2) 8813**] valve.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] has been following  Mr.[**Known lastname 37170**] progression and the
pt has been seen in clinic to discuss plans for surgical
correction/timing of his mitral valve. He presents for cardiac
cath today, preop MVR, and coronary artery, single vessel
disease
was revealed.


Past Medical History:
Endocarditis - Strept. Viridans
moderate mitral regurgitation,MVP, myxomatous leaflets

Pertinent Results:
[**2191-4-22**] Intra-op Echo:
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be
reliably assessed due to severe MR.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve leaflets. The [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a probable
[**Month/Day/Year **] on the [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve. There are filamentous strands on
the [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal
variant). There is no [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve stenosis. Trace [**Month/Day/Year 8813**]
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Torn mitral
chordae are present. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect).
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. Sinus rhythm.
Well-seated annuloplasty ring in the mitral position. No MR, no
MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is no longer visible post bypass. AI
remains trace. Biventricular systolic function is preserved.
[**Last Name (Titles) **] contour is normal post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2191-4-22**] where
the patient underwent Mitral Valve repair, CABG x 1, and
resection of [**Date Range 8813**] leaflet mass with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility. All OR
cultures were negative at the time of discharge and it was
determined that no antibiotics were needed. By the time of
discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home with VNA services in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
