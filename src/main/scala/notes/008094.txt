ADDENDUM
NOTE:  The following is an addendum to the previous discharge
summary as dictated on [**2111-7-11**], by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, this is an unfortunate
64-year-old man who suffered a ventricular fibrillation
arrest, found down for 10 to 15 minutes, resulting in severe
anoxic brain injury with no hope of functional recovery.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 41763**] remained in-house until [**2111-7-22**].  His hospital
course includes a successful tracheostomy with successful
discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.  His respiratory
status continued to improve throughout the remainder of the
hospital course, requiring only intermittent suctioning by
our nursing staff.

From an infectious disease perspective, the patient was being
treated for group B beta hemolytic streptococcus, Klebsiella,
and gram-negative rods cultured from sputum.  However, he
developed a rash to the aztreonam, which was begun by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], and therefore, per the recommendation of Infectious
Disease, was changed over to intravenous gentamicin.  The
patient subsequently completed a course of oxacillin,
gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin for his various infections.
However, three days prior to discharge, the patient developed
a temperature to 104.  At this time, he was cultured from
blood, sputum and urine, and these cultures have been no
growth to date.  The decision has been made not to treat the
patient until we have definitive culture positive bacterial
growth.  The patient has been afebrile for 36 hours as of the
time of this dictation.

With regard to his neurologic status, there has been no
improvement since the last dictation.  The patient remains
unresponsive to his environment, and has random eye movements
but responds inconsistently to pain.  In addition, he does
not have the usual reflexes that one would expect of someone
who can respond to one's environment.  Taken together, these
clinical findings force us to conclude that the chance of
functional recovery in this patient is nearly zero.  This
information has been relayed to the patient's family so that
they may make decisions which Mr. [**Known lastname 41763**] would have made were
he able to make them himself.

A family meeting one day prior to discharge made clear that,
in our medical judgment, Mr. [**Known lastname 41763**] had virtually no hope of
a neurologic recovery.  Therefore, it is the patient's and
family's wish to remain at this time Do Not Resuscitate/Do
Not Intubate and do not use pressors.  The family also is in
agreement that the use of antibiotics would not be
appropriate at this time for Mr. [**Known lastname 41763**].  We further
discussed the ethically appropriate decision to discontinue
tube feeds, and the patient will consider this possibility
upon transfer to [**Hospital1 2670**] at [**Hospital1 189**].  For the time being,
they understand and wish for us to focus on Mr. [**Known lastname 41764**]
comfort as the paramount goal.

At the time of transfer, the patient is clinically stable,
however, remains completely unresponsive from a neurologic
perspective.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Neurologically unresponsive, with no
hope of functional recovery.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to [**Hospital1 2670**] at [**Hospital1 189**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Ventricular fibrillation asystolic cardiac arrest with
resultant severe anoxic brain injury
2.  Anoxic brain injury resulting in no response to external
stimuli, without hope of meaningful functional recovery

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg by mouth twice a day
2.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once daily
3.  Furosemide 20 mg by mouth twice a day
4.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq by mouth twice a day
5.  Prevacid oral solution 30 mg by mouth twice a day
6.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 12 hours
7.  Fentanyl patch 50 mcg every 72 hours
8.  Albuterol one to two puffs every four hours as needed
9.  NPH insulin 12 units subcutaneously every morning and
every evening
10. Insulin sliding scale as per attached sheet, but briefly,
use regular insulin sliding scale for a blood glucose from 0
to 150, give 1 unit of regular insulin; from 151 to 200, give
3; from 201 to 250, give 5; from 251 to 300, give 7; from 301
to 350, give 9; from 351 to 400, give 11; from greater than
400, give 13 and call physician.
11. Lacrilube ointment apply to both eyes as needed
12. Artificial tears one to two drops to both eyes as needed
13. Acetaminophen 650 mg by mouth every four to six hours as
needed for fever
14. If percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube clots,
consider using Viokase one tablet mixed in 325 mg of
bicarbonate in 5 cc of water, clamp for five minutes, and
then flush with 50 cc of water.
15. Tube feeds with ProMod with fiber 65 cc/hour
Note:  The patient's family desires continued tube feeds and
medications for the time being, but will consider
discontinuation of tube feeds when at [**Hospital1 189**].

NOTE:  We would like to reiterate the importance of
emphasizing the patient's comfort, given the clinical
situation.  The family is aware and wish that we focus on his
comfort.  He is not to be resuscitated, not to be
mechanically ventilated, and not to receive pressors.  At the
time being, the patient's family also agrees that antibiotics
would not be indicated.  They will consider discontinuation
of tube feeds upon transfer to [**Hospital1 2670**] at [**Hospital1 189**].

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the care of
this very unfortunate 64-year-old.  Our thoughts are with his
family.
