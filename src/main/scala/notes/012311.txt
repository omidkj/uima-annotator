Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4309**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint:  shortness of breath
Reason for MICU transfer:  hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
81F w/hx osteoporosis, recurrent [**First Name3 (LF) **] UTIs, HTN, parkinsonian
features and depression with recent admission for pna/uti
requiring ICU admission now p/w new oxygen requirement in rehab
earlier today.

The patient reports 2-3 days of progressive shortness of breath
such that today she was unable to read.  She reports subjective
fevers (unrecorded) and chills in addition to an associated
productive cough of white/green sputum.  Her symptoms are worse
in comparison to her recent admission for pneumonia.  She denies
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations.

[**Hospital 100**] Rehab called EMS who found her with O2 sats in the low
80s which improved to the mid 90s on a NRB.

Of note the patient was admitted in early [**Month (only) 116**] for pneumonia and
urinary tract infection requiring ICU stay. She initialy
presented with hypoxia and leukocytosis with bibasilar
opacities. She was treated originally with CTX/azithro/Flagyl
switched to Vanc/Cefepime and ultimately discharged on an 8 day
course of levofloxacin. Her urinalysis was concerning for a UTI
but culture data was ultimately unremarkable and [**Month (only) **] swab
negative.  Her course was complicated by abdominal pain and LLQ
abdominal pain initially concerning for diverticulitis. She was
empricially started on flagyl and CT abdomen revealed no
evidence of intrabdominal process.

In the ED, initial VS were:  100 103 168/70 24 92% 15L
Non-Rebreather.  Initial exam revealed a tachypneic female,
alert x [**12-25**]. She was able to report her own symptoms but was
very short of breath. Labs demonstrated a lactate 1.7, troponin
<0.01, creatinine 0.6, BNP 1588 and WBC of 20.5  A chest xray
demonstrated bilateral opacities superimposed on known lung
scars concerning for a pneumonia.  She was given vancomycin and
levofloxacin.  Attempts at weaning her oxygen were not tolerated
with desaturations to the low 80s.  She appeared comfortable on
15L NRB therefore Bipap was not pursued.  She confirmed her code
status was DNR/I. She had 2 PIV. Vitals on transfer were: 105
150s/80s, 24-26, 94% on NRB and afebrile.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient complained of some shortness
of breath but improved from prior to coming in. VS: 98.5,
123/96, 90, 17, 93% on 5LNC

Studies
CXR [**2142-6-9**]
FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to
previous exam from [**2142-5-1**].  When compared to prior, there
has been partial resolution of the bilateral parenchymal
opacities seen on prior.  There is however persistent left
basilar opacity.  Both could be due to atelectasis, aspiration
or infection is also possible.  Blunting of the right lateral
costophrenic angle is suggestive of an effusion.  Cardiac
silhouette is difficult to assess given differences in
positioning and technique, but likely has not changed.
IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in the appearance of the lungs
with some persistent left basilar opacity, potentially
atelectasis versus aspiration/infection and small probable right
pleural effusion.

CXR [**6-13**]:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an
increase in extent of a pre-existing small pleural effusion and
a newly occurred small right pleural effusion.  Subsequently,
areas of atelectasis are seen at the lung bases.  In addition,
the pre-existing left basal opacity with air bronchograms
persists.  The presence of aspiration pneumonia cannot be
excluded.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no
pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 62417**] is an 81F w/hx osteoporosis, recurrent [**Known lastname **] UTIs, HTN,
parkinsonian features and depression with recent admission for
pna/uti requiring ICU admission now p/w new oxygen requirement,
subjective fever, and cough found to have pneumonia. She was
initially stabilized in the ICU given NRB requirement, but this
was weaned and the patient's care was continued on the floor. On
the floor, the patient had intermittent desaturations due to
mucus plugging that required intermittent suctioning.

1. Pneumonia:
The patient presented with fevers, leukocytosis, productive
cough and CXR with bilateral opacities. Patient coming from
nursing home with recent hospitalization, so initially treated
as healthcare associated PNA with Vancomycin and Cefepime,
however, patient's respiratory status improved rapidly and she
remained HD stable and afebrile. On HD# 2, abx narrowed to PO
levofloxacin (day 1 [**6-9**]). Her last day of levofloxacin will be
on [**6-17**]. The patient continued to have intermittent
desaturations on the floor due to mucus plugging and her
inability to clear secretions. She has a weak cough, due to
deconditioning and malnutrition. She will need MACU level care
for pulmonary toilet and suctioning. The patient is at a
continuous increased risk of aspiration and plugging due to her
overall health.

2. Chronic Pain: Pt w/known pelvic fracture 5y ago and
osteoporosis. We continued her oxycodone, Tylenol, and
Gabapentin.

3. Chronic Constipation: Continued Miralax and senna.

4. Severe Malnutrition: Due to eating disorder, psych NOS.
Encourage eating and supplement TID.

5. Code Status: Wheelchair bound at baseline. DNR/DNI


Medications on Admission:
1. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet 0.5 Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) prn
pain 2. gabapentin 100 mg Cap
