Admission Date:  [**2126-1-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2126-2-6**]


Service:  NEUROSURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year old
woman who was found to be dizzy all of a sudden when changing
from a lying to sitting position.  She apparently did not
have a headache, nor did she have one on arrival in the
Emergency Department.  She was brought to [**Hospital3 3583**]
with slurred speech.  Head CT showed a 2.0 to 3.0 centimeter
cerebellar hemorrhage and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Anxiety disorder.
3.  Leg stasis ulcers.
4.  Osteoarthritis.
5.  Irritable bowel syndrome.
6.  Status post cataract surgery.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Ativan.
2.  Meclizine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Her son is her health care proxy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, her temperature is
97.5, heart rate 75, blood pressure 206/96, respiratory rate
20, oxygen saturation 93% in room air.  She was an elderly
woman in no acute distress on admission.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination - The pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are full.  Lungs showed coarse bilateral breath
sounds.  Cardiovascular - irregularly irregular, grade III/VI
systolic murmur at the base.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender.  Extremities - venous stasis, left greater than
right.  Neurologically, she is awake, alert, oriented to
[**Hospital 86**] Hospital, [**Hospital6 1129**].   Cranial
nerves - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation, 4.0 down to 3.0 millimeters bilaterally.
Extraocular movements are full.  No nystagmus.  The face was
symmetric.  Tongue was midline.  Speech was markedly
dysarthric.  Motor strength - She had a positive grasp reflex
in the right upper extremity, both arms drifted downward,
4+/5 finger flexion, triceps, biceps and deltoids, cannot
sustain IPs to gravity and persistent with TIATs. Deep tendon
reflexes 3+ everywhere with couple beats of clonus in
bilateral lower extremities.  Toes on the right were upgoing,
left were mute.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
9.6, hematocrit 40.2, platelet count 196,000.  Sodium 142,
potassium 4.1, chloride 102, bicarbonate 29, blood urea
nitrogen 18, creatinine 0.9, glucose 124.

Head CT again showed 2.0 by 3.3 centimeter right cerebellar
parenchymal hemorrhage with no intraventricular extension.
Chest x-ray showed pulmonary vascular congestion.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with borderline
right bundle branch block with no ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Neurologic
Intensive Care Unit for close neurologic observation.  On
[**2126-1-23**], the patient had a repeat head CT which was
unchanged from previous scan.  Her neurologic status remained
stable.  She continued to be awake and alert.  Speech was
garbled, following commands, left greater than right.  The
left pupil was 0.5 millimeter larger than the right.
Attempts to show two fingers on the left and wiggle her toes
bilaterally.  Follows simple commands.  Her blood pressure
was being controlled to keep it less than 140 using Nipride
as needed.  The patient had several episodes of severe
agitation requiring Haldol and Ativan during the night which
caused her to be neurologically lethargic.  She was not
following commands, withdrawal and localized in all
extremities and toes were downgoing bilaterally.  She was
then switched from Ativan to just Haldol to control her
agitation and severe anxiety.  On [**2126-1-27**], she was sleepy
but arousable to voice.  She sticks out her tongue, squeezes
hands bilaterally, wiggles her toes bilaterally.  The pupil
was still slightly larger on the left than the right with a
left exotropia and toes were still downgoing.  Head CT on
[**2126-1-28**], was unchanged.  On [**2126-1-28**], she was much brighter,
wiggling her toes, following commands.  The patient had a
swallow evaluation done on [**2126-1-29**], which showed that she
failed her swallow evaluation and would require a feeding
tube.  That was placed.  The patient was transferred to the
regular floor on [**2126-1-29**].  That evening she had an episode
of acute respiratory distress and was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit.  However, not intubated, she was given
Lasix with good effect.  On [**2126-1-30**], she was awake and
oriented to hospital, wiggling her toes and showing her
thumbs bilaterally.  Her face was symmetric.  An
echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction
greater than 55% with moderate tricuspid regurgitation and
mitral regurgitation and severe pulmonary artery
hypertension.  On [**2126-2-1**], the patient was continued to be
in the Intensive Care Unit and was seen by cardiology service
for episodes of sinus pauses up to 2.8 seconds.  She was
asymptomatic from this but also having what looked like
possible ventricular tachycardia, fourteen beats.  With
closer observation, cardiology felt that this might be atrial
fibrillation with aberrancy.  Cardiology felt that her pauses
were likely due to beta blockers and so they were
discontinued and the patient was put on alternative non
negative chronotropic medication such as an ace inhibitor. No
other treatment was necessary at that time.  On [**2126-2-2**], she
was transferred to the regular floor.  She was awake and
following commands times four, speech was dysarthric.  The
patient was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy
and found to require acute rehabilitation.  She was also
evaluated by the [**Hospital **] Clinic for increased glucose levels
up into the high 100s.  They recommended starting the patient
on Glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. once daily and watching her insulin
sliding scale.  She also had two episodes of guaiac positive
stool.  She does have a history of irritable bowel syndrome
and has not had a screening colonoscopy in the last six or
seven years.  That is recommended as an outpatient.  The
patient's hematocrit has remained stable despite this guaiac
positive stool with no episodes of tachycardia or frank
blood.  Her condition remains stable.  She is neurologically
stable and ready for transfer to rehabilitation. However the
planned date of transfer she had a severe episode of melena and
was transfered to  medicine service in MICU forfurther care.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Glipizide 2.5 mg p.o. q.a.m.
2.  Neutra-Phos one packet p.o. twice a day for three days.
3.  Insulin sliding scale.
4.  Calcium Carbonate 10cc p.o. twice a day for two days
which was started on [**2126-2-4**]/
5.  Metronidazole 500 mg nasogastric q8hours for five days,
started on [**2126-2-2**].
6.  Famotidine 20 mg intravenously q12hours.
7.  Enalapril 5 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Levofloxacin 250 mg intravenously q24hours for seven days
for aspiration pneumonia. Started on [**2126-2-2**].
9.  Albuterol nebulizers.
10. Haldol p.r.n. for agitation.
11. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous q12hours.
12. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4hours p.r.n.
