CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 39-year-old female with human
immunodeficiency virus, last CD4 count of 400 two months ago
in [**2142-5-12**] presents with four days of fever to 104??????,
chills, nausea and diarrhea, also with multiple other
complaints, intermittent abdominal pain, myalgias,
arthralgias and headache, but these are classified as chronic
according to the patient.  The patient also says that her
diarrhea is chronic.  The patient presented on [**2142-7-24**] to [**Hospital6 1708**] where an abdominal CT
was obtained which was negative and blood cultures were drawn
in the Emergency Department.  The patient was then
discharged.  Today, a report from [**Hospital6 15291**] is 1 of 4 blood cultures positive for gram positive
cocci.

In the Emergency Department here, two additional sets of
blood cultures were sent and the patient was started on
vancomycin and gentamicin.  The patient also has end stage
renal disease on hemodialysis Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays.  The patient had a fistulogram of the left upper
extremity AV graft with angioplasty six days ago.  The
patient missed last hemodialysis prior to admission because
she felt too sick to leave home.  Patient's nephrologist is
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

EXTREMITIES:  2+ peripheral pulses, no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  Left upper extremity fistula with a bruit and thrill.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  Strength ..........

INITIAL LABS:  Sodium 134, potassium 5.1 moderately
hemolyzed, chloride 96, bicarbonate 14, BUN 81, creatinine
17.2, glucose 181, calcium 9.7.  White count 3.4, 81%
neutrophils, 14% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes, hematocrit 31.0,
platelets 133.  PT of 13.9, INR of 1.3.

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray done in Emergency Department showed a
small left effusion, no consolidation, mild vascular
engorgement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Seen after admission to [**Hospital3 **], the
patient complained of her typical migraine headache,
photophobia headache, nausea, developed [**9-20**] substernal
chest pain and complained of throbbing pain on the left upper
extremity AV graft.  The patient also developed shaking
chills and desaturation on room air to 87%.  The patient was
taken to emergent hemodialysis where a Quinton catheter was
placed.  Arterial blood gas was performed showing a mixed
respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis.  The patient
was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
observation or further treatment.

The patient's blood cultures in the Emergency Department came
back [**3-15**] positive for coagulase positive Staphylococcus
aureus and the patient was continued on vancomycin and
gentamicin in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient
was evaluated by surgery and had AV graft removal in the
Operating Room where a hematoma was seen and graft was sent
for culture.  The patient also had a PPE performed which
showed severe mitral regurgitation, good left ventricular
ejection fraction and a small density on the mitral valve
that was suspicious for a vegetative lesion.  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit and was restarted on her HAART while continuing
vancomycin and gentamicin until [**2142-7-27**] at which
point she was transferred to the floor for further medical
treatment.  What follows is her hospital course from [**7-27**] onward.

Cardiovascular:  The patient's antihypertensive medications
were stopped initially, as the patient was hypotensive during
acute sepsis with blood pressures down to 120s/70s.  After
receiving vancomycin and gentamicin, the patient's blood
pressures had been returning to normal hypertensive values.
The patient was initially restarted on enalapril 5 mg po bid
titrated up to 10 mg po bid.  As blood pressures kept coming
up, the patient was restarted on labetalol 400 mg po bid.
The patient will be discharged on usual cardiac medications
at home.  The patient was taken off telemetry after coming
back from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She had been
complaining of chest pain during her acute septic episode,
but has not been complaining of chest pain ever since
transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Serial ECGs
had revealed no ST changes in the Medical Intensive Care Unit
and pericardiac catheter showed clean coronary arteries,
making ischemic cause of her chest pain highly unlikely.  The
patient received TEE on the [**7-27**] which showed
severe mitral regurgitation from a prolapsed leaflet.  No
vegetation seen.  No pericardial effusion seen.  Trace aortic
insufficiency.  Ejection fraction normal.  The patient had a
[**3-17**] holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla which did not
change throughout hospital course.

2.  Pulmonary:  Soon after transfer to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, the patient developed new wheezing and dry
crackles.  The patient's O2 saturations were consistently
above 90 initially on 2 liters per nasal cannula, but
eventually weaned off of oxygen entirely with good O2
saturations.  The patient's lung exam revealed crackles with
prolonged expiratory phase, however no wheezing.  The patient
had a peak flow at bed side which showed peak flows between
300 and 400 which vary depending on patient effort.  The
patient had serial chest x-rays.  On [**7-24**], chest x-ray
showed no evidence of pneumonia, linear atelectasis of the
left base.  Chest x-ray on the 14th showed no acute
cardiopulmonary disease.  Chest x-ray on the 16th showed no
evidence of congestive heart failure or pneumonia, unchanged
from prior study.  Chest x-ray on the 17th showed no acute
cardiopulmonary disease, continued prominent vasculature
consistent with mild congestive heart failure, but TCP could
not be ruled.  The patient's dry crackles, prolonged
expiratory phase, gradually improved throughout hospital
course.  The patient was started on Robitussin DM for cough,
has sputum collected for gram stain and culture and had
gentle chest PT instituted with good response.

3.  Renal:  The patient has end stage renal dis
