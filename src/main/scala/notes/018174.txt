History of Present Illness:
59 y/o female with PMH significant for severe ischemic
cardiomyopathy with a LVEF of 15%, CAD, and pulmonary
hypertension admitted through the ED with lethargy and severe
laboratory abnormalities. Pt is really unable to give any
history. She simply reports that her girlfriend made her come
in. She reports that she has been feeling fine and denies any
pain. [**Location (un) **] available notes, the pt's neightbor had called Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 2031**] and reported that the pt had been more lethargic over the
last day or so. The neighbor called EMS to bring the pt to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.

*** Not Signed Out ***
BRIEF HISTORY:   The patient is a 59 year old woman with an
ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) and severe mitral regurgitation s/p
BiV-ICD
placement with PAF, severe pulmonary hypertension, and
hypothyroidism
who is referred to the catheterization lab for evaluation of
hemodynamic
measurements with infusion of dopamine and dobutamine.
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Class IV heart failure, pre-cardiac transplant evaluation.
PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through a 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
A 5 French arterial sheath was placed for measurement of
arterial
pressure and for arterial blood draws.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
      Resting hemodynamics upon entry revealed moderately
elevated right
and severely elevated left sided filling pressures, with a mean
RA of
11, RVEDP of 19, mean PCWP of 32 mm Hg. Severe pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension was present, at 73/32 (mean 47 mm Hg). Central
systemic
arterial pressures were normal (124/70 mean 82 mm Hg). The
cardiac index
as calculated from the Fick equation was depressed, at 2.2
L/min/m2. The
SVR was elevated at 1385 dynes/sec/cm5.
      With infusion of dopamine (5 mcg/kg/min), there was no
significant
change in the pulmonary artery pressure (80/40/55 mm Hg). The
cardiac
index was minimally higher (2.4 L/min/m2). The systemic arterial

pressure was likewise unchanged (131/74/93 mm Hg).
     After stopping dopamine infusion, initiating dobutamine,
and
titrating the dosage upwards to 10 mcg/kg/min, the patient's
pulmonary
arterial pressures decreased slightly to 65/24 with a mean of 38
mm Hg.
Her mean PCWP decreased significantly to 18 mm Hg (from baseline
of 32
mm Hg), and her systemic arterial pressure remained essentially
unchanged (120/52/73 mm Hg). Her cardiac index also
significantly
improved, from a baseline of 2.2 to 4.0 L/min/m2 with dobutamine

infusion. Her SVR also significantly decreased from baseline of
1385 to
587 dynes/s/cm2 with dobutamine infusion. Th
