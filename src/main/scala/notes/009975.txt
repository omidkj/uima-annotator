PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination
showed a temperature of 96.8; heart rate of 72; blood
pressure 145/66; respiratory rate of 18; saturation rate of
92% on room air.  The patient is an elderly male, in mild
distress.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen was soft.  Tender in the upper quadrant,
right greater than left.  Mildly distended.  Normoactive
bowel sounds.  Normal tone.  Guaiac negative.  Rectal:  No

LABORATORY DATA:  White count on admission was 12.9;
hematocrit of 35; platelets of 407 with 86% neutrophils and 0
bands.  Chemistries were 137; 5.4; 96; 33; BUN 48; creatinine
1.5; glucose of 167; AST of 13; ALT of 21; alkaline
phosphatase of 57; T bilirubin of .3; amylase 40; lipase of
20; lactate of 1.7.  PT was 13.1; PTT was 26.5 and INR was
1.1.

Urinalysis was negative.

CTA showed no abdominal aortic aneurysm, no free air around
the gastric antrum. Subhepatic fluid. Gallbladder was normal
without fluid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 89 year old man with
coronary artery disease, hypertension, spinal stenosis.  He
was doing well until the onset of upper abdominal pain at
noon on the date of admission, without previous episodes.
Positive coronary artery disease with catheterization in
[**11-20**] revealing occluded left anterior descending.  He
appeared tired and uncomfortable.  Abdomen was distended,
tympanitic with upper abdominal tenderness and guarding.

White blood count, as I said before was 12.9.  CT scan was as
mentioned before; thickened antrum, free air along the
gastrohepatic ligament and extravasation of contrast.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Gastric perforation.  The patient was
to proceed urgently to the operating room for exploration or
biopsy with ongoing resuscitation.  Ongoing antibiotics were
administered.  There was perioperative beta blockade and
postoperative Intensive Care Unit care was planned.

Postoperatively, the patient's vital signs were stable but
the patient was in atrial fibrillation without apparent
atrial fibrillation complications.  The patient received
Amiodarone load times two and intravenous Metoprolol q. six
hours and was transferred to the unit.

On postoperative day number one, Surgical Intensive Care Unit
day one, the patient had decreased Propofol and was allowed
to waken.  He was weaned to PSE and was planned to extubate.
He was continued on Levofloxacin and Fluconazole.  On
postoperative day number two, the patient's cardiac output
was adequate.  He had a fixed heart rate and was on low
dose Neo.  He was actually extubated that day.
Incidentally J tube and G tube for feeding were placed
intraoperatively.

Cardiology continued to follow the patient throughout his
hospital course and followed along with enzymes.  Beta
blockade was continued throughout postoperative day number
three and four.  The patient was given 10 mg of Lasix on
postoperative day number three, to be net even.  J tube feeds
with Peptamen was started on postoperative day number three.
The patient was continued on Levo and Flagyl.  The patient
was transferred to the floor on [**2154-2-15**] on postoperative day
number three and tube feeds were increased to 20, changed to
Impact.

The patient didn't actually make it to the floor until
postoperative day number four.  The patient began running low
grade fevers on postoperative day number five and six.
However, he still looked good and passed a bedside swallowing
evaluation on postoperative day number six.  He was started
on slowly advanced diets.

His belly started becoming distended on postoperative day
number seven. CT scan with contrast was done on that day,
showing fluid with air anterior to the gastric fundus and
adjacent to the body of the stomach and thickening at the
gastric remnant.  This fluid with rim enhancement adjacent to
the caudate lobe; small liver laceration, without evidence of
obstruction at that time.  The patient's white count of
postoperative day number 7 was 17.1 and continued to rise to
21.6 by postoperative day number 11 and 26.1 by postoperative
day number 12.

The patient was advanced to full liquid diet on postoperative
day number eight and was given Lasix 20 mg intravenous times
one for increased weight. The patient began having some
confusion without fevers and stable vital signs; however, he
had increased work of breathing on [**2-20**], postoperative day
number eight.  An arterial blood gases was sent at that time
showing blood gas of 7.45; 49; 151; 135 and 9.

Physical therapy continued with the patient throughout the
hospital course as per cardiology.  They recommended
Amiodarone 400 mg q. day until discharge.  On [**2154-2-23**], the
patient was noted to have left arm weakness, on postoperative
day number 11.  Neurology was consulted to evaluate this
weakness and neurology noted that after the patient's
emergent exploratory laparotomy for perforated duodenal
ulcer, the patient's postoperative course had been relatively
stable, although he had been in paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and had been in sinus rhythm over the past three
days prior to neurology's visit.

Around 10 or 11 o'clock, the morning of [**2-23**], the patient was
noted to be significantly weaker in his left upper extremity,
as he could not lift it.  His arm was found to be flaccid by
our surgical house staff.  He did not notice any dysarthria,
facial numbness, weakness or hemi-anesthesia.  He had waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status over the past 72 hours prior to his
neurology visit on [**2-23**] but was attributed to pain medication.
However, he became less alert and confused in the evening and
it was thought to be sun downing.  He was never weak in his
extremities at this time, however.

ASSESSMENT:  At that time, assessment showed a [**Age over 90 **] year old
man with various risk factors, including age, hypertension,
coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, now
presenting with four to five hour history of sudden onset of
left sided weakness, arm greater than leg.  Neurologic
examination confirmed a left facial droop, almost flaccid
left arm and upper motor neuron weakness in the left lower
extremity.  There was also decreased sensation of temperature
and light touch on the left arm and face.  The presentation
was suspicious for stroke but many possible etiologies
involving the face, arm and leg may indicate either occlusion
of the right internal carotid artery, although there would be
expected more signs, including field cut, neglect, etc.;
however, the most likely scenario is embolic etiology for pad
or carotid effecting vasculature territories or M1 occlusion
effecting subcortical descending like fibers.  Due to
surgery, he was not a candidate for TPA but neurology noted
that he would likely benefit from anticoagulation. The
patient had a Stat magnetic resonance scan done and on
[**2154-2-24**], after normal h
