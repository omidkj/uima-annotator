Date of Birth:  [**2101-9-16**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NB


HISTORY:  [**Known lastname 42642**] [**Known lastname 58117**] was born at 30-2/7-weeks gestation by
cesarean section for premature rupture of membranes, footling-
breech presentation.  The mother is a 36-year-old gravida 1,
para 0 now 1 woman.  The mother's prenatal screens are blood
type A positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR
nonreactive, hepatitis surface antigen negative, CF negative,
GC negative, chlamydia negative, and group B Strep unknown.
The mother's previous history is notable for benign thyroid
nodule treated with a partial thyroidectomy and fibroids.

This pregnancy was complicated by vaginal bleeding in the
first trimester attributed to a partial abruption and a
shorten cervix and preterm labor at 22 weeks treated with
indomethacin.  Premature rupture of membranes occurred two
weeks prior to delivery.  The mother received antibiotics at
this time.  The patient received a full course of steroids at
25 weeks gestation.  The infant emerged with fair tone, but
inconsistent respiratory effort.  Apgars were 6 at 1 minute
and 8 at 5 minutes.  The birth weight was 1,755 grams.  The
birth length is 43 cm and the birth head circumference 29.25
cm, all within the 75th to 90th percentile for gestational
age.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:  Nondysmorphic preterm infant.
Anterior fontanel is soft and flat.  Palate intact.  Mild
nasal flaring.  Positive bilateral red reflex.  Moderate
retractions.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
Abdomen is soft, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly, three-
vessel umbilical cord and age appropriate tone and reflexes.

NICU COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
Respiratory:  [**Known lastname 42642**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 58118**] soon after admission.  She
received three doses of Surfactant.  She did require high
frequency ventilation until day of life number seven when she
weaned to nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure.  On
day of life number eight, she went on  to nasal cannula oxygen
and then weaned to room air successfully on day of life number
32, where she has remained.  She has had only occasional episodes
of apnea and bradycardia, the last one occurring on [**2101-10-31**].  On
exam, her respirations are comfortable.  Lung sounds are clear
and equal.

Cardiovascular:  An echocardiogram done on the day of
delivery for a murmur revealed a moderate-to-large patent
ductus arteriosus and [**Known lastname 42642**] was treated with a course of
indomethacin.  A follow-up echocardiogram revealed no patent
ductus and a structurally normal heart.  She has remained
normotensive throughout her NICU stay.  She has had an
intermittent grade 1-2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left
upper sternal border consistent with peripheral pulmonic
stenosis.

Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  At the time of
discharge, her weight is 3,350 grams.  Length 48.5 cm.  Head
circumference 35.5 cm.  Enteral feeds were begun on day of
life number 4 and advanced to full volume by day of life 11.
She was increased to 24 calories/ounce formula and that is
the formula that she is being discharged home on, on an adlib
schedule.

Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname 42642**] was treated with phototherapy for
hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity from day of life number two
until day of life number nine.  Her peak bilirubin occurred on
day of life seven and was total 10.0 and direct 0.3.

Hematology:  [**Known lastname 42642**] has received no blood product
transfusions during her NICU stay.  Her last hematocrit on
[**2101-10-15**] was 28.9 with a reticulocyte count of 7.8 percent.
She has been receiving supplemental iron at 2 mg/kg/day.

Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname 42642**] was started on ampicillin
and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk
factors.  She completed a seven day course of antibiotics for
presumed sepsis.  Her blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
remained negative.  She has remained off antibiotics since
that time.

Skin:  [**Known lastname 42642**] has a 1 x 1 cm flat hemangioma at her
midsternal area.

Neurological:  Head ultrasound on [**2101-9-23**] and [**2101-10-21**] were
within normal limits.

Sensory:  Audiology:  Hearing screening was performed with
automated auditory brain stem responses and the infant passed
in both ears.

Ophthalmology:  Eyes were examined most recently on [**2101-11-16**]
revealing immaturity of the retinal vessels, but no
retinopathy.  A follow-up exam should be scheduled for the
week of [**2101-12-7**].
