Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
A-Fib with RVR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal ECHO and cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
84 y/o woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
who is here for afib with RVR.  The patient has recently had
multiple hospitalizations, one for the same complaint and
another for a complaint of chronic dyspnea and lightheadedness.
She has had multiple cardioversions, the most recent on [**2138-6-18**]
during which she was also loaded on amiodarone and started on
pradaxa.  Both of these medications had since been stopped due
to side effects and ecchymoses.
.
Her most recent hospitalization was seven days ago when she
underwent an extensive workup for her dyspnea, however
investigations including spirometry, persantine MIBI and
echocardiogram were all unrevealing for a cause of her symptoms.
.
This morning the patient reports waking up feeling dyspnea and
chest pressure; she checked her heart rate and found it to be in
the 140s, and on the advice of her telehealth team came in to be
evaluated.  Her [**Doctor Last Name **] of hearts monitor at the time showed sinus
rhythm followed by APCs with a 5 beat run of NSVT, then atrial
fibrillation.
.
In the ED, she was started on a nitroglycerin and heparin drip.
Her blood pressure proved to be labile and dropped from the 110s
systolic to the 80s.  Cardiology was consulted who recommended
metoprolol 2.5mg IV which had some mild effect on her rate.  Her
chest pressure resolved and the nitroglycerin drip was stopped.

.
On review of systems, she reports intermittent dizziness and
dyspnea on exertion at home.  She has no history of stroke or
TIA.  No history of recent weight change or edema.  No
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

DISCHARGE LABS

PERTINENT STUDIES

EKG [**2138-8-20**] Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse low voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2138-8-19**]
the ventricular response has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic
interim change.

CXR ([**2138-8-16**]):  No acute cardiopulmonary process
CXR ([**2138-8-20**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
no relevant
change. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with mild
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pleural effusion. No
pulmonary edema. No hilar or
mediastinal abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 y/o woman with history of diastolic CHF and paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation who presents with chest discomfort, dyspnea and
atrial fibrillation with RVR.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
# AFIB WITH RVR: Patient was recently taken off her amiodarone
secondary to side effects and has an enlarged left atrium. She
likely has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  After discussion
about side effects and benefits of treatment, patient opted to
restart amiodarone. She was loaded with 200mg TID. She was rate
controlled with metoprolol 25mg po BID and anticoagulated with
heparin bridge and warfarin 3mg po daily. Metoprolol was
discontinued prior to cardioversion.  Patient was cardioverted
on HD8.  It was felt that her amiodarone level at this time was
adequate to increase the likelihood the patient would remain in
sinus rhythm after cardioversion.  At the time of discharge,
patient's INR was 2.6.  Patient will have an INR machine
delivered to her home and will be instructed on how to use it.
She is aware that her goal INR is 2.0-3.0.

# DYSPNEA: Unclear etiology; patient is s/p extensive workup
without clear etiology.   She does report feeling her symptoms
more acutely as she falls asleep and when she wakes up, so it is
possibly related to her sleep-disordered breathing. Not hypoxic
during SOB episodes. Reviewed OMR notes and found an issue with
LH and dizziness with Ipratroprium and Spiriva in the past, but
these symptoms seemed to persist after stopping the medicine.
[**Month/Day/Year 1570**]'s reviewed with team. During admission the patient did have
intermittent shortness of breath with some wheezing.  Chest xray
was unconcerning for pneumonia, white blood cell count was
within normal range and the patient was afebrile throughout
admission. Dyspnea likely related to both her atrial
fibrillation and COPD.  For her COPD she was given Atrovent
nebulizer treatments and started on Spiriva.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# dCHF: No evidence of acute CHF exacerbation. She was continued
on her home lasix.

# ANXIETY: Home alprazolam was continued. SW also asked to
evaluate and recommended outpatient counseling.

TRANSITIONAL ISSES:
-Patient maintained full code status throughout hospitalization
-Continue amiodarone 200mg po BID, with monitoring of PFTs,
TFTs, and LFTs
-Continue coumadin with INR monitoring (goal 2.0-3.0)
-Follow up with outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
