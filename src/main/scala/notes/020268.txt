Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 year old male with past medical history of
diverticulosis and melanoma who presented with with altered
mental status after a fall. The exact details of what happened
are a bit unclear as patient is not able to give a full history
but on [**2117-1-9**] the patient was shoveling snow when he sustained
a fall and struck his head. He managed to get inside and call
his daughter who came to check on him and found him very
confused but able to speak with blood visible outside and inside
the house. She brought the patient to the ED where he had head
CT revealing intraparenchymal and subdural hemorrhages and
neurosurgery was consulted. They recommended no acute
neurosurgical management at the time. Patient was extremely
confused and becoming less responsive at that time so he was
emergently intubated for airway protection and admitted to the
neurosurgery ICU. Of night, he had a CT of his chest, abdomen,
and pelvis that night, which was remarkable for signs of
aspiration as well as some free air in his abdomen. His
abdominal exam was benign and surgery evaluated him feeling
there were no signs of an acute surgical abdomen or need for
intervention.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT [**2117-1-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multi-compartment intracranial hemorrhage, including
extensive left
parafalcine and left convexity mixed density subdural hematoma,
left inferior frontal hemorrhagic contusion, and scattered
bifrontal subarachnoid blood.  There is mass effect upon the
left cerebral hemisphere, with 1-cm rightward
shift of midline structures, and some evidence of encroachment
upon the left suprasellar cistern.
2. Left frontal subgaleal hematoma, with underlying nondisplaced
skull
fracture.

CT Cspine [**2117-1-9**]:
IMPRESSION: No apparent fracture or traumatic malalignment
involving the
cervical spine. Degenerative changes are noted, worse from C5
through T1.
Note that motion artifact somewhat limits evaluation of the
lower cervical
spine, and if there is high clinical suspicion for injury,
repeat CT or MR
could be considered for further evaluation.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**2117-1-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral dependent pulmonary opacities, most compatible with
aspiration.
2. Low positioning of the endotracheal tube, which is positioned
2 cm above the carina, and could be withdrawn for optimal
positioning.
3. Free intraperitoneal air, located anterior to the liver, in
the splenic
hilum, and tracking through the hiatal hernia defect into the
hiatal hernia sac. While highly worrisome for bowel perforation,
the source is unclear. If further evaluation is desired, CT with
enteric contrast could be considered.
4. Indeterminate 2.1 cm right adrenal mass. If clinically
indicated, when
patient is stable, dedicated adrenal MRI or CT could be
performed.
5. Small amount of free fluid tracking into the right inguinal
hernia.
6. Extensive aortic atherosclerosis.
7. Degenerative changes throughout the spine, with no evidence
of fracture.

Head CT [**2117-1-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimally changed multi-compartment intracranial hemorrhage,
as detailed above. Blood is now seen layering in the right
lateral ventricle. Mass effect upon the left cerebral hemisphere
is stable, with persistent sulcal effacement, 1 cm rightward
shift of midline structures, and minimal
encroachment upon the left suprasellar cistern without [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2713**] herniation. This is unchanged from prior study.
2. Nondisplaced skull fracture, as previously demonstrated.

Head CT [**2117-1-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Compared to the study from 1820H and, in particular, the
study from 1355H (both [**1-9**]), there has been mild interval
increase in the subdural hematoma layering along the left
cerebral convexity and that leaflet of the tentorium cerebelli,
as well as the intraventricular and left more than right
subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Evolving large left frontal hemorrhagic contusion.
3. Unchanged mass effect with stable 10mm rightward shift of
midline
structures.
4. No evidence of [**Month (only) 2713**] herniation or acute infarction.


Head CT [**2117-1-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease in density of left subdural hemorrhage.
Interval mild
prominence of the right extra-axial space concerning for
post-traumatic
hygroma.
2. Subdural hematoma layering along the tentorium cerebelli,
similar to
prior. Similar intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of bilateral lateral ventricles.
3. Similar bilateral foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
4. Evolving large left frontal hemorrhagic contusion.
5. Evolving areas of hypodensities in bilateral frontal lobes;
evolving
contusions.
6. Similar mass effect with a similar approximately 7 mm
rightward shift of midline structures.
7. No evidence of hydrocephalus.

CXR [**2117-1-13**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-9**], there is
diffusely increased prominence of pulmonary vessels consistent
with vascular congestion. In the appropriate clinical setting,
the possibility of superimposed pneumonia, especially on the
left, must be considered. Large hiatal hernia is again seen.

CXR [**2117-1-14**]:
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Analysis is performed in direct
comparison
with the next preceding similar study of [**2117-1-13**]. Again
there is
perivascular haze indicative of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Basal
densities exist more marked on the left than on the right. Again
as mentioned on preceding study, consideration for superimposed
pneumonic infiltrates in this patient with CHF must be
considered. There is no significant interval change during the
latest 24 hours examination interval.

ECHO [**2117-1-15**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a severe resting
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitra
