History of Present Illness:
77 yo F discharged from the hospital [**1-9**] (yesterday) after
prolonged stay.  Pt had initially presented on [**12-8**] for R iliac
bleeding after removal of R hip infected hardware on [**12-8**],
admitted to vascular service.  Her iliac vein was packed to stop
bleeding.  Her course was complicated by hypotension requiring
pressors, rapid AF started on amiodarone, Gram neg bacteremia
(serratia and enterobacter) as well as MSSA wound infection.  In
addition, she had VT requiring electrical cardioversion,
intubation.  She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics,
(2wks of vanco initially, then restarted on [**1-2**] for another
planned 2 wks in setting of fever, increased WBC) as well as
(2wks of meropenem, then followed by another 1 week of meropenem
from [**1-2**] to [**1-9**], which was discontinued just prior to
discharge given no evidence of further gram negative infection).
Her stay was notable for attempts at diuresis, complicated by
hypotension.  She was difficult to weane off mechanical
ventilation as contributed to by a pneumonia (tx with 2 wk
course of vanco), pulmonary edema c large b/l pleural effusions,
myopathy.  She had trach/PEG placed during the admission.
Pt was noted to be agitated last night at rehab, received ativan
and this morning was noted to be unresposive, hypoxemic with O2
sats in 70's, hypotensive to 70's/palp.  Pt received 2 L NS en
route and in ED, initial vitals 98.8, HR 95, BP 86/62, 100% on
AC ventilation.  She was started on levophed, received
vancomycin and ceftazidime.  In addition, she was noted to have
? ST depressions in V4-V6, given ASA 300 PR.  Cardiac enzymes
with nl CK, troponin 0.14.  Notably she had cardiac enzymes leak
to 0.18 during her recent admission.
On arrival to MICU, pt arousable to painful stimuli, but unable
to provide further history.

Physical Exam:
Vitals:  Temp 98.0, HR 91 (AFib), BP 101/57, RR 16, O2 sat 100%
Vent: 400/16/0.6/5
Gen: elderly female, ventilated through trach, responsive to
painful stimuli such as suctioning, tracks
HEENT: head symmetric and atraumatic, PERRL, anicteric sclera,
OP clear
Neck: RIJ in place, no surrounding erythema or discharge

Abd: soft, + BS, NTND, no HSM, no rebound or guarding
Ext: cool, no pitting edema, palpable pedal pulses.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: Afib at 93, nl axis, no Q waves, ? ST depressions and T
wave inversions V4-V6, although poor baseline.  Changes resolved
with resolution of hypotension
.
CXR [**1-10**]:
1.  Large bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe
consolidations which could represent atelectasis, however a
superimposed infection cannot be completely excluded.
2.  Redemonstration of large amount of pneumoperitoneum.
.
CTA [**1-10**]:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Stable large bilateral pleural effusion with worsening
bilateral patchy consolidations and areas of ground-glass
opacity in the aerated portions of both lungs.  While this may
represent worsening pulmonary edema, superimposed infection is
not excluded.
.
CT head [**1-10**]: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  Note
that MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for
the detection of infarction.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77 year old female with hx CHF, Afib, anemia, s/p hip
fracture, seeding of hardware from septic shoulder s/p removal,
recently discharged presents with MS changes, hypoxia and
hypotension.
.
# Hypotension: pt initially hypotensive to 70's, improved with
about 7 L of IVF NS.  In addition, she required levophed, and
vasopressin.  The patient did not tolerate turning vasopressing
off, so dobutamine was started after SvO2 was noted to be 68.
The patient responded well to dobutamine, BP stabilized and she
started autodiuresing.  The dobutamine was discontinued on [**1-14**]
and she has been autodiuresing well.  Her initial infectious
work-up revealed a positive urinalysis, however urine culture
was negative.  Her WBC count was initially elevated to 24.7 with
L shift (up from about 14 prior to discharge), however was 13
the following day.  In addition her chest CT was suggestive of a
new infiltrate in addition to her pleural effusion.  She was
continued on vancomycin, restarted on meropenem and ceftazidime
was added given recent prolonged exposure to meropenem.
Ceftazidime was discontinued after several days after no
evidence of gram negative infection.  Meropenem and vacomycin
were discontinued after 7 day course, cultures remained
negative, she remained afebrile and stable WBC count.
.
#Cardiac
*Atrial fibrillation - appears to be fairly well controlled,
unlikely to be major cause of hypotension.  Continued amiodarone
and digoxin.  Initially on coumadin 6mg but her INR was
supratherapeutic up to 6.2 and coumadin was held.  Once back in
the normal range restarted at a dose of 2mg daily.
.
*CAD - Her elevated cardiac enzymes and lateral EKG changes
raise possibility of a cardiac cause, however pt had similar
findings during last stay, believed to be [**3-13**] demand.  Cardiac
enzymes stable.  Continued ASA, statin.  BB, ACEI were held off
given hypotension.  Should be restarted as tolerated.
.
* CHF, MR - Pt has a hx of severe MR.  Did well with dobutamine
as above. Her after load reduction with ACEI was held off
initially given hypotension and should be restarted as
tolerated.  She is volume overloaded at time of discharge and
will need continued diuresis.
.
# Respiratory Failure, hypoxemic: pt has been weaning off trach,
recently on pressure support.  Initially placed on AC
ventilation, and once s
