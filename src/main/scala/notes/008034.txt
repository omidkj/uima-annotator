tissue)


History of Present Illness:
This 85 year old male underwent coronary bypass grafting in [**2177**]
at [**Hospital1 3278**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 50180**].  He now has progressive aortic stenosis
and mitral regurgitation. He was seen last in [**2188-8-17**]. At
that time surgery was deferred as he was deemed extremely high
risk.

He was seen in clinic [**5-/2189**] asking about not only surgical but
also percutaneous options. He has had dyspnea on exertion and
now
has had several episodes of dyspnea that awoke him from sleep.
He
has found it hard to go back to sleep.  He was admitted to MWMC
a week prior to this visit for increased shortness of breath and
found to be in failure. He was discharged home on increased
Lasix.  His dyspnea occurs at night and at rest, and has
resolved with sitting up or using his wife's oxygen.

On [**6-24**] he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed three
vessel coronary artery disease with patent bypasses, severe
aortic stenosis, moderate left diastolic ventricular
dysfunction,
and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

An echo was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of
55%,
critical aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.8cm,
moderate aortic insufficiency, moderate mitral regurgitation,
and
moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.

He was not a Corevalve candidate due to his mixed valve disease.

-A chest CT revealed distal ascending, arch, and descending
aortic calcifications.
-Pulmonary function tests showed an FEV1 on 69% predicted
pre-drug and 77% post-drug.  FEV1/FVC pre-drug was 88% predicted
and 95% post-drug.  Dsb was 21, VAsb 5, DsbHb 21, and D/VAsbHb
was 3.6.

He returns to the [**Hospital1 **] after obtaining dental clearance for
Heparin bridge in preparation for an AVR in the morning. Three
days ago he was placed on Keflex for a possible right medial
shin cellulitis which appears today much improved.  He has also
been treated for the past week for a right eye infection, also
much
improved per patient report.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is considerable
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection
fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. Left
ventricular dysnchrony is present. There is a mild resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve,
but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is a probable vegetation on the
mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Function is difficult to assess due to likely dyssynchrony (wide
QRS). The apex may be hypokinetic. The right ventricle is not
well seen but again, is probably normal. There is a small
echodensity on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve -- see
images #81-84. This could be a vegetation, a chordal remnant or
fibrin attached to mitral annular calcification. AVR with normal
gradients, cannot exclude a vegetation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-7-24**], the
echodensity on the posterior leaflet may have been present on
the prior study also.

Intra-op TEE [**2189-7-21**]
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). A left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be
excluded. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are grade 4
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic
dissection is seen.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate central
MR.
[**Name14 (STitle) 50182**]:
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic postion. There is a
significant paravalvular leak in the area of the right coronary
cusp next to the commisure between the right and left cusps,
causing moderate AI. The peak gradient across the aortic valve
is 12mmHg, the mean gradient is 7mmHg.
The MR is now mild to moderate. Biventricular function remain
normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2189-7-20**] for Heparin bridge and
brought to the Operating Room on [**2189-7-21**] where he underwent a
redo Sternotomy and aortic valve replacement (23mm RSt. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
tissue valve).  Please see the operative note for details.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU on Propofol and
Neo Synephrine drips in stable condition for recovery. On POD 1
the patient was extubated and weaned from vasopressor support.

On POD 2 he was re-intubated fol
