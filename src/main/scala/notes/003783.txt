Chief Complaint:
Right lung cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This patient is an 83 year old female with small cell lung
cancer who was accepted in transfer from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
Patient is with known right small cell lung cancer undergoing
chemotherapy/radiation therapy at [**Hospital3 1563**] [**Hospital3 **]. She
now presents with acute respiratory falure and is status-post
intubation. The reports from the outside hospital indicate
extrinsic compression from right mainstem bronchus obstructing
the proximal airway now with complete collapse of the right
hemithorax with partial collapse of the left hemithroax. CT
scans from [**Hospital1 1562**] indicate a large volume tumor encasing the
right lung. The patient's family was advised of her dismal
prognosis, and the patient was admitted for the possibility of a
meaningful intervention with the goal of palliative therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a
bronchoscopy on [**2163-11-11**]. This revealed a completely obstructed
right upper lobe with tumor and submucosal infiltration of the
proximal right mainstem bronchus. Post-bronchoscopy, a chest
xray showed partial re-expansion of the right lower lobe. The
patient was placed on a CPAP trial the next morning, which she
passed. She was extubated for a period of a few hours. However,
due to increasing respiratory effort, the patient soon fatigued,
and required emergent re-intubation. The patient was fully
conscious at this time, and willingly indicated a desire to be
re-intubated. A repeat chest xray showed a re-accumulation of
fluid in the right hemithorax with collase of the right lower
lobe. The patient was kept intubated and on supportive care
until [**2163-11-15**], when the patient underwent a repeat bronchoscopy
and placement of a PleurX catheter on the right. This was done
in the hopes that the patient could be extubated once the
pleural effusion was cleared. However, the patient failed to
properly wean off the vent. Following on-going dialogue with the
patient's family, it was decided that the patient would be made
comfort measures only on [**2163-11-20**]. The patient was extubated and
expired several hours later.
