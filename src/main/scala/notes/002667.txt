Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pacemaker placed [**6-5**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a [**Age over 90 **] yo female who presented to the ED from her
[**Hospital3 **] with lethargy and a question of low BP. Pt had
an unwitnessed fall 2 days prior to presentation, but the
details of this fall/syncope are not known. In the ED she was
found to have a HR in the 30s with 2:1 block on her EKG. Her
blood pressures remained stable with this rate. She was seen by
cardiology who recommended correcting electrolytes (hyponatemia)
and suggested no need for emergent temporary pacer if she
remains HD stable. She was also hypoxic to 70s on RA. She has a
documented DNR/DNI, so was placed on a NRB. She was given 10 IV
lasix, 600cc IVFs, Levo/Flagyl and transferred to ICU. Upon
arrival her BP remained stable and she was A/A and oriented. Per
ED discussion with HCP - patient would want a pacemaker placed
and would want heart rate treated w/ medicines but remains
DNR/DNI.

Echo [**6-4**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
IMP/Plan: [**Age over 90 **] F w/ HTN, CAD p/w bradycardia and hypoxia presented
to hospital following possible syncopal episode 2d prior to
admission.

1) Bradycardia: Patient was admitted with HR in 30s and 2:1
block seen on EKG.  She was DNR/DNI but PCP was amenable to
pacemaker placement and medical treatment. Etiology of heart
block was not clear but suspected worsening of baseline
conduction disease (RBB + LAFB at baseline).  CEs were cycled
and were negative and electrolytes were repleted.  She was
monitored in the MICU and transiently went in and out of
complete heart block. She had pacer pads in place and atropine
at the bedside. B/c her BPs were stable, cardiology did not
think she needed a temporary pacemaker placed urgently. She had
a permanent pacemaker placed on [**6-5**] with backup rate of 60.
She remained hemodynamically stable after pacemaker placement
and transfer to floor.

2) Hypoxia: Patient was tachypneic and hypoxic at admission.
Her cxr and exam were c/w with pulmonary edema likely secondary
to bradycardia.  She did have a cough so could not exclude
pneumonia but she did not have a fever, WBC, or elevated
lactate.   Her initial ABG showed a respiratory alkalosis likely
secondary to hyperventilation from hypoxia.  She was placed on a
NRB and O2 SATS remain just above 90% on NRB. She was started
empirically on levaquin and flagyl for possible PNA and was
given lasix for diuresis. She was diuresed over the course of
her stay and her respiratory status improved. her abx were
changed from levo to ceftriaxone b/c of concern for prolongning
the QT interval on levaquin. Patient completed a 72 hr course of
Ceftriaxone.  She was transferred to the floor on [**6-8**] where she
was weaned off oxygen.

3) Anemia: After patient was transferred to the floor, her hct
dropped significantly.  She received 2U PRBC with appropriate
response of hct back to pt baseline.

4) Hyponatremia: Patient had sodium of 119 at admission.  The
diff dx was hypovolemia (dehydration vs infection) vs CHF.  Her
sodium improved significantly with diuresis.  Sodium remains
stable.

5) Renal insufficiency: Cr remained at basline at 1.2.

6) HTN: Anti-hypertensive meds were initially held. After PM was
placed she was started on nifedepine 10 qd but her BPs dropped
significantly. She was slowly uptitrated on a low dose BB.  Pt's
home dose nifedipine was held secondary to

7) Hyperlipidemia: Patient was restarted on home dose of
Lipitor.

8) Depression: Patient was restarted on home dose of Celexa,
brought in by patient.

9) FEN: Patient is on a dysphagia diet at home.  During her stay
she was initially too tachypneic to tolerate POs. She was then
evaluated by S&S who were concerned for aspiration risk, so she
was started on PPN with plans to repeat the swallow eval in
several days.  Upon repeat evaluation it was determined patient
may take pureed solids and honey thickened liquids.

10) Access: LIJ placed [**6-4**], but removed on [**6-6**] by EP under
fluoro after PM placed.
Midline placed by IR on [**6-6**].

11) Code status: DNR/DNI
