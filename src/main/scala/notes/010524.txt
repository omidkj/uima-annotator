Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
"My fistula wasn't flowing right."


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left AV Venogram
Left AV Thrombectomy

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yom w/PMHx significant for CAD, CHF, CABG, HTN, Atrial
fibrilliation, Ventricular Brady-paced, Hyperlipidemia renal CA,
s/p left nephrectomy in ESRD, HD dependent who presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] 24hrs prior via his dialysis clinic.
.
Daughter reports weakness of the extremities over the weekend
following Fri HD c/w previous episodes of hyperkalemia. He then
presented this Mon for regularly scheduled HD per MWF schedule
through left arm AV graft which was complicated my apparent clot
of the graft.
.
Pt was then sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] for HD. On arrival at the [**Hospital1 18**] pt
was noted to have hyperkalemia w/K of 8.1. He received calclium
gluconate, insulin and bicarbonate for correction of
hyperkalemia. Pt was admitted to the ICU and femoral access was
obtained for HD and was subsequently dialysed via the femoral
access. On hospital day two patient was taken to the
interventional suite and clot lysis was attempted without
apparent success. Pt was then evaluated by the vascular surgery
team and planned for transfer to medicine.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) Left Arm AV Graft Failure: Pt presented w/clot of left arm AV
graft and access for emergent HD right femoral access was
obtained and emplyed for HD. Pt was then taken to the IR suite
and thrombectomy of the left AV graft was attempted w/o success.
A venogram of the region was also obtained. Post intervention
the pt experienced a bleed of the left arm access site which was
monitored by IR overnight, pressure was applied though slow
leaking bleed persisted overnight the day of procedure. At the
time of procedure INR was 2.5 and coumadin was held and on post
intervention day one had decreased to 2.1 and the bleed stopped.
Based on the failed thrombectomy renal transplant surgery was
consulted for long term access for HD. Pt was planned for left
proximal AV fistula w/permcath placement in the interim. Pt
underwent repeat venogram of more proximal vessels in
preparation for surgery.
Pt was planned for routine HD via femoral cath. The day of IR
intervention, overnight the femoral cath was associated
w/proximal tenderness and local bleed externally which resolved
w/pressure and occlusive dressing, no signs/symptoms of
significant internal bleeding were noted. On the day prior to
discharge, the patient had a new AV fistula placed on his
proximal LUE. He also had a permacath placed on the Left side
(IJ). The patient was dialyzed through the permacath on the day
of discharge without incident. He developed slight oozing from
his new graft site after dialysis, thought to be related to
heparin given during HD. He was discharged with dressings and
instruction to return with any symptoms, such as
lightheadedness, CP.
.
#) Anemia: HCT as low as 26.4 though pt asymptomatic: w/o
orthostatic signs, lightheadedness, no feelings of fatigue,
AOx3. Drop in HCT from 30 is likely [**1-1**] bleed over the previous
24-48hrs following IR access. At that time RBC was noted to have
dropped w/o drop in HCT. I suspect the HCT did not change at
that time due to the acute nature of the bleed and at this time
his fluids have re-equilibrated and now the HCT reflects the
blood loss as well as the RBC. The patient received 1U PRBC
prior to graft surgery and permacath placement.
.
#) Hyperkalemia: Pt was noted on admission to have hyperkalemia
w/potassium of 8.1. Renal was consulted and pt received calcium
gluconate, bicarbonate and insulin and then sent for emergent
hemodialysis. Post HD potassium was noted to be 5.6. On the
second day of admission potassium was again elevated to 6.2 and
patient was taken to hemodialysis. It was determined to repeat
HD as this also would coincide w/regularly scheduled HD regimen
and avoid side effects of kayexolate. It was also decided to
discontinue ACEi as it was considered to be contributing to
hyperkalemia.
.
#) Cardiovascular: PMHx significant for CAD, CHF and
Hyperlipidemia. On presentation pt w/o SOB, CP, Dyspnea,
Syncope. On transfer from the MICU to the medicine floor exam
revealed BP 90s/40 pt reported baseline low pressures of 100s
systolic. Pressures low likely secondary to HD w/1kg taken off.
Pt w/o orthostatic signs and was asymptomatic. Over the next
24hrs pressures corrected and had increased to 110s/70s without
intervention.
.
#) ESRD: Pt w/hx of renal CA and left nephrectomy. ESRD w/HD
dependency. HD per HD team was maintained via femoral access
until alternative permanent access placed by the renal
transplant team. The patient left the hospital with a graft in
his L arm, a permacath on the L (IJ). The R fem line was
discontinued.
.
#) Atrial Fibrillation: Pt w/hx of afib and maintained on
coumadin 3mg qhs as oupt. The patient's coumadin was temporarily
held prior to surgery for graft placement. The patient was
discharged back on coumadin 3mg QHS.

Medications on Admission:
