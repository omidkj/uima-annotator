Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year-old male with PMH significant for AS, pafib,
and COPD who presented to OSH with wheezing, cough and changes
in mental status. He was transfered from [**Hospital6 28728**]
Center for evaluation and management of his tracheomalacia on
[**8-16**]. The patient had an episode of hypercarbic respiratory
failure on his initial day of admission to the OSH requiring
BiPAP. He was treated with antibiotics and steroids. His
troponin rose to 0.8 x2 as well at that time. He also had an
elevated ddimer at that time, 1.06 (range of 0-0.49). When SBPs
high, would require bipap, when normotensive was tolerating 1L
NC. Ruled out for PE and pneumonia. Was treated for COPD
exaccerbation at [**Location (un) 1121**].
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was seen by IP to evaluate his
tracehobronchomalacia. It was believed his respiratory failure
was multifactorial from TBM, AS, COPD, CHF, poor lung reserve.
While on the floor, he had flash pulmonary edema in setting of
SBPs in 200s and was transferred to the SICU. He required bipap
and was able to be weaned off when his blood pressures
normalized.

Pertinent Results:
CT Trachea:
Multiple respiratory movements limit the evaluation of the lung
parenchyma.
Mild centrilobular emphysema is mostly in upper lobes. 2-mm
right upper lobe
lung nodules are present (4:106 and 5:109). Right upper lobe
subpleural ill-
defined opacity is present. Expiration images are very
suboptimal. Collapse
of bronchus intermedius down to 2 mm (9:132) suggests
bronchomalacia. There is
no significant collapse of the trachea, accounting for a
suboptimal study.
Bilateral bronchial wall thickening is more prominent in both
lower lobes.
Biapical scarring is present. Left fissural thickening is
present and
associated with lingular and bibasilar atelectasis. Bilateral
pleural
effusion are small. Right pulmonary artery enlargement up to 29
mm suggests
pulmonary hypertension. Severe calcifications of the aortic
valve are
present. Calcifications of the mitral annulus, coronary
arteries, and aorta
are also present. A stent is in the LAD. Multiple calcified
mediastinal and
bilateral hilar lymph nodes are present but not enlarged using
CT criteria.
Incidentally, lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum
is present.
Bones are normal except to note old left seventh and eighth rib
fracture.

Although this study was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation, the
upper abdomen is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Suboptimal study with multiple respiratory movements.
2. Mild centrilobular emphysema.
3. Collapse of the bronchus intermedius suggests bronchomalacia.
No air
trapping in expiration.
4. Sub-3-mm lung nodules do not warrant further followup if
there is no risk
factor for neoplasia. If the patient is a smoker, followup in
one year is
recommended.
5. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening, more prominent in lower
lobes suggests
peribronchial inflammation.
6. Small bilateral pleural effusion. Left fissural thickening
with lingular
and dependent atelectasis.
7. Severe calcifications of the aortic valve are of unknown
hemodynamic significance.
8. Multiple calcified mediastinal and bihilar lymph nodes
suggest prior
granulomatous disease.
9. Coronary artery calcifications and stent, aortic
calcifications, and
mitral annulus calcifications.
10. Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.

Cardiac Catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
non-obstructive and branch vessel disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD revealed a patent
stent in
the proximal vessel and a 90% stenosis in the D1 branch, which
was small
to moderate in size.  The LCx had a 60% lesion in the
mid-vessel. The
RCA had a 30% stenosis in the mid-vessel.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left
heart
pressures with a mean RA of 9mmHg and mean PCWP of 13mmHg.  The
cardiac
index was preserved at 3.2 l/min/m2. There was mild systemic
arterial
hypertension with a central aortic systolic pressure of 144mmHg.
3. There was moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of
36mmHg and
a calculated valve area of 0.94cm2.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries revealed non-obstructive disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.94cm2.
3. Mildly elevated right and left heart filling pressures.
.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.
