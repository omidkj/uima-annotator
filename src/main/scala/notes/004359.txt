Chief Complaint: Transferred from OSH for NSTEMI/CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80-year-old female patient with history of COPD and
presumed CAD and CHF who presented to [**Location (un) 16843**] ED the day
prior to trasnfer to [**Hospital1 18**] with chief complaint of SOB. CXR was
consistent with CHF and BNP was 727. The patient was intubated
for hypoxia to 80% on room air. The patient was given solumedrol
and lasix in the ED and sent to the ICU. In the ICU, the patient
was diuresed with lasix and placed on NTG gtt. Her cardiac
enzymes was initially flat but subsequent enzymes returned
elevated with CK 1796 and trop I 34. Echocardiogram showed EF
approximately 30% without previous baseline. She received plavix
300 mg and Lovenox (last dose at 10 am the day of transfer). She
also received Lopressor 2 mg IV and was placed on insulin gtt 4
Units/hour with her last FSBS of 147. She has an elevated
creatine at 1.6 and her WBC is now 18.6. She is in a sinus
rhythm and EKG shows ST depressions in the inferoanterior leads.

.
Today, cardiac cath revealed severe 3-vessel disease not
suitable for PCI (80% LMCA, RCA 80% ostial, long mid disease to
80%, Lcx with 80%, LAD small vessel with moderate disease at
D1).  PA 55/38/45, mean PWCP 36, CI 2.26, CO 3.92, LV 110/40.
CT surgery was consulted and reviewed the cath but declined
surgery secondary to poor target site.  The patient was noted to
have severe PVD including aortoiliac disease, and IABP was not
able to be placed for CHF.  Swan ganz was placed to monitor
hemodynamics.
.
Currently, patient is sedated and intubated, therefore unable to
answer any questions regarding current symptoms or review of
systems.

[**2-22**] Cath
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system

revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
was a
short diffusely disease vessel with an 80% stenosis.  The LAD
was a
small vessel with moderate disease throughout.  The LCx was a
small
vessel with diffuse disease to 80% in the mid vessel.  The RCA
had an
80% ostial stenosis and diffuse disease to 80% in the mid
vessel.
2.  Limited hemodynamics demonstrated pulmonary arterial
hypertension
with a pulmonary artery pressure of 56/36 mmHg.  The left
ventricular
end diastolic pressure was 36 mmHg.  Central aortic pressure was
107/60
mmHg.  There was no gradient across the aortic or mitral valve.
Cardiac
index was perserved at 2.5 l/min/m2.  Right ventricular and
right atrial
pressures were not obtained.
3.  Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
.
[**2-22**] ECHO
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views.
Suboptimal image quality - ventilator. Emergency study performed
by the
cardiology fellow on call.

Conclusions:
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. Left
ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the
left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely
depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the distal LV
and apex.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is mild global
right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot
be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2-24**] CXR
Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in standard position.
Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable in size.
Vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness are present
consistent with mild CHF. Within the right upper lobe, a new
focal opacity has developed with associated slight elevation of
the minor fissure. This is most likely due to an area of
atelectasis but aspiration should also be considered in the
appropriate clinical setting. Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities
are likely due to atelectasis, and there are probable small
pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 year-old female with CAD, CHF, [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from OSH for
NSTEMI and CHF causing respiratory failure.  The patient was
transferred intubated and on a ventilator.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed severe 3-vessel disease. The patient's
anatomy was not suitable for PCI and cardiac surgery declined
due to poor targets.  Echocardiogram revealed ischemic
cardiomyopathy with worsened ejection fraction of [**9-27**]%.  The
patient was not a candidate for IABP due to severe PVD involving
the aortoiliac system.  The patient's family was made aware of
her poor prognosis.  The patient was initially managed in the
CCU with lasix gtt despite worsening creatinine.  The patient
did not improve after 24 hours and blood pressure was tenuous.
The [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy and family were made aware of
the poor prognosis.  After discussion with the family, the goals
of care were changed to comfort.  The patient expired [**2188-2-24**]
at 13:15.
