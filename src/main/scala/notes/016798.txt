LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  His hematocrit was 40.5.  His
Chem-7 was sodium of 137, potassium of 4.0, chloride is 96,
bicarb of 16, BUN of 8, creatinine of 0.9, glucose of 86.
His anion gap was about 15.  His LFTs were elevated.  His ALT

distal ducts were visualized.  This study was unchanged from
previous right upper quadrant ultrasounds.

He had a KUB done, which showed no dilated loops of large or
small bowel.  There was no free air seen.

He had a chest x-ray done, which showed two old rib
fractures, but otherwise there was no cardiopulmonary
disease.

The patient was admitted to Medicine for pancreatitis and
alcohol withdrawal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Alcohol withdrawal:  The patient was monitored on the CIWA
   scale.  He was given 5-10 mg of Valium prn CIWA greater
   than 10.  On the evening of admission shortly after
   arrival to the floor, the patient did have a seizure,
   which was presumably from alcohol withdrawal.  Shortly
   after the seizure, the patient went into V-fib arrest and
   was intubated for airway protection.

He was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  During
the Intensive Care Unit course, he was on an Ativan drip for
withdrawal.  He was then transitioned over to prn standing
and prn Valium and kept on a CIWA scale.  He was continued on
folate, thiamine, and multivitamin, and once he was extubated
alert and oriented, he did meet with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2411**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2412**] from the
Addiction Services.  He again declined all 12-step programs,
but said that he would continue to followup with his SMART
program.

1. Cardiovascular:  He had a V-fib arrest.  He was
   defibrillated.  His cardiac enzymes were monitored until
   they peaked and trended down.  He had serial EKGs done.
   His blood pressure regimen was changed slightly while he
   was in the Intensive Care Unit.  He was on metoprolol
   instead of his propanolol.  Continued on his ACE
   inhibitor.  He was monitored on telemetry for about one
   week with no significant events, no further episodes of
   ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia.

1. Pancreatitis:  The patient was kept NPO for his
   pancreatitis once he was awake and extubated and his
   abdominal pain has cleared.  His diet was advanced as
   tolerated.

1. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 30 percent:  The
   patient's I's and O's were monitored throughout his
   hospital course and he was euvolemic at the time of
   discharge.

1. Hepatitis:  The patient's liver function tests, AST was
   greater than ALT, this was consistent with his history of
   alcoholic hepatitis.  There was no evidence of gallstones
   on his right upper quadrant ultrasound.  His LFTs were
   followed until they began to trend down towards normal.

1. HIV:  The patient has a questionable history of HIV.  He
   refused followup HIV testing.

1. Anxiety:  The patient was continued on his propanolol and
   was restarted on his Klonopin once he was extubated for
   anxiety control.

1. Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated for airway
   protection.  After the alcohol withdrawal seizure, he was
   extubated without events after two days.

1. Neurologic:  The patient's seizure was likely from alcohol
   withdrawal.  He did have a MRI done to further evaluate
   for any structural cause of seizures, but the MRI was
   within normal limits except for some hippocampal atrophy.
   The patient refused a LP.

The patient was discharged to home on [**2160-4-24**].
