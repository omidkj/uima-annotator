Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**2178-2-26**] s/p liver biopsy for follow up of rejection
that was treated with solumedrol. Complained of right pleuritic
chest pain since the day before. He had some shortness of breath
as well. He was admitted to the MICU and had a chest CT that
revealed a right pulmonary artery saddle embolus. Results
revealed the following: CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are
tubular shaped filling defects extending across the bifurcation
of the main pulmonary arteries. In addition, filling defects are
seen at the branch points of the right main pulmonary artery and
left main pulmonary artery with extension into the segmental
pulmonary arteries. There is flow in the subsegmental pulmonary
arteries but a paucity of opacification of the right lower lobe
vessels. Lung windows demonstrate a patchy area of consolidation
in the posterior right lower lobe. There are no pleural or
pericardial effusions. No axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
lymphadenopathy. The heart and pericardium are within normal
limits.
Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are remarkable for two
rounded low attenuation areas in the right hepatic lobe of fluid
density.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reformatted images
confirm the above axial findings. Value grade I.
IMPRESSION:
1) Extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism involving major, lobar
and segmental divisions.
2) Patchy right lower lobe consolidation.
3) Two rounded low attenuation hepatic foci of fluid density.

Given this report, he was initiated on IV heparin. O2 sat was in
80s. He was placed on a non-rebreather 50%. He was
hemodynamically stable. CT surgery was consulted to evaluate for
embolectomy. Evaluation revealed that he was not a candidate for
surgical intervention at this stage. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] (vascular
medicine/cardiology attending) was consulted to evaluate for
thrombolysis. After consultation with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **], a
IVC filter was placed  on [**2178-2-27**] via left brachial site without
complication. Please see procedure note for further details.

On HD 1 he was transferred to the SICU where  he spiked a
temperature of 103.5. He was pancultured for fever. He was
hydrated with IV D5W with bicarbonate and heparin was adjusted
by q2 hour coags. His ABG was improved. Bilateral leg duplex
ultrasound was done revealing old small clot in L SFV.

On HD 3 he was experiencing increaed chest pain on the left
side. This was concerning for reinfarction of lung. A cardiac
echo revealed the following:  The left atrium was normal in
size. Overall left ventricular systolic function
appeared normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion
abnormality could not be fully excluded. Right ventricular
systolic function
appeared normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appearred
structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appeared
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid
regurgitation was seen. There was moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There was no pericardial effusion.Compared with
the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2177-12-28**],
there was no diagnostic change.  An ekg was done that suggested
signs of strain with rate of 110 in NSR. Twave was down in
Va5-V6, Inferior and lateral leads. Cardiology was asked to
evaluate. Findings were reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] and a repeat CTA
was suggested to assess stability of the thrombus.  A cxr
revealed no acute changes.

Zosyn and vancomycin were started for fever and IV fluid changed
to D51/2NS at 75. Urine output was good, pain was controlled
with prn iv dilaudid and nebs were given. O2 sat was 99% on 50%
face mask. He received a unit of PRBC on [**2-28**] for a hematocrit of
26.

Neurology was consulted on HD 4 for medication review for
history of seizures and myoclonus. He was noted to be quite
ataxic on exam. Continuation of clonazepam and keppra were
recommended as well as corrected dilantin level of 15-20.
Recommended eventual taper of dilantin with Keppra as
monotherapy, but not in the acute care setting due to high risk
of seizure. Dilantin was increased to 100mg tid with an extra
dose given for corrected level of 10.9.

On [**3-2**] he was noted to be breathing better. Cultures were
normal. A CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST was
done for persistent elevated LFTs. This revealed:  The lung base
images reveal the known PE demonstrated as big filling defects
within the lower lobe arteries blaterally. There is a large
consolidation within the right lower lobe, demonstrating either
pneumonia or unusual infarct.
The transplanted liver demonstrates numerous low-attenuation
lesions throughout both lobes of the liver, all of them small,
up to 3 cm except for one in segment V of the liver, which
measures 6 x 4 cm. There is no enhancement within or around any
of these lesions and there is no free air within them. They all
demonstrate fluid attenuation, around 10 Hounsfield units.
Periportal edema is demonstrated. There is no intra- or
extrahepatic biliary dilatation. No arterial supply is
demonstrated within the liver and a hepatic artery is
demonstrated only proximally outside the liver. The portal vein,
hepatic veins and IVC are patent. There are no enhancing lesions
within the liver. There is a trace amount of f
