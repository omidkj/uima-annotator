[**10-4**] CXR IMPRESSION: Interval development of mild congestive
heart failure
superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial lung
disease. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are similar to prior.

[**10-14**] EGD Impression: A small AVM at 34cm in the lower third of
the esophagus.
Medium hiatal hernia
Mucosa suggestive of short segment Barrett's esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
#Hospital Acquired PNA: Pt was initially admitted to the ICU
with fevers and hypotension.  He was treated empirically with
Vanc, Cefepime, fluids and stress dose steroids for presumed
HAP.  He seemed to improve clinically over the first few days.
However, he developed worsening fevers and RLL infiltrate on
this antibiotic regimen.  He was broadened to Vanc, Cefepime,
Cipro and was noted to clinically improve with decreased
congestion and resolution of fevers.  He comnpleted an 8 day
course of the regimen of Vanc and Cefepime, and he will complete
his 8 day course of cipro as an outpatient (4 days remaining).
At the time of discharge, he was satting well on home O2 of 2-3L
NC.
.
#Acute blood loss [**Month/Year (2) **]: Pt was noted to have a dropping
hematocrit soon after admission with black guaic positive
stools.  Aspirin/Plavix were stopped and pt was seen by GI.  He
underwent EGD to evaluate for the source of bleed, although no
site of bleed was identified.  He was noted to have a small
segement suspicious for [**Last Name (un) **] esophagus during the EGD, so he
was discharged on [**Hospital1 **] pantoprazole.  He was recommended to have
colonoscopy, to which he initially consented, however he
subsequently refused [**Last Name (un) **] prep, and therefore this was deferred
to outpatient followup.
.
#Adrenal Insufficiency: Pt was stress dosed on admission to the
ICU and his steroid regimen was tapered. He was discharged back
on his home regimen of Hydrocortisone 10 mg po q am and 5 mg po
q afternoon.
.
#Chronic systolic dysfunction: Pt was aggressively volume
resuscitated in the ICU and was subsequently restarted on his
home regimen of Spironolactone 25mg daily and Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **]
after BP normalized on the floor.  Pt was given additional lasix
with
