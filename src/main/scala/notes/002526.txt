suture repair of bleeding right graft to common iliac artery
anastomosis.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 57 yo male s/p aortic dissection repair in [**2117**]
followed distal arch repair via left thoractomy in [**2119**]. He
recently presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2126-2-1**] for a subdural
hematoma following a fall. This was managed conservatively by
the neurosurgery service. CTA at that time revealed a large
thoracic/abdominal aortic aneurysm with associated dissection.
The dissection extended distally from the area that was
previously repaired in [**2119**]. Vascular surgery was consulted and
they did not recommend surgery at that time but arranged for him
to be seen as an outpatient by both vascular and cardiac
surgeons. He was seen in [**Month (only) **] for surgical discussion and
planning presents today for preadmission testing for surgery
tomorrow. Currently, he denies chest, abdominal and back pain
and is feeling well.

Pertinent Results:
[**2126-9-10**] ECHO
PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale
is present. A small amount of intermittent left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). Right ventricular free wall
function is borderline normal. The descending thoracic aorta is
markedly dilated and tortuous. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. A mobile density is seen in the
descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. There is flow in the false lumen. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POST BYPASS The patient is on infusions of epinephrine,
norepinephrine, and nitroglycerin and is in sinus rhythm. Left
ventricular function is globally improved (LVEF=50-55%). Mild
aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation remain. The
descending aortic graft which measures approximately 2.8-2.9 cm
in diameter is seen with good flow. Proximal ascending aorta is
intact.

[**2126-9-13**] CT of spine
1. No obvious intraspinal pathology. Evaluation of the spinal
canal is
markedly limited without intrathecal contrast. If there is
clinical concern for cauda equina or cord compression, MRI
should be performed.
2. Lines and tubes as described with changes of recent aortic
surgery.
3. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation

[**2126-9-24**] Ultrasound
The left internal jugular vein
demonstrates fairly extensive thrombus inferiorly, which is
incompletely
occlusive. This is essentially unchanged since the prior study
without
propagation or interval lysis. The left subclavian vein appears
normal with normal color flow and respiratory variation.

[**2126-9-24**] CT Scan
1. Bilateral lung infiltrates worse on the right that are
consistent with
aspiration or infection. Left pleural effusion and atelectasis.
2. Marked inflammatory change throughout left chest wall and
anterior
abdominal wall, and findings that suggest extravasation of oral
contrast from the stomach into the base of the anterior wall
incision consistent with enterocutaneous fistula. There may be
tracking of oral contrast into the chest wall as well.
3. Free fluid is seen in the abdomen and retroperitoneum without
evidence of organized fluid collections.
4. Postoperative changes associated with thoracoabdominal AAA
repair, not
well evaluated on this noncontrast examination

[**2126-9-14**] MRI Spine
There is no evidence of hematoma within the spine seen in the
lumbar region. Evaluation of the conus is slightly limited but
no abnormal signal or compression seen. Paraspinal soft tissues
are unremarkable. There is no significant disc bulge or
herniation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2126-9-10**] for surgical
management of his thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. He was taken
to the operating room where he underwent a Repair of his
thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with a 28-mm Vascutek
multibranched graft with separate anastomoses to the celiac
artery, superior mesenteric artery, right and left renal
arteries and an aortobi-iliac graft with a 24 x 12 Hemashield
graft. Please see operative note for details.

Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He was noted to be hypotensive following his
surgery, hematocrit down to 19 from 29 preop in first hour
post-op, transfused 5 units of blood to a Hct of 23 and
ultimately was returned to the operating room on [**2126-9-11**] for a
re-exploration for bleeding with evacuation of hematoma and
suture repair of the bleeding right graft to common
iliac artery anastomosis.  Please see operative note for
additional details.

Post-operatively, the Mr. [**Known lastname **] was hemodynamically stable.  His
Cr was elevated to 3.2 but urine output was stable.  A renal
consult was obtained indicating no need for dialysis but close
monitoring.  He was intubated, sedated and paralyzed in the ICU
with a chest tube, NGT and JP drain.

On physical exam, b/l leg edema had developed and was worsening.
He was taken back to the OR on [**2126-9-12**] for another washout of
the abdomen along with
