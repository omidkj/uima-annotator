Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
Bile lead s/p cholecystectomy requiring ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP
Mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 61-year-old man with ETOH and cocaine abuse, CHF w/ EF
15% who presented to an OSH on [**3-6**] with abdominal pain and
sepsis.  He was found to have a gangrenous gallbladder, and
underwent surgical resection on [**3-7**] with percutaneous drain
placement.  Cultures grew alpha hemolytic streptocoocus.  This
procedure was complicated by a bile leak, and he was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital 86340**] medical intensive care unit, patient was
intubated and mildly sedated but responsive and following
commands.  He was on vasopressin with a systolic blood pressure
in the 90-100 range.  Antibiotics included: vancomycin, zosyn,
and levofloxacin.
.

congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

Past Medical History:
--CHF - EF 15%, [**2169**], thought to be due to ETOH and cocaine
--COPD
--Hypertension
--ETOH abuse
--Cocaine abuse
--Colitis, details unknown
--ARF
--RBBB
--History of CVA

Social History:
ETOH - reports he drinks enough to pass out daily (about 3
shots/day).  However, on discharge, patient states that he has
"quit everything": alcohol, smoking, and all illicits.

Family History:
Patient denies any family history of HTN, DM, high cholesterol,
or heart disease.  He states his brother just passed away 2
months ago from cancer (unsure of what kind).

Physical Exam:
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema
Skin:  warm and dry

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2174-3-9**].
FINDINGS: Exam is limited by underexposed technique.
Endotracheal tube terminates about 6.6 cm above the carina, and
a nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm. Heart is
enlarged, and there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities are present, as well as small
bilateral pleural effusions with some intrafissural extension on
the right.
.
ERCP. [**2174-3-9**].
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful A straight tip
0.025 in, 270cm visiglide wire was placed. Extravasation was
noted at the cystic duct remnant. Large flow of contrast noted,
consistent with clinically suspected bile leak. Limited view of
intrahepatic ducts, no evidence of leak at ducts of luschka.  An
9cm by 10FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully
using a Oasis 10FR stent introducer kit.  Stent placed in common
hepatic duct with excellent drainage of bile.  No immediate
complications
.
Echo [**2174-3-10**].
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
15-20%). Regional distribution of LV dysfunction (apical
segments marginally more contractile than the base) argues for a
non-coronary etiology of the cardiomyopathy, although this is by
no means a definitive assessment. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction. Preserved right ventricular systolic function. No
clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
.
CT Abdomen/pelvis.
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent fluid and fat stranding seen in the region of the
gallbladder fossa, corresponding to the extraluminal biliary
leak seen during ERCP.
2. Minimal stranding about the pancreatic tail, possibly related
to uncomplicated pancreatitis.
3. Degenerative changes in the spine.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40612**] is a 61 year old with alcohol abuse, gangrenous gall
bladder s/p surgical cholecystectomy complicated by bile leak,
transferred from OSH for ERCP.  His hospital course was
complicated by septic shock, persistent fevers, and prolonged
intubation.  He was initially admitted to the ICU, and then to
the general cardiac floor.

# GANGRENOUS GALLBLADDER S/P SURGICAL RESECTION WITH BIL LEAK:
Treated with drainage at OSH, on imipenem/vancomycin/flagyl on
transfer. On admission, patient underwent ERCP with stenting of
the CBD. He was kept on antibiotics with cefepime/flagyl/vanco
with improvement in his condition.  Abdominal U/S done on [**2174-3-9**]
showed no ascites or evidence of abscess. The patient will
require removal of the CBD stent within one month of placement
per ERCP recs. General surgery was consulted and recommended
supportive care, weaned ventilation, and broad spectrum
antibiotics. A CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast done on [**2174-3-10**]
showed no free gas or fluid in the pelvis and no pelvic sidewall
or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  The JP drain was monitored and had
ongoing small amounts of drainage; drain will remain in place
until patient has follow-up outpatient ERCP.  LFTs were
monitored and found to be within normal limits.

On [**2174-3-14**], vancomycin and cefepime were stopped, and Mr. [**Known lastname 40612**]
was put on cipro and flagyl.  He was noted to spike a temp of
103F on [**2174-3-15**], so he was pan cultured again and Zosyn was added
on for extra gram negative coverage; he required pressors
intermittently during this time for low SBPs in the 70s.
Despite multiple cultures, no source of infection was found.
However, the patient's leukocytosis was noted to eventually
resolve, and all antibiotics were stopped on [**2174-3-20**].

# SEPTIC SHOCK:  Mr. [**Known lastname 40612**] had been on vasopressin at the time
of transfer from the OSH but as he was HD stable, this was
discontinued on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU.  He was treated with IV
vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl and despite improvements in his
WBC, he continued to spike fevers through [**3-13**].  His antibiotics
were changed to ciprofloxacin/flagyl on [**2174-3-14**]; as noted above,
Zosyn was added on [**2174-3-15**].  The patient was noted to have a drug
rash with Zosyn, so was transiently switched to Meropenem.  All
antibiotics were discontinued on [**2174-3-20**].  The patient remained
afebrile, HD stable, and without leukocytosis.

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Patient remained intubated during much
of his hospital stay for altered mental status, abdominal
distention, volume status, and COPD.  Patient was gradually
weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated on
[**2174-3-20**]. Patient was transferred to the floor for further
management and was doing well, but was noted to have an
increased oxygen requirement of 6L NC in the setting of SBP in
the 80s (his baseline) and in apparent fluid overload.  He was
transferred back to the ICU on [**3-24**] for diuresis and close
monitoring of his blood pressure. He was given his home dose of
torsemide and diuresed well over the next 4 days until transfer
to cardiology service (because of CHF) when he was satting 95
