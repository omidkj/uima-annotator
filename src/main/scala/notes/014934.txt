Chief Complaint:
cough, fever, AMS, and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation x2

History of Present Illness:
83 year old female with diastolic dysfuntion, COPD on 2L NC,
OSA, afib on ASA, who presents with AMS and hypoxia. The patient
notes that she had been feeling well until today. She states
that around the time her neighbor picked her up to take her to
her doctor's appointment that she began feeling unwell with
shortness of breath and cough. She describes her cough as
productive of light tan sputum. She denies any fever or chills,
no N/V/D, no abd pain. She does not feel confused.
.
Her neighbor took her to [**Hospital1 18**] for outpt evaluation. Her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **] saw her in the waiting room. Per OMR notes, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30906**]
stated that " She is very lethargic and falls asleep during
conversation with me. She states that she feels slightly short
of breath." Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] arranged for transport to the ED.
.
Of note, she was recently discharged on [**12-9**] after an admission
for viral gastroenteritis and renal failure. She was noted to
have hypotension to SBP 80's and cr 1.5 both of which responted
to fluids and was attributed to dehydration in the setting of
poor PO intake.
.
In the ED, there was a question of facial droop in triage which
was not present on evaluation in the ED. Her neighbor who was
with her on arrival at the ED states the patient was wandering
around mumbling.The patient had fever to 103, cough and
hypotension down to SBP 80'S requiring 4L NS. Lactate nl 1.3 and
0.9. But given persisent hypotension, central line was placed
and levophed started. CXR showed multifocal PNA vs edema, but
given clinical picture of fever and cough, it was thought that
she had PNA. The patient was given Vanc, Ceftaz and Levofloxacin
as well as tamiflu. She was swabed for flu as well. She was also
noted to be hypoxic to 88% on RA and required 4-5LNC to
oxygenate 92%. pH 7.32 pCO252 pO2 58.

CXR PA & Lat ([**2150-12-14**]): There is a left-sided pacemaker with
leads terminating appropriately within the right atrium and
right ventricle, there are multiple surgical clips within the
left upper abdomen.  There is stable, mild cardiomegaly. The
aorta is mildly tortuous. There is a prominent right
paratracheal opacity, consistent with regional vascular ectasia.


There are increased interstitial markings bilaterally, worse on
the right, compatible with mild congestion. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. There is diffuse osteopenia, seen in
prior radiographs.

CXR ([**2150-12-16**]): Worsening right upper lobe and improved right
lower lobe consolidation with stable mild superimposed pulmonary
edema.

RUE Ultrasound ([**2150-12-16**]): No evidence of deep vein thrombosis
involving the right upper extremity. Please note the right
internal jugular vein was not assessed.

CXR (Portable) [**2150-12-25**]: IMPRESSION:  1) Interval improvement in
the mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. 2) Unchanged small right
pleural effusion with a new retrocardiac left lower lobe
opacity, most likely due to atelectasis.

KUB [**2150-12-27**]: Essentially unremarkable examination of the
abdomen. No evidence of obstruction. CT may be helpful if
further evaluation is clinically indicated.

CT chest [**2150-12-31**]: Left lower lobe consolidation with bronchial
wall thickening and endobronchial mucus impaction. Multiple
pulmonary nodules, most of which are stable back to [**2145**]/[**2146**]
with the exception of new nodules in the superior segment of the
right lower lobe  and in the upper lobes could be due to
concurrent infection, followup chest CT is recommended in three
months to evaluate interval change. Stable mediastinal lymph
node enlargement. Wedge compression fractures in the thoracic
spine.Pulmonary arterial enlargement suggests pulmonary arterial
hypertension. The study and the report were reviewed by the
staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 83 yo F with COPD on 2L home O2, diastolic HF,
PAF (not on coumadin) who presented with fever, cough, AMS and
hypotension and was admitted to ICU. She was found to be in
respiratory failure and sepsis. She required intubation and
subsequently was found positive for H1N1 Flu. Her course was
complicated by MRSA pneumonia and difficult extubation (She was
extubated, but had to be reintubated due to ongoing respiratory
failure). She finished a 10 day course of Oseltamavir and
Vancomycin. Her respiratory status improved, though not back to
