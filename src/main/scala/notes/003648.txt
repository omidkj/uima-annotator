He has a chronic history of diarrhea (likely some kind of
protein losing enteropathy) with persistent hypoalbuminemia.
Also he has small bowel enteroscopy which showed ersions in
stomach/duodenum with ulcerations in jejunum and a mass in the
distal bulb.  Biopsy of the mass showed extensive gastric
foveolar mucous cell metaplasia in duodenum but no evidence of
lymphoma anywhere in the GI tract.

In the ED, the patient was found to have a pulmonary embolism in
the superior branch of the right main pulmonary artery. He also
had trop elevation without significant EKG changes. He was given
325 mg Aspirin, started on a Heparin gtt and transferred to
MICU.  His vitals were stable on presentation to MICU.
