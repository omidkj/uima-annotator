Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis [**2200-11-10**]


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female that was brought to the ED tonight for
shortness of breath. The family noticed that the patient
appeared to be quite dyspnic this AM. The shortness of breath
was exacerbated by exertion. The patient has not had fever or
cough. No N/V/D. no abdominal complaints. The patient denied any
chest discomfort. The family has also noted cyanotic fingers and
toes that are new for the patient. She denies any associated
pain.

In the ED the patient had a chest x-ray that was consistent with
a significant left pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was
performed and removed 1.5L. Post procedure chest x-ray showed
improvement. The patient symptomatically improved and required
lower oxygen requirements. She was found to have a lactic
acidosis that improved after 1L of crystalloid. She was given IV
vancomycin and cefepime for empiric antimicrobial coverage.

In the ED, initial VS were: Sinus tachycardia, 108, 125/76, 29,
5L NC
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was awake and mildly
confused. Patient aware of her location and self but confused to
time. She was not in any acute distress. She reports that her
breathing is much better than when she initially presented to
the ED. Denies any current chest pain or abdominal pain. Patient
is still somewhat tachypnic but appears comfortable.

background mesothelial cells.  The immunophenotype is
non-specific. Possibilities include (but are not limited to)
lung, breast and gynecologic primary malignancies.

Portable CXR [**2200-11-10**]:
IMPRESSION: Large left pleural effusion with associated lower
lung atelectasis. Please note underlying pneumonia cannot be
excluded. Recommend followup to resolution.

Portable CXR [**2200-11-10**]:
Previous left pleural effusion has nearly resolved following
thoracentesis.  No obvious pneumothorax. Heterogeneous
opacification in the left lung could be residual atelectasis or
reexpansion edema and should be followed. Mild interstitial
abnormality and possible bronchiectasis noted in the right lung,
but nothing acute. The heart is moderately enlarged.

TTE [**2200-11-11**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely rep
