[**7-8**] Imaging:

CT abd:
bladder rupture, + active extrav.
L sacral fx to the neural foramen. B/L sup/inf pubic rami fxs.

non-displaced fx, though no definite fracture seen.
Congenital partial duplex left kidney with mild hydronephrosis
in the upper pole moiety. Tiny pneumomediastinum, of uncertain
clinical significance. L adrenal nodule which can be further
characterized by dedicated MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] adrenal protocol. Two small
hepatic hemangiomas.
Bilateral thyroid nodules. Correlate clinically with thyroid
function tests and an ultrasound can be obtained for further
evaluation on a non-urgent basis.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**2132-7-14**]
IMPRESSION:
Moderate white matter changes which could represent small vessel
ischemic
disease in the setting of underlying hypertension or diabetes.
Appearance is nonspecific, however, and differential would
include demyelinating disease, vasculitis, Lyme disease or
sarcoid.

Mild sulcal hyperintensity which could represent a small amount
of
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

No evidence for hypoxic ischemic injury.

CT Cystogram
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of bladder leak, at the site of prior rupture,
with note made of suboptimal evaluation of anterior bladder
wall. Anterolateral mural irregularity on the left likely
reflects post-surgical change.
2. Slight left sided vesical-ureteral reflux.


Brief Hospital Course:
Presented to ED, initially hemodynamically stable, with obvious
deformity to left lower extremity. She had a positive FAST exam
and became hypotensive requiring large amounts of blood products
as well as crystalloid resuscitation. She received 10 units
pRBCs in the ED, 3 units of FFP, 2 units of platelets, and
approximately 10 liters of normal saline.  In the ED, she had
remarkably bloody UOP and became hypotensive into the 50s. A
Cordis line was placed.  CT scan of the torso [**7-8**] demonstrated:
bladder rupture, + active extrav.  L sacral fx to the neural
foramen. B/L sup/inf pubic rami fxs.  Fx L5 L transverse process
Subcu air adj to the R lat 9th rib, ? non-displaced fracture,
though no definite fracture seen. Congenital partial duplex left
kidney with mild hydronephrosis in the upper pole moiety.  Tiny
pneumomediastinum, of uncertain clinical significance.  On her
imaging and trauma evaluation she was noted to have the
following injuries:
-Bladder rupture
-Left LC1/2 with bilateral upper and lower pubic rami fx, ?
extends into acetabulum
-Left sacral zone III fx
-Left lumbar TP fx
-Bilateral calcaneal fx
-Left lateral malleolus fx
-Left [**3-14**] MT head fx
-Right Schatzker II tibial plateau
The patient went to interventional radiology for her multiple
pelvic fractures and bladder rupture and had an aortogram to
evaluate for extravasation however the study was negative and no
intervention was performed.

On [**7-9**] she was taken to the OR for ex-lap, evacuation of
hematoma, repair of bladder rupture, abdomen open for delayed
closure.  She tolerated the procedure well and remained on neo
most of the day, with adequate UO.  She was taken back to the OR
on [**7-11**] for left pelvis pinning, repair of right tibial plateau,
and abdominal closure. She was returned to the Trauma ICU.

For ~ a week she was persistently febrile up to 102 F and on CXR
was found to have a left retrocardiac opacity; she was started
on Vancomycin and Zosyn. Her sedation was weaned and she was
slow to awaken; Neurology was called who recommended a repeat
Head CT which did not show any significant findings. An MRI of
the head was then performed which did not demonstrate any
obvious deficits.

On [**7-15**] she was extubated, but failed requiring re-intubation. An
IVC filter was placed and the patient was kept intubated, a
bronchial lavage was performed for continued fevers.  She was
eventually extubated and did well, she was continued on her tube
feeds in the ICU as she was unable to adequately swallow on her
own.  Her home medications were started after the patient was
identified and medical history were confirmed.

Given her continued fevers and cultures demonstrating yeast in
the urine and sputum her antibiotics were restarted.  She was on
vanc/zosyn. Fluconazole was started on [**7-18**].  On [**7-18**] she was
transferred out of the ICU to the floor.

On [**7-20**] she had respiratory distress, a code was called
requiring rapid intubation and was  returned to the ICU.  On
[**7-21**] her antibiotics were discontinued and she was successfully
extubated.  She later was transferred to the floor again. ENT
was consulted for hoarseness and concern for vocal cord injury.
it was felt he the hoarseness was due to multiple intubations
and no further interventions were recommended.

She was followed by Psychiatry and Social work for ongoing
assessment and counseling for concerns surrounding the nature of
her trauma. She initially required 1:1 sitters; there were no
observed or reported suicidal behaviors. She has not displayed
any behavioral problems and has consistently been cooperative
with her care. Her home psychiatric meds were continued.

Because of her orthopedic injuries she is non weight bearing on
both legs. Physical and Occupational have worked closely with
her teaching bed to chair transfers for which she
