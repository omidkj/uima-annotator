History of Present Illness:
 52 year-old paramedic who has a history of subglottic stenosis
and
tracheobronchomalacia who presents to [**Hospital1 190**] for evaluation for her airway disease for
possible surgical management. The patient has a history of 7
intubations for elective surgical procedures beginning in
[**2120**] with the most recent intubation in [**2125**] when the patient
underwent a VATS biopsy of her right lung for pleural
effusions with a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient
developed significant shortness of breath in [**2125-11-18**] and
pn [**2125-12-10**] was diagnosed with tracheal stenosis. The
patient had a silicone tracheal stent placed in [**2126-1-16**] by
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**State 2690**]. Patient had the stent replaced a
month later with a longer stent after which she developed
some malacia of the trachea distal to the stent.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2126-8-1**] 7:58 AM
Reason: r/o pneumo

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman s/p traceal resection, s/p tracheoplasty
HISTORY: Status post tracheoplasty. Rule out pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to postoperative film from
[**7-31**] and preoperative films from [**7-29**]:

Mild interstitial pulmonary edema has improved though lung
volumes remain quite small. Tip of the endotracheal tube is
approximately a cm beyond the carina in the right bronchus.
Consolidation of the base of the left lung is probably
atelectasis. The mandible obscures the upper mediastinum but the
cardiomediastinal silhouette reflecting mild cardiomegaly, is
unchanged. Lung apices are similarly obscured. There is no
pneumothorax seen along the more clearly delineated pleural
surfaces.
OPERATIVE REPORT
 Surgeon:  [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], [**MD Number(1) 17274**]
ASSISTANT:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Postintubation tracheal stenosis,
diffuse tracheobronchomalacia, status post tracheal resection
and reconstruction, and modified tracheoplasty.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Postintubation tracheal stenosis,
diffuse tracheobronchomalacia, status post tracheal resection
and reconstruction, and modified tracheoplasty.
PROCEDURE:  Flexible [**Name8 (MD) **].
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Assessment of airway patency.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained, Ms. [**Known lastname 69234**] was in the CSRU where she was prepped
using 1% lidocaine applied to the posterior oropharynx.
Through the oral route, we advanced a flexible bronchoscope
to the oropharynx and larynx with visualization of the vocal
cords and arytenoids which were normal. The bronchoscope was
advanced into the trachea. We could appreciate at 2 cm from
the vocal cords a circumferential area of edema and erythema
at the site of tracheal resection. There was a 2-cm vertical
incision in the posterior membranous wall with edema and
erythema with moderate malacia at this site. There was severe
mid distal tracheal malacia as well as severe right
bronchomalacia. There were minimal secretions overall.
COMPLICATIONS:  None.
IMPRESSION:  Tracheobronchomalacia and postintubation
tracheal stenosis, status post tracheal resection and
modified tracheoplasty with a moderate amount of edema and
erythema at the surgical site.

CT TRACHEA W/C & W/3D REND  [**2126-7-30**] 12:17 PM
Reason: Dynamic study, eval tracheomalacia/stenosis after stent
[**Last Name (un) **]
Contrast: [**Hospital 13288**]
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old woman with h/o recurrent PNA w/ tracheomalacia
pre-op for OR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Dynamic study, eval tracheomalacia/stenosis after stent removal.
Scheduled for OR [**7-31**]
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
REASON FOR EXAM: Stent removal, tracheal stenosis, and
tracheomalacia.
Comparison is made with prior study [**2126-7-23**].
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT through the chest without oral or IV
contrast per CT trachea protocol was performed during
inspiration, dynamic breathing and during coughing. Multiple 3D
reformatted images were also provided and reviewed.

FINDINGS: The tracheal stent has been removed. Where the
tracheal stent was, starting 2cm from the vocal cords and
extending inferiorly for 3.5cm, there is tracheal stenosis and
the tracheal wall has irregular, almost polypoid, thickening.
Below it, there is diffuse tracheal wall thickening to the level
of the aortic arch. The narrowest dimensions of the trachea at
the thoracic inlet are 10 x 6 mm (20 x 7mm when the stent was in
place). Below the stenosis, the tracheal dimensions are 14 x 16.

In dynamic sequences, there is narrowing of the trachea with
almost complete obliteration of the tracheal lumen from the
thoracic inlet to the aortic arch. More diistally, there is
moderate to severe collapse of the trachea and right mainstem
bronchus.

Widespread ground glass opacity and peribronchial infiltration
developed between [**7-23**] and [**7-24**], and is stable
since then. Scarring or atelectasis involves the right upper
lobe, and right middle lobe. Multiple calcified granulomas are
present. A small right pleural effusion is new. There is no
pneumothorax or left pleural effusion. Multiple enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes are stable measuring up to 16 mm in the
right lower paratracheal station. The LAD is mildly calcified,
otherwise, the heart and
