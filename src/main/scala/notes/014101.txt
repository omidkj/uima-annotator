Pertinent Results:
[**2186-1-30**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate to severe (3+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
POST CPB: 1. Preserved LV systolci function. 2. Bioprosthetic
valve in aortic positiion. Well seated and mechanically stable.
Trace AI. 3. No significant gradient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 76883**] was admitted one day before surgery due to being
on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. Her last dose of Coumadin
was [**1-24**] and on admission she was started on IV Heparin and
underwent usual pre-operative work-up. On [**1-30**] she was brought
to the operating room where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft x 1. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. She did however require IV
anti-hypertensives during the first several days of post-op and
was eventually transitioned to PO beta-blockers. In addition,
diuretics were started and she was diuresed towards her pre-op
weight. In the CVICU should has slight mental status changes
along with agitation which cleared by post-op day [**3-24**]. Post-op
she remained in atrial fibrillation and required a diltiazem gtt
and was started back on Coumadin. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. She was transferred to
the stepdown for on post-op day three.  Physical therapy worked
with patient during post-op course for strength and mobility. On
post-op day 2 and 3 her WBC increased to a peak of 20.5 but
trended back down on day of discharge to 9.4. There were no
signs of infection on her incision. On post-op day five she
appeared ready for discharge home with VNA services and the
appropriate medications and follow-up appointments. Her first
INR draw will be on Sunday [**2186-2-5**], with results to called to
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4129**] NP. Next draw on Tuesday [**2-7**] and then every
Monday, Wednesday and Friday in future. Her cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] will resume INR/Coumadin follow-up like he has done
pre-op.
