History of Present Illness:
73-year-old man with history of CAD s/p CABG x3 in [**2097**],
hypertension, type II diabetes c/b peripheral neuropathy and
renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3), sCHF with
ejection fraction of 30% on TTE [**2111**], and peripheral vascular
disease who presented to the ED on night of [**1-16**] with two days
of fever, cough, myalgias, vomiting and diarrhea. The patient
reports that approximately two days ago both he and his wife
acutely developed a febrile illness with nausea, diarrhea,
vomiting, and cough. He continued to feel quite unwell during
that time. He denies orthopnea but cannot sleep flat [**2-27**] spinal
stenosis, chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, LE edema, or
urinary changes. His son came to visit him yesterday and he
looked so sick he insisted he come to the ED.
.
In the emergency room, his initial vital signs were T 99.7, HR
79, BP 116/41, RR 24, satting 83% on RA (patient is not normally
on oxygen at home). He was not endorsing weight gain in the ED.
Labs were notable for white count of 8.2 with 75% neutrophils,
no bands, hematocrit of 28.8 (at recent baseline), and platelet
count of 85 (down from recent baseline in 200s). Electrolytes
showed hyponatremia of 131, bicarb of 19 with AG of 13, and
acute kidney injury with creatinine of 1.6 up from baseline
1.1-1.3. Patient underwent EKG that was reportedly without
ischemic changes. CXR showed new right upper lobe density
concerning for pneumonia. There was also comment on stable
pulmonary vascular congestion with mild edema and a small left
pleural effusion that was unchanged. He received ceftriaxone 1g
IV and levofloxacine 750 mg IV as well as ASA 325, NTG 0.3 SL,
and Tylenol 650 mg PO x1. He also received enoxaparin 75 mg SQ
for possible PE. They attempted to wean patient off
non-rebreather but could not. A fle swab was sent. Vitals at
time of admission are satting 94% NRB, RR 24, HR 67, BP 125/44.
For access he has 2-peripherals. Reportedly patient was
breathing comfortably, and he was felt to be stable for
transfer.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2115-1-21**]**

   Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2115-1-21**]):
      No respiratory viruses isolated.
      Culture screened for Adenovirus, Influenza A & B,
Parainfluenza type
      1,2 & 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus..
      Detection of viruses other than those listed above will
only be
      performed on specific request. Please call Virology at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6182**]
      within 1 week if additional testing is needed.

   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2115-1-19**]):
      Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
      Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3,
Influenza A, B,
      and RSV by immunofluorescence.
      Refer to respiratory viral culture for further
information.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2115-1-18**]**
   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2115-1-18**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.
