History of Present Illness:
PT is a 73 y.o woman with h.o diastolic HF, HTN, HL, PVD, DM,
ESRD on HD, PAF who presents after episode of CP/feeling
fatigued during her HD session today. Pt reports that she was
discharged from the hospital yesterday and was admitted for
chest discomfort+headache attributed to glaucoma. Pt reports
that her CP was midsternal/R.sided, dull ache, lasting for >1hr.
She reports an associated discomfort in the l.side of her neck.
She denies associated LH/Dizziness/diaphoresis,
nausea/vomiting/SOB, but does report feeling tired. States pain
resolved after being given "morphine" in the ED. In addtion, pt
reports no SOB/DOE, exertional CP at home. PT reports getting CP
2x/wk while lying flat in bed. Reports never exertional or while
standing/sitting up. Pt also states she experienced hypotension
during HD with BP 75.
.
Pt was taken to the ED where she was also found to be in
afib/RVR-rate to 114(not new), EKG showing ST depressions in
"v5-v6, I, II) that are reported as new but in comparison to
prior EKG are not. Pt found to be hypotensive to the 70's, given
500cc bolus and started on neosynephrine. BP up to 105 prior to
transfer. HR in 90's. L.IJ was placed for access. In addition,
pt was given 1 dose of Vanco/levo in ED for hypotension.
.
Currently, pt denies all ROS including headache/LH/Dizziness,
changes in vision, f/c, appetite/weight changes,
odynophagia/dysphagia, abdominal pain/n/v/d/c/melena/brbpr,
dysuria/hematuria, (makes urine), joint pain/skin rash,
paresthesias/weakness.

[**2163-7-13**] 09:50AM BLOOD Acetone-MODERATE

EKG [**2163-7-13**]: Atrial fibrillation. Left ventricular hypertrophy
with secondary repolarization abnormality. Cannot rule out
anteroseptal infarct - age undetermined. Inferior/lateral ST-T
changes may be due to hypertrophy and/or ischemia. Since
previous tracing of the same date, the heart rate is slower,
wide QRS eats not seen.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2163-7-13**]: There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). A mid-cavitary gradient is identified (50-55 mmHg).
There is no definite dynamic LVOT gradient present. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. The study is inadequate to exclude significant
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to the prior study dated [**2163-3-24**], no definite change is
seen.
IMPRESSION: Severe LVH with signficant intracavitary gradient.
Tachycardia/AF. No regioanl LV systolic dysfunction.

CXR [**2163-7-13**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CXR [**2163-7-14**]: Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema is new. Mild
cardiomegaly unchanged. Pleural effusion, if any, is small.
There is no appreciable atelectasis. Left internal jugular line
tip projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.


Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital course: 73 year old female with hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, hypertrophic
obstructive cardiomyopathy-like physiology secondary to left
ventricular hypertrophy, PVD, DM with ESRD on HD, paroxysmal
atrail fibrillation who presents after episode of chest pain and
hypotension during HD session on [**7-13**]. Patient transfered to the
CCU and requiring pressors to maintain her blood pressure.  She
was given fluids and was eventually weaned off of pressors.  Her
INR was elevated at 8 and she went in and out of normal sinus
rhythm, AFLutter and Afib.  She was dialysed on monday and
wednesday and was eventually brought down to a weight of 53kg
with a CVP of 5.  It was thought that this is her optimal weight
for her heart failure.  To avoid hypotension she was dialized
over the course of 4 hours instead of 3.   Pt. had a PICC line
placed while she was here which was removed before discharge.
She also underwent an EP study for ablation of atrial flutter
however no foci of flutter could be found in the right atrium
and the left atrium was not examined. No ablation occured, and
patient remained on Amiodarone.  She was given follow up
appointments with her cardiologist, primary care and she sees
renal for dialysis three days a week.


Problem [**Name (NI) **]:

# CHF: History of diastolic HF; pt with EF > 75%, severe LVH
without regional LV systolic dysfunction, no dynamic LVOT
obstruction at [**Name (NI) 5348**] but HOCM physiology when tachycardic. 4
kg taken off during HD likely resulted in hypotension, CP. No
longer required pressors after fluid bolus. Dry weight (without
prosthesis) is 53kg.
