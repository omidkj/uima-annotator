CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2147-6-25**]
IMPRESSION: Lingular pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV Dilaudid upon
admission, and then transitioned to PO Dilaudid PRN on [**2147-6-28**].
The patient remained neurologically intact and without change
from baseline during his stay. The patient remained alert and
oriented to person, location and place.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient remained hemodynamically stable. His
vitals signs were closely monitored.  He has a history of
congestive heart failure, and was noted to have basilar
crackles, and has been kept on his home doses of furosemide and
metolazone.

RESPIRATORY: The patient was maintained on his home COPD
treatments. A CXR on [**2147-6-25**] demonstrated lingular pneumonia and
he was started on a 10-day coure of azithromycin, and discharged
with this medication. He is on 4L of oxygen at home and he was
continued on this, maintaining adequate oxygenation with no
acute desaturations.

GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient was kept NPO and maintained on IV
fluids for hydration. IV zosyn was used for antibiotic coverage
until [**2147-6-28**]. The patient was transitioned to sips on [**2147-6-27**] and
advanced to a regular diet on [**2147-6-28**]; he tolerated this well. He
did not have any episodes of nausea or emesis. He was
transitioned from iv zosyn to PO cipro/flagyl on [**2147-6-28**], and was
discharged with these medications for a 2-week total course.

GENITOURINARY: The patient presented with an elevated creatinine
of 2.6 and BUN of 72.  He was given IV fluids.  A Foley catheter
was placed on [**2147-6-26**] to monitor urine output.  His creatinine
eventually trended down to 1.4.  His foley catheter was removed
on [**2147-6-28**], at which time the patient was able to successfully
void without issue. The patient's intake and output was closely
monitored.

HEME: The patient's hematocrit has been stable at around 32.
The patient has a history of DVT, and takes coumadin, but on
admission his INR was elevated (4.0; goal 2.5-3). His home
coumadin was held until the day of discharge when the INR was
2.9, at which point the coumadin was restarted. He was
instructed to follow up with his coumadin clinic as soon as
possible after discharge.

ID: The patient presented with an elevated WBC of 16.3, which
trended to 8.7 by [**2147-6-28**]. He was treated for appendicitis and
pneumonia with antibiotics as above.

ENDOCRINE: The patient has insulin-dependent diabetes. His blood
glucose was monitored with q6 fingersticks and maintained at a
satisfactory level with insulin sliding scale per protocol.

PROPHYLAXIS: The patient's anticoagulation was held secondary to
supratherapeutic INR. He was encouraged to ambulate as
tolerated. The patient also had sequential compression boot
devices in place during immobilization to promote circulation.
GI prophylaxis was sustained with omeprazole. The patient was
encouraged to utilize incentive spirometry, ambulate, and was
discharged in stable condition.
