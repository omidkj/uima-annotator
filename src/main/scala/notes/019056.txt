History of Present Illness:
From ICU Admission Note:
The patient is a 47 year old female with PMHx sig. for [**Location (un) **]
syndrome s/p colecomty and multiple small bowel resections now
with short [**Location (un) **] syndrome on TPN and multiple episodes of
line-associated bacteremia. She presented to OSH with fevers and
hypotension. Pt reports that starting Monday, she has had sweats
and chills but no fevers. On Tuesday, VNA drew blood cultures
from her line. Pt was called to the ED for positive blood cxs.
In addition to sweats and chills, pt reports a headache for 4
days, no associated neck stiffness or photophobia. Pt has a
chronic nonproductive cough, denied SOB, CP, palpitations. She
has had n/v, nonbloody, for the past 2 days. She has chronic
lower abdominal pain. No change in stool output. No dysuria,
urinary frequency.

Currently she has a 2 week old L femoral tunnelled Hickman. She
was discharged on [**2-1**] with a planned 2 week course of linezolid
for coag-neg Staph line-associated blood streem infection. The
line was changed over a wire on [**1-28**]. She had returned on [**2-9**]
with sepsis and was found to have a Klebsiella pneumoniae
line-associated infection. The line was again exchanged over a
wire on [**2-11**], and the culture tip was negative. She was
discharged on [**2-16**] with 2 week planned course of ceftriaxone.
She is followed by ID.

At [**Location (un) 16843**], temperature was reportedly up to 102.5. She
received linezolid. In the ED, initial VS were: 101 93 101/66 28
96. Pt had CT abd/pelvis to eval LLQ pain. Neg. CXR. U/A sig.
for few WBCs. Prelim report was no sig. change. Pt was started
on levophed. BCxs pending, one off Hickman, one off peripherals.
Pt also received solumedrol 125 mg IV.

CT abdomen/pelvis, [**2146-2-24**]:
1. Unchanged appearance of discitis/osteomyelitis of L4-L5.
2. No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess or small bowel
obstruction.

Chest x-ray [**2146-2-24**]:
Relatively stable examination with improved aeration at the
right lung base with persistent elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm across multiple prior studies. Stable indwelling
stents and catheter. Question of vague ill-defined densities in
the lateral aspects of both mid lung zones may be
microatelectasis. If indicated, consider CT to assess for
underlying occult nodules.

Ultrasound [**2146-2-26**]:
Focal thrombus within the right common femoral vein. Normal
compressibility and flow noted inferiorly within the superficial
femoral vein on that side. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of deep vein
thrombosis of the left lower extremity. However, evaluation was
somewhat limited by presence of a tunneled catheter.

ECHO [**2146-2-28**]:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The septal leaflet of the tricuspid
valve is mildly thickened but without discrete vegetation. There
is mild to moderate [[**11-26**]+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-2-11**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher (and
was normal on [**2145-9-23**]). The tricuspid valve morphology is
similar.

CHEST CT:
1. Segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the right
upper lobe, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe.
2. Multifocal peribronchial and mostly peripheral nodular
opacities, could be due to multifocal pneumonia or septic
emboli, should be followed.
3. Almost complete collapse and consolidation of the right lower
lobe, and
right middle lobe atelectasis, at least mostly in part due to
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions, more marked on the right.
5. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, could be reactive.
6. SVC and IVC stents with multiple thoracic and epigastric
collaterals.

ABDOMINAL U/S:
Comparison is made with prior ultrasound from [**2145-9-23**].
There is no fluid collection, hematoma, or abscess. The
intrahepatic line is seen in the expected course of the right
hepatic vein with the tip in the IVC. The CBD is enlarged but
unchanged. The limited views of the right
