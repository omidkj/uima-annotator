Chief Complaint:
chest pain

History of Present Illness:
88 yo M w/ CABG x 2, HTN, hyperchol, transferred from OSH for
intractable chest pain. He had presented to southshore for
angina on [**2198-12-8**], he was admitted and observed for 3 days, ce
were neg. His medical regimen was optimized, incld imdur 120 and
sent home. He returned to [**Location **] today, 1 day after d/c,
with similar symtpoms of chest pain which occurred at rest this
morning relieved with 1 SL NTG. He continued to have recurrent
chest pain and placed a nitro patch with no relief. He therefore
called EMS. In the OSH ED he was given IV metoprolol for a
narrow complex tach (rate 140). His ECG was notable for STD
v2-v6. Labs were significant for CK 207 CkMB 30.8 trop T 0.32.
crt 1.4. He continued to have chest pain. He was started on
heparin, integrillin, asa, plavix 300mg, bb, ntg GTT, mucomyst
600mg po, IVFs. and transferred for further care/intervention.
Reports [**3-28**] CP during transfer. His BP was equal in both arms.
On presentation to the floor, he complained of [**9-27**] CP with N/V
which improved with increase in the nitro GTT rate and morphine.
His precordial STD improved.

.
ECHO:The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral and septal walls.
There is hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 20%) No
intraventricular thrombus is seen - but apical vies are
suboptimal). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. No ventricular sesptal
defect is identified (does not exclude due to suboptimal
technical quality). The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-12-13**],
left ventricular systolic function has further deteriorated
(distal septum, lateral, and apical segments) and new right
ventricular cavity dilation and free wall dysfunction are seen.
The severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation
have increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
88M with history of CABG in [**2176**] and 3 vessel redo in [**2183**] who
presents with NSTEMI.
.
#. CAD: s/p CABGx2, presented with unstable angina and elevated
CE. CP controlled with nitro GTT and morphine IV. Noted to have
ECG changes consistent with NSTEMI. Patient was taken for
cardiac catheterization and found to have subtotal
occlusion with a 99% stenosis of left main coronary artery into
distal portion extending to the ostial LAD and LCx arteries.
Stent was placed in distal LM/ostial LCX. Patient was treated
with heparin, ACE-I, Bblocker, asa, plavix, statin, integrillin
post procedure.  He subsequently developed similar chest pain
the following day with diaphoresis relieved with nitroglycerin,
and was therefore taken to the cardiac catheterization lab for a
re-evaluation. The LCX proximal stent was
widely patent, with a 50% lesion just distal to the stent and an
80% OM1
lesion with likely thrombus. Patient underwent successful bare
metal stent placement to OM1 and PTCA of previous stent left
main/proximal LCX. Upon return to the floor patient remained
chest pain free requiring no further interventions.
.
#. Hypotension/Shock: Two days prior to expiration patient
became hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 80s that
was responsive to IV fluids. Hypotension was thought to be due
to volume depletion and patient was given 1L of NS boluses with
adequate effect. The following evening, patient again became
hypotensive with sys bp in 80s. HOwever, at this time, patient's
blood pressure did not improve with 3L total of NS boluses. He
also had minimal urine output at this time and foley was placed
to better follow his fluid balance (I/O's). Patient was
transferred to unit for initiation of pressors. Femoral line was
placed for better access and aterial line was placed for more
accurate assessment of blood pressure monitoring. Patient was
started on levophed drip with minimal improvement in blood
pressure. Patient became progressively more acidemic. This was
felt to be secondary to hypoventilation. Patient expired early
the following morning.

#. Atrial flutter with variable conduction: Patient underwent
TEE and cardioversion as patient was noted to have brief episode
of word finding difficulties. No focal deficits were noted on
neurological exam. However there was concern that patient may be
developing emboli in setting of tachyarrhythmia. Patient
underwent successful cardioversion with return to sinus after
procedure.
.
#. Dysphagia: Patient developed worsening nausea and dysphagia
to both liquids and solids. He took progressively less and less
by mouth including difficulty with PO medications. He was
evaluated by speech and swallow who felt there was no
abnormality in his swallowing mechanism. Barium swallow was
completed and no structural abnormality was noted. GI consult
was completed. They felt patient was not a candidate for EGD in
setting of anticoagulation with plavix. They recommended a soft
dysphagia diet. However patient did not improve on this diet and
nutrition consult and calorie count were completed. Patient
became dehydrated and required IV maintenance fluids.
.
# Hematuria: Patient had persistent hematuria requiring bladder
irrigation. This resolved with discontinuation of heparin.
However urine cytology was positive for malignant cells which
may have been due to metastatic disease from his prostate cancer
as PSA was elevated to 12 from prior check. Hematuria eventually
resolved with bladder irrigation.
.
#. GERD: increased protonix to [**Hospital1 **] per GI recommendations.

#. hyperchole
