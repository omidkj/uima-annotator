Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9965**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2113-11-6**]: PEG placement by Interventional Radiology
[**2113-11-15**]: Bone biopsy by Orthopedic Surgery
[**2113-11-18**]: PICC Placement

History of Present Illness:
84 y/o female with CHF (EF 20%), MR, TR, recurrent UTI and
panhypopituitarism from [**Doctor Last Name 30762**], severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], and
dementia presents with hypotension and hypoglycemia and
urosepsis.  Per family, patient is interactive and
conversational at baseline, and is able to recognize family. She
has had a slowly progressive decline over the past month. She
resides at [**Hospital3 **] memory care, and is typically
interactive, enjoys music, art, and activities. She has become
very weak, per family, since an [**9-20**] admission for CHF
exacerbation. She was admitted to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 3678**] Hospital,
where she was diuresed and discharged to rehab.  At rehab, she
started gaining weight and retaining fluid. Per daughter, her
weights were not being checked. She was re-admitted to [**Hospital 10287**] for diuresis. She was discharged to rehab about a week
ago with a urinary catheter in place.
.
On Monday [**10-16**], she became agitated per family. Over the 48
hours prior to admission, she has become more lethargic, with
decreased PO intake. Per family, she had not eaten, had food, or
medications for 2-3 days. Per family, patient typically gets
agitated and confused like such with prior UTIs, although
typically it gets caught and treated earlier.  Per rehab notes,
she was started empirically on cefpodoxine for presumed UTI,
although it does not appear patient has received it due to
inability to take PO.  On the day of admission, her providers
found her to be found to have BG 38 and SBPs in 60s. She was
given a half amp of D50, 500 cc of NS, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

.
In the ED patient was unable to follow commands or answer
questions. Initial VS were: 98.4 85 117/60 62 100% 2L. Labs were
notable for WBC of 12.6, (Diff - N 57, Band 0, L 29, M 13*).
Initial lactate was 11.4 (spurious), K was 7.1 and fasting
glucose was 50. Repeat lactate was 2.2 and K was 4.9. U/A showed
RBCs of 27* and WBCs of >182* w/ many bacteria.  Her EKG showed
NSR, LAD, QTC 453 and LBBB (no old for comparison). CXR showed
pleural effusion on left side though underlying consolidation
could not be excluded. She was given hydrocort 100 mg IV x 1, IV
Vanc and Cefepime, 1 liter NS, D10 @ 150cc/hr and calcium
gluconate for hemolyzed hyperkalemia. Urine and blood cultures
were sent. Per family, patient's code status is DNR, but okay
for intubation.
.
In the MICU, urine was found to be growing E.coli, and is
currently on cefepime through PICC line.  CT head showed concern
for ischemic changes.  MRI was obtained and showed chronic
ischemic changes, possibly from frequent hypotension.  Mental
status improved over ICU course, and patient is more conversant
than on admission.  Code status was addressed, and she is
DNR/DNI.  NG tube was placed to start tube feeds.  Patient was
given intermittent Lasix to keep her even to -500 cc per day.
.
On the floor, patient is minimally arousable.  There are no
reported complaints.
