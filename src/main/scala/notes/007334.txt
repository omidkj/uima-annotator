HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old
with a history of diastolic heart failure, hypertension and
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of refractory anemia with
[**Last Name (un) 43256**] cytoblast type who presented initially to [**Hospital3 1280**]
Hospital on [**2122-7-19**] with several days of abdominal pain,
diarrhea, poor oral intake, nausea, vomiting.  This occurred
in the setting of two months of progressive shortness of
breath with several admissions to [**Hospital 47**] Hospital
presumably for congestive heart failure and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  Upon his most recent
presentation on [**2122-7-19**] the patient was found to have a
peripheral white blood cell count of 231,000, hematocrit of
32% and platelets 542,000.  He was mildly short of breath and
otherwise hemodynamically stable.  Peripheral smear showed
that the white blood cell differential consisted of 30%
promyelocytes and 40% blasts.  He was evaluated by his
outpatient hematologist/oncologist doctor at that time and
was felt to be a candidate for leukophoresis.  A right IJ
catheter was placed.  He underwent one episode of
leukophoresis but subsequently he transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further treatment including
possible salvage chemotherapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diastolic heart failure.
4.  Asthma/COPD.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy
8.  Myelodysplastic syndrome Type 1 with [**Last Name (un) 43256**] cyteroblast
    12 to 15 myeloblasts.

Initially seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43257**] in [**2122-1-13**], anemia treated
initially with Epogen, subsequently started on GMCSF later
Thalidomide.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 346**] heart rate 86, blood pressure 90/46,
respiratory rate 24.  FIO2 96% on two liters nasal cannula.
General:  Elderly male in mild respiratory distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat normocephalic, atraumatic.
Mucous membranes are dry.  Telangiectasia on lip, no gingival
bleeding.  Neck:  Jugular venous distention at 8 cm, no
thyromegaly. Heart:  Distant heart sounds, soft 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur in left upper sternal border.  Lungs:
Crackles at left greater than right basis.  Scattered
rhonchi.  Abdomen:  Liver span of 12 cm at midclavicular
line.  Spleen is 6 cm low costal margin.  Tender to
palpation.  There are no nodes or other masses palpated.
Hypoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities showed 1 to 2+ lower
extremity edema, left greater than right.

LABS:  At the time of transfer white blood count 187,500,
hematocrit 28%  White blood count 240,000.  Prothrombin time
15.7, PTT 42.0.  Bicarbonate 21.  BUN 28, creatinine 1.2.
Glucose 110.  Urinalysis 10.8.  Arterial blood gases 7.39,
37, 41 with an SGOT of 81% on room air.  7.45, 31 and 142 on
two liters nasal cannula.

Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe patchy infiltrates with
minimal edema on preliminary read.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] with preliminary
diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome with blasts crisis.  He
had mild short of breath and hypoxia which were of unclear
etiology.  There are no clinical features to suggest
pneumonia, the primary concern had been leukotactic lung
injury from elevated peripheral white blood cell count.  He
had a CT angiogram that showed by reports blood flow through
the pulmonary arteries.  He was maintained on oxygen by nasal
cannula to support his blood oxygenation.  Hematology,
Oncology was consulted to review the patient's history and
clinical findings.  There was some concern over whether this
indeed represented MDS with blast crisis verses CML with
blast crisis as he had some features supporting both of these
diagnosis.

He was continued on Allopurinol, alkalization of urine.
Treatment of tumorlysis and also treated with Hydroxyurea.
Pathology service was consulted to continue his leukophoresis
and they did so on [**7-21**] with subsequent decline in white
blood count to 88,700.  Hematology/Oncology recommended
sending peripheral blood and bone marrow for studies
including cytogenetics to assist with diagnosis and
therapeutic options.  The patient underwent second episode of
leukophoresis at [**Hospital1 69**] (third
episode overall) on the 10th with some agitation during this
procedure.

His hospital course is also complicated by profuse diarrhea,
his stool sent for C. diff toxin returning negative.  The
patient's white blood count nadir at 57,000 following
leukophoresis on the 10th but subsequently climbed to 162,000
by [**7-23**].  The patient started leukophoresis at [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2122-7-23**] and bone marrow
results were pending when discussions were held with the
family over goals of care and treatment options.  The patient
had increasing agitation and deterioration of mental status
as well as increasing labored breathing throughout the day.
Additional workup for encephalopathy and diarrhea was
entertained.  However, upon further discussions with the
family (as patient's mental status changes prevented him from
understanding/expressing his decisions about medical care)
the patient's family and Intensive Care Unit/Hem/Onc teams
decided that given poor prognosis and clinical circumstances
the patient's goals would be more consistent with signs of
further leukophoresis and further workup of medical condition
were discontinued and the patient received 1 mg of Morphine
for discomfort.

He subsequently expired at 3:45 PM.  Multiple family members
were present at the patient's bedside.  The patient's wife
declined a post mortem examination.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory failure secondary to acute
leukemia.

DATE OF DEATH:  [**2122-7-23**].

TIME OF DEATH:  3:45 PM.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Respiratory failure.
2.  Blasts crisis.
3.  MDS verses CML.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
6.  Profuse diarrhea of unclear etiology.
7.  Leukotactic lung injury.
