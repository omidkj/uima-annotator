CC: Shortness of breath/Anasarca/acute renal failure

PICC line

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 17028**] is a 38 year old man with poorly controlled type 1
diabetes (c/b nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy),
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, question of coronary artery
disease and prior polysubstance abuse, presenting from [**Hospital **]
clinic for dyspnea and weight gain, being transferred from the
floor for hypercapnea and somnolence.
.
Briefly, patient has been residing at [**Hospital1 **] for treatment of
osteomyelitis. He was seen at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 2793**] clinic earlier on the
day of admission for worsening weight gain, renal failure and
shortness of breath. He was found to have increased creatinine
from baseline and was sent to ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially:  98% RA, 63, 12, 141/88.
Patient was admitted to the medical service where he was noted
to be very somnolent and witnessed to have acute desaturation
event to 70's on supplemental oxygen. Episode is described by
team as "excessive sleepiness" at time of interview, where he
was falling asleep in mid sentence while aswering questions.
Patient had no complaints at the time of desaturation, no
convulsions or apneic episodes were witnessed.
.
Given concern for hypercapnea and somnolence, patient had
arterial blood gas which revealed pH 7.42 pCO2 58 pO2 177.
Overall assessment is that he needed BiPAP for apneic episodes
while remainder of workup was performed.
.
Review of [**Hospital1 **] progress notes reveals patient completed 8
weeks of Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin on [**2114-12-17**] for R toe
osetomyelitis. He is now on suppression dose doxycycline. He
developed anasarca and was treated with escalating doses of
diuretics including 120mg PO Lasix + Metolazone resulting in
worsening renal function.

CXR: [**1-4**]
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
.
ECHO [**2115-1-7**]:
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Biatrial enlargement.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-5-14**],
the findings are similar.
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND [**2115-1-5**]:

Brief Hospital Course:
38 year old man with poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension,
chronic renal failure, presenting with worsening edema/anasarca,
shortness of breath, found to be in acute renal failure and
severe somnolence on arrival.
.
#  ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient was admitted to the medical
service where he was noted to be very somnolent and witnessed to
have acute desaturation event to 70's on supplemental oxygen.
The episode was described by team as "excessive sleepiness" at
time of interview, where he was falling asleep in mid sentence
while aswering questions. Patient had no complaints at the time
of desaturation, no convulsions or apneic episodes were
witnessed. Given concern for hypercapnea and somnolence, patient
had arterial blood gas which revealed pH 7.42 pCO2 58 pO2 177.
Overall assessment involved BiPAP for apneic episodes while
remainder of workup was performed. His medications were adjusted
with a decrease in pregabalin from 75mg TID to 25mg TID and
decrease in methadone to 100mg.  His mental status improved back
to baseline by the AM. He was continued on CPAP at night daily
