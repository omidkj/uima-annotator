Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
Left foot infection.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left foot wound debridement with forgein body removal, [**4-20**].
Bedside left foot wound debridement, [**4-21**].
PICC line placement, [**4-26**].

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old woman with a h/o CAD s/p stenting and DM2
who was admitted from podiatry clinic [**4-19**] with purulent
discharge from left foot ulcer, also with erythema of
surrounding tissue. She subsequently became hypotensive and
confused, prompting micu transfer. There she became
hemodynamically stable with minimal ivf. She was taken to the OR
for debridement of her wound and removal of hardware [**2130-4-20**].
Post-op she has had fevers but remained hemodynamically stable.
She also developed hypoxia, requiring up to 6L NC, which has
improved with diuresis. She has been confused, espcially when
her fever is high, but not aggitated. She has been treated with
cipro/vanco/flagyl and has strep virdans from her hardware but
other cultures negative to date. She had a repeat debridement at
the bedside [**4-21**] for an area of loculation with purulent
discharge. Currently she is complaining of pain from neuropathy
which is long standing for her.

CXR (PA/Lat) [**4-19**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Left foot xray [**4-19**]:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from [**2130-1-4**].
Since the previous study, there has been migration of several
screws
consistent with loosening. There is significant backing out of
the distal
most screw within the talonavicular joint. The screw is no
longer flush with the side plate and has migrated more medially
by 1.7 cm. There is prominent soft tissue swelling within the
medial aspect of the foot. There has also been some backing out
of the more proximal screws within the navicular. No acute
fractures are identified. There is some gas within the adjacent
soft tissues. There is prominent dorsal soft tissue swelling as
well. There are extensive neuropathic changes of the mid foot
with inferior tilting of the talus.

Pathology [**4-20**]: Medial cuneiform, left: Bone with necrosis and
focal acute inflammation.

TTE [**2130-4-21**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the mid- and distal lateral walls (LCx territory). The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. No significant valvular disease. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.

CXR (port) [**2130-4-21**]: CHF with an element of pulmonary edema.
Patchy opacity at left base likely relates to this, but an early
infiltrate would be difficult to exclude.

CXR (port) [**2130-4-24**]: Pulmonary edema has cleared. Residual
opacification at the left lung base is mild and may represent
persistent edema. Followup is needed to exclude developing
pneumonia. Heart size normal. No appreciable pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/Plan: 59 y.o. woman with HTN, HL, CAD, DM,
hypothyroidism with left foot infection.

1) Left foot infection: This was noted on arrival at her
podiatrist, Dr.[**Name (NI) 18870**] office on [**4-19**]. He noted purulence
from an ulcer so admitted her for debridement. She was
transferred to the ICU oovernight after she became hypotensive
and confused. The following day she went to the OR for wound
debridement, bone and screw removal. She was treated initially
with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl, but the cipro was
changed to zosyn on transfer to the micu. She was febrile during
this time as well with an elevated white blood cell count. The
following day, [**4-21**], she was noted by podiatry to have continued
purulent discharge requiring bedside debr
