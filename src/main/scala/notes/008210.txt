History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 49 year-old woman who was recently diagnosed with
aplastic anemia. She notes increasing fatigue. She is being
admitted to consider treatment.  She was in her usual state of
health until about last [**10/2126**] when she experience viral
syndrome and associated w/ sore throat.  She was put on multiple
courses of antibiotics (amoxicillin, Cipro, etc) for total of
[**5-25**] month. She was feeling generally well with her baseline
amount of energy until [**5-/2127**] when she
noted increasing fatigue and was noted to be pancytopenic. She
reported easy nose bleeds and gum bleeding at that time. She was
seen at [**Hospital6 16029**] for evaluation. A bone marrow
biopsy on [**2127-6-26**] revealed a hypocellular bone marrow with 5-10
% cellularity and no evidence of leukemia or other marrow
infiltration.  EBV IgM was positive at that time with a low
titer of IgG.  A repeat bone marrow evaluation on [**7-29**] showed
mildly hypocellular marrow with approximate cellularity of 30%
and erythroid dominance. She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] -  Upon
discharge, her counts remained stable and her ANC has ranged
from
300-500, platelets from 14-21,000, and hematocrit from 23.8-27.4
without transfusion support.  She remains profoundly fatigued.
She is not eating well and is drinking less than a liter of
fluid per day.  She states that she becomes dyspneic with
minimal exertion and has been experiencing chest pain with this
dyspnea.  She notes nausea and dry heaves on a daily basis.  She
occasionally has headaches but denies focal neurologic deficits.
 She feels cold, but denies fevers or rigors.  She previously
had diarrhea, but now notes her stools are firmer and less
frequent (approximately once daily).  She
notes occasional nose bleeds.

Past Medical History:
1. HCV: She has received interferon and Ribavirin in the past,
though has not received any treatment for at least 1-2 years.
Her most recent HCV PCR was 12,600,000 copies on [**2127-7-16**].

2. Pancytopenia as noted above.


Social History:
She is married and lives with her husband outside of
[**Name (NI) 5583**].  She has no children.  She is currently on
disability. Denies alcohol, tobacco or drug use.  Quit tobacco
in [**2115**].  Quit IVDU in the early 80s.  Of noet the patient is a
Jehovah's witness

Family History:
Mother had ovarian cancer at age 65 and is alive and well.

well, though has ankylosis spondylitis.

SPIROMETRY
Within Normal Limits
.
ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60%) There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
CT CHEST NON-CONTRAST
1.  No CT evidence of thymoma.
2.  Scattered peribronchiolar nodular opacities and ground-glass
attenuation, most likely due to an acute infectious etiology.
3.  Mild centrilobular emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo female with a history of hepatitis C who presented with
pancytopenia and was diagnosed with MDS.

.
#Pancytopenia, diagnosed as AML:  Throughout her hospital stay,
the pt had profound pancytopenia and required intermittent
transfusion support of red cells and platelets.  Parvovirus B19
and Herpes virus 6 were both negative.  Pt was negative for PNH.
 Antiplatelet antibody was positive while antigranulocyte
antibody was negative.  Bone marrow biopsy was performed on [**8-14**]
and was interpreted as myelodysplastic syndrome evolving to an
acute erythroid leukemia.  Pt was briefly on Epogen 40,000 units
per week, which was discontinued after the results of the bone
marrow biopsy were finalized. The patient had multiple
subsequent bone marrow biopsies which showed definate evolution
to AML.  There was concern that her Hepatitis C virus was
contributing to the marrow suppression; Hepatology was consulted
and felt this was not the case. The did recommend started
Ursodiol at the time of chemotherapy. She received 7+3
chemotherapy in preparation for an alloSCT with her brother as
the donor. Her transplant preparation was also repeated: lab
tests, in
