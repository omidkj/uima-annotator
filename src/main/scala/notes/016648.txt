History of Present Illness:
61 year old female with medical history of DM2, s/p left
nephrectomy, hypertension, CAD s/p NSTEMI presented to
[**Hospital3 15174**] with ~12 hours of word finding
difficulties and 2 falls.  She relates that she has been eating
normally.  She has been drinking normally and not having
diarrhea or increased urination.  She has had no fevers, chills,
sweats. She has been taking a stable dose of lasix. She has
noted a slightly darker urine than normal but nothing
particularly unique. Her son called EMS due to concerns for
difficulty speaking and because of the falls. She had no LOC but
did hit her head.  She was noted to be hypoglycemic in their ER
with FS in the 40s. Her initial exam sign notable for AF, tachy
in 90s-100s, but bp was stable.  Labs with new ARF BUN/CR 47/4.2
(Baseline Cr 1.3 in [**2-23**]), K 5.4, WBC, CEs, Calcium normal. Utox
pos opiates and tricyclics as are prescribed these for chronic
cervicalgia. Per report a CT head negative, CXR negative, CT A/P
to r/o obstructive nephropathy without hydro/obstruction. She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given concern for needing urgent
dialysis.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.7 P 102 BP 120/80 R 16 O2 sat
97%RA. She had recurrent hypoglycemia with drops to 45 twice
with response to dextrose pushes.  She received  2L of NS, and
started on D10W gtt prior to transfer to the ICU.

On arrival to the MICU, she is breathing comfortably.  She is
speaking in full sentences without appreciable difficulty.  She
states that her main current symptom is headache which she
relates to not having her fentanyl pops.  Her fingerstick blood
sugar is 55 on arrival to the ICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 61 year old woman with history of DM2, HTN, s/p
left nephrectomy, who presented with altered mental status,
falls, and word-finding difficulties in the setting of acute
renal failure and hypoglycemic.
.
# Hypoglycemia:  The patient presented with ARF in the setting
of glimiperide use.  Even though glimepiride is hepatically
metabolized, the metabolites are renally cleared (~60%) so it
seems most likely that her recent acute renal failure
precipitated impaired clearance of her sulfonylurea leading to
hypoglycemia.  The patient's glimiperide was stopped, and she
was restarted on Metformin 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] prior to discharge.  The
patient's glucose remained between 100 and 200 for the remainder
of her hospital course.  The patient will follow up with her PCP
regarding this issue, and she should continue to avoid
Glimiperide in the future.
.
# Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 4.1 on
admission, which is increased from her baseline of 1.0.  Her
urine volume and electrolytes were most consistent with
pre-renal etiology.  Her creatinine decreased from 4.1 to 1.3
with IVFs.  Nephrology recommended holding her home dose of
Lasix and initially holding her Lisinopril.  Her Lisinopril was
restarted prior to discharge, and it is recommended that she
continue to hold her Lasix until her follow up appointment with
her PCP.
.
# Word-finding/falls: The patient was found to have word-finding
difficulties and multiple falls prior to admission.  Neurology
was consulted, and it was thought that the patient's AMS was
most likely [**1-19**] metabolic encephalopathy (hypoglycemia,
supra-therapeutic tri-cyclic levels, acute renal failure,
multiple opiates).  These metabolic abnormalities were corrected
during this hospitalization, and her mental status improved to
her baseline.
.
# Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia without evidence of
acute or chronic blood loss.  Iron studies were checked on this
admission, which were consistent with anemia of chronic disease
