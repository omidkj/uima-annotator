Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound:
There is occlusive thrombosis of the left common femoral vein
and femoral vein. The popliteal vein is patent. The proximal
extent of the thrombus cannot be well assessed in this
ultrasound examination due to body habitus, but the thrombus
certainly extends at least into the distal external iliac vein.
On the right side, there is normal compressibility of the common
femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, and popliteal veins.
.
There is no evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity.
.

Head CT [**7-6**]:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Limited study due to motion.
Status post transsphenoidal surgery, with soft tissue in the
region of the sella and sphenoid sinus, not grossly changed
since the most recent enhanced MRI; if warranted, targeted MRI
could provide further information.
.
CXR [**7-7**]:
Lungs are very much lower today than on [**7-2**] with discrete
consolidation at the left lung base that could represent
atelectasis due to aspiration or early pneumonia. Mild
interstitial edema is also new. Cardiac silhouette is partially
obscured by the elevated diaphragm, probably top normal size.
Thoracic aorta is tortuous and mildly enlarged throughout but
unchanged in appearance since [**2135-7-12**]. No pneumothorax.
.
CT Head [**7-7**]:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect
.
TTE [**7-8**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 85 year old female with history of craniopharyngioma s/p
XRT with resultant hypopituitarism presenting with left lower
extremity swelling found to have large DVT.
.
1. DVT: Patient was started on heparin gtt and coumadin.  Given
her renal insufficiency she was not felt to be a good Lovenox
candidate.  Patient does not have history of falls, but does use
walker for ambulation. Unclear precipitant for DVT--no recent
travel or immobility, however, patient not up to date on
mammogram or colonoscopy.  Also known
malignancy/craniopharyngioma resection in [**2127**], ? recurrence,
not evident on head CT.  Can continue malignancy workup as
outpatient.  During the hospitalization her PTT was very hard to
control on heparin.  It was decided to switch her to lovenox for
bridging which was renally dosed.  She was continued on coumadin
and lovenox was discontinued when her INR was therapeutic (>2).
Her INR then became supratherapeutic to 7.6 and her coumadin was
held. There was no sign of bleeding with stable hct so she was
not reversed. It was felt that her elevated INR was in setting
of concurrent antibiotics and poor nutritional status.  Her INR
will need to be checked regularly and coumadin can be restarted
when her INR is <3.
.
2. Panhypopituitarism: Patient was continued levothyroxine for
hypothyroidism and prednisone for adrenal insufficiency.  She
was briefly on stress-dose steroids in the ICU due to transient
[**Year (4 digits) **].  This was changed back to her outpatient dose of PO
prednisone and she remained stable.
.
3. [**Year (4 digits) **]: Patient developed altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on
the floor with SBP 70s-90s. She was transferred to the MICU for
closer monitoring. While in the MICU her blood pressure rapidly
improved with IVF resusitation. She did not require pressors and
an infectious work-up was pursued. Blood and urine cultures were
negative. C. diff was negative x2. CXR revealed ? LLL
consolidation on chest x-ray and mild pulmoary edema. She was
given zosyn and vancomycin for presumed aspiration PNA and
completed a 10 day course of these.  Her BP normalized and
remained stable.  She was given stress-dose steroids while in
the ICU which were changed back to PO prednisone on the floor.
Her BP remained stable thereafter.
.
4. Altered mental status: The day following admission the
patient became agitated, refusing her heparin gtt. The following
day she c/o frontal headache, chills, and had an episode of
nausea and vomiting. She was afebrile at that time, but BP was
180/100. She was delirious and only oriented x1 which was a
change from earlier that morning. Her heparin was held (PTT had
been supratherapeutic numerous times the day prior) and she was
ordered for a stat head CT to r/o subdural which was negative.
She was agitated prior to the CT, and so received haldol 1 mg IV
and zyprexa 5 mg po. Her CT did not show an acute bleed so her
heparin was restarted. Overnight she was "arousable to sternal
rub for short pe
