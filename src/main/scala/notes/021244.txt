Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year-old
female with hypertension and former smoker with no prior
known cardiac disease who was in her usual state of health
until the evening of [**2108-8-7**] when she was washing
dishes.  She experienced the sudden onset of left chest, jaw
and arm pain, 9 out of 10 lasting 20 to 30 minutes, gradually
decreasing to 5 out of 10 and was not associated with any
shortness of breath.  No nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
The patient presented to [**Hospital 47**] Hospital in 5 out of 10
pain mostly in her arm at that point.  Vital signs at that
time showed a pulse of 70, blood pressure 205/100.  She was
sating 96% on room air.  Her electrocardiogram showed normal
sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute with [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations
in 2, 3 and F and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in V5 and V6.  The
patient was treated with aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin,
beta blockers, started on heparin and Integrilin drips and
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
catheterization.  Catheterization showed right dominant
circulation with a 20% left main lesion osteal and distal and
mid left anterior descending coronary artery with
intramyocardial, but without significant disease.  Left
circumflex with a 50 to 60% osteal lesion at the obtuse
marginal and right coronary artery small diffuse disease with
50 to 60% narrowing.  There was no intervention as the
patient had revascularized by the time she arrived at the
catheterization laboratory.

Hemodynamics and left ventriculogram showed the patient had a
left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% with mild inferior
focal hyperkinesis and 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for palpitations.  The patient
had recently completed a Holter monitor study, but denied
lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol, Dyazide, Zantac,
Levoxyl, ASA and Ativan.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for palpitations,
hypertension, hypothyroid, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, left lung cancer status post left lobectomy in1993.
No radiation.  No chemotherapy.  Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy.  Status post appendectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for a fifty eight pack year
tobacco history.  The patient quit smoking nine years ago.
No alcohol use.  No intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, but no history
of coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation to the Coronary Care
Unit the patient had a pulse of 53, blood pressure 153/80.
She is breathing at 16 and sating 98% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  Her neck no appreciable bruits and no jugulovenous
distention was appreciated.  Chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally, anteriorly and laterally with decreased breath
sounds at the left base.  Cardiovascular examination regular
rate with a normal S1 and S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the
apex.  Abdomen was benign.  Extremities her right groin site
had a hematoma that was about 2 by 3 inches in diameter.  No
bruit.  Left groin site showed no oozing, no hematoma and she
had palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  From the outside hospital showed a white blood
cell count of 7.7 with no left shift, hematocrit 39.8.  BUN
and creatinine were 36 and 1.6 respectively.  It is not clear
whether this reflects the patient's baseline creatinine or
not.  The patient's INR was .97 and her PTT was 27.9.  Her
first set of enzymes done at the outside hospital had a CK of
104, troponin of .37.  Precatheterization ECG was discussed
in the history of present illness.  Post catheterization ECG
showed complete resolution of ST segment abnormalities sinus
rhythm at 60 beats per minute.  Catheterization report was as
discussed in the history of present illness.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short this is an 84 year-old woman with
hypertension who presented with chest, arm and jaw pain and
inferolateral ST segment elevations.  There was complete
revascularization upon catheterization and no aggressive
intervention was attempted.

1.  Cardiovascular:  Coronary artery disease, the patient was
chest pain free at the time of presentation to the Coronary
Care Unit.  Her ST segment elevations in the inferolateral
leads had all decreased back to baseline.  Her enzymes were
cycled.  Her CK peaked, which was late in the afternoon of
[**2108-8-8**] and was 265 with an MB index of 8.7 and a troponin of
23.6.  The patient was kept on Integrilin for 12 hours post
procedure and started on aspirin and Plavix life long.  The
patient was also started of Lipitor as additionally she was
started on Metoprolol 25 b.i.d. and Captopril, which were
subsequently changed over to Atenolol and Lisinopril for once
a day dosing on discharge.

Pump, the patient had normal left ventricular ejection
fraction on left ventriculogram and inferior wall
hypokinesis.  The patient was started on beta blocker and an
ace inhibitor as mentioned above.

Rhythm, the patient had no events on telemetry the first
night, however, subsequently developed short runs of narrow
complex tachycardia with rates ranging from 120 to 150.  She
also had one sustained longer run of narrow complex
tachycardia that was evaluated and felt to be MAT.  The
patient was started on oral Amiodarone and was receiving
loading doses at the time of discharge.

2.  Neurological:  The patient suffers from macular
degeneration and on the day after admission began to state
that she was having visual hallucinations.  The patient knew
that they were not real and found them very disturbing.  The
patient had good concentration and orientation.  Her mini
mental status examination suggested that she was not
delirious and that she had isolated visual hallucinations.
Neurology was consulted regarding these hallucinations and
felt that they were due to the [**Doctor Last Name **]-Binet syndrome and
would resolve once the patient was reoriented in her own home
environment.

3.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine dropped to 1.4 the
following day after catheterization and remained at 1.4
throughout the course of her hospitalization.  The patient
had adequate urine output and it was felt that this
creatinine number must be somewhere near the patient's
baseline.  The patient was discharged on [**2108-8-10**] from the
Coronary Care Unit.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Inferior myocardial infarction.
2.  Two vessel coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypothyroidism.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged in good
condition to follow up with her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Location (un) 3678**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Atenolol 50 mg po q day,
Lisinopril 20 mg po q day, Zantac 150 mg po b.i.d., Levoxyl
.075 micrograms po q day.  Lipitor 10 mg po q day, aspirin
325 mg po q day, Plavix 75 mg po q day, and Amiodarone 400 mg
t.i.d. times one week followed by 400 mg b.i.d. times one
week followed by 400 mg once a day for a week followed by 200
mg po q day indefinitely.
