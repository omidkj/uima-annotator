Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7729**]
Chief Complaint:
Right parotid mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2160-7-10**]: Right parotidectomy with right supra-omohyoid
modified neck dissection with nerve monitoring and right
abdominal fat grafting.
[**2160-7-13**]: Evacuation of right neck hematoma.
[**2160-7-15**]: Re-exploration of right neck with evacuation of neck
hematoma.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 year-old Caucasian male who intially presented to
clinic on [**2160-6-13**] because for the past 1-2 years he had noted a
swelling in the right pre-auricular region. He noted that the
swelling had significantly enlarged, and a CT scan was obtained.
A prior CT scan on [**2160-6-6**] revealed a 2.3 x 2.6 x 3 cm mass
within the superficial portion of the parotid tail. At that
time, there were no characteristics of malignancy. On [**2160-6-20**],
a fine-needle aspiration biospy was performed showing malignant
cells consistent with mucoepidermoid carcinoma. On [**2160-6-24**] an
MRI neck showed a T2 hypointense lesion in the right parotid
gland at the junction of the superficial and deep lobes
measuring approximately 3 x 2.7 cm-- appearance was concerning
for malignant neoplasm versus adenopathy from overlying skin
malignancy. There was no enhancement in the mastoid segment of
the facial nerve and the lesion did not appear to extend into
the stylomastoid foramen. In clinic, he denied history of
chronic skin problems or skin malignancy. He is a non-smoker and
denies alcohol use.

He presented on [**2160-7-10**] and underwent right parotidectomy with
supra-omohyoid modified neck dissection with nerve monitoring
and with right abdominal fat graft.

Past Medical History:
History of atrial fibrillation status post ablation five
years ago, depression, asthma, arthritis. Denies past surgical
history.

Social History:
He is a non-smoker and denies alcohol use. He is employed in the
real estate industry. He is married with a son.


Family History:
Significant for cancer and heart disease. Primary lung
malignancy in his immediate family.

HEENT: Normocephalic. Atraumatic. Extraocular muscles intact
with bilaterally symmetric and equally reactive pupils. Nares

distal flap edge infra-auricular region with no evidence of
erythema, infection. No hematoma or collection. No
lymphadenopathy.

CVS: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur, rub or gallop.

RESP: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, bilaterally with no
adventitious sounds. No wheezing, rhonchi or rales.

GI: soft, non-tender. Non-distended. Normoactive bowel sounds.
Right sided 3-4 cm abdominal fat graft incision is
well-approximated, healing without evidence of erythema or
infection. Steristrips in place.

EXTR: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ peripheral pulses
bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
[**2160-6-24**] MR IMAGING OF THE NECK

There is a heterogeneously-enhancing predominantly T2
hypointense lesion in the right parotid gland at the junction of
the superficial and deep lobes measuring approximately 3 x 2.7
cm. Appearance is concerning for malignant neoplasm versus
adenopathy from overlying skin malignancy. There is no
enhancement in the mastoid segment of the facial nerve and the
lesion does not appear to extend into the stylomastoid foramen.

[**2160-7-13**] CTA CHEST

There are numerous filling defects within the pulmonary arterial
vasculature, notably in the right upper pulmonary artery
extending into the segmental branches. A filling defect is also
noted in the left lingular branches and subsegmental branches of
the left lower and upper
lobes. There is flattening of the intraventricular septum and
enlargement of the right ventricle relative to the left
suggestive of right ventricular heart strain.

[**2160-7-13**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND

No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral common
femoral vein,
superficial femoral vein, and popliteal veins. The veins of the
calf bilaterally were not seen, unable to image, given
suboptimal evaluation.

[**2160-7-14**] CXR, COMPARISON: [**2160-7-12**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
intubated. The tip of the tube projects 6 cm above the carina,
the tube could be advanced by 1-2 cm.

Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis, unchanged right perihilar
lower lobe
opacity. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. The presence
of minimal
overhydration cannot be excluded.

[**2160-7-15**] CXR, COMPARISON: [**2160-7-14**].
In comparison with the study of [**7-14**], the endotracheal tube has
been
removed. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour
persists. There
appears to be some decrease in the perihilar lower lobe opacity
on the right. On the left, the hemidiaphragm is well seen with
some continued retrocardiac and infrahilar opacification that
most likely represents some atelectasis. No evidence of
pulmonary vascular congestion at this time.

[**2160-7-17**] CXR, COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to prior
radiograph from [**2160-7-15**].

FINDINGS: Left subclavian PICC with the catheter tip at the body
of the right atrium. Repositioning via retraction by 4 cm is
recommended. Otherwise, lung fields, cardiomediastinal
silhouette, hilar silhouette, and pleural surfaces remain
unchanged. There are no pleural effusions. There is no
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO/PAIN: Mr. [**Known lastname 17881**] was admitted post-op from right
parotidectomy and right neck dissection with right abdominal fat
grafting performed. His post-op pain was controlled initially
with Acetaminophen and Percocet, then he was switched to PO
Dilaudid with more adequate control achieved. Unfortunately, he
developed some hallucinations with his pain medication on HOD#8
requiring a switch to Propoxyphene, without issue. His home dose
of Citalopram 30 mg PO daily was resumed on HOD#7. His home dose
of Trazadone was held post-operatively.

CARDIOVASCULAR: He remained hemodynamically stable immediately
post-operatively. We restarted his home blood pressure
medication, Toprol XL 25 mg PO daily on POD#0. On HOD#1 a rapid
response/trigger was called in the AM given that the patient's
blood pressure was in the 70s/40s range and he complained of
being lightheaded when he attempted to stand-up or ambulate. He
denied cardiac symptoms. He was placed on telemetry monitoring,
given three 500 mL fluid boluses with adequate response (blood
pressure increased to 100s/60s). His EKG was unchanged from
[**2-/2160**], with some residual evidence of P-R interval elongation.
His beta-blocker was discontinued due to orthostatic
hypotension. The medicine team was consulted to evaluate, and
they agreed this was related to dehydration/orthostatic
hypotension.

RESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated at the end of the
operative procedure and maintained his oxygen saturations
without issue. He was encouraged to use incentive spirometry to
prevent atelectasis or PNA. We also prescribed Albuterol nebs
PRN given his mild asthma history. On HOD#2, the patient acutely
develop
