Pertinent Results:
[**2177-6-15**] Head CT:
1. Interval increase of right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage,
stable
subarachnoid and subdural hematoma.
2. Non-displaced fracture of the right frontal bone and sinus
extending into
the right orbital roof. Please refer to CT sinuses for further
detail.

[**6-15**] CT neck:
1. Moderate amount of blood within the trachea above the
endotracheal tube
balloon.
2. No obvious hematoma in the soft tissues of the neck

[**6-15**] CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL:
1. Right frontal bone fracture extends to the right orbital roof
with small
ssociated right extraconal hematoma. Fracture extends though the
right frontal
sinus involving both inner and outer tables which could result
in a CSF leak
and clinical correlation is advised.
2. Opacity in the paranasal sinuses, likely a combination of
blood and
mucosal thickening.
3. Large forehead hematoma

[**6-15**] Bilateral Knee XR:
 No fracture or dislocation; soft tissue swelling over the
knees,
but no joint effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED from [**Hospital **]
Hospital for management of his traumatic injuries.  He was
evaluated in the ED and transferred to the Trauma ICU.

Neuro: The patient sustained moderate traumatic brain injury
(see HPI for details of injuries). Neurosurgery was consulted
upon his admission to the ED and followed him during his
hospital course. He was initially placed on dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis, then transitioned to Keppra on [**6-19**] which was
discontinued on [**6-22**]. Follow-up head CTs on [**6-16**] and [**6-18**] were
stable.

Pulmonary: The patient was successfully extubated on [**6-16**].
However, he later experienced respiratory distress and required
re-intubation on [**6-18**]. As he was unable to protect his airway
during attempts at ventilator weaning, an open tracheostomy was
performed in the operating room on [**6-24**]. Following tracheostomy,
the patient was gradually weaned from the ventilator and
tolerated increasing intervals on trach mask alone, however
still required periods of mechanical ventilation. By the time of
discharge, he had been off mechanical ventilation for 4 days and
his oxygen requirements were stable. He was treated with one
week of cefepime prior to discharge for presumed pneumonia
(sputum cultures grew out enterobacter and serratia) as he had
persistent fever spikes. Despite improving pulmonary function
and normal white count he continued to spike fever. This was
decided to be a neurogenic fever by diagnosis of exclusion, but
we recommend continuing cefepime to [**2177-7-4**] to complete a 7 day
course.

Cardiovascular: Tachycardia and episodes of a-flutter were
managed with beta blockade as needed.

GI: A Dobhoff feeding NG tube was placed on [**6-18**]. Tube feeds were
started the following day. On [**6-24**] a PEG was placed and the
patient began receiving feeds through the G-tube on [**6-25**].

Renal/fluid/electrolytes: IVF was adjusted and electrolytes
repleated as necessary.

Heme: The patient required a transfusion of 2 units PRBC on [**6-19**]
for a hematocrit of 23.9 (from 26.3) and responded
appropriately, rising to a HCT of 29.7. Due to a drop in
platelet count, a HIT panel was was sent and the patient was
temporarily taken off heparin. The test was negative and heparin
was restarted. Aspirin was restarted on [**6-25**] for baseline
anticoagulation.

Endocrine: The patient has known DM. He was initially placed on
an insulin sliding scale, but did require an insulin drip from
[**6-19**] to [**6-22**], after which glycemic control was adequate to return
to a sliding scale.

ID: Vancomycin and Zosyn were started emirically for concern of
hospital acquired pneumonia after the patient went into
respiratory distress on [**6-18**].  These were stopped on [**6-22**].  On
[**6-25**],cipro was started for sputum cultures showed a sensitive
enterobacter infection. This was changed to cefepime for better
coverage on [**6-27**].

Disposition: Due to the patient's ventilator dependence, plans
were made for placement at a ventilator capable LTAC facility.
