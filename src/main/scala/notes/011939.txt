Brief Hospital Course:
81 yof here with fever, lethergy, hypoxia, hypotension,
pancytopenia.

For her hypotension, she responded to IVF that were given on
admission.  Blood cultures were sent, no growth to date.  C diff
was sent and found to be negative.
Her hypotension resolved prior to transfer to the medical [**Hospital1 **].

For her hypoxia, it was thought to be due to pneumonia and COPD.
 She was ruled out for influenza, negative by DFA.  She was
given azithromycin and then levofloxacin and responded well.
She became afebrile and hypoxia improved.  CHF played a role and
when her BP improved, we were able to diurese her with bumex.
By [**2173-2-9**], she appeared more euvolemic without edema or
crackles.  Flagyl was also added for empiric coverage of
possible aspiration.  She should continue both antibiotics until
[**2173-2-18**].

She was also found to have pancytopenia.  The etiology is
unclear.  Heparin dependent antibodies were discovered, so
heparin should be noted as an allergy.
Ultimately, we felt that it may be secondary to her infection
part of [**Last Name (un) 6319**], or a med effect.  her counts remained stable and
this should be continued to be followed as an outpatient.

For her coagulopathy, and history of anti-cardiolipin Ab, and
history of DVT, her INR not theraputic here.  Our goal is [**2-11**],
(with IVC filter: 2.5-3.5 but she had GIB in past). We titrated
up her coumadin and her INR should be followed as an outpatient.
 Her last INR was 3.6 the morning of dischage, after a dose of
warfarin 3.5mg the night prior.  Her next dose should be 2mg and
watched carefully while she is on, and then off antibiotics.

For her ms change: has history of wernicke's aphasia. On adm to
floor she was somewhat demented, although it resolved with
treatment of her pneumonia.  Prior to discharge, she has been
much more lucid and can voice complaints. Will d/w family, it
seems like she is currently at her baseline.

For her rheumatoid arthritis, we held her enbrel and continued
prednisone. There was some discussion of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim when she
presented to the ICU but she was started on steroids empirically
without the test.  Given that we want to taper her slowly
regardless of her adrenal responsiveness, it will not change
management.  She should see rheumatology in follow up.  Both
enbrel re-initiation and prednisone tapers should be done in
consultation with Rheum.

Code status: she DNR but intubation is ok if reversible cause
(like CHF.)
