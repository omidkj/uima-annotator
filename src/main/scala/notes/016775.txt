Hypotension

None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presents with 1 day of
fever, dyspnea and confusion.  The patient reports being in his
usual state of health until this AM when he began to feel weak.
He was concerned that he was becoming hypoglycemic and thus
drank some [**Location (un) 2452**] juice and checked his glucose (it was 180).
He rested and when his wife returned, he was found to be weak,
lethargic with fever and chills.  Thus she called 911.  On
arrival EMS noted the patient to be hypoxic to 89% and pale.  Of
note the patient has been treated with dicloxacillin for the
last 10 days for a LLE injury that became infected.  He
developed a rash prior to starting the antibiotics that was
located on his back, chest and arms.  The patient nor wife can
recall any change that could cause the rash but do note that the
patient does frequently have rashes that occur for no clear
reason.

The patient was brought to the ER.  Initial vitlas were t 101 BP
132/78 HR 130 RR 28 02 92% 4L.  Per report cyanotic on arrival
of EMS, 02 sat 89%.  In the ED the patient was given
levofloxacin and then found to have BP of 80s.  IV fluids were
given and the patient responded with BP.  Additionally, the
patient was given Vancomycin.  The patient and wife report that
he immediately broke out in hives and became "red". The patient
was then given solumedrol, benadryl and pepcid with improvement
in the rash.  He was placed on a NRB prior to transport

On arrival to the floor the patient is asymptomatic.  He is more
alert and currently does not feel shortness of breath.  He feels
that in the last hour he has felt significantly improved.

ROS: + nausea prior to admission, vomiting in ER with vancomycin
reaction. + constiption.  Has had upper chest/back erythematous
rash. Intermittent LE edema r>L. The patient denies any weight
change,  abdominal pain, diarrhea,  melena, hematochezia, chest
pain,  orthopnea, PND,  cough, urinary frequency, urgency,
dysuria, , gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes,
headache.

Imaging:
CT Chest w/o contrast [**2115-11-2**]:
1. Innumerable centrilobular nodules measuring up to 5 mm
throughout both
upper lungs. This is most likely infectious in etiology, and
could represent
bronchopneumonia. There is no area of confluent consolidation.
Needs F/U
after therapy.
2. Mild emphysematous changes bilaterally.
3. Mild atherosclerotic calcification.
4. Bulky appearance to the left adrenal gland, could represent
adrenal
adenoma. Adrenal protocol washout CT recommended.

Bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds [**2115-11-2**]:
No evidence of DVT of either leg.

CXR [**2115-11-1**]: no acute cardiopulmonary process

EKG: ECG:  Sinus tachycardia at 128, ST depressions in I, II,
III, aVF, V5,V6.  TWI in V4-V6 all new when compared to previous
[**2105**] (which was also tachycardic)

Microbiology:
[**2115-11-1**]: blood culture x 2 no growth to date
[**2115-11-2**]: urine culture no growth to date
[**2115-11-2**]: legionella antigen negative


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 66 year old man with DM, HTN, CAD, Hyperlipidemia who
presented with confusion, lethargy, fever, and chills concerning
for infectious etiology. He was admitted to the ICU for
transient hypotension that resolved spontaneously. Blood and
urine cultures and legionella urine antigen were all negative.
Chest X-Ray was unremarkable. Chest CT was concerning for
possible bronchopneumonia although appearance is atypical. It
did show innumerable centrilobular nodules measuring up to 5 mm
throughout both upper lungs. This is most likely infectious in
etiology.
On presentation he had a new oxygen requirement but this was
quickly weaned to room air without shortness of breath. He
became afebrile with stable BP through out his stay. He was
placed on levofloxacin for five day course for fears of
community acquired pneumonia by the ICU team ( atypical and
unlikely presentation. His blood and urine cultures are negative
to date. His confusion/lethargy resolved prior to arrival to the
emergency room.  He was noted to have elevated cardiac enzymes.
He has history of 95% LAD lesion treated with angioplasty in
[**2099**].  EKG on admission with ST depressions but in the setting
of tachycardia.  EKG changes resolved upon arrival to ICU.  CKs
have peaked and are tending down.  Troponin currently 0.25.
There was low suspicion that this represents acute plaque
rupture given lack of symptoms but could represent demand
ischemia. He was treated with aspirin, atenolol, simvastatin.
I have explained all of the above to the patient and his wife on
2 separate occasions (yesterday and today). I advised him to
remain in hospital to obtain TTE or TEE, chemical myocardial
stress test, and CT of the abdomen ( adrenal enlargement on the
CT of the chest). I explained that he probably had a " minor
heart attack" that needs further testing and cardiology
consultation. He had unexplained fever, hypotension, confusion,
pulmonary nodules, and cardiac enzymes leak. He may need TEE to
R/O cardiac source of infection. In addition, he needs stress
[**Last Name (un) **]. In regards to the abnormal chest CT (multiple pulmonary
nodules on chest CT).  No recent images for comparison. This
needs to be repeated after treatment with levofloxacin for
presumed pneumonia ( can not R/O cardiac emboli, or old fungal
infection). He is a smoker with risk of lung malignancy. He also
need CT abdomen for the adrenal enlargement seen on CT chest. He
needs outpatient cardiac and pulmonary consultations.
