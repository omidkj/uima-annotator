HPI: Patient is a 75 yo female with pmhx non-small cell lung
cancer who presents with sob after coughing/choking incident
yesterday afternoon after eating a nut. She also reports a
similar incident last week on thursday but did not have any sob,
cough after this episode unlike today. Her initial vs in the ED
were T 99.4 and O2 sat 97% on 3 liters. CXR showed RLL
infiltrate and she was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and
was given 1 g ceftriaxone and 500 mg flagyl yesterday and a dose
of 600 mg clindamycin and part of dose of levaquin this am.
During her time in the ED, she became progressively more sob and
hypoxic with sats in the 80s on room air. She was tried on 4
liters nc and sats remained in the 80s. She eventually required
the nrb and sats came up to low 90s. Given her h/o lung cancer
and worsening hypoxia, pt underwent CTA chest which was
preliminarily negative for PE when she arrived in the ICU.
During her stay in the ED, patient continued to have episodes of
nausea and vomiting and required zofran for symptomatic relief.
She also received 2.5 IV NS. P

   On admission to the ICU, vs were: T 96.2 BP 77/56 P 89 R 25
O2 sat 93% on 100% NRB. Initial abg showed pH 7.24 pCO2 54 pO2
107 HCO3 24. She appeared very sob, but denied dizziness, cp,
nausea, abd pain, melena, hematochezia. No bm in the last couple
days.

.
Past Medical History:
non-small cell lung cancer
---This 75-year-old female initially presented [**11-28**] with sob and
swelling in her left arm. On workup, she was found to have a
left upper lobe and left superior-anterior mediastinal nonsmall
cell lung cancer.  She had a biopsy of this, which was
consistent with a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the
mucinous type.  Of note, she has a history of prior thyroid
radiation back in [**2112**].  The case was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and was determined that she was not an operative candidate.
During [**Month (only) 404**] and [**2167-12-24**] she had two
cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **] and Taxol, which were complicated by acute
shortness of breath, nausea, myalgias, and neuropathy.  In
[**1-/2168**] she had a cycle of carboplatin and gemcitabine, which
was
complicated by epistaxis, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue.  She
actually required an admission for febrile neutropenia during
which she developed acute respiratory distress requiring
admission to the ICU and BIPAP.  Since that time, she has been
gradually feeling better and has undergone no further therapy at
this point.

Social History:
She lives with her husband.  She has three
children.  She smoked one cigarette a day for about 35 years.
She rarely drinks.  She used to work as a freelance writer.

Family History:
Her mother died at age 83 of senile dementia and CHF. Her father
died at age 86 of emphysema. He was a smoker and had prostate
cancer. She has a brother age 73 in good health with the
exception of diabetes and sister age 77 and a sister age 69. She
has two maternal aunts with breast cancer in her early 60s but,
otherwise, there is no family history of cancer.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam on MICU admission:
VS: Temp: 96.2 BP:77 /56 HR: 89 RR: 25 O2sat 93% on 100% NRB
GEN: tacchypneic, winded with speaking, using belly and neck
accessory muscles to breath, pleasant
HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MM dry, op without lesions
NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, jvp to
mandible, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules
RESP: diffuse rhonchi and wheezing, poor air movement at LL base
CV: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, difficult to appreciate murmur over loud
lung sounds
ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly
EXT: no c/c/e, warm, good pulses
SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice
NEURO: AAOx3. Cn II-XII intact. 5/5 strength throughout. No
sensory deficits to light touch appreciated.
RECTAL: deferred

Pertinent Results:
CXR: Right lower lobe airspace consolidation compatible with
pneumonia/aspiration.  Left lung base atelectasis and probable
small left pleural effusion.

CTA: No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolus.
Limited evaluation of subsegmental branches due to bolus timing
and airspace consolidation. Significant perihilar peribronchial
infiltrates, right greater than left, likely secondary to
aspiration or pneumonia.  Left upper lobe mass invading the
mediastinum is again identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia/aspiration pneumonia- Patient had known event of
choking after eating with resultant sob. CXR shows RLL
consolidation suggestive of aspiration pna. Patient has nl white
count 13 with 24 bands, no fever at this time. CTA negative for
PE. EKG negative for ischemic changes. BNP was mildly elevated
compared to previous.  Patient could also have some component of
fluid overload at this point after IVF in the ED but is
hypotensive. ABG suggesting patient is getting hypercarbic and
may be tiring out. She does not want to be intubated.
Persistently with increased O2 requirements, new desat o/n [**12-14**]
with ?mucous plugging.  Improved with suctioning and increased
O2.  She was given azithromycin until urine legionella was
negative.  She was treated with Unasyn.  She stabilized and was
sent to the floor.  She continued to have an oxygen requirement
for several days following transfer to the floor.  Her unasyn
was transitioned to PO augmentin for home discharge.
.
# Hypotension- Patient has RLL consolidation, white count,
bandemia suggesting she may be getting septic. Patient responded
well to 500 liter IV NS bolus on presentation to the ICU.
Patient could also be hypovolemic from vomiting in the ED
several times. Lactate is reassuring at 1.7.  Resolved the day
of admission with mild fluid resuscitation.  Cortisol 62.7.  On
the floor, she became hypertensive and her blood pressure
medication was transitioned to her home regimen.
.
# Diarrhea: pt c/o diarrhea at the end of her discharge which
she attributed to the antibiotics.  C diff cultures were sent
and were negative x 2.  She was instructed to return if her
diarrhea worsened or persisted.
.
# CAD status post CABG x2 in [**2164**]- Per ED, no EKG changes, but
no EKG sent up with patient. Patient denies cp and has other
reasons for symptoms.  TTE without new focal WMA.  ASA was
continued and her home beta blocker was started as above.
.
# Aortic valve replacement in [**2164**]- tissue valve, not
anticoagulated.
.
# Chronic back pain with sciatica- Upon admission, patient not
complaining of any pain.  Narcotics initially held for concern
of sedation, hypotension, poor respiratory status.  As improved
restarted home dose pain medications.
.
# Diastolic CHF- Patient has normal EF 55%, but history of
diastolic dysfunction. BNP 1427 (had been 1200 in [**12-29**]), not
clearly an acute change. TTE unchanged with hyperdynamic LVEF =
75%, 1+MR/TR, moderate PA systolic hypertension.  Hyperdynamic
state may indicate slightly hypovolemic despite dynamic JVD.
.
# hypothyroidism- continued on levothyroxine at home dose
.
# Hyperlipidemia: continued on statin.
.
# Code Status: DNR/DNI- confirmed with patient
.
