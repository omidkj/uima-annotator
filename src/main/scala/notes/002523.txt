ADDENDUM:  This is a STAT Discharge Summary Addendum to the
previously dictated Discharge Summary for the admission
[**2148-2-20**].

Interventional Pulmonology was unable to dilate for
tracheostomy placement at the bedside, so the patient was
taken to the operating room where her tracheostomy stoma was
dilated and a new tracheostomy tube was inserted.  During the
procedure, it was noted that the patient had a tracheal
ulceration over the posterior wall 2 cm below the tracheal
stoma.

The patient tolerated this procedure well and reported being
able to breath easier with the new tracheostomy.
