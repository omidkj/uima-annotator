Pertinent Results:
[**2116-2-28**] Intraop TEE [**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
Prebypass: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post bypass: Patient is in sinus rhythm. Biventricular systolic
function is unchanged. Trivial mitral regurgitation present.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2116-2-28**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room and underwent
coronary artery bypass graft x4 (left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein graft to diagonal, obtuse marginal and posterior
descending artery) with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time=
104 minutes. Cross Clamp time= 89 minutes. Please see operative
report for further surgical details. He tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated. He
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident.
He was weaned off pressors and Calcium channel blocker was
resumed as he has a documented intolerance to beta-blocker.
Statin/Aspirin and diuresis was also intiated. All lines and
drains were discontinued per protocol. On POD#1 he was
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. Upon further inquiry, it was deemed that beta-blocker
could be tolerated. Coreg was therefore started and advanced as
tolerated. ACE inhibitor was also resumed. Calcium channel
blocker was eventually stopped. Over several days, he continued
to make clinical improvements and was eventually cleared for
discharge to home on POD 4. Prior to discharge, follow up
appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was arranged while followup with
local PCP and cardiologist were advised.
