Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 3321**] was admitted for an elective right sided
cranitomy. He was observed for 24 hours in the ICU where his BP
was kept less than 140, he obtained a post op CT scan which was
negative for hemorrhage. Neurologically he was noted to have
dysarthria combined with some word finding difficulty. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was expecting this post operatively and we expect it to last for
4-6 weeks until all the edema subsides. He had full strenght
throughout and was orientated X3. He was transferred to the
surgical floor on his first post op day and he obtained an MRI.
On POD#2 he was ambulating with assistance and PT felt he would
benefit from short term rehab. He was tolerating a regular diet
and voiding without difficulty. Of note Mr [**Known lastname 3321**] had
baseline hyponatremia.

On Post operative day #3, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 31648**] was noted to have severe
expressive aphasia on rounds, but was sitting up in bed and
trying to communicate that he would like to get up in a chair.
Later in the afternoon we were alerted that he was more
lethargic, he was subsequently sent for a STAT head CT which
revealed a developing epidural hematoma on the side of the
craniotomy and hemorrhage in the tumor bed with midline shift
and uncal herniation. Upon returning from CT, pt. was found to
be somulent, unarrousable with dilated left pupil that was
unreactive. Pt. was intubated emergently by anesthesia and
transferred to the ICU. His labs revealed a PTT of 55. He
recieved Protamine and FFP in the ICU. Family was called and
arrived shortly there after choosing to make him CMO. Patiend
died in the ICU at aprox. 8:45pm.
