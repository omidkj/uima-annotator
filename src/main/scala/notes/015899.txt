History of Present Illness:
79 year old man with history of diabetes and hypertension who
presents with new onset seizures.  His wife found it unusual
that he picked her up from work late that day around 2 pm. When
they got home at arond 3:30pm, he was staring straight at the TV
for 10 minutes and not responding to his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] then
proceeded to go take his pills, but his wife [**Name (NI) 5369**] him because
he had already taken them this morning.  After the starring
episode his wife asked if he was okay, but he kept repeating "I
don't know."  He continued to repeat this phrase until 7 PM.  At
7 PM he began to shake his right arm.  His wife, however, was
not concerned as he had been shaking his right arm for hours on
a daily basis for past month with intact consciousness.  He then
got into bed, and she noticed that his eyes were rolled up.  She
tried to talk to him, but he did not respond for an hour.  At
8pm she called EMS  EMS arrived to find the patient extensor
posturing without note of seizure activity.  He was intubated,
causing him to vomit, and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] by 8:20pm.  On

tachycardic in 120s.  Fingerstick was 320.

RADIOLOGY
Head CT [**2-17**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Chronic infarction in the distribution of the left middle
cerebral artery
territory.
2. Chronic infarctions involving the right frontal lobe and left
cerebellum.
3. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
4. Periventricular white matter hypodensities consistent with
chronic
microvascular infarction.

Carotid U/S [**2155-2-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Hypoechoic right ICA plaque, no significant associated
stenosis, however.
2. An 80% to 99% left ICA stenosis.
3. Likely stenosis or occlusion of the left vertebral artery,
distal to the
level of interrogation as in directly indicated by a blunted
waveform

MRI/MRA [**2155-2-23**]
1) MRI reveals no acute infarction or change in the appearance
of the brain
since the previous CT scan of [**2155-2-19**].

2) MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates diminished flow in
the left
internal carotid artery, and consequently in the left middle
cerebral arterial
branches, which are supplied by this vessel. There is
atherosclerotic
narrowing of the right middle cerebral artery, before its
bifurcation and this
is the dominant vessel, which supplies right middle and both
anterior cerebral
arteries. There is also diminished flow in the left vertebral
artery and
narrowing of the basilar artery.

3) MRA of the cervical vasculature demonstrates a very
high-grade stenosis of
the left internal carotid artery and irregular narrowing of the
left vertebral
artery. Flow in the right carotid artery is difficult to
evaluate, but there
is continuous flow signal observed in this vessel.

Renal U/S [**2155-2-24**]
IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.


Brief Hospital Course:
79yoM with history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus
and s/p stroke presenting with right arm partial seizure.
During his hospitalization the following problems were
addressed:
1.  New onset seizures:  The patient was intubated on arrival to
ED for altered mental status.  Work up included lumbar puncture
with CSF 4 wbc/7 rbcs/tp 176/gluc 176. CXF cultures were
negative. CT demonstrated old strokes thought to be embolic. He
was loaded with dilantin and admitted to the ICU.  He was
extubated on [**2155-2-18**]. On [**2155-2-20**] he was transferred to the
neurology floor with seizure precautions.  Dilantin was
continued at a lower dose of 100mg tid with levels monitored. He
was started on Lipitor for high LDL and Plavix for stroke
prevention.  Carotid ultrasound showed stenosis of the left
internal carotid.  He was treated with Plavix, and will likely
need carotid stenting in the near future after resolution of the
acute issues.  Systolic blood pressure should be >120 to prevent
risk of brain ischemia.
2.  Pneumonia: CXR on admission showed evidence of an
infiltrate.   He was treated  first with Clindamycin which was
later changed to levofloxacin.  He completed a 7day course of
levofloxacin.  He received 4 days Flagyl for possible aspiration
component, but this was discontinued per ID recc's.
3.  Candidal infection:  urinarysis and blood cultures from
[**2155-2-18**] both grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**].  Additionally, the patient's sputum
was positive for yeast.  Infectious disease team was consulted
and recommended he be treated with Ambisome 250mg iv daily.  He
will continue on Ambisome until 14days after the first negative
blood culture.  Surveillance cultures were monitored as of
[**2155-2-22**]; he should continue on this until [**2155-3-8**].  He had a PICC
line placed [**2155-2-25**].  Additionally, ophthomology was consulted
and ruled out endophalmitis.  The patient will follow-up with
[**Hospital 5370**] clinic for a full slit lamp exam.
4.  Coronary artery disease:  Initial ECG showed ST depressions
in the lateral leads.  Cardiology was consulted.  The patient
ruled out by cardiac enzymes for an acute MI. He will continue
on plavix (in place of aspirin), lipitor, metoprolol, and
lisinopril for prevention of further coronary disease.  He would
likely benefit from a pharmacologic stress test after resolution
of his acute issues.
5.  Type II diabetes mellitus:  poorly controlled diabetes
represents a risk factor for both cardi
