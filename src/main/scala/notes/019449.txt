hypoxic respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
80 yo W w/ end stage frontotemporal dementia, OSA, HTN,
depression and an unprovoked PE dx in [**2-22**] on coumadin, who
developed hypoxic respiratory distress, diagnosed with new PEs
on CTA and admitted to MICU for monitoring.

Of note, pt. was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 2820**] for diagnosis of
submassive PE and dishcarged to [**Hospital1 1501**] on lovenox/coumadin.  While
at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], has done will until the morning of admission,
when patient was found to be SOB, unable to ambulate and weak
while going to the bathroom.  HR 110s and O2 sats in 70s on RA
and 84-86% on 6L.  Of note last INR was 1.3 on [**5-9**], last dose
of coumadin at 4mg.  INR was 2.4 on [**4-25**], when last checked (on
3mg at that time).  No events noted by [**Hospital1 1501**] and they are unsure
as to why INR may have decreased. No medication changes other
decr. of risperidone dose and having been started on [**4-26**] on
Carnation instant breakfast 120ml daily.

In the ED, initial VS were:  97.7F 123/83 90 20 96% NRB.  She
underwent CTA that showed a new PE in addition to the prior.
ECG was not done. Labs showed 11K, Trop < 0.01, lactate of 1.9.
UA w/ pyuria, bacteriuria, positie nitrates w/ 57 epis.  She
received 650mg of APAP, CFTX 1g, Heprain gtt was started at

contact[**Name (NI) **] at time of admission.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt. in NAD on 50% face mask. No acute
complaints.  She is unable to provide any reproducible history,
her responses are incongruent.
.
Review of systems: unable to obtain reproducibly.

CTA [**2181-5-12**]:
FINDINGS: There are curvilinear filling defects in the main
pulmonary artery extending into the right main pulmonary artery
and left main pulmonary artery. The left upper lobe artery
appears patent but just distal to the bifurcation, there appears
to be additional thrombus completely occluding one arterial
branch. There is a large thrombus within the right main
pulmonary artery extending into the right middle lobe artery and
right lower lobe artery, some of which branches appear to be
patent. There is flattening and perhaps mild bowing of the
interventricular septum and reflux of contrast into the hepatic
veins, as seen previously.

The aorta and branch vessels demonstrate calcifications but are
otherwise
unremarkable. Trace pericardial fluid is within physiologic
range and appears unchanged compared to recent prior exam.
Diffuse patchy ground-glass opacity persists and is nonspecific.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected. A 1-cm
subcarinal lymph node is again noted. No other lymphadenopathy
is detected.

The visualized portion of the thyroid appears homogeneous.

This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic
structures.  Small hiatal hernia is again noted. No acute
subdiaphragmatic process is detected. A 12-mm soft tissue
density subcutaneous nodule in the left anterior chest wall is
again noted. No concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions
are detected.

IMPRESSION: Increased clot burden within the central and
bilateral main
pulmonary arteries.
