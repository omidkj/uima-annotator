CT-ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2159-10-13**]:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the
visualized pelvis, there is bibasal atelectasis. There is no
pleural mass, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is
normal in size. There is no pericardial effusion.
In the abdomen, evaluation of solid organ system is without
contrast. The liver appears similar to prior with multiple
hypodensities, likely cysts throughout the liver. There has been
a cholecystectomy. The pancreas appears normal. The spleen
appears normal. The adrenals are normal.
There are innumerable bilateral cysts in the massively enlarged
kidneys, characteristic of adult polycystic kidney disease. In
the left kidney, there are multiple stones within the kidney
parenchyma and cenrtal collecting system that appear similar to
the previous scan. Although, there is an apparent new collection
of stones in the proximal ureter (series 301A, image 29), and
this may represent the stone seen on the outside study (series
200B, image 39). The configuration of the right kidney appears
similar to prior. Abdominal loops of bowel appear normal. There
is no abdominal free air, free fluid or pathologic
lymphadenopathy. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and
course and demonstrates atherosclerotic calcifications.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Pelvic loops of
bowel appear normal. The bladder and distal ureters appear
normal. There is no pelvic free air, free fluid or pathologic
lymphadenopathy.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no suspicious osteolytic or
osteoblastic lesion. Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in
the spine.
IMPRESSION: Overall, very similar appearance of polycystic
kidneys with one group of anterior stones now apparently in the
proximal left ureter.
.
IR-guided Percutaneous Nephrostomy [**2159-10-14**]: (Preliminary Report)
Successful placement of 8 French nephrostomy tube into the left
kidney.
.
ECG [**2159-10-14**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Delayed R wave progression. Modest ST-T wave changes. Findings
are non-specific but clinical correlation is suggested. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
ECG [**2159-10-16**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
The findings are as outlined on previous tracing of [**2159-10-14**]
except that ventricular rate is slower.
.
TTE [**2159-10-16**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There are
filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with
Lambl's excresences (normal variant). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild right ventricular dilation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension. Mild
aortic regurgitation.
