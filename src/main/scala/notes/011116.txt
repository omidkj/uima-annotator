CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post left MCA cerebrovascular
accident

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 87-year-old
male with a complicated past medical history, who presents to
and dense right-sided hemiparesis on [**2108-4-29**].  The
patient was evaluated by the stroke team, and MRI showed a
left inferior MCA cerebrovascular accident with evidence of
M2 segmental occlusion.  The patient is status post treatment
with intra-arterial TPA.  The patient was then transferred to
the Neurology Intensive Care Unit where, after TPA, he was
noted to have improvement in right extremity strength, speech
pressure was closely monitored, with a goal of systolic 140
to 160, titrating intravenous labetalol and Neo-Synephrine.
Anticoagulation with heparin drip and Coumadin, with an INR
goal of 2 to 3, and PTT goal of 40 to 60.  The  patient was
continued on vancomycin for endocarditis (MSSA) diagnosed in
[**3-17**].
The patient was then transferred, after stabilization in the
Neurology Intensive Care Unit, to the Medicine team for
further management of the patient's multiple comorbidities.
On arrival to the medical [**Hospital1 **], the patient notes positive
productive cough with mild shortness of breath.  Otherwise
denies fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, headache.

hematocrit 27.4.  Sodium 136, chloride 106, bicarbonate 23,
BUN 23, glucose 84.  On the day of transfer to Medicine
service, [**2108-5-1**], white cells 13.1, hematocrit 27.8.
Sodium 147, potassium 4.2, chloride 112, bicarbonate 20, BUN
28, creatinine 1.7, glucose 141.  PT 25.8, PTT 66.8, INR 4.6.

from [**4-30**] showed 10,000-100,000 yeast.  Chest x-ray from
[**4-30**] showed perihilar haziness, slight vascular
engorgement suggestive of pulmonary edema, persistent dense
left retrocardiac opacity, right pleural effusion, mass-like
opacity centrally in the right upper lobe.

IMPRESSION:   87-year-old male with extensive past medical
history, who presented with aphasia and right-sided
hemiparesis and found to have a left MCA cerebrovascular
accident on MRI status post intra-arterial TPA treatment and
then subsequent monitoring in the Neurology Intensive Care
Unit, who is now transferred to the Medical service for
further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Neurology:  The Neurology team continued to follow the
patient during the remainder of his hospital stay, and it was
noted that the patient was making great progress with
relation to improvement in his right hemiparesis.  The
patient was noted to still be dysarthric as well as aphasic
intermittently.  Based on recommendations by the Neurology
team, a repeat MRI and MRA were performed of the head.
Findings included no definite area of restricted diffusion
was identified.  The previously-identified subtle area of
restricted diffusion with increased signal in the left
parietal temporal lobe is no longer visible.  An old right
cerebellar infarct was visualized.  No new infarcts or
evidence for hemorrhage were noted.  No evidence of
high-grade stenosis or vascular occlusion in the arteries of
the anterior and posterior circulation of the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**].

It was the feeling of the Neurology team, based on this study
from [**2108-5-12**], some 13 days after his stroke, that the
patient's prognosis for improvement was "excellent."  The patient
continued to have difficulties handling his secretios with weak
cough. A swallow eval was ordered however was delyaed due to lack
of availability of speech/swallow satff. Finally a video
swallow was done and pt found to have aspiration of all
consistencies. neuro felt this could be due to delirium as there
were no other focal signs of cva. The speecha dn swallow service
as well as ENT consult did not feel that diffuse weakness was due
to delirium however  they were not sure what could cause
this. Repeat eval done [**5-22**] showed noimprovemend so a PEG
tube was placed.
Lastly, the patient was noted to have intermittent periods of
delirium with marked sundowning, which was treated moderately
well with Haldol as needed. He did not receive haldol for the
last 2 weeks ofstay due to concerns of sedation with increased
risk of aspiration. He improved wihtout it. He continued to have
occasional hallucinations but overall has greatlyimproved mental
status. He is alert and orineted X3 most of the time.
2. Cardiac:
a.  Ischemia:  The patient was not noted to have any chest
pain while an inpatient at [**Hospital1 188**], however, was intermittently noted to be in
respiratory distress, which was thought to be possibly
secondary to worsening congestive heart failure of possible
ischemic origin.  Electrocardiograms were obtained and showed
no ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes were cycled
intermittently and showed no elevation.  The patient was
maintained on his cardiac medications, including aspirin and
beta blocker.Isordil was added.

b.  Pump:  Patient with a history of idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy with a reported ejection fraction of 25-30% , as
well as 3+ mitral regurgitation and severe TR.  The patient's
intermittent episodes of dyspnea as well as occasional
[**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing was thought to be possibly secondary
to worsening congestive heart failure.  Chest x-rays were
obtained, however, did not show pronounced vascular
engorgement. Congestive heart failure service was consulted
and plan on [**2108-5-6**], was to have the patient
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for right heart
catheterization and subsequentadjustment of  therapy.  Swan
numbers showed that the patient had an elevated wedge as well
as pulmonary artery pressure which was attributed to the
patient's 3+ mitral regurgitation.  The patient was thought
to actually be total body fluid depleted, and was hydrated
during his stay in the Coronary Care Unit rather than
diuresed.  The patient was maintained on beta blocker and ACE
inhibitor, and the doses of both were titrated upwards based
on blood pressure tolerance.

c.  Rhythm:  Patient with a history of atrial fibrillation,
however, on transfer from the Neurology service on [**5-1**],
the patient was noted to have an INR of 4.6.  The patient's
Coumadin was
