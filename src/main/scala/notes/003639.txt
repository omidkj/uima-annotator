History of Present Illness:
76 year old woman with h/o Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], atrial

developed runny nose, fatigue, and malaise. She then noted a
cough with green sputum. She originally was afebrile, but a few
days prior to admission, developed chills and subjective fevers.
She was so weak, she was confined to her bed. At that point, her
family took her to the ED.

Lactate 4.4. Code sepsis was called and Right IJ line placed.
She was given levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, flagyl, hydrocortisone
(stress dose), and tylenol. She was then admitted to the MICU.
She was given levophed per protocol, but this was quickly weaned
off.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) pneumonia complicated by sepsis: patient was seen in the ED
and a "code sepsis" was called based on fever, tachycardia, and
a lactate of 4.4. She had a chest x ray demonstrating a right
middle lobe pneumonia. She had transient hypotension and was on
Levophed. She was admitted to the MICU and placed on ceftriaxone
and azithromycin. She had received a dose of levofloxacin in the
ED, but this was stopped due to potential reaction with
myasthenia. Her Levophed was quickly weaned off and she was
quickly hemodynamically stable. She remained on O2, but this was
also stopped after a couple of days. Her NIFs and vital
capacities were monitored to ensure no myasthenic crisis. These
remained stable. She was called out to the floor and did well.
Her d/c NIF was -22 and vital capacity was -1100. She was
discharged home and will complete a course of cefpodoxime and
azithromycin. She will follow her respiratory status as
azithromycin can also provoke a myasthenic crisis. She was also
given a dose of Pneumovax prior to her discharge. No organism
was identified as the etiology of her pneumonia.

2) myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: patient was maintained on prednisone and
Mestinon at her home doses. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and neurology followed
her initially. She did well and had no complications from her
myasthenia. She will be followed as an outpatient. She was
started on Bactrim for pneumocystis prophylaxis given her
chronic steroid use.

3) mineralocorticoid deficiency: Ms. [**Known lastname 12289**] had persistently
low blood pressures upon leaving the intensive care unit. SBP in
the 80s when sitting, improved to low 100s when lying in bed.
These were minimally responsive to fluid boluses. She also did
not appear volume depleted. Given her chronic prednisone
use(relatively glucocorticoid specific), a urine sodium was
checked. This was >80. It was thought that she had a
mineralocorticoid deficiency and was started on Florinef. Her
blood pressure appeared to rise following it use. She will be
discharged on this medication.

4) atrial fibrillation: the patient remained in atrial
fibrillation as an inpatient. She had several runs of rapid
ventricular response to 140s-150s. Initially her b blocker was
held due to low blood pressure. A smaller amount was restarted
in order to control her heart rate. This was effective and she
was discharged home on a lower dose of b blocker as well as
coumadin. INR at time of d/c was 2.
