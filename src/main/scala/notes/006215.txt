Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH with cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
trans-esophageal echocardiogram
intra-aortic balloon pump placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 71254**] is a 64 yo female who presented to an OSH with multiple
episodes of syncope. Her husband witnessed these episodes and
said she would have LOC only for a few seconds and she never had
seizure activity. At the OSH she was found to have complete
heart block. A temporary pacemaker was placed and then a perm
one was placed the next day. She then had an episode of fluid
overload, tachycardia, and hypotension. She had an ECHO done
with concern for tamponade from perf after pacemaker placement,
but her ECHO was benign. She also began to have a dropping
bicarb without a gap. She had a CT abdomen without contrast
which was suggestive of diverticulitis with R paracolic fluid.
She was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
During transfer she had an episode of pulseless VT.
.
Once at [**Hospital1 18**], she went to the cath lab and was found to have
cardiogenic shock and moderate +3 MR which was not thought to
the be cause of her shock. She had clean coronary arteries. Not
a lot of AI. High wedge and R pressure. Cardiac index 1.8. PA
gram showed no PE. An IABP was placed for support. In the cath
lab she had another episode of pulseless VT and was shocked.

Pertinent Results:
[**2182-12-7**] cath: FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Cardiogenic shock with normal coronary arteries.
2. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
3. Left ventricular dysnchrony.
4. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
5. No aortic valve insufficiency.
6. Successful placement of intra-aortic balloon pump.
.
.
[**2182-12-7**] ECHO:  Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is
elongated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.

3.The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. RV function
appears
depressed but only mildly at worse.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No evidence
of
endocarditis seen. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
.
[**2182-12-7**]: CT abd/pelvis/chest: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Ascites.
3. Diffuse mild bowel wall and gallbladder wall edema likely due
to third spacing. However, if clinical suspicion for
cholecystitis, ultrasound could be performed.
4. Endotracheal tube with its tip at the level of the carina.
Repositioning is recommended.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Tiny
liver and right renal hypodensities, too small to characterize.
.
.
[**2182-12-7**] TEE: Conclusions:
1. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
2.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no
ventricular septal defect.
4.There is severe global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular
pressure/volume overload or pacer wire.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-26**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 71254**] is a 64 year old female with history of HTN who
presented to an OSH with a viral prodrome and weakness and was
found to be in complete heart block. She  receieved a perm
pacemaker and subsequently went into cardiogenic shock for an
unknown reason.  She was intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care. She coded in transfer and again in the cath lab
before coming to the CCU.
.
# cardiac: cardiogenic shock of unknown etiology.  Upon transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**] she went to the cath lab and was found to be in
cardiogenic shock with normal coronary arteries.  A PA cath was
placed as was an IABP to help support her pressures. She was
transferred to the CCU on 3 pressors (norepi, levophed,
dopamine).  A TEE showed low LV outflow and minimal RV function.
 Given this finding, there was concern about a pulomonary
embolism.  A CT chest was performed and showed no PE.  Despite
maximum doses of pressors, her SBP continued to drop along with
her MAP.
.
# metabolic acidosis: unknown etiology. Likely ischemia
secondary to her cardiogenic shock but could also be from
ischemia secondary to sepsis.  Her lactate was originally 12.6
but continued to rise with a max of 22.4.  She was initially
placed on broad spectrum antibiotics  (vanc, cipro,
metronidazole) to cover any possible infectious causes.  A CT of
her abdomen at the OSH done without contrast showed suggestion
of abscess/diverticulitis given fluid in the paracolic gutter.
While getting a CT chest to rule out PE, a CT abdomen/pelvis was
also performed which did not show any suggestion of abscess or
infection.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent as well.
 Lyme titers were sent given her presentation of complete heart
block and have subsequently returned as negative.
.
.
Over the course of the evening, despite aggressive measures, the
patient continued to have ongoing hemodynamic collapse.  At
around 10pm on the day of admission, a family meeting took place
to discuss the goals of care and grim prognosis. THe husband and
daughter wished to change code status to DNR. This was
coaborated with the fellow Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5857**] and attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient continued to deteriorate and went into multiorgan
system failure with increasing INR, increasing creatinine, LFTs,
and DIC (low fibrinogen, low p
