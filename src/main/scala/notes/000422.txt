CXR in ED: No active lung disease.
<BR>
ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is probably
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CXR [**1-26**] (after unsuccessful SC/IJ line attempts): Cardiac
silhouette and mediastinum is within normal limits.  No
pneumothoraces are identified on either side.  No parenchymal
opacities are seen. There is no evidence for gross pulmonary
edema.

RUE US: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.

Renal Artery Cath:
1. Significant renal artery stenosis of the transplanted kidney.

2. Normal central blood pressure.
3. Successful stenting of transplant renal artery.
4. Successful Perclose Proglide closure of right femoral artery.

5. Successful Angioseal closure of left femoral artery.

Renal US:  Normal appearance of transplant kidney. No evidence
of
hydronephrosis.

V/Q Scan: Low likelihood for pulmonary embolism.

Abdominal/Pelvic CT:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal hematoma.
2. Status post left nephrectomy, with a residual soft tissue
nodule of unclear etiology.  If there is a neoplasm and any
concern for recurrence, comparison to prior studies could be
helpful if available.
3. Renal transplant in the right lower quadrant, with delayed
excretion of contrast from prior catheterization procedure.
4. Bibasilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially treated for severe hyperglycemia in
the ICU, and once stable, transferred to the [**Location (un) **] Chief
Medicine Service for further evaluation of his symptoms and
underlying medical problems. During his admission, he was noted
to have severe HTN, and received surgical intervention for his
renal artery stenosis. He was also noted to be hypoxic on finger
pulse oximetry to 85% RA, leading to a workup for causes of this
hypoxia which was most likely [**2-7**] venous/arterial mixing of
blood in his extremities due to b/l shunts and grafts. SaO2 as
measured on his ear was much improved. His creatinine levels
rose slightly after the procedure, with concern for renal
toxicity from surgical contrast. CT scan was remarkable for a
small soft tissue mass in the area of his L nephrectomy, with
concern for malignancy. Renal team recommended f/u with repeat
CT scan in three months.
<BR>
1) Hyperosmolar Nonketotic Hyperglycemia: Upon initial
presentation to the [**Name (NI) **], pt. had glucose of 837. He had been
symptomatic for hyperglycemia for past several weeks
(polydipsia, polyuria, malaise). Pt was not on medications for
DM2 prior to admission. In [**2100**], he was noted to be
hyperglycemic, but this was thought to be [**2-7**] his Prograf and
this medication was changed. Random glucose in [**Month (only) 1096**] had been
measured at 214. His hyperglycemia was likely exacerbated by his
steroid medications. Other possibilities included viral syndrome
or bacterial bronchitis, although blood and urine Cxs were
negative. There was also a possibility that the renal artery
stenosis, combined with mild dehydration, could have lead to a
pre-renal azotemia that compounded the underlying hyperglycemia.
<BR>
The pt. was aggressively hydrated in the ICU and started on an
insulin drip until glucose levels returned to baseline. He was
then transferred to the floor with a RISS and followed by the
[**Last Name (un) **] endocrine service for modifications to his sliding scale.
Prior to d/c, pt. was educated about the use of insulin and
symptoms of hyper/hypoglycemia.
<BR>
2) HTN: Pt. stated that his BP has not been well controlled for
a long time, and that the loss of his R kidney had originally
been due to HTN. He was on an extensive list of medications for
bp at home, including amlodipine, clonidine, lisinopril,
valsartan, furosomide, and metoprolol. These medications were
optimized when possible, and hydralazine and nitro prn were also
added to his regimen. Metoprolol was switched to labetalol in
consult with the renal service out of concern for a paradoxical
interaction between his beta-blocker and the alpha-agonist. It
was thought that the beta-2 agonism and alpha-1 antagonism
effects of labetalol would avoid the risk of unopposed alpha-2
vasoconstriction. When his pressures remained elevated to the
190s on thi
