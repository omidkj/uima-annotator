Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10488**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
43yo female w/ complicated surgical history, chronic pain
requiring narcotics, and severe Cdiff infection requiring
sub-total colectomy, who presents with lethargy for the last [**1-3**]
days, and one day of recurrent vomiting. She has been feeling
generally unwell for the last few weeks, with recurrent dizzy
spells, worsening of her chronic nausea, and a new rash on her
legs. The dizzy spells include tunnel vision, and sometimes
falls, and come on unexpectedly. The rash is a widespread,
palpable rash on her bilateral LEs; in dermatology, the rash was
thought to look like leukocytoclastic vasculitis, but the
pathology was not consistent. She was started on a trial of
topical clobetasol, that has partially improved the rash. She
also has angular chelitis and dry eyes. An extensive
rheumtologic work-up was negative. Two days ago she had a fever
at home, and many nights she has been having shaking chills.
[**9-23**] she had a positive strep throat swab and is being treated
with Penicillin, along with prophylactic PO vanco. Four days ago
she treated herself with fluconazole for a yeast infection.
Wednesday she went to see her PCP with similar, and had EKG with
ST wave flattening. Yesterday her lightheadedness was worse than
usual and she actually passed out. Today, feeling generally
unwell, and and had nausea and vomiting of clear fluid, called
her PCP and then came in.

In the ED, initial VS were: 99.5 76 64/42 18 95% RA. Abdomen
noted to be distended, KUB showed air-fluid level. NG tube put
out 100cc of gastric fluid and patient felt more comfortable.
Surgery doesn't feel like this is an acute surgical issue. They
recommended bowel rest. Tachycardic to 130s. Got 5L fluids. EKG
unconcerning. Treated hyperkalemia. BPs typically in the 80s.
Patient [**Month/Year (2) 28316**] 102.8, got Vanc/Zosyn. Access is 20G PIV.
Vitals prior to transfer were 137 117/72 100%RA 18.

On the floor, she is complaining of nausea and vomiting up clear
fluid. She appears chronically ill and uncomfortable. She has
been having more watery BMs than usual. She continues to have
chronic back pain. The rest of her ROS is negative.

the rectum, overall picture could represent enteritis and ileus,
however cannot exclude early or evolving obstruction. Serial
abdominal exam and KUB would be prudent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18036**] is a 43yo female w/ complicated surgical history
and previous cardiomyopathy, who presents with 3 weeks of
dizziness and rash, as well as lethargy and hypotension.

# Hypotension: Most likely hypovolemia in from vomiting and poor
PO intake, with or without sepsis from infection (unclear
source). BP has been stable after IVF resuscitation. No clear
source of infection, so holding Abx. Continuing on IVF while NPO
for bowel rest. Metoprolol held on admission, restarted at
12.5mg PO BID.  The patient had an AM cortisol sent which
returned low at 4.9.  While not diagnostic for adrenal
insufficiency, this may be the udnerlying process for the
patient's paroxysmal hypotension, nausea and vomiting.

# Malnutrition, moderate, with hypoalbuminemia and possible
vitamin deficiency: She was seen by nutrition, who recommended
supplements and multivitamins. She stated that she does take
multivitamins and refused the supplements. Her nutritional
status, including her angular cheilitis and albumin levels,
should be followed up as an outpatient.

#Sicca: Negative workup for sjogren's syndrome.  The patient had
spit pooling on physical exam, making sicca or sjorgren's highly
unlikely.  Most likely etiology is drug effect from venlafaxine
and/or amitryptiline.

# Fever: Ddx infection vs vasculitic process. The source of
infection would be very unclear. CXR clear, UA clean, no clear
infection on CT abdomen. Finishing outpatient regimen for strep
throat with PCN and Cdiff ppx with PO Vanc. Resending Cdiff and
follow
