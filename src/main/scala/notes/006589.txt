History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 89 y/o male with multiple medical
problems from [**Name (NI) **] [**Hospital **] nursing home with hx of CAD s/p
3-vessel CABG, hx CHF (EF 50-55% in [**1-5**]), HTN, COPD (on
intermittent home oxygen), hx CKD III (Baseline Cr 1.3) who
presents after being discharged from [**Hospital1 **] [**2159-11-27**] when he had
ERCP for cholecystitis with sphincterotomy and sphincteroplasty,
now p/w 2-3 days of worsening RUQ pain. +nausea today, no
vomiting. No diarrhea or subjective fever. No BM in 10 days.
.
He has significant memory problems and is somewhat of a poor
historian, but he states the pain comes on abruptly and then
gradually decreases. He does not know what precipitated his pain
and he does not know if anything makes it better. He was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] several weeks ago for cholecystitis at which
time he had ERCP with removal of sludge and small stones. He
does not remember when he had his most recent bowel movement or
whether eating affects his pain.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 5, 98.5, 66, 113/45, 16, 95% RA.
Labs notable for WBC 16.1, ALT 17, AST 18, AP 100, lipase 24,
Tbili 1.1, albumin 3.7, lactate 1.0. Bcx pending. CT abd/pelvis
showing, "dilated GB with pericholecystic stranding and gb wall
thickening concerning for acute cholecystitis. Air in GB likely
secondary to recent ERCP. Urinary bladder wall thickening and
enhancement concerning for cystitis. Unchanged right inguinal
bowel containing hernia and appendix containing right spigelian
hernia." Surgery was called: likely needs perc chole tube, they
will call IR.
.
Pt is being admitted for acute cholecystitis. IR was paged. Pt
given IV unasyn and 500 cc IVF prior to transfer. In the MICU,
they did percutaneous cholecystostomy in IR, with improvement in
his pain, but still mildly tender. Cefepime was added given
concern for UTI and resistant E. coli in the past. He was
continued on Flagyl for anaerobic coverage. He was given IVF's,
and is now +2L for LOS.

Studies:

[**12-12**] ECG's: Sinus tachycardia. The tracing is marred by
baseline artifact. There is frequent ventricular ectopy. Right
bundle-branch block persists. Repeat tracing of diagnostic
quality is suggested.

Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Non-specific inferior
ST-T wave
flattening. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-11-22**]
ventricular ectopy is no longer recorded. The rate has slowed.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim
change.

[**12-12**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Findings concerning for acute cholecystitis.
2. Findings concerning for UTI/cystitis.
3. Extensive diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
4. Right Spigelian hernia containing the appendix and small
bowel containing
right inguinal hernia, no associated bowel obstruction.

[**12-12**] Gallbladder Drainage:
IMPRESSION:
Uncomplicated placement of percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter
(8 French
[**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter) via a right subcostal transhepatic approach.
Specimen sent for microbiology analysis.

[**12-13**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Persistent left basilar scarring. No
acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**12-13**] Abdominal Xray: IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or
ileus.
