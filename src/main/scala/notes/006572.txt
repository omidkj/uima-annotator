History of Present Illness:
87 year-old M with CHF and HTN who presents with hypotension
into 90s/40s. He underwent massive L inguinal hernia repair [**5-26**]
at OSH, referred to [**Location (un) **] by VNA this am for hypotension into
90s/40s. He vomited twice overnight and presented with weankess
to OSH ED today. He reports dizziness with movement and nausea;

transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In ED he was given levoflox and
metronidazole to cover GI and urinary pathology. He was given
750cc bolus with resultant SBP 90s. General surgery evaluated
the patient and recommended scrotal elevation for swelling, but

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2184-5-27**] 7:37 PM
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.

2. Retrocardiac opacity which could be the combination of
pleural effusion and atelectases, however, cannot rule out
consolidation.

3. Left-sided dual chamber pacemaker.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2184-5-27**]  6:37:22 PM
Ventricularly paced rhythm at 60 beats per minute with probable
underlying
atrial fibrillation. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT  [**2184-5-28**] 3:39 PM

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2184-5-31**] 4:01 PM
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL  [**2184-5-31**] 4:01 PM
1. Coarse echotexture of the liver, which may represent a
component of fatty infiltration, although underlying
cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded.
2. Patent Vascularity within the liver- specifically, patent
hepatic veins, portal veins and hepatic artery.
3. Moderate amount of ascites in the right upper and right lower
quadrants.
4. 4-cm seroma underlying the incision site. No significant
ascites seen within the left lower quadrant.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2184-5-31**]
Biventricular cavity enlargement with severe systolic
dysfunction
c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Moderate-severe
aortic valve stenosis. Moderate to severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. At least moderate mitral regurgitaiton.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old M with CHF and HTN who presents with post-operative
hypotension, now stable, with serosanguinous discharge from
abdominal surgical incision site.
.
* Post-Operative Wound Hemorage:
Pt with new onset bleeding from surgical site. Concerning for
new hematoma after he worked with PT vs worsening ascites either
from hepatic or cardiac etiology exsanguination of seroma. CT
abd without contrast at OSH showed marked anasarca, minimal
ascites. Abdominal ultrasound with ascites in right side of
abdomen, seroma around surigical site in LLQ, without hematoma.
Liver without cirrhotic changes. Provide daily wound care with
dressing changes and followup with outpatient surgery at [**Hospital **]Hospital for further management.
.
* Septicemia due to UTI:
Sepsis, medication-related, nausea/vomiting, PE, post-operative
volume depletion, hypothyroidism. Cardiac enzymes stable. Urine
cultures no growth. Lactate within normal. LENIs negative for
DVT. Thyroid panel normal. CT at OSH showed small pericardial
effusion. Echo revealed biventricular cavity enlargement with
severe systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse
process. Once BP stable, resumed on lasix, aldactone, and
started low-dose ACE inhibitor.
.
* Systolic CHF with pleural effusions and ascites:
Mild hypoxia. EF not known. V-paced on EKG. Biventricular cavity
enlargement with severe systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD
or other diffuse process. Moderate-severe aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. At
least moderate mitral regurgitaiton. Resumed lasix, aldactone,
started ACE inhibitor. BP remained normotensive on discharge.
.
* Elevated INR:
No risk factors for liver disease. Low albumin. Most likely from
CHF with hepatic congestion. Will need outpatient monitoring. No
evidence of active bleeding, Hct stable.
.
* UTI:
UA noted to be moderately positive for infection. WBC normal, pt
without fevers. Completed 7 day course of ciprofloxacin on
[**2184-6-2**]. Pt asymptomatic.
.
* Scrotal edema:
Surgery consulted, recommended scrotal elevation, should resorb
on its own.
.
*Prophylaxis: sc heparin, bowel regimen
*FEN: low Na, cardiac diet
*Access: PIVs
*Code Status: FULL
.
*Dispo:
PT cleared pt for DC. Discharge to rehab.
