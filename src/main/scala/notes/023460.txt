Chief Complaint:
syncopal episode

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 85 yr old female with Hx of AF/gastric AVMs/carotid
stenosis who fell from sitting position with +LOC. The patient
states that she was confused and thought she had been told that
there was rioting in [**Location (un) **] after the superbowl. She got up
very quickly to walk to the T.V. when she began feeling dizzy.
She felt as though she might lose consciousness, attempted to
sit down, and fell from the chair. The fall was witnessed by her
son who confirms LOC. Pt. denies any concommitant palpitations,
SOB, or CP. Patient denies the use of EtOH or any illegal
substances prior to the fall. The patient states that she has
been significantly SOB for the last 2-4 weeks, particularly in
the AM. She is unable to walk more than 15feet w/o becoming SOB.
The dyspnea usually resolves after a nebulizer Tx. She has also
been somewhat pale over the same time period. Pt. denies any
HA,F/C/N/V, changes in bowel or urinary habits, any melanotic
stools.
.
She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] & found to have SAH, & was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where repeat CT scan showed left tempo
parietel SAH. Pt noted to have Hct of 22.2 and INR of 1.6 on
admission and had guaiac+ brown stool. Pt otherwise stable and
alert upon arrival to TICU.

[**2119-12-26**] CT angio of head
IMPRESSION: No evidence of aneurysm of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**],
within the limitations of this examination technique. Findings
were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64602**] at time of exam by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

.
[**2119-12-26**] CT head without contrast
FINDINGS: There is a small amount of subarachnoid blood within
the left Sylvian fissure. There is no significant mass effect or
shift of normally midline structures. There is no evidence of
hydrocephalus. Note is made of cavum septum pellucidum at
vergae. Mild hypodensity in the periventricular cerebral white
matter is consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
Osseous structures are unremarkable without evidence of skull
fracture. There is a prominent left frontal subgaleal hematoma.

IMPRESSION: Small amount of left-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage
as described above.
.
[**2119-12-27**] CT head without contrast
FINDINGS: Again seen is a small amount of subarachnoid blood
within the left sylvian fissure. The left frontal subgaleal
hematoma is again noted. No other significant changes are noted.
There is no evidence of shift of normally midline structures or
impending herniation.

IMPRESSION: Stable small left sylvian fissure subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

Chest X-ray PA & L
CONCLUSION:
1. Single intact lead terminating at expected location of tip of
right ventricle.
2. New left pleural effusion and parenchymal consolidation at
the left lung base. Parenchymal consolidation could represent
some atelectasis or pneumonia and radiographic followup to
complete clearing is recommended to assure no underlying lesion
exists.
3. COPD.
4. Atherosclerosis including severe coronary artery plaque.
.
[**2120-1-4**]
Chest X-ray PA & L
1. Residual streaky opacity in the retrocardiac region, most
likely representing atelectasis.
2. Left effusion has significantly decreased in the interim,
with residual blunting of the costophrenic angle.
3. COPD.
4. Atherosclerosis involving the aorta and coronary arteries.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. SAH
On admission the patient was found to have a small SAH in L
Sylvian fissure, w/o any evidence of aneurysm in the Circle of
[**Location (un) 431**]. Her INR on admission was 1.4. Repeat CT Head
demonstrated stable hemorrage.The pt. did not have any
neurological Sx on admission and continued to remain
neurologically stable and mentating appropriately.  Per
neurosurgical recs the patient was placed on Phenytoin 100mg TID
for seizure prophylaxis for a total of 2wks. Her Coumadin was
d/c and will be restarted as an outpatient in 4wks ([**2120-1-24**]).
Plavix was initially d/c and then restarted on HD4.
.
2. Syncope
Given the patients's Hx of gastric AVMs her syncopal episode may
have been precipitated by intravascular depletion secondary to a
slow GI bleed. The patient's Hct fell from 30.4 on her last
admission ([**11-7**]) to 22.2 on this admission. Given patient's
history of afib with RVR and bradycardia during this admission,
her syncope episode may have been secondary to a combination of
cardiac factors, in addition her Hx of DM may have also had
autonomic instability. The patient was ruled out for an MI x3.
Her troponins remained <0.01 and her EKG was unchanged from
previous exam. On transfer to the Medicine service the pt. was
orthostatic w/ a 20 point drop in SBP from supine to sitting.
There was no significant increase in HR given that the patient
was beta blocked.  The patient was monitored on telemetry
throughout her hospitalization.  She did have multiple
tachy/brady episodes, but did not have any syncopal episodes
during the admission.
.
3. Cardiovascular
.
Cor
The patient is s/p atherectomy to mid-LAD and distal LAD, DES to
the LAD 2.5 X 28mm. Coumadin was held due to SAH. Plavix was
also held by request of Neurosurgery but later restarted.  The
patient was maintained on aspirin and statin.
.
Pump
optimal BP control: The patient was maintained on captopril and
BB. Digoxin has been d/c because it is contraindicated for
patient's in this age range, and it is unnecessary given that
the patient remained rate controlled on BB and CCB.
.
Rhythm  (afib w/ RVR)
Pt. is in chronic Afib, and had some skipped beats and 3
episodes of bradycardia to 30s during her course, twice while
sleeping and once when awake. Pt. also had approx 4 episodes in
total of tachycardia with ambulation (150s) and at rest (170s).
On HD3 the pt. had two tachycardic events overnight HR 179, and
had 2 triggers called that AM.  10:30AM - asymptomatic
tachycardia HR 150, and 11:30am - asymptomatic bradycardia HR 29
while sleeping, then 38 when awake. During her tachycardia she
responded to 5 IV dilt. The bradycardic event did not require
any additional diagnositc tests or intervention, and resolved
spontaneously.  The patient was asymptomatic during all events
above mentioned events. EP was consulted and the patient was
scheduled placement of a single lead pacemaker on [**1-3**]. Her
Coumadin was d/c given her SAH and will be restarted on
