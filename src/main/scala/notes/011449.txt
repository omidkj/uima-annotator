Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
presenting for elective procedure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary vein isolation
tranvenous pacemaker placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61 year old male with chronic refractory atrial
fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension who presented following
elective pulmonary vein isolation. He has undergone many
different treatment options, including an atrial fibrillation
ablation, amiodarone therapy and multiple cardioversions. His
most recent cardioversion was on [**2200-10-21**] that briefly
converted him to sinus rhythm, however he promptly reverted to
atrial fibrillation 1-2 minutes following the
procedure. He was referred for another attempt at pulmonary vein
isolation. He had completed pulmonary vein isolation and
received DC cardioversion. He developed sinus arrest post
cardioversion and had a coronary sinus pacemaker placed to
support his heart rate. He was intubated during the procedure
but was extubated prior to arrival in the CCU. He did receive an
amiodarone 150 mg x1 IV.
.
Upon arrival in the CCU, he had one episode of emesis. This was
not associated with chest pain, diaphoresis or abdominal pain.
He is not dizzy and has no palpitations. He denies morning
headaches, daytime sleepiness, or snoring. Does not know if he
has had apneic spells while sleeping.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 61 year old man with recurrent atrial
fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and obesity who presented for
attempt at restoration of sinus rhythm via pulmonary vein
isolation which was complicated by sinus arrest.

1.) Cardiovascular:
a. Rhythm - As above, the patient underwent PVI and subsequently
developed sinus arrest requiring placement of a transvenous
pacer into the coronary sinus. He was monitored for recovery of
sinus activity which did occur spontaneously.  He was weaned
from the temporary pacemaker and remained stable in sinus
rhythm.  His blood pressure was stable following removal of the
temporary pacer.  Given his history of of syncope, it was
explained to him that he had a high likelihood of ultimately
needing a permanent pacemaker. Sinus nodal agents were held.  He
was loaded with amiodarone and was bridged to therapeutic
coumadin with LMWH.  He will be discharged with a Holter monitor
and have the following testing as an outpatient: Cardio-Net,
CMR, and TEE in 1 month.
.
b. Pump - The patient presented euvolemic by exam but did have
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7216**] pressure of 35mmHg during the PVI. Given his
obesity, he should be referred for a sleep study to evaluate for
sleep apnea.  He remained on his home dose lasix.  TEE follow-up
as above.  He was started on low dose ACEi and spironolactone
with instructions to have his Cr and K checked within a few days
of discharge. His beta-blocker was discontinued as above.
.
c. Ischemia - There were no active issues.  He continued on
aspirin daily.  His lipids from [**8-13**] (TG 97, HDL 31, LDL 64)
were at reasonable goal levels.
.
2) Diabetes: His most recent was A1C 6.9% and he has evidence of
mild microalbuminuria. His outpatient insulin regimen was
restarted after he began to take oral nutrition. He was started
on an ACEi given his chronic kidney disease risk factors.
.
3) FEN: diabetic/cardiac diet.
.
4) Anemia - The patient has a chronic normocytic anemia with low
normal platelets. His prior iron studies not c/w iron
deficiency. He has mild B12 deficiency [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**5-13**] eval likely
related to gastric bypass. This admission repeat B12 normal and
retic index 0.5. He continued on his B12 supplementation and
will follow-up as an outpatient.
.
5) Prophy: no PPI indicated. heparin gtt. incentive spirometer
.

You have been evaluated and treated for atrial fibrillation.
You underwent an ablation procedure to prevent the arrhythmia
