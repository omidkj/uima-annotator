Admission Date:  [**2173-8-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2173-9-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2152-3-29**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU/MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 21 year old
gentleman with a history of [**Hospital Ward Name 37702**] syndrome who initially
presented to [**Hospital3 2358**] on [**2173-8-12**], with altered mental
status.  The patient was in his usual state of health until
five days prior to admission when he noticed that his eyes
were blurry and he was bumping into things.  He called his
psychiatrist on the day prior to admission and was started on
Risperdal 1 mg p.o. q3hours with instructions to titrate up.
On the night of admission, the patient's blood sugar also
increased to 390 and he called his endocrinologist who
recommended increasing his Humalog.  One hour later, the
patient took another six units of Humalog for a blood sugar
of 236.  The patient subsequently began snorting and having
difficulty swallowing and acting "quite dazed" per his
mother's report.  He was mumbling and EMS was called.  The
patient was intubated in the field for airway protection
during witnessed grand mal seizure with jaw clenching, head
turning and unresponsiveness.  Upon arrival to the Emergency
Department, the patient was intubated and found to have a
blood sugar of 58.  The patient was hemodynamically stable
and started on a Versed drip for persistent seizure activity.

Briefly, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course at [**Hospital3 2358**]
included Oxacillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia
treated with Oxacillin.  The patient was stabilized from a
neurologic standpoint on Dilantin without further seizure
activity (there was concern that initial seizure activity was
due to hypoglycemia as the patient has no known seizure
disorder).  He had a neurologic evaluation with
electroencephalogram revealing just generalized
encephalopathy without focal seizure activity.  The patient
also had an EMG, which revealed no neuromuscular weakness as
a cause for failure to wean from ventilator.  The patient had
recurrent difficulty weaning from ventilator despite
treatment of his pneumonia.  He was originally intubated for
airway protection, however, a trial of extubation was done on
[**2173-8-16**], and the patient developed respiratory distress
within four hours of extubation and was reintubated.  The
patient subsequently self extubated on [**2173-8-24**], with an
episode of agitation, was placed on a nonrebreather, however,
desaturated into the 50s and required reintubation.
Physicians at [**Hospital3 2358**] recommended tracheostomy, however,
the patient's family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 346**] for a second opinion by pulmonology,
which is how the patient arrived at our facility.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is single and lived
independently prior to admission.  He is relatively close to
his grandmother who helps him with his cooking.  His parents
are very involved and supportive and live in the area.  He
works at [**Company 10414**] and denies tobacco or alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Grandmother with type 2 diabetes mellitus
and Alzheimer's.  Maternal grandfather with cancer of the
bones in his 60s.  No other relatives with [**Name (NI) 37702**] syndrome.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission on [**2173-8-29**],
temperature is 97, heart rate 72, normal sinus rhythm, blood
pressure 104/57, vent setting SIMV with pressure support
500cc by 10 breaths per minute, PEEP 5, FIO2 40%, saturating
94 to 100%.  In general, the patient is a diaphoretic male in
no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat -
Mucous membranes are moist.  The oropharynx is clear.  The
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs
or gallops.  Lung examination is clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema, 2+ distal pulses.  Skin - no rash or petechiae.
Neurologic examination - The patient is alert and seemingly
oriented, following commands and moving all extremities with
2+ deep tendon reflexes.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory studies included white
blood cell count 10.9 with normal differential, hematocrit
37.0.  Potassium 4.3, sodium 145, creatinine 0.5. Normal
liver function tests.

Radiologic studies at outside hospital showed on [**2173-8-19**],
head MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4493**] consistent with atrophy of the brain
stem into the upper cervical cord with probable mild
cerebellar atrophy.  Left sphenoid and frontal sinus
opacification.

A normal EMG was performed on [**2173-8-26**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary - The patient without known pulmonary
dysfunction at baseline, however, there is a question of
brain stem atrophy and dysfunction, also baseline paCO2 in
the high 40s low 50s, these [**Date Range 4493**] concerning for probable
hypoventilation.  Chronicity of mild hypercarbia is unknown.
However, since intubation for airway protection during
seizure, the patient has failed extubation times four.  The
patient underwent trial of extubation on [**2173-9-3**], at [**Hospital1 1444**] and subsequently developed
acute respiratory distress with inspiratory stridor. The
patient had emergent reintubation which was very difficult
requiring placement of endotracheal tube over a bougie
catheter.  A grade II view was obtained and a 6.5 French
endotracheal tube was placed.  There was felt to be a
significant component of airway edema and collapse at that
time.  The patient had multiple respiratory mechanic trials
while intubated which revealed a negative inspiratory force
of negative 20 mmHg which is significantly impaired.  This
was at a time when the patient had defervesced and was doing
well on pressure support.  Thus, a repeat EMG and
neuromuscular consultation was obtained to rule out
neuromuscular etiologies of hypoventilation.  An EMG was
essentially normal except for hyperexcitable axones which is
a nonspecific yet abnormal finding.  Interpretation of this
is unclear.  However, there is no acute axonal loss or
myopathy which could have caused his hypoventilation.  CKs
are normal and there is no evidence of myositis.  A muscle
biopsy was not performed.

The patient developed severe bilateral Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia while he was admitted at [**Hospital1 1444**].  The patient had significant
hypoxemia and required maximal ventilatory support for
approximately ten days.  The patient had multiple episodes of
lobar collapse bilaterally requiring emergent bronchoscopy
due to paO2 in the 40s and 50s and acute desaturation.  The
patient had copious thick secretions which prevented weaning
from ventilator for approximately two weeks.  He was treated
with Vancomycin 1 gram p.o. q12hours for ten days and
continued to clinically deteriorate from his Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and consolidations.
