Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Neurosurgery, Plastic
surgery, Vascular, Orthopedics and Behavioral Neurology were
consulted given his multiple injuries.
There was initial concern for possible vascular injury of his
left foot, but was found to be neurovascularly intact. He was
later taken to for an angiogram of his left lower extremity
which showed bilateral patent renal arteries, no evidence of
aortoiliac atherosclerotic disease and no evidence of
flow-limiting stenoses, patent left common femoral artery,
patent superficial femoral artery, patent left profunda femoris
arteries, patent profunda femoris artery and patent popliteal
artery on the left.

He was taken to the operating room by Orthopedics and Plastics
for debridement of skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle with
repair of complex laceration of forehead
approximately 15-cm; irrigation and debridement, extensive, to
bone of left lower extremity degloving injury and grade 3A open
tibia-fibula fracture; application and removal of multiplane
external fixator to grade 3 open left tibia-fibula fracture;
intramedullary rod fixation of segmental, grade 3A open left
tibia-fibula fracture;
primary repair of left peroneus longus tendon and application of
extensive vacuum-assisted closure dressing. He would
subsequently undergo further washout procedures and
re-application of the VAC dressing.

Plastics was consulted for evaluation for free flap and skin
grafting. At the request of Plastics a Cardiology consult was
placed for operative clearance. His medications were optimized
and he was given clearance. Patient was taken to the OR on [**11-22**]
for a Right latissiums flap, right thigh skin grafting to left
lower extremity and did well following this procedure.  Given
the presence of osteomyelitis culture positive for morganella
and proteus from path specimen, he will be discharged on IV
vancomycin and PO ciprofloxacin for a course of six weeks
beginning [**2122-11-21**].

His neurosurgical issues were managed non operatively as there
was no intracranial hemorrhage identified. His head CT revealed
a soft tissue hematoma and likely laceration involving the scalp
overlying the right frontal bone.

He was also evaluated by Behavioral Neurology for a cognitive
evaluation and probable mild traumatic brain injury. It was
recommended to minimize any medications that would alter his
mental status.

Physical and Occupational therapy were also consulted and have
recommended rehab after his acute hospital stay.
