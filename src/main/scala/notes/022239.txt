Allergies:
Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status due to sepsis secondary to urinary tract
infection.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation in the medical intensive care unit.


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old WF with a history of hypertension and sepsis [**2-2**]
urinary tract infection, who originally presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
with altered mental status, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2196-1-10**] for
further management of sepsis [**2-2**] urinary tract infection. Now
called out to the general medicine floor following 9 day
hospital course in the MICU.
.
Was originally transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to persistent
hypotension and bradycardia in the setting of positive urine
analysis. Was intubated for airway protection and started on
vancomycin/zosyn. MICU team attributed bradycardia to
hyperkalemia on presentation and poor atenolol excretion [**2-2**]
acute kidney injury. Required increasing pressor support with
dopamine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin. Of note, she had a
positive UA on presentation here, though cultures from
[**Hospital1 **] and here have remained negative (here she had
corynebacterium in one culture which was likely a contaminant).
She also had been taking ciprofloxacin prior to her arrival to
[**Hospital1 **] for a UTI. She has completed a 7 day course of
vancomycin and 8 day course of zosyn.
.
Pressor support was gradually weaned and patient was extubated
on [**2196-1-15**]. Her MICU course has been complicated by new atrial
fibrillation with RVR, for which she was initially given dilt IV
and dilt PO without improvement in her rate (100s-110s). She was
started on an amiodarone load approx 36 hours after atrial fib
onset and converted to sinus rhythm 6 hours later.
.
Transition off of pressors was performed with albumin volume
resuscitation. Due to development of pedal edema and findings of
mild interstitial edema on chest xray, patient was started on
lasix gtt for volume removal which was transitioned to lasix IV
boluses with goal removal of negative 1L daily. Of note, she had
presented with [**Last Name (un) **] with baseline creatinine of 1.0, but her
creatinine has increased to 2.0 in the MICU. Her lisinopril has
been held.
.
Hospital course also complicated by development of diarrhea with
positive c. diff stool culture. Started on IV metronidazole on
[**2196-1-17**]. Following extubation, she was evaluated by speech and
swallow and not quite felt safe for diet, but able to take
crushed meds. Over the weekend, her diet was advanced by MICU
team without difficulty.
.
On the floor, patient reports that she feels fine, denies any
complaints and wants to go home as soon as possible. Reports
that she had [**2-3**] loose stools overnight. Brown in color, no
blood.

ECG [**2196-1-10**]:  Artifact is present. Regular supraventricular

at 280 milliseconds. Compared to the previous tracing sinus
rhythm is now apparent and the P-R interval is prolonged.

ECG [**2196-1-10**]:  Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is prolonged at 260
milliseconds. Compared to the previous tracing there is no
significant change. TRACING #3.

Chest Radiograph [**2196-1-10**]:  IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly with mild interstitial edema.
2. Endotracheal tube tip 2.5 cm from carina.
3. Kink noted within the right IJ catheter.
.
ECHO [**2196-1-12**]:  The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
