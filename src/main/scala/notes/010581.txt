Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, diarrhea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
extubation

History of Present Illness:
58F with a history of C. diff colitis admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**9-30**] with abdominal pain, diarrhea, confusion, and
generalized weakness. WBC# 10.5 with 25% bands, Cr 1.7. CT
abdomen showed diffuse concentric colonic thickening, as well as
possible acalculous cholecystitis. HIDA scan did not show
cholecystitis or obstruction. She was treated with IVF and
neosynephrine for BP 79/43 on presentation and transferred to
the ICU. She was started on IV flagyl and PO vancomycin for
presumed recurrent severe c. diff colitis. PO was changed to PR
vanco on [**10-2**] out of concern for ileus. She was intubated for
respiratory failure attributed to acute pulmonary edema on the
morning of [**10-2**]. TropI peaked at 0.48 on [**10-3**], TTE showed
diffuse LV hypokinesis with EF ~25%. She was treated with bolus
diuresis and extubation was attempted [**10-5**] but she reportedly
had recurrent flash pulmonary edema and needed to be
reintubated. Treated with PPN. Course also complicated by acute
on chronic anemia, for which she was transfused 2U pRBC (Hct
26.1->33.9). V/S prior to transfer 98.3 128-151/63-93 80-100
19-22 94% on 500x12/5/0.6.

On arrival here, complains of discomfort at the ETT site but
denies fever, chills, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, nausea.

Past Medical History:
C. diff colitis [**12-26**]
Seizure disorder
Bipolar disorder with prior suicide attempt
Anxiety disorder
Fibromyalgia
Rotator cuff repair [**12-26**]

Social History:
Lives in [**Hospital1 392**] with her husband. Smoked 1.5-2 ppd x 50 years.

IMAGING
============
[**2104-10-6**]
- CXR: Endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina.
Right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC. A nasogastric tube
courses into the stomach. Bilateral pleural effusions are seen
with associated atelectasis. Left-sided atelectasis is greater
involving a large portion of the left lower lobe. Mild pulmonary
vascular engorgement is also seen. There is no pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis, significantly greater on the left.
2. Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right subclavian
line in satisfactory position without evidence of pneumothorax.

[**2104-10-7**]
- TTE: There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 35%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Global left ventricular
hypokinesis (Left ventricular dysfunction appears to involve
both anterior and inferor territories, but suboptimal image
quality prevents detailed segmental analysis).

Brief Hospital Course:
58F with recurrent severe C. diff colitis admitted with
hypoxemic respiratory failure.

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure- Attributable to acute pulmonary
edema from myocardial dysfunction and aggressive fluid
resuscitation in the setting of sepsis.  Patient was
aggressively diuresed prior to extubation.  Also her anxiety was
managed by home medication Ativan prior to extubation.  She did
well post extubation.  Echocardiogram was ordered to re-evaluate
her cardiac function, which showed a slightly improved EF (35%)
compared to her [**Hospital3 **] echo.  She was continued on
Lisinopril, and she was started on a low dose of daily lasix.
We recommend follow up with Cardiology, as the etiology of her
heart failure is not entirely clear, although we suspect a
combination of chronic alcohol abuse and severe illness with
volume resuscitation.

#Septic shock-
Pt was in septic shock at [**Hospital3 **], and her OSH CT showed
severe colitis and she had a bandemia.  She was treated
empirically as recurrent c.diff with Vanc/Flagyl, however, all
of the c-diff tox screens returned negative.  Her abdominal
exam/diarrhea improved with treatment, so she was continued on
an empiric course of 14 days po vanc/flagyl despite lack of
positive tox screen.

#Acute systolic heart failure.  Thought due to sepsis.  Repeat
TTE here at [**Hospital1 18**] showed improved EF compared to [**Hospital3 **]
(25% improved to 35%).  She was continued on BB, ACE inhibitor,
as well as Lasix. Her lasix dose was titrated to maintain
euvolemia. She was instructed to get cardiology referral from
her PCP

#Epilepsy/Bipolar.  Non-active.  Patient continued with home
Depakote.

#Depression/anxiety.  She was restarted on her Ativan prior to
extubation, as she exhibited significant anxiety during the
hospitalizati
