ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Lateral ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2199-4-19**] the QRS change in lead V3 is
probably positional.
.
.
CXR:
This study is mildly compromised secondary to body habitus and
lordotic positioning. Within those limitations, no consolidation
or superimposed edema is identified. The previously noted
cephalization has resolved. Mediastinum is unremarkable. The
cardiac silhouette is top normal for size. No pleural effusion
or pneumothorax is definitely evident. The bones are diffusely
osteopenic.



Brief Hospital Course:
1)  Acute Exacarbation of COPD:
Pt's symptoms were most consistent with COPD exacerbation in the
setting of decreased compliance with oxygen and BIPAP.
Hypercarbic on arrival to ED (baseline CO2 is high 50s-low 60s)
but responded well to BIPAP.  Also started on azithro, steroids,
and nebulizers.  Within 24h, her respiratory status improved and
she was back on her baseline home O2 requirement.
Nocturnal Bipap was continued.  Prednisone was continued at 60mg
for several days and then weaned down slolwy with plan for 2
week taper.  She completed a 5d course of azithro.  When
ambulating, she also felt that her breathing was at baseline.
She was set up to see a pulmonologist as she states she does not
have one.
.
2) Hypertension:
Pt was noted to have elevated BP throughout admission.
Initially put on outpt regimen of amlodipoine and lisinopril.
Then hydralazine added for continued hypertension.  Will need
further adjustment as outpt.
.
3) Leukocytosis:  At 15 on discharge. Consistent with steroid
induced demargination. No signs of active infection.  Should
have repeated at next PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
.
4) Cognitive impairment:
Throughout admission, pt noted to have short term memory
defecits.  This has been noted by care providers on prior
admission but she states she had never had an evaluation.  [**Month (only) 116**]
represent mild dementia.  Pt should have formal neuropsych
testing as outpt.
.
5) Psych:
Continued on outpt regimen.
