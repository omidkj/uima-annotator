HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
From a pulmonary standpoint, the patient has a history of
asthma, however, prior to the past one month has been very
stable and her asthma has been very mild requiring albuterol
MDI very rarely.  The etiology of her recent asthma flares
remains unclear, however, it is possible that medical
noncompliance secondary to cost and inability to fill her
prescriptions may have been contributing.  In addition,
possible allergen exposure and/or infection may have
precipitated her recent episodes.  The patient was initially
admitted to the MICU service as she was intubated in the
field, and required ventilatory support.

On hospital day #1, the patient was extubated and her sats
remained stable.  At the time of discharge, she is sating 97%
on room air and without any wheezes on examination.  The
patient was also ambulating without any dyspnea or
desaturation on pulse oximetry.  Patient was treated with IV
steroids which were then changed to a po prednisone taper.
She is also given albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, and
restarted on her MDI's.  The patient received no additional
antibiotics other than the Levaquin that she received in the
Emergency Department as she showed no signs or symptoms of
infection.  She received one dose of Singulair as well.

The Learning Center was consulted regarding education with
peak flows and use of MDI's.

From a cardiovascular standpoint, patient was continued on
the ACE inhibitor portion of her outpatient
antihypertensives.  The hydrochlorothiazide was held as the
patient was felt to be dehydrated clinically on admission.
She is being discharged on her previous medication, however.

Regarding her hypercholesterolemia, the patient was given a
low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.
