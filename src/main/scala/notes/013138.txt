MICRO:
[**11-30**] Urine Cx positive for E.coli.  Sensitive to Cipro, Gent,
Nitro; Intermediate to Amp/Sulbactam; Resistant to Amp, Bactrim.
[**12-5**] Urine Cx positive for E.coli.  Same sensitivities.

IMAGING:
[**12-6**] Renal U/S showed heterogeneous echogenecity in the upper
pole of L kidney which could correspond to hydronephrosis.  Also
showed no evidence of perinephric fluid or abscess.  No
hydronephrosis.

[**12-6**] Abd CT showed: 1) Striated nephrogram on the left, with
perinephric stranding, findings consistent with pyelonephritis.
No renal abscess.  2) Trace free fluid within abdomen and pelvis

[**12-8**] CXR showed interval development of left lower lobe
consolidation which could represent pneumonia

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pyelonephritis/UTI
The patient arrived in the ED on [**12-5**] with the following VS:
T102.1, P119, BP 113/60, RR 20, Sat 100%.  Three hours later her
BP dropped to 91/34, then 75/54.  The pt then received 4L NS
bolus.  She also received Tordol, Levofloxacin, and Tylenol.  A
code sepsis was called at 1AM after fluid resuscitation failed.
A renal U/S and an abdominal CT were consistent with
pyelonephritis.
.
The pt was transferred to the MICU and her BP stabilized without
pressors.  She remained stable in the MICU with the exception of
occasional fever spikes and ongoing N/V.  A urine culture grew
E. coli which was resistant to Bactrim and Ampicillin, and
sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin, and Nitrofurantoin (with
intermediate sensitivity to Unasyn).  Pt was started on
Gentamicin and Ceftriaxone.
.
On [**12-8**] the pt was called out to the floor.  She continued to
have fever spikes, rigors, nausea, L CVA tenderness and
developed a mild non-productive cough.  Her R IJ catheter was
removed and a CXR showed a new left lower lobe consolidation
which "could represent pneumonia."  She continued to spike
occasional temps although her fever curve began trending
downwards.  Her PO intake was poor secondary to her nausea,
which was treated with Compazine and Anzemet.  Gentamicin was
discontinued on [**12-8**].  Levofloxacin was discontinued on [**12-9**].
The patient was discharged home on [**12-10**] on PO Cefpodoxime.
