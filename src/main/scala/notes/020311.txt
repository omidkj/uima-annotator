Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Upper GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy [**5-25**]: grade 1 varices, portal gastropathy, no
stigmata of recent bleed


History of Present Illness:
Pt is s 67 yo m with arotic valve replacement and hep C who was
transfered from an OSH the [**Hospital1 18**] ER with a GI bleed. Pt stated
that starting about 1 week ago he had crampy abd pain in the
epigastic area. No prior episodes. Then yesterday he had two
episodes of black diarrhea. This morning he had another episode.
Also this AM he became nauseated and had black colored emesis x
1. He states he was lightheaded sitting on the edge of the bed
today and got up to go to the bathroom, then passed out in the
[**Doctor Last Name **]. He woke up and his wife called EMS. He denies any prior
syncoped. No current abdominial or chest pain. No further BMs or
emesis since coming to ER at OSH. Per EMS notes his SBP was 84
on arrival to his house.
.
At the OSH he his hct was 28, INR 2.67. He was given [**12-10**] liter
of NS, IV protonix, and zofran 4mg IV. Was guaiac and
gastroccult postitive. He was then transfered to [**Hospital1 **]. In the ER
here, his BP was briefly in the 70s, then responded to 500mg
bolus of NS. Also continued on protonix. He was transfered to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Did not get lavaged. GI team was notifed. VS at
transfer in ER were 77 afib, 102/41, 15, 100%RA.
.
On arrival to the floor, was not orthostatic BP initally in low
100s, then transiently in 70s. Responded to 500ml bolus NS, back
to 100s. Repeat hct was 23.3. NG lavage attempted and pt unable
to swallow tube.


Past Medical History:

EGD:  Impression
Erythema, congestion and granularity in the stomach body
representing possible portal gastropathy.
There was evidence of possible grade I varices. There was no
stigmata of recent bleeding and no high risk features.
Small hiatal hernia
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

CXR:
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW CHEST:
REASON FOR EXAM: AVR, upper GI bleed.
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable. New moderate pulmonary edema. If
any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions. Sternal wires
are aligned.
.
Cardiac Echo:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Following hospital summary is by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], as I assumed care
for this patient on day of discharge:
.
.
.
67 yo m with hx of mechanical aortic valve, was transfered from
OSH with an upper GI bleed with intermitent hypotension and
falling hct in setting pt on coumadin for mechanical valves.
.
# Upper GI Bleed:  EGD showed possible portal gastropathy,
possible grade 1 varices, but no stigmata of recent bleeding.
The bleeding source has likely resolved.  His baseline HCT is 40
(41 in [**12-17**] at OSH).  On arrival, his HCT was 28, fell to 23,,
and stabilized at 27 after 4 units of PRBCs.  He was not
reversed for his elevated INR given no active bleeding and
mechanical valve, but coumadin was held as his INR was
therapeutic >2.5 to 3.  He was initially started on a PPI gtt
which was transitioned to po PPI [**Hospital1 **].  He did not have any
further episodes of bleeding and did not require further
transfusions. his coumadin was resumed when INR subtherapeutic
and he did not have further drop in H/H with this.
.
# Hypotension:  Patient was intermittently hypotensive to
systolics of 70s despite no change in HR (on dig) or mental
status.  The cause is not clear.  His blood pressure responded
to minimal IVFs.  He did have an ECHO, which showed normal EF
and normal AV function.  He was also briefly started on
levo/flagyl for concern of aspiration pneumonia, however this
was subsequently discontinued, as the probability of this was
thought to be very low. Patient's blood pressure seemed to
stabilize, and there were no further episodes of hypotension.
.
# Hypoxia, likely [**1-10**] volume overload and COPD:  Patient
developed an O2 requirement during his stay after IVFs and
pRBCs.  CXR showed some increasing pulm edema and sml bilateral
pleural effusions, will likely resolve on own, did not start
lasix as he was weaned off of O2.   There was also concern for
COPD given extensive smoking history, wheezing on exam, and
hyperinflated lungs on CXR.  He was treated with nebulizers to
which he reponded well; he was provided a prescription for
combivent on discharge.
.
# St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] aortic valve replacement:  Coumadin was initially
held but INR remained therapeutic to supratherapeutic.  His INR
was never reversed, and his coumadin was resumed at 1mg qhs
during the hospitalization (when INR was 3.1) with the goal of
keeping his INR within the therapeutic range.  Despite the
episode of bleeding, I would recommend keep
