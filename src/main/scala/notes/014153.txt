Chief Complaint:
fever, rinorrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bipap

History of Present Illness:
62M w/ refractory biphenotypic leukemia, hx disseminated
fusarium and multiple prior treatments (hyperCVAD, 7+3 [**4-30**],
decitabine, MEC [**9-25**], several more cycles decitabine last [**3-16**])
who presents with neutropenic fever.  He also has a history of
enterococcal empyema, admitted [**Date range (1) 82695**] w/ sepsis from E coli
bacteremia which was complicated by AF w/ RVR and empyema.  He
received a chest tube for drainaige and was discharged on
voriconazole, linezolid, and ertapenem as outpatienton.  He was
then readmitted from [**Date range (1) 24818**] with fever and concern for soft
tissue [**Date range (1) 2**].  His Ertapenam was switched to Cefepime, and
his empyema and effusions improved.  He was discharged on 4
additional days of cefepime for a total of 5 days.
.
The patient reports that he developed clear rinorrhea 4 days
prior to admission that resulted in subsequent sore throat and
voice change 1-2 days later.  He then developed a non-productive

Past Medical History:
.
Hematologic History:
1) followed since [**2154**] for an autoimmune pancytopenia treated
with steroids and IVIG.
2) In [**3-/2157**] his cytopenias worsened and he was noted to have
about 90% blasts and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Preliminary
bone marrow biopsy was suspicious for a biphenotypic leukemia
3) therapy was initiated with hyperCVAD. His day 14 marrow
showed persistent disease
4) Regimen was changed to 7+3. Day 14 and 2 subsequent marrows
all continued to show persistent involvement with leukemia.
5) Further chemotherapy was held as MR. [**Known lastname 1005**] was found to
have disseminated fusarium [**Known lastname 2**] in the setting of prolonged

neutropenia and was treated with a prolonged course of AmBisome
with voricoanzole before transitioning to voriconazole alone.
6) He has subsequently been treated with Dacogen with
refractory disease;
7) He has had several admissions for pericardial effusions
with tamponade physiology, treated medically;
8) He has had periodic pleural effusions requiring thoracentesis

with transudative to exudative chemistries; cell blocks and flow

cytometry have not been suggestive of leukemic infiltration, and

work up for infectious causes including viral, fungal and AFB
have remained unrevealing.
9) admission for VRE bacteremia presumed to be of line
origin though line tip cultures were unrevealing and completed a

prolonged course of linezolid.
9) admission in late [**Month (only) 956**] 2012for acute shortness of
[**Month (only) 1440**], fevers and found to have an enterococcal empyema.
10) Prior HBV [**Month (only) 2**], on lamivudine prophylaxis.
11) admitted [**Date range (1) 82695**] w/ sepsis from E coli bacteremia, AF w/
RVR, pleural effusions, and discharged on voriconazole,
linezolid, and ertapenem.
12) He was then readmitted from [**Date range (1) 24818**] with fever and concern
for soft tissue [**Date range (1) 2**].  His Ertapenam was switched to
Cefepime, and his empyema and effusions improved.  He was
discharged on 4 additional days of cefepime for a total of 5
days

3. Disseminated fusarium [**First Name3 (LF) 2**], treated with Ambisome and
Voriconazole for four and half months. Ambisome was stopped on
[**10-20**]. Last voriconazole level was 1.0 on [**10-8**]
4. HBV, on Lamivudine
