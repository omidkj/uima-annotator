Microbiology:
Urine culture x2= negative
Blood culture x4= negative

Studies:
CXRay [**12-7**]: IMPRESSION: Left lung consolidation, compatible
with pneumonia.

CXray [**12-8**]: IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe pneumonia.

Colonoscopy [**12-5**]:
Impression: Normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: Recommend capsule endoscopy for further
evaluation of melena. Colonoscopy in 5 years

Upper endoscopy [**12-5**]:
Impression: Small hiatal hernia
Erythema and erosion in the fundus
Erythema in the antrum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations: Will proceed to colonoscopy for evaluation of
melena.
Continue PPI.

Small capsule study:
1. Sub-optimal bowel prep with a moderate amount of food debris
in the stomach and segments of the jejunum.
2. Erythema in the stomach (gastritis).
3. A few petechiae in the proximal jejunum .
4. Two angioectasias in the proximal jejunum.
5. No active blee
