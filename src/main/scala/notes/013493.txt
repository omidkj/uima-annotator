PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today on physical examination, the
patient's vital signs are temperature 97.8 F, blood pressure
ranging 120 to 110/93 to 50, heart rate ranging 71 to 68,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 99% on two liters and
then 97% on room air. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination, anicteric sclera, extraocular movements intact,
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation. Heart, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,
rubs or gallops at this time. Lungs have diffuse crackles
bilaterally which appear to be worse with expiration. Abdomen
was soft and nontender and nondistended, there are positive
bowel sounds. Extremities, trace pretibial edema.

LABORATORY DATA: White blood cell count 10.7, hematocrit
30.6, platelet count 375,000.

Sodium 145, potassium 3.9, chloride 103, bicarbonate 28,
blood, urea and nitrogen 53, creatinine 1.4, glucose 113.

Last chest x-ray on [**2112-7-31**], shows cephalization, right
lower lobe infiltrate and minimal change from the previous
chest x-ray. However, the patient appears clinically improved
since the day that chest x-ray was taken.

HOSPITAL COURSE: This is an eighty-year-old white female with
a history of hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol
who was transferred from the MICU where she was admitted for
shortness of breath which required intubation. Briefly, the
patient presented to [**Hospital1 69**]
with a two day history of shortness of breath with acute
worsening, starting on [**2112-7-25**]. The patient was treated
with intravenous Lasix and Nitroglycerin by the Emergency
Medical Services, then she was emergently intubated for
increased respiratory rate and decreased oxygen saturation,
also by Emergency Medical Services. A chest x-ray showed
bilateral pneumonia and she also had white blood cell count
of 22 on admission. The patient had a 1 mm to [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
depression in V4 and V5 on electrocardiogram and at that time
was tachycardiac with a heart rate of 120. In the MICU was
ruled out for myocardial infarction by serial enzymes and was
initially started on Ceftriaxone and Zithromax for community
acquired pneumonia. The patient was diuresed and the chest
x-ray improved.

On [**2112-7-28**], the patient had an echocardiogram done
which showed mild left atrium dilation, mild symmetrical left
ventricular hypertrophy and severe global hypokinesis with an
ejection fraction of 20%, also trace mitral regurgitation,
tricuspid regurgitation and aortic regurgitation. The patient
was started on aspirin, on beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.
The patient was also found to have a urinary tract infection
which was found to be caused by E. Coli found to be pan
sensitive to antibiotics.

The patient improved fast and was extubated on [**2112-7-30**].
The patient was then transferred to the general medicine
floor where once again, she improved even faster, her oxygen
saturation is currently 96% on room air. The patient has
crackles but is breathing well without effort. The patient is
able to swallow and eat solids. After being started on ACE
inhibitors for two days, the creatinine went up from 1.2 to
1.6 and then went down to 1.4 yesterday. Therefore, the ACE
inhibitors were decreased from 12.5 three times a day to 6.25
three times a day.

DISCHARGE CONDITION: The patient's condition at discharge is
good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: The patient is discharged on
medications, Lopressor 50 mg three times a day, Captopril
6.25 mg three times a day, Aldactone 25 mg every day,
Levofloxacin 250 mg every twenty-four hours, to be continued
for another four days to complete one week course, Albuterol
nebulizers, Lipitor 10 mg, aspirin 325 mg every day and
Furosemide currently 60 mg every day to be further arranged
by her cardiologist or primary care physician.
