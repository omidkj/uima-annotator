Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Atypical chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2180-7-23**]
1. Left ventricular lead placement with left thoracotomy.
2. Generator change.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old male with a past medical history
significant for congestive heart failure with ICD placement in
[**2178-10-30**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, history of stroke,
mitral valve regurgitation status post two mitral valve
surgeries, aortic insufficiency, history of cardiac arrest in
the
setting of hypokalemia and hyperlipidemia.  He recently
presented
to [**Hospital6 33**] complaining of atypical chest pain. The
patient has no known coronary disease based on previous cardiac
catheterizations.  A CXR revealed cardiomegaly, without signs of
congestive heart failure. His amiodarone had been recentlty
discontinued. The patient denied any associated fever, chills,
or
malaise.  The chest pain at that time was thought to be cardiac
pain. He also notes extreme fatigue and dyspnea with exertion.
His amiodarone was stopped with improvement in his symptoms. It
was decided that he would be best served with biventricular
pacing to help alleviate his symptoms however it was felt that
it
would be best performed either by thoracotomy or thoracoscopy.
The patient was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] last week and is now
being referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for thorascopic versus left
thoracotomy, left ventricular epicardial lead placement to
upgrade his ICD to a biventriclar pacemaker. He is being
admitted
today for heparin bridge therapy and OR in the AM

Pertinent Results:
[**2180-7-24**] Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. The inferoseptal and
inferior walls are dyskinetic. The anteroseptal and anterior
walls are severely hypokinetic. The anterolateral wall is mildly
to moderately hypokinetic. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= [**11-13**] %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic
aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Mild to
moderate ([**1-31**]+) eccentric aortic regurgitation is seen.

A bileaflet mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
motion of the mitral valve prosthetic leaflets appears normal.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.

Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of study.

  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2180-7-24**] where
the patient underwent Biventricular ICD Placement via left
thoracotomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support. Device was interrogated Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tube was
discontinued without complication.  Coumadin was started for his
mechanical mitral valve. He was bridged with heparin.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD five the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  He
refused the scheduled Keflex due to diarrhea, which resolved
after he stopped taking this medication.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt he had
sufficient Keflex up to that point and it was decided that he
would not be prescribed further antibiotics.  The patient was
discharged to home in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
