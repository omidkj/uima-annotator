HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

65-year-old woman who presents with left leg weakness.  The
patient was found to have a stenosis of the brachiocephalic
artery on an MRA/MRI.  MRI of the entire spine was obtained
by her PCP for suspicion of disc disease.  The rationale for
pursuing of an MRA is unknown.  She saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from
vascular surgery who referred her to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5730**].  He
performed an angiogram and confirmed the stenosis.  On [**9-14**],
a stent was placed but afterwards she developed flaccid left
hemiparesis of arm and leg.  She was taken back to angiography
where she had another stent placed for "another
blockage."  The radiology report of the angio states that
there was an apparent narrowing of the proximal common
carotid artery.  It was felt that the patient had developed a
flap distal to the site in the common carotid artery.  She
received three further stents of the carotid.  Afterwards,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5730**] states that her left sided weakness resolved.

After the second visit to the angio suite, the patient says
she developed a drop in hematocrit, requiring three units of
packed red blood cells.  She does not know if she had a
hematoma. Before discharge, the patient said she still had some
weakness which significantly improved but she also developed
left leg numbness while in the hospital which progressively
worsened after she was discharged.  She came to the Emergency
Department because the numbness has worsened to the point
where she felt the leg feels "dead".  She is walking without
support but she leans to the left and is not steady.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

1)  Restless leg syndrome
2)  Duodenal ulcer

Medications:
Coumadin-started after the stent
Plavix
Klonopin

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with two sons.
Independent in activities of daily living.  No tobacco or
ETOH.

On physical examination, blood pressure 140/70, heart rate 70
and regular.  The patient appeared comfortable.  OP clear,
right carotid bruit, no JVD, no thyromegaly.  Cardiac
examination was notable for a regular rate and rhythm.  Chest
was clear to auscultation, and abdomen was benign.  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema of the extremities.

On neurological examination,

Mental Status:  The patient was awake, alert, and oriented
times three.  The patient stated the months of the year
backwards and forwards.  Language testing demonstrated normal
naming of high and low frequency objects, good repetition.
Normal fluency and comprehension.  The patient could write a
sentence to dictation.

Memory:  Registered and recalled [**3-19**] objects at one and five
minutes.  Calculations were normal.  The patient could
demonstrate how to strike a match, light a cigarette, puff
it, throw it to the ground, and stamp it out.

CN:  Optic disks were normal.  PERRLA, EOMI, VFFTC, V1-V3
intact to light touch and to pinprick.  Face, tongue, palate,
SCM move symmetrically.  Hearing intact to finger rub
bilaterally.

Motor:  Normal tone and bulk.  No pronator drift.  No
asterixis.

Sensory:  LT and PP severely reduced on the left leg compared
to the right.  Poor JPS of the left toe.  There is no sensory
level.

Reflexes:

B, T, BR, patella, ankle Plantar
R 3 3 3 3 2 down
L 3 1 2 2 2 down

Coordination:  [**Last Name (LF) 43945**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], FFM were normal.  Romberg maneuver
was negative.

Gait:  She does lean to the left.

Labs:  INR 1.4

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  65-year-old woman who developed left
sided weakness and left common carotid artery stenosis found
to have common carotid artery dissection requiring further
stents.  On examination she has UMN weakness in the left leg with
concurrent sensory loss.  Given the clinical setting, the most
worrisome possibility is a stroke.  The vascular distribution
would be ACA territory (unusual compared to MCA).

If imaging is negative, then the second possibility is lumbar
disc disease, although the history is not consistent.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1)  MRI with DWI, MRA of the brain.  If stents are
prohibitive, then proceed with CT and CTA (of neck as well)
if renal function allows.

2)  If imaging negative, then we should consider imaging of
the L-spine.

3)  Her Coumadin needs to be continued and brought up above
2.0 given the dissection.
