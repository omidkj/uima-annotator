[**2107-6-15**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-13**], the
cardiac silhouette
remains at the upper limits of normal. The engorgement of
pulmonary vessels
seen previously is not appreciated and the pulmonary markings
are essentially
within normal limits. Mild atelectatic change is seen at the
bases with some
blunting of the costophrenic angles suggesting a small pleural
effusion.
