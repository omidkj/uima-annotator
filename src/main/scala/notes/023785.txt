Studies:
CT Head [**3-27**]: No acute intracranial pathology.
.
TTE [**3-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function with
impaired relaxation. Normal right ventricular systolic function.
Mild valvular thickening without pathologic
regurgitation/stenosis. Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 68 yo F with severe COPD, CHF, h/o PE presents
w/hyperkalemia, thrombocytopenia and respiratory failure.
.
#. Respiratory failure: The patient had a history of severe
COPD, steroid dependent, diagnosed with multilobar pneumonia
recently, with worsening pulmonary function. She was intubated
en route to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory distress. The emergency room
ABG was consistent with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The
patient also has a history of PEs however, per the CTA from the
outside hospital from which she was transferred, she had no PE.
She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including atypical
coverage, as well as high dose steroids.  Nasopharyngeal swab
was sent to rule out flu and was negative, however returned RSV
positive.  Given her immunosupression with chronic steroid use,
PCP was also [**Name Initial (PRE) **] concern. However, induced sputum was negative for
this.  Her respiratory failure was felt to be secondary to COPD,
RSV and bilateral superimposed pneumonia.  Her respiratory
status continued to worsen requiring increased levels of PEEP
and FiO2.  An esophageal balloon was placed to help titrate vent
settings.  She was continued on broad antibiotics and supportive
care for RSV.  Toward the end of her hospital course her chest
x-ray was concerning for an ARDS picture with worsening
bilateral infiltrates as well as volume overload which was not
amenable to diuresis given kidney failure and hypotension.  She
also required significant sedation due to underlying anxiety and
agitation which caused her to be asynchronous with the vent.
Given the patient's poor clinical status and poor prognosis, a
family meeting was held with the patient's daughter/HCP [**Name (NI) **].
The patient was made CMO in acordance with what the family felt
the patient's wished would be.
.
# Sepsis: The patient developed hypotension in the setting of
fever and keukopenia. Blood cultures grew out [**Female First Name (un) **] and
enterococcus. The source was unclear though line infection was
suspected. The patient was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics, including anti-fungals. The patient required
multiple pressors to maintain her blood pressure. As above, her
condition declined and she was made CMO.
.
# ARF: The patient had an elevated creatinine on admission that
resolved and then worsened in the setting of sepsis. Her sepsis
was treated as above.
.
#. Hyperkalemia: The patient had a potassium of 8.3 on
admission, most likely medicatioin related as not a hemolyzed
specimen. The patient's acute renal failure  was insignificant
compared to the level of hyperkalemia. Of note, the patient's
digoxin level was >3, which was felt to be the principle cause.
The patient received insulin, calcium cloride in the ED. She was
also given digibind to reverse the medicaiton's effect.  Her
potassium corrected and continued to remain in normal range.
Her digoxin was held the entire hospitalization.
.
# Anemia: At the end of her hospitalization, the patient
required transufusions for a hematocrit frop from 38 to 26. This
was concerning for a GI bleed. However, the patient was mad eCMO
and no further intervention was made.
.
#. FEN: The patient had tight glycemic control and was
temporarily on tube feeds.
.
#. PPX: The patient was placed on a ppi and pneumoboots
.
#. CODE: FULL, changed to CMO as above.
.
#. COMMUNICATION: With the patient's daughter/HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 36989**]
