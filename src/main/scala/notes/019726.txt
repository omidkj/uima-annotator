History of Present Illness:
   Patient is a 67 year old male with history of DM-II, CKD, MI,
CAD, CHF, A-fib, who was transferred from an OSH [**2182-12-27**] with
reported fluid overload. Pt was initially referred to OSH with
sxs of SOB, orthopnea, and DOE as well as a R thigh abscess at
donor saphenous graft site. US performed @ OSH showed 7cm fluid
collection in the right mid thigh, for which he was started on
Vancomycin and Zosyn ([**2182-12-26**]). At [**Hospital1 18**], abx regimen was
switched to Vancomycin/Levofloxacin/Flagyl ([**12-28**]). Vancomycin was
discontinued and levofloxacin switched to cipro on [**12-31**]. Pt was
on the vascular servive aduring this admission but was being
followed by cardiology and diuresed on the floor since [**12-28**] for
gross total body fluid overload. The patient decompensated early
am on the day of transfer with sats in the mid 80s, requiring
Dopamine gtt to maintain MAP > 65. The patient was initially
transferred to SICU on [**1-2**] for further diuresis, continuation of
Dopamine gtt, and commencement of BiPap. In the SICU, the
patient had worsening SOB and hypercapnia that was not
responding to diuresis. The patient was transferred to CCU for
management of above.

   In the CCU, the pt had worsening SOB, hypoxia, hypercapnia
that was not responding to diuresis so he was tried on bipap and
then intubated. Pt was switched from dopa to neo to levophed.
Initially diuresed to -3.3L, but didn't tolerated less PS
despite this. Now LOS ~even. Pt has had low-grade F (to 100.0)
from [**1-3**], then up to 102 on [**1-5**]. Pt was also given
inhaled NO x ~1 day with reported decrease in PA BPs, then
transitioned to Viagra.

   Upon transfer to MICU ([**1-6**]), pt denies pain. Continues to
require levophed for BP support. Tolerating PS mechanical
ventilation. CCU team gave pt 80 IV lasix today x1 for diuresis.

STUDIES PERTAINING TO RLE FLUID COLLECTION:
[**2183-1-5**]: Right Noninvasive LE ultrasound - repeat imaging
IMPRESSION: 1) Fluid collection tracking deep to the
subcutaneous tissues; significantly smaller but more organized
compared to the ultrasound of [**2182-12-30**]. Superficial to and
distinct from the bypass graft. No flow to suggest
pseudoaneurysm.
2) Subcutaneous tissue edema consistent with cellulitis.
.
[**2182-12-30**]: Right Noninvasive LE ultrasound
There is evidence of extensive subcutaneous infiltration and
induration
consistent with cellulitis.  In addition, there is a linear
tract extending from the superficial surface - corresponding to
the scar site that extends to a deeper collection that measures
a maximum of 7 x 2 cm.  This collection runs along the
undersurface of the thigh, but lies superficial to the patient's
graft site.  The graft is identified and is patent (see separate
report). The graft is separated from the superficial collection
by a distance of 1.3 cm. This superficial collection contains no
flow and is not thought to represent a pseudoaneurysm.

[**2183-1-5**]: CTA Chest: There is no CT evidence for pulmonary
embolism.  Specifically, the questionable filling defects seen
in the left lower lobe on the prior CT are now well opacified.
This pulmonary branches demonstrate normal enhancement without
filling defects.  There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions
and bibasilar atelectasis.  There is mild diffuse ground glass
opacities as well as septal thickening.  There is enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette with increase in size of both left and
right side [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].  In addition, there is mild enlargement of
the coronary sinus.  All these findings suggest congestive heart
failure.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Congestive heart failure with bibasilar atelectases and
moderate pleural effusions.
2.  No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
