Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Beat-to-beat variability on LVEF due
to irregular rhythm/premature beats.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent w
