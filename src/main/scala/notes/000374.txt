Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
R eyelid drooping, slurred speech, Code Stroke


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intraarterial TPA thrombolysis
Right vertebral artery stent placement


History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 57 year old with a history of Asthma, HTN,
Hyperlipidemia, tobacco abuse, who presents with eyelid drooping
and slurred speech.  Code Stroke called at 3:33, Neurology at
the bedside by 3:38.

Pt. reports that she was at work this afternoon at 1:55 when she
suddenly noticed that her right eyelid was drooping, and she had
trouble keeping her eye open.  Over the next 5-10 minutes her
symptoms progressed, and she also noticed that her left eye was
drooping and that the left side of her face was numb, like she'd
just gotten a novacaine shot there.  She noticed that her speech
was slurred.  She felt very dizzy, like the room was spinning.
She had double vision, which she thinks was vertical.  She told
her co-workers and they called EMS, and she was transported
here.

Since she arrived here she feels that her speech has gotten more
slurred, and that she has developed trouble swallowing, and
feels like she is gagging on her secretions.  She is not able to
open either eye enough to see.  She still feels dizzy.

On ROS she denies any recent fever, chills, or URI symptoms.
She has had some dysuria in the past few days.  She does not
remember any trauma to her head and neck.  She just got home
from a vacation on Saturday, and was lugging her baggage around
the airport, and had a 3 hour flight.  She denies any weakness
or numbness in her arms or legs.

Imaging
CTA Head and Neck with perfusion:
On the unenhanced scan, there is no evidence for acute ischemia
or hemorrhage.

On the CTP, there is no evidence for global perfusion defect in
the MCA territory.  Preliminary evaluation of the CTA images
demonstrate what appears to be occlusion of the distal basilar
artery extending to the proximal right PCA artery.  This area
also appears to be hyperdense on unenhanced CT.  No definite
acute infarction in the brainstem or cerebellum is seen,
although
MRI evaluation would be recommended for further evaluation.

There is a 4.5-mm right lung apical nodule for which recommend
correlation with dedicated chest CT.  The right distal vertebral
artery appears to taper to a thread and there is also a filling
defect in the V4 segment, suggesting of acute nonocclusive
thrombus.  In light of this finding, the filling defect in the
distal basilar artery could represent an acute clot from the
right distal vertebral artery dissection rather than basilar
artery thrombosis in the setting of atherosclerotic basilar
artery disease.

IMPRESSION:

Preliminary images highly concerning for distal basilar artery
thrombosis.  No definite acute infarction is seen in the
cerebellum or brainstem, but would recommend correlation with
MRI.

Repeat Head CT at 5:47:
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus.  There is a hyperdense appearance of the distal
basilar artery which correspond to the area of thrombosis seen
on
prior CTA. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Hyperdense
appearance to the distal basilar artery consistent with recently
diagnosed thrombosis.
TTE [**2185-9-20**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen  ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. The  estimated right atrial pressure is
5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,  cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%)
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with normal LV  diastolic function. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular  chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)  appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial  mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is  normal. There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-8-1**], no
change. No source of embolism identified.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2185-9-21**] 8:23 PM
MRI BRAIN: Areas of slow diffusion are seen in the pons right
greater than left, left superior cerebellum, and right
cerebellum. Also seen are infarcts in the left occipital lobe.
These correspond to areas of low diffusion coefficient on ADC
map, and probably represent acute infarction secondary to the
previous basilar thrombus. These findings are corroborated on
the FLAIR and T2 images. No other areas of cerebral infarction
are seen. Ventricles and sulci retain their normal caliber and
configuration. There is fluid in the sphenoid sinuses.

MR ANGIOGRAPHY HEAD: The basilar artery and posterior
circulation appear now patent. The internal carotid arteries,
Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and major branches also appear patent.
