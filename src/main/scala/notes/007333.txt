Admission Date:  [**2168-1-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-1-13**]

Date of Birth:   [**2137-10-10**]     Sex:  M

Service:  O-MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 30 year old
male with a past medical history of pulmonic stenosis (now
thought to be secondary to an anterior mediastinal mass), who
presented with five weeks of progressive nonproductive cough,
fever, and night sweats to an outside hospital on [**2168-1-1**],
where a chest x-ray revealed an anterior mediastinal mass and
a CAT scan showed the mass measuring at 11.3 by 14.4 by 12.0
centimeters, as well as small effusions.  The patient was
sent home with follow-up but over the weekend, he developed
pleuritic left sided chest pain with mild shortness of
breath. Again, he was evaluated at the outside hospital where
the pericardial effusion now appeared large.  He was
therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
where an echocardiogram revealed a 3.5 centimeter effusion
with inferior vena cava inspiratory collapse and mitral
inflow variability without increased jugular venous pressure
or a pulsus.  The patient was transferred to the CCU for
close monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hernia repair at eight years old.
2.  Lyme disease at ten years old.
3.  Pulmonic stenosis diagnosed in [**9-11**], after a murmur and
diagnosed by echocardiogram.
4.  Shingles.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  Negative tobacco.
Three drinks of alcohol per month.  The patient works as
industrial designer, physically active.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother passed seven years ago from breast
cancer.  Grandfather with prostate carcinoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature 101.8,
heart rate 105, blood pressure 130/70, respiratory rate 27 to
32, oxygen saturation 98% in room air.  The patient is a well
developed male who is thin and diaphoretic, anxious, in mild
respiratory distress.  The pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.   Extraocular movements
are intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  The
oropharynx is clear.  Negative anterior posterior
lymphadenopathy.  Neck is supple, negative axillary nodes.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart was
tachycardia, regular S1 and S2 with II to III/VI murmur at
the left sternal border.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities
were no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  No rashes.  Strength
was [**4-13**] in all four extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count was
10.9, hematocrit 37.2, platelet count 381,000.  INR 1.5.
Chem7 was within normal limits.

Echocardiogram revealed normal systolic function, 3.5
effusion at the largest diameter, inferior vena cava collapse
with inspiration, question of pericardial studding, mild
respiratory variation in mitral inflow consistent with some
early signs of tamponade.  CAT scan from [**2168-1-1**],
heterogeneous mass in the left midline compressing the left
pulmonary artery, right upper lobe pleural nodules, left
pleural effusion, pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pericardial effusion at admission - The patient had signs
for early tamponade physiology but was hemodynamically stable
and was admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.  Repeat
echocardiogram showed increasing size of the effusion.  The
patient therefore underwent pericardial drain and 600cc of
grossly hemorrhagic fluid were removed.  Following the
procedure overnight, there was no further drainage from the
pericardial drain.  Repeat echocardiogram showed decreasing
pericardial fluid.  Therefore on [**2168-1-8**], the pericardial
drain was pulled.  The patient had one further follow-up
echocardiogram on [**2168-1-11**].  This revealed no effusion and it
was felt the patient was stable from a cardiac standpoint.

2.  Hematology/Oncology - The patient underwent a mediastinal
biopsy to diagnose the large anterior mediastinal mass. The
biopsy revealed nonseminomatous germ cell yoke sac tumor.
The patient underwent two treatments of radiation therapy as
well as a round of five days of chemotherapy with Etoposide
and Cisplatin.  Staging workup included a head magnetic
resonance scan which revealed no lesions, as well as an
ultrasound of the scrotum which was within normal limits.
Fluid drained from the pericardial and pleural effusions were
negative for malignant cells.  The patient tolerated
chemotherapy well suffering from nausea, relieved by Ativan.
He was pretreated with Allopurinol and intravenous fluids to
prevent tumor lysis.  The patient completed his five days of
chemotherapy.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week
for continuation of his therapy with the possible addition of
Bleomycin following pulmonary function tests.

3.  Infection - During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he
continued to have shortness of breath as well as a cough with
mild hemoptysis.  On [**2168-1-7**], the patient spiked a fever.
This was thought most likely secondary to the tumor burden,
however, the patient was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin
and Clindamycin as broad spectrum therapy with a question of
postobstructive pneumonia.  Subsequently, the patient did
well with no further fevers.  Vancomycin and Clindamycin were
stopped and the patient will complete a ten day course of
Levofloxacin.

4.  Pleural effusion - The patient had a left sided chest
tube placed for drainage of pleural fluid. Following the
removal of the chest tube, the patient had continued drainage
from the site of the tube.  After a number of days, this
slowly resolved.  The patient's site was closed by CT surgery
with a suture.  The suture is to be removed in seven to ten
days at a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home with VNA services for
dressing changes.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up on [**2168-1-21**], with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], as well as [**2168-2-8**], with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] of
cardiology.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Ativan 0.5 to 1 mg p.o. q3-4hours p.r.n. nausea.
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. once daily times three days.
3.  Robitussin with Codeine p.r.n.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1,  Nonseminomatous germ cell anterior mediastinal tumor.
2.  Pericardial effusion, status post drainage.
3.  Left pleural effusion, status post drainage.
4.  Postobstructive pneumonia.
