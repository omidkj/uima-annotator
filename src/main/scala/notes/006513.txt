Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ureteral stent placement
Insertion and subsequent removal of central venous catheter
Insertion of peripherally inserted central catheter

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman w/ DM2 presented from nursing home. Found somnolent,
hypoxic to 70's this AM. Fever to 102. Hypoxemia improved to
90's on NRB. She was brought by EMS to the [**Hospital1 18**], where she was
found to have a UTI.  Had elevated lactate to 10.1. Initial ABG
of 7.23/32/47/14. Anion gap of 25. Also had acute renal failure
with creat of 1.8 (prior baseline 0.8). She was not intubated,
as she is documented as DNR/DNI. Subclavian TLC was placed under
sterile conditions.        BP 80's --> 110's after volume
resuscitation (nearly 6L in total). No vasopressors needed.
Urine and blood cultures were sent. CXR had no acute
infiltrates. Got empiric coverage with vanco/levo/flagyl.
.
Of note, she has recent history of diarrhea and abd distention.
In the ICU, she was not responsive to questions, but did open
her eyes to voice and tracked during the exam.
.
In the MICU, pt had stable EKG's after initial troponin leak.
Cardiac enzymes were trended after an initial troponin leak.
These trended down. Pt was diuresed b/c of question of fluid
overload contributing to hypoxia. Upon discharge from MICU, pt
was sating well on nasal cannula.

Imaging:
CXR ([**1-30**]): There is a right-sided central venous catheter with
distal tip in the proximal right atrium. Cardiac silhouette is
mildly prominent. There is tortuosity and calcification
throughout the aorta. There is no signs for overt pulmonary
edema. There is small bilateral pleural effusions. No focal
consolidation is seen.
.
CT abd/pelvis ([**1-30**]): 1.Mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter of
the left kidney secondary to the distal left ureteral stone.
Urgent urologic consultation is recommended if the patient has
signs of infection. 2.Possible thickening of the splenic flexure
of the colon and nearby fatty stranding and thickening of
Gerota's fascia are noted. All this appearance may be reactive
to the generalized anasarca,but ischemia is not excluded. The
study was severely limited due to lack of contrast.
.
CXR ([**2-3**]): Compared with 2/13, the patient is now considerably
rotated to her right. The left pleural effusion may not have
changed significantly, as there is a skinfold superimposing the
left lower lung field which may be accounting for the apparent
increased hazy density at that level. Given the obliquity, an
accurate comparison of the right pleural effusion is not
possible. There is now a patchy infiltrate in the left upper
lobe, consistent with aspiration or pneumonia.
.
CT head ([**2-5**]): 1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Moderately severe chronic microvascular infarction. 3.
Increased opacification of left mastoid air cells compared with
the prior study. Other paranasal sinus and right mastoid
findings as described.
.
ECHO ([**2-6**]): LV systolic function appears mildly to moderately
depressed. With mid to distal anteroseptal/apical akinesis. The
apical septum is aneurysmal. No definite thrombus visualized but
cannot exclude. The anterior wall is not well visualized. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The aortic valve is
not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion. No definite vegetation seen (cannot
exclude).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-6-14**],
the regional wall motion abnormality is new suggestive of
interim myocardial
infarction/ischemia. Mild aortic regurgitation is now seen.
.
EEG ([**2-7**]): This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence
of left
temporal slowing and sharp waves, indicative of both cortical
irritability and subcortical dysfunction. The slow and
disorganized
background with bursts of generalized slowing suggest a mild to
moderate
encephalopathy. No electrographic seizures were seen. Note is
made of an
irregular cardiac rhythm.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
