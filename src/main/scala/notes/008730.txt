Chief Complaint:
Thank you for consulting on this 68 year old male struck by a
vehicle on [**2123-11-12**]. Pt has GCS of 13 on the scene, 8 in the ED

occipital L frontal SAH, L temporal IPH, small R SDH, R
occipital/temporal bone fx, R rib fx [**4-3**] and small liver
lesions.

FINAL REPORT


INDICATION 68-year-old male with left subarachnoid hemorrhage
and continued
mental status changes. Evaluate for interval change.

TECHNIQUE: Serial axial CT images were obtained from the skull
base to the
vertex without intravenous contrast.

FINDINGS: Compared to the prior study of [**2123-11-18**], there
has been no
significant interval change in a large left temporal
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with area of associated edema. There is no evidence
of midline
shift or hydrocephalus. A small left subdural hematoma is again
identified,
unchanged. There is stable subarachnoid hemorrhage. No new areas
of acute
hemorrhage are identified. Previously seen bilateral scalp
hematomas are
unchanged. Opacification of the maxillary and paranasal sinuses
are again
identified. The osseous structures and multiple fractures are
unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain with no new areas of
hemorrhage or
mass effect.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

FINAL REPORT


INDICATIONS: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Assess for carotid
traumatic
injury.

Note, this study was initially interpreted on [**11-13**], but is
being
dictated on the 17th now that multiplanar reformatted images
have become
available.

TECHNIQUE: Volumetric CT imaging of the head was performed
before and
following the administration of 100 cc of Optiray contrast, per
CTA protocol.
Multiplanar reconstructions were made.

COMPARISON: Head CT from [**2123-11-12**].

CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The area of
parenchymal
hemorrhage in the left anterior temporal lobe is slightly
larger. There is a
questionable tiny right frontal subdural hematoma, and
questionable
parafalcine hematoma posteriorly, which is not significantly
changed since the
previous study. New subarachnoid blood is seen over multiple
sulci and in the
interpeduncular fossa. Possible evolving frontal contusions are
present. At
this time, there is no shift of normally midline structures.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white
matter differentiation remains preserved. There is no
hydrocephalus, and
basal cisterns are not effaced. There is no evidence of
intraventricular
hemorrhage.

CAROTID CT ANGIOGRAPHY: Evaluation of the proximal right common
carotid
artery is limited due to extensive beam hardening artifact from
dense contrast
within the right subclavian vein. The more distal right common,
external and
internal carotid artery are widely patent. Atherosclerotic
plaque is present
in both carotid bulbs, much more so on the right than on the
left. Both
vertebral arteries are patent. There is no evidence of cervical
carotid or
vertebral dissection. Both petrous carotid segments and portions
of the
carotid arteries within the carotid canal are unremarkable.
Supraclinoid
internal carotid arteries are normal. The middle cerebral
arteries and
anterior cerebral arteries are unremarkable. The anterior
communicating artery
is visualized and is normal in caliber. Both posterior
communicating arteries
are probably visualized. The right posterior communicating
artery is larger
than the left. Both posterior cerebral arteries are normal in
course and
caliber.

There is near complete opacification of the sphenoid sinus and a
large fluid
level within the right maxillary sinus and a right scalp
hematoma as described
on prior studies.

IMPRESSION:
1. Increasing amount of left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage.
Increasing
amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage. No hydrocephalus or
ventricular
effacement. Basal cisterns
