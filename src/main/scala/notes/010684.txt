Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for placement of biventricular automatic implantable
cardiac defibrillator

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-- s/p [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacemaker
-- s/p TEE with unsuccessful cardioversion
-- s/p placement of a Swan Ganz catherter


History of Present Illness:
73 yr old female with htn, hyperlipidemia, s/p mechanical AVR
w/single vessel CABG w/VG to OM '[**30**]. (s/p stenting of SVG to OM
[**2142-11-12**]). admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] (on [**2-7**]) w/decompensated CHF
(BNP > 5000) and ARF (Cr 3.6). She was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital after presenting to her PCP's office hypotensive 60/30,
w/o radial or carotid pulse.  She was also reported to have had
a self limited episode of diarrhea and decreased appetite PTP.
Fell at home 5 weeks prioor to presenation.  She has a
non-displaced left posterior rib fracture at 4th/6th and 7th.
Trop on admit was 1.9, ck 200's, MB's negative, dig = 2.9, INR =
7.4 . Also noted to be in new ARF (cr 3.6) which was worse than
her baseline of 2.1. At the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital she had several
episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular repsonse
which was broken with IV diltiazem. She also complained of
severe dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea, minimal PND, and some
LE edema for 1-2 weeks prior to hosp.  She denied any chest
pain.  She denies cough, fevers, chills,  but did report a
20-30lbs weight loss over the course of two months, and
occasionally loose stools. Patient states that her weight loss
was secondary to poor access to food.  Upon discharge from
hospital the pt had had a friend who was cooking meals for her.
Her friend was then admitted to hospital which made it difficult
for her to obtain meals.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is mildly dilated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is normal in
size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: The left ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are
normal.

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic
prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. The transaortic
gradient is
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild
mitral annular calcification. There is moderate thickening of
the mitral valve
chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
severely depressed.
3. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
prosthesis
leaflets appear to move normally. The transaortic gradient is
higher than
expected for this type of prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen.
5. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape
unavailable for
review) of [**2139-10-12**], there is no significant change.


Cath [**11-14**]- where she ruled in for an MI
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed severe single vessel native coronary artery disease.
The LMCA
had only mild, diffuse disease.  The LAD had a 50% proximal
lesion.  The
LCx was totally occluded at its origin.  The RCA had a distal
50%
lesion.
2.  Vein graft angiography revealed a 90% stenosis of the
SVG->OM graft.
3.  Resting hemodynamics revealed systemic hypertension.
4.  Left ventriculography was not performed because of the
patient's
elevated creatinine and mechanical valve.
5 .  Successful stenting of the SVG-OM was performed with
overlapping
3.0 x 15 mm, 3.0 x 18 mm, and 3.5 x 18 mm Zeta stents.

[**2144-2-14**] Placement of PA catheter.
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: PA catheter placement


PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right internal jugular vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge
pressure
catheter, advanced to the PCW position through a 8 French
introducing
sheath.  Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
