DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Upper gastrointestinal bleed status
post MICU transfer.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 12053**] Surgical Intensive Care Unit/Medical Intensive Care
Unit to Medicine floor.  For the complete MICU course, see
the MICU dictation by [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor First Name **].

This is a 55-year-old female status post aortic valve
replacement on [**2166-4-1**] and was admitted for upper
gastrointestinal bleed which has resolved since secondary to
erosive esophagitis and gastritis with clots which were found
on EGD on [**2166-4-13**] with ulcers initially admitted to the
SICU on [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] but has had intermittent pain since in
the SICU with echo findings consistent with small pericardial
effusion and transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] Floor to be evaluated
for this questionable effusion per Cardiothoracic Surgery.

There was no plan since once transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**]
to have any kind of procedure such as pericardiocentesis
done.

Had an echo done after the CT findings which had shown the
pericardial effusion, and echo findings showed small
pericardial effusion with no tamponade physiology.  Patient
had no widened pulses since admission and no obvious [**Doctor Last Name 22936**]
triad findings.  So, no hypotension, no jugular venous
distention, and no muffled heart sounds.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Status post aortic valve replacement.
4.  Outpatient.
5.  Depression.
6.  Back pain.
7.  Ejection fraction 60% with clean coronaries on last
catheterization.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin causes itch.
2.  Codeine causes hives.
3.  Aspirin causes gastrointestinal upset.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive cocaine use but quit six years ago.
Positive tobacco one pack per day times 30 years.  Occasional
ethanol use, two to three drinks per week.  Lives alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 q.d.
3.  Paxil.
4.  Vitamin C.
5.  Levaquin.
6.  Metered-dose inhaler.
7.  Lasix.
8.  Iron sulfate.
9.  Lipitor.
10. Alendronate.
11. Colace.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION ONCE TRANSFERRED FROM SICU:
Temperature 97.6, blood pressure 142/70, pulse 76,
respiratory 20, O2 sat 94% on room air.  Fingerstick 95.
Generally, in no acute distress; alert and oriented times
three.  HEENT:  Moist membrane mucosa.  No lymphadenopathy.
Supple neck.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with
very mild basilar rales bilaterally.  Cardiovascular/Chest:
Regular rate and rhythm; no murmurs; no gallops or rubs; has
a III/VI diastolic murmur best heard at left upper sternal
border; also on chest wall, has mid incision post sternotomy
which is dry and intact with no oozing.  Abdomen:  Bowel
sounds are present, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis.  Neuro:  Grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 13.5,
which is down from the 18.5, and 34 hematocrit, which has
been about 33, 298 platelets, MCV 90, INR 1.2, PTT 29.4,
sodium 143, potassium 3.5, chloride 112, bicarbonate 24, BUN
8, creatinine 0.7, glucose 86, calcium 7.4, phosphorous 3.0,
magnesium 1.8.  Gastrin pending.  Helicobacter pylori pending
at the time.

Echo results showed small pericardial effusion but no
tamponade physiology.

[**2166-4-14**] CT chest showed soft tissue density, mild
stranding, and anterior mediastinum.  It could be related to
surgical changes.  Tiny foci to gas within mediastinum three
weeks following sternotomy with large pericardial effusion,
bilateral pleural effusion, and compressive atelectasis with
right upper lobe pneumonia found on CT.

Since being admitted the patient has had the following
hospital course.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  Patient was followed with
hematocrits daily, and her hematocrit has stayed stable since
she has been admitted to this service for the past four days
and has stayed in 30s, between 32 to 34.  She was switched
over from intravenous Protonix to p.o. Protonix and continued
on that while on service without any problems.  Helicobacter
pylori results came back positive.  She was sent home with
Helicobacter pylori treatment.

2.  In terms of her chest pain, her chest pain was actually
rule out myocardial infarction while in the MICU and no
obvious cardiac etiology for the chest pain.  Most likely was
thought by Cardiothoracic Surgery to be most likely secondary
to her sternotomy and healing process.  She is getting pain
medication for the treatment of the chest pain and has had no
EKG changes since has been on service.

3.  The pericardial effusion to be followed up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 911**], her cardiologist, with whom she has an appointment,
and she has remained without any [**Doctor Last Name 22936**] triad while on the
floor, no widened pulses, and no obvious signs of tamponade
physiology. Blood pressure has remained stable.

4.  In terms of her coagulopathy that she has had in the ICU
that had resolved, there was no evidence of it while she was
here on the floor.

5.  In terms of her aortic valve replacement, given that it
is a bioprosthetic, there was no need for chronic
anticoagulation keeping her hematocrit greater than 30.

6.  Hypertension:  She was to be started on her beta
blockers, Lopressor 25 b.i.d., and holding her aspirin for
the time being, given that she has had this recent
gastrointestinal bleed.

7.  Her pneumonia on chest CT, although afebrile and no
leukocytosis, was treated with Levaquin and was to continue
on Levaquin but since being treated for Helicobacter pylori
when sent out, the Levaquin was stopped.

Tolerated diet.  Walked patient on the day of discharge;
satting well; climbing stairs; and walking without any
difficulties; no tachycardia while walking; ambulating
without any difficulties.

DISPOSITION:  To home with VNA service.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Was told to avoid all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, Advil, Ibuprofen, aspirin.  Okay to use Tylenol for
pain.
2.  If symptoms persist, worsen, or new symptoms arise, seek
medical care as soon as possible.
3.  Her gastrointestinal follow up was moved up by a few
weeks to be seen on [**2166-5-9**] in the [**Hospital **] Clinic, which
was listed on her sheet, and will be told at time of
discharge.
4.  Was also told to call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] have an appointment for next week.
5.  Other appointments as listed.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Multiple gastric and duodenal ulcers.
2.  Pneumonia on Levofloxacin started on [**2166-4-15**] which was
stopped since she is going to get her Helicobacter pylori
treatment.

MAJOR SURGICAL INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  EGD post MICU stay.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Told to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and
aspirin.
2.  Clarithromycin 500 mg p.o. q. 12 hours.
3.  Was initially holding on Amoxicillin, which was going to
check with Attending to see if, given that she has had an
itch with Penicillin, is it okay to actually keep on
Amoxicillin.  Most likely will be switched to another
alternate therapy for Helicobacter pylori before discharge.
4.  Pantoprazole b.i.d.
5.  Metoprolol 25 b.i.d.
6.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. 4 to 6 hours and
discuss continuation with primary care physician.
7.  Acetaminophen as needed.
