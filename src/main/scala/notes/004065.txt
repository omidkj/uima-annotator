of sx. EKG changes persisted (STE's in V2-V4) and pt was xferred

Brief Hospital Course:
a/p: 79 yo male, HTN, ESRD on HD, COPD, extensive smokeing hx
presented w/SSCP, c/w STEMI, taken to cath at [**Hospital1 18**] where
totally occluded prox LAD lesion was stented with DES, now chest
pain free, recovering in the CCU/step down unit.
.
1. CAD: As above pt is s/p STEMI, s/p cardiac cath with stenting
of his LAD.  Following his cardiac catheterization, the pt??????s
cardiac enzymes trended down. He was briefly placed on a nitro
drip for ? of cardiac chest pain vs. indigestion, but was
quickly weaned off the drip and remained chest pain free for the
remainder of his hospitalization. He was placed on aspirin,
plavix, lopressor, and a statin  post-stenting and continued on
these medications throughout his hospitalization. The pt was
also placede on coumadin for anti-coagulation.
.
2. Pump: Post MI the pt??????s echo showed overall left ventricular
systolic function depression with akinesis of the antero-septum,
anterior wall and apex. The remaining segements of his LV
appeared hypokinetic (basal lateral wall moves best). No masses
or thrombi were seen in the left ventricle. The pt was placed on
lisinopril for afterload reduction as well as being continued on
his HD.
.
3. Rhythm: Pt was monitored on telemetry throughout his
hospitalization. Post MI the pt remained largely in NSR with
occasional PVCs. However, post-MI he was  noted to have LAFB and
RBBB.  It was unclear whether this was his baseline or the
result of his MI. The pt did have an episode of Afib with RVR.
The pt was loaded with amiodarone. Initially he was planned to
receive amio 800 mg qd X1 week with a taper in the usual fashion
(400 qd X 1 wk, then 200 qd X1 week). However, given that this
was an isolated episode and that the pt  is no longer
experiencing Afib with RVR the pt??????s amiodarone will be decreased
to 200 mg, to be worked up further by his out-pt cardiologist.

4. h/o HTN: As above, the pt??????s blood pressure was
well-controlled on lopressor 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
5. COPD:  The pt was initially wheezing on exam. The pt was
started on his out-pt alb/atrovent nebs. Serially CXRs were
followed and demonstrated stable b/l pleural effusions.
Following the administration of his nebs he has been
asymptomatic.
.
6. ESRD on HD: The pt received dialysis on Tu/Th/Sat. His meds
were renally dosed.

7. Physical limitations: The pt has had continued difficulty
with transfers out of bed unless assisted. PT has recommended
[**Hospital 31940**] rehab. The pt has also had continued musculoskeletal
??????related right shoulder pain. The pt should receive continued PT
for this issue as well.
.
8. Cold L hand: The pt has been noted to have a transiently cold
and numb left hand. Angiography has revealed diminished flow in
his AV graft. Transplant team saw pt and feel that pt??????s hand is
viable and is stable.Per their recs, his sx are likely [**1-3**] to
fluid shifts related to HD??????this is a typical manifestation of
A-V grafts.  However, pt needs out-pt follow-up in one week for
further evaluation.

9. ? facial droop??????The pt??????s nursing staff was initially concerned
that the pt had a left facial droop. However, full neurologic
exam and head CT were normal.
..
9. FEN??????the pt was placed on a cardiac healthy/low NA diet during
hosp

10. ppx??????The pt was on ppi, bowel regimen, and coumadin during
hospi.

11. Code: full code. This status was  discussed with patient and
family.

12. Dispo: The pt is to be d/c??????d to [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay for [**Hospital 64052**]
rehabilitation. Physical therapy saw the pt and recommended
continued PT given his poor transfer/ambulatory status.
