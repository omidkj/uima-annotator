Admission Date:  [**2138-3-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-4-6**]

Date of Birth:  [**2060-5-11**]             Sex:   F

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Losartan / Lisinopril / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with biopsy


History of Present Illness:
77 yo female with a history of COPD and CHF who presents with
sob. Pt states that she has had sob for many months, and was in
fact hospitalized for this about one month ago.  After discharge
she felt better for a while but over the past few weeks has had
worsening sob.  She came to ED this morning because she felt
acute worsening while trying to sleep.  Denies CP, palpitations.
 No LE edema or PND, however she does find it more difficult to
breath with lying down and has been sleeping in a chair.
Additionally she has had a cough and nasal congestion but denies
post nasal drip, fever, or rhinnorhea.  She also denies GERD.
She had any episode of myocarditis with associated heart failure
in early [**2137**] but per a recent cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is normal.  In
reviewing the prior discharge summary, she also presented with
sob after c/o several days of nasal congestion, increasing
dyspnea. During this prior hospitalization she had a CTA which
showed extensive emphesematous changes.  At that hospitalization
it was felt that she had a COPD flare triggered by viral URI.
During her hospitalization she had an allergic reaction to [**Last Name (un) **],
was discharged off all afterload reducing agents. Only medicine
change since discharge was discontinuing her HCTZ yesterday on
advisement of her cardiologist b/c she appeared dehydrated.  Of
note pt had a cardiac cath in [**5-21**] with no flow limiting
lesions. As past of work up for dyspnea she was seen in
pulmonary clinic this past week.  Pulmonologist felt that dypnea
was in part due to COPD but that her COPD could not account for
all of her DOE. Cardiac MR on [**2138-3-25**] with LVEF 62%, but
effective forward EF 54%, no evidence of scarring or infarction,
RVEF nl at 60%; mild MR.

Past Medical History:
COPD
CHF
osteoarthritis
hyperlipidemia
HTN
migraine headaches
possible chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (dxed during this
admission)

Social History:
Pt. has a previous 40 pack-year history of smoking (stopped 25
yrs ago).  She does not drink alcohol and denies other drug use.
 She lives with her husband and has three grown children.


Family History:
[**Name (NI) 1094**] mother's side notable for "extensive" heart disease
(several of her family members died from this); pt's father died
of "cancer of the spleen."  No history of diabetes or stroke.


Physical Exam:
VS:  T 97  BP 126/70  P 80  R 14 94% on RA
Appearance:  NAD
HEENT:  NC/AT.  PERRL, EOMI.  MMM, no sinus tenderness
Neck: supple, no LAD.
Chest: decreased air movement, exp wheezes on left > right, no
rales or rhonchi; coughs after taking deep breath
CV:  Nl rate.  Nl S1/S2, no murmurs.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, +BS, no HSM.
Ext: WWP, no edema; DP and radial pulses palpable bilaterally.

Neuro:  CN II-XII grossly intact.  2+ biceps and Achilles'
reflexes.  5/5 strength proximal/distal flexion and extension at

upper and lower extremities.  No finger-to-nose dysmetria and no

asterixis.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: 1.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] dep in v5-v6 (old EKG w/ 1 mm depressions)
.
CXR: no pneumonia, no pulmonary edema
.
Transbronchial biopsy:
a). Bronchial mucosa with chronic inflammation and increased
number of eosinophils. No alveolar tissue present.
b). No granulomas or vasculitis seen
c). No malignancy identified.
.
PFTs [**2138-3-4**]:
Mild obstructive ventilatory defect. The reduced diffusing
capacity
suggests an emphysematous process.  There are no prior studies
for comparison:
FEV1 and vital capacity to be 1.07 and 2.20 (65% and 90%
predicted).  FEV1 to vital capacity ratio is 49% (72%
predicted).  TLC and RV are normal at
98% and 106% of predicted, and DLCO is mildly reduced at 63%
predicted with DL divided by alveolar volume equal to 78%
predicted.  These PFT's compare well to those from [**Hospital1 9487**] from [**2137-8-16**] when FEV1 and vital capacity were
1.98 and 1.92 respectively, increasing to 1.03 and 2.12 after
Albuterol, though she had to take an Advair previously.  During
that set of pulmonary function tests she walked for 3 minutes
without
significant desaturation or complaints of shortness of breath,
though HR increased to 120.
.
CT chest [**3-24**]:
1. New areas of atelectasis or consolidation in the left lower
lobe, lingula and right middle lobe, probably related to the
increased bronchial wall thickening in the right middle lobe
suggesting active airways inflammatory disease. Infection in the
areas of consolidation, particularly in the left lower and right
middle lobes cannot be excluded, and neither can noninfectious
causes of pneumonia due to parasitic infestation or idiopathic
causes such as chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.
2. Severe emphysema.
3. Coronary atherosclerosis. No cardiomegaly or pericardial
effusion.
4. Mild interval mediastinal lymph node enlargement, probably
reactive.
.
CT chest [**2-21**]:
No PE on CTA.  There are extensive emphysematous changes in the
lungs, particularly in the upper lung zones.  There are tiny,
3-millimeter peripheral lung nodules unchanged from the prior
study as well as some nonpathologically enlarged mediastinal
lymph nodes and some calcified granulomas. Previous CT scans
also showed no evidence of interstitial
disease, CHF or pleural disease.
.
TTE [**1-20**]:
EF cannot accurately be assessed. Moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis, trace AR, 1+MR, mild PASP, compared to
prior study of [**2137-7-5**], left ventricular systolic function has
improved and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
.
Cardiac MRI [**3-24**]:
1. Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size with normal
regional left
ventricular systolic function. The LVEF was normal at 62%. The
effective
forward LVEF was mildly depressed at 54%. No MR evidence of
prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and function. The RVEF
was normal at 60%.
3. Mild miltral regurgitation.
4. The diameters of the ascending aorta and aortic arch were
normal. The
diameter of the descending aorta was mildly increased. The main
pulmonary
artery diameter was normal.
5. Mild biatrial enlargement
