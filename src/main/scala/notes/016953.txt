History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 16408**] is a 57yo F with depression and osteopenia who
presented to the ED with HA and fever. She started gfeeling
poorly on Monday with a sore throat. On Tuesday and Wednesday,
she began to feel more SOB, like her asthma was flaring, and a
cough developed. She has been using her albuterol 3xs/day with
no relief. The cough is wet but non-productive. Diffuse body
aches also developed. Fever and HA developed today. The HA is
similar to her prior migraines, associated with mild
photophobia. Of note, her daughter and grandchildren may have
been sick with something similar recently.

In the ED, initial VS were: T 102.5, HR 115, BP 117/74, RR 24,
sat 95% 3L NC. She was noted to be tachycardic and dry-appearing
in the ED. Initially BP was in the 110s, but decreased to the
80s during her ED course. CXR showed LLL PNA. She was given 1g
CTX and 500mg azithro to cover for CAP. Due to hypotension, R IJ
CVL was placed, and she got a total of 4L IVF. She was started
on norepi prior to transfer. While in the ED, she was also given
acetaminophen, Zofran, KCl repletion (40mEq po), and morphine
IV.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: T 100.4, HR 117, BP 125/73
on 0.14mcg levophed, 93% RA

Imaging:
[**9-30**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.

[**9-30**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe and lingular pneumonia with
background
interstitial edema.

[**10-3**] CTA Chest

IMPRESSION:
1.  Pulmonary hypertension, but no evidence of acute or chronic
pulmonary
emboli.
2.  Residual, multifocal edema or pulmonary hemorrhage.
3.  Left lower lobe pneumonia or segmental atelectasis.
Segmental and
subsegmental bronchial lumens occluded by debris, not by mass.
Lymph node enlargement restricted to the contralateral (right)
hilus and paratracheal mediastinal stations.
4.  Small, non-serous pericardial effusion.  No evidence of
cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis.

Bronchoscopy
Airways were visualized to the sub-segmental level bilaterally.
There were no endobronchial lesions. Airways were patent. The
mucosa was normal. LLL had retained mucus noted on inspection.
Edematous airway that are easily collapsable. No active signs of
bleeding or airway irregularities noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
57yo F with depression, asthma, and osteopenia who p/w fever,
HA, and cough found to be septic in the ED with LLL PNA on CXR
and history of antecendent ILI.

# PNA, septic shock: Met SIRS criteria with fever, tachycardia,
and leukopenia with pressor requirement in ICU,  Bacterial PNA
as presumed source of her sepsis. Given Hx and sick contacts,
her illness likely began as a viral influenza-like illness, and
she appears to have developed a super-imposed PNA. No recent
hospitalizations or other healthcare exposures, so CAP treatment
is appropirate. Vancomycin also added given hypotension and
potential for MRSA superinfection with influenza. Pt began to
have Sx > 72 hours PTA, so no role for Tamiflu. Patient was
volume rescusitated, started on norepinephrine, and admitted to
ICU.  Norepinephrine weaned off, and she remained
hemodynamically stable.  CTX/azithro/vanc was started for CAP
and MRSA coverage. Sputum Cx, blood culture, urine legionella,
viral swabs for flu, paraflu, adenovirus were negative. Patient
was started on fluticasone inhaler in place of home budesonide
(nonformulary). She was also started on standing ipratroprium
nebs, albuterol PRN, and morphine PRN dyspnea/pleuritic CP. She
had hemoptysis for several days after admission, so the
pulmonary team saw her in consultation. They performed a
bronchoscopy that was unremarkable, and sent bronchoscopy
brushings that are pending. She received 8 days of antibiotics
for pneumonia and felt better, ending on [**10-7**].  She also
received a 5d burst of steroids from some wheezes and pleuritis.
 On discharge she was able to breathe comfortably on room air
and had no evidence of wheezes.

#Hemoptysis: Probable cause include pneumonia.  In the ICU she
had one episode of hemoptysis.  Bronchoscopy unremarkable.
Negative rheum studies including [**Doctor First Name **], anca, anti-gbm, negative
BAL micro studies.  Has a history of pulmonic stenosis which may
be contributing feature to hemoptysis.  TTE done on [**10-9**] showed
normal EF and RV function with moderate PS, mild PR.
Pulmonology recommends outpatient f/u with potential RHC in the
future.

Cytology from BAL showed atypical cells with the following path
report:
Bronchial lavage:

  ATYPICAL.

  Many crowded groups of very atypical epithelial cells
  in a background of macrophages - highly reactive type II
  pneumonia versus well-differentiated adenocarcinoma.
  Clinical correlation is recommended.

Given active pneumonia it was felt that adenocarcinoma was
unlikely.  I communicated with her pulmonologist to confirm this
assessment and ensure she does not need further BAL or biopsy.

# HA: Per pt, pain is c/w prior migraine HA, which could have
been brought on by illness. CT head in ED negative. Received
supportive care with a combination of tylenol, nsaids, and
oxycodone.  No focal neurological findings and no meningismus.
Pain control moderate on discharge, but patient advised to try
and limit opiate use to prevent rebound headache.

# GERD: Home PPI was continued. Sucralfate was added.

#She had periods of sinus tachycardia with HR in the 100s, at
times wiht palpitations.  I communicated with her PCP who said
clinic HR values were in the 100s before.  PE was not felt to
cause this as she had negative CTA chest during ICU stay and no
further hypoxia with treatment of pneumonia
