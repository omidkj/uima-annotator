.
CXR [**2155-4-24**] (1am): Perihilar vascular congestion, bilateral
pleural effusions consistent with pulmonary edema. There is
likely adjacent bibasilar atelectasis, though areas of
aspiration and/or consolidation at the lung bases is not
excluded. Repeat radiographs following appropriate diuresis is
recommended to assess for underlying infection.
.
CXR [**2155-4-24**] (7am): Marked improvement up to almost complete
resolution of pulmonary edema.  Decreased but still present
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2155-4-24**]:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
severely dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
profoundly depressed (ejection fraction [**10-11**] percent): the
entire posterior and lateral walls are thin and fibrotic; the
entire posterior wall is aneurysmal and dyskinetic; the inferior
free wall is severely hypokinetic; the rest of the left
ventricle is at least moderately hypokinetic. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo F with h/o 3 vessel CAD, s/p stent to LCX in [**2154-12-23**],
ischemic cardiomyopathy, CHF with h/o cardiogenic [**Year (4 digits) **], severe
MR, atrial fibrillation who presents with SOB felt to be
secondary to CHF exacerbation.
.
1. SOB/CHF: Most likely etiology is CHF exacerbation. Last [**Year (4 digits) **]
in [**1-29**] showed LVEF 20-30%.  Unclear if she may have had small
NSTEMI with trop of 0.39 or if this is from the CHF. She was
slightly volume overloaded on exam and CXR was consistant with
pulmonary edema.  Unclear what precipitated her decompensation.
She was given 100mg IV lasix in the ED and responded well to
this with 1L urine output.  She was initially continued on 80mg
IV lasix daily and reached her goal of negative 1L/24hour
period.  She was then put back on her outpatient dose of 100mg
PO lasix and given boluses IV as needed to maintain a negative
fluid status.  Patient was initially placed on dopamine for
hypotension following nitro in ED.  This was weaned off while in
the CCU and her BP remained stable.  It is recommended to
restart HF regimen of ACEI when BP tolerates and renal function
returned to baseline. Unclear why she was not on HF betablocker
but presumably because of blood pressure drops. Aldactone should
also be considered in the future once this episode has fully
resolved.  A [**Date Range **] was performed that showed an interval worsening
of her systolic failure with LVEF 10-20% and thin and fibrotic
posterior and lateral walls. The patient has a scheduled follow
up appointment at the heart failure clinic.
.
2. CAD: Patient was started on heparin gtt given possibility of
NSTEMI. She refused cath and has known 3VD. She was continued on
medical management with ASA, plavix. It should be considered to
add a betablocker if BP allows. Her statin was held because of
h/o elevated LFTs.
.
3. Rhythm: H/O PAF. Continued amiodarone. It was felt that she
was not a good candidate for anticoagulation given her poor
compliance.
.
4. Schitzoid: Continued Mirtazapine, haldol
.
5. Elevated WBC: Was found to have a UTI. Pt was started on
bactrim, to be taken for one more day after discharge. Urine
culture was pending on discharge.
.
6. ARF: Likely secondary to poor perfusion from CHF. Avoided
nephrotoxins, held ACEI. Cr of 1.5 on discharge. Complete
resolution should be followed up after discharge.
.
7. Iron def anemia: procrit was held because of increased
hematocrit from baseline.
.
8. FEN: Low salt, heart healthy
.
9. PPX: SQ heparin, PPI
.
10. Access: PIV
.
11. Code: DNR/DNI
