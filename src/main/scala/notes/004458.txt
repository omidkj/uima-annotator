CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. [**Known lastname 59444**] is a 73 year old male who
was catheterized at [**Hospital3 **] in [**2124-5-30**] following a
non-Q wave myocardial infarction and recommended for coronary
artery bypass grafting that was refused at that time.  He is
now being recommended for primary angioplasty.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 73 year old diabetic male
living at [**Location (un) 582**] [**Hospital3 400**] since [**2124-5-30**] was
treated for congestive heart failure at [**Hospital6 **], treated with diuretics and discharged back to
[**Location (un) 582**], recommended for primary angioplasty as opposed to
coronary artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease,
anemia, glaucoma, psychosis, anxiety, depression and
cerebellar ataxia.  Patient states an allergy to penicillin
which causes a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include Lasix 80 daily, Ativan 1 q
6 hours PRN, aspirin 650 q 4 hours PRN, trazodone 50 at
bedtime, PRN, Zestril 40 daily, Zocor 80 daily, aspirin 81
daily, Cosopt 1 drop each eye B.I.D, Alphagan 1 drop in the
right eye B.I.D, Lopressor 75 B.I.D, Remeron 30 at bedtime,
Seroquel 100 daily,  Senokot 2 tablets at bedtime,
nitroglycerine 1 inch to chest wall q 6 hours, cianopramine q
month, Protonix 40 daily, Norvasc 10 daily, Glyburide 5 q
A.M., Clonidine 0.1 q. A.M., buspirone 10 daily, Plavix 75
daily

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Disabled, retired, single, factory worker
living in [**Hospital3 **] facility.  Legal guardian is his
sister, [**Name (NI) **], whose phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 59445**].
Patient denies cigarette or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Height 5 feet 4 inches, weight 171
pounds.  Neurologically alert and oriented.  Affect is
somewhat slow.  Neck is supple, jugular venous distension to
9.  No bruits.  Lung examination with bibasilar crackles.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm with a I/VI systolic
ejection murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities are warm and well perfused with palpable
posterior tibial pulses.  No varicosities.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 5.9, hematocrit 40.8, platelets
205.  Sodium 143, potassium 4.6, chloride 104, CO2 30, BUN
22, creatinine 1.1, glucose 161.  Echocardiogram done in [**2124-5-30**]:  Left ventricular hypertrophy with mild left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, trace aortic insufficiency
with pulmonary hypertension, ejection fraction of 45 to 50
percent.  Cardiac catheterization also done in [**2124-5-30**]
showed normal left main, left anterior descending coronary
artery with 70 to 95 percent lesions, circumflex totally
occluded and 70 percent right coronary artery.

Patient was admitted to cardiology service and brought to the
catheterization laboratory on the day of admission for
assessment of his coronary artery disease given his recent
episode of congestive heart failure.  Catheterization showed
an ejection fraction of 60 percent with a proximal left
anterior descending coronary artery 90 percent occluded and
three vessel disease.  They were unable to perform
angioplasty at that time and he was referred for coronary
artery bypass grafting.  The patient was followed by the
cardiology service until the [**6-14**] when he was
brought to the operating room.  Please see the operating room
report for full details.  In summary, he had coronary artery
bypass grafting times four with a left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery,
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal, saphenous vein
graft to right coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to
the ramus.  Bypass time was 90 minutes and the crossclamp
time was 70 minutes.  He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer the patient was
atrial paced at 80 beats per minute with a mean arterial
pressure of 85 and a PAD of 16.  He had Neo-Synephrine at 0.3
mcg per kilogram per minute, insulin at 2 units per hour and
propofol at 20 mcg per kilogram per minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
However, he remained somnolent and therefore remained
intubated throughout the evening of his operative day.  On
postoperative day one the patient was weaned from vasoactive
medications.  He was weaned from the ventilator and
successfully extubated.  Following extubation his Swan Ganz
catheter was removed and he was begun was on oral medications
include beta blockers as well as diuretics.  On postoperative
day two the patient continued to be hemodynamically stable.
His chest tubes were removed and he was transferred to the
floor for continuing postoperative care and continuing
cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next several days the
patient had an uneventful postoperative course.  His activity
level was advanced with the assistance of the nursing staff
as well as physical therapy and on postoperative day five it
was decided that the patient was stable and ready to be
transferred to a rehabilitation facility.

At the time of this dictation the patient's physical
examination is as follows:  Temperature 99, heart rate 72,
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 114/70, respiratory rate 18, O2
saturation 98 percent on room air.  Weight preoperatively
77.9 kilograms, at discharge 86.5 kilograms.  Neurologic:
Alert and oriented, responsive.  Respiratory clear to
auscultation although somewhat diminished in the bases.
Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Sternum is stable.
Incision with Steri-Strips, open to air, clean and dry
without drainage or erythema.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities
are warm and well perfused with trace edema.  Left endoscopic
Hava site incision with Steri-Strips open to air, clean and
dry.  Upper thigh is ecchymotic.  It should be noted that the
patient complained of visual as well as auditory
hallucinations following the administration of narcotics.
Upon discontinuation of narcotics the hallucinations
resolved.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.  He is to be discharged to
[**Location (un) 47**] Transitional Care Unit following which he will
return to [**Location (un) 582**] [**Hospital3 400**].

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
   bypass grafting times four.
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Congestive heart failure.
5. Hypercholesterolemia.
6. Anemia.
7. Glaucoma.
8. Anxiety/depression/psychosis.

Patient is to have follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**] in two to
three weeks and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks.

Plavix 75 mg daily times three months, mirtazepine 30 mg at
bedtime, Alphagan 1 drop in the right eye B.I.D, Cosopt 1
drop in each eye B.I.D, cryptopine 100 mg daily, trazodone 50
