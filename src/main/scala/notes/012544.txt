Admission Date:  [**2136-6-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2136-6-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2059-11-21**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2121**], status post ICD placement in
[**2131**] for V-fib arrest.  Patient was doing well until two days
prior to admission when he noted fevers up to 101.5
associated with chills and rigors.  He noted a dry cough.
There was no chest pain, blurry vision, headache, abdominal
pain.  He did have some nausea and vomiting x1, nonbloody,
nonbilious.  Patient denies any sick contacts, travel,
camping, new foods, or raw foods.

Patient had an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  In the office
he was found to be febrile with systolic blood pressure at
90.  Laboratories were drawn.  The patient was sent to the
Emergency Department and admission.  In the Emergency
Department the patient was noted to be afebrile with blood
pressure of 76/46, pulse of 84, O2 saturation of 99% on room
air.  The patient received 500 cc of normal saline and his
blood pressure rebounded to 115/60.

The patient was admitted to the Medicine floor.  Two days
after being admitted, the patient was still febrile up to
101.1.  He was in the bathroom when he started feeling dizzy
and faint.  Telemetry showed that the patient was tachycardic
up to about 180 beats per minute.  Patient noted respiratory
distress, but no chest pain.  His ICD fired four times.
Patient's blood pressure remained stable during this episode
as well as his oxygen saturation.  Patient was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit for further workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post IMI and coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2121**].
2. Status post V-fib arrest and ICD placement in [**2131**].

troponin 4.4.

Electrocardiogram:  Sinus tachycardia, left bundle branch
block, prolonged P-R, no change from prior.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 74-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease, status post IMI in [**2121**]
with CABG, status post AICD placement in [**2131**] for V-fib,
admitted for fever workup initially.  Two days into his
admission, patient noted to be tachycardic up to 170-180
beats per minute, hemodynamically stable, AICD shocked x4.
Patient admitted to CCU for further observation.

1. Rhythm:  When patient was admitted to the CCU, pacer was
interrogated.  It appears that the patient actually received
six shocks.  Most of the shocks actually for a
supraventricular tachycardia.  It appears that the patient
had at least one episode of actual ventricular tachycardia.
It was likely induced by a supraventricular tachycardia.
This supraventricular tachycardia was likely a flutter given
the rate of 150.  Because the patient's amiodarone had been
discontinued due to ophthalmic side-effects, he was started
on dofetilide.  The patient was started at 500 mg po bid,
checking Q-T intervals before each dose.  After several
doses, the patient was noted to have a prolonged Q-T interval
up to 700 milliseconds.  Patient also was having frequent
polymorphic V-tach on the monitor, but not frequent enough to
initiate a shock from AICD.

On [**2136-6-19**], the patient also was noted to have lost his
pulse in the context of a bradyarrhythmia.  This was
transient lasting only several seconds.  Patient's one lead
VVI pacer kicked in at a rate of 40.  Patient otherwise
remained hemodynamically stable.  Patient's dofetilide dose
was held.

On [**2136-6-21**], the patient went for EP study.  A small focus of
A-flutter was located and was ablated.  It was unclear how
clinically significant this was.  Because the patient was not
having anymore tachyarrhythmias off of the dofetilide, there
was no further interventional procedures.  No atrial lead
placement occurred as it would require a new pacer generator
and would likely be done in conjunction with the placement of
a [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer in the near future.

Following the ablation, the patient was visited by his
ophthalmologist.  He commented it was probably safe to
restart amiodarone given that the patient's loss of vision in
one eye was likely ischemic in nature and not secondary to
amiodarone.  Patient was started on amiodarone 200 mg po tid.
Toward the latter end of his admission, patient was noted to
be slightly bradycardic and V paced at 50 beats per minute.
For this reason, the amiodarone was decreased to 200 mg po
bid.  Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**].

2. Coronary artery disease:  Patient has known coronary
artery disease.  He did have a troponin leak, but his CK
peaked at 790 and his MB index remained flat.  His troponin
leak was likely secondary to receiving AICD shocks.  It was
important to rule out that the patient's tachyarrhythmia was
not secondary to ischemia.  The patient received a Persantine
MIBI.  This showed no reversible perfusion defects.  There
was a severe fixed perfusion defect involving the basilar
portion of the lateral wall and the basilar portion of the
inferior wall in addition to a mild fixed perfusion defect at
the apex.  The LV ejection fraction was calculated at 18%.
Patient was kept on beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, in addition
to aspirin and Lipitor.

3. Pump:  Initially, the patient was noted to be in slight
congestive heart failure.  He received 40 mg of IV Lasix with
good diuresis.  He had no further active failure.  As already
noted, the patient had an ejection fraction of 18% per his
stress test.  Patient received a metabolic stress test to
determine his qualification for [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer.  Patient at this
time does not meet the qualification for a [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer given
his oxygen consumption that was calculated.

Patient was seen by the Heart Failure team.  [**Hospital **]
medical regimen was optimized for his congestive heart
failure.  Patient was started on ACE inhibitor and his
lisinopril was titrated up to 20 mg po q day.  He was also
started on digoxin with an initial digoxin load.  The patient
was also started on aldactone 12.5 mg po q day.  Finally, the
patient's beta blocker was titrated up.  He was changed from
atenolol to Toprol given its proven efficacy in congestive
heart failure patient.  As already noted, the patient became
bradycardic towards the
