History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 year old man with history of CHF who was intially
admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital with atrial fibrillation and CHF
exacerabtion and is now transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. History was obtained from patient and medical
records since the patient could not address many aspects of his
presentation.

On [**2128-10-7**] he presented to his PCP with shortness of breath
and weight gain. At the time his weight was 251 lb (aproximately
25 lb increase) and he was noted to have worsened lower
extremity edema. On this visit he was also noted to be in atrial
fibrilation with a ventricular rate of 130 bpm (most recent ECG
in [**12/2124**] is reported as sinus). At that time he was on
diltiazem 240 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg daily and lisinorpil 20
mg daily. His furosemide was increased to 40 mg twice daily and
he was started on metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily. For unclear
reasons his lisinopril was discontinued.

On [**2128-10-14**] he presented to his PCPs office again with symptoms
of shortness of breath and was found to have atrial fibrillation
with a rate of 150. He was refered for admission at [**Hospital **]
Hospital. There he was initially treated with diltiazem,
metoprolol, digoxin and heparin ggt. ACS was ruled out with
cardiac enzymes and ECG. He was also given intravenous
furosemide boluses for management of his CHF exacerabtion.

On [**2128-10-16**] he desaturated and he developed rapid ventricular
response. A code was called without CPR administration. The
patient was transfered to the ICU. He was intubated and placed
on furosemide ggt. He was started on digoxin and his diltiazem
ggt was continued. Acetazolamide was also started. He was
extubated on [**2128-10-25**] and he has done well on 4L NC since then
(02 sat 98%). His [**Location (un) **] admission weight was 279 lb, which
improved to 250 lb with diuresis. A TTE on [**2128-10-16**] showed EF55%
with septal hypokinesis as well as severe MR (with limited
windows). Repeat TTE on [**2128-10-20**] confirmed severe MR with two
separate jets tracking up. LENIs were negative bilaterally. His
urine output ranged from 100 to 300 ml/hr??. His hospitalization
course at [**Location (un) **] has been complicated by delirium with
disorientation and combativeness. He developed hypokalemia in
the setting of diuresis and although sputum cultures grew GNR (?
E. Coli) he has been afebrile without CXR changes suggesting
PNA.
.
On arrival to the CCU, he reported only intermittent cough that
is non-productive and buttock pain at the site of his sacral
ulcerations. He denied shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, chills. He is a poor historian and
could not comment further on prior history.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR - [**11-2**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-31**], there is little
overall
change. Continued moderate cardiomegaly with mild engorgement of
pulmonary
vessels.
Progressive clearing of the left basilar atelectasis and
effusion. Elevation
of the right hemidiaphragm persists with atelectatic streaks in
the right
lower zone.

ECHO: [**10-28**]:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. There is partial
mitral leaflet flail. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of
severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Atrial fibrillation: Apparently new onset since [**2128-10-14**],
however his most recent ECG prior to this was in [**2119**]. Also pt
is a poor historian. This was likely precipited by his CHF
exacerbation.  After a TEE revealed no clot, he was DC
cardioverted.  He was rhythm control with an amiodarone load and
rate controlled with metoprolol.  He was anticoagulated with
heparin gtt (CHADS 2, note unclear h/o CVA), and once he was
determined not to be a current surgical candidate bridging with
warfarin was undertaken.  Titrate to INR 2.0 - 3.0.
.
Decompensated diastolic/systolic LV dysfunction: On presentation
at OSH, nearly euvolemic here. The exact etiology of the
exacerbation was not known. The most concerning precipitant is
worsening mitral regurgitation, although may be precipitated by
dietary or medication noncompliance or gut edema and poor
absorbtion. TTE showed preserved systolic function.  Given his
severe MR there is a component of systolic dysfunction as well
given his EF<60. No baseline TTE was available to determine
progression of his LV dysfunction.  His weight decreased by aprx
30 lb with furosemide gtt, and he was stabilized on his diuresis
regimen with furosemide 60mg po QD. Afterload reduction with a
goal SBP<120 was acheived with BB and ACEI (lisinopril). There
was some element of Co2 retention with sedation, normalized now.
