Allergies:
Clindamycin / Zemplar / Levofloxacin / Trazodone / Doxycycline

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, line infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR placement on tunelled HD line on [**3-16**]


History of Present Illness:
43F with ESRD on HD, DM1, CAD s/p CABG, h/o poor access with
failed AV fistulas presenting with pus coming from HD line.
Systolic BPs to 80s, patient appeared sick and was not mentating
well.  Lactate was 3.0.  Therefore peripheral dopamine started
(patient did not want central line).  She did not have arterial
line.  On arrival on the floor hypotensive to sbp of 84, but
talkative, mentating.  says baseline BP is in 110s.  Given that
patient does not have dialysis access, she was not given IVF.
Pressure has now improved to mid-90s systolic.
  Of note, patient admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**12/2144**] for tunelled line
infection.  the line was removed and replaced at that time.  A
TTE did not show evidence of endocarditis at that time.  A TEE
was attempted but not completed because of patient intolerance.
  She denies known exposure to line site to cause infection.
She wonders about sterility of dressings at her outpatient HD
center.
  Upon arrival at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was febrile to 101.5,
later peaking at 102.6.  Central line considered but patient
refused.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD s/p CABG x 3 in [**10-27**]
2. DM1 since age of 6
3. ESRD on HD, being worked up for transplant
4. h/o MRSA rt stump infection
5. anemia
6. PVD s/p TMA

8. Bell's Palsy (right side, s/p valtrex x 7 days, last [**1-2**])
9. AAA repair in '[**39**]
10. h/o previous tunelled line infection.

Skin: Multiple excoriations and scabbed over lesions on arms

Pertinent Results:
CXR on admission:
FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of a large bore
dual-lumen dialysis catheter with the distal tip projecting over
the right atrium. Prominence of the [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1106**] pedicle is again
identified with mild cephalization. This is relatively stable.
No overt edema is noted. There is no consolidation. Lung volumes
are low. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, but stable.
Clips and median sternotomy wires are consistent with prior
CABG. No effusion or pneumothorax is evident. The bones are
diffusely osteopenic. The patient has had prior cholecystectomy.

IMPRESSION: Interval placement of a dialysis catheter. Stable
findings otherwise with no definite superimposed acute process.
.
HD line placement:
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
tunneled dialysis catheter placement via the left internal
jugular venous approach.

[**Month/Day/Year **] (4/34): prelim
The left atrium is elongated. The left atrium is dilated. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis and thinning of the entire inferior wall and
hypokinesis of the remaining segments. Diastolic function could
not be assessed. The remaining left ventricular segments are
hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetation seen. Mild mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation. Severe regional and moderate global LV systolic
dysfunction.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-12-25**], the
pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly elevated. The
other findings are similar.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

Brief Hospital Course:
#MRSA Sepsis
Patient has history of line sepsis previously with MRSA.  Source
of sepsis unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] had a TTE to evaluate valves which
was of suboptimal quality but did not show large vegetations.
Plan is for two weeks of treatment with vancomycin starting on
[**3-12**].  If, after two week course of treatment, patient has
persistent bacteremia, she should be considered for TEE.
.
#Hypotension
when hypotensive on admission, patient was not mentating well
and had elevated lactate.  Hypotensive on the floor to mid-80s
systolic however patient was mentating well.  On discharge BP
116-128/64-72.  She required peripheral dopamine in the ICU.
.
#ESRD on HD
Patient was without HD between [**3-11**] and [**3-16**].  She did not have
uremic signs or symptoms except for some non-specific itching.
We continued nephrocaps, Cinacalcet, and calcium carbonate.  She
may have a high-protein diet while on HD.

# DM I
Continued outpatient Insulin regimen of 12 units NPH qAM.
fasting blood glucose in AM was elevated, however given multiple
periods of being NPO, her regimen was not adjusted.  This may be
titrated at rehab.
.
# Diarrhea
Patient had 36hrs of diarrhea and was C.diff negative x3.
Diarrhea resolved with imodium.  She was afebrile and had
minimal abdominal pain.
.
# Skin breakdown
Patient was admitted with skin breakdown felt to be from
prolonged imobilization.  She was treated with therapeutic
boots, air mattress, and skin care.  She refused air mattress
after an explanation of the risks and benefits including
development of pressure ulcers.
