Chief Complaint:
Mild dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mitral Valve Repair (#34 CE Physio Ring), PFO Closure, Maze
[**2195-6-18**]


History of Present Illness:
56 year old female with known heart murmur who developed
palpitations this past winter. She was found to have paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation and was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80724**] for
evaluation. Anticoagulation was started with coumadin. Initial
echocardiogram suggested significant mitral regurgitation. A
transesophageal echocardiogram was then obtained which revealed
moderate to severe mitral valve regurgitation and prolapse with
severe left atrial enlargement. Over the past month, she reports
progressive dyspnea on exertion and PND.  Given the severity of
her disease, she has been referred for surgical evaluation for a
mitral valve repair vs. replacement with a MAZE procedure. She
admits today for Heparin bridge with plans for OR in the AM.

Pertinent Results:
TEE [**2195-6-18**]
Conclusions
Prebypass

The left atrium is dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial
septal defect is present. There is mild LVH. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. There is moderate/severe bileaflet leaflet mitral
valve prolapse. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2195-6-18**] at
1330.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine. Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral position. It
appears well seated and there is no mitral regurgitation. Mean
gradient across the mitral valve is 3 mm Hg. LVEF= 45%. Aorta is
intact post decannulation. Rest of examination is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2195-6-18**] where
the patient underwent Mitral Valve Repair, PFO Closure, Maze
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
Thrombocytopenia developed and coumadin was held.  Platelet
count rose and Coumadin was resumed.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Pacing
wires were discontinued. When chest tubes were placed to
waterseal, she developed moderate bilateral pneumothoraces.
Tubes were placed back to suction and progressed more slowly.
Eventually Chest tubes were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.
