Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin / Heparin Agents / Morphine / Tylenol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension at HD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71 F with DM, cirrhosis [**3-7**] NASH and acetaminophen toxicity, h/o
gastric angioectasia (GAVE/watermelon stomach) with GIB, ESRD on
HD MWF, diastolic CHF, HIT, seizure dx on [**Month/Day (2) 13401**], admitted on
[**1-11**] to the ICU for low hematocrit and hypotension. She went to
HD on [**1-11**] where she was found to be hypotensive in the 70's and
80's systolic. Of note, ED documentation indicates that she may
have received the wrong antihypertensive prior to dialysis.
Patient does not recall what medications she may have received,
and only vaguely recalls the events surrounding her dialysis.

She had a recent hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 40795**] for fall
complicated by tib/fib fracture, altered mental status (with
contributions from UTI, hepatic encephalopathy, and hypercapnea
from narcotic use), ESBL enterobacter UTI, and heme positive
stools.

In the ED, her BP was 86/p, HR 70, RR 16, Sat 100%RA. She was
given 1L fluid, one unit of packed red cells, and platelets. She
was guaiac positive. Blood cultures were drawn and stool was
sent for C-diff. Inferior ST changes were concerning for ongoing
ischemia, and she was transferred to the MICU.

In ICU, patient was given 2 unit PRBC's and 1 unit of platelets.
 Her BP improved thereafter and Hct stabilized.  She was then
transferred to the floor for management.

Past Medical History:
Recent history includes multiple admissions in [**5-7**], and
[**9-10**] for confusion in the setting of lactulose noncompliance,
and in [**12-11**] for hypotension. In [**5-11**], she was diagnosed with
GIB from gastric angioectasias/watermelon stomach. She was also
found to have a portal vein thrombosis on ultrasound but was not
anticoagulated for h/o GAVE, GIB, HIT.

OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Portal vein thrombosis [**5-11**] but not anticoagulated for h/o
GAVE, GIB, HIT
- Type 2 diabetes.
- End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis M/W/F
- Cirrhosis [**3-7**] NASH and acetaminophen toxicity.
- Gastric angioectasia with h/o GI bleeding in 4/[**2177**].
- Diastolic CHF. EF>55% by echocardiogram in 7/[**2176**]. She has a
prlonged mitral deceleration time and moderate MR.
- ?right sided pleural effusion: diagnosed on U/S [**11/2176**], CXR
showed a small effusion - stayed stable in subsequent imaging.
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, Ab+ in 1/[**2176**].
- History of seizure disorder, on [**Year (4 digits) 13401**].
- History of infection in the left knee.
- History of MRSA and Clostridium difficile.
- History of gram-positive rod bacteremia in 4/[**2177**].
- Status post ORIF of the left distal femur fracture 12/[**2175**].

Social History:

[**Location (un) **]. Her daughter is involved in her care. The patient
currently denies alcohol use, tobacco use, and illicit
drugs.

Family History:
Noncontributory.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo h/o gastric angioectasia (GAVE/watermelon stomach) with
chronic GIB, type 2 diabetes, ESRD on HD (MWF), diastolic CHF,
HIT, seizure dx on [**Month/Year (2) 13401**], admitted with hypotension and anemia
in setting of chronic GIB and polymicrobial (proteus,
enterococcus, coag neg staph) cultures from PICC line and AV
fistula.

#) BACTEREMIA:
Patient w/baseline low blood pressures in 80s/90s likely [**3-7**]
ESLD and generalized low systemic vascular resistence. Cortisol
stim from [**1-20**]: 10.1->15.6. Patient also with PICC cultures
growing pansensitive ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS and coag negative
staph [**1-12**], CORYNEBACTERIUM SPECIES [**1-13**], PROTEUS MIRABILIS
[**1-14**], and GNRs [**1-14**], [**1-16**], and VANC resistant ENTEROCOCCUS
FAECIUM. Surveillance cultures since [**1-17**] has NGTD until
[**Female First Name (un) **] on [**1-25**]. CT scan without clear abdominal source. Other
source could be GI fistula (no fluid collection per US). TTE
negative for vegetations and no TEE obtained as pt was not a
surgical candidate given comorbidities.  Antibiotics were
planned for full four week course.  ID followed her during her
stay, and in the days preceeding her death, she was on a four
drug pathogen-specific regimen. Despite these treatments, Ms.
[**Known lastname 32662**] continued to have progressively poor hemodynamic stabily,
until, despite pressors, her blood pressure declined causing
cardiopulmonary arrest.

#) Hypotension: Likely [**3-7**] to sepsis and low SVR due to ESLD.
Required pressor support throughout her stay.  Many family
discussion were held, and, given her poor prognosis, it was
decided that pressor support would not be escalated.  Thus,
despite these treatments, Ms. [**Known lastname 32662**] continued to have
progressively poor hemodynamic stabily, until, despite pressors,
her blood pressure declined causing cardiopulmonary arrest.

#) Cirrhosis secondary to NASH/acetaminophen. Hepatologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Liver disease was end-stage upon admission. Total Bili
and INR were monitor and continued to increase during her stay.
Associated illnesses included coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia,
hypotension and chronic GI bleed. Per Liver consult obtained
while inpatient, she was not a transplant candidate.  She was
continued on rifaximin, ursodiol, and lactulose.  Nadolol was
held given hypotension.
.
#) Anemia/GI bleed. Has known chronic GI bleed from GAVE as well
as insufficient erythropoeitin in setting of ESRD. Transfused
for Hct less than 21.

#) Thrombocytopenia. Chronic, most likely from splenomegaly and
ESLD with poor thrombopoetin levels. Also has h/o HIT so heparin
products were avoided. Transfused for platelets of < 10K for
spontaneous bleed.

#) ESRD on HD. Upon admission was requiring dialysis three times
weekly, but becamed too hypotensive to tolerate HD. Per Renal,
CVVH would be the next step, but this is not indicated given
patient's continued hypotension and poor prognosis.

#) Type 2 Diabetes: Well controlled while inpatient with insulin
sliding scale and QID glucose monitoring.

#) Diastolic CHF. Extravascular hypervolemia but continued to
need pressor support to maintain adequate blood pressure.  Thus,
diuretics were held while inpatient.

#) Seizure disorder. No observed seizures while in patient.
Continued on [**Last Name (STitle) 13401**] at home dose.

#) s/p L tib-fib fracture: First noted [**2177-12-17**] upon follow-up
appointment with orthopedics s/p ORIF. Admitted with external
brace. Orthopedics followied while inpatient and determined no
additio
