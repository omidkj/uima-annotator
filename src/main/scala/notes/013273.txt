Admission Date:  [**2188-2-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2188-2-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2125-1-20**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old male with
a history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, tobacco use,
sleep apnea, and known AS/AI who had cardiac cath ten
years prior and had mild to moderate coronary artery disease
per the patient's recollection.

Thursday prior to admission, he was walking outside to clear
snow and had a questionable syncopal episode.  He found
himself lying on his back on the floor.  The fall was not
witnessed.  He believes he had loss of consciousness for a
few seconds.  As a result of the fall, he sustained a
laceration to the back of the head.  He refused to go to the
hospital at that time.  He denied slurred speech or visual
changes, weakness or confusion following the event.

The next morning, the patient awoke with severe dyspnea and
diaphoresis.  He presented to the Emergency Department where
he underwent VQ scan to rule out PE which resulted in low
probability.  The patient was treated with Prednisone and
inhalers for presumed asthma and sent home.

He came for follow-up to his doctor's the day prior to
admission where the patient became acutely short of breath
with diaphoresis with midsternal and nonradiating chest pain
and nausea.  He presented to the Emergency Department where
he was treated with Nitroglycerin sublingual times three,
Lasix 40 mg IV, and oxygen.  He diuresed 1200 cc with
improvement in his symptoms.  He was ruled out for myocardial
infarction.

The patient had a 14 lb weight gain over the previous month
with no change in diet.  He denied lower extremity edema.
He has  chest tightness in the past with
significant exertion.  He denied any prior myocardial
infarction.

ETT from [**2187-12-12**] showed no chest pain.  This was stopped
due to fatigue.  He had mild to moderate shortness of breath.
He had nonspecific ST changes.

Echocardiogram done that same day showed no wall motion
abnormality, ejection fraction of 60%, borderline left
ventricular hypertrophy, [**12-13**]+ mitral regurgitation, and [**1-14**]+
aortic insufficiency, moderate aortic stenosis.  The patient
was transferred for cardiac catheterization to rule out
coronary artery disease and evaluated mitral valve and aortic
valve.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Aortic stenosis.  Hypertension.
Hypercholesterolemia.  Passive alcohol use.  Sleep apnea.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Obesity.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Tonsillectomy.  Uvuloplasty for sleep
apnea six weeks prior to admission.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., started at an outside
hospital, Aspirin 162 mg p.o. q.d., Captopril 12.5 mg p.o.
t.i.d., also started at the outside hospital, Lipitor 40 mg
p.o. q.d., Zoloft 25 mg p.o. q.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 35%, hemoglobin 9.6, platelet
count 334, white count 9.4; electrolytes were within normal
limits with a creatinine of 1.5; INR 0.9; CK peak was 162,
troponin negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Deferred.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought directly to the
lab.  The patient was found to have aortic stenosis, mild 1+
aortic insufficiency, elevated wedge pressure, pulmonary
artery hypertension, likely multifactorial, mitral
regurgitation, ejection fraction of 60% with normal end
diastolic volume, trace mitral regurgitation, right dominant
system,  large OM and atrial
branch at AV groove, a lesion in a circumflex branch and a
small right coronary artery with total mid occlusion.

The patient underwent aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm
mosaic porcine valve and coronary artery bypass grafting
times two with saphenous vein graft to OM and saphenous vein
graft to right coronary artery.  The patient tolerated the
procedure without complications.

He was extubated on postoperative day #1.  He continued to do
well.  The patient had an uneventful hospital course.  By
postoperative day #4, the patient was able to ambulate well,
was tolerating a regular diet, and had good p.o. pain
control.  He was felt to be ready for discharge to home with
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks and with his primary
care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 39360**] in [**12-13**] weeks, and with his
cardiologist in [**1-14**] weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d., Lasix 20 mg
b.i.d. x 7, Atorvastatin 40 mg q.d., Captopril 12.5 mg
t.i.d., Percocet [**12-13**] tab p.o. q.4-6 hours p.r.n., Potassium
Chloride 20 mEq b.i.d. x 7, Ibuprofen 400 mg q.6 hours
p.r.n., Tylenol 650 mg q.4 hours p.r.n., Aspirin 325 mg q.d.,
Zantac 150 mg b.i.d., Colace 100 mg b.i.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post aortic valve replacement,
coronary artery bypass grafting times two.
