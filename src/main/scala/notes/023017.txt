History of Present Illness:
72M with a history of VF arrest s/p AICD placement in [**2102**],
Afib, DM, COPD, CHF, and HTN found down in his bedroom today
after unknown down time, last seen 24 hours prior.

In the ED, vitals were 98.6, 72, 121/71, 24, 97% RA, patient was
given 4mg Morphine for rib pain, had a preliminarily negative
head CT, c-spine CT, negative pelvis x-ray and unchanged CXR and
was sent to the floor.

Upon questioning on the floor, patient was somnolent, closing
his eyes throughout the exam and unable to focus his attention.
He did not recall any events leading up to his fall, although is
able to state that he lives alone and is able to care for
himself. He is AAOx2.5 (he thought he was in [**Hospital3 **]). He denies any prodrome to the events, and states that
he was in his normal state of health prior to this morning when
he "fell out of bed."

We administered 0.8mg of naloxone to try to rouse the patient,
and this had no effect, with the patient stating that he was
still in no pain, but was tired and unable to keep his eyes
open.

We were able to get in contact with the Partners [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 25174**] and spoke with the on call night nurse, [**Doctor First Name **], who
read from a chart that the patient had been seen on [**2115-6-19**] and
was able to dress and shower without assistance, although he was
incontinent of stool and had dyspnea on exertion.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2115-7-5**]):
      Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an
abbreviated
      workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates
recovered from
      this site.
      ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES.    RARE GROWTH.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
