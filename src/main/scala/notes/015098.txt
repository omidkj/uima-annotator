CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cardiac arrest and unresponsiveness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year old man
with no cardiac history who had flu like symptoms for several
days and was at [**Location (un) **] on [**2191-8-22**], to purchase over
the counter medicines.  The staff there observed that he
appeared sick.  He had a syncopal episode and by-standers
initiated CPR.  It is unclear how long he was down.

When the EMTs arrived, he was asystolic.  He was intubated
and given Epinephrine.  He was in pulseless electrical arrest
which converted to sinus rhythm after five minutes.  He was
brought to [**Hospital3 **] where he was unresponsive and head
CT was negative for bleed.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
[**2191-8-22**], for cardiac catheterization which showed clean
coronary arteries with ejection fraction of 41%; cardiac
echocardiogram [**2191-8-23**], showed ejection fraction greater
than 55%.  It is not clear why he had a cardiac arrest given
his lack of coronary artery disease on cardiac
catheterization.

He was started on Levofloxacin/Vancomycin/Flagyl given that
he had high cardiac output on Swan and there was concern for
sepsis.  Antibiotics were switched to Levofloxacin and Flagyl
after respiratory culture showed H. influenzae on [**2191-8-26**].

Since his arrival at [**Hospital1 69**], he
remained unresponsive not only to voice but also to pain.
The neurology service evaluated him and he essentially has no
hope of meaningful recovery.

On [**2191-8-26**], lumbar puncture showed no evidence of central
nervous system infection. All sedation (Propofol) was stopped
on [**2191-8-28**].  The patient received electroencephalogram which
showed encephalopathy but no evidence of seizure.

Respiratory culture [**2191-8-23**], grew out H. influenzae and his
symptoms prior to his cardiac event, his fatigue, were
presumably due to pneumonia.  Chest x-ray did show evidence
of atypical pneumonia.

The patient was intubated on his arrival to [**Hospital1 346**].  He was extubated on [**2191-9-1**].

The patient had postpyloric gastric tube placed on [**2191-9-1**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Bipolar disorder.  The patient was
hospitalized for depression nine years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day.
2.  Risperidone 1 mg q.h.s.
3.  Aspirin.
4.  Robitussin.
5.  TheraFlu.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He was living with his wife at home.  A
retired small business owner, office sales.  Smoker 1.5 pack
per day, 75 pack year total.  Remote history of alcohol
abuse, quit twenty-five years ago.  He has three children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On [**2191-9-2**], temperature maximum was
101, current temperature 100.6, heart rate 55 to 77, blood
pressure 110 to 147 over 61 to 65, respiratory rate 17 to 25,
oxygen saturation 94% on 40% face mask.  In general, the
patient is lying in bed breathing comfortably but
occasionally irregularly, not responsive to voice or pain.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - The left
pupil is reactive 5.0 to 2.0 millimeter, right pupil
minimally reactive 5.0 to 4.0 millimeters, doll's eyes
intact.  Chest is clear to auscultation anteriorly, but the
patient is not able to follow commands to take deep breath.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2,
no murmur.  The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities no edema.  Neurologic -
no response to voice, no response to painful stimuli, neither
sternal rub nor pinching of any of his extremities, 2+
reflexes in upper and lower extremities.  Occasional small
nonpurposeful movements of extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Much of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course is
dictated in the history of present illness.  Briefly the
patient is a 67 year old man who suffered severe anoxic brain
injury secondary to cardiac arrest. Unfortunately, the
patient did not experience any neurologic recovery during his
nearly two weeks in the hospital.

Given his lack of hope for meaningful recovery, the patient's
family elected that he be comfort measures only.  He was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Medicine
service on [**2191-9-2**].  Morphine drip was started as needed for
the patient's comfort and the patient expired on [**2191-9-3**].

DISCHARGE (DEATH) DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cardiac arrest.
2.  Anoxic brain injury.
3.  Respiratory failure.
