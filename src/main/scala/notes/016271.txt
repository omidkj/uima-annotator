Blood cultures: No growth x24 hours

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:85 year old male with h/o lung cancer
presenting with increased weakness x2 weeks and noted to be
anemic on recent outpatient labs. Patient is DNR/DNI and states
does not want invasive management.

# Anemia: Likely slow GI bleed given no history of BRBPR or
melena, HCT dropped from 41.3 in [**2119-5-14**] to 24.1. GI evaluated
and determined no cause for emergent endoscopy. On further
discussion with patient and family, patient not interested in
endoscopic evaluation or treatment of potential bleeding source.
Patient does consent to trial of blood transfusion for
palliation of symptomatic anemia and received 2 units PRBCs.
Hematocrit increased 24.1-->27.8, although this repeat
hematocrit was drawn before completion of the second unit
transfusion. IVF were held since the patient was euvolemic.

# Shortness of breath: Likely combination of anemia, pleural
effusions, and CHF. Patient and family met with palliative care
and decided not to pursue any interventions or further workup.
Lasix dose was halved, and prescribed morphine, Ativan, and
atropine drops for comfort.

# Elevated Troponin: Patient without symptoms of myocardial
ischemia, normal CK and CK-MB, and no acute ischemia on ECG.
Most likely represents demand ischemia from tachycardia vs false
positive due to renal insufficiency. Troponin trended 0.32 to
0.35, CK-MB remained wnl. Patient not currently interested in
percutaneous coronary intervention if that were to become
indicated.

# Hyponatremia: Likely due to intravascular volume depletion,
improved 124-->130 with volume resuscitation with PRBCs.

# A-fib: patient with prior history of A-fib with RVR, takes
metoprolol for rate control. Metoprolol held in setting of
possible GI bleed, restarted once Hct stabilized.

# Pleural effusion: patient with chronic right pleural effusions
s/p pleurex placement. Undergoes weekly drainage of fluid from
pleurex catheter.  No interventions made.

# Lung Cancer: patient has stated he does not desire treatment
for his lung cancer and has opted for comfort measures only.

# CHF: Lasix held in setting of potential intravascular
depletion, discharged home on half dose.

# CAD: Aspirin held in setting of GI bleed.
