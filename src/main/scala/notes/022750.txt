Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
64yoM with h/o CAD, hemochromatosis, pulmonary fibrosis on
chronic steroids and intermittent home oxygen, transferred from
OSH with sepsis and pneumonia. Patient initially presented to
[**Hospital3 **] ED [**2162-3-6**] with complaint of fever to 103 and
rigors. Prior to that he had been ill for about a month with
productive cough and congestion. Initial vitals included T
103.9, BP 98/56. In the ED, SBP dropped from 90s to 70s. He was
bolused 1L NS and started on dopamine by peripheral iv. His
urinalysis was consistent with infection, and he received doses
of levofloxacin and vancomycin to cover UTI and possibility of
pneumonia given h/o pulmonary fibrosis. He was also treated with
hydrocortisone 100mg iv Q8hr given h/o chronic steroid use and
risk of adrenal insufficiency. An abdominal u/s was performed to
evaluate for ascites and revealed a cirrhotic liver,
splenomegaly, and ascites.
.
In the MICU, the dopamine drip was weaned off and pt's blood
pressure remained stable. His stress dose steroids were also
weaned once he was off pressors. Vancomycin was stopped and
levaquin was continued for pneumonia. Hematology was consulted
given his pancytpoenia. An ECHO was done to evaluate for
cardiomyopathy given pt's hx of hemochromatosis.
.
This morning, he states that he feels much improved. He endorses
only some sore throat which he attributes to oxygen. On review
of systems, he states that he has had a 37 lb weight loss over
the last six months coincident with tapering of his prednisone.
He denies any recent headache, vision changes, chest pain,
palpitations, orthopnea, PND, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, BRBPR, melana, arthralgias or skin
rash.

IMAGING:
[**2162-3-8**] CXR: 1. Interstitial opacity within the left lower lobe
is concerning for pneumonia. 2. Left upper lung opacity appears
more prominent than on prior exam, likley related to technique.
If clinically indicated, chest CT could be recommended for
further evaluation.
.
[**2162-3-9**] ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4469**] is a 64 year old male with a PMH significant for CAD,
hemachromatosis and pulmonary fibrosis (on chronic prednisone
therapy) who was transferred from an OSH with sepsis.
.
Given presentation and history, the patient was thought to have
sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He was initially treated with
broad spectrum antibiotics, stress-dose steroids, IVF and
pressors. He was eventually weaned from pressors and remained
hemodynamically stable. He was transitioned to levofloxacin to
complete a 10 day course of antibiotics. Steroids were tapered
to his home dose for pulmonary fibrosis.
.
The patient was pancytopenic on admission. His platelet count
had dropped from 99 to 61, WBC 8.6 to 3.2 and Hct 32 to 27 at
the OSH. A peripheral smear, iron studies and B12/folate were
unremarkable. Hematology was consulted and felt that the anemia
was due to chronic phlebotomy for hemochromatosis. Leukopenia
may have been secondary to infection given that it dropped
suddenly in setting of sepsis. Thrombocytopenia was likely due
to chronic liver disease and sepsis. HIT was not likely given
that patient has chronic thrombocytopenia and the platelet count
did not drop to [**2-9**] of what is was originally. The patient takes
Arava for psoriatic arthritis. This was held given the concern
for immunosuppresion. It may be restarted as an outpatient as
indicated.
.
Aspirin and statin were continued for CAD. Beta-blocker and [**Last Name (un) **]
were initially held and restarted when he was weaned from
pressors and deemed hemodynamically stable.
.
Of note, a lung nodule was identified on PA and lateral CXR.
Outpatient chest CT was recommended for follow up. In addition,
his INR was elevated and may be related to impaired synthetic
function of the liver given a history of hemachromatosis and
cirrhosis. Outpatient GI follow up was recommended.
.
Inhalers were continued for asthma. Lasix and spironolactone
were restarted for cirrhosis when the patient stabilized.
Atorvastatin was continued per home regimen.
