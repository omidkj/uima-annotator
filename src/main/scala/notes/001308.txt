Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**]
Chief Complaint:
Right flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Invasive ventilation


History of Present Illness:
69 y/o male with CAD s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation s/p BIV pacer
and on warfarin, CHF (EF >55% in [**2188**]), DM type 2, p/w acute
onset of right flank pain this morning. Pain intermittently
radiates to groin. Reports increased abdominal pressure and
weight gain of eight lbs in recent weeks, and also endorses
headache and dyspnea on exertion (cannot climb single flight of
stairs without having to stop). Denies trauma, hematuria,
dysuria, dark stools, constipation, chest pain, palpitations,
fevers or chills. Reports history of kidney stone many years
ago.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.6 60 150/61 18 94% RA. Abdominal
CT revealed markedly abnormal R kidney with evidence of
renal/perirenal hemorrhage.  Patient was seen by Urology, who
recommended medical admission for reversal of INR, pain control,
and serial Hct checks and repeat CT in two days. Patient was
given morphine & dilaudid with good analgesic effect.
.
On the floor, patient appears comfortable, but requesting
further pain medications

CT: CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post
median sternotomy with right atrial and left ventricular pacing
leads as well as right ventricular AICD lead; these are
incompletely visualized on the current study. There are new
moderate right and tiny left pleural effusions with adjacent
relaxation atelectasis. No nodules seen in the visualized lung
bases.

Assessment of the solid organs is limited due to lack of IV
contrast
administration. The non-enhanced liver demonstrates a tiny 5-mm
hypodensity along the left dome of the liver (2:10), too small
to accurately characterize. No gallbladder is seen probably due
to prior surgical removal. The nonenhancing spleen, pancreas,
adrenal glands, left kidney, and the non-opacified stomach and
small bowel appear unremarkable. Again note is made of extensive
colonic diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.

There is very abnormal appearance to the right kidney which is
expanded and demonstrates heterogeneous appearance with multiple
densities. Areas of high density likely represent subcapsular
and intraparenchymal acute hemorrhage.  It is difficult to
discern the kidney margin, however, note is made that previously
seen indeterminate 12 mm lesion which is partially exophytic
arising from the upper pole of the right kidney currently
measures approximately 22 mm (300B:47) and is separate from the
current hemorrhagic process. There is also extracapsular
extension of the hemorrhage from the lower pole of the right
kidney into the perinephric space which is expanded and causes
mass effect on the adjacent IVC and duodenum. No nephrolithiasis
and no definite hydronephrosis is noted.

The abdominal aorta contains mural calcifications as well as
mural
calcifications along the origin of the major abdominal arteries,
without
aneurysmal dilatation. No lymph node enlargement is seen meeting
size
criteria for adenopathy.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, prostate,
seminal
vesicles, and rectum appear unremarkable on this non-enhanced
study. There is sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of
diverticulitis. There are
bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias. No pelvic fluid, free
air, or
adenopathy is noted.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are noted along the
visualized
thoracolumbar spine, particularly noted at the L2-3 and L5-S1
levels which
causes some narrowing of the spinal canal. No region of bony
destruction is seen concerning for malignancy. Degenerative
changes are also noted at the sacroiliac joints and the hips.

IMPRESSIONS:
1. Markedly abnormal right kidney, with likely subcapsular and
intraparenchymal acute hemorrhage. There is marked heterogeneous
appearance to the kidney, making delineation of the parenchyma
difficult. There is also extracapsular extension of hemorrhage
from the lower pole. No stone or hydronephrosis seen. Etiology
indeterminate; possibilities include trauma, underlying mass
(not previously seen in [**2188**]), or AV malformation. If cardiac
pacer is MRI compatible and patient's GFR allows administration
of IV gadolinium, MRI may be helpful. Preexisting small upper
pole mass (cf. Impression #2 ) likely not involved in this acute
process.

2. Increased size of right upper pole nodule from 12 to now 22
mm since
[**2188-6-19**].

3. Moderate right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation
with pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF, and DMII who
p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on [**2190-10-30**] found to have
retroperitoneal hemorrhage possibly from renal cyst, transferred
to ICU on day of admission for hypoxia, hypotension, oliguric
acute renal failure with ATN requiring HD, and concern for ACS.
.
(#) Hypoxia.  On day 1 of admission the patient triggered for an
episode of guaic positive emesis and hypoxia to the 80's. This
was thought to be post-tussive emesis with aspiration. He was
started on an 8 day course of azithryomycin, vancomycin, and
ceftriaxone to cover for community acquired pneumonia and
culture positive Klebsiella pneumonia. By the time he arrived to
the ICU his CXR also showed signs of volume overload.  Following
which, his Hct was noted to drop and he required aggressive
volume and blood
