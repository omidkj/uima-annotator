History of Present Illness:
82F with history of UC, PSC s/p biliary stent, COPD and recent
SBP s/p exlap/adhesion lysis admitted with abdominal pain and
fever, concern for cholangitis on levophed for hypotension. Mrs.
[**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 87276**] for SBP requiring ex-lab
with adhesion lysis, c/b post-op ileus. During that admission,
she also underwent ERCP for removal of biliary stent [**7-24**] that
was placed one month earlier for PSC - post-removal imaging
showed normal CBD/CHD and right hepatic duct with known
stricture. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was ultimately discharged to rehab on [**7-27**].
On [**7-29**] patient developed fever, chills, nausea and emesis after
a meal, with no associated abdominal pain. On [**7-30**] (day she went
to ED), continued nausea, fever and new RUQ abdominal pain.
Passing flatus, BM in afternoon. No chest pain, shortness of
breath, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, dysuria. She was sent by
ambulance for ocnern of intra-abdominal process.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.4 P 92 BP 104/58 O2 sat. 93% on
4L. Exam notable for peripheral edema, RUQ discomfort. She was
noted to be hypotensive to SBP 80's, recieved 2L IVF, central
line placed and started on levophed for concern of septic shock.
SUrgery was consulted, CT A/P with no significant change from
prior except for interval removal of biliary stent. CTA chest
with pulmonary embolism in the left lower lobe segmental
arteries. She was given Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl and started on
heparin. Transferred to ICU for further management.
.
On the floor, patient with minimal discomfort.

Chest/Abd CTA [**7-30**]: IMPRESSION:

1. Puklmonary emboli within the left lower lobe segmental
arteries,
visualized despite suboptimal bolus due to hand injection
through central
line. Additional smaller emboli may also be present.

2. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. No
evidence of
pneumonia.

3. Irregular intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, compatible
with history of
primary sclerosing cholangitis. A biliary stent has been
removed. Compared
to [**2199-7-20**], there is likely no change in this process.

4. Status post cholecystectomy.

5. Left renal cyst.

6. No evidence of bowel obstruction. No free fluid or free air,
abscess, or
other postoperative complication status post recent lysis of
adhesions.

Brief Hospital Course:
82F with history of ulcerative colitis, primary sclerosing
cholangitis status-post biliary stenting, COPD admitted with
acute cholangitis and found to have an acute PE

#Acute cholangitis: Patient was initially admitted to the ICU
for hypotension and was fluid resuscitated and required
transient vasopressor support. She was treated with
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole which was continued on discharge
for a full 2 week course. Surgery and GI were consulted who felt
that no intervention was necessary as acute cholangitis was
probably related to recent ERCP and further intervention would
only increase infection risks. Additionally, it was not felt
that cholangitis was due to any focal stricture/obstruction.

#Acute pulmonary embolism: Left lower lobe segmental PE was
found on imaging and patient was started on LMWH bridge to
Coumadin. Pt was not hypoxic with her PEs. She was discharged to
have INR followed by her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].[**Doctor Last Name 87277**] office who would
determine when LMWH could be discontinued. INR on discharge was
1.5.

#Primary sclerosing cholangitis:
Patient has been followed by Hepatology, but will make an
appointment with the Liver clinic following discharge.

#Hypertension: Given initial hypotension and infection the
patient's Lisinopril was held during hospitalization and not
restarted upon discharge as she was not hypertensive while
hospitalized. Patient was instructed to follow up with her PCP
as she will likely need to have her lisinopril restarted once
infection is completely resolved.

#Left carotid artery cavernous sinus aneurysm: Patient had been
evaluated by Neurosurgery previously for evaluation of aneurysm
and was found to have a 7x6mm carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Case was discussed with the patient's Neurosurgeon who felt that
risk of rupture was very low and that if rupture occurred it
would occur in the cavernous space and not the brain. Therefore,
it was felt that the benefits of anticoagulation outweighed the
risks and that the risk of recurrent/worsening PE was higher
than an aneurysmal bleed.

#Dispo: Patient was discharged home with 24 hour care, to get
home PT. She will also get VNA services for assistance with LMWH
injections.
