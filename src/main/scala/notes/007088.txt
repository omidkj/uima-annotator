Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F w/ tachyarrthythmia, HTN, TBI s/p MVC s/p g-tube and
trach for severe tracheomalacia; came to [**Hospital1 18**] w/SOB after being
diagnosed at her rehab with RLL PNA and started on levo and
azithro 2 days PTA.
.
# Pneumonia: We initially switched the patient to levofloxacin
and clinda, the latter being to cover aspiration organisms.
Sputum cultures showed sparse pseudomonas, and fevers continued
despite levo/azithro; trach puts patient at risk for pseudomonas
pneumonia; therefore, we started ceftazadime. Further, we
decided to cover for MRSA given [**Hospital 73683**] healthcare facility
stay, and then coag+ Staph aureus on sputum (again, sparse). The
coag+ Staph aureus eventually showed sensitivity to multiple
antibiotics, so we switched from vancomycin to bactrim. She had
some low-grade spikes on [**11-20**], for which we started her on flagyl
(for possible c. diff), but by [**11-21**] we had a negative C. diff
from [**11-19**] and no other indications, so we discontinued flagyl.
She defervesced during completion of a 14 day course of Abx.
including Bactrim, Ceftazadime, and Ciprofloxacin.  At the time
of discharge, surveillance cx. neg., resp status stable, and o2
sats stable, afebrile.  All abx. were discontinued on [**11-30**] as 14
of therapy completed.
.
# Wheezing: The patient has no chart diagnosis of COPD, but was
often wheezy and benefitted from regular q4 nebs.
.
#Tachyarrhythmia: The patient came with a chart diagnosis of
"tachyarrythmia" and had a number of runs of what we ultimately
diagnosed (with EP consult confirmation) as AVNRT. We continued
home digoxin and metoprolol but increased dig dose (levels were
low at beginning of admission) and metoprolol dose with control
of this rhythm.
.
#Agitation: Patient's mental status is not entirely clear; she
is sometimes interactive and responsive, but not consistently
so. We are currently using soft restraints for tube-pulling and
risky positional changes in bed.
.
#Depression: continued citalopram
.
#DM: continued SS insulin initially, this ultimately
discontinued given good glycemic control without insulin.
.
#HTN: continued metoprolol, BP stable.
.
#Seizure ppx: continued valproic acid for seizure prophylaxis.
.
#FEN: tube feeds continued as per nutrition recommendations.
