Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Toe Pain- found to have upper GI bleeding.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
[**6-22**]: L CIA stent and L CFA angioplasty
[**6-24**]: L CFA and L PFA endarterectomies and dacron patches, L EIA
stents


History of Present Illness:
81 year old female peripheral [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] disease status post right
sided endarterectomy and stenting in [**3-/2128**], as well as atrial
fibrillation/flutter on coumadin, and diastolic CHF, who
presented to an outside hospital on the morning of admission
complaining of toe pain, found to have a hematocrit of 18, with
further history elicited of melena, transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
and being admitted to the MICU for upper GI bleed.
.
The patient says that she has had dark stools for the last 5
days, but what really prompted her to come in was her left foot
pain, which also started a few days ago. She is a poor historian
and has trouble telling the story of what has been going on. She
denies any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. No hematochezia,
no hemoptysis, or hematuria. She denies any chest pain, dyspnea
above her baseline, lightheadedness. No fevers or chills. She
has been taking her daily aspirin, and denies any NSAID use.
.
At the outside hospital vitals were unremarkable on arrival -
she was actually mildly hypertensive. She was given 10 mg of SC
vitamin K. Vitals on arrival to our ED were 98.2, 83, 142/70,
18, 100% on RA. She was guaiac positive and had an NG lavage
with dark stomach material but no overt blood or coffee grounds.
She was seen by [**Hospital1 1106**] surgery regarding her left foot, who
wanted to correct her hematologic problem before considering any
intervention. She received 400 cc of normal saline in the ED and
no blood products prior to transfer to the MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old female with peripheral [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease status post
right sided endarterectomy and stenting in [**3-/2128**], atrial
fibrillation/flutter on coumadin, and diastolic CHF, who
presented to an outside hospital on the morning of admission
complaining of toe pain, found to have a hematocrit of 18, with
further history elicited of melena, admitted to the MICU for
upper GI bleed.
.
1) Upper GI bleed: Likely subacute in nature given hemodynamic
stability. In terms of etiology, patient denies NSAIDs or
abdominal pain. Possibly AVM/gastritis. GI consult obtained,
EGD, coumadin held / PCP to restart on f/u, 2 large bore IVs
strted. On Dc IV removed, IV pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **] - changed to once
a day on DC. Q 6 hour hematocrit checks - once stabalized qd
checks, HCT stable on DC. initially 2 U PRBC now, goal hct 28,
goal met on DC. Will need repeat EGD in 8 weeks to assess for
healing as well as to obtain biopsies to check for Barrett's
esophagus. Avoid NSAIDs.
.
2) Left foot cyanosis/ischemia, peripheral [**Hospital1 1106**] disease:
Patient seen by [**Hospital1 1106**] who feel this is likely a manifestation
of severe peripheral [**Hospital1 1106**] disease with worsened ischemia in
the setting of diminished O2 carrying capacity (severe anemia).
Pt had arterial studies. Underwent a:

a)Abdominal aortogram with limited left lower extremity runoff,
left common iliac artery stent, left common femoral artery
angioplasty.

b)Left common femoral endarterectomy and Dacron patch
angioplasty.

c)Pelvic angiogram, left common iliac angioplasty of previously
placed stent, left external iliac artery stenting.

Pt tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. pt
bloodflow restored, foot symptoms much improved.
.
3) Acute renal failure: Creatinine appears to be around 1.1 at
baseline, but has been elevated to 2.3 on recent admissions.
Currently 1.7, with a high of 2.0 this admission.
.
4) CHF: Diastolic, however on 120 mg furosemide PO daily, and
currently with rales [**2-15**] way up on the left, therefore in the
setting of large fluid administration will give 40 mg IV lasix
and reassess between products. Currently 100% on RA. On DC lasix
stared on her home dose, CXR much improved on DC.
.
5) Atrial fibrillation: Hold coumadin on admission. Held
throught out hospital stay. PCP called on DC. Continue to hold
untill f/u arranged.
.
6) Diabetes, type 2: Will start insulin sliding scale, hold
glipizide, On Dc glypizide restarted.
.
7) Hypercholesterolemia: Continue atorvastatin.
.
8) FEN: NPO.
.
9) Code: Full.
