Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5644**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 year old female with a history of CAD s/p
angioplasty 10 years ago who presented to [**Hospital3 **]Hospital on [**2115-5-16**] for the chief complaint of fevers, chills,
diarrhea and abdominal pain. The patient first noted symptoms on
Saturday when she developed fevers to 102. As a result, she
began to take approximately 12 advils for her fevers Monday to
Tuesday and then subsequently developed "dark" diarrhea with
diffuse abdominal pain and lower back pain (chronic). She also
experienced nausea with minimal, non-bilious vomiting. She
denies any sick contacts. She admits to having increased urinary
frequency, urgency, but denies any dysuria. She had not been
taking any antibiotics before the onset of her diarrhea.

The patient has a history of pyelonephritis approximately 10
years ago. She has had a recent colonoscopy with no
abnormalities. She currently admits to having nonbloody
diarrhea.

At [**Location (un) **], the patient was found to have an anion gap of 22
with a Cr of 5.0 which rose to 5.4 with a K of 5.6. She has no
known baseline renal insufficiency (Cr 0.9-1.0 in [**2111**]). A CT
scan of the abdomen reportedly showed pyelonephritis with
bilateral kidney enlargement and soft tissue, perinephritic
stranding. The patient was started on Ceftriaxone 1 gm. She was
given kayexelate and given IVF with 1 amp of HCO3. Her stool was
described as yellow with her urine cultures pending.

ROS: No chest pain, shortness of breath. The patient has never
had substernal chest pain - her anginal equivalent is right arm
pain.

Past Medical History:
1)CAD s/p cath [**2111**] (right dominant, single vessel disease, 50%
eccentric LAD, RCA diffusely diseased with 100% mid with
left-right collaterals)

2) h/o hematuria- posterior wall thickening noted on CT
abd/pelvis in [**6-/2114**], with normal appeearing kidneys, cr normal
at 0.9, cystoscopy showed no abnormalities, urethral scrituring
from inflammation (treated w/ macrodantoin).


Social History:
The patient lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) **]. She is married
with 3 children. She is a former smoker (quit 10 years ago) and
formerly smoked 1 pdd x 30 years. She denies any EtOH/drug use.

Family History:

Father - CABG in 70s
Brother - DM

Reports:
--------
Abd U/S [**5-17**]: The liver demonstrates no focal or textural
abnormality. The gallbladder is mildly distended with no
evidence of stones or acute cholecystitis. The right kidney
measures 12.2 cm in length and appears mildly full. The cortex
appears echogenic diffusely. There are no stones, masses, or
evidence of hydronephrosis. The left kidney measures 11.4 cm;
Conclusion- Echogenic renal cortices raising the possibility of
chronic renal parenchymal disease. The kidneys appear mildly
full with no evidence of obstruction or perinephric collection.
*
CXR [**5-17**]: No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
process
*
CT Abd [**5-21**]:
1. Bilateral enlarged, edematous kidneys without perinephric
stranding. This appearance may be consistent with medical renal
disease. Other considerations are bilateral renal vein
thrombosis, although the renal veins are do not appear expanded
on this noncontrast study and toxic metabolic injury.
2. Peripancreatic stranding consistent with pancreatitis without
focal fluid collection in the peripancreatic bed.
3. Small right-sided effusion.
4. Atherosclerotic disease of the aorta.
*
ECHO: Conclusions-
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most
likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior
pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
8. While the study is technically limited, there does not appear
to be an
overt evidence of an infilatrative cardiomyopathy.
