ADDENDUM:  This Addendum will cover the dates [**2134-5-2**]
through [**2134-5-8**].

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  ENDOVASCULAR BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient had
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
Subsequent cultures at this hospital after several days of
vancomycin/rifampin treatment showed clear surveillance
cultures which were no growth.

Because an echocardiogram showed no evidence of actual
endocarditis, but questionable plaque in the descending aorta
which may have been a source of infection, he will be
continued on a 6-week course of vancomycin/rifampin given his
bioprosthetic mitral valve.  He has been given 1 gram of
vancomycin for levels of less than 15, which has amounted to
about one dose every three days.  His therapy should stop on
[**2134-5-25**].

The Infectious Disease team was briefly called regarding
alternative antibiotic regimens; however, they agreed that
his current regimen was the most optimal given his penicillin
allergy.

 2.  LEFT CENTRAL RETINAL ARTERY THROMBOSIS ISSUES:  Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 2523**] from Neurology/Ophthalmology re-evaluated the patient
prior to discharge and noted that there was mild improvement
in retinal edema.  Prior to the date of this dictation, the
source of emboli had been investigated but was unclear as he
was therapeutic at the time on Coumadin and a carotid
ultrasound showed only 40% stenosis.  In addition, there was
no thrombus source seen on echocardiography.

Given that he had been on Coumadin at the time, he will be
maintained on a slightly higher range of INR; 2.5 to 3.5
instead of 2 to 3.

 3.  PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient was
noted prior to the time period of this dictation to have
occasional runs of atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response.  However, during the remainder of his
hospitalization his telemetry showed only occasional
premature ventricular contractions and couplets with no
further atrial fibrillation.  He was continued on his home
regimen of propafenone and digoxin.  He also continues on
Coumadin; again with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.

 4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The Renal team continued to
provide input, and it appears that he had a urine sediment
consistent with acute tubular necrosis as many muddy casts
were seen.  He was given 2 units of packed red blood cells
blood transfusion as well as several fluid boluses with
normal saline with improvement in his creatinine to a nadir
thus far of 2.5.  He should be encouraged to take in plenty
of fluids once he is off of intravenous hydration.

 5.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient's hematocrit remained
stable at about 34 after transfusion.

 6.  ANTICOAGULATION ISSUES:   Continued Coumadin,
alternating with 3 mg and 4 mg as dictated below to maintain
an INR of 2.5 to 3.5; which was to be followed by the
patient's primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5395**].

 7.  MENTAL STATUS ISSUES:  The patient appeared to be quite
depressed initially during this time period given his
multiple medical conditions.  The Psychiatry team briefly
stopped by and spoke with the patient's family; although, the
patient decided that he did not wish to speak to Psychiatry.
As his renal function improved, his spirits seem to lighten.
He never showed signs of suicidal ideation.  He appeared to
derive much pleasure in spending time with his family who
were frequent visitors.

 8.  BOWEL REGIMEN ISSUES:  Colace/Senna.

 9.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  A cardiac diet.
Repleted electrolytes as needed.

10.  INTRAVENOUS ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient had left
peripherally inserted central catheter placed through which
he will continue to receive vancomycin.

11.  DISPOSITION ISSUES:  Physical Therapy worked with the
patient several times and deemed that he should be referred
to a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation facility.

12.  CONTACTS:  I have spoken with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21170**] office
several times (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21171**]) to give him a
summary of the patient's condition.  He is aware of the
events that have transpired during the patient's
hospitalization and agreed to continue following the INR.
