proctitis who presents with bright red blood per rectum on
the morning of admission.  The patient had a bloody bowel
movement in his diaper at his nursing home and needed to be
changed four times since that morning.  His blood pressure
was 110/60 and a heart rate of 70 in the field.  The patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
for further evaluation.  In the Emergency Department the
patient was given two large bore intravenouses and he was
given intravenous fluids.  Gastrointestinal bleed scan was
attempted and there was no clear evidence of a
gastrointestinal bleed.  Of note during the bleeding scan the
patient's blood pressure dropped to the 70s and 80s and the
patient was transferred back to the Emergency Department
before the scan could be officially completed.  The patient
was asymptomatic throughout.

[**2186**] echocardiogram with mild AS and aortic regurgitation and
moderate mitral regurgitation.
3.  Prostate cancer status post radiation therapy in [**2183**],

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient's
temperature is 96.9, pulse 82, blood pressure 126/38 that
fell to 88/60 over the course of the day.  Respiratory rate
18.  Satting 97% on room air.  In general, he was an elderly
man sitting, awake, alert, but not oriented to person, place
or time.  Head and neck examination extraocular movements
intact.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Conjunctiva were well
perfuse with no cervical lymphadenopathy.  Cardiac
examination he had a 4 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur and
a 2 out of 6 diastolic murmur at the left upper sternal
border.  His lung examination was limited due to lack of
cooperation, but it seemed that he had decreased breath
sounds at the bases.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities had
no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 7.5 with a normal
differential.  Hematocrit 34.0 and platelets 236.  His chem 7
showed a sodium of 142, potassium 4.9, chloride 106, bicarb
30, BUN 28, creatinine 1.0, glucose 107.  His PTT was 24.8,
INR 1.0, urinalysis negative.  He had an electrocardiogram
that was done that showed Q waves in 2, 3, F and Qs in V1
through V6 with left bundle branch block and PR prolongation.
There was no substantial change from previous
electrocardiograms.  Chest film was performed, which showed
no acute cardiopulmonary disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient's
gastrointestinal bleed was felt likely due to radiation
proctitis since the presentation was less consistent with
diverticular bleed or an AVM.  The patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close hemodynamic
monitoring and serial hematocrits.  The patient's hematocrit
did trend down over the course of the day and was given one
unit of packed red blood cells over the entire course of his
admission with an appropriate bump in his hematocrit and no
further bleeding.  The patient had a sigmoidoscopy, which
showed an ulcer in the rectum, but was limited by poor prep.
The patient was kept overnight in the Intensive Care Unit and
was transferred out to the floor the following day without
complications.  The patient denies any further evidence of
gastrointestinal bleeding.  Follow up flexible sigmoidoscopy
showed the ulcer in the rectum, but was otherwise normal and
these were biopsied.  This will be followed up as an
outpatient the differential being benign ulcers versus
malignancy.

2.  Cardiac:  The patient has a history of congestive heart
failure, but he tolerated the packed red blood cells and
fluid boluses well.  His Atenolol was held out of concern for
hypotension.  There were no ill effects from a congestive
heart failure standpoint.  The patient remained satting well
on room air and he did not have any evidence for congestive
heart failure.  In addition, the patient has a history of
coronary artery disease, however, there was no evidence of
ischemia on electrocardiogram.

3.  Code:  The patient is DNR/DNI.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 100**] Rehab Facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Rectal ulcer.
2.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed.
3.  Radiation proctitis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Sorbitol 30 q.d.
2.  Ambien 5 q.h.s.
3.  Hydrocortisone 1% to scalp.
4.  Atenolol 25 q day, which should only be started once the
patient's blood pressure has normalized back to his baseline.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient should follow up with his
primary care physician within one to two weeks.  The biopsy
will be sent to his primary care physician and further
evaluation and treatment can be decided at that time.
