Allergies:
Lithium

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
"bilious vomiting [pancreatitis]."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
G-tube placement
EGD
colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
66 y/o man with mental retardation v GDD (unknown), minimally
verbal baseline, resident of a 'group home' brought to an osh by
his caregivers for hours of bilious, non bloody, emesis at home
yesterday. Found at osh to have pancreatitis by labs - no
gallstones, no lab evidence of biliary obstruction, sent to our
ED for ? ERCP

In our [**Name (NI) **], pt AF and HD stable, labs sl improved, but notable
for ongoing hypernatremia, pancreatitis (by lipase) - emesis
stopped, rectal exam guaiac NEGATIVE.  CTAP done revealing
bibasilar infiltrates v atelectasis, pancreatitis, no gallstones
or obstruction or other acute abnormality on prelimiary ('wet')
read.

ROS: pt unable to respond given baseline cognitive impairment -
repeats questions back to me in echolalic fashion only.

Past Medical History:
-mental delay (etiology unclear at this time but documented in
record we have
-hx. pna
-hx seizures (type unknown)
-mention in record of recent rt clavicular fracture (etiology
unknown, but I suspect a fall)

Social History:
lives in group home, brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 410**] is HCP but wishes to
have guardianship established because he lives 300 miles away-he
was made guardian when their father died

Family History:
pt. unable to answer

Physical Exam:
AF and VSS
NAD, somnolent but arousable
Face symmetric
Speech fluent - repeats spoken words back to me (echolalia)
RRR, no MRG
Bibasilar rales, otherwise clear to auscultation, no wheezes
Abdomen distended, tender to deep palpation by grimacing and
vocalization, BS diminished, no rebound, no guarding
Moves all extremities symmetrically - did not comply with formal
neuro exam, so assisted (by two persons) to sitting and then
standing in lieu of formalized testing - pt. able to do this
with assist of two, once standing, able to stand with
contact-guard assistance of two persons to min assist.  Bears
weight and moves both sides symmetrically.
Has no rash
Trace bt LE edema, Lt very slightly greater than rt, however, no
ertythema or tenderness to suggest a DVT

EGD [**2174-3-4**]
Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Normal mucosa in the stomach
Friability and erythema in the duodenal bulb and first part of
the duodenum compatible with duodenitis (biopsy)

.
[**2174-2-19**] CT AP
IMPRESSION:
1. Peripancreatic stranding, consistent with known pancreatitis
without
evidence for pseudocyst formation.
2. Bilateral lower lobe consolidations, which may represent
aspiration or
pneumonia.
3. Liver hypodensities may represent cysts or hemangiomas, but
are not
further characterized. Consider ultrasound for further
characterization.
.
CXR [**2174-2-19**]
IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lung opacities, which may represent
pneumonia.  Continued radiographic follow up is recommended.
.
[**2174-2-19**] right clavicle XR
There is cortical step-off of the inferior margin of the
clavicle, worrisome for fracture.

Colonoscopy:
Impression: Melanosis coli was noted scattered in the cecum.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

Recommendations: No etiology of the anemia could be found.
Given fair prep would repeat colonosocpy in [**4-18**] years for
screening purposes.  Further work-up for anemia per inpatient GI
team.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] is a 66 y.o man with a history of global
developmental delay vs. mental retardation, CKD III-VI, bipolar
disorder, and ? seizure disorder, who presented with
pancreatitis, and whose course has been complicated by course of
pancreatitis, treated conservatively, persistent hypernatremia,
HCAP, critically high hyperglycemia and inability to
consistently tolerate po liquids and solids.
.
# DM2/Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state: As suggested by serum BG
critically high, >600, serum bicarb >18, osms elevated (379 this
am). Difficult to assess mental status given baseline
non-communicative. It was unclear exactly what precipitated this
hyperglycemic state given no known history of diabetes. Pt had
been receiving essentially continuous D5W for tx of
hypernatremia, but this should not have caused blood glucose
that high if pt is not diabetic. HgbA1c 6.9. D5W in setting of
recent infection (see below) could precipitate hyperglycemia,
but would not expect levels to be >300. Possible that given
recent pancreatitis episode, pt could have burnout and
essentially no insulin production at this time. Patient was
transferred to the ICU for further management. Insulin gtt with
D5 was started and BG was monitored closely. Endocrine was
consulted, and pt was transitioned to insulin SC once BG
improved. Pt's A1c returned as 6.9. He was started on Lantus was
ISS.  Endocrine followed on the medicine floor and uptitrate his
basal lantus as needed.  His FSBG improved significantly.
- Discharged on Lantus 15 units with HISS.  Further titration as
deemed necessary.  WIll need uptitration of Lantus.  FSBG in
200s on discharge
.
# Hypernatremia/Nephrogenic DI:  Ddx included DI from
nephrogenic or central process vs. [**3-17**] osmotic diuresis and
insensible losses with fever. From previous notes, pt appears to
have possible nephrogenic DI from Lithium in the past. Pt was
hypernatremic on presentation, though not improving even with
free water, which is likely tied in with the hyperglycemia and
osmotic diuresis as above. Pt has been putting out over 6L per
day, and continues to be volume down. Pt's Na on admission was
154, and on transfer to the ICU, it was 166 (corrected for
elevated glucose). Patient's free water deficit was calculated
and he was given D5W with a goal of decreased corrected Na+ by
0.5meq/hr. Chem 7 was checked q3-4hrs and IVF rate was adjusted
accordingly. Endocrine was consulted as above. He was continued
on D5W while in the ICU. He was encouraged to take free water po
but was unable to do so on his own.  His free water deficit was
calculated as 3.6L per day.  This was initially via D5W and then
a G-tube was placed.  Following this he was started on free
water flushes 600 cc Q4H and his blood sugars were much easlier
to control.
- As tube feeds were initiated, his water intake was decreased
slightly to 500ml q4 hrs, but resumed at 600ml
- He REQUIRES constant free water to maintain normal Na levels,
via his G tube.  If this has to be stopped for some reason,
please monitor his sodium closely.  PLEASE give 600ml free water
q4 through G tube
.
# Sinus Bradycardia: Pt arrived to the ICU bradycardic to 40s,
and hypertensive to 180s systolic. When looking back in the
chart, pt has been intermittently bradycardic and then
tachycardic. DDx for this includes hypothyroidism, hypothermia,
electrolyte abnormalities, sick sinus syndrome, MI or increased
intracranial pressure. Initially concerned about cerebral edema
given worsening hypernatremia, however, pt is agitated, but not
somnolent, and per nursing staff on the medicine floors, his
mental status has been relatively unchanged. He was monitored on
telemetry and HR improved to 70s with treatment of hyperglycemia
and sodium. TSH 2.8, trop negative x1.
.
# Hypothermia: DDx includes infection vs. hypothyroidism vs.
central process. Pt has known infection, and being treated with
HCAP coverage. Pt has ?seizure disorder, and neuroleptics
recently changed. TSH WNL. Temperature improved with resolution
of hypergl
