History of Present Illness:
51 y/o F with h/o Hep C, COPD, and sz disorder presents from
home w/ hypoxia and ?seizure. Recent MICU admit [**Date range (2) 98617**]
with respiratory failure requiring intubation and subsequent
tracheostomy attributed to ARDS (suspected viral etiology). She
was treated w/ broad spectrum antibiotics and steroids. Course
c/b VAP due to Klebsiella and Serratia ([**Last Name (un) 36**] meropenem; res
cephalosporins), coag (-) staph line infection (s/p vanco X 14
days). Pt was discharged to rehab [**2160-4-7**]; trach removed and pt
d/c home [**2160-4-25**].  She initially went to in-laws with husband
for 4-5 hours, the three of whom were recently diagnosed with
bronchitis.  She then went to stay with her sister and mother
for 1 week were she received VNA services.  On [**2160-5-2**], she went
to her home with her husband, who she had not been exposed to in
1 week.  On [**5-3**], she c/o being tired.  On day of admission, [**5-4**].
per family, pt awoke feeling "[**Last Name (un) 98618**]" and short of breath.
Because she felt like she was going to have a seizure, she
presented to OSH, where she was noted to be hypoxic 84% RA ->
90s on 100% NRB. An x-ray shwed bilateral infiltrates, and she
received levofloxacin 500 mg IV X 1 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management. In [**Name (NI) **] pt 96% 100% NRB, sbp 80s-90s. She
was initially conversant, however then she had episodes where
her eyes rolled up in her head, and she began posturing her
upper extremities. Each episode lasted 10-15 seconds, occurring
every 1-2 minutes for a total of 20 minutes. She received 2 mg
IV Ativan for suspected seizure, after which she was somnolent.
Neuro was consulted, who was concerned for status epilepticus
and pt received 20 mg/kg IV Fosphenytoin. Further history/ROS
could not be obtained [**3-5**] patient's mental status.
.
She had a course in the MICU which was complicated by failed
extubation on [**5-5**] and [**5-13**]. and had bronchoscopy which on
microbiology but not pathology showed viral cytopathic changes,
possibly c/w CMV pneumoitis, but no immunostains had been done.
She has had a history in the past of klebsiella and serratia VAP
(pan-sensitive) and one [**2-6**] Klebs blood cx which was ESBL, but
on this admission has not had any positive cultures for blood,
sputum, BAL, CSF, urine, c diff tox, flu, or legionella.  TTE
has shown diastolic dysfunction with EF 60% and 1+ MR and
mild-mod pulmonary artery HTN. BB have been controlling her rate
well.
.
She has been on moerately high doses of benzodiazepines for
sedation. and on prednisone for stress dosing, and has been
weaning off of both.  She also recently had her NGT removed and
with a (+) gag reflex was started on a nectar thick diet until
video swallow assessment could be made. In the meantime, her
glargine has been held due to low oral intake.
.
Her subclavian and arterial lines have been removed and she is
maintained by peripheral iv's.

Brief Hospital Course:
NOTE: THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE.  PLEASE
SEE THE SECTION "DISPOSITION" FOR THE RELEVANT DETAILS.  THE
HOSPITAL COURSE UP TO THIS POINT IS SUMMARIZED FIRST:

A/P: 51 yoF w/ h/o COPD, seizure disorder recent admit w/ ARDS
presents w/ leukocytosis, hypoxia, and episodes concerning for
seizure.  Intubated with ARDS of unclear etiology, failed
extubation x2 ([**5-5**] and [**5-13**]) with hypoxic resp failure of
unclear etiology.
*
1) Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure and ARDS: Unclear
cause.  All cultures were negative, including blood, sputum,
BAL, CSF, urine, c dif, flu, legionella.  Intubated in ED with
ABG of 7.26/76/139.  On nebs, flovent.  Pt was covered for 1
week with meropenum, azithro, vanco  until [**5-10**] (pt has h/o
klebsiella/serretia VAP and ESBL Klebs bacteremia).  Second
attempt at extubation was attempted [**5-13**], and the patient did
well initially, but then acutely desaturated and was
reintubated.  Aspiration vs. flash pulm edema were considered as
factors complicating extubation.
.
Pt was beta-blocked and a Swan-Ganz catheter was in place before
the third extubation attempt on [**5-16**] in order to diagnose and
manage acute manifestations of heart failure upon extubation.
BAL microbiology but not pathology showed cytopathic changes but
viral and bacterial cultures as well as CMV immunology were
negative.
.
2) Seizure: Pt has a h/o seizure disorder, the precipitant of
which may be proximate to inadequate treatment on a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
(dilantin) in the setting of fever and hypoxia.  Head CT and
urine tox were neg.  An EEG showed diffuse encephalopathy
without status epilepticus.  Additional history obtain
