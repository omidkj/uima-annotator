History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25280**] is an 81 y/o M with extensive past cardiac history
including CAD (s/p CABG, prior PCIs with stenting), ischemic
cardiomyopathy with LVEF of 20% and NYHA class III CHF (s/p [**Known lastname 3941**]
placement), DM, HLD, HTN, A.fib (on Coumadin), PVD (chronic
lower extremity ulcers) who presented with chest pain.

The patient was at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and at 02:10 AM was noted to
have acute onset substernal chest pressure without radiation,
[**8-18**] in intensity, BP 106 mmHg systolic at that time. EMS called
and received report that patient had an episodic HR of 160 bpm
without symptoms (unverified). Received nitro SL with
improvement in pain. Also got ASA. On arrival, CP was [**2-17**] and
substernal without dyspnea. No nausea, palpitations or
diaphoresis. Denied shortness of breath or leg swelling.

Of note, the patient was recently admitted here [**Date range (1) 25296**] with
hypotension. No clear etiology identified during that admission
but suspected to be cardiac. An echo showed a reduction in LVEF
to 20% from ~30%. There were intermittent NSVT episodes. Also
had slowly downtrending crit related to possible GIB. Mildly
anemic and received 1 unit PRBCs. No scope performed but scope
in [**2-19**] showed moderate gastritis, duodenal ulcer. He has known
diverticuli.

Mr. [**Known lastname 25280**] saw his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on the day PTA
where he was noted to be doing well. An [**Last Name (STitle) 3941**] interrogation did
reveal on VF episode requiring shock.

In the ED, initial VS were 98.3 110 106/62 16 94% 2L Nasal
Cannula. Labs revealed hct of 27.0, lactate of 5.7, Cr 2.0
(baseline 1.3), BNP 11,422 (baseline ~5,000), trop 0.04 (c/w
prior). ECG showed a.fib @ 114, LAD, occassional PVCs and IVCD,
non-specific ST-changes with peaked T-waves (similar to
previous). CXR without acute process. Guiac (+) with maroon
stool in vault. The patient received vanc/levo/flagyl in the ED
due to concern for sepsis.

On arrival to the [**Last Name (STitle) **] initial VS were 97/55 109 100%2L. Patient
is mentating well and [**Last Name (STitle) **] any CP/palp/SOB. Reports feeling
cold. No signs of active infection and broad spectrum abx not
continued in [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Can re-start if becoming febrile.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25280**] is an 81 y/o M with extensive [**Known lastname 1106**] history who
presented with chest pain and anemia. Transferred to MICU due to
concern of demand ischemia in setting of LGIB.

#Chest Pain - The patient has an extensive coronary history. His
present episode of chest pain ocurred in the setting of
tachycardia to the 160s (reported by EMS) and a hematocrit below
his baseline. Given pt's EKG and clinical picture, the elevated
troponin was most likely demand ischemia. He was given packed
RBCs to increase oxygen supply for increased demand.   A CHF
exacerbation despite an elevated BNP, but unclear likely given
clear lungs and no fluid overload on CXR.  Other etiologies
including PE was considered but his INR was supratherepeutic and
pt was not hypoxic. Cardiology was [**Known lastname 4221**] and did not believe
that this was ACS and did not recommend coronary angiography.

# Anemia - The patient has a long history of anemia and has
known history of gastric erosions, but no ulcers, and
diverticuli. CT Abdomen this month has no evidence of
malignan
