[**2154-10-4**] CXR
Well defined nodule projecting over 9th left posterior rib.

[**2154-10-11**] CXR
Small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.

[**2154-10-7**] CT Chest
1. A 19-mm nodular lesion in the lingula showing eccentric
calcifications, is concerning for a scar carcinoma or other lung
cancer. PET/CT would be helpful for further evaluation.
2. Peribronchial thickening and mild bronchiectasis in the left
lower lobe and right middle lobe, likely due to endobronchial
infection.
3. Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
4. Multiple noncalcified less than 5-mm pulmonary nodules;
followup for these is recommended in three to six months.
5. Coronary artery calcifications.
6. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
7. Hypodense 10 mm lesion in the liver,likely a cyst
8. Gall stones.

[**2154-10-8**] Carotid Ultrasound
No appreciable plaque or wall thickening involving either
carotid system. Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

[**2154-10-9**] EKG
Sinus rhythm
Ventricular premature complexes
Consider left atrial abnormality
Right bundle branch block
Consider prior inferior myocardial infarction
ST-T wave abnormalities are diffuse - cannot exclude in part
ischemia -
clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2154-10-6**], ventricular ectopy, right
bundle branch
block, and further ST-T wave changes present.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2154-10-5**] for surgical
management of her coronary artery disease. She was worked-up by
the cardiac surgical service in the usual preoperative manner
including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed no flow
limiting stenosis. A chest x-ray revealed a nodule which was
further worked-up by a chest CT scan. This revealed a 19 x 13 mm
nodular lesion in the lingula with some eccentric
calcifications. Noncalcified nodules, smaller than 5mm, were
seen in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, lingula,
and left lower lobe. Mild bronchiectasis and peribronchial
thickening is noted in the left lower lobe and right middle lobe
with thickening along the right major fissure. The airways are
patent up to the subsegmental bronchi. There are no pleural of
pericardial effusions. An 11-mm internal mammary and 15-mm
precarinal enlarged lymph nodes were also noted. Follow-up CT
scan and or PET scan were recommended in the future to assess
the stability of these lesions. Levofloxacin was started for a
urinary tract infection. On [**2154-10-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the
operating room where she underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels. Postoperatively she was taken to the
cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On
postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated. She grew pseudomonas in her sputum for which
she was switched to clindamycin. The pulmonology service was
consulted for bronchiectasis who recommended good pulmonary
toilet and incentive spirometry. Later on postoperative day one,
she was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for
further recovery. Ms. [**Known lastname **] was gently diuresed toward her
preoperative weight. She developed atrial fibrillation which
converted to normal sinus rhythm with amiodarone. Her drains and
pacing wires were removed per protocol. The physical therapy
service worked with Ms. [**Known lastname **] to help with her postoperative
strength and mobility. She continued to make steady progress and
was discharged home on postoperative day five. She will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist and her primary
care physician as an outpatient.
