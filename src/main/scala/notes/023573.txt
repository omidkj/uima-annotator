Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
"JP drains falling out"


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 yo F with MMP including CAD s/p CABG in [**3-/2113**] with
subsequent chronic sternal wound infection with multiple highly
resistant organisms and a recent admission for fever who now
re-presents from rehab because one of her two JP drains was
accidentally pulled out and the other partially displaced at
rehab. Rehab facility noted displaced JP drains on morning
rounds and patient sent to ED.

In the ED, initial VS were T 99.3 H 140 BP 110/60 RR 20 O2 Sat
100% on RA. Pt then developed a rectal temp of 102.2. Labs
showed elev WBC, low K and low Mg. Lactate was 2.3, but no anion
gap. UA was indicative of infection, urine cx was sent and is
pending. Pt received IVF with K in ED as well as some Mg. Pt was
on Daptomycin and Colistin for FUO from recent hospital stay. Pt
received COlistin in ED, but not the Daptomycin.  Pt was
evaluated by Plastic Surgery in the ED who thought there were no
signs of wound infection  and pt does not need JP drain
replacement at this time. CXR preliminarily did not show any
consolidation. CT head showed no bleed, just a known mass with
no surrounding edema. Pt also got Tylenol in ED for fever. Pt's
HR improved to 100s after fluids. BP hsa been stable throughout.
RR in 20-24 range, satting high 90s on 2L NC. Urine and [**Year (4 digits) **] cx
have been sent. On trasnfer, VS were T 99.6  HR 110  BP 128/70
RR 26  O2 100% on 2L NC.

On the floor, pt appears chronically ill, unable to answer more
than "yes and no" questions.  Pt denies any pain.  Denies
shortness of breath, cough.

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the technique
of the image is improved. Borderline size of the cardiac
silhouette. No pulmonary edema.  No focal parenchymal opacity

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a chronically ill 67 yo female with CAD s/p CABG
complicated by sternal wound infection, diastolic CHF admitted
after JP drains fell out, found to have fever to 102 in ED and
BCx + for enteroccocus and Coag neg staph, hospital course
complicated by hypotension and pulmonary edema requiring MICU
transfers with goals of care now focusing on comfort.

# History of PE: The pt was intially on coumadin but noted to
refuse, pocket or spit out many po meds daily. Once admitted to
MICU the pt was started on argatroban (due to history of HIT)
for bridging to a therapeutic INR. She had a CTA that was
negative for PE. Her coumadin was stopped per goals of care.

# Bacteremia: [**Month/Day/Year **] cultures grew enterococcus faecalis and coag
neg staphyloccus both sensitiv to daptomycin. She was afebrile
without leukocytosis. TTE did not show valve vegatations. She
was continued on colistin/dapto until [**2114-10-31**] when all
antibiotics were stopped per goals of care without plan to .

# Normocytic Anemia: Iron studies consistent with anemia of
chronic disease. HCT dropped with daily survillience [**Month/Day/Year **]
cultures and improved when [**Month/Day/Year **] draws were limited.

# Chronic sternal wound infection: Sternal wound is clean, dry,
intact. She was seen and evaluated by plastics and there was no
need to replace drains at this time. She was continued on
dapto/colistin until [**2114-10-31**]. Her wounds were dressed per wound
care recommendations.

# Diabetes II: FS at goal, she did not require insulin and
insulin sliding scale was stopped.

# Afib/NSVT: HR regular. has ICD.  Metoprolol XL 200 mg po was
decreased to 25 mg po BID.

# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Stable on discharge. On [**10-23**]
the pt was noted to be tachypneic, tachycardic, and requiring
increasing amts of supplemental oxygen. The pt required NRB O2,
and was transferred to the MICU. Her respiratory status improved
with lasix, and in the ICU the pt was diuresed gently. She was
not restarted on an ACE inhibitor as she was hypotensive for
much of her admission. She was discharged on furo
