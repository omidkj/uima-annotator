History of Present Illness:
53M h/o severe COPD, tracheomalacia, recent PEA arrest in the
setting of tracheostomy change, with course c/b VAP and c. diff

of ongoing fever, and altered mental status.

Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab transfer summary, he was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]

was taken to the OR by orthopedics for repair.  In that setting,
Tmax 102 (rectal).  He was continued on vanco/flagyl for
presumed c. diff, but cultures returned negative, so this was
stopped.  He was discharged with instructions to complete a
course of Meropenem until [**11-23**] for ESBL E. Coli UTI based on
cultures from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
.
Since returning to rehab, his WBC was increasing, to 19 by
report.  At some point, he was restarted empirically on
antibiotics (linezolid, and imipenem) for unclear source, which
were d/c'd on [**12-16**] when his fevers improved.  On [**12-19**] he was
noted to have a tmax 101.0 at 3PM, and was restarted on
linezolid/imipenem empirically.  UCx and CXR at NH were
unremarkable.  He was treated for increasing agitation with
zyprexa, increased to 7.5mg tid on [**12-19**].  He was reported to be
c. diff positive (no culture data available), and continued on
po vancomycin 250mg po tid.
.
In ED, VS=96.9  112/68  98  14  100% on unclear settings, but
CPAP  by report.  Tmax 97.9.  Labs notable for leukocytosis to
13.  R foot erythema and fluctuance noted, he recieved IV vanco
x 1, and podiatry consulted.  I&D performed, which was largely
hematoma by report.  UA essentially negative.  Blood and wound
cultures sent.  He is admitted for further workup of fever,
altered mental status.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 14302**] is a 53 yo man admitted from rehab with fevers,
altered mental status and right foot erythema.

agitation over past week prior to admission in the setting of
not sleeping.  He was noted to be highly anxious while in the
hospital, and there was also felt to be an element of depression
on his home olanzapine and klonopin.  After discussion with his
sister, he was started on citalopram 20 mg QD for depression, to
be increased as tolerated.  On admission he was agitated, though
this improved with treatment of his cellulitis.

CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 14302**] suffers from lower back pain.  He was started on
standing Tylenol, Lidocaine patch and PRN tarmadol for his
symptoms.

COPD, CHRONIC STEROIDS, s/p TRACH:
Patient is s/p trach and was maintained on MMV vent settings of
.
Patient was initially started on stress dose steroids, which was
changed back to his home prednisone dose of 7 mg on [**2126-12-24**].
This should be weaned as tolerated per out-patient PCP &
pulmonologist.  He was continued on bactrim prophylaxis, as well
as his home regimen of prednisone, and inhalers.

HYPOTENSION
The patient had a brief episode of hypotension which
self-resolved without the use of pressors.

DECREASE HEMATOCRIT:
Patient had a hematocrit drop from 24 to 17, repeated at 19, and
was transfused 2 units PRBC with increase of hematocrit to 31.
Though it was suspected the hct of 17 and 19 were false lows,
given the significant increase in hct with transfusion, CT abd
was ordered to evaluate for any site of occult bleeding and was
negative. Hemolysis labs (LDH, direct and indirect bilirubin)
did not suggest hemolysis.

CONCERN FOR POSSIBLE C DIFF COLITIS:
With his history of C diff, vancomycin PO was started
empirically for C diff pn admission. He had one stool C diff
toxin that was negative on [**2126-12-23**] and another that was
negative on [**2126-12-24**].  PO vancomycin was discontinued.

RIGHT ULNAR/HUMERUS FRACTURE:
Pain control was continued per home regimen (tylenol, fentanyl
patch, klonopin), and patient was continued on home calcium,
vitamin d.

SEIZURE:  Patient was continued on home Keppra
