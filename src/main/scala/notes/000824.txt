Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia s/p elective ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 yo F with a past medical history significant for
COPD, CHF, CAD s/p CABG, CVA, who became increasingly hypoxic
and tachypneic following an elective ERCP today. The patient was
recently admitted to an OSH with cholangitis, treated and sent
to [**Hospital1 599**] [**Hospital1 1501**] in [**Location (un) 1439**] with this ERCP scheduled electively.
.
On the last admission in [**4-24**], the patient reportedly had
cholangitis induced sepsis. She underwent an ERCP at that time
and had a stent placed in the CBD. She was treated with
antibiotics and volume resuscitation and discharged to [**Hospital1 1501**] with
a scheduled follow up ERCP when the patient had stabilized.
.
From the ERCP periprocedure notes, the patient arrived today
satting 88% on 4L by NC. She was intubated for the procedure and
received a total of 400cc LR during the procedure and 500cc of
fluid in the PACU. She then gradually became more tachypneic to
20-25 and desatted to 88% on 4L, which increased to the low 90's
on 6L. She was given a nebulizer and a MICU eval was requested.

.
On initial evaluation, the patient was slightly tachypneic,
satting 89-91% on 6L by facemask. An ABG and CXR were requested
and given the patient's history of CHF and the fact that she
takes daily lasix and received almost 1L of fluid in several
hours, a dose of 40mg IV lasix was suggested as well.
.
A foley was placed and lasix administered, which the patient
responded to promptly, with improvement of her symptoms. CXR was
confirmatory for diffuse perihilar infiltrates characteristic of
pulmonary edema. Anesthesia placed an a-line and then obtained
an ABG which was 7.30/66/93 and after several hundred cc's of
diuresis, it improved to 7.34/63/98 (on 6L facemask). She was
then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo F with acute hypoxia and tachypnea following elective
ERCP, due to volume overload, exacerbated by sleep apnea.
.
1. Respiratory Distress: Given her improved CXR and clinical
picture post-diuresis, it appeared that the primary cause of
respiratory distress was likely fluid overload, and most likely,
given that her sats were already decreased pre-procedure, that
she was already volume overloaded before even receiving the
additional liter of fluid pre-procedure. She was successfully
diuresed about 3L with noticeable improvement in pulmonary
status. Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3. Of note, the patient
has multiple apneic episodes with significant desaturations
while sleeping highly suggestive of OSA / central sleep apnea.
Blood gas analysis suggests improvement of respiratory acidosis
with bipap 10/5/5L, likely chronic compensatory metabolic
alkalosis. By the time she was transferred out to the floor, she
was on her baseline O2 requirement of 2L by NC, and tolerating
bipap at night well. On the floor the patient had one episode of
oxygen desaturation to the 70s which resolved with increasing
oxygen via nasal canula to 5L.  A cxr was obtained at that time
which showed prominent pulmonary edema.  The patient's diuretic
regimen was increased to 40mg po bid however her serum
creatinine continued to rise and her lasix was held.  Her oxygen
saturation however has remained stable at her baseline requiring
2Liters nasal canula to maintain oxygen saturation at 92-94%.
We have restarted her lasix at a lower dose of 20mg daily.  She
has continued on her prior COPD regimen of spiriva, low dose
prednisone and nebs prn.
2. s/p ERCP - patient is stable from an ERCP perspective with
successful removal of stone from CBD and subsequent
sphincterotomy. LFTs trended down and normalized by [**6-28**].  She
will only need outpatient GI follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if she
develops new abdominal symptoms or has recurrent evidence of
obstruction.

3. Cardiac
Ischemia - known CAD s/p MI, CABG. No evidence of ischemia on
EKG, enzymes negative.  Her BP meds were initially held after
she was transferred to the ICU however the isosorbide was added
back upon transfer to the floor.   The patient remained chest
pain free during the entire hospitalization.  Given her history
of CAD, a lipid panel was obtained showing evidence of
hypercholesterolemia with a cholesterol total of 259, LDL 158,
and triglycerides 250.  She was started on lipitor 20mg po daily
and will need to have her LFTs monitored in the future.  We have
added back her lopressor at a lower dose of 12.5mg po twice
daily which can be titrated as needed.


5. ARF - unclear baseline creatinine, prior cr of 1.5 suggesting
likely CKD at baseline.  As discussed above, her creatinine rose
to a maximum of 2.6 and we felt this was likely attributed to
lower BP (systolics in the 110s) in combination with diuresis.
On the day of discharge her serum creatinine is 1.7.  There were
no electrolyte abnormalities during this hospitalization.  She
will need future monitoring of her renal function while at
rehab.  We suggest checking a complete metabolic panel on [**7-2**].

6. s/p CVA - coumadin held for ERCP
-Resuming coumadin at prior dose of 5mg po daily.  She will need
follow up with her PCP and neurologist regarding goals of care.
She is currently subtherapeutic and will need continued
coagulation panels.  She is not a candidate for lovenox given
her renal function and it was felt that the risks outweighed the
benefits for starting her on IV heparin at this time.  This was
discussed with the patient's daughter who serves as the
health-proxy.
.
7. Depression, anxiety, ?psychosis
- continue ritalin, lexapro
- continue to hold all sedating meds
.
7. FEN: Low sodium diet, heart healthy, puree diet. Continue to
monitor electrolytes.
.
8. PPx: heparin subcut, bowel reg, ppi was administered while
she was an inpatient.
