She had a two pack per day history of smoking for 35 years
but quit sometime ago.  She is an occasional social alcohol
drinker.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 11386**] was admitted on [**2152-11-8**] for
removal of intravenous spinal cord stimulator and intrathecal
pump.  She had those placed four years prior for management
of her chronic lower back pain. She tolerated procedure well
and was placed on Cefazolin postoperatively.

Postoperatively she did well and was transferred to the
floor.  Initially she was placed on PCA and then switched to
p.o. pain medications.  She developed some urinary
incontinence subsequently a urology consultation was
obtained.  On [**2152-11-10**] she spiked a temperature of 102.8 and
an episode of desaturation down to 89% on two liters nasal
prongs.  A medical consult was then obtained.  A fever workup
was largely negative at the time.  Her white count was 7.4,
her urinalysis was negative.  Her cardiac enzymes were
negative.  A chest x-ray showed slight prominence of
pulmonary arteries bilaterally, no evidence of pneumonia.
She continued to spike fevers up to 102 degrees Farenheit.
Follow-up on blood and urine cultures were negative and she
was changed to Levaquin for antibiotic coverage.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 11386**]
continued to have fevers and was subsequently switched to
Vancomycin and Zosyn for broader coverage.  A follow-up chest
x-ray suggested evidence of a left lower lobe pneumonia.  She
was continued on Zosyn and Vancomycin.  The patient continued
to have a fever and elevated white count up to 19.5. An
abdominal CT was obtained on [**2152-11-17**] which showed multiple
collections underneath the liver.  A general surgery consult
was then obtained.  She was found to have two loculated
abscesses in  the right subhepatic and a lower right quadrant.

The patient was sent on [**2152-11-19**] for percutaneous drainage of
the subhepatic abscesses.  She tolerated the procedure well
without complications.  The abscess originally drained 100
cc's of purulent fluid and a drain was left in place.  The
patient continued to have fevers and an elevated white count. A
repeat CT suggested that the inferior abscess might be
amenable to drainage.  On [**2152-11-20**] Mrs. [**Known lastname 11386**] was brought back to
Interventional Radiology for drainage of the inferior collection.
She tolerated the procedure well and the drain was left in place.
The superior drain was replaced with a new one and 100 cc's of
purulent fluid was extracted.  She tolerated procedure well
without complications.

Subsequently, her temperature came down to 100.5 with
occasional spikes.  She continued to defervesced over the
next several days.  Her diet was advanced and she was taken
off TPN.  Cultures of the fluid collections showed
enterococcus, lactobacilli and fungal growth.  Intravenous
Fluconazole was added to her antibiotics.

She is currently ambulating well independently.  She has been
tolerating p.o. intake with no nausea or vomiting.  She has
had regular bowel movements and has been passing flatus.  She
has been switched to oral antibiotics and has been afebrile.
She will require follow-up CT.  She is currently stable for
discharge and will require follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**].

1. Chronic Pain and Spinal Degeneration
2. Peritonitis with abscess for loculated perforated viscous
3. Hypovolemia requiring fluid rescusitation
4. Seizure disorder
