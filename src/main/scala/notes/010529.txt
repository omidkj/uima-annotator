Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and underwent a right pigtail catheter
placemment for a moderate amount bloody fluid and left
thoracentesis for 1100cc of serosang fluid.

On [**7-22**], the patient experienced hypotension with systolic
pressure dropping the high 60s. He responded to fluid
resuscitation. EKG and cardiac enzymes were normal. Creatinine
also was elevated but also responded to fluids. He was
maintained on a heparin drip.

A chest CT revealed a trapped right lung with pleural band mass.
 On [**2201-7-24**] he underwent Right video-assisted thoracoscopy
converted to right thoracotomy, decortication of lung, along
with pleural biopsy and Diagnostic esophagogastroscopy.  He was
transferred to the ICU and remained intubate. He was
subsequently extubated without incident in the ICU.  He received
1 unit of PRBCs for a low hematocrit.

He was transferred to the floor on [**2201-7-27**]. Physical therapy
evaluated the patient on [**7-27**] and deemed the patient appropriate
for rehab at discharge. A CT guided pigtail was placed on [**7-29**]
for a continued pleural effusion. He was treated for a UTI from
cultures on [**2201-7-31**].

On [**7-31**] the patient had a large tarry guaiac positive bowel
movement. He was transfused 2 units and maintained his
hematocrit. GI was consulted and recommended colonscopy, [**Hospital1 **] PPI
and EGD. Anticoagulation was held. Hematocrit remained stable.
The patient was also transfused on [**8-3**] for a chronically low
hematocrit. All chest tubes and pigtails were removed over the
course of several days.

On [**8-6**], the patient was sent for colonoscopy and EGD. He
refused these studies. He  was extensively counseled on the
risks of not performing these studies, the risk being GI
bleeding. He was also was told and acknowledged that this would
limit his ability to be anticoagulated at this time. He was
informed of his risk for stroke with a history of atrial
fibrillation and continued to defers the study.

Both the patient's wife and cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10543**] were informed
of his decision. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10543**] in 1 week to
discuss further anticoagulation.
