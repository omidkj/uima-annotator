REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Hypotension, hypoxia, sepsis,
complicated by multisystem organ failure, pneumonia,
acidosis.

The patient is a 47 year old female with a history of
multiple myeloma refractory to treatment who presents with
hypotension, respiratory failure, septicemia, pneumonia.  She
was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] to [**Hospital6 649**] on [**2156-8-7**].  She developed a cough several
days prior to admission, according to her fiance on
[**2156-8-5**].  She was seen in the oncology clinic and
complained of progressive headache that had begun on [**2156-8-4**],
which she described as a band encompassing the perimeter of
her scalp.  She had a history of hyperviscosity syndrome
secondary to her uncontrolled myeloma.  She denied visual
changes, nausea or vomiting, or other symptoms at that time.
The patient had recently had plasmapheresis for
hyperviscosity/high IgG.  That procedure was on [**2156-8-5**].
At the end of the procedure, she had shaking chills but no
fever and she was hemodynamically stable.  On [**2156-8-6**] at
5:00 am, she had an unwitnessed fall and her fiance found her
nearly unresponsive and brought her to the [**Hospital1 46**] E.R.

She had temperature of 104 and was hypotensive.  She received
I.V. fluids, four units of packed red blood cells, four units
of platelets, four units of FFP.  Levophed and Neo-Synephrine
were started.  She was intubated for acidosis.  Antibiotics
were changed to Zosyn, sparfloxacin, vancomycin, and
Levaquin.  She was dialyzed times two for acidemia.
Vasopressor was added.  She was paralyzed and MedFlighted to
[**Hospital1 18**] for continued dialysis.  Blood cultures were drawn and
grew out Gram-negative rods.  Chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 46**] showed
right pneumonia.  Later the blood cultures were to reveal
Pseudomonas.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for multiple myeloma diagnosed
in [**2156-2-14**], treated with thalidomide, prednisone, Decadron
and Cytoxan with refractory disease and continued myeloma.
The patient was found during this admission to have up to 22
percent of her peripheral blood smear to contain plasma
cells.  The patient was also on Procrit and Lupron.  She
received intermittent transfusions as an outpatient.  She
also received plasmapheresis, the last time being on [**2156-8-5**],
the day prior to her collapse.  Also she has history of
asthma.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Prior to massive septic shock included:
Metoprolol 150 mg b.i.d.
Nifedipine CR 30 q.day.
Allopurinol 100 mg q.day
Procrit 40,000 q.week.
Albuterol p.r.n.
Oxycodone p.r.n.

Her medications on transfer were:
Neo-Synephrine drip.
Levophed drip.
Ativan/fentanyl drips.
Vasopressin.
Sparfloxacin.
Zosyn.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On the day of admission, her vital
signs at [**Hospital1 46**] revealed temperature 104, blood pressure
84/32 on Neo-Synephrine, breathing 25, 100 percent on AC 700,
14.5, FIO2 100 percent.  On arrival at [**Hospital6 649**], her temperature was 98, her blood pressure
was 70/59, went up to 93/68, heart rate 110 on Levophed, Neo-
Synephrine and Vasopressin.  Her vent settings were AC
500/26/5/1.  Her gases on those settings were 7.19, 41, and
289 upon arrival.  At [**Hospital3 3583**], she had 7 liters in
and 500 cc out.  The patient was cyanotic, intubated,
anasarcic and non-responsive.  Her pupils were equal,
minimally reactive at 3 mm to 2 mm.  There was bleeding from
the oral and nasal mucosa.  The patient had a right IJ
placed.  She had bronchial breath sounds.  She was
tachycardic, S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  She
had hypoactive bowel sounds.  She is anasarcic.  She had
diffuse mild erythroderma and she was unresponsive.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values at [**Hospital3 3583**]
presentation:  white count 3, hematocrit 27, platelets 134.
Chem-7:  sodium 136, potassium 3.9, chloride 103, bicarb 20,
anion gap 13, BUN 24, creatinine 2.8.

At [**Hospital1 **] on [**2156-8-7**], the patient's bicarb
was 11 with an anion gap of 27.  Platelets were 64, INR was
6, with picture being compatible with DIC.  PTT was 72.5,
albumin 2.5, ALT 1719, AST 3421, compatible with shock liver.
LDH 4350.  Her total bilirubin was 2.5, troponin 0.25, MB CK
467, MB 10, consistent with a non-ST elevation MI.  Her
lactate was 12.3.

ASSESSMENT:  47 year old woman with multiple myeloma,
presented with pneumonia, Pseudomonas septic shock, with
multisystem failure, profound acidemia, anuria, shock liver,
myocardial infarction, DIC, and hypocalcemia.  Her calcium
was 5.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  HYPOTENSION SECONDARY TO GRAM-NEGATIVE
SEPTIC SHOCK:  The patient was continued on pressors and
given many liters of I.V. fluids with a goal of MAP of 60.
CVPs were followed.  An arterial line was placed and followed
as well for titration of pressors.  She was initially started
on cefepime and vancomycin.  When the Pseudomonas was
identified, she was treated with Zosyn and ciprofloxacin.
She completed a full course.  Her pressors were eventually
weaned off and she completed a course of antibiotics for her
sepsis.

OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient developed
fungemia secondary to central line, broad-spectrum
antibiotics and TPN.  All her lines were removed and
peripheral IVs were placed.  Cultures were drawn.  The
patient was started on ampicillin.  Ophthalmology consult was
done to rule out endophthalmitis.  She had TEE with no
evidence of vegetations.  After sterile blood cultures, she
had replacement of a central line.  Fungus was identified as
[**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.

The patient developed herpes, crusted lesions in her
oropharynx and nasopharynx and on her nose.  Derm was
consulted.  DFA's were sent.  Herpes virus grew out of them.
She was started on acyclovir.  Encephalitis doses were used
due to the fact that the patient was unresponsive for the
length of her hospital course and it was impossible to know
whether she was suffering from encephalitis or not.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was intubated.  She
remained intubated throughout the course of her stay.  She
remained on AC mode, unable to breathe herself.  The
ventilator was used often to help blow off the metabolic
acidosis the patient had.

METABOLIC ACIDOSIS FROM LACTATE AND RENAL FAILURE:  The
patient had CVVH and that was eventually titrated to regular
dialysis and patient was off of pressors.  CVVH was done to
correct her acidemia.  The patient also received liters of
bicarb drip in the acute episode to address her acidosis that
was not compatible with life.

HYPOTHERMIA:  The patient had a temperature of the low 90s.
Bear hugger and warmed I..V. fluids were used to support her
and get her through her hypothermia.

ANEMIA:  The patient had evidence of DIC at presentation,
also in conjunction with besides her septic shock her
myeloma, resulting in decreased production.  The patient had
also oozing of blood from her mouth and from her lines and
from other sites during her stay secondary to DIC.  She was
supported with FFP, platelet transfusions and red blood cell
transfusions.  She had greater than 20 each of platelet and
red blood cell transfusions during the course of her stay in
the FI CU.

ELEVATED LFTS SECONDARY TO SHOCK LIVER

COAGULOPATHY SECONDARY TO DIC:  The patient received, as
mentioned before, FFP, multiple units, throughout her stay
both for procedures as well as to prevent the oozing that she
had from multiple sites in her body, especially her
oropharynx.

HYPOCALCEMIA:  The patient was on a calcium drip.  This was
maintained especially during the CCVH where her hypocalcemia
became acutely worse.  This also worsened her hypothermia.

MYELOMA:  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] followed the patient regarding her
myeloma, spoke to the family on multiple episodes saying that
there was no treatment that could be offered to the patient,
given the fact that she had already had multiple treatments
without response and that she presented with multi-system
organ failure with peripheral plasma cells and was deemed not
a candidate for further
