Chief Complaint:
Germ cell tumor w/metastases to lung

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CVL placement
Bronchoscopy
Intubation
Mechanical ventilation
Aline placement

History of Present Illness:
52 yo M with PMH DM I, CAD s/p CABG x2, asthma, mental
retardation, and germ cell tumor with mestastasis to LUL
invading the pulmonary artery as well as occluding the LUL
bronchus and LLL bronchus, who presents from an OSH for possible
debulking of the metastases. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 13347**] on [**2167-6-4**] for elective bronchoscopy, which found an
endobronchial growth occluding the take-off of the LLL and most
of the LUL. During the bx, the pt had massive hemoptysis
requiring intubation. Pt was transferred to the ICU and had
electrocautery, which successfully stopped the bleeding. He had
an additional 6 biopsies, which showed germ cell tumor,
nonseminoma metastasized from the testicles. By CT scan, it
appeared that the tumor was invading the pulmonary artery as
well. Pt was extubated in the ICU after 24hrs. He had pulmonary
edema secondary to his known cardiac disease, which improved
after lasix. His course was also complicated by [**Doctor First Name 48**], that
improved with fluid down to 1.1 from 1.49. He also had SOB
during the admission, worse with lying down, with a known R
pleural effusion.
.
Pt had TTE at the OSH on [**2167-6-8**] that showed normal EF, LV
normal size but wall motion difficult to assess, mild MV
thickening, trace MR,
.
Currently,  the patient feels short of breath and has a cough,
but otherwise has no complaints. He says he's not sure of what
went on at the prior hospital. He says, "I don't know, I haven't
coughed up blood." "[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 4223**] is my doctor, and the cancer
isn't anything serious."
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

Preliminary Report !! WET READ !!
1. 38 x 41 mm left upper lobe solid mass (2:17) compatible with
known germ
cell tumor. 28 x 35 mm hilar mass (2:25) compresses a left lower
lobe
bronchiole traversing through. 2. Ground glass opacities with
intersitial
markings in a "crazy paving" pattern in the upper zones (2:21)
may reflect an inflammatory or infectious process, or
lymphangenic spread of tumor. 3.
Rounded atalectasis at the right lung base (2:33) with
inspissated dense
impacted mucus. There is an adjacent loculated large right
pleural effusion with thickened wall, which may represent a
malignant effusion with pleural metastasis. Hyperdense
pleural-based masses (2:35) are most likely drop metastases. 4.
Left axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 5. Non-specific
tiny calcifications within the spinal canal (2:23). 6. s/p CABG.



Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF MICU COURSE (MICU GREEN):
On [**2167-6-11**] he underwent flexible brochoscopy.  The bronch showed
98% occlusion of the LUL and LLL which was not amenable to
stenting.  A BAL was sent.  During the procedure he became
hypertensive to the 180s and subsequently desaturated to 78% and
was noted to be wheezing.  The procedure was stopped and he was
given nebs, lasix 40IV and nitropaste.  He had an ABG which was
7.31/78/83 and was thereafter placed on BiPAP and transferred to
the MICU.
.
In the MICU, he was placed on bipap and given an additional 80mg
IV Lasix.  He improved, was diuresed -2.5L and was weaned to
nasal canula.  His code status was confirmed to be DNR but okay
to intubate for short-term, reversible causes.  His home lasix
was changed to lasix 80mg IV BID.  His blood pressure
medications were uptitrated to obtain better blood pressure
control.  His Lisinopril was increased to 20mg daily and he was
given 1 dose of Captopril 6.25mg PO.  His outpatint oncologist
was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the inpatient heme-onc team was consulted for
plans for chemotherapy.  He has a history of hemoptysis after
bronchoscopy in the past but did not have a problem with this
while in the ICU.  He was hypoglycemic to the 40s overnight on
[**2167-6-11**] and his lantus was decreased to 10 units per day.  This
was likely from not eating during the day.
.
Given his tenuous respiratory status, he was transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to receive chemotherapy in the ICU.  According to
interventional pulmonology, there are no further options for
stenting or tumor debridement that they can offer.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course:
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was electively intubated for hypoxia and concerns
that he would not tolerate the fluid loads of chemotherapy
without positive pressure ventilation. He was emphatically DNR
and was willing to accept intubation only as a temporary
measure. He was continued on treatment for post obstructive PNA
with vancomycin, aztreonam, and metronidazole. He tolerated his
chemotherapy (C1D1 cisplatin + etoposide [**2167-6-13**]). Howevever,
on day 6 of his chemo he developed persistent nausea and
vomiting, so extubation was deferred. He was hypotensive at
times, and on and off pressors. He was started on TPN for
nutrition due to his persistent nausea and vomiting. He was
ultimately weaned off the ventilator and extubated on [**2167-6-22**].
On [**2167-6-23**] he was doing very well, and was tolerating POs and
comfortable on NC O2. His only complaint was cough. He was
called out to OMED.
.
OMED Course:
On arrival on the floor he was conversant and comfortable. He
became suddenly unresponsive and cyanotic. A Code Blue was
called. Initially there was concern for seizure, and he was
emergently given lorazepam IV. Once he was placed on a cardiac
monitor he was found to be in coarse Vfib. Given concern for
torsade de pointes magnesium was given as an IV push as
amiodarone was drawn up. However, his mother and HCP, who was in
the room for the event, asked that resusitation be halted. The
patient had been clearly DNR, and she felt that further measures
were not consistent with his goals of care. He died with his
mother at the bedside. Pastoral care and SW were called to
assist the family with the mourning process. His ICU team was
present for the
