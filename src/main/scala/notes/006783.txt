History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o.m. with who presents feeling weak today after eye
doctor's appointment.  History is obtained from ED
record/chart/pt's wife as patient is intubated.  He had been
feeling week for the past couple of days and his wife took his
pulse today and it was in the 20-30's.  She states that he
sleeps often and had a congested cough the last few nights for
which she gave cough suppressant, but otherwise he has been
doing well.  No CP, SOB, palpatations, dizziness, passing
out/LOC, PND, orthopnea, or other symptoms.  Brought him to
[**Location (un) 620**] because his HR was low.  Of note, he was recently
discharged to [**Location (un) 620**] in [**2104-1-1**] for acute on chronic
renal failure and bradycardia, and the discharge summary and
discharge medication list recommended stopping digoxin.
However, per wife, the patient has continued to take it (she was
unaware that this was to be stopped).
.
In ED at [**Location (un) 620**] vitals were 97, 29, 172/60, 96% 2L NC.  EKG
showed bradycardia at 28, V paced.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.  In our ED, HR 16, BP 180/70, 95% RA. A
magnet was placed over pacer without change in rate.  Pacer was
found to not be functioning d/t dead battery, and he was paced
externally initially and then a transvenous pacer was placed
successfully by the EP fellow.  Prior to this placement however,
he became more agitated and somnolent, and per nursing notes
became more hypoxic (no O2 sat recorded) and was placed on NRB.
He was intubated with 20mg etomidate, 120mg succinate for airway
protection.  Once intubated and pacing adequately, his SBP
elevated to 210s but came down to 160s.  Also recieved digibind
in the emergency room for mildly elevated digoxin level.
.
On review of symptoms per wife, no prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. No recent fevers, chills or rigors. Has
cough/congestion in his sleep.  No dysuria, abdominal pain, or
other symptoms.
.
Cardiac review of systems per wife is notable for absence of
chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] y.o.m. with bradycardia s/p pacer, CAD s/p CABG, HTN,
DM, CRI who presented [**3-11**] with weakness and found to have
bradycardia to 28 now s/p pacer adjustment and generator change.
.
# Rhythm
Pt was found to be ventricularly paced at 20-30 bpm (!). This
bradycardia +/- digoxin toxicty this was likely the cause of his
weakness/lethargy.  Tranvenous pacer was placed initially, then
the following morning the pt underwent pacemaker generator
change. Pt was given levofloxacin (PCN allergy) for peroperative
prophylaxis with the plan to continue for 5 days).  Digoxin was
held and not restarted since there if no need for this pt to be
on digoxin with an EF>55%.  It peaked at 2.7, perhaps
contribution from ARF and was given digibind in ED given sx's.
BB and CCB was held uopn admission, then restarted after ICD
adjustment. Pt was monitored on telemetry, staying mostly in
sinus and with a rate between 60-80.
.
# Pump:
Pt did have a recent ECHO with normal EF.  Upon presentation pt
was hypoxic in the ED and pt was intubated for airway
protection.  He was extubated the following morning, but
continued to have an oxygen requirement.  Since pt had 1+
peripheral edema and mild pulmonary edema on CXR it was thought
pt was in mild acute diastolic heart failure.  He was given 20mg
IV lasix on day 2, and 10mg IV lasix on day 3.  Pt will likely
not need long-term diuretic but should s/s of volume overload
appear should be considered.  BB and [**Last Name (un) **] were held initially; BB
re-started after ICD adjustment. [**Last Name (un) **] was held given mild acute
on chronic renal failure, but restarted upon discharge.
Isosorbide was continued.
.
# CAD s/p CABG
Pt had no signs or symptoms of ischemia.  Troponin was checked
and was at baseline in setting of CRI. EKG without changes. BB
as above.  Pt was not on ASA or statin at home.  Statin was not
started given pt age and.  ASA was started at 325mg given afib
and for secondary prevention of MI. [**Last Name (un) **] was held given mild
acute on chronic renal failure, but restarted upon discharge.
.
# HTN
Pt was hypertensive off home BP meds to 200s, and was covered
with hydral before BB and CCB restarted.  Continued HCTZ,
isosorbide, and BB, CCB restarted after ICD adjustment.  [**Last Name (un) **] was
held given mild acute on chronic renal failure, but restarted
upon discharge.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure, baseline creat 1.8-2.0
Creat peaked at 2.2.  Pt likely has chronic renal disease from
HTN and DM and had an acute worsening likely d/t dehydration in
setting of poor PO intake (sleeping more, more somnolent). Held
[**Last Name (un) **] but restarted prior to d/c.  Gentle IVFs on admission.
Creatinine 2.1 on discharge.
.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
Not on ASA or coumadin at home. Given risks/benefits was
determined to need at least ASA 325 for stroke prevention.
Unclear why pt is on digoxin given lack of indication with an
EF>55%, therefore digoxin was discontinued. B
