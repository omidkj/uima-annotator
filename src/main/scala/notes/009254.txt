Pertinent Results:
[**2139-10-20**]
ECHO:
Findings
There is a prominent (~5cm) liver cyst.
LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is moderately dilated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is mildly
dilated. There is lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial
septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There
is mild thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate [[**2-6**]+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve leaflets
appear structurally normal with physiologic pulmonic
regurgitation.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo
windows. The patient is bradycardic (HR<60bpm). Based on [**2132**]
AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data. The echocardiographic
results were reviewed by telephone with the houseofficer caring
for the patient.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened with moderate to
severe aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
mitral annular calcification leading to at lease mild functional
mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis. At least
mild functional mitral stenosis. At least mild mitral
regurgitation. Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.

Based on [**2132**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic
data.

STRESS TEST [**2139-10-20**]
PROCEDURE DATE: [**2139-10-19**]
INTERPRETATION: This is an 80 year old woman here for the
evaluation
of heart failure. The patient received .142mg/kg/min IV
Persantine over
4 minutes. There was no chest, arm, neck or back pain. There was
a LBBB
on the baseline ECG. The Persantine was reversed with 125mg
Aminophylline IV. The rhythm was sinus without ectopy. The blood
pressure and heart rate responses were appopriate for the
infusion.
IMPRESSION: No angina with uninterpretable ECG. Nuclear report
will be
sent separately.

FINAL REPORT


HISTORY: Eighty year old woman with a history of diastolic heart
failure and
flash pulmonary edema, preoperative.

SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose
of 0.142
mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m
sestamibi was
administered IV.

MIBI:
INTERPRETATION:
Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting
images.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.

Left ventricular cavity appears within normal limits.
Rest and stress perfusion images demonstrate uniform tracer
uptake, without
evidence of fixed or reversible perfusion abnormalities.

Gated wall motion images demonstrate normal wall motion.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 66%.

IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion study. Calculated EF
equals 66%.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for R/O MI, diuresis, management of ankle
fracture.  She diuresed 5 L on IV lasix.  She ruled out for MI.
She developed htn that was not responding to anti-hypertensives
and with worsening [**Month/Day/Year 7186**] of breath thought to reflect flash
pulmonary edemam.  She was transferred to the MICU for close
monitoring and maintained on 50% face mask; she was transferred
back to the floor 1 day later after further diuresis.  Her blood
pressure was better controlled on lisinopril following
aggressive diuresis.  Her medicines were adjusted to inlcude
lasix 120 po qam and lisinopril 40 mg po qd to maintain blood
pressure control.  She had an ECHO and a stress test to evaluate
cardiac function.  She had serial ankle x-rays and had a cast
placed on her ankle.  Ultimately, the orthopedic team felt her
ankle did not require surgical correction and she was discharged
with plans to follow up
