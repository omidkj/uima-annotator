Pertinent Results:
[**2134-2-1**] - ECHO
Pre-bypass:
The left atrium is normal in size. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending and descending aorta are mildly dilated. A
mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and
descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined due to the aortic dissection. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the
anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm. LVEF is globally depressed . LVEF=
35%. Mild RV hypokinesis. Mechanical valve seen in the aortic
position. Leaflets move well and the valve appears well seated.
Washing jets typical for this type of valve seen. Graft material
seen in the ascending aorta and arch.

[**2134-2-1**] CTA
1. New type A aortic dissection involving the aortic root and
extending to
the level of the descending thoracic aorta.
2. Extension of previously noted type B dissection, which now
extends to the level of the common iliacs bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 15785**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2134-2-1**] for management
of her acute type A dissection. She was taken immediately to the
operating room where she underwent a bental procedure, total
arch replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting to one
vessel. Please see operative report for details. Postoperatively
she was taken to the intensive care unit with an open chest due
to swelling. She was transfused for postoperative anemia. Over
the next few days, she was diuresed. On [**2134-2-4**], she returned to
the operating room where she underwent sternal washout and
closure. Coumadin was started for her mechanical aortic valve.
On [**2134-2-6**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 15785**] awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. On [**2134-2-8**] she was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility.
She was discharged to home on POD 10.  By the time of discharge
the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
