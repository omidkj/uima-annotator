.
[**4-2**] Echo: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mildly reduced  left ventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mildly dilated  ascending aorta.
.
[**4-2**] CXR - Dense bilateral perihilar consolidation which
progressed from [**3-29**] through [**4-1**] is now joined by
moderate pulmonary edema worsened since [**3-31**], accompanied by
increasing moderate bilateral pleural effusion. Mediastinal
contour indicates elevated central venous pressure. Lung volumes
are quite low exaggerating heart size which is probably top
normal and only slightly enlarged. No pneumothorax. Tip of the
left subclavian line projects over the junction of the
brachiocephalic veins. No indication of pneumothorax. Colonic
distention seen in the splenic flexure is unchanged over the
past several days.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  72 yo woman c T2 DM, HTN, admitted c elevated BS up to
400, metabolic acidosis c hyperkalemia , renal failure, UTI  and
respiratory failure most likely  d/2 aspiration and heart
failure.
.
#Respiratory failure- Patient was intubated at OSH after
witnessed aspiration event after receiving kayexelate.  She
remained intubated after transfer initially and was slowly
weaned off the ventilator.  Once her metabolic status was
improved, she was extubated.  Post extubation she continued to
have high oxygen requirement with one or two episodes of
desaturation.  CXR was consistent with volume overload and she
was given lasix for diuresis.  She diuresed well with IV lasix
and her O2 requirement improved.  She was also treated with
levoflox for aspiration Pneumonia.
.
# Hyperkalemia - at OSH, patient was given Calcium gluconate,
bicarb.  Renal was consulted on transfer to ICU.  They
recommended IVF and lasix, along with calcium,
bacarbinate,insulin, glucose, albuterol and kayexalate.  Her
potassium steadily improved and by the following day she was
hypokalemic.  It was unclear why patient was hyperkalemic,  not
clearly medication related.  She had elevated blood sugars on
admission and acute renal insufficiency.
.
# Renal failure- Initially her renal function improved with
aggressive iv fluids and then tapered off.  She was diresed and
her renal function improved to 1.7 on day of discharge.  Prior
to discharge she was started on Losartan.  Her potassium and
renal function should be monitored closely.
.
#  CHF- Initially given concern for infection and elevated
lactate she received aggresive IV fluids.  After high O2
requirements post extubation she was given lasix for diuresis.
Her oxygen saturation improved drastically.  Echo was done which
showed EF 40-45%.  She was also restarted on her [**Last Name (un) **] and
hydral/imdur were added for afterload reduction.  Aspirin was
continued.  Her creatinine and potassium should be monitored
daily.
.
# UTI - Urine with GPC, She received a 7 day course of
Vancomycin.
.
# T2DM - Cont SSI.  She should be restarted on her PO diabetic
regimen after discharge.
# FEN - Patient received tube feeds while she was intubated.
Post extubation she underwent a Speech and Swallow evaluation
given her history of aspiration pneumonia.  Her swallow eval was
ok and her diet was advance to po diet.
