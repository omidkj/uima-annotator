Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
? Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Removal of HD catheter

History of Present Illness:
56M ESRD:PD here w/ lethargy and low blood pressure. Pt has had
fairly difficult course with multiple failed HD access as well
as cath infections, recently started on peritoneal dialysis with
occasional HD for fluid removal. Combined HD/PD therapy has been
instituted for the last two months, which is when patient's wife
noted that he was becoming relatively hypotensive. USOH of this
health until ~ 2 weeks ago, developed increasing lethargy, worse
over last two days. In addition, noted to have lower BP 60s-
100s, and notably more lethargic following hemodialysis and
during hypotensive sessions. Otherwise, was told to increase
sodium intake outside of dialysis with some good effect on blood
pressure, but recurrent lower extremity edema - which is primary
measurement of fluid status.


In addition, over last two days, has developed diarrhea, as well
as nausea and vomiting today. Furthermore, low grade fever, but
no chills over last day. Otherwise, no CP, abdominal pain,
occasional shortness of breath, especially today, recent
development of non-productive cough over last day, states having
decreased appetite. Of note, did not have HD last week.

TTE [**5-9**]: EF 70%-80%, Moderate to severe [3+] TR. Moderate PA
systolic hypertension.
.
[**9-9**] MIBI: EF 59% Resting and stress perfusion images reveal a
moderate reversible inferior and inferolateral defect.
.
[**12-7**] CXR:
The heart size is borderline normal. Once again, a right
subclavian central venous line is visualized with its tip within
the distal SVC. Once again seen are multiple linear and discoid
atelectases of the left mid zone and right lung base. There
could be small bilateral pleural effusions. The lungs are
otherwise clear. The patient is noted to be status post cervical
fusion with hardware unchanged compared to previous exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
56M ESRD HD/PD, admitted with hypotension, found to have coag
negative staph line infection.
.
#ID: 1. Coag negative staph from line x 2 bottles. Sensitivities
pending. Hypotension appears to be due to dialysis rather than
sepsis. On Vanco (by level) for line infection; will continue on
Vanco IP 2 grams with PD by level as an outpatient for a 2 week
course (goal trough 15-20).

2. PNA- The patient was thought to possibly have pneumonia by
CXR, as well as a new O2 requirement and cough; therefore he was
initially treated empircally with levofloxacin then ceftriaxone
([**Date range (1) 101716**]).  However, repeat CXR was not suggestive of PNA;
pt's pulmonary symptoms most likely due to volume overload;
therefore ceftriaxone was discontinued. At discharge the patient
was satting 91% on room air.  [**Female First Name (un) **] team is deferring possible
pulmonary function tests to his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] his long history of
smoking.
.
# Hypotension/lethergy- likely due to intravascular volume
depletion (despite total body fluid overload); correlates with
timing of peritoneal dialysis.  SBP at home reportedly as low as
60's (per pt's wife); during hospitalization SBP ranged from
75-130's.  Pt feeling better overall at the time of discharge,
with systolic blood pressure of 100-110.
.
* ESRD: Continue peritoneal dialysis, renal meds per renal. Pt
on transplant list.
.
* Mental status: Etiology of recent MS changes unclear, ddx
includes Uremia, infection, hypotension; some improvement with
improvement in SBP to >80 per patient's wife.  Currently at
baseline upone discharge.
.
* h/o DVT- anticoagulated on Coumadin 5mg,  follow INR.
.
* Chronic pain: Continue methadone and oxycodone.
.
* FEN: Renal diet, PD
.
* Prophylaxis: PPI, anticoagulated
