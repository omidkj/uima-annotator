PE [**2109-10-19**]:
 ACUTE PULMONARY EMBOLISM WITH A MODERATE-TO-LARGE EMBOLUS
BURDEN AS
     ABOVE.  THERE IS EQUIVOCAL EVIDENCE FOR ELEVATED RIGHT
HEART PRESSURE
     AND RIGHT HEART STRAIN.  CORRELATION WITH ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
IS
     INDICATED

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with COPD on home O2 and recent hospitalization for
pneumonia, presenting with bilateral PE.

1. Pulmonary Embolism:  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was
switced from heparin drip to weight-based lovenox for
anticoagulation.  Monitored daily INR while titrating coumadin
dose to INR of [**2-5**].  Throughout hospital course, remained
hemodynamically stable with no signs of right ventricular strain
on EKG or exam.  Echo was deferred as results would not impact
management - patient was not a candidate for thrombolysis given
multiple comorbidities.  Although patient was initially on 100%
nonrebreather on admission, this was quickly weaned to 4LO2 NC
which is near patient's baseline.  Hospital staff stressed
importance of pulmonary toilet with incentive spirometry and
elevation of head of bead.  On discharge, INR was 2.7
This was a primary thromboembolic event, most likely provoked in
setting of recent hospitalization and immobilization at acute
rehab.  No indication to suspect clotting disorder or other
secondary causes like malignancy.  Although patient has remote
hisotry of prostate cancer, recent PSA was within normal limits.
 Therefore patient will require anticoagulation for 6 months.

2. Altered Mental Status: waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status in
MICU likely secondary to delerium with possible underlying
dementia.  Delerium multifactorial including change of
environment (ICU psychosis) and hypoxia secondary to COPD/
massive PEs.  Infectious etiology contributing to delerium not
thought to be likely (see below).  Patient had several episodes
of agitation requiring halidol.  Hospital staff were encouraged
to maintain a consistent/ normal schedule for patient to
minimize delerium.  Oxygen saturation was kept above 90%.
Throughout stay, mental status improved and at the time of
discharge he was breathing comfortably on 3 L NC.

3.  CAD: Stable, no signs of ischemia.  Patient was previously
taken off all his other cardiac medication secondary to
"intolerance"/ i.e. confusion. Continued on aspirin throughout
hospital course.

4. leukocytosis: Initial elevation in WBC to 13.1 with left
shift was likely secondary to stress reaction from recent PE.
Patient had no focal signs of infection and remained afebrile.
While CXR did show a hazy infiltrate in right lower lobe this
was felt to represent resolving consolidation from recent
pneumonia rather than active infection.  It would be prudent to
follow up the current exam with another CXR in [**4-8**] weeks to
ensure complete resolution.

5. COPD: stable, continued on nebs and home O2.

6. Code: Full code.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital 11851**] Healthcare - [**Location (un) 620**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism

Secondary Diagnosis:
COPD
CAD


Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable; breathing comfortably on 3 L NC
(baseline 2 L).


Discharge Instructions:
You initially presented with increasing shortness of breath
after a prior hospitalization for pneumonia.  A CT scan at an
outside hospital showed two large clots in the main pulmonary
blood vessels.  You were transferred to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] Medical
Center for further medical care.
We started you on a blood thinning medication called coumadin
that will prevent extension of the blood clots and worsening of
your respiratory status.  The blood levels of this drug will
need to be measured carefully to ensure that they are
appropriate for your condition (target INR [**2-5**]).  While the
medication coumadin is reaching appropriate levels, you will
need to continue the lovenox shots (another blood thinning
medication that is given in the subcutaneous tissue).  You will
need to be on blood thinning medications for 6 months.

Please continue to take your previous medications as prescribed:
In addition please take coumadin--- daily.  The rehabilitation
facility will tell you how to adjust the doses of this
medicatipn to maintain an INR of [**2-5**].

Followup Instructions:
please follow up with your primary care proivider. You will need
to have your blood drawn to check your INR within the next 3
days. You will also need follow up with your PCP as soon as you
get discharged from ReHab.
