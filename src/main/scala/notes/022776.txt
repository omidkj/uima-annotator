Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] ligation of left popliteal artery aneurysm
and
proximal superficial femoral artery to distal-above-knee
bypass graft using 6-mm ringed PTFE on [**2144-6-1**].

He was transferred to VICU post-operatively.  He triggered that
night secondary to increased O2 requirements.  Resolved with
diuresis.  Troponins were cycled and were mildly elevated.

POD #1 his Swann was taken out and he was started on plavix.  He
was given light diuresis for his CHF.

Cardiology saw him for brief run of SVT and mild troponin
elevation.  They suggested light diuresis, metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and O2
sats of 90-92%.

On POD 2 pt became agitated.  After more agitation with ativan
an abg was checked to reveal a CO2 of 96.  Pt was emergently
intubated and transferred to the icu.
There he became hypotensive and required neo.  This was weaned
off by morning.

He received a bronchoscopy on POD 3 whcih revealed copious thick
green secretions in the ETT but the lower airways were
relatively clear.  Pulmonology rec levaquin and light diuresis.


On POD #4 he was extubated, promptly failed and had to be
re-intubated.

Following this, he was weaned slowly.  He remained intubated for
the next two days again with gentle diuresis and continued
levaquin.  Citrobacter grew from the sputum cxs which was
sensitive to the levaquin.  TFs were initiated at this time.

His sedation was changed from versed fentanyl to precedex.  He
was treated with agressive chest physical therapy.  He was
extubated on POD #6 with transition to Bipap for support which
he tolerated well.

POD #7 his cordis was changed to a triple lumen. He was
tolerating 30% O2 face tent with only mild sputum production.
He was oob to a chair.  He was advanced to clears then a regular
diet.

POD # 9 he needed more fluid and was given a few boluses of 25%
albumin.  His CXR showed an effusion on the left, hemi-diaphragm
elevation which was chronic, and question of a new infiltrate.
He was re-bronched and tracheobronchomalacia was found
particularly in the left mainstem.

By POD # 10 he had completed his course of antibiotics.  His
respiratory status was still marginal so he was kept in the icu
another day.

On pod # 11 he was febrile, cultured and restarted on levaquin.
Beta-blockers were increased for heart rates around 100.  He was
transferred to the floor.  He had multiple PVCs which was
treated with electrolyte repletement.
POD 12 his central line was taken out.  Today he was cleared for
home by PT.
