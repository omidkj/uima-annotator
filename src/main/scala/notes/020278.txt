History of Present Illness:
64 yo male w/ h/o three vessel coronary artery disease (denied
cabg), s/p lad and rca stenting [**4-30**] presenting with increasing
dyspnea.  The pt. was brought by EMS to [**Location (un) **] ED where he was
intubated for hypercapnea (ABG 7.1/72/172); he had CXR w/ CHF;
ST depressions on ECG in V3-V6 and negative cardiac enzymes x1.

Echo [**2113-8-14**]
1.normal left atrium size.  2.normal Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis with more marked anterior and lateral
hypokinesis.. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (EF 40-45%).  3. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal.  4. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. 5.The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the findings
of the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of [**2113-4-20**],
the overall LV function is unchanged.

PTCA [**2113-8-15**]:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated three
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no angiographically

apparent, flow-limiting coronary artery disease. The LAD had a
widely
patent stent and a totally occluded D2 branch. The LCx was
totally
occluded proximally. The RCA had serial 90% lesions in the r-PDA
with
mild diffuse disease in the midvessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed central hypertension
while on
nitroglycerin IV with sedation. Opening blood pressure was
152/76 mm Hg.
3. Successful stenting of the r-PDA with two overlapping 2.5 x
12 mm
S660 stents deployed at 16 ATM each in a very tortuous vessel.
Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the areas of the
stent,
angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow. There was
loss of
the very distal, small caliber r-PDA noted at the end of the
procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo male w/ h/o 3VD, s/p stenting to mid and distal RCA and
proximal [**Hospital 54969**] transferred from outside hospital with CHF, ST
Depressions in V3-V6, first set of enzymes negative, s/p
intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

1.  CAD-The patient's EKG changes resolved on admission to the
ICU.  He was weaned off pressors.  He was thought to have
suffered from subendocardial ischemia in the setting of a CHF
exacerbation.  He had an echo which showed mildly depressed left
ventricular function.  He then underwent coronary angiography
and stenting of a severely diseased right proximal descending
artery that was complicated by a small cutoff in the distal
small right PDA.  The patient subsequently developed chest pain
with radiation down his right shoulder and arm and had
elevations in his cardiac enzymes.  A chest CT without contrast
(secondary to renal insufficiency) was done to grossly rule out
post-procedural dissection, for which there was a low suspicion.
 His symptoms were believed to be secondary to an infarction in
the territory supplied by the distal r-PDA.  The infarction was
managed medically as the area of occlusion was too small to be
revascularized.  The patient eventually was pain free and his
enzymes began to trend down again by the time of discharge.

2.  Respiratory failure-The patient was quickly and without
complications weaned off pressors, sedation, and intubation.

3.  CHF-the patient was diuresed over 3.5 liters during his
admission and became and remained euvolemic for the remainder of
his hospital stay.  His echo showed mildly depressed left
ventricular function, with mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis with more marked anterior and lateral hypokinesis.
Overall, the echo was thought to be unchanged when compared with
the findings of the prior report of [**2113-4-20**].  He was given
nutritional counseling.

4.  Hypertension-After the patient was weaned off pressors and
extubated, the patient returned to a hypertensive state, for
which he was maintained on titrated doses of metoprolol and
captopril.

5.  Arrythmia-the patient experienced an episode of atrial
fibrillation with aberrancy during the time he was ruling in for
an acute MI.  He was otherwise in mainly in normal sinus rhythm
and asymptomatic during the admission.

6.  ?Pneumonia-the patient was started on levaquin for a
possible left lower lobe infiltrate seen on his initial chest
xray.  He remained afebrile and this was later thought to be
atelectasis on CT.  He was using incentive spirometry,
ambulating and saturating well at discharge.

6.  Hematuria-The patient developed hematuria after his foley
was removed.  A urinalysis and urine culture were consistent
with urinary tract infection and he was maintained on Levaquin
for this reason.

7.  Renal insufficiency-The patient's creatinine was elevated
throughout his admission, although it was unclear as to what his
baseline creatinine was.  As a precaution, he was given mucomyst
and maintained on good hydration to counteract the nephrotoxic
effects of dye load while hospitalized.  His creatinine peaked
at 2.0 early on in the hospitalization and trended downward and
stabilized around 1.3 at discharge.

8.  Gout-The patient experience a flare of his gout in the R 2nd
MTP while admitted.  He was treated hydration and NSAIDS with
good resolution.

9.  Emphysema-Post extubation, he was given oxygen via nasal
canula and nebulizers prn for his copd.  He was counseled on
smoking cessation.
