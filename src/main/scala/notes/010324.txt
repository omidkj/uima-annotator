IMAGING:
ADMISSION CXR:
Low lung volumes, which limits assessment of the lung
parenchyma.
Continued right paramediastinal radiation fibrotic changes with
evidence of marked volume loss in the right lung. Ill-defined
hazy opacities in the upper lobe may reflect development of an
infectious process. Consider repeat radiographs with deeper
inspiration when the patient's condition has improved.

[**2111-9-1**] CTA CHEST:
1. No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or aortic aneurysm.

2. Extensive peribronchovascular ground-glass opacities with
refluxing of
contrast into the IVC, suggestive of pulmonary edema from
cardiac failure.
Differential considerations also include infection, drug
reaction, or possibly hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Follow up
imaging after diuresis is recommended for further evaluation.
3. Small right pleural effusion, increased.
4. Right paramediastinal radiation changes on a background of
pulmonary
fibrosis, similar to prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84761**] is a 73 year old male with history of stage III
squamous lung cancer s/p chemotherapy and right-sided radiation,
COPD, atrial fibrillation and CHF.  He was admitted with
worsening hypoxia in the setting of a subacute decompensation
over the last few weeks.  CTA chest was notable for extensive
peribronchovascular ground-glass opacities bilaterally in
addition to known prior right paramediastinal radiation changes.
 On admission, he was offered a bronchoscopy for further
diagnosis, but he deferred after a discussion with his family
because of concern for difficulty weaning from the ventillator
after the procedure.  He was empirically given vanocmycin and
levofloxacin starting on [**2111-9-1**] to treat a pneumonia.  Pulse
dose Solumedrol 250 mg IV Q6 were started on [**2111-9-2**] for concern
for an inflammatory pneumonitis for three days and titrated to
daily prednisone.  Bactrim DS three tabs TID was started on
[**2111-9-2**] as well for possible PCP pneumonia that could not be
excluded in the absence of a bronchoscopy.  He was also diruesed
with lasix 20 mg IV PRN because he was mildy volume overloaded
on admission.

He did well for several days on high flow mask and nasal
cannula, but his oxygen requirement continued to increase
overnight from [**9-3**] to [**2111-9-4**] requiring non-invasive
ventillation.  ABG showed a combined metabolic and respiratory
alkalosis (7.51/40/62 on 95% high flow and 6L NCO2). He was
weaned from non-invasive ventilation [**2111-9-4**] yet required high
flow mask ranging from 80%-95% oxygen. He would immediately
desaturate once the oxygen was removed. The interventions
pursued did not improve the patient's oxygen requirement. After
extensive discussion with the patient and family, it was
ultimately decided to make the patient comfort measures only as
his respiratory status was not expected to improve. He was
started on a morphine gtt and passed away 7:58 AM [**2111-9-9**]. Cause
of death was radiation pneumonitis with immediate cause ARDS.
The family declined an autopsy.

He was on flecainide for atrial fibrillation, but this was
discontinued on admission because he was not in sinus and there
was concern flecainide may have contributed to progression of
his lung process.

He was on warfarin for atrial fibrillation, which was held on
admission for INR 4.1.  He continued to have a rising INR (max
to 17.1) while on levofloxacin and with poor PO intake.  There
was no evidence of bleeding complications.  LFT's and DIC labs
were normal.
