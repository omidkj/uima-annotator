Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Digoxin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, tachycardia, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Continued ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 82 yo female with atrial fibrillation, HTN, amiodarone
induced hyperthyroidism, s/p trach/peg and chronically vented,
who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation with shortness of
breath, tachycardia, and fever to 103.

Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (3) 95595**] with pneumonia from
likely rhinovirus with bacterial superinfection. She was treated
with appropriate antibiotics and steroid course. She was
intubated initially and had difficulty weaning from the vent and
thus underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement. The above was
further complicated by likely ventilator associated pneumonia.
Additionally, the patient, who has tachy-brady syndrome, had
many episodes of afib/flutter and RVR with aberrancy (and rate
related LBBB). This was controlled with beta blockade. Her
amiodarone was discontinued as it caused hyperthyroidism.
Additionally, digoxin at that time led to bradycardia.
Endocrinology followed Ms. [**Known lastname 95596**] for her amiodarone-induced
hyperthyroidism and a slow prednisone taper was planned.

Per review of records from [**Name (NI) **], pt was on trach mask for
three days but was desaturating to 68% on 100 % trach mask. She
was connected back to the vent. Also, per report secretions for
4-5 days but noticed to have frank bleeding since yesterday
afternoon. Cultures from [**2160-4-3**] show >100,000 Vancomycin
resistant enterococcus faecolis (sensitive to Linezolid) and
>100,000 Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA) (sensitive
to linezolid). Also with sputum from [**2160-4-3**] growing pseudomonas
aeruginosa (sensitive to zosyn MIC 64, and gentamicin MIC 4).

At 8:30 pm last night, HR to 140s-150s (SVT). She received IV
metoprolol 5 mg x 4 without effect. She also received 6 mg of
adenosine x1 and then 12 mg of adenosine, and broke into sinus
tachycardia briefly.

In the ED, VS on arrival were: T: 103, HR: 127. BP: 90/43; RR:
37; O2: 100 on 400/12/100/8. She was given 650 mg acetaminophen
pr, 1 gram of vancomycin IV, 1 gram of ceftazidime IV, and 10 mg
of dexamethasone. She also received 40 meq of potassium chloride
and 500 mg IV metronidazole. Also given 3 L NS with improvement
of BP. EKG showed afib with LBBB, shown to cardiology.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 82 yo female with atrial fibrillation, HTN, amiodarone
induced hyperthyroidism, s/p trach/peg and chronically vented,
who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation with SOB, fever, and
tachycardia. Sputum from [**Hospital1 **] grew out pseudomonas.

1. Respiratory [**Name (NI) 37370**] Pt was on a trach mask for three days
prior to decompensation. The current respiratory failure is
likely secondary to a ventilatory associated pneumonia. Sputum
from [**Hospital1 **] grew out pseudomonas, sensitive to gentamycin (MIC
4) and Zosyn (MIC 64) only. We started patient on gentamycin and
zosyn for a planned 14 day course (to end on [**4-17**]). Pt was able
to be changed to pressure support on HD1 and tolerated that for
a few hours. HD 2, pt had tachypnea after a few minutes on
pressure support. On hospital day 3 changed to pressure support
and then tolerated trach mask with out need for vent.  Would
consider adding inhaled tobramycin once IV antibiotics are
complete for ten more days until she is decannulated.

2. Fever/leukocytosis- Pt has urine growing MRSA and VRE from
[**Hospital1 **]. Additionally sputum growing pseudomonas as above. Will
treat pseudomonal infection as above and UTI with linezolid x 14
days (last dose 5/31). Panculture data is as above.
Additionally, pt has bilateral pleural effusions. Given the
multiple likely etiologies for fever, and the fact that the
pleural effusions are bilateral, they were not tapped.  Her
fever resolved with antibiotics and her leukocytosis slowly
trended down.  She should have a repeat urine culture after her
course is complete to ensure resolution of infection.

3. Tachycardia/ atrial fibrillation- Patient has known
tachy-brady syndrome with history of SVT with aberrancy.  We
continued her metoprolol q6 hours with holding parameters and
monitored her on telemetry. Initial component of tachycardia was
secondary to hypovolemia which was corrected with IVF on
admission.
In terms of anticoagulation, INR was 4.4 on admission which
drifted down. Given guaiac positive stools and anemia, pt's
outpatient cardiologist was emailed who is conteplating the
necessity of anticoagulation for the paf. Coumadin was restarted
at time of discharge. Needs outpatient GI work up.

4. Amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism-on prednisone 5 mg po qday
as outpatient. The steroids were increased to hydrocortisone 50
mg q6 hours initially and changed back to rehab dose steroids on
HD 3. TSh and T4 were rechecked and were normal.

5. Anxiety- alprazolam prn and Quetiapine qhs were continued.

6. LLE swelling- mildlower extremity swelling L>R. LENIs were
negative for clot. Neurology saw patient for LLE pain/weakness
and thought that her exam was most l
