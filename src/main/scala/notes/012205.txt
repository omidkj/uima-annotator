Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Endotracheal intubation
Left central line placement
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 yo woman with h/o moderate AS (aortic valve
area of 1.2 cm2), complete heart block s/p PMP, DM2, HTN, and
HL, who presented from home with shortness of breath. Per the
patient's family, she was in her normal state of health until
approximately 4 days ago, when she developed a cough and
worsening congestion, which was thought to be an upper
respiratory infection. She started taking Mucinex last night,
which did not improve her symptoms. Overnight, she did not wear
her BiPap, as she did not want to mess up her hair for Mother's
Day. At 3 am this morning, she acutely developed shortness of
breath. EMS was called and she was brought to the ED for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, her initial VS were P 123, BP 183/93, R 36, O2 64% on
NRB. She was urgently intubated (difficult airway, placed over a
bougie) and was started on a nitro gtt for her hypertension. Her
SBP then acute dropped to the 50s in the setting of the nitro
gtt, so she was given 1L of NS. Two CVLs were placed (subclavian
and femoral, each requiring multiple sticks) and she was started
on Levophed. She had a bedside TTE, which showed poor LV
contraction (prior EF 55%), so she was given ASA 325 mg. She
then spiked a fever to 102, and WBC was elevated at 17, so she
was cultured and was started on CTX, Levoquin, and Vancomycin
for presumed sepsis. CXR at that time was consistent with
pulmonary edema without evidence of an obvious infiltrate. EKG
showed LAD with V-pacing spikes. Given the concern for flash
pulmonary edema in the setting of septic shock, she was admitted
to the CCU for further evaluation. Her VS at the time of
transfer were T 102, P 66, R 20, BP 125/38.

In the CCU, the patient was initally given Ethacrynic acid 50 mg
IV for presumed flash pulmonary edema and her respiratory status
improved. She then becamse febrile to 104 and required both IVFs
and Levophed for hemodynamic support. Her blood pressures were
incredibly labile, ranging from 60s to 240s systolic with
minimal support. It was eventually determined that her blood
pressure was heart-rate dependant, and she was unable to hold a
stable blood pressure with a rate of < 70. Her pacemaker was
thus adjusted to a rate of 70, and she was weaned off pressors
on [**3-31**]. She had significant anxiety when weaning from the
ventilator, so she was started on Seroquel 25 mg PO BID for
agitation. Despite this, during her PST/RSBI on [**3-31**], she
developed hypercarbia and was unable to be extubated. Given
concern for an underlying respiratory etiology, she underwent a
CT scan, which demonstrated bibasilar opacities, concerning for
PNA. She also had a viral DFA, which returned as positive for
parainfluenza 3. Given her ongoing respiratory issues, she was
transferred to the MICU for further evaluation.

STUDIES:
[**3-29**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia with atrial sensing and ventricular
pacing. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2111-2-11**] atrial
pacing is no longer present.
.
[**3-29**] CXR: 1. Likely asymmetrical edema, but follow up radiograph
after diuresis is recommened to ensure resolution of these
findings and to exclude pneumonia.
2. Satisfactory ET tube positioning.
3. Right hemidiaphragm elevation, which was present by report on
prior Atrius studies. Small right effusion or pleural
thickening.
.
[**3-30**] Echo: Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is elongated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
