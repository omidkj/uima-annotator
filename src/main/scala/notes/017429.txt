HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year old male with
end-stage human immunodeficiency virus, acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome with a multi-drug resistant
organism and a CD4 count of 59 who presented with epistaxis
and altered mental status.  The patient was admitted to a
hospital in [**State 108**] from [**11-17**], to [**Month (only) 1096**] with dyspnea
and weakness and found to have an ejection fraction of 25%.
It was at that time he was started on Lasix and Aldactone.
He was readmitted in [**2189-12-10**] and had a complicated
Intensive Care Unit course requiring tracheostomy and
hemodialysis for acute renal failure.  He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**2190-1-18**], where he was weaned
off of the ventilator.  His tracheostomy was removed.  He was
also treated at that time for Vancomycin-resistant bacteremia
and pseudomonal pneumonia and a chronic diarrhea without a
clear source.  His renal failure resolved to the point where
he no longer required hemodialysis and he was transferred to
[**Hospital3 4419**] on [**2190-2-3**].  While at
rehabilitation he developed an acute episode of epistaxis and
it was unable to be stopped with ice and compression.  In
addition he had altered mental status which was difficult to
assess on top of his baseline human immunodeficiency virus
dementia.  He was sent to the Emergency Department for
treatment of his acute anemia.  While in the Emergency
Department, he developed hypotension with systolic blood
pressure in the 70s which did not respond to aggressive
intravenous fluid hydration and he was started on Dopamine
for pressure support and transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage human immunodeficiency virus
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, CD4 count of 59, viral
load greater than 100,000.  He was diagnosed in [**2175**], failed
multiple heart regimens.  He had Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia in [**2181**].  Type 2 diabetes.  Acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome-related lymphoma, status post CHOP
with six cycles in [**2184**] and intrathecal Cytarabine, human
immunodeficiency virus cardiomyopathy with an ejection
fraction of 25%, pancytopenia, status post appendectomy,
status post tonsillectomy, depression, history of fatty
liver, history of Clostridium difficile colitis, recent
history of acute renal failure requiring temporary
hemodialysis.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa causes a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Neurontin 100 mg t.i.d., Opium 1
ml t.i.d., Ativan 1 mg q. 4 hours prn, Neupogen 480 q. day,
magnesium oxide 400 q.i.d., Loperamide 1 to 2 mg q. 4 hours
prn, Klonopin 0.25 q. AM, Azithromycin 1250 mg q. Monday,
Bactrim single strength daily, Coreg 50 b.i.d., Protonix 40
daily, sodium bicarbonate 250 t.i.d., NPH insulin 5 units q.
AM.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother had leukemia.  Father died of a
cerebrovascular accident.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient drinks one to two drinks per
week, smoked three packs per day for 20 years, quit smoking
ten years ago.  He has lived with his partner of 40 years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.3, heart rate 98, blood
pressure 80/44, respiratory rate 16, on oxygen saturation
100% room air.  General:  Chronically ill-appearing man,
cachectic, frequently screaming, redirectable, though
confused.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Left nares
filled with blood and clot, no active bleeding, right nares
without evidence of bleeding.  Pupils, pinpoint bilaterally.
Extraocular muscles intact.  Dry mucosal membranes.  Supple
neck, no lymphadenopathy.  Evidence of prior tracheostomy.
Chest, crackles at the left base, decreased breath sounds at
the right base.  Left chest, tunnel catheter for hemodialysis
without evidence of infection.  Cardiovascular examination,
tachycardiac, loud S2, no murmurs appreciated.  Abdomen,
soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, guaiac
negative stool.  Extremities, no lower extremity edema.
Calf, muscle wasting, skin, warm and dry.  Neurological
examination, oriented to self, place "[**Hospital3 **]" and year.
Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact.  Positive
asterixes, moves all four extremities, but not cooperative
with examination.  Skin, Stage 1 decubitus ulcer over the
sacrum, no signs or symptoms of infection.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7, hematocrit with a
drop to 26 from 29 down to 21, platelets 70, MCV 92, sodium
138, potassium 3.9, bicarbonate 19, BUN 34, creatinine 1.3,
ALT 38, AST 76.  Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure,
new right upper lobe nodular density.  Computerized
tomography scan of the sinuses revealed no obvious neoplastic
source for the epistaxis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Epistaxis - The patient was seen by
Otorhinolaryngology in the Emergency Department.  There was
no evidence of posterior pharyngeal or posterior nasal
bleeding.  Silver nitrate and topical cocaine were applied in
the Emergency Department, and the bleeding stopped.  However,
secondary to his acute anemia, the patient required blood
transfusion with 3 units of packed red blood cells.  He also
received six packs of platelets in the Emergency Department
for his acute anemia in the setting of thrombocytopenia.

2.  Hypertension - The patient was transiently placed on
Dopamine for pressure support when his hypertension did not
respond to fluid resuscitation in the Emergency Department.
He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit over night
for hemodynamic monitoring.  The patient was quickly weaned
off of Dopamine the following day and was transferred to the
floor.

3.  Congestive heart failure - Several hours after being
transferred to the floor the patient developed acute
respiratory distress with hypoxia.  At that time his oxygen
saturation was in the mid 80s on room air.  He was tachypneic
with a respiratory rate of approximately 50.  He had clinical
evidence for congestive heart failure and flash pulmonary
edema, and appeared to be in a combined cardiogenic and
septic shock.  The patient was at that time treated for both
with a progressive diuresis, nitroglycerin and morphine.  In
addition he was dosed with Zosyn and Vancomycin for potential
nosocomial infections of either a pulmonary or a
gastrointestinal source.  After approximately 36 hours, the
patient had diuresed and his respiratory status slowly
improved.  The patient no longer required intravenous Lasix
and he was started on Metronidazole to treat a Clostridium
difficile infection.

4.  Clostridium difficile infection - The patient will be
discharged on a course of oral Metronidazole to treat his
Clostridium difficile infection.  He will take an additional
ten days to complete a 14 day course.

5.  Code status/goals of care - The patient had multi-drug
resistant human immunodeficiency virus with human
immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome-related lymphoma and cardiomyopathy.  After multiple
discussions with the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 108665**], the medical team, social work and case
management, the goals of care were shifted to comfort
measures.  It was felt that the patient's life expectancy was
less than six months at this time and that he would not
benefit from aggressive treatment.  The patient will be
treated with oral morphine and Ativan for comfort and
agitation, and will complete a course of antibiotic treatment
for Clostridium difficile infection.  He will be discharged
to a hospice facility or a skilled nursing facility with
hospice benefit.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair with life expectancy of four to
six months.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To hospice or skilled nursing facility
with hospice benefits.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Please follow with primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**] if you have any
questions.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  End-stage human immunodeficiency virus.
2.  Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
3.  Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related lymphoma.
4.  Human immunodeficienc
