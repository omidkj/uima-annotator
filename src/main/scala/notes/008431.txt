ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Status post coronary artery bypass graft x3 with mitral
valve repair.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 64-year-old man,
who has had a six month history of progressive congestive
heart failure symptoms.  These symptoms include fatigue,
shortness of breath, coughing, orthopnea.  He had been
treated by his primary care provider for bronchitis several
days and was on and off of antibiotics.  Although he had some
improvement in his symptoms, he noticed a worsening without
resolution in [**Month (only) 116**].

Patient had recent testing including an electrocardiogram
consistent with inferior and anterior myocardial infarct.
Pulmonary function testing ([**2175-6-6**]) revealing moderate
restrictive disease.  Chest x-ray ([**2175-5-29**]) demonstrated
mild congestive heart failure.  Recent echocardiogram, by
report, showed an ejection fraction of approximately 15%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypercholesterolemia.
2. Diabetes mellitus new diagnosis.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. Chronic knee problems.
5. Cardiomyopathy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Tonsillectomy.
2. Nasal passage surgery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg q day.
2. Captopril 12.5 mg tid.
3. Lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
4. Lipitor 10 mg q day.
5. Albuterol prn.
6. Advair one puff [**Hospital1 **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Generally, appears
unwell.  HEENT is normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive
to light.  Neck is supple, midline with no masses or
lymphadenopathy.  Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally
with some crackles at the bases.  Cardiovascular is regular,
rate, and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen
is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities are warm,
noncyanotic with some 2+ pedal edema bilaterally.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  Complete blood count is
9.8/48.6/369.  Chemistries:  140/5.3/101/30/29/1.3.  INR is
1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was initially admitted to the Heart
Failure team for evaluation and workup of his congestive
heart failure.  He was diuresed appropriately and placed on
ACE inhibitors as well as a Natrecor drip.  Patient was
concomitantly worked up for possible cardiac surgery.  This
included a transplant evaluation.  Patient did undergo
cardiac catheterization on [**2175-6-12**], which revealed three
vessel disease and an ejection fraction of approximately 15%.

Patient was diuresed appropriately out of his congestive
heart failure.  He was stable on the floor and awaited
surgical intervention.

On [**2175-6-19**], the patient was taken to the operating room and
had a coronary artery bypass graft x3 and mitral valve repair
with LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to the OM-2,
saphenous vein graft to the RDA, and annuloplasty ring.  For
details of this procedure, please see the previously dictated
operative note.  Subsequent to his surgery, the patient was
transferred to the CSRU Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.  He was
extubated on the evening of postoperative day #0 and bolused
500 cc of normal saline x2 for low central venous pressures.
The patient was maintained on low dose dopamine drip,
milrinone, as well as Neo-Synephrine.

On postoperative day #2, the patient underwent a brief run of
atrial fibrillation and was converted with amiodarone into
normal sinus rhythm.  He remained on his milrinone drip for a
low cardiac index with large quantity of fluid resuscitation
around the time of surgery, the patient was felt to be in
congestive heart failure, and in consultation with the Heart
Failure service, Lasix was begun as well as the Natrecor
drip.

Patient had another episode of rapid atrial fibrillation on
the evening of postoperative day #2, which is converted with
amiodarone 150 mg boluses x2.  Patient had another episode of
A-flutter versus fibrillation on postoperative day #3, and
then was converted with amiodarone bolusing.

The patient was seen to be diuresing well at this time.
Through his Intensive Care Unit stay, the milrinone was kept
on and slowly weaned off.  As the patient diuresed, he seemed
to be doing better.  Anticoagulation with Coumadin was begun
on postoperative day #7 given his history of multiple
episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation.  ACE inhibitors were
begun for afterload reduction.

On postoperative day #9, the patient was transferred to the
floor.  Patient's floor hospital course was essentially
unremarkable.  His glucose and diabetes management was done
in consultation with [**Last Name (un) **].  He was kept in house for
anticoagulation.  Ultimately, the patient was discharged on
postoperative day #13 tolerating a regular diet, and adequate
pain control on po pain medications, and having no more
episodes of atrial fibrillation.  He was cleared for
discharge by Physical Therapy, and with an INR of 1.9.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable, INR of 1.9.

DISPOSITION:  Home.

DIET:  Diabetic and cardiac diet.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Lasix 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] x10 days.
2. Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].
3. Aspirin 81 mg q day.
4. Percocet 5/325 [**11-17**] q4h prn.
5. Lipitor 40 mg q day.
6. Amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **].
7. Lisinopril 10 mg q day.
8. Toprol XL 25 mg q day.
9. Potassium chloride 20 mEq q day x10 days.
10. Serevent discus 50 mcg one puff q12.
11. Flovent 110 mcg two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
12. Coumadin 2.5 mg alternating with 5 mg q day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to followup in the
day after discharge for an INR check with his primary care
provider.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been arranged.  He should follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks.  No heavy lifting, strenuous
activities.  Continue ambulation and incentive spirometry.
The patient should also follow up with his cardiologist
within one week for adjustment of cardiac medications and
assessment of his heart function at that time.
