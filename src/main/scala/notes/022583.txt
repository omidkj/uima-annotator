[**2199-3-6**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS - No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF45-50%). There is a small apical aneurysm. The apex and
distal inferior walls are akinetic.The remaining left
ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. POST-BYPASS - Bivenrticular
systolic function remains unchanged from prebypass. No changes
in other exam findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. Workup was
unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery. The following day,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
Operative course was notable for another episode of Torsade
which again responded to Magnesium.  For additonal surgical
detail, please see dictated operative note. Given inpatient stay
prior to surgery was greater than 24 hours, he was given
Vancomycin for perioperative antibiotic coverage. Following the
operation, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. Given ventricular arrhythmias, the
electrophysiology service was consulted and it was recommended
that an AICD be placed.  On [**3-7**] the AICD was placed.  It was
interogated on the following day without complication.   He was
transferred to the surgical step down floor. His chest tubes and
epicardial wires were removed.  His beta blockade was increased
as tolerated and he was gently diuresed.  He was seen in
consultation by the physcial therapy service. By post-operative
day six he was ready for discahrge to home.
