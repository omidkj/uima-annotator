[**2167-1-8**] CXR-Patchy new opacity within the superior segment of the
left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia.
[**2167-1-8**] ECG-Sinus rhythm, Long QTc interval, Probable
anteroseptal infarct, age indeterminate, Low QRS voltages in
limb leads
Since previous tracing, no significant change
[**2167-1-9**] CT Head- No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
[**2167-1-9**] ECHO- 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed.  EF 50%
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2165-10-3**], LV function has decreased.
[**2167-1-11**] CT Chest- 1. Extensive multifocal ground glass opacities
bilaterally. The rapid course of development compared to the
recent chest-xrays favours pulmonary edema. However, lack of
siginficant pleural effuions and upper lobe involvement argues
against pulmonary edema. Other considerations include atypical
infection and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
2. Mediastinal lymph nodes.
3. Left lower lobe and right lower lobe areas of consolidation
could represent pneumonia or aspiration.
[**2167-1-12**] CTA Chest- No evidence of pulmonary embolus. No interval
change in bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities, bibasilar
patchy consolidation, small left pleural effusion, and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy
[**2167-1-17**] MRI Head- Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of
slowed diffusion to indicate acute infarct. No evidence of mass
effect or midline shift are seen. Subtle right frontal
hyperintensities are unchanged from the previous study of
[**2165-7-14**] and [**2165-10-5**], and could be due to a chronic right
frontal cortical infarct or changes of small vessel disease.
There is no evidence of new infarct identified. The suprasellar
and craniocervical regions are normal in the sagittal images.




Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB/Respiratory Failure-Pt initially presented with SOB and
mental status changes.  She was empirically started on
Lecofloxacin for possible PNA. DFA's were negative.  However
there was also concern that her resp status could be effected by
HF, PE, and/or COPD flare.  She had no improvement and give her
recent hosp stays was added gent and vanco for broad coverage.
Despite this she continued to worsen.  She continued to have
periods of hypoxia with fever.  blood and urine cultures were
negaitve.  She worsened with interstitial pattern on CXR and
increased wheezing.  Pt then had episode of sever hypoxia and
required NIMV and was sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for BiPAP.  There viral
culture demonstarted parainfluenza.  They also checked CTA which
ruled out any evidence of PE.  Because it was felt the virus was
also causing a COPD flare she was on steroids and responded well
and were tapered slowly.  She then returned to the florr and did
well until she had second decompensation after dialysis with
hypoxia.  She once again required short admission to the MICU
for observation.  Once again a CTA was negaitve for PE.  She was
continued on steroids and completed a 14 day course of
levo/gent/vanco for presumed super infection.  After second ICU
stay returned to the floor and was afebrile, no leukocytosis.
Slowly was weaned off of O2,  Started on MDI for COPD.  On
discharge she was ambulating without supplemental O2 and
maintaining sats.  Sent home on steroid taper with MDI's.

# Visual Changes- Complained of right eye visual problems.  [**Name (NI) **]
by ophtho.  Got MRI head which did not show any stroke or signs
of optic neuritis.  Visual problems felt to be [**2-4**] vasculopathy
(retinal artery ischemia) associated with HTN, diabetes.
Recommmended optimizing regimens for these chronic illnesses.

# DM- Insulin pump was stopped intially and she was started on
lantus and RISS.  She was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] throughout here
stay.  Insulin regimen was adjusted accordingly.  She remained
on this regimen until discharge when her pump was restarted.

# CAD-Pt presented with SOB .  Trop elavated to 3.00 when
baseline had been 0.04, without any significant ECG changes.
She was seen by cardilogy who felt she had  NSTEMI likely [**2-4**]
demand ischemia/[**Month/Day (2) **] failure and recommended optimizing medical
management.  Concern for some myositis [**2-4**] statin so this was
held.  She remained CP free during stay and troponin trended
down.  CShe was continued on BB, aspirin, plavix, imdur, ACEI

# CHF- ECHO done in house showed EF of 50% with mild global
hypokinesis.
