Service: Medicine
The patient is a 66-year-old white female, poor historian
with a past medical history significant for Alzheimer's
dementia, asthma, coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction, trigeminal neuralgia, status post
recent trigeminal release requiring left craniotomy on
of a two day history of short of breath and a cough and a one
week history of malaise.  In addition she had right arm
tenderness and swelling at an old intravenous site.  She
denied short of breath, cough, chest pain, palpitations,
nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, diarrhea, constipation or
headache.  She did complain of a decreased appetite and
decreased p.o. intake at home.  In the emergency department
dropped from 190 to 60 and she was started on Dopamine drip
and intravenous fluids.  Initially Levaquin and Oxacillin
were given to cover her for potential urine source and for
cellulitis however, this medication was changed to Vancomycin
in the Emergency Room for broader coverage.

In addition she was found to have electrocardiogram changes
with significant ST elevation in V1 through V6 of 1 mm and in
Leads 3 and AVF.  She had Q-waves in lead V2 through V6 with
loss of RS in comparison to electrocardiogram on [**2125-8-22**].

She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further
stabilization.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Bactrim causes rash.
2.  Augmentin causes rash.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:   T-max was 130.1,
temperature 100.8, blood pressure 80 to 120's/50 to 70's.
Heart rate 100 to 110, respirations 22.

She was alert and oriented times three in moderate distress.
Her head was normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils were equally
reactive to light and accommodation.  Her neck was supple.
No evidence of jugular venous distention.  Positive
craniotomy site with scar, staples removed.  Her mucous
membranes were moist.  Her heart was regular rate and rhythm
with S1 and S2.  She had a 2 to 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without
wheezing, rhonchi or rales.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds, obese.  Her right
arm was warm and tender to palpation, edematous with erythema
surrounding old intravenous site, antecubital and extended
proximally over biceps.  Sensation was intact. Pulses intact.
No lower extremity edema.

LABS:  White blood count 12.4, left shift with neutrophils
92.3, hematocrit 88.2, platelets 391, sodium 133, potassium
2.1, chloride 89, bicarbonate 28, BUN 7, creatinine 4.6.
Glucose 129, calcium 8.5, magnesium 1.3, phosphorus 2.1,
Prothrombin time 13.2, PTT 26.8, INR 1.2.  Urinalysis was
clear.  No evidence of infection.

Chest x-ray showed a minimal opacity in her left lower lobe,
no evidence of congestive heart failure.

Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm at 98 beats per
minute, left anterior descending, normal intervals, ST
elevation in 1 mm in V1 through V6 and Lead 3 and AVF.
Q-waves in V2 through V6 with loss of R-waves compared to
[**2125-8-22**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Infectious Disease.  Initial blood cultures [**2125-8-30**] grew
gram positive cocci in clusters 4/4 bottles.  She was
continued on Vancomycin until Oxacillin sensitivities were
acquired.  She continued to spike fevers through [**2125-8-31**],
Gentamicin was started for synergy. Infectious Disease was
consulted to evaluate the patient, they recommended serial blood
cultures as well as right upper extremity ultrasound.  Ultrasound
revealed a right cephalic vein with thrombophlebitis, no evidence
of an abscess or fluid collection.  Repeat blood cultures were
negative.  She was also evaluated with a transesophageal
echocardiogram for endocarditis.  She was discharged with a PICC
line to rehabilitation in order to receive outpatient Oxacillin
for a total of 4 weeks after the last negative blood culture.

2.  Cardiac.  On [**2125-8-30**] she presented to the emergency
department with Electrocardiogram changes as noted and a
Troponin of 7.5 consistent with myocardial infarction.
Serial cardiac enzymes trended downward.  An echocardiogram
was done which revealed focal hypokinesis of the apical free
wall of the right ventricle as well as a mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, left hypokinesis of the
distal septum, inferior and apical walls.  Her ejection
fraction was noted to be 40%  Heparin was not started due to
her recent intracranial surgery however, she was placed on a
beta-blocker, Ace inhibitor and aspirin.

After three weeks from her postoperative date the plan is to
consider anti-coagulation given the upper extremity clot.

3.  Pulmonary.  The patient has a history of asthma, treated
with Theophylline and Albuterol.  She also has a history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV 1/FVC ratio
of 63%  She will continue her Theophylline and Albuterol and
start an Atrovent inhaler.

4.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrients:  On admission she had
a decrease K of 2.1, as well as decreased magnesium and
phosphate.  Her electrolytes were repleted.  She will need
her electrolytes followed as an outpatient as she will be
continued on Lasix and Theophylline.

5.  Vascular/Heme:  While in house she was evaluated by the
Vascular Surgery team and they did not feel surgical removal
of the septic thrombus would be necessary. They recommended
treatment with warm compresses to her right arm and elevation
of the arm.  She was also worked up for normocytic anemia and
iron studies are pending at the time of discharge. According to
vascular surgery the cephalic vein clot is not proximal enough to
require anticoagulation although this could still be considered.
She should have a upper extrmity ultrasound in [**2-26**] weeks to
evaluate for progression of the clot.
