Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1- S/p Right Hemicolectomy/terminal ileal resection w/ a primary
ileo-transverse colostomy with a side-to-side, functional
end-to-end stapled anastamosis ([**2154-6-27**])

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19219**] is a pleasant, 63yo M w/ a PMHx significant for
Obesity, HTN, DM2, GERD, PUD, Afib on coumadin, prior LBBB on
ECG who now presents with chronic anemia and guaiac positive
stools.  Work-up with the GI service including upper and lower
endoscopy, as well as a capsule endoscopy w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
revealed the possibility of a small bowel or cecal mass/ulcer.
This prompted a general surgery consult w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
accordingly, the patient was consented for exploration, right
hemicolectomy and exploration of the small bowel.

CYSTOGRAM ([**Numeric Identifier 34386**], [**Numeric Identifier 34387**])  [**2154-7-2**]
No evidence of contrast extravasation or fistula

CTA CHEST/ABD/PELVIS W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2154-7-3**]
11:48 AM
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Enlarged main pulmonary
artery.
2. Small bowel obstruction with a transition zone in the region
of the mid ileum.
3. Small amount of pneumoperitoneum which may be a normal
finding six days after surgery.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2154-7-3**] 9:00 AM
1. Mild cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2154-7-5**] 9:16 AM
No evidence of obstruction. No evidence of perforation


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient underwent right colectomy on [**6-27**], At the time of
operation, the patient was noted to have advanced sigmoid
diverticulitis with a phlegmon and clinical [**Last Name (un) **]-vesical
fistula.  He did well initially after surgery and even recorded
having [**12-18**] bowel movements/day. He was being prepared for
discharge but on the evening of POD#6, he developed rapid atrial
fibrillation, hypotension and the need for transfer to ICU.  CTA
chest was negative and the CT w/ IV (no oral) contrast showed no
collection/leak in the abdomen.  He did have evidence of
postoperative ileus so a nasogastric tube was inserted with
copious output. It was felt that some of his hemodynamic issues
related to dehydration from poor absorbtion of his liquid diet.
Moreover, his cardiac medications may have 'pooled' in the
gastroduodenal chyme. He was placed in the ICU for further
management.  The AFib was rate controlled and the patient was
ruled out for MI. He returned to the [**Hospital1 **] within 48hrs. He
received GI/DVT prophylaxis throughout his hospital stay. A
course by systems follows:

NEURO: Pt was A/O throughout hospital stay, pain was controlled
with PCA pump and pt. properly transitioned to PO medication
upon d/c. No other issues
PULM: The patient uses BiPap at night at baseline for sleep
apnea. BiPap held intially secondary to ileus and
gastric/intestinal distention from the BiPap. The pt. c/o not
being able to sleep secondary to not using this, but this
resolved once BiPap resumed 2 days prior to d/c. At noght, w/o
BiPap developed mild respiratory acidosis 2nd to CO2 retention,
but again this resolved. CXR showed atelectasis expected 2nd
post op, but no other acute cardiopulmonary issues throughout
hospital stay.
CV: Pt. remained in a-fib rate controlled w/ BB throughout stay.
Post-oper, as described above, pt. developed ileus and
subsequent hypotention, tachycardia. This responded to fluid and
increase in BB. His a-fib is stable and on home cardiac Rx upon
d/c.
GI/FEN: As described above. Pt had [**Doctor First Name **] for LGIB and obstruction
w/ T3N2 adenocarcinoma of cecum. Pt. developed post op ileus w/
nausea, distention, anorexia. CT on [**7-3**] was remarkable only for
transition point of ileus, no leak or other abnl. This resolved
w/ NG and supportive care. KUB prior to d/c showed no evidence
of obstruction or perf. Pt. is taking good PO and without sx
upon d/c.
Heme/Id: Pt remained afebrile and only had minor bump in WBC to
11.2 during ileus, never required Abx therapy.
GU/FEN: Mild bump in BUN/Cr during episode of ileus, likely
secondary to hypotn and hypovol, responded well to fluid and has
returned to baseline of Cr 0.9 upon D/C.
