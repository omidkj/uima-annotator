Admission Date:  [**2169-10-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-10-10**]


Service:  Neurology

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
Portuguese-speaking woman with hypertension and anemia who
presented to the [**Hospital 8**] Hospital on [**2169-10-7**] for
evaluation of a constant headache.

She apparently had not been feeling well for about ten days
with some upper respiratory infection type symptoms.  She
fell on the day prior to admission and began on the day of
admission with a subsequent headache.  We did not know any
details of the headache.

However, she did manage to walk to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital but
became increasingly sleepy and less responsive there.  The
evaluation included a head computed tomography which revealed
a right temporal bleed.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Anemia.
3.  Tuberculosis.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications included atenolol,
aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, and iron.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient had lived with her alcoholic son
until recently when he died within the past couple of weeks.
In speaking with the patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
felt that she was living in order to take care of her son.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination, the
patient was expired.  No breath sounds.  Dilated and fixed
pupils.  No reflexes.  No response to painful stimuli.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Creatinine was
2.1.  Blood urea nitrogen was 68.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
on [**2169-10-7**].  Her head computed tomography revealed
intraparenchymal, intraventricular, and subarachnoid
hemorrhages as well as a small subdural; all in the right
frontal and temporal lobe regions.

Subsequent head computed tomography scans on the two days
following admission revealed no change in the bleed.  The
patient was given Levaquin and Flagyl in the Emergency
Department as empiric treatment for a possible pneumonia
given the upper respiratory infection symptoms.  The patient
was also felt to be extremely dehydrated and was given
intravenous fluids throughout her hospitalization.

The patient became increasingly somnolent and less responsive
throughout her hospital course.  On day two of her
hospitalization, she went apneic while on the ventilator.
From there, on day three of her hospitalization, she became
unresponsive to any noxious stimuli as she had been
previously responsive to noxious stimuli on admission.

Due to renal failure, possible pneumonia, and decreasing
responsiveness of the patient (probably due to her toxic
metabolic problems), her son was called on [**2169-10-10**]
and asked to come in to discuss further management of the
patient's care.

On [**2169-10-9**] the family had already decided to make
the patient do not resuscitate/do not intubate.  The son
arrived for a discussion of further care of the patient, and
the patient passed away after becoming bradycardic.  The
patient initially had some electrocardiogram changes with the
tachycardia and some ST elevations.  Lopressor was given
empirically for heart protection and rate control, and
subsequently the patient began to be bradycardic, and then
her heart stopped.

The son was present immediately after the Neurology team came
in to discuss the situation with the son, and the son said no
to the question of a possible postmortem examination.  The
patient was declared expired on [**2169-10-10**] at 12:40
p.m.
