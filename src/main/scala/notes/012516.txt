Service:

Note that the patient was admitted between [**2150-7-4**], and
[**2150-7-22**], however, discharge summary is missing and I
am asked to dictate it at this point.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a 54-year-old man
with cirrhosis, known cholelithiasis, transferred from an
outside facility with a small bowel obstruction.  He had
previously been admitted to this facility as well but had it
resolved and left AMA.  At the time of the current admission,
he had return of abdominal pain and distention which was
severe.  He had a medical history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis,
alcohol abuse, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia from
myelosuppression, anxiety and depression.  He had previously
undergone a diagnostic laparoscopy in [**2150-4-9**] which had been
planned to be a cholecystectomy but that was abandoned by the
surgeon secondary to his intra-abdominal anatomy and
difficulty.

He had a complicated social situation living with his mother,
divorced with two children.  Active smoker and drinker.
History of heroin in the past.  He was no methadone.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  At the time of admission, he was toxic
appearing with a distended, diffusely tender abdomen.  This
worsened on repeat examination with signs of peritonitis.  CT
scan was concerning for internal hernia with concern for the
integrity of the bowel as far as ischemia.

He was brought to the operating room for laparotomy.  The
high risks were discussed at length with him.  The operative
findings included a frozen abdomen with a foreshortened and
fibrotic mesentery.  He had abdominal wall varices which
required control and essentially an intra-abdominal cocoon
lining which was unable to be initially entered.  Some
adhesions were able to be lysed as there was a dilated loop
of bowel that was visualized superficially and given these
findings as well as the ability to decompress the abdominal
contents, the operation was stopped at that juncture and open
abdomen was left with a dressing.

He was brought back to the operating room over the next few
days on several occasions for re-evaluation.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] assisted with the operation on [**2150-7-6**].  He was
found to have a small piece of dead bowel which appeared to
be terminal ileum and cecum and this had an associated
perforation.  The ends of the bowel were left stapled off.  I
was still unable to round the entirety of it and abdomen was
left packed with drains.  He continued to require intensive
care unit care during this point-in-time.  Subsequently, he
was brought back to the operating room with leakage of bile.
A tube ileostomy was created and again a VAC was placed.
During this time, intensive care unit care continued.  He
continued to be fairly stable but in the intensive care unit
setting.  Given the extenuating circumstances of his abdomen
and the inability to provide definitive care and management,
our best case scenario was adequate drainage of the
ileostomy; however, he was really unable to achieve any
significant parenteral nutrition.  Ultimately the patient's
family as well as the patient were involved in making
decisions regarding his care.  He was able to be extubated
and was awake during this time for these conversations.
Social work and palliative care were also involved.  He was
maintained on CMO care in the intensive care unit because of
his high nursing needs.  He continued to have high drainage
from his abdominal wounds.  He was kept comfortable.  The
patient and family were in agreement that CMO was appropriate
care and he was therefore kept there in the intensive care
unit with comfort measures only until his death on [**2150-7-22**].
