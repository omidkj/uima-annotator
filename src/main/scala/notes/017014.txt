Haldol / Darvon / Keppra

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from [**Hospital Ward Name **] for paralytic ileus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
61 yo F w/PMHx sx for cirrhosis, Hepatitis C, COPD, MGUS, and hx
of lower GI bleeds presents w/ one week of fatigue, dizziness,
and recent BRBPR, of unclear duration, which patient states were
likely related to her hemorrhoids. Patient with chronic
constipation, and states that over the last few weeks she has
had bright red blood with her stools, as well as black tarry
stools. Patient has also noted recent fall 3 days prior
w/resultant LUQ pain. Patient has also noted 1-2 weeks of
abdominal distension. She also notes some fever and chills at
home. Of note, patient is very poor historian.
.
Patient has a history of known hemorrhoids and constipation,
most recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2-/2166**], where she was found
to have a hematocrit of 19, and had an endoscopy, sigmoidoscopy,
and colonoscopy performed, which were remarkable for portal
gastropathy, duodenitis, Schatzki's rings, and large internal
hemorrhoids which were thought to be responsible for the
bleeding. Patient was seen by GI and surgery during that
admission, and banding of the internal hemorrhoids was
performed. She required blood transfusions during this
admission.
.
In the ED, patient was found to be febrile to 100.0. She was
also found to have a tender abdomen, with new ascites, with
diagnostic paracentesis performed. Patient's hct was found to be
14 (31 on last check), and received FFP and 2u pRBC. Patient had
a negative NG lavage. Her first set of CE were negative.
.
EGD [**2-/2167**] showed no varices and + Portal gastropathy.
Colonoscopy with internal hemorrhoids in [**2-/2166**] which were
banded at that time. While prepping for colonoscopy with
golytely, abd became distended. Anoscopy performed at bedside
revealed internal hemorrhoids with no evidence of bleeding. AXR
consistent with possible small bowel ileus versus obstruction.
Hematocrit has been stable throughout her stay. The patient then
became encephalopathic, anuric and was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
NGT was placed for decompression and she was kept NPO. Foley was
placed and diuretics were d/ced. She was started on PR lactulose
for encephalopathy and improved. Her creatinine improved as
well. While in the unit she was found to have a pansensitive
Klebsiella UTI which was treated with 7d of CTX. On Monday the
pt was passing flatus and had no N/V so NGT was d/ced, however
the next day repeat AXR showed continued distended small bowel
so the NGT was placed again. She was kept NPO with TPN started
at that time.
.
During the early part of the hospital course, the patient became
agitated and wanted to leave AMA. She was seen by psych who
deemed her to have no insight into her medical condition and to
have no capacity, so if she attempts to leave she should be
sectioned. They spoke extensively with her daughter (and HCP)
who agreed. Apparently the patient had said she needed to leave
and see her dying aunt in [**Name (NI) 3908**] (per daughter this is not
true). While on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] she began calling 911 to get out
of the hospital, cut her IV lines with a scissor, and alled the
patient advocate repeatedly until phone was removed from her
room. She was kept on 1:1 sitter subsequently. She was givne
olanzapine 5mg x 1 which made her quite lethargic the following
day, but has since received 2.5mg without problem. Repeat
abdominal XR today shows no change in SBO.
.
She was transferred from the [**Hospital Ward Name **] [**Hospital Ward Name **] service to the
[**Hospital Ward Name **] liver service for closer follow up by the liver
team.

DIAGNOSTICS:
ECG Study Date of [**2167-2-27**]  11:22:10 PM
Baseline artifact
Sinus tachycardia
Generalized low voltage - clinical correlation is suggested
Otherwise baseline artifact makes comparison difficult
Since previous tracing of [**2166-6-4**], may be no significant change
but baseline artifact makes comparison difficult
