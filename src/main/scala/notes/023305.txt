Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
74 yo F h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI, DES in [**2145**], severe COPD on 4-5L O2
at home and severe TBM, FEV1 0.6, ESRD on HD, lung cancer, p/w
pneumonia. She states that her whole body just feels like jello
because she is so weak. This has been going on for several
weeks, but fell again today, hit her head. No LOC. Has been
unable to stand for the last day or so. Has been fully
ambulatory, until recently when she got a walker after she got
pneumonia (1.5 months). Feels like she can't even hold a cup of
tea, it is too heavy and she is too shaky.
.
of note, she was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2153-5-29**] for
PNA. She initially p/w SOB, CT findings c/w progression of
underlying lung cancer as well as bilateral consolidation;
thought to be aspiration in etiology and less likely
post-obstructive. Patient initially on vanc/zosyn, narrowed to
vanc/cefepime after cultures failed significant pathogens. After
CT demonstrated recurrence of cancer, discussed w patient,
pulmonologist and oncologist, and decided for no acute
intervention. Continued teselon pearls and guafenicin, codeine,
as well as nebs and inhalers. Of note, C diff tox returned
positive after discharge. Flagly 500mg po tid x21 days called
into pt pharmacy, and patient notified directly of diagnoses and
need for antibiotic treatment.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were 98.3 76 133/60 20 94% 5L.
Exam was notable for oropharynx dry.
Labs were notable for Cr. of 5 (baseline of ), wbc of 16.2 with
left shift (down from 24 prior on [**2153-5-19**]).
Patient underwent EKG showed NSR 70, LAD, LBBB, no stemi, c/w
prior EKG. CT Head W/O Contrast which showed No acute
intra-cranial process. Diffuse chronic small vessel ischemic
changes. CXR showed right basilar opacity is concerning for
developing focal right
lower lobe pneumonia.
Patient was given 1 L of NS, vanc, zosyn.
Patient was seen by no consults.
Patient was admitted for pneumonia.
Vital signs prior to transfer temp 98.4 hr 70 bp 141/70 rr18 99%

.
On the floor, she continues to feel very weak. She has an
intermittent cough that has occasionally produced sputum, but
has most often been dry.

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2153-6-12**]):
      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).

Blood Culture: [**6-8**]: pending, NGTD

Reports:
[**6-8**]: CXR
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The
dialysis
catheter ends in the right atrium, unchanged. Increased opacity
at the right lung base is concerning for developing pneumonia.
Stable left basilar opacity is combination of a small left
effusion and atelectasis. Suture material is redemonstrated in
the right upper lung. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
stable. There is no pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality
is identified.
IMPRESSION: Right basilar opacity is concerning for developing
focal right
lower lobe pneumonia.

CXR: [**2153-6-14**]
IMPRESSION:
Interval progression of a right lower lobe opacity concerning
for worsening pneumonia. Unchanged left lower lobe opacity and
right hilar mass.

CT Head: FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, large territorial infarction,
edema, mass, or shift of normally midline structures is present.
Diffuse periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodensities are consistent with small vessel ischemic changes.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent consistent with
cortical atrophy. The basal cisterns are widely patent. The
mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are well aerated. No
fractures or scalp hematoma is present.

IMPRESSION: Small vessel ischemic changes. No acute intracranial
process.

EEG: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to mild posterior background
slowing
suggestive of a diffuse mild encephalopathy.

C spine x-ray: IMPRESSION: Limited examination of the cervical
spine. Multilevel degenerative changes and minimal
anterolisthesis of C3 on C4.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo F h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI, DES in [**2145**], severe COPD on 4-5L O2
at home and severe TBM, FEV1 0.6, ESRD on HD, lung cancer,
recently treated for MRSA HAP and C. Diff, p/w pneumonia.

# Health Care Associated Pneumonia: Possibly from aspiration vs.
post-obstructive.   In the setting of 3 prior lung resections
and extensive COPD, pt had limited pulmonary reserve. She was
treated with IV vancomycin and Zosyn and aggressive oxygen
therapy. She was transitioned to cefepime and vancomycin to be
given in dialysis and po Flagyl. She was continue on her COPD
treatment of spiriva, singulair, albuterol/ipratropium
nebulizers prn as well as small doses of morphine/xanax prn for
sob/anxiety. She triggered three times during her hospital stay,
two for hypoxia and one for afib with RVR. Her pneumonia was
progressing on imaging and clinically and she was transitioned
to vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/cipro. She continued to be hypoxic to as low as 80%
on NRB plus NC and it was decided patient could try CPAP in the
MICU to see if this would aide in her oxygenation. It was felt
by family and physicians that the patient would likely not
survive this pneumonia without intubation. Patient was clearly
DNR/DNI and it was decided to make the patient CMO. Pt was
transferred back to floors for remainder of
