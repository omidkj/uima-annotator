History of Present Illness:
76 year old female with h/o IPF on chronic prednisone, COPD with
trach, CHF, mechanical mitral valve, pacemaker, and anemia who
presents with several days of worsening dysypnea, peripheral
edema, and fatigue. She reports difficulty walking very short
distances due to SOB and lightheadness frequently. She reports
[**2-28**] pillow orthopnea that remains unchanged from baseline. She
reports frequent productive cough that occasionally is bloody,

fluctuates in severity. She denies changes in bowel habits and
denies changes in urination. She denies changes in appetite,
denies fever, chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, melena, and BRBPR.She denies sick contacts and recent
travel.

In the ED, labs were significant for Hct 14, INR 10, creatinine
2.1.  Had peripheral edema on exam.  She was ordered for 2 units
PRBCs (not given due to difficult crossmatch), crossmatched 4
units. Also given 5mg po vitamin K.  She was not given lasix or
FFP.  Most recent vitals 85 113/49 23 100% 5L.
.

Images:
[**10-7**] Chest AP: Low lung volumes with known idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis. While a subtle superimposed acute consolidation in the
lung bases is difficult to exclude, it would be highly
coincidental and is felt less likely with the increased opacity
likely due to crowding.

CXR ([**10-8**]):
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Status post sternotomy, status post valvular
replacement. The
external and internal pacemaker with leads are visible.
Unchanged evidence of a right basal opacity with a predominantly
reticular pattern, that might, in part be, fibrotic.  These are
likely to be related to the known history of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. There is no evidence of fluid overload on
the current image. No pleural effusions. No parenchymal
opacities have newly occurred.
.
CT Torso: [**10-27**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis with mild bibasilar
consolidations, worse on the right than the left, likely
reflecting atelectasis, although
superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
2. Status post right mastectomy.
3. Cholelithiasis in a nondistended gallbladder with mild wall
edema/pericholecystic fluid likely reflects either CHF or
hypoproteinemia.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
5. No evidence of intra-abdominal free air or organized fluid
collection.
6. Indistinct pancreatic head; correlate with pancreatic enzymes
if clinical concern for pancreatitis.
.
RUQ US [**10-25**]
1. Sludge and stones in the gallbladder neck without other
findings to
suggest acute cholecystitis. If there is continued clinical
concern, a HIDA scan may be more definitive in the exclusion of
acute cholecystitis.
2. Dilated hepatic veins consistent with diastolic dysfunction
.
CT Head [**10-20**]
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Small vessel ischemic disease and diffuse cerebral atrophy.

.
Pathology:
Bronchial lavage:
  ATYPICAL.
  Atypical squamous cells.
  Bronchial cells and inflammatory cells.

Colonic polyp, distal ascending/proximal transverse (biopsy):
