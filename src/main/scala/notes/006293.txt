TWO VIEW CHEST, [**2191-10-2**].
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable compared to the
prior postoperative radiograph. Bibasilar atelectasis shows
interval improvement. Small bilateral pleural effusions are not
substantially changed.
IMPRESSION: Improving bibasilar atelectasis. Persistent small
pleural effusions.

Echo [**9-27**]

Conclusions:
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s).
2. No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial
septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no
asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is
normal. No left ventricular aneurysm is seen. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
4. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline
normal. Interventricular septal motion is normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending
aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There
are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending
thoracic aorta.
6. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. No masses or
vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area
0.8-1.0cm2). Peak gradient = 75 mmHg. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may
be
significantly UNDERestimated.]
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-CPB: On infusion of Phenylephrine, epinephrine. Well-seated
bioprosthetic
valve in the aortic position. No paravalvular leak. Aortic
gradient now 25
mmHg. MR is mild. LVEF is preserved post-CPB. Normal aortic
contour
post-decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to cardiac surgery service and a
pulmonology consult was obtained, and it was felt that his
pulmonary venous hypertension was largely due to his AS. He was
also seen by the sleep fellow to set up outpatient post op
follow up for liekly sleep apnea. He continued on a course of
amoxicillin for his pre-admission dental extractions. He
developed some warmth, pain and erythema on his cheek around the
site of his dental extractions and was seen by dental medicine
after which he was placed on IV clindamycin with resolution of
his symptoms. He was taken to the operating room on [**2191-9-27**]
where he underwent an AVR. He was transferred to the ICU in
critical but stable condition on propofol and epinephrine.  He
was extubated later that same day. He had some hallucinations at
night which resolved. He had some atrial fibrillation which was
treated with lopressor, and he converted to a sinus rhythm. He
had a temperature of 101.5 on POD #4, and was pancultured. All
testing was negative. He was seen by physical therapy who felt
that he would benefit from rehab given his continued [**1-25**] liter
oxygen requirement and need for endurance training and
assistance in and out of bed. He was ready for discharge to
rehab on POD #6.
