he was alert and cooperative.  He had a 4+/5 weakness on the

of 1.9 and a systolic blood pressure to 20.  He became
rapidly became unresponsive with a blood pressure of 170/120.
He was then intubated and transferred at 7:00 a.m. to the
[**Hospital1 69**].  In the Emergency Room

Coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.  4.
Gout.  5.  Hyperlipidemia.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Coumadin 5 mg po q.d.,

q.d., Dicloxacillin 0.25 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He had a blood pressure
of 216/80, heart rate of 126.  He was morbidly obese, no
carotid bruits, no JVD.  No thyromegaly.  Cardiac sound was
notable for regular rate and rhythm.  Chest was clear to
auscultation and abdomen was benign.  No clubbing, cyanosis
or edema of extremities.  On neurological examination he was
intubated and sedated.  He was not able to respond to voice
or noxious stimuli.  His right pupil was 3 mm and minimally
reactive.  His left pupil was 2 mm and minimally reactive.
He had no ocular or cephalic response.  No gag.  He was
breathing over the ventilator.  He had no spontaneous movements
and he had slight withdraw of the right foot to pain.  No
movement to pain in other limbs.  He was hyperreflexic all
throughout and his toes were up going bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell 12.7,
hematocrit 49.7, platelets 306, sodium 143, potassium 3.9,
chloride 101, CO2 27, BUN 15, creatinine 1, glucose 123, PTT
25, INR 1.9, CK 78.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 31853**] was admitted to the Neurological
Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure control with a
systolic blood pressure goal of 140 to 160.  Labetalol was
started and titrated to achieve such goal.  He received fresh
frozen platelets times four.  He was admitted for
neurological examination q one hour, gastrointestinal
prophylaxis and Pneumoboots were started.  His story was
consistent with a hypertensive bleed in the pons, which
extended to the floor of the ventricle as manifested with
sudden nausea, vomiting before becoming unresponsive.  His
examination on admission suggested that his condition was
critical, because of the absence of brain stem reflexes.  He
continued to be intubated and was cycled with cardiac enzymes
to rule out myocardial infarction.  A head CT was repeated
during his stay at the [**Hospital1 69**]
and showed increase in size in hemorrhage with extension to
the fourth ventricle and hydrocephalus.  His physical
examination worsened with no response to pain or verbal
stimuli, pupils became 3 mm nonreactive to light, no
corneals, no dulls, the only brainstem reflex present at that
time was gag.  He did not withdraw to pain in either upper
extremities
and lower extremities presented with bilateral triple flexion
response right more then left.  Bilateral toes are up going.

At that point his wife was consulted and explained of poor
prognosis and the fact that he lacked brain stem responses.
After answering all the questions to his wife the family
decided to withdraw care and order comfort measures only.
The patient was extubated on [**2114-11-5**].  He was
declared dead after thorough examination at 5:12 p.m.

CAUSE OF DEATH:
Pontine bleed.
