Reports:
EGD:
 Normal duodenum.
Impression: Grade 2 esophageal varices
Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy
Post Gastric bypass with gastro-jejunostomy
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Plan:
1) Intravenous PPI
2) NPO for 48 hours as severe gastritis
3) Wean off sedation - when conscious for carafate 1gram qid
4) Start Nadolol 20mg [**Hospital1 **] if not contra-indicated
5) Repeat EGD and for banding in 2 weeks.


Brief Hospital Course:
44F h/o HCV c/b cirrhosis and varices, morbid obesity s/p
gastric bypass surgery with prior anastomotic ulcer presenting
with hematemesis was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU from an outside
hospital with upper GI bleed.  Upper endoscopy was peformed and
showed macerated polyp near anastomotic site and grade II
nonbleeding varices. surgery c/s to evaluate if issue with
gastric bypass surgical site, but no clear evidence that this
was the source.  She was started on octreotide gtt, nadolol,
carafate, ppi, and levo for ppx.  Pt found to have a falling hct
to 25, requiring transfusion of 1 units PRBC, and given vitamin
K 1mg IV.  Abdominal US was performed and showed coarse
echotexture, patent vessels, and normal ducts.  RUL opacity was
seen on CXR and vancomycin and flagy were added to levo.  She
was intabated for airway protection in the setting of
hematemesis.  CT chest subsequently showed complete colapse of
the RUL.  Bronchoscopy was performed because of concern about
obstruction causing collapse but no mass was found and collapse
attributed to mucous plugging, though secretion were suggestive
of CAP.  Vanc and flagyl where discontinued based on sputum
results and and levo was continued.  She was then transfered out
of the intensive care unit and brought to the medicine floor. On
the medicine floor you were found to have a falling hematocrit
to 25 and was guaiac positive.  She was transfused an additional
2 units PRBCs with recovery of hct to 33. Repeat upper endoscopy
was was performed and no bleeding was found during this
endoscopy, but gastritis and esophageal varices were seen. Three
esophageal varices were banded and she was continued on protonix
and sucralfate for treatment of gastritis. On the day of
discharge hematocrit was stable and pt was guaiac negative.  She
was discharge with a perscription for levofloxacin to complete a
14 day course.
.
Of Note: While the pt was intbated the MICU team sought the pt's
next of [**Doctor First Name **] to give consent for EGD, at which time it was found
that the pt's son had died.  After EGD pt was extubated and
transferred to the floor where she was told of the death of her
son.  She was evaluated by psychiatry and social work who
ensured that pt had adequate follow up with her therapist and
recommended continuation of Xanax with addition of remeron.
