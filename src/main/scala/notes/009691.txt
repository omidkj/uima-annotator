Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levaquin / Quinolones

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, pulmonary emboli

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old female with past medical history
significant for lung cancer with brain metastasis, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, and history of PEs on home coumadin which was
recently stopped for surgery and re-started 2 days ago who
presents now to ED as transfer from her outpatient brain XRT
appointment after notable hypotension today to 70s systolic
range with mild dizziness and new complaints of shortness of
breath and feeling "winded". She explains having fairly acute
onset of her dyspnea while lying in bed at rest last night and
shortness of breath has been constant over the past 24 hours.
.
Patient had been holding her home coumadin since recent
neurosurgery last month (~[**6-14**]) and only restarted her coumadin
without bridging 2 days ago. Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was diagnosed
with brain mets in [**Month (only) 116**] after presenting with unsteady balance,
nausea and emesis. She is s/p open brain resection on [**2126-6-5**] with drain-placement and later CSF diversion procedure with
placement of a VP shunt on [**2126-6-14**].
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were: T97.4F, systolic 70/palp,
HR 120, RR 23 and O2 sat 89% RA. She complained of shortness of
breath but denied any dizziness, chest pains, headaches, nausea
or emesis. Stated she did have some nausea earlier in morning at
her brain XRT appointment. In ED, she was initially given IV
order for IV vanco/zosyn which was soon stopped after CTA
confirmed large saddle emboli as cause for her hypotension. She
was fluid responsive and BPs came up to 109-130s/50-80s range
after 2L IVFs. O2 sats were improved to 97-100% on 3-5L NC. CT
head showed no intraparenchymal hemorrhages and revealed stable
post-operative changes in posterior fossa.
.
Neurosurgery was consulted regarding her ability to safely start
heparin gtt given her metastatic brain lesions and felt it was
safe to start with plan for no bolus dose, PTT goal 40-60 and
repeat head CT once she was in this PTT range. In ED, bedside
TTE done and showed no overt effusions, no RV strain or
collapse. EKG showed rate 118, sinus, TWIs in V1-V2 with deep
T-waves and RV strain.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], initial vital signs were: afebrile, HR
117, BP 130/95, RR 21, 98% on 3L NC. She was fully alert and
oriented and denied any pain. Complained of feeling occasionally
winded even with nasal cannula in place. Appeared to be in no
acute distress. Denies dizziness.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63yo female with history of
Parkinson's disease, metastatic lung cancer (undergoing brain
XRT), and h/o pulmonary embolisms who presents now with
hypotension, and new saddle PE in setting of being off of her
usual Coumadin for several weeks.  She was transferred to the
floor on [**7-13**] and then transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**7-15**] for
acute hypotension, found to have GNR bactermia secondary to UTI;
then tx back to floor and did well.
.
#Hypotension / Saddle Pulmonary embolism: Patient has history of
pulmonary emboli that dates back to [**2125-3-28**]. She had been on
home Coumadin which was discontinued mid-[**Month (only) **] for neurosurgery
and never restarted until she began her home Coumadin dosing 2
days prior to admission with no bridging. INR on admission was
1.2 range and CTA confirms large saddle embolus. EKG with right
heart strain. After 2L IVFs , BP improved to low 100-120s
systolic range. O2 saturations maintained at >95% now on 3L
nasal cannula; she was eventually weaned to 1L. Management
options for any thrombolysis contraindicated as patient with
intracranial brain metastasis.   The patient was put on a
heparin drip, day 3 on [**2126-7-14**] with a goal PTT of 50-70. An IVC
filter was also placed. She was subsequently transitioned to
Lovenox for discharge.

#Sepsis due to E coli bacteremia: She was re-admitted to the ICU
on [**7-17**] for hypotension and was placed on pressor support and
empiric antibiotics. On [**7-17**], her blood grew gram(-)rods. She
was already on appropriate covera
