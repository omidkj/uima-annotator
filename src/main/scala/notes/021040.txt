History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with CHF, HTN, chronic constipation,
osteoporosis w/ h/o ORIF for hip fracture, now presents from
home to [**Hospital1 18**] with diffuse, crampy, sometimes sharp progressive
abdominal pain x several days and severe constipation.  She
reports no bowel movement for "ages," unsure for how long.
Denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomitting.  Reports chronically
poor appetite and poor PO intake of late.

Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,
diaphoresis.  Denies cough or URI symptoms.  Chronic trouble
with initiating urination but no dysuria or urinary frequency.

In the ED, afebrile and initially vital signs stable with CT of
abdomen showing markedly distended stool filled rectum (11 cm).
She was manually disimpacted with some relief.

However, her lactate came back at 5.8 and her blood pressure
proceeded to drop to a nadir of 48/palp, for which a femoral
central line was placed and Levophed was started.  She responded
well to the Levophed with her systolic blood pressure coming up
to 90s-100s.

In an extensive discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Ms. [**Known firstname 8797**] [**Known lastname 12166**] clearly expressed that she did not want
aggressive or heroic measures or treatment and is DNR/DNI.  She
agreed to pressors or medications to treat her blood pressures
but would not want cardiac catheterization in the case of a
heart attack or further invasive measures.  However, a femoral
line was placed in the Emergency Department.

compared to [**2197-8-11**]

EKG [**2197-12-26**] at 11:23 PM:sinus tachycardia with left axis
deviation, poor R wave progression, new T wave inversions in I
and V4-V6, nl intervals,

EKG [**2197-12-27**] at [**2198-12-27**] 5:21 AM: NSR A 89bmp, nl intervals, ,
o/w unchanged from [**12-26**] EKG

Last Echocardiogram ([**2194-6-5**]): Views are technically suboptimal.
LV systolic function appears focally depressed with probably
thinned and akinetic inferior and inferolateral basal segments.
LVEF 40-45%. mild AS, 1+ AR 2+ MR, moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female presented with sepsis secondary to bowel
microperforation.  The patient was initially treated with
levofloxacin and flagyl.  She was given aggressive IVFs for
rescusitaion and started on levophed for pressor support.  Her
blood pressure continued to require increased support, and
additional pressors were added to her regimen.  She also
presented with elevated cardiac enzymes suggestive of demand
ischemia in the setting of underlying coronary artery disease.
She presented with an anion gap metabolic acidosis thought to be
due to her lactic acidosis.  She also presented with
coagulopathy; DIC labs were negative.  The patient continued to
decompensate, becoming progressively hypotensive and tachycardic
despite antibiotics, bowel regimen, IVFs and pressors.  On the
second day of hospitalization, decision was made with two of Ms.
[**Known lastname 12166**]' three sons, one of whom served as her health care proxy,
to withdraw care.  Blood pressure continued to decline and she
had periods of tachyarrhythmia.  Ms. [**Known lastname 12166**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2197-12-29**].
