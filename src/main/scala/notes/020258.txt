cardiac catheterization on [**2172-9-30**] which revealed global
hypokinesis, left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%,
calcification of the aortic valve with severe aortic
stenosis, 70% stenosis of the D1.  Aortic valve area was
noted to be .78 cm.  The patient was also noted to have a
urinary tract infection and was started on Bactrim which was
then changed to Levaquin.  On admission patient's hematocrit
was noted to be low at 28.  This was noted to be stable for
the patient and she is on iron therapy.  The patient was
taken to the operating room on [**2172-10-2**] and underwent an
aortic valve replacement with a #23 CE valve.  She tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on

well and was extubated successfully the night of her surgery.
She was weaned off her Milrinone and neo drips and was
transferred to the floor on postoperative day #1.  Lasix,
Lopressor and Aspirin were started.  The patient received
nebulizer treatments for her COPD.  The patient was seen by
physical therapy and was noted to have impaired functional
status compared to baseline and to benefit from [**Hospital 3058**]

postoperative day #2.  Her hematocrit was noted to be low at
24, however, as the patient was asymptomatic at this point
her transfusion was held.  Her respiratory status continued
to improve and she was restarted on her oral hypoglycemic
medications.  Postoperative day #3 the patient was screened
