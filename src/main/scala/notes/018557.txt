Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheal piece replacement
GJ Tube placement
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
28 year-old quadrapedic female with severe mental retardation
and cerebral palsy chronically trached who presented from OSH
with respiratory distress. Pt was previously seen at [**Hospital1 64975**] for respiratory distress one day PTA and
sent home on Keflex. She represented to the OSH with worsening
secretions and continued labored breathing. ABG: 7.45/47/120
(35%). Pt usually recieves care at [**Hospital1 **] (Chronic Care
Service/Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4027**] - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64976**]) or [**Hospital1 112**], however, there
was no available beds so the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with
concerns of worsening respiratory distress in setting of
suspected PNA. She was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 1810**]
from [**1-2**] - [**1-13**] for LLL PNA treated with Aztreonam and Clinda
(pansensitive pseudomonas and [**Doctor First Name **] as per ID fellow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64977**]
at [**Hospital1 **]).
.
In the ED the pt received ABX (Levofloxacin, Vanco and Flagyl),
albuterol neb, and KCL 20 mEq. A central line was placed. Bld
and urine cultures sent. WBC count noted to be 36 with 6 %
bandemia. CXR revealed a possible subtle retrocardiac density.
.
The pt previously had a customized trach without a cuff which
was found to have a leak in the ED.  IP was consulted in the ED
and the trach was changed to one with a cuff so the pt could be
vented.  During the procedure, significant amounts of
granulation tissue was found distal to the trach impeding air
flow (approximately 80% luminal obstruction).  The new trach was
pushed through the granulation tissue to 3cm above the carina.
A bronchoscopy was performed in the ED demonstrated clearance of
previously obstructing granulation tissue.

Neurologic: Alert and moves eyes in response to voice,
non-verbal, does not follow commands, extremities contracted
without movement

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES: OSH-> WBC 28.7/HCT 39.7/PLT 813; Na 129/K 2.9 (given 40
mEq through PEG)/CO2 30/BUN 6/Cr 0.7.
.
EKG: sinus tach, Rate 115, poor baseline
.
CXR [**2153-1-25**]: tracheostomy tube, which terminates 3 cm above the
carina. There is marked kyphoscoliosis of the thoracic spine,
making these views non-standard in orientation. Allowing for
this rotation, there is no definite pleural effusion,
pneumothorax, or consolidation. The heart size is difficult to
assess. There may be subtle retrocardiac density.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2153-2-15**] 2:45 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Evaluate for abscess, pt intubated,
Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
29 year old woman with CP MR, with pseumdomonas growing, GJ Tube
placed, pt intubated
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Evaluate for abscess, pt intubated,
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Cerebral palsy, mental retardation, with pseudomonas
infection, status post GJ tube placement.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images of the chest, abdomen, and
pelvis were obtained without oral or intravenous contrast.

COMPARISON: None.

CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is marked thoracic deformity
due to severe scoliosis. A tracheostomy tube is present with tip
of the tube at the thoracic inlet. The heart and great vessels
are unremarkable. There is no lymphadenopathy. No consolidations
are present. There is patchy dependent atelectasis. Several
vague subcentimeter tiny nodular opacities are present at the
right lung base. There are no pleural effusions.

ABDOMEN CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder,
pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and abdominal
vasculature is unremarkable. There is marked scoliotic deformity
of the thoracolumbar spine. A gastrojejunostomy tube is present
with tip in the proximal jejunum. There is a skin defect
overlying the right mid abdomen, with mild soft tissue density
in the underlying abdominal wall. This is likely related to
prior intervention. No fluid collections are present. There is
no free abdominal air or fluid.

PELVIS CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The distal ureters and pelvic
organs are unremarkable. A Foley is present within the bladder.
There is marked deformity of both hips. No fluid collections are
present.

IMPRESSION:

1. No fever source identified.

2. Several tiny nodular opacities at the right lung base. These
are nonspecific and are likely chronic, possibly due to old
infection.

Reason: please change G tube to G-J tube and remove J tube.
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
29 year old woman with CP and leaking J tube
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please change G tube to G-J tube and remove J tube.
HISTORY: 29-year-old woman with _____ and leaking J-tube site.
The J-tube has previously been removed. Our aim is to convert
the G-tube to a GJ tube.

PHYSICIANS: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 26181**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 380**] performed the
procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**], the attending radiologist, being
present and supervising throughout the procedure.

PROCEDURE: Following written informed consent from the patient's
mother, the patient was positioned supine on the angiography
table. The preprocedure timeout was performed to confirm
patient, procedure and site. Standard sterile prep and drape of
the ventral abdomen and in situ gastrostomy catheter (18 French
Foley catheter). The guidewire was passed through the Foley
catheter and the Foley catheter was removed. The bright-tip
vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire and with the aid
of a Kumpe catheter, the pylorus was intubated and the wire and
catheter were advanced through the duodenum and into the
jejunum. The Kumpe catheter was then exchanged for an MPA
catheter and the wire and catheter were advanced to the level of
the jejunostomy. The jejunostomy was then intubated and efferent
limb was cannulated using the dilator from the vascular sheath
and a Bentson guidewire. Contrast injection through the MPA
catheter in the afferent limb of the jejunostomy was then
performed and this demonstrated the course of the bowel at what
appears to be a loop jejunostomy. The guidewire was then
advanced around the loop in from the afferent limb to the
efferent limb. A 22 French MIC catheter was then advanced over
the guidewire and positioned with its tip in the jejunum distal
to the jejunostomy site. The balloon was positioned in the
stomach and inflated with 7 cc of sterile saline. A dressing was
applied. Contrast was injected through the tube and confirmed
catheter tip positioned in the jejunum beyond the jejunostomy
site and the position of the balloon within the stomach. The
catheter was then flushed with saline to clear the contrast.
There were no immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Successful replacement of the in situ gastrostomy
catheter with a 22
