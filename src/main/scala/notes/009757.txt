and line sepsis, with decreased urinary output.  The patient
was controlled with Lopressor, and blood pressure improved.
Output improved, and the patient was transferred to the floor
on [**10-28**].

Last night, the patient had frank melanotic stools times
four.  She was on Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.  The patient's
hematocrit fell from 35 to 28 overnight.  She denied nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy
was done, and revealed fresh bleeding with large blood in the
fundus of the stomach.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history includes)

infarction in [**2163**].
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

5.  Morbid obesity.
6.  Increased cholesterol.
7.  History of gastrointestinal bleed.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications on transfer to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit included regular insulin
sliding-scale, Ditropan, subcutaneous heparin, Lopressor,
digoxin, Protonix, statin powder, Epogen, aspirin, Isordil,
and Levaquin, and vitamin K.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed a temperature of 98, blood pressure of 123/76, pulse
of 76, oxygen saturation of 85% on room air.  Generally,
examination revealed an obese and sleepy 68-year-old female.
Mucous membranes were dry.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed distant heart sounds.  Lungs revealed mild wheezing
diffusely.  The abdomen was obese, edematous.  Extremities
revealed dressing over both ankles, 3+ edema, and there was
cellulitis in the left arm.  Neurologically, the patient was
alert and oriented times two, moved all extremities
spontaneously.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed a white blood cell count of 15.8,
hematocrit of 28.7, platelets of 160.  Sodium of 136,
potassium of 5.1, chloride of 97, bicarbonate of 25, blood
urea nitrogen of 103, creatinine of 3.3, with a glucose
of 174.  Creatine kinase was 186.  Troponin was 6.2.  ALT
was 14, AST of 53, alkaline phosphatase was 76.  Blood
cultures from the [**10-26**] showed Staphylococcus
coagulase negative in one bottle only.  Sputum from [**10-28**] was contaminated, and wound culture showed coagulase
positive Staphylococcus aureus and carinii bacterium.

A CT of the abdomen on [**10-27**] showed perihepatic fluid
with no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal
dilatation.  No obvious varices.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 68-year-old female with morbid
obesity, admitted for line sepsis, methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus with a transient decrease in urinary
output, and atrial fibrillation, now controlled, who is now
re-admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with an upper
gastrointestinal bleed.

There was blood seen in her lower esophagus by
esophagogastroduodenoscopy with a large amount of clots and
oozing red blood in the fundus.  The patient was not able to
protect airway herself, and she was do not intubate (per her
sister who was her health care proxy).  An nasogastric tube
was placed, and the patient did not clear after 8 liters of
fluid.  A blood transfusion was initiated.  The patient was
given Protonix intravenously.

Per, the Gastrointestinal Service, the patient was unable to
be re-scoped without intubation.  However, since she was
refusing intubation because the patient wanted to be do not
intubate even for temporary measures.  The patient understood
that this eliminated the possibility of gaining control of
bleed via esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  The Interventional
Radiology Service was consulted, but they were unable to take
the patient to angiography for possible embolization
secondary to the patient's weight and difficulty in accessing
groin and problems of ascites.  The patient also received 2
units of fresh frozen plasma to correct coagulation.

The team had a conversation with her sister regarding limited
options at this point.  We reiterated that
esophagogastroduodenoscopy with intubation might be her last
hope.  The sister did understand the situation, but reported
that the patient repeatedly expressed the desire to be do not
resuscitate/do not intubate.  Meanwhile, the patient was
receiving blood transfusions and fluid resuscitation.

The team was called at 6:30 in the morning by bedside and
found the patient having no respirations.  The patient
subsequently passed away at that time.  The patient was
pronounced dead at 6:30 in the morning on [**2166-10-30**].
