Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the hostipal and monitored overnight. On HD
#2 she began having temps to 104.0. That night she became
hypotensive and somulent and was transferred to the ICU. She was
intubated and fluid resusitated. She was taken to the OR
emergently for exploration. She was found to have a closed loop
obstruction of her SB. 100 cm of SB were resected and she was
left open and transferred to the ICU. Post op she had severe
sepsis and was started on broad spectrum abx and Xigris. She
slowly improved and was weaned from her pressors. She stablized
and was taken back to the operating room for a washout and
closure. Intraoperatively, a focal area of necrosis of the SB
was identified and it was resected. She was closed with Dexon
absorbable mesh and a VAC was placed. Plastic surgery was
consulted intra-op and followed the her throughout her stay. She
was transferred back to the ICU and she slowly improved. She was
attempted to be weaned from the vent but was unable. Therefore
it was decided to proceed with a perc trach. After the trach was
placed she was able to wean from the ventilator and was
tolerating trach mask prior to discharge. A post-pyloric feeding
tube was placed intra-op and she was started on TF. She had high
stool output which was checked multiple times for C diff. All
were negative. Her TF were changed and her output decreased. She
had a PICC line placed for a 2 wk abx course of Vanco/Levo. She
had a MRSA/Ecoli bacteremia likely from her necrotic bowel. She
was afebrile for over 1 wk after starting the abx. PT/OT were
consulted and worked with her throughout her hospital stay.
Speech and Swallow evaluated her and she was able to pass her
beside evaluation. She will need a Video swallow when more
stable prior to starting to take PO.
