Chief Complaint:
Left leg/foot infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

[**2162-7-26**]: EGD


History of Present Illness:
73M, with PMH Wegener's s/p renal transplant on Prograf and R
BKA secondary to trauma, who was admitted to [**Hospital3 29691**] with septic shock secondary to left lower extremity
cellulitis and Serratia bacteremia, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management and revision of his AV fistula.
.
Briefly, the patient injured his left lower extremity on [**2162-7-8**]
by "kicking a stick," developed increased pain/swelling/erythema
and a fever of 102 overnight, and was then brought to [**Hospital1 56809**] where he was diagnosed with cellulitis.  After
admission, the patient dveloped septic shock with multiorgan
system failure and transferred to the ICU.  Wound and blood
cultures subsequently returned positive for Serratia marescens.
In the ICU, he was anuric, with liver dysfunction and "severe
respiratory limitations."  For his infection, he was started on
broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftaz and levo), and his left foot
was surgically debrided, leaving a yellow eschar, with silvadone
dressing done [**Hospital1 **] afterwards.  For his shock, he required
norepinephrine and vasopressin that were started on [**7-10**] and
stopped on [**7-13**].  On [**7-11**], the patient developed afib with RVR,
was treated with amiodarone drip until [**7-15**], after which he went
in and out of afib at a rate of 74-75 on metoprolol.  For his
anuria, he was dialyzed on [**6-15**] and [**7-19**] via a
pre-existing LUE AV fistula.  During his last dialysis on [**7-19**],
600cc were taken off, and K of 2.4 was corrected with a 4.0
bath.  Afterwards, he had UOP 20-30 cc/hr by foley, BUN 85 and
Cr 3.2.  For hypoxemia, he was placed on a BiPAP mask, and
non-invasive ventilation was complicated by Stage II ulcer on
the bridge of his nose.  ICU course was also complicated by
metabolic acidosis, toxic metabolic encephalopathy with global
weakness, and thrombocytopenia.
.
Of note, the patient has been off pressors since [**7-13**], and off
amiodarone since [**7-15**].  His last hemodialysis was on the morning
of [**7-19**].  Additionally, left lower extremity ABI's showed: calf
1.09, ankle (PT) 0.91, ankle (DP) 0.84, digit 0.97.  Cr trend at
Sturdy included 0.95 (on admission) with peak of 4.95 upon
starting dialysis on [**7-14**].  Subsequently, Cr decreased to 3.2.
BUN was 29 on admission, peaked at 87 and was 85 on transfer.
WBC peaked at 23.5 and were 11.2 on transfer.  Platelets had
dropped from 119 on admission, to a nadir of 56, and were 70 at
the time of discharge.  Last tacrolimus level on [**7-15**] was 3.8.
Wound and blood culture Serratia marescens was sensitive to
ceftriaxone, cipro, ertapenem, gentamicin, imipenem,
levofloxacin, tobramycin, and SXT.  EKG on [**7-15**] at OSH showed
junctional tachcardia at 146 bpm with LVH and old anterior
infarct.
.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and
revision of his AV fistula, as he was difficult to dialyze
through the existing one.
.
On the floor, his initial vital signs were T 36.8(98.3), HR 78,
BP 142/57, RR 18, SaO2 96% 4L NC.  He was somwehat sleepy and
confused.  He complained of pain in his left foot, but had no
other complaints.
