IMAGING:
CXR [**9-25**]: Small right pneumothorax with subcutaneous emphysema
in the right neck and lateral chest wall. Mildly displaced
fracture of the right clavicle. Atelectasis in the right lung.
CT-C spine [**9-25**]: No evidence of fracture or malalignment. Small
right pneumothorax, incompletely imaged. Right anterior neck and
chest wall subcutaneous air.
CT head w/o contrast [**9-25**]: No acute intracranial process.
Chest CT [**9-25**]: 1. Small right pneumothorax, without evidence of
tension. 2.4 x 1.2 cm ovoid density in the right upper lobe
adjacent to the mediastinum is likely a pulmonary contusion.
Displaced, segmental right mid clavicular fracture. Possible
non-
displaced lateral right 5th rib fracture.
4. Subcutaneous air tracking along the anterior right chest wall
and deep
spaces of the anterior right neck.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team and at first
evaluated by Neurosurgery for right CPA meningioma vs traumatic
subarachnoid. It was felt that the CT finding was not
subarachnoid hemorrhage and therefore no further neurosurgical
intervention was warranted. She did not require seizure
prophylaxis.

Because of her rib fractures and small pneumothorax she was
admitted to the ICU for close respiratory monitoring; no chest
tube was required. She was given supplemental oxygen and IV
narcotics for pain control initially.

She was seen by Orthopedics for her clavicle fracture which was
treated with a sling and she will follow up in a couple of weeks
in [**Hospital 5498**] clinic.

Once stable she was transferred to the regular surgical unit
where she continued to progress.

Her pain medications were changed to oral form and her pain was
well controlled with this regimen. Eventually she was weaned off
of the oxygen.

She was able to tolerate a regular diet and ambulating
independently.

She was discharged to home on hospital day 3 and will return for
follow up in [**Hospital 2536**] clinic in a few weeks.
