History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80594**] is a 64 year old man s/p a bioprosthetic aortic
valve replacement in [**12-29**] who presented to [**Hospital3 16025**] with fevers.  He was observed and sent home.  Upon growth
of gram positive cocci from his blood cultures, he was called
back to the hospital. Upon assessment he was found to be
hypotensive, bradycardic with a junctional rhythm, in ARF and
mottled.  He was intubated, requiring pressors and Transvenous
pacing wire for hemodynamic augmentation.TEE showed vegetation
on TV, left atrial thrombus and aortic dilitation. After a
hospital course at Bay State to optimize Mr.[**Known lastname 80595**] status,
Mr.[**Known lastname 80594**] was  transferred to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center for
evaluation for surgical intervention for his aortic and
tricuspid valve endocarditis.

Past Medical History:
Aortic valve replacement [**12-29**] (AS)
Atrial Fibrillation
EtOH abuse with DTs
Cirrhosis- Childs B
Gastrointestinal bleed
Gastroesophageal reflux disease
Congenstive heart failure
Coronary artery disease
MSSA sputum [**11-28**]
Cerebral vascular accident

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80594**] [**Last Name (Titles) 80596**] 1 pint of vodka daily.  He has a 20 pack
year smoking history.


Family History:
noncontributory

Physical Exam:
At the time of admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 80594**] was sedated and
intubated.  His skin exam revealed a diffuse macular rash
covering his back, chest, arms, and legs with evidence of skin
sloughing on groin and arms. Stage II pressure ulcers are noted
on his coccyx, buttucks, and upper thighs including several
blisters.  His upper back revealed several skin tears.  An
x-Left subclavian line site was noted to be red and macerated
with serous drainage.  His right toes were noted to be dusky and
include several areas of maceration and necrosis.  Ausculatation
of his lungs revealed bilateral rhonchi which was coarse and
diffuse.  His heart was of regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI
systolic ejection murmur.  His bowels were distended but soft
with positive bowel sounds.  His extremities were warm with 3+
edema.  No varicosities were noted.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
 Findings
Patient was sedated with Propafol iv per CVICU intensivist.
Moderate size left pleural effusion was noted. Due to recent
diagnosis of antral mass and gastric bleed, the GE junction was
not crossed.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo contrast
in the body of the LA. Thrombus in the body of the LA. Definite
thrombus in the LAA. All four pulmonary veins not identified.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Depressed RAA ejection
velocity (<0.2m/s). No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.
AORTA: Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
Thickened AVR leaflets. Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Probable
vegetation on mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate vegetation on tricuspid valve. Moderate to severe [3+]
TR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. Local anesthesia was provided by
benzocaine topical spray. The patient was sedated for the TEE.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
for the patient.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild spontaneous
echo contrast in the body of the left atrium. The LAA is
completely filled with thrombus that extends into the body of
the left with measuring 1.5x2.5 cm anteriorly and 2.1x2.0 cm
posteriorly. The right atrial appendage ejection velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s) with a 1.2x1.3 cm non-mobile echodensity
consistent with a possible appendage thrombus (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
[LVEF<30%]. There are complex (>4mm) non-mobile atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. A well-seated bioprosthetic aortic
valve is present with diffusely thickened leaflets, but without
discrete vegetation. The aortic wall appears thickened
(?abscess) with the "thickening" extending into the interatrial
septum. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. A minimally mobile 0.5x0.8cm
echodensity is seen extending from the aortic prosthesis into
the left atrium (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) c/w possible vegetation. Mild to
moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A highly mobile, 1.1x1.6cm
echodensity is seen attached at the base of the septal leaflet
of the tricuspid valve c/w a vegetation. Moderate to severe
[[**12-24**]+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: Large thrombus in the left atrial appendage and
extending into the body of the left atrium. Possible right
atrial appendage thrombus. Moderate sized tricuspid valve
vegetation and possible mitral annular vegetation. Thickened
mitral leaflets with mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Well
seated bioprosthetic aortic valve with thickened leaflets and
extensive thickening of the aortic root extending into the
interatrial septum c/w infection/abscess. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Complex non-mobile atheroma in the descending
aorta.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
