History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 70 year-old M with ESRD on HD, HTN, afib, CAD, multiple
MRSA line infections, L UE DVT (on Coumadin) and multiple other
medical problems, who was recently ([**2132-7-11**]) discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] MICU with sepsis that began on [**6-5**] and presents from
[**Hospital3 672**] Hospital today with fevers to 104 and
Hypotension. Patient had been dishcarged from the MICU to trach
facility on Vancomycin and Imipenem for MRSA pneumonia and
bacteremia. On the evening PTA, patient had been transferred to
[**Hospital3 672**] Hospital from trach facility in respiratory
distress with ABG 7.33/52/54 on FIO2 40%. Bright red blood was
also noted on trach suction, and patient reportedly had
supratherapeutic INR. At rehab, patient's urine grew out VRE,
but patient did not have foley cath and he did not receive
treatment.
.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in the setting of sepsis and hypoxic
respiratory failure.
.
In the ED, patient received Ceftriaxone 1g IV, Vancomycin 1g IV,
and Azithromycin 500mg IV, along qith 1.5 L of fluids. His VS in
the Ed were T 102, HR 68, BP 130/53, RR 18, and O2 sat 100% on
?. EKG showed no ST/T changes. CXR showed significant decrease
in left retrocardiac effusion/density. Loculated left pleural
effusion and small right pleural effusion. Patient also received
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis which showed multifocal bilateral patchy
lung opacities which could be infectious in origin, slightly
worsened compared to earlier study. Bilateral small pleural
effusions L > R, L slightly increased compared to [**2132-5-23**].
Dependent atelectasis b/l. Heavy calcifications of aorta and
coronary arteries. Calcifications at R lung apex similar to [**2131**]
study. No pericardial effusion. Metallic L subclavian stent.
Liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and native kidneys
unchanged compared to prior study. G-tube in stomach. Sigmoid
diverticulosis without definite evidence of diverticulitis.

CT abdomen: [**7-19**]
1.  Multifocal patchy opacities within the lungs that have
slightly worsened since [**2132-5-23**].  An infectious etiology is
considered.
2.  Bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
The left has slightly increased since [**Month (only) 205**], while the right is
decreased.  There is
dependent atelectasis bilaterally.
3.  Relatively unchanged appearance of the abdomen and pelvis
compared to

undetermined significance.

effusion persists.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan: 70 year-old M with ESRD on HD, HTN, afib, CAD,
multiple MRSA line infections, L UE DVT (on Coumadin) and
multiple other medical problems admitted for respiratory
failure.
.
# Respiratory failure: secondary to pneumonia gievn fevers,
infitrate, white count and eventually sputum grew seratia and
acitenobacter.  He was covered with azotreonam given oxacillin
allergy and sensitivies to both.  He will need to complete a 14
day course on [**2132-8-4**].  He also had componant of fluid overload
which was contributing and was dialiazed her with good output
which he tolerated and respiratory status improved.  HE will
continue his regular HD schedule.  He was initially started on
vanc/levoquin, but changed to azotreonam/linezolid given
mosocomial concerns given his stay at rehab and hopitals for
last 6 weeks.  He was on AC most of his stay and prior to eaving
PEEP down to 5 with good oxygenation.  Did not pass RSBI, but
tolerated spurts of Pressure support at 18/5 and passy muir
valve trials.  Ventilator can continue to be weaned at rehab.
.
# Hypotension: possibly related to hypovolemia, did improve with
fluid boluses and blood.  Also noted to be c.diff positive and
likley some degree of sepsis contributing to hypotension.  Much
improved over course of stay.
.
# C. diff colitis: c. diff positive stool here, likey related to
antibiotics he has received.  He was started on flagyl and his
diarrhea improved.  He will complete 2 weeks course on [**8-3**].
.
# ESRD: had dialysis on M/T/W to help get fluid off after
initial resucitation, but can now go back to regular M/W/F
schedule.  Procrit does was increased and transfused total of
4units of blood.  Because he only has tremporary HD catheter in
place, it was changed over wire by IR because he is difficult
access.  More permanat HD options should continue to be
evalauated as an outpateint.
.
# Anemia: likley just chronic disease, guiaic negative, epogen
increased and transfused with HD.  Cotn to follow closely.
.
# L UE DVT stable restarted anticoagulation after line re-placed
over wire.  Goal INR [**12-27**].
.
# F/E/N: continued tube feeds
.
# Access: Right subclavian temporary hemodialysis catheter with
extra port for abx, placed [**7-23**]
.
# Communication: Wife
