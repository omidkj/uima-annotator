Service: EMERGENCY

Allergies:
Cephalexin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
surgical debridement of sacral decubitus ulcer

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] on steroids,
COPD, vent dependent, as well as h/o C. diff s/p
colectomy/ostomy complicated by peritoneal infection, VAP, who
presents with abdominal pain.
.
Regarding his current presentation, history is obtained with
difficulty as patient unable to speak.  Per patient, reports
three day intermittent left lower chest/LUQ abd pain,
intermittent and sharp.  Pain worsened in severity over the
course of three days becoming constant.  Pain is worse with
inspiration.  No radiation of pain.  Denies n/v/diaphoresis, SOB
or respiratory changes.  ALso denies f/c, ST, lower abd pain.
Does have intermittent HA.  Denies trauma.  Per [**Hospital1 **],
patient had episode of LUQ abd pain not relieved by morphine on
night of admission.  Of note, pt had been treated with
levaquin/aztreonam for "pseudomonas in his sputum."
.
In the ED, VS 98.9, 103, 121/70, 14, 100%.  Patient underwent
CXR, CT abd, and received levaquin, flagyl, vanco, and lasix.
Surgery evaluated patient prior to transfer to the floor but did
not think ostomy was malfunctioning.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2157-6-2**]
from an OSH after suffering bowel perforation from C. diff
infection.  His course was complicated by peritoneal infection
with VRE requiring broad spectrum antibiotics.  After transfer,
he was subsequently intubated for respiratory distress, failing
multiple trials of extubation and trached.  He also acquired
VAP/pneumosepsis with pseudomonas tx'd with meropenem.
Regarding his MG, he was given IVIG and then maintenance
prednisone.

Past Medical History:

Imaging:
[**8-17**].  CT Abd/Pelvis.
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions with
compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes.
2. Moderate amount of ascites. No focal abscess identified.
3. Marked body wall edema.
4. Small hypodense foci of the liver, too small to characterize
but not significantly changed from chest CT of [**2156-2-4**].
5. Moderate hiatal hernia.
6. Right renal cyst.
.
CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Approximately 1-cm non-enhancing lesion within the right main
stem bronchus likely represents a foreign body or mucous plug,
although neoplastic process cannot be completely ruled out.
Recommend bronchoscopy if clinically warranted.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
3. Stable hypodense hepatic lesions that likely represent cysts.
4. Stable severe coronary calcifications.
5. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
6. Moderate-sized pericardial effusion is noted.
.
Echo.  [**8-18**].
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied.  Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2156-5-28**], moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis is now evident. The
left ventricle is small, hyperdynamic, and hypertrophic. Right
ventricular contractile function appears borderline.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26527**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 26528**] [**Last Name (un) 2902**], vent
dependent on trach with abdominal cellulitis surrounding
colostomy, left sided pleuritic chest pain, and bronchomalacia.
.
1.  Cellulitis. Patient was treated for abdominal wall cellulits
with IV vancomycin.  The cellulitis resolved, his WBC trended
down, and he remained afebrile.  He is to continue vancomycin
for a total of 10 days, last dose on [**2157-8-27**].
.
2.  Pseudomonas pneumonia.  Sputum culture from [**8-18**] is positive
for pseudomonas sensitive to gentamycin and tobramycin.  Now on
tobramycin day 5 of 14.  Last day of tobramycin will be [**2157-9-5**].
.
3.  Bronchomalacia.  Bronchoscopy showed bronchomalacia.
Patient has had mucous plugging with airway collapse over
weekend.  Was seen by IP to evaluate for possible pulmonary
stents.  They did not feel that he was a great candidate for
stenting, but will consider this as an outpatient after his
other respiratory issues were optimized.  There is no emergent
need for pulmonary stents.  He can

4.  Left sided chest pain/LUQ abdominal CT.  LFTs were found to
be normal normal and CT A/P shows no etiology of abdominal pain.
 EKG is unchanged, thoug
