weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 47 y/o man with PMH HTN and alcohol/substance
abuse, who initially presented to OSH on [**2107-2-24**] ([**Hospital 47**]
[**Hospital 1281**] Hospital) unresponsive and who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
after diagnosed with locked in syndrome. According to the
record,
as his girlfriend is unaware of the events surrounding his
admission, he went to a party and woke up the following morning
at 10 AM, at which point he said he wanted to go back to sleep,
but his friend noted some slurred speech and drooling. When he
woke up again around noon, his friend noted he was unresponsive;
just staring at her. EMS called and found him with gurgling
respirations amd BP 210/110. He arrived in ED nonverbal and with
snoring respirations; so he was intubated. Initially believed to
be substance or seizure related activity; but then CTA obtained
and official read noted large infarct involving brainstem,
primarily pons; he was diagnosed with locked in syndrome and
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of tracheostomy position.

Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to
[**2107-3-5**].

The tracheostomy tube is at the midline with its tip being
approximately 4.5
cm above the carina. There is also placement of the percutaneous
gastrostomy
with pneumoperitoneum demonstrated most likely due to surgery,
should be
further followed. Lungs are clear and cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable.

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No LV thrombus seen. Normal global biventricular
systolic function. No pulmonary hypertension or
clinically-significant valvular disease seen.

CTA IMPRESSION:

Findings compatible with basilar artery thrombosis with acute
infarctions in the midbrain and left cerebellum and possibly in
the pons. The right distal V2 and V3 segment of the hypoplastic
vertebral artery is irregular and thread-like with prominent
venous plexus surrounding it. Recommend MRA with fat saturated
T1-weighted images to exclude the possibility of dissection in
this segment.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after it was
discovered on CT brain that he had a acute infarctions in the
midbrain and left cerebellum and possibly in the pons with
occlusion at the basilar artery. He was well beyond the time in
which intervention could be performed when he arrived at [**Hospital1 18**].
He was first brought into the outside hospital on [**2107-2-24**] after
his girlfriend discovered him that morning unable to move around
11 AM. She let him sleep another 3 hours when she realized that
he still had not moved and he needed to go to the hospital.
During his course at [**Hospital1 **] he was intubated and pontinbe
stroke was then discovered. He arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2107-2-25**] at 10
pm (35 hours after first being found not moving). CTA brain and
neck showed occlusion of the mid basilar artery. It showed that
the right vertebral artery was hypoplastic. The right vertebral
artery was irregular and threadlike in the right V3 segment.
This raised concern for a dissection. MRA neck with T1 fat sats
was not performed because it would not have changed management.
He was started on aspirin 325mg daily. He had a TTE performed
that showed no intracardiac source. He refused a TEE for further
evaluation. On HD 4 he was noted to have some movement of his
right hand. This was not observed for several days, but was
again witnessed at the end of his hospital course. After
discussions with ethics, social work, and his girlfriend - a
family meeting was held in which Mr. [**Known lastname **] elected (by use of
his eyes) to have a trach and PEG placed.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a BAL that grew S. Aureus on [**2107-2-26**]. He was
started on antibiotics Vancomycine and Zosyn that were scaled
down to Nafcillin when sensitivities returned.

Antibiotic course
Nafcillin until [**3-13**]  For MSSA
Cipro, Cefepime, Flagyl - until [**3-21**]

The Cipro and Cefepime are double coverage for VAP
the Flagyl is for Aspiration
