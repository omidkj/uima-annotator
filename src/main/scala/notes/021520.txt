Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive episode at dialysis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 100984**] is a 73yo M w/hx of NHL on Bendamustine (C3D17) and
ESRD [**2-16**] DM on HD who was recently hospitalized multiple times
for pneumonia. On [**2150-4-6**] he was found unresponsive near the end
of his scheduled dialysis session. It is unclear if he had a
fever at that time. He eventually regained consciousness. He
denied any prodromal symptoms, including lightheadedness,
palpitations, chest pain/discomfort, and blurry vision. CXR
showed a new LLL infiltrate.

Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
====================
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (follicular low-grade B-cell NHL grade I,
diagnosed in [**2142**]), on Bendemustine
Adriamycin cardiomyopathy EF 30%
Aortic Stenosis
End-stage kidney disease on HD MWF
Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Gout
Meningioma
Spinal stenosis- s/p surgery [**51**] yrs ago
Osteoarthritis of the hips s/p b/l THR

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
======================
He was diagnosed in the year [**2141**] when biopsy of a cervical node
revealed follicular low-grade B-cell NHL grade I.  He has
required treatment off and on throughout the ensuing years with
multiple regimens including Leukeran, R-CVP, R-CHOP, and most
recently weekly Adriamycin.  His total dose never exceeded
450/sq
meter but in [**12/2148**] he had shortness of breath on exertion.
His
ejection fraction was 30%.  Adriamycin was discontinued.  He saw
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] from cardiology and was placed on lisinopril and
Toprol-XL.  His dyspnea is improved when he has had dialysis [**Doctor Last Name **]
to removal of fluid but he develops hypotension and therefore
this approach has its limitations.
.
Two months ago [**Known firstname **] was found to have a thrombosis in the A-V
fistula in his left arm. Her now has a right IJ line in place.

Social History:
The patient is married and lives in [**Location 1439**], [**State 350**]. He
has four children. He quit smoking cigarettes 38 years ago after
80 pack yrs. He does not drink alcohol and denies the use of
illicit or illegal drugs. He works as a kosher butcher in
[**Location (un) **].

Family History:
Mother had diabetes mellitus and died at the age of [**Age over 90 **] years.
Father died at the age of [**Age over 90 **] years. He has three brothers and
three sisters who are basically healthy. There is no family
history of sudden death or premature atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease

.
CXR [**2150-4-6**]:
1. Interval development of left perihilar opacity likely in the
left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia. Followup to
resolution.
2. Persistent reticular nodular opacity in the right lower lung
which likely represents persistent or recurrent airway
infection.
.
ECHO [**2150-4-6**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-7-17**],
mitral regurgitation appears similar, aortic valve gradient is
similar (valve area was underestimated in the prior report),
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower, left
ventricular ejection fraction appears similar although today's
images are technically suboptimal.
.
CHEST CT [**2150-4-7**]:
1. Interval development of dense consolidation in the left lower
lobe with air bronchograms and surrounding ground-glass halo,
which raises the concern for bacterial or fungal infection.
2. Bronchovascular opacity and consolidation in the right lower
lobe shows some interval improvement consistent with resolving
right lower lobe pneumonia.
.
CXR [**2150-4-7**]: In comparison with study of [**4-6**], the opacification
at the left base is somewhat less. Streaks of atelectasis are
seen at the right base and there is blunting of both
costophrenic angles. Minimal residual engorgement of the
pulmonary vessels. Central catheter remains in position.
.
CXR [**2150-4-9**]: No significant interval change with consolidation
at the left greater than right base consistent with known
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 100985**] is a very nice 73 YO gentleman with NHL (C3D17) on
Bendemustine (last dose [**2150-3-25**]), ESRD on HD, who presented with
fever and LLL infiltrate on CXR and CT.  Also hypotensive on
pressors in the MICU with concerns for pneumosepsis.  Now off
pressors for > 24 hours.
.
1. LLL Pneumonia: Patietn was admitted to the floor with
presumntive bacterial community acquired pneumonia and then
triggered for hypotension and was transfered to the MICU. He was
started on Levophed for BP, Vanc, Zosyn and Azithromycin
(Azithro was discontinued after 2 days) for hospital acquired
pneumonia in a patient with an indwelling
