Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
acute on chronic renal failure and urinary tract infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**10-5**] Left craniotomy for evaculation of left SDH
[**10-6**] Extubated
[**10-15**] placement of bilateral 8-French percutaneous nephrostomy
tubes


History of Present Illness:
82 yo Portuguese speaking male with known metastatic prostate
cancer origininally presentated to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 5503**] on
[**10-3**] with nausea, vomiting, poor PO intake, and coffee ground
emesis.  He was found to be in acute on chronic renal failure
(SCr 6.3) thought to be prerenal in etiology secondary to
dehyration; a foley was placed.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis at
[**Hospital3 **] found bilateral hydronephrosis, increased on left and
new on right with new bilateral nephrolithiasis compared to CT
[**2169-7-31**].  On admission to [**Hospital3 **] the patient was also found
to have an MI with positive cardiac enzymes, though EKG
unchanged, ie ST depressions in prior EKG. Lovenox was begun at
[**Hospital3 15402**] in setting of MI.  The patient was not felt to be a
candidate for cardiac catheterization, and his MI was medically
managed.
.
While an inpatient at [**Hospital3 **], he struck his L posterior
skull while on aspirin, plavix, and lovenox; he developed an
acute subdural hematoma and was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] in
[**Location (un) 5503**] to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) **] for a left occiptal
evacuation of acute SDH s/p mechanical fall; he received
vecuronium en route.  He then received a L occipital craniotomy
at [**Hospital1 18**] without complication on [**10-6**] and post-op CT head was
stable.  On the 14th his FeNa was 18.6. His renal function
improved on the neurosurgery service with hydration over the
enxt several days.  On [**10-7**] he was found to be hypernatremic (Na
155), free H2O was increased per NGT and 0.5NS IVF given. Repeat
Head CT showed a predominantly low fluid density within the
subdural spaces bilaterally with areas of higher density again
noted, suggestive of more acute bleeding.   On [**10-8**] dilantin
level was 12.8 which corrected to approx. 20.  He was
transferred from ICU to floor on [**10-10**] (Na 149).  C. Diff was
negative.  [**10-12**] CXR showed CHF, the patient was given lasix-
Lasix 20x1.  Pt developed respiratory distress (RR 35, labored,
but 96% 2L, other vitals normal, 5 beats VT self resolved, no LE
edema).  He improved with upright positioning and tube feeds
were stopped; stat CXR showed worsening edema, though cannot r/o
pneumonia R side. T spike 101.3 axillary and cultures were sent.
 UA revealed UTI.  He was placed on ciprofloxacin. His
creatinine increased from 1.6-->2.9.  Also he developed a cough
and appeared fluid overloaded on CXR.  His symptoms improved
somewhat with Lasix.

Past Medical History:
metastatic prostate CA (diagnosed in [**2162**]).   He underwent XRT
with Dr.[**Name (NI) 14072**], developed PSA recurrence in [**2168**] to 12.7 from
2.7 the year prior.  He underwent bilateral orchiectomy by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 75209**] at [**Hospital3 **] in [**9-28**].  Metastases to spine.

Social History:
He is married and retired.  He quit all tobacco usage when he
was 28 year old and uses EtOH rarely.

IMAGING:
.
[**2169-10-6**]: TTE: LVEF 50%, Inferior Hypokinesis, Mild MR
CT [**10-5**]: L acute SDH max thickness 2.7cm, 3mm MLS. 5mm high
density focus along L side of falx, could represent focus of SDH
vs SAH. No OSH CT available for comparison. OSH CT report max
thickness 2.3cm.
.
[**2169-10-7**] RUS
Moderate bilateral hydronephrosis.
.
[**2169-10-7**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: As before, patient is status
post left parietal craniectomy and evacuation of the left
subdural space. There is overall less pneumocephalus along the
anterior aspect of the frontal lobes and left temporal lobe
compared to a day prior with foci of air along the falx cerebri.
Low- density fluid within the left subdural space measures 7 mm
in widest dimension with persistent foci of high density mostly
near the area of craniotomy but also along the left temporal
lobe. There is more low- density fluid within the right subdural
space compared to a day prior, measuring approximately 8 mm in
largest axial dimension. The appearance of the ventricles is
unchanged with layering blood within the posterior horns of the
lateral ventricles bilaterally. There is no significant
subfalcine herniation. Extensive periventricular white matter
hypodensity and right basilar ganglia and bilateral thalamic
lacunes are unchanged.  Surrounding soft tissues again reveal
postoperative changes and skin staples in the left parietal
region. Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses demonstrate
mild mucosal thickening and mastoid air cells appear well
aerated in the setting of a right sided nasogastric tube.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of carotid and vertebral arteries
bilaterally are again noted.  IMPRESSION: Predominantly low
fluid density within the subdural spaces bilaterally. Blood in
the lateral ventricles as before.
.
[**2169-10-13**] RUS (REPEAT)
COMPARISON: Renal ultrasound [**2169-10-7**]. FINDINGS: The
examination was limited due to the patient's inability to
cooperate. The right kidney measures 10.7 cm and the left kidney
measures about 12.6 cm. There is persistent hydronephrosis
bilaterally which appears to be unchanged from the prior exam. A
partially distended bladder is identified which shows layering
amount of sludge in the dependent portion.  IMPRESSION:
Bilateral persistent hydronephrosis which appears unchanged from
the prior exam.
.
[**2169-10-14**] HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: Comparison was made to the
prior head CT dated [**2169-10-7**]. The patient is status post
evacuation of left subdural hematoma, with bifrontal subdural
collection, with crescent-shaped subdural hematoma with
hyperattenuating material along the left parietal lobe. The
overall
