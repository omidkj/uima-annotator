History of Present Illness:
46 yo M with sleep apnea, GERD, asthma, no known hx of liver
failure who presents hematemesis with bright red blood. He
states 2 days prior to admission, he had BRBPR and dark stools
and felt pre-syncopal while sitting on a toilet as if things
were "graying out". He however did not have any abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting at this time. He then went to work the day
after and continued his daily desk job at an investment firm and
did okay throughout the day. He after dinner then exactly at
9:10 pm began vomiting up a sink full of blood. He then felt
extremely pre-syncopal in teh bathroom and may have had a period
of syncope in the bathroom. His wife found him lying on the
bathroom floor awake and called 911. He then got up and layed
down on his bed. EMS arrived at that time and he walked down the
stairs and then was brought to the ED. His vitals on arrival
were 98.8, 111, 108/64, 100% on RA. He then had 1.5L of bloody
vomitus in the ED. His initial hct was 22 and he was given 2U of
PRBC and 2L of NS and his hct increased to only 25. He was
transferred up to the ICU urgently and GI plans doing a stat
EGD.
.
He states that he does not drink, no tobacco, does not use any
NSAIDS/ASA products. He does not have any hx of liver disease.
Stable GERD with diet control and prevacid.

[**6-15**] TIPS procedure:
IMPRESSION:
1. Successful placement of a tip using 10-mm x 94-mm Wallstent.
Portosystemic gradient post-procedure was 7 mm H2O.
2. Innumerous gastroesophageal varices are present, which were
embolized by using 15 mL absolute alcohol and two 8-mm by 5-cm
coils. The blood flow in the gastroesophageal varices has been
decreased.
.
CXRs: starting on [**6-11**] demonstrated mild vascular prominence,
bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis, worsened over
the week with addiotional fluid resuscitation.
.
[**6-11**]: Duplex dopplers:
IMPRESSION:
1. Very coarse and echogenic liver consistent with chronic liver
disease.
2. The portal vein is patent. However, the flow is slow and
reversed.
3. The hepatic veins appear to be patent.
.
[**6-12**]: RUQ u/s:
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Limited study. There is a new
TIPS in place. There is wall-to-wall flow demonstrated. The
velocities are 18, 21, and 55 cm/sec in the proximal, mid and
distal TIPS respectively. The hepatic veins and arteries are
patent. The portal vein could not be imaged.

IMPRESSION: Wall-to-wall flow within the TIPS, with slow
velocities as described above. This could be related to the
immediate post-procedure period, however, short interval follow
up is recommended to ensure patency.
.
[**6-13**] TIPS u/s:
TIPS ULTRASOUND: A TIPS is patent. There is wall-to-wall flow
inside the TIPS. The main portal vein is patent. There is normal
direction of flow in the main portal vein. The blood flow
velocity in the main portal vein is 50 cm/sec which is adequate.
There is no velocity gradient through the TIPS. The flow
velocities in the TIPS are as follow: Proximal TIPS 88 cm/sec.
Mid TIPS 115 cm/sec, and distal TIPS 930 cm/sec. The left portal
vein was adequately imaged and there is reversed flow.

IMPRESSION: TIPS is patent with satisfactory flow velocities. No
evidence of TIPS dysfunction.
.
Echo [**6-22**]:
Conclusions:  The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve is not well seen. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient is likely related
to high stroke volume. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo M with hx of GERD, asthma who presents with UGIB, syncope.
.
# Variceal Bleed with Blood Loss Anemia and hemorrhagic shock:
Patient presented with large amounts of hematemesis and
pre-syncope.  On arrival to the ICU, he began vomiting ~2L of
bright blood briskly. He had an emergent EGD secondary to
concern for variceal bleed with questionable NASH given obesity.
He was resuscitated with 7 units of PRBCs and 2U of FFP. He was
given Unasyn IV x 1 and an octreotide bolus and drip were
