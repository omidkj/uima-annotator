History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year-old woman with  metastatic renal cell
carcinoma diagnosed in [**3-22**] and COPD being transferred to the

As per anaesthesia and surgery, surgery was uneventful, no
complications.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU and hospital course:

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo F with a PMH of metastatic renal cell
carcinoma, COPD, chronic kidney disease, h/o DVT who presented
to the ICU after a nephrectomy. Prior to the nephrectomy, she
was mildly hypoxic, and it was felt that she would not be easy
to extubate.

## Respiratory failure: The pt arrived to the ICU intubated and
sedated. Her sedation was slowly weaned and she was extubated
successfully on the day after admission. She continued to
require oxygen by nasal canula to maintain O2 sats in the 90s.
Her hypoxia was likley secondary to chronic insufficiecny in the
context of atelectasis and volume overload. She was continued on
her fluticasone/salmeterol 500/50 and albuterol and ipatropium
nebulizer treatments prn. She will need supplemental O2 on
discharge. On discharge she was sating at 95% on 2L (pre-op
88-92% on RA).

## s/p nephrectomy: pt tolerated the procedure well. She
initially had pain at the surgical site which slowly resolved.
Her wound was C/D/I at discharge after staples were removed. Her
final pathology revealed conventional (clear cell) renal cell
carcinoma pT3a: tumor directly invades adrenal gland or
perirenal and/or renal sinus fat but not beyond Gerota's fascia;
spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding her follow-up and the results of
the lung biopsy, which after review are consistent with
metastatic disease obviating the need for a lung biopsy. She
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the next week in clinic and is
instructed to call to confirm this appt; in addition she is
scheduled for CT Chest [**1-2**].



## ileus/SBO:  patient stopped passing flatus and had worsening
abdominal distention. She then had bilious emesis x 2 for a
total of 600 cc.  An NG tube was placed which returned 200 cc of
bilious, nonbloody fluid.  Abdominal imaging showed evidence of
small bowel dilation consistent with ileus vs. obstruction.  As
patient's operation was not within the peritoneal cavity but
retroperitoneal, it was believed to be more likely ileus in the
setting of increased pain med requirements. Indeed her prolonged
hospital course was secondary to a prostracted ileaus that was
initially managed with NGT/decompression however by POD [**11-28**]
the NG was remvoed, her diet was advanced and she tolerated it
well. Of note, she consistently passed flatus and had BMs
throughout the ileus. Also, C Diff was sent which was negative.
Interval KUBs would show dilated small loops with AFLs, no free
air that would resolve thorughout her course. She was placed on
RTC Reglan toward the end of her course to expedite resolution;
GI was curbsided and beleived she has a protracted ileus that
was responded to conservative measures. In addition surgery was
consulted and recommended similar conservative measures. By the
end of her hospital course she was tolerating a regular diet and
having regular bowel movements.

## CKD: Baseline Cr 1.2-1.4. Normal increase in Cr after
nephrectomy is approximately 30-40%. Her creatinine was 1.6 on
discharge from the ICU. This had settled at 1.3 at time of
discharge. Her lytes were otherwise stable throughout; her
potassim was optimized.

## Hyperglycemia: Likely in setting of stress from surgery and
mild underlying insulin resistance. Was no longer requiring
insulin at time of discharge from the ICU.

## h/o DVT: Should likely be on life-long anticoagulation given
she had a malignancy-associated DVT. Was maintained on heparin
SC TID while in house. Will need to restart warfarin 1-2 weeks
post-op.

## Dispo: PT worked throughout her course and she successfully
ambulated with assistance. She will need to continue aggressive
PT at rehab.
