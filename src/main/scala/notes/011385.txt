Chief Complaint:
pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
77yo M with HTN, HL, COPD presenting with cardiac tamponade s/p
pericardiocentesis and drainage.  Patient presented for
scheduled echocardiogram today and was found to have a large
pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. The pericardial
effusion was noted on a CT chest performed [**2132-8-26**], at which
time a 2cm spiculated mass was also noted in the RUL concerning
for malignancy.
    Patient reports that over the past several months he has had
worsening fatigue.  He swims regularly (1000 yards in 52
minutes) and has noted that lately he is unable to swim the same
distance and it takes him much longer.  He also reports
worsening shortness of breath.  Patient presented to his PCP
with these symptoms, and labs were significant for anemia,
macrocytosis, thrombocytopenia and small IgG kappa and IgM kappa
monoclonal proteins.  Patient was referred to a hematologist who
was concerned about the potential for a lymphoid neoplasm
associated with IgM such as lymphplasmacytic lymphoma, multiple
myeloma or Waldenstroms.  The hematologist ordered a CT
chest/abd/pelvis to investigate for adenopathy and organomegaly,
and the above findings were discovered.
    Patient denies recent weight loss or change in appetite.  He
reports a brief episode recently when his right lower leg was
dragging and "not responding".  This improved after several
hours and was not associated with numbness or tingling in the
limb, speech deficits, word finding difficulties or vision
changes.  He has never had similar symptoms and they have not
recurred since this original episode.
     He reports shortness of breath which has been worsening
over the past several weeks.  He does not use oxygen at home.
He denies chest pain or palpitations.  He reports constipation,
without change in caliber of stool, melena or hematochezia.  He
denies urinary urgency or frequency, hematuria or dysuria.  He
denies bowel or bladder incontinence.  He has had two episdoes
of prolonged bleeding; one nosebleed and one post-operative
bleeding after MOHS.
.
   Today after echocardiogram showed pericardial effusion with
tamponade physiology, patient was taken to cath lab for
drainage.  Approximately 1L of bloody fluid was drained and sent
for cytology, hematology and chemistries.  Patient tolerated
procedure without issue and a drain was left in place.  Patient
was transferred to CCU for further management.

 GRAM STAIN (Final [**2132-9-2**]):
      NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
 FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2132-9-5**]):    NO GROWTH.
 ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.

TTE ([**2132-9-2**]): The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a moderate to large
sized pericardial effusion. There is left atrial diastolic
collapse. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**2132-8-26**]): 2 cm spiculated mass right upper
lobe extending normal margins worrisome for malignancy.
Mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy present, full extent
difficult to ascertain in the absence of IV contrast.  Moderate
to large pericardial effusion.

Pertinent labs/studies:
Pericardial fluid cytology ([**2132-9-4**])- POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT
CELLS, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma.

MRI Brain- pending

Discharge Echocardiogram ([**2132-9-6**])- pending. Preliminary read:
trace to small effusion without evidence of tamponade

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo M with h/o HTN, HL, COPD with RUL lung mass and
pericardial effusion recently noted on CT scan, presenting with
pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology, s/p drainage
of approximately 1L bloody fluid with malignant cells on
cytology

# Pericardial effusion - Given findings on CT scan of lung mass
and bloody fluid drained from pericardium, there was concern for
a malignant effusion. A pericardiocentesis was done with a
pericardial drain placed for two days until fluid output slowed
to a minimal level with a total of roughly 1L output from
initial drainage plus drain output. The drain was clamped and a
TTE was done 24hrs later which showed no significant fluid
reaccumulation and the drain was then pulled. Preliminary
cytology is positive for malignant cells, most likely non-small
cell lung cancer but final results and additional tissue
staining was pending at time of discharge. At the time of
discharge, echocardiogram showed small to trace reaccumulation
of fluid.  Patient had negative pulsus paradoxus on exam and JVP
was not elevated. There was no ongoing pericardial rub.

# RUL mass - Patient has been in the process of being worked up
for recent fatigue and anemia.  Outpatient laboratories were
concerning for a macrocytosis and IgG/IgM monoclonal gammopathy.
