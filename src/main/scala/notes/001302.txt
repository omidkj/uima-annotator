Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain on Exertion

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 108521**] is a delightful 75 year old gentleman with a
history of a past myocardial infarction who reports new chest
pain and dyspnea over the past couple of months. He has a past
history of atrial fibrillation with tachy brady syndrome for
which a permenant pacemaker was placed. He underwent a stress
test in [**12-30**] which was stopped secondary to fatigue and chest
pain. His ejection fraction was noted to be 39% on scan. Mr.
[**Known lastname 108521**] was admitted today for a follow-up cardiac
catheterization which revealed an 80% stenosed left main
coronary artery, a 50% stenosed proximal right coronary artery
and an ejection fraction of 35%. Due to the severity of his
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical
revascularization.

[**2187-2-8**] CXR
No previous films are available on PACS for direct comparison at
this time. There is a mild thoracic scoliosis convex to the
right. There is slight cardiomegaly with LV predominance but no
evidence for CHF. A dual chamber right sided pacemaker is
present with atrial and ventricular leads in situ, in good
location. The lungs are clear. There is minimal blunting of
posterior costophrenic angle. Degenerative changes are present
in the thoracic spine and there are surgical clips in the right
upper abdomen presumed s/p cholecystectomy.
[**2187-2-14**] CXR
AP & lateral chest views have been obtained in this patient now
demonstrating status post sternotomy, and the presence of
multiple surgical clips in the left-sided anterior mediastinum
are consistent with bypass surgery. A right-sided permanent
pacer in anterior axillary position is connected to two
intervavitary electrodes terminating in positions compatible
with right atrial appendage and apical portion of right
ventricle correspondingly. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
The right-sided diaphragm is well delineated, but the left-sided
diaphragm is obliterated and blunted. Lateral pleural sinus is
consistent with postoperative pleural effsion of moderate
degree. Review of the patient's radiologic records demonstrates
that the preoperative chest examination in PA & lateral
technique was performed on [**2187-2-8**], then demonstrating
mild cardiac enlargement, moderately widened and elongated
thoraic aorta with calcium deposits in the wall. The pulmonary
vasculature did not demonstrate any congestive pattern. The
right-sided permanent pacer with dual-electrode system existed
already at that time. Comparison of today's fourth postoperative
examination, now in PA/lateral technique, demonstrates
considerable postoperative mediastinal widening to persist, and
the left lower lobe atelectasis-pleural density is new and has
not normalized as yet. Further postoperative follow-up exam is
advised. There is no evidence of remaining pneumothorax.

[**2187-2-8**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant
system.  The LMCA was calcified with an 80% lesion.  The LAD and
Lcx both had mild disease.  The RCA had a 50% ostial lesion with
no flow limiting stenoses.
2. Left ventriculography revealed a moderately decreased
ejection
fraction (EF 35%) with global hypokinesis.  There was 1+ mitral
regurgitation.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed mild/moderately elevated left
and
right-sided filling pressures (RA mean 9mmHg, PA mean 28mmHg,
PWCP mean
13mmhg).  The estimted cardiac index was 2.0 l/min/m2.  There
was no
gradient on pull back across the aortic valve.

[**2187-2-8**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 100-115, and
rate-related left bundle-branch block. Non-specific
repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2176-2-19**] the overall ventricular rate is slightly faster and
rate-related left bundle-branch block is new.

[**2187-2-14**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 93. Left
bundle-branch
block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2187-2-9**] the
ventricular response has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic
interim change.

[**2187-2-8**] Carotid duplex ultrasound
Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

[**2187-2-9**] Pathology
Cardiac tissue consistent with atrial appendage, with myocyte
hypertrophy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 108521**] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical
Center on [**2187-2-8**] for a cardiac catheterization. This was
significant for an 80% stenosed left main coronary artery, a 50%
stenosed right coronary artery and an ejection fractionof 35%.
Due to the severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical service
was consulted for surgical revascularization and Mr. [**Known lastname 108521**]
was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. His coumadin was
stopped and his INR was allowed to drift towards normal. A
carotid duplex ultrasound was obtained which showed less then a
40% stenosis in the bilateral internal carotid arteries. On
[**2187-2-9**], Mr. [**Known lastname 108521**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. His pacemaker was interrogated
following surgery and was found to be functioning within normal
limits. He remained in atrial fibrillation which was treated
with diltiazem and digoxin for rate control. Mr. [**Known lastname 108521**] had
some postoperative delerium which resolved over several days
without further workup. On postoperative day two, Mr. [**Known lastname 108521**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e neurologically intact and was extubated. Coumadin was
started for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. Gentle
diuresis was initiated. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. Heparin was started while his INR was subtherapeutic
on coumadin. On postoperative day four, Mr. [**Known lastname 108521**] was
transferred to the cardiac surgical step d
