History of Present Illness:
76 year old female with PMH of Afib, h/o LBBB, CVA-17 years ago,
AS- 0.7 cm mean gradient of 34 and decreased systolic function
with EF of 30% in [**3-17**], presents for AVR and MAze. AS has been
diagnosed during CCU admission [**3-17**] in which patient was
transferred from OSH after presenting in cardiogenic shock with
afib. Was cardioverted/ intubated/ hypotensive and transferred
here on dopa/dobutaime. Cath that adm showed normal coronaries
with elevated blt filling pressures. RA 12 RV: 55/12 PA 55/26
mean: 38 PCWP: 31 CO/CI: 5.2/3.0 SVR: 1123. Pt recovered was
treated unsuccessfully with amio after DCCV failed, was treated
for PNA, was found to have decreased platlets (- hits), had ARF
improving by time of dc, stage II decubitus ulcer. Upon
admission on [**9-10**], patients cr was 2.1 delaying her surgery. ARF
was thought to be secondary to volume overload and decreased
perfusion. Treated with natrecor with improvement in volume
status and serum creatinine. Ultimately, patient had AVR and
Maze done [**2129-9-16**] with placement of 19mm Magna tissue valve. Note
taht echo prior to surgery showed valve area of 0.5 with mean
gradient of 56 and markedly improved LV systolic function to
55-60%. 1+ MR and 2+TR. Post-op patient reverted to AFIB, was
initially diuresed  with natrecor and lasix, restarted BB and
ACE and placed on amio drip and coumadin for afib. CR rose over
teeh next week. Swan on [**9-27**] showed CVP: 19, PA 51/24 CO: 2 SVR:
2800 (by thermodilution) then on Natrecor and lasix drip. Repeat
echos ruled out tamponade and showed again mildly decreased EF
-45-50% on [**9-27**]. Patient re-intubated on [**9-28**] for respiratory
distress secondary to CHF. Milrinone added with good effect (CI-
3.2) with some improved renal perfusion. Increased TSH t'ed with
synthroid as recommended by [**Last Name (un) **]. Extubated [**2129-10-1**].  Failed
swallow study [**10-3**]. Met alk treated wuth diamox. DCCV on [**10-4**] to
sinus. Off all ionotropes and pressors as of [**10-7**]. on Natrecor.
Pt continues to go in and out of afib. On zosyn for resistent
UTO from [**10-2**]. Patient now transferred to CCU for further
management of worsening renal function and afib.

Pertinent Results:
[**2129-10-10**] TTE:  The left atrium is mildly dilated and elongated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast (no maneuvers performed). Late bubbles seen in the left
atrium/ventricle suggestive of rapid pulmonary transit or AV
malformations. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Overall, left ventricular systolic function is
normal (EF > 55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function may be more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe
[4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2129-9-16**] Aortic valve pathology:  (Aortic) valve leaflets with
fibrosis, myxoid degenerative change and calcification.

[**2129-10-14**]  TTE:  Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
body of the left atrium. LAA not visualized (excluded/oversewn
during prior cardiac surgery). No thrombus/mass is seen in the
body of the left atrium. The right atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
right atrium or the right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. There is abnormal
(paradoxical) septal motion/position. There are complex (>4mm,
non-mobile) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. A catheter is
seen in the RA/RV/PA c/w a Swan-Ganz catheter. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2129-10-21**] TTE:  Limited views obtained on this study. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Aortic Stenosis:  Valve area 0.7cm squared with mean
gradient 49.  Pt admitted to cardiac [**Doctor First Name **] for AVR.  Started on
natrecor while waiting for AVR (supratherapeutic INR) to
decrease filling pressures.  Had MAZE/AVR [**2129-9-21**] with 19 mm
Magnapericardial tissue heart valve with resolution of gradient
post op.  Pt was anticoagulated with heparin during most of her
hospitalizaiton for clot prevention, and will be sent out with
coumadin with INR goal 2.0-3.0.

2.  Heart Failure:  Pt with chronic NYHA class 4 HF with
preserved EF of 55%.    Thus, her heart failure is likely
primarily diastolic failure with superimposed valvular disease
also complicated by chronic AF.  Pt remained fluid overloaded
and often went into pulmonary edema.  Mrs.[**Known lastname **] is negative 15 L
for her length of stay and her discharge "dry weight" is 62kg.
She required natrecor and IV lasix drips on and off during her
admission.  She also required milrinone for 2 weeks during this
admission to maintain her blood pressure.  She also had
hypertension during this hospitalization and transiently
required BP control with ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers, and prn
hydralizine (Mrs.[**Known lastname **] did become quite hypotensive with
ACE-inhibitors and these medications should be avoided in her).
Her swan #'s revealed elevated filling pressures, with pulmonary
arterial hypertension.  Interestingly, her PA pressures remained
elevated even with correction of her PCWP, implying possible
underlying primary lung disease.  Her most recent swan #'s:  PAP
41/22, PCWP 22, CO/CI 6.5/3.76 and SVR 679 (while on milrinone).
