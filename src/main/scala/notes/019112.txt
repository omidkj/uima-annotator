Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**]
Chief Complaint:
MRSA sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
trans-esophageal echocardiogram
dialysis catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
79yoM admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**10-2**] for constipation.  This
resolved with aggressive bowel regimen.  On [**10-5**], became
hypotensive to BP in 70s, with unresponsiveness.  WBC spiked to
27, fever to 100.1, with AG acidosis.  Blood cultures were
positive for MRSA.  Pt was given vancomycin, dosed by level.  He
was placed on dopamine and fluid resuscitated; dopamine was
switched to levophed secondary to tachycardia; pressors were
discontinued on AM of transfer.
.
Pt had progressively worsening renal function, as well, with
baseline BUN almost 100 and Cr 2.6-2.7.  This was thought to be
due to over-diuresis, perhaps with a component of sepsis.  Pt
could not be dialyzed due to low MAPs, and was therefore
transferred here for CVVH.  At OSH, pt also received FFP for
elevated INR and DDAVP for bleeding at site of R IJ.
.
Pt denies chest pressure, SOB, or abdominal pain.  No dysuria.
No orthopnea, PND, no lightheadedness/dizziness.  No headache.
+ BM in the last 2 days.  No changes in color of stool, no
BRBPR.  Overall feels fatigued, attributes this to lack of
sleep.  Denies fevers, chills, or sweats.

Past Medical History:
CAD s/p CABG, multi PCI
Ischemic cardiomyopathy(EF<20%)
Diabetes, on insulin.
Chronic atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin.
Status post BIV pacer/ICD
Chronic renal insufficiency (Cr 2.7-2.9)complicated by acidosis
on Sod Bicarb and hyperkalemia requiring Kayexalate treatments
as an outpatient.
Gout on Allopurinol
Anemia on Procrit


Social History:
+ tob, 15 pack-years, quit [**2122**]; smoked cigars intermittently in

.
TTE/chest echo [**10-26**]: Focused study on pacing wires.  The
inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm) c/w elevated RA
pressure.  Catheters/pacing wires are seen in the RA and RAA. No
discrete vegetation is identified (Best excluded by TEE). Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with severe global hypokinesis. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets are
moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-9-23**], the
catheters appear similar. 1. No abscess as clinically
questioned. 2. Hypoechoic mass present just deep to the left
pectoralis muscle. This exam was not done in the radiologic
department, it done by the patient's bedside. Further evaluation
is recommended with scanning by the radiologist. It is unclear
if this represents a solid mass or entity such as a hematoma.
.
CXR [**10-24**]: 1. Persistent pulmonary edema. 2. Mild cardiomegaly
with small bilateral pleural effusions. 3. Biventricular pacer
device in good position.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**10-23**]: 1. Study limited due to lack of IV contrast.
No source identified for the patient's MRSA bacteremia by
noncontrast CT scan.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left side greater than
right.
.
CT sinus [**10-23**]: Acute right maxillary sinusitis.
.
upper extr u/s [**10-22**]: No deep venous thrombosis in right or left
internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, basilic, brachial or
cephalic veins.
.
bone scan [**10-20**]: In conjunction with the Indium WBC scan
performed today, there is no evidence of osteomyelitis within
the spine. Increased activity in the clavicle on the wbc scan is
not seen on the bone scan. This is unlikely to represent
infection, and may represent marrow changes.
.
CXR [**10-20**]: New parenchymal abnormality in the lower lungs has a
similar pattern to that on [**10-12**] which cleared by
[**10-13**], suggesting a combination of mild pulmonary edema
and atelectasis accompanied by increasing small bilateral
pleural effusions. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Intended
right atrial and left ventricular pacer and right ventricular
pacer defibrillator leads are continuous from the left pectoral
power pack and project over their expected courses. A right
ventricular pacer lead fragment ends in the right chest wall.
Right PIC catheter has been removed.
.
WBC scan [**10-18**]: 1. No abnormal tracer activity within the spine.
2. Increased tracer activity in the medial left clavicle. This
may suggest infection or inflammation. The patient is to undergo
Tc-99 bone scan and correlation with the bone scan is
recommened. 3. Increased activity in the region of the right
maxilla. No clear sinusitis is seen on the panorex film. If
there is clinical concern for a periodontal process, a CT of the
sinuses is recommened with imaging through the mandible.
.
Echo [**10-12**]: Mildly thickened mitral and tricuspid valves without
discrete vegetation seen. Moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderately thickened and calcified aortic valve with mild aortic
regurgitation but no discrete vegetation. Severely depressed
left and right ventricular function.
.
CXR [**10-12**]: Left lower lobe pneumonia.
.
CT neck [**10-11**]: Severe atherosclerotic disease. No destructive
processes of the osseous structures. No paraspinal soft tissue
masses or abscess.
.
CXR [**10-8**]: Right IJ line in satisfactory position, no other
significan
