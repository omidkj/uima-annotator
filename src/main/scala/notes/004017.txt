CXR:
1. Low-lying new central venous catheter, which should be
partially
withdrawn; no definite pneumothorax.
2. CHF with bilateral pleural effusions.

Hip films (WET READ):
No cortical irregularity or disruption of trabecular lines
detected to suggest acute fracture in the left hip. Right hip
replacement and pelvis similar in appearence to previous. No hip
dislocation. Given osteopenia, dedicated left hip views vs
CT/MRI may be considered if indicated to evaluate subtle
fractures.

MRI Abd [**2162-12-15**]:
1. Two left-sided renal lesions are again identified. Overall,
the size of these lesions is slightly decreased in size since
the aforementioned recent prior MRI.
2. Arterial spin labeling sequence does demonstrate blood flow
within these lesions as noted. However, no prior ASL is
available for comparison.
3. Stable large, cystic lesion within the left adnexa as noted
above.

RENAL U/S: Limited portable ultrasound performed. No
hydronephrosis or stones in the left kidney. The right kidney
which is small could not be visualized given overlying bowel
gas. A CT abdomen and pelvis may be obtained if warranted for
further evaluation.

ECHO [**2162-8-31**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
0.7cm2). Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


CT CHEST/ABD/PELV:
1. No evidence of loculated pleural effusion or empyema, though
evaluation is limited without intravenous contrast.
2. New opacification at the right lung base, and posterior
segment of the
right upper lobe, concerning for pneumonia, possibly related to
aspiration.
3. Unchanged appearance of nonspecific focally distended loops
of small
bowel. No specific evidence of bowel obstruction.
4. Unchanged appearance of numerous calcified lesions throughout
the
peritoneum and abdomen, limited evaluation without intravenous
contrast, but suspicious for metastatic foci.
5. Unchanged appearance of predominantly cystic left adnexal
mass.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 y/o F with PMHx of severe AS & CHF admitted with urosepsis,
s/p extubation on [**2163-1-23**], had recurrent A.fib with RVR &
hypotension that responded to repeat IV fluid boluses, made
DNR/DNI on [**1-27**] with continued delirium.
.
# A.Fib/CV: Pt with severe AS & CHF with EF 50%. Pt developped
Afib with RVR c/b hypotension that responded to repeated IVF
boluses. Concern for aggressive fluid resuscitation sending pt
into pulm edema, likely to compromise resp status. Per family
meeting, pt was made DNR/DNI, no lines, no pressors.  Pt had
intermittent episodes of hypotension requiring further fluid
boluses.  Avoiding aggressive volume boluses due to tenous
volume status.  Was on Digoxin 0.125mg every other day to help
control rate.
.
#UTI/Septic Shock: Pt recently completed a 10 day course of
Zosyn for pseudomonas urosepsis, successfully extubated on [**1-23**].
WBC had trended down, afebrile. However, pt developed recurrent
hypotension likely cardiogenic etiology but was restarted on
empiric ABx prior to leaving the ICU (Zosyn/Vancomycin).  Upon
arrival to the floor, the patient remained afebrile with WBC
trending down.  Culture data was also negative.  Therefore,
antibiotics were stopped and the patient was monitored.
.
# RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE on chronic: Pt initially with oliguric
renal failure likely [**12-25**] hypoperfusion vs ATN in setting of
shock. Pt began to naturally diurese on [**2163-1-26**], then UOP dropped
in setting of hypotension on [**1-27**].  Currently, avoiding volume
overload with gentle IVF boluses.  Creatinine gradually
increasing after transfer from ICU to medicine floor.  Urine
output decreased and urine studies consistent with pre-renal
picture.  Patient given intermittent IVF given poor PO intake.
.
# RESP FAILURE: Pt was intubated on [**1-18**] due to worsening
acidosis & MS changes.  CXR with bilateral pleural effusions R>L
& pulm edema.  CT on [**1-18**] showed possible airspace disease in
RLL vs chronic changes [**12-25**] to right sided pleurodeisis. Pt
extubated successfully on [**1-23**] and has been maintaining sats on
2-3LNC.  Was given nebulizer treatments as needed.
.
# MS CHANGES: Pt with delirium likely secondary to intubation,
polypharmacy & prolonged ICU stay.  Sleep/wake cycles now very
disturbed.  Pt has been pulling out lines overnight, had to
place restraints temporary.  Was started on Zyprexa (initially
5mg [**Hospital1 **], then 2.5/5mg, then 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **] w/ PRN doses).
.
# LEFT HIP PAIN: Etiology unclear but unlikely due to infectious
source. CT neg for joint effusion, bone scan neg for pathologic
fracture/metastatic lesion. PT consulted to assist with getting
OOB.  Initially received Dilaudid in the ICU, however that was
stopped due to worry for hypotension and clouding mental status.
 On transfer to the floor, patient still with significant pain.
