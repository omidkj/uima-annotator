HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old
female with sever aortic stenosis, hypertension, congestive
heart failure, resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab who by report was
found at 1:30 on the morning of admission acutely dyspneic.
She was administered 40 mg of Lasix, 2 mg of morphine and .25
inch of nitropaste and transferred to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.
Initially she was hemodynamically stable with a blood
pressure of 170/90.  The patient was then intubated at
approximately 5:00 a.m. on the morning of admission and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Room.  She had arrived on a Dopamine drip at 5 mcs
with a systolic blood pressure in the 50s.  The Dopamine drip
was increased and nitropaste was removed with an increase in
blood pressure and an increase in her heart rate to the 130s.
 The patient received Versed for sedation.  Chest x-ray
performed was consistent with a right lower lobe pneumonia
and she was administered Ceftriaxone at [**Hospital1 882**] and
Levofloxacin/Flagyl at the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department.

On review of nursing notes from [**Hospital1 882**] it appears that the
patient was initially diuresed with Lasix 40 mg times two,
and then she had a decline in her blood pressure and several
normal saline boluses were given.  The Dopamine was started
after the normal saline boluses did not raise her blood
pressure.  The decision was to intubate her at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure.  Normal EF greater then 55%,
left ventricular hypertrophy, severe atrial fibrillation on
echocardiogram [**2104-6-1**].  She has acute pulmonary edema
approximately one time per month.
2.  Aortic stenosis.
3.  Chronic right pleural effusion.
4.  Osteoporosis being treated with Alendronate.
5.  Status post left hip fracture and repair - open reduction
and internal fixation [**2097**].
6.  Osteoarthritis - status post humeral fractures, vertebral
compression fractures.
7.  Frozen left shoulder status post surgery.
8.  Chronic anemia - likely iron deficiency.
9.  Recurrent urinary tract infections.
10.  Chronic colonization of C-difficile, multiple
admissions.  She has a history of recurrent colitis.
11.  Seizure in the setting of SIADH, which ocurred postop
after her open reduction and internal fixation and once again
in [**2103-12-3**].
12.  History of zoster on the right chest and back.
13.  Hypertension - blood pressure on medications
approximately 120/60.
14.  Dementia, mild memory problems.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Alendronate.
2.  Os-Cal.
3.  Pepcid.
4.  Lasix.
5.  Lopressor.
6.  Multivitamin.
7.  Potassium supplement.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell 8.9, hematocrit
33.3, platelets 181.  PT 12.7, PTT 28.1, INR 1.1.  Urinalysis
was unremarkable.  Sodium 138, potassium 3.6 (hemolysis),
chloride 96, bicarb 26, BUN 52, creatinine 1.3, glucose 136.
ALT 34, AST 78, CK 127, alkaline phosphatase 64, amylase 94,
total bilirubin 0.4, lipase 33.  First set of cardiac enzymes
demonstrate a CK of 127, MB of 5, calcium 8.3, magnesium 1.8.

LABORATORIES ON THE DAY PRIOR TO DISCHARGE:  White blood cell
18.5, hematocrit 33.2, platelets 262, sodium 147, potassium
3.6, chloride 115, bicarb 26, BUN 41, creatinine 0.5, glucose
92.  Calcium 7.8, phosphorus 2.7, magnesium 2.3.  Arterial
blood gas demonstrated pH 7.4, PCO2 45, PO2 of 81.

NOTABLE STUDIES:  Echocardiogram on [**2106-2-12**]
demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction at 75 to
80%, mild left atrial dilatation, normal right atrium, severe
aortic valve stenosis, 1+ aortic regurgitation.  Moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation.
There was mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension noted.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2106-2-25**] demonstrated
prevalvuloplasty, left ventricular systolic and diastolic
pressures of 205/14 and aortic systolic/diastolic mean
pressures of 100/45/65.  Cardiac output was 4.7 with a
cardiac index of 3.7.  The valve area calculated prior to
valvuloplasty of the aortic valve was 0.45 cm squared.  Post
valvuloplasty left ventricular systolic/diastolic pressures
were 210/14.  The aortic/systolic/diastolic/mean pressures
were 150/60/95.  Cardiac output/cardiac index was 3.6/2.8
positive valvuloplasty.  The valve area was calculated to be
0.7 cm squared post dilatation.  The patient received 10
milliliters of nonionic osmolar contrast for this study.

IMPRESSION:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with severe
aortic stenosis with a prevalvuloplasty valve area of 0.45
cm, which has been complicated by congestive heart failure.
She presented to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital in decompensated
congestive heart failure and hypotensive secondary to
diuresis.  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  On presentation Ms.
[**Known lastname 93056**] was hypotensive requiring support with fluids and
pressors.  Likely etiology was an exacerbation of congestive
heart failure in which she was administered diuresis.  As the
patient's cardiovascular physiology requires her to be
preload dependent, the patient could not handle this loss of
intravascular volume.  The patient was noted to have critical
aortic stenosis prior to her presentation to [**Hospital1 346**].  On echocardiogram, the patient's
valve area was estimated to be 0.5 cm.  To assess Ms.
[**Known lastname 93058**] hemodynamics a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on
[**2106-2-17**], which demonstrated a mixed venous sat of 65
to 67%, cardiac index of 3.8 to 4, cardiac output at 4.8.  It
was felt that without fixing this patient's critical aortic
stenosis, she would have a very difficult time to come off
the ventilator.  Despite the limited efficacy and a mortality
of this procedure the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy wanted to
pursue this option for the patient as this would have been
the patient's wishes.  On [**2106-2-25**] the patient was
taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and had a
aortic valvuloplasty performed.  Her peak left ventricular to
aortic gradient was approximately 100 prior to the procedure,
and was reduced to 60 post procedure.  The patient's valve
area was increased from 0.45 to 0.77 cm  squared.  Status
post valvuloplasty the patient improved clinically with
increasing urine output and improving mental status.

Throughout Ms. [**Known lastname 93058**] hospital course she had required
blood pressure support with vasopressors.  Initially she
presented with a Dopamine drip, however, this was changed to
a neo-synephrine.  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] required vasopressor support
with neo-synephrine throughout the admission intermittently.
However, Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] was noted to be adrenal insufficient
and was placed in cortical and mineral corticoids and
remained normotensive not requiring vasopressors for
approximately one week prior to discharge.  She had received
multiple fluid boluses to sustain her blood pressure prior to
the
