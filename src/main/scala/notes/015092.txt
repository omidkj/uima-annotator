altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old male with a history of type 1
diabetes complicated by chronic kidney disease, multiple
episodes of hypoglycemia attributed to insulin receptor
autoantibody syndrome now on immunosuppression who is admitted
to the MICU for altered mental status. On the morning of
admission, patient was found in his bed unresponsive by his
family. EMS was called and upon arrival FSBG was 20.  He
received 1 amp of D50 and according to EMS reports, he was
briefly responsive but again became upresponsive and was brought
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Of note, he has been admitted to the hospital multiple times for
altered mental status which has required intubation in the past.
Many times this is due to hypoglycemia and mental status
typically improves with correction of his hypoglycemia. He was
most recently admitted [**Date range (1) 20873**] to the general medical
service for hypoglycemia and mental status improved rapidly.
Prior to this admission he was admitted at the end of [**8-/2126**]
where he was followed by endocrinology and rheumatology and he
was initiated on azathioprine for his insulin receptor
autoantibody syndrome and received a course of prednisone. On
his most recent admission he was continued on his azathioprine
and prednisone without change.
.
In the ED, T<96 rectal, 193/91, 78, 14, 100% NRB. Exam showed
PERRL, clenched jaw so gag could not be performed, and he was
not withdrawing to painful stimuli. FSBG in ED was normal at
139.  Subsequent checks remained normal at 96 and 104.  Despite
normal FSBGs he remained unresponsive.  He received a dose of
narcan without improvement. He had abnormal movements in the ED,
seizures vs shivering and he received 2 mg of ativan without
significant change. On a recent trip to the ED, he required
intubation by anesthesia for a difficult airway and anesthesia
was called today. However, once anesthesia arrived, patient sat
up in bed and was conversant, A+Ox3. ROS was negative at that
time. He remained somnolent in the ED but was easily arousable
so he was not intubated as it was felt he was protecting his
airway. ABG 7.38/49/248 on 3LNC. Labs remarkable for Hct of
23(within recent baseline), electrolytes normal with the
exception of BUN/Cr of 117/6.5 (baseline Cr 5.5-6), lipase of
204, CK 367 with normal MBI (MB 11). Serum tox screen was
negative. ECG, CXR, and CT head were unremarkable. He was
initially started on D5NS @ 100 cc/hr which was changed to D5W
prior to transfer given h/o chronic kidney disease.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is obtunded. Unresponsive to pain
and sternal rub.  Cannot be aroused. ROS cannot be obtained.

Asymmetric TWI in lateral leads c/w strain pattern. Compared to
previous tracing [**2126-10-19**], no significant change.

CT head [**10-31**]: No evidence of hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**10-31**]: Patchy opacity at the right lung base with associated
pleural effusion, which could represent atelectasis, but early
pneumonia cannot be excluded.

CXR [**11-5**]: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is poor
inspiratory effort that
might explain lower lung volumes. Small pleural effusion is seen
on the left
and potentially minimal effusion on the right. No evidence of
new opacities
consistent with aspirations were demonstrated.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 year old male with a history of type 1 diabetes due to
insulin receptor autoantibody syndrome on immunosupression,
chronic kidney disease who is admitted for hypoglycemia and
altered mental status. He was initially admitted to the ICU for
monitoring.
.
1. Altered mental status: Thought to be due to hypoglycemia
given prior history of similar events. In the past, has taken
time for mental status to recover despite normal blood sugars.
Head CT negative. He was continued on D5W drip in the ICU and
his mental status improved back to his baseline. He did not
require intubation.
.
2. Hypoglycemia: secondary to insulin receptor autoantibody
syndrome.  He was continued on D5W drip until hospital day #2
when it was stopped due to rising blood sugars.  Rheumatology
was consulted who recommended continuing steroids and holding
azothiaprine. His fingersticks were checked q2 until his sugars
stabilized. The night prior to leaving the ICU, Mr.[**Known lastname 20874**]
fingersticks were elevated to 400 at which point he required
several insulin doses to return to normoglycemia (he was
asymptomatic). [**Last N
