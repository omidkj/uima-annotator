Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 78587**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2106-10-21**] for
management of her aortic dissection. As she was not a good
surgical candidate and was not interested in having a large
operation, surgery was declined. She was admitted to the
intensive care unit for blood pressure management. Her blood
pressure was well maintained on Lopressor and she was
transferred to the floor.  She was evaluated by the Palliative
Care service and she and her three daughters decided that she
would be DNR/DNI and be transferred to a [**Hospital1 1501**] closer to home.
She was asymptomatic and was discharged on [**10-24**] in stable
condition.
