Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, chest pain

History of Present Illness:
73 year old woman with h/o medullary and papillary thyroid CA
s/p radiation c/b esophageal strictures requiring monthly
dilations and h/o aspiration pneumonias who p/w SOB and CP. She
has been feeling more SOB with increased productive cough for
several days. Has felt warm but no objective fevers. This
morning felt a "heavy feeling" in her chest which lasted all day
so she came to the ED. She gets esophageal dilations approx
every 6 weeks and was due for one tomorrow. Has been having
increased dysphagia and subsequent poor PO intake.
.
In the ED initial VS were 99.0, 111, 139/76, 28, 80% on RA. Sats
increased to 90% on 6L, high 90s on 40% venti mask. EKG with
questionable lateral ST depressions. Labs notable for nml WBC
(but 90% PMNs), neg trop, neg lactate. VBG 7.45/41/65/29. CXR
with RLL infiltrate so patient given ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. Also ASA 325mg. Also given 1L NS at 75/hr.
Patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had goals of care converstion with
patient in the ED. Patient has had feeding tubes in the past and
is unsure whether she would want another one. She is amenable to
temporary noninvasive ventilatory support but would not want to
be intubated or resuscitated. VS prior to transfer were 99.7,
95, 107/68, 25, 93% on 40% venti mask.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is wearing venti mask. Has
noticeable productive cough but states that her breathing is
slightly improved.

IMAGING:
CXR [**7-17**]
IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities compatible with pneumonia in
the proper
clinical setting.  Alternatively these could be related to
aspiration given distribution.  Clinical correlation is
suggested.  Repeat exam after treatment is recommended to
document resolution.

CXR [**7-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Increasing multifocal airspace opacities, concerning for
pneumonia.
2.  New mild pulmonary edema.
3.  New left upper extremity PICC, the tip of which is in the
lower SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
73F with h/o medullary and papillary thyroid CA s/p radiation
c/b esophageal strictures requiring monthly dilations and h/o
aspiration pneumonias who p/w SOB, found to have RLL pneumonia.

# SOB: CXR c/w RLL pneumonia. Patient with h/o esophageal
strictures and aspiration, so likely aspiration pneumonia.
Continued ceftriaxone and azithromycin and sent sputum culture
which were negatve. Pt was stabilized in the MICU and discharged
to medicine floor a day later. Her O2 status while on the floor
improved and we gradually weaned her off oxygen, no fevers, no
WBC elevation. Respiratory was consulted to help with clearing
airway secretions. Pulmonary was consulted on the option of
suppression antibiotics, f/u appt [**Month/Day/Year 1988**].

# Chest pain: Likely in the setting of cough and pneumonia, and
has since resolved. Unlikely ACS given that it lasted all day,
two troponins negative, and no ischemic ekg changes. Given
hypoxia, PE is a possibility, though lower liklihood given
pneumonia on CXR. Pneumonia treatment as discussed above. No CP
while on the medicine floor.

# Dysphagia: Secondary to known esophageal strictures from
radation tx for thyrood CA. Overdue for dilation which she has
every 6 weeks. NPO for a few days while we determined what were
her options for nutrition. Unable to do dilation while in the
hospital (current condition, O2 req) so we decided to place L
PICC and begin TPN [**7-21**]. TPN would be a bridge until her medical
condition improved and she would be able to tolerate the
dilation. Palliative care was consulted to discuss nutrition
options and end-of-life issues.

# Medullary/Papillary thyroid CA: S/p radiation c/b esophageal
strictures. Thyroid scan on [**7-11**] showed new areas of recurrence
in the left thyroid bed. Patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
from oncology.

# Hypertension: Started Clonidine patch since pt will be unable
to take PO pills while she waits for dilation.

#Hypothyroidism - Stable, pt to stop levothyroxine (cannot take
it PO) until after dilation per endocrinology recs.  If she does
not go for dilation in 2 weeks, she may need to start IV
levothyroxine at home.

Transitional Issues- Please follow up with your PCP and
endocrinologist regarding your levothyroxine dose.  Per
endocrinology, she will not receive levothyroxine until dilation
when she can take it PO.  No pending labs.
