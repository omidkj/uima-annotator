Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**]
Chief Complaint:
confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
56 year old male with HCV cirrhosis (on transplant list), c/b
portal HTN, hepatic encephalopathy, peripheral edema, and
ascites, managed with diuretics and albumin infusions Q4wks,
transferred from OSH on [**1-28**] with altered mental status
requiring intubation for airway protection. He was admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] SICU for further management.
.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, CT Head/Neck were without acute
process. In the SICU, the patient was treated with lactulose and
rifaximin for presumed hepatic encephalopathy. The patient was
extubated on [**1-29**] after improvement in his mental status. A
precipitant for his symptoms remains unclear as family indicated
strict compliance with medication regimen. Infectious work-up
was initiated, though all cultures have revealed no growth to
date. No diagnostic paracentesis was performed, though only
trace ascites was visualized in the abdomen.
.
The patient had a recent admission ([**Date range (1) 43171**]) for hepatic
encephalopathy. The day prior, he underwent an EGD for which he
was premedicated with fentanyl and versed, believed to have
caused his confusion. His mental status significantly improved
and his home meds were restarted at discharge.
Currently, the patient reports that his thinking is much more
clear. He cannot remember exaclty how he arrived to the hospital
or the circumstances leading up to this admission, but he does
recall being in an ambulance. Per his nurse, he has been
somewhat "off" this evening (still not always making sense), but
this is a significant improvement since admission. He is unsure
what may have precipitated this episode and reiterates that he
was taking his medications as prescribed.
.
On ROS, he denies pain other than his baseline MSK complaints.
He denies any recent fevers/chills or other localizing symptoms.
He does endorse some recent SOB, though this is not bothering
him now. He has no CP or palpitations. He would like his Foley
out; otherwise no urinary complaints. He reports recent [**3-3**] BM
at home with lactulose as is his goal. Sore throat and hoarse
voice since extubation. Otherwise ROS negative.

Past Medical History:
- HCV cirrhosis (VL [**7-/2180**] of 262,000), s/p IFN+ribavirin in
[**2175**], genotype 1
- grade II non-bleeding varices
- thrombocytopenia
- Cervical lumbar herniated discs on chronic narcotics
- Obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP
- Hematuria status post recent cystoscopy
- Plantar fasciitis
- Meniscal tear status post repair [**2174**]
- Bilateral shoulder injuries

Social History:
He formerly worked for the Mass Water Resource in sewage and as
a painter; currently he is not working (disability paperwork has
just gone through per patient; he states this is more due to
shoulder issues than his liver disease). He lives with his
girlfriend. Denies history of tobacco abuse. He drank approx one
six-pack daily x 10 yrs, but has been sober since [**2158**] when he
was diagnosed with hepatitis C. H/o IV drug use in high school,
but has not used any illicit drugs since that time.

Family History:
His mother died at 82 from pancreatic cancer. Father died at age
78 with type 2 diabetes and colon cancer. The patient is one of
eight children. His sister died of melanoma. Two brothers with
diabetes. One brother with esophageal cancer. Nephew who died
suddenly from a blood clo

STUDIES
EKG-Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Cannot rule out ST-T
wave
abnormalities but much of it may be artifact. Since the previous
tracing
of [**2181-7-12**] the rate has increased.
.
CXR
Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.
Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.5 cm
above the level of the carina. There are low lung volumes.
Patchy right upper lobe opacity could relate to low lung volumes
and artifact, although an underlying consolidation can be
present. No additional consoli
