Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11040**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
OG tube
Central Venous Line

History of Present Illness:
55-year-old male who is s/p orthotropic liver [**First Name3 (LF) **] in [**Month (only) 205**]
[**2108**] for alcoholic cirrhosis on chronic sirolimus immune
suppression who presented with four days of shortness of breath
and cough. Cough was producing green sputum. The patient had
been started on Azithromycin by PCP 3 days prior. Denied fevers,
chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal
pain.

At OSH, initial vitals were T 97.4 BP 199/85 HR 76 RR 28 87% on
4L nasal cannula. He reportedly appeared uncomfortable and in
respiratory distress. He stated that he felt dehydrated. CXR
showed a LLL pna. Patient was put on a Non-rebreather, and was
satting 92-94%. ABG was 7.43/30/51 on an unclear amount of
oxygen.  WBC was 10.3. Trop I was 0.02. BNP was 114. Patient was
given Vancomycin 750mg IV x1 and Flagyl 500mg IV x1 prior to
transfer.

In the ED, initial VS T 100, BP 134/84, HR 96, RR 22. Patient
was 89% on NRB, and RR in 30s, so was intubated. CXR confirmed a
LLL pneumonia. Patient was given Gentamicin 80mg IV x1. He was
intubated and given Propofol for sedation. BPs dropped to
70s-80s on propofol, so sedation was switched to Midazolam and
Fentanyl.

On arrival to ICU patient was intubated and sedated, not able to
provide any ROS.

Past Medical History:
#. Alcoholic cirrhosis, s/p Liver [**Year (4 digits) **] [**2109-6-6**], [**2109-6-23**]
exploration for hematoma and fluid collection, last liver biopsy

[**2110-3-14**] no acute cellular rejection, but sig for increased iron

deposition.
-H/o malnutrition
-Prior ESLD c/b ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, grade II
esophageal varices and portal gastropathy, candidal and
bacterial (SBP) peritonitis
Post-[**Month/Day/Year **] course has been complicated by diarrhea and
malnutrition s/p extensive workup that has not found a cause.
This diarrhea is controlled with cholestyramine, Imodium,
tincture of opium, and he has [**12-31**] bowel movements a day.
#. Recurrent UTIs: Most recent cultures ([**2110-5-7**]) grew pan
sensitive kleb pnemonia and corynebacterium, but in the past has

grown out resistant strains of pseudomonas sensitive only to
meropenem ([**3-6**]), to amikacin ([**2-3**]).
#. History of Torsades while on ciprofloxacin.
- Of note: recent hospitalization [**4-5**] w/ multiple episodes of

VT/torsades s/p magnesium & cardioversion x2. At that time
thought [**12-30**] to meds (Reglan, celexa, lyrica and Bactrim) and
contribution from congenital long QTc. QTc was 499-536 despite
holding meds and given daily magnesium and potassium.
- Cardiology evaluated him ad thought not a candidate at that
time for implantable device given recent infections. Followed as

outpatient by cardiology thought pt stress cardiomyopathy,
recommended avoiding zofran.
#. Anemia with baseline Hct 27-30
#. Hydroureteroephrosis/Urinary retention: Seen by [**Month/Day (2) **] as
outpatient. Most recent OMR note: secondary to recurrent
infections and that intermittent catheterization led to
hydronephrosis. Managed w/ indwelling foley.
#. Colorectal cancer (stage unknown) s/p colectomy in [**11/2108**]
#. Cervical stenosis
#. History of C Diff colitis
#. History of depression
#. BPH
#. Chronic pancytopenia
.

===============
OTHER RESULTS
===============
CXR [**2111-9-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Ill-defined patchy opacity within the left lung base
concerning for
pneumonia. Hazier opacification in the right lung base may
represent second area of infection or possibly atelectasis.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate in size on the
right, and small on the left

Chest Radiograph [**2111-9-16**]:
FINDINGS:
In comparison with the study of [**9-15**], the degree of pulmonary
vascular
congestion appears to have decreased. There is increased
opacification at the left base consistent with pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions with some compressive atelectasis
are again seen.
