NOTE:  This is an addendum to a discharge summary.

Over the weekend, the patient remained asymptomatic
complaining of being weak, afebrile.  Her systolic blood
pressure fluctuated between 160 and 170.  The patient had a
number of loose stools and a sample was sent for Clostridium
difficile antibody which was found to be negative.  The
patient was started on isosorbide dinitrate 60 mg which did
not improve her blood pressure at all.  She failed a voiding
trial overnight on hospital day #18.  Her Foley was
reinserted.  The patient had a little over of 400 cc of
urine.  UAN cultures were sent which showed a large number of
white blood cells and some yeast.  The patient was started on
Diflucan.  The patient had a renal artery ultrasound done to
check for renal artery stenosis, however adequate study could
not be performed because the patient was unable to hold her
breath.  It was found that she had a 3 cm renal calculus on
the left side and her kidneys otherwise were normal.  We were
unable to further pursue renal artery stenosis work up at
that time because the patient is unable to lay flat and
unable to hold her breath for a while.

Urology was consulted and recommended ambulation and decrease
in patient narcotic regimen.  On postoperative day #19, an
upright chest x-ray was done which showed some stool in the
intestines.  There was no change from previous film.  The
patient continued working with PT and was making some
progress.  She walked approximately 30 feet and no complaint
of being weak.  Urology service consulted the patient and
suggested treatment of presumed fungal urinary tract
infection which was already started as well as outpatient
visit for possible left renal calculus extraction at later
point.

Postoperative day #21, the patient states that she was
feeling better.  Her blood pressure is still in the range of
130 to 160.  The patient was started on preadmission dose of
Norvasc, continued working with PT and making progress.  No
other active issues at this point.
