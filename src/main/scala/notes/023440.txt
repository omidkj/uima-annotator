Imaging:
[**2125-1-15**] tagged RBC scan: Abnormal increased tracer activity at
approximately 25 minutes consistent with bleeding in the region
of the sigmoid colon.

[**2125-1-16**] CXR: 1. Slight cardiomegaly and mild CHF/fluid overload.
2. Left retrocardiac opacity represents atelectasis or
consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  lower GI bleed - Tagged scan positive for bleed in the
[**Last Name (un) 13962**] colon, and a mesenteric angiogram showed active
extravasation from a small branch of the superior hemorrhoidal
artery in the low rectum; no embolization performed.  She had an
episode of hypotension into SBP 40s after passing a large clot.
General surgery was consulted, but considered pt too high for
surgery.  GI was eventually able to perform colonoscopy and
cauterize a visible vessel within an ulcer in the rectum that
had stigmata of bleeding.  Pt was given FFP and vitamin K to try
to correct her coagulopathy as well, and was transfused with
PRBCs.  Her Hct remained fairly stable during the remainder of
her hospitalization.  She was kept NPO, and given IV bid PPI.
Pt developed another GI bleed a few days later, but no
transfusions were required.

2.  acute renal failure - likely was [**1-18**] prerenal azotemia in
the setting of GI bleed.  With fluid resuscitation, however,
pt's Cr remained 1.3-1.6.

3.  heart failure - pt needed diuresis for fluid overload.  Pt's
po meds were held initially in the setting of mental status
change and inability to swallow pills.  She was treated with
hydralazine for afterload reduction.  A Dobhoff was eventually
placed, and pt was able to get her po meds; her cardiac regimen
was restarted.

4.  atrial fibrillation - pt developed RVR into the 180s, and
was started on an amiodarone gtt.  These medications were
stopped when pt was made CMO.

5.  heel ulcers - podiatry was consulted, and pt was given
multipodus boots, and wet to dry dressings.  She was kept on
levofloxacin and flagyl for empiric antibiotic coverage of the
wound.

6.  FEN/GI - pt had Dobhoff placed eventually and tube feeds
were started.  These were eventually stopped when pt was made
CMO.  Pt was hypernatremic during her hospital stay, as well,
and was given D5W to correct this.  Her fluid status was an
ongoing issue, and she required both IVF and lasix during the
course of her stay.

7.  Access - Pt had EJ and peripheral IVs in place, no central
line.

8.  Code - pt was initially DNR/DNI.  Multiple discussions were
had with the family, and it was eventually agreed that she
should be made comfort measures only, given her overall poor
prognosis and risk of rebleed.  Palliative care consult was
called for extra family support and to facilitate transition to
hospice care.  Pt was placed on a morphine drip, requiring
1.5mg/hour to be clearly comfortable.  All medications except
for comfort-oriented medications were discontinued.  Her tube
feeds were stopped, and the Dobhoff was removed. Pt passed away
soon after comfort measures initiated, family deferred autopsy.
