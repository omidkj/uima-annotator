HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year-old male with
a history of HIV most recent CD4 count is 380, viral load is
46,000 on HAART regimen, hemophilia, hepatitis C who
presented to the Emergency Department from home with symptoms
of dyspnea and shortness of breath.

The patient stated that these symptoms have been going on for the
past two to three weeks, but have been worsened since the last
five to six days until this morning on the day of admission
during which he felt like he was choking and gasping for air.

The patient was brought to the hospital by EMS.  He was also
complaining of increasing coughing, but denied any orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extremity edema.  The
patient reported that he had some nocturnal chills, but
denies any fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal
discomfort.  The patient also denies any urinary symptoms.
The patient has been coughing up yellow sputum on and off the
last couple of weeks.

In the Emergency Department the patient received ceftriaxone,
levofloxacin and azithromycin. He was found to be in acute renal
failure with metabolic acidosis and there was some concern of
atypical infection versus volume overload on the chest x-ray. The
patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for dyspnea and
frequent monitoring.  Infectious disease was consulted.

five pound unintentional weight loss in the last couple of
weeks.  No bright red blood per rectum.  No melena or other
complaints or symptoms.

patient occasionally has social alcohol drinking.  The
patient acquired his hepatitis C and HIV from blood
transfusion.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs temperature
97.5.  Heart rate 76.  Blood pressure 130/66.  Respiratory
rate 28.  O2 sat 92% on room air.  The patient is an elderly
ill appearing, cachectic male in moderate to severe
respiratory distress.  The patient has dry mucous membranes.
Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  He has
surgical pupils and dentures.  Lungs are diffuse wheezes and
with bilateral crackles throughout.  Heart is S1 and S2 and
has 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard best on the
left sternal border radiating upward.  Belly is scaphoid,
nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly noted.  The
patient was alert and oriented times three, conversant and
able to speak in short sentences.  Extremities show no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Warm and well perfused.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 20.9,
hematocrit 40.3, white count is notable for neutrophils 34,
benzos 15, lymphocyte of 30 and atypical lymphocytes 14.  A
venous blood gas was significant for 7.24/36/31, lactate of
3.9.  Blood culture was drawn and was pending at that time.
chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe patchy infiltrates
consistent with atypical infection versus PCP given history
of HIV versus volume overload.  Urinalysis shows large amount
of blood, positive nitrites, no leukocytes, 3 red blood
cells, 5 white blood cells, 10 granular cast and 2 hyaline
casts.  Urine culture was pending at that time.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Hypoxia:  The patient was initially started on ceftriaxone
and azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia with modest
improvement in his respiratory status and he was briefly placed
on Bactrim for the possibility of Pneumocystis pneumonia, but the
decision was made to stop Bactrim secondary to the patient's
preserved CD4 count in [**Month (only) **] of this year.  Vancomycin
was added to his regimen with more clinical improvement although
interval chest x-rays did get better.  The patient was continued
on these three antibiotics until his discharge, although his
respiratory status was not totally stable yet, but the patient
insists leaving even against medical advise. Because of the
difficulty of setting up VNA for intravenous antibiotic, the
patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to oral medications,
including linazolid po upon his discharge and will be following
up with his primary care physician on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] to recheck his
respiratory status.

2.  Acute renal failure of unclear etiology:  Given the brown
casts that was found in the urine this most likely is ATN and
could be due to his HAART medication, therefore the patient
was taken off his HAART medication.  His renal creatinine
slowly improved over time throughout his hospital stay.

3.  Hemophilia:  The patient was stable on his biweekly
factor 8 replacement.

4.  Anemia:  Stable on his Epo injection regularly.

5.  Question of C-diff infection:  The patient developed
loose stools and with multiple episodes throughout his stay.
Flagyl was started and it was ordered to have his stool sent
for sample.  Unfortunately the patient stopped passing stool
after he transferred out of the MICU and a stool sample was
not able to be obtained, although the patient was empirically
treated with Flagyl and will continue finishing his Flagyl
treatment as an outpatient.

6.  Mental status change:  The patient had episodes of
confusion while in the Intensive Care Unit.  The head CT was
obtained, which was unremarkable.  Upon coming to the floor
the patient's mental status resumed to his baseline and was
alert and oriented times three again.

7.  Hypertension:  The patient was originally on his
outpatient medication of Metoprolol and Verapamil.  We
increased his Metoprolol from 37.5 b.i.d. to 50 mg b.i.d.
with good improvement of his hypertension.
