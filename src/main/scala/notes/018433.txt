Service:  [**Hospital1 **] B

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
male with type 1 diabetes mellitus that has been uncontrolled
for many years.  Diabetes mellitus is complicated by
gastroparesis, autonomic neuropathy, renal failure, diabetic
eye disease, and peripheral vascular disease.  The patient
presented with a change in mental status and hyperglycemia.
The patient denies dysuria, >.....<, chest pain.  There was a
question of recent diarrhea.  The patient was not sure if he
had taken his glargine the evening before.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin dependent complicated
by a gastroparesis, autonomic neuropathy, renal failure
(status post renal transplant times two, now with baseline
creatinine 1.4 to 3.2).
2.  Right eye blindness with metrectomy.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease (status post multiple toe
amputations).
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy, status post transurethral
resection of the prostate.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg per day.
2.  Protonix 40 mg per day.
3.  Neurontin 100 mg twice a day plus 600 mg before bed.
4.  Multivitamin.
5.  Celexa 20 mg per day.
6.  Prednisone 10 per day.
7.  Tacrolimus twice a day.
8.  Lasix.
9.  Metoprolol.
10. Midodrine.
11. Insulin.
12. Calcium.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives in [**Hospital3 **]. Denies history of
alcohol or intravenous drug use.  Patient is a pipe smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.8.  Blood pressure 129/41.  Pulse of 40.  Oxygen
saturation of 95% on room air.  In general, the patient was
somnolent, disoriented and babbling.  His mucosa were
extremely dry.  His right eye was noticeably status post a
metrectomy.  His extremities were significant for bilateral
superficial healing ulcers with erythema but no induration,
no necrosis or discharge.  He was status post multiple toe
amputations.  His exam was otherwise unremarkable.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  His CBC was significant for a white
blood cell count of 12,900.  Hematocrit was 37%.  His
chemistry was notable for a sodium of 121, chloride 81, BUN
79, glucose of 1025, potassium 5.2, bicarbonate 15,
creatinine 2.5.  His urine was significant for large amount
of glucose.  His cardiac enzymes were also elevated with an
MB index of 8.2.

ADMISSION STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed a normal
sinus rhythm with rate in the 80s and T waves that were
flattened diffusely compared with old studies.  Chest x-ray
was unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By system:

1.  Endocrine:  The patient was admitted in diabetic
ketoacidosis.  An insulin drip was started and blood glucose
was brought under control over the next 24 hours.  The
patient was then switched back to glargine Humalog regimen
and then discharged from the Intensive Care Unit on hospital
day number three.  The patient was maintained on glargine at
16 and Humalog sliding scale.  The patient was given the
option of calculating his glycemic index, but the patient
preferred to defer it to the sliding scale during this
admission.

2.  Cardiovascular:

A.  Ischemia:  The patient was found to have elevated cardiac
enzymes including an elevated MB index on admission.
Decision was made to correct metabolic abnormalities and
proceed with catheterization once blood sugars and creatinine
were stabilized.  The patient was taken to cardiac
catheterization on hospital day number five.  Catheterization
identified no flow limiting lesions.

B.  Pump:  Echocardiogram on hospital day number two revealed
a 35% ejection fraction, [**1-11**]+ mitral regurgitation.  Patient
was started on an ACE inhibitor and restarted on Lasix.

C.  Hypertension:  Patient was started on an ACE inhibitor
after creatinine was found to be stable.  The patient also
restarted on intravenous Lasix.  The patient refused to take
beta-blocker secondary to report of a hypotensive episode
while on beta-blockers.  Of note, this was more likely
related to his autonomic neuropathy.  Nevertheless, the
patient wishes to not take a beta-blocker were respected.

3.  Renal:  The patient is status post two renal transplants
and was maintained on tacrolimus and prednisone during this
admission.  Tacrolimus level was checked and was found to be
therapeutic.  Patient now has chronic renal insufficiency.
On admission, creatinine was 2.5 which is consistent with
previous baseline; however, the patient was felt to be dry
and this creatinine was felt to reflect some acute renal
failure secondary to dehydration.  Creatinine decreased after
hydration.  Patient received hydration and Mucomyst and a
peri cardiac catheterization, and creatinine remained stable
after catheterization.  Creatinine increased from a nadir of
0.9 on hospital day number nine to 1.3 on discharge after
restarting of Lasix on hospital day number nine.

4.  Infectious Disease:  The patient developed sepsis on
hospital day number six and required intravenous pressors,
intubation and readmission to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.  Patient was then stabilized and was discharged back to
the General [**Hospital1 **] on hospital day number nine.  Right IJ
catheter tip and blood sugars grew Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  Patient was treated with intravenous
vancomycin.  Patient also found to have vancomycin resistant
enterococcus on urinalysis, but analysis was negative for
white blood cells and nitrates.  On informal consultation,
Infectious Disease felt that this reflected colonization
rather than infection and felt treatment was not warranted.
Healing ulcers on tibial surfaces bilaterally remained stable
and showed no evidence of recurrent cellulitis during this
admission.

5.  Vascular:  On hospital day number nine, patient developed
swelling in the right arm, greater than the left.  A thrombus
was found in the right IJ at the site of the former infected
central venous catheter.  Patient was started on a heparin
drip and then started on Coumadin.  On hospital day number
13, INR was found to be therapeutic and heparin was
discontinued.

6.  Autonomic neuropathy:  Midodrine held in the setting of a
myocardial infarction during this admission.

7.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  During this
admission, the patient was maintained on a diet that met
requirements for his diabetes, renal and cardiac risk
factors.  Electrolytes and fluids were repleted as necessary.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone:  Patient was placed on a rapid prednisone
taper, 40 mg on the 14th, 20 mg on the 15th, 10 mg per day
from then on.
2.  Vancomycin 1000 mg per day times two weeks.
3.  Captopril 25 mg three times a day.
4.  Furosemide 40 mg twice a day (of note, the patient was
felt to have peripheral edema that was likely to take several
weeks to resolve).  Outpatient physicians were cautioned to
avoid assessing volume status by level of peripheral edema.
It was felt that attempting to decrease peripheral edema too
rapidly would result in dehydration and elevation in the
patient's creatinine.   Outpatient physician's were instead
instructed to assess In's and Out's carefully and adjust for
furosemide dosing accordingly.
5.  Warfarin 5 mg po q.d.
6.  Atorvastatin 10 mg po q.d.
7.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
8.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
9.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg t.i.d.
10. Neurontin as on admission 100 mg po b.i.d. and 600 mg
before bed.
11. Tacrolimus 2 mg po b.i.d.
12. Oxycodone 3300 every six hours as needed for pain.
13. Multivitamin.
14. Folic acid 1 mg po q.d.
15. Celexa 20 mg po q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 1, as complicated by
gastroparesis, autonomic neuropathy, renal failure, right eye
blindness with metrectomy (diabetic eye disease), peripheral
vascular disease.
2.  Myocardial infarction.
3.  Acute renal failure.
4.  Sepsis.
5.  Deep vein thrombosis.
6.  Chronic pain.
7.  Peripheral neuropathy.
8.  Autonomic neuropathy.
9.  Hypertension.
