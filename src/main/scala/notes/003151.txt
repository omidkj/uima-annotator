Reports-
EKG [**2130-2-8**]
Atrial fibrillation. There is a late transition with tiny R
waves in the
anterior leads consistent with possible prior anterior
infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
atrial
fibrillation is new.

HISTORY: New central line, check position or complications.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2129-9-11**]. Tip of the new
right
internal jugular line projects low over the SVC. No
pneumothorax, mediastinal widening or pleural effusion. Heart
size is top normal. Lungs are clear.
Angiogram- mesenteric
-no active source of bleeding visible

Doppler LE
INDICATIONS: 88-year-old female with GI bleed status post
angiographic
procedure and right-sided groin bruits. Please rule out hematoma
or fistula.

FINDINGS: Limited arterial and venous duplex was performed in
the right
femoral location. The common femoral artery is patent with
biphasic waveforms and uniform color saturation. The profunda
and proximal superficial femoral artery also patent with
biphasic waveforms.

The common femoral and proximal saphenous are patent without any
evidence of fistula. There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm and
no significant hematoma.

IMPRESSION: Essentially normal Duplex of the right femoral
vessels. No
source of the bruits identified.






Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
The patient was admitted with hypotension and ongoing bright red
blood per rectum. Hematocrit on admission was 23.7. She was
bolused with IV fluids and transfused 2 units of packed red
blood cells, and her blood pressure stabilized. Her
post-transfusion hematocrit was 37.2. GI and surgery were
consulted upon admission. On hospital day one, per
GI/interventional radiologist, she was taken directly to
angiography, but no bleeding source was found. Upon removal of
her femoral sheath, she developed groin pain and a bruit.
Ultrasound was obtained, which showed no atriovenous fistula or
pseudoaneurysm, with patent vessels. She was prepped for
colonoscopy, but as she had no more bleeding over 36 hours.
Therefore, GI decided not to pursue a scope during this
admission. Given her prior history of diverticular bleed, it is
likely that this episode was also from diverticula. Her
hematocrit at the time of floor transfer was 31.0, stable over
36 hours. Her blood pressure had also stabilized and was
increasing to SBPs 150s, with a plan to restart home BP
medications on the floor.

Medicine floor course:
After transfer to the floor, the patients blood pressure
increased overnight to the 170s. She was given captopril and
metoprolol short acting. Her hematocrit remained stable
overnight at 32.2 and then she was restarted on her home blood
pressure medications of lisinopril and verapamil ER. She had no
abdominal pain and her vitals remained stable, but
