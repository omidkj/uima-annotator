Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 54-year-old female with a complex past medical
history including hepatic sarcoidosis and nodular regenerative
hyperplasia complicated by portal hypertension, portal
gastropathy and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, last
admitted four days ago for TIPS procedure performed for
increasing transfusion requirements, now admitted for altered
mental status. Per her family, she was not taking her lactulose
in the last several days. She went to sleep last night in her
usual state of health, and this morning, her husband found her
difficult to arouse and she had a left sided hemiparesis. She
was brought to an OSH where she had a head CT which was negative
for acute bleed. Her mental status worsened however, as did her
left hemiparesis and she became unarousable, even to pain. She
was intubated for airway protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
When the patient arrived here, she was found to still not be
responding to pain, temp 100.5, other vitals stable. Ammonia
225. A neurology consult was obtained, and a repeat head CT/CTA
was negative for acute process. Neurology felt that this was
likely all secondary to marked encephalopathy, as she has had a
history of these types of episodes when she stops taking her
lactulose. The left-sided hemiparesis is consistent with
unmasking of her old infarct in the setting of acute
encephalopathy and EEG was negative for seizure activity. They
recommended an lumbar puncture to rule out infectious etiology,
which was essentially clean.
.
On review of her past medical history, she has a history of
hepatic sarcoidosis and nodular regenerative hyperplasia
complicated by portal hypertension, portal gastropathy,
recurrent GI bleeding, COPD, pulmonary hypertension,
hypothyroidism, Raynaud's, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with
an EF 15-20%. Her sarcoidosis was diagnosed in [**2104**] after liver
biopsy performed to evaluate chronic nausea and vomiting.
Colonoscopy in [**6-17**] demonstrated sigmoid diverticulosis, AV
malformations of the cecum and ascending colon, and grade 3
internal hemorrhoids with superimposed AV malformations. On [**8-17**]
an EGD at [**Hospital1 2177**] demonstrated grade 2 esophageal varices, portal
hypertensive gastropathy, and gastric cardia varices. She also
has CMY with her last echo demonstrating an EF of 15-20% and a
p-mibi that confirmed an EF of 23% with no ischemic changes. She
was started on prednisone 20 mg a day for questionable cardiac
involvement of sarcoidosis. On [**1-30**], she was admitted to the
transplant surgery service at [**Hospital1 18**] and underwent a TIPS
procedure with no complications.
