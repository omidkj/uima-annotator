Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**]
Chief Complaint:
vertigo and imbalance

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Suboccipital decompression/craniotomy
Colonic mass resection
Diagnostic cardiac catheterization
IVC filter placement

History of Present Illness:
Per admitting resident: 73 year old R handed woman with PMH of
HTN who p/w acute onset vertigo and nausea. She had no weakness,
no visual cuts. She thought she may have had mild incoordination
BL; some trouble with fine movements. However, she could hold
objects and walk normally. She denied HA.
.
She went to OSH where BP 127/75 HR 84 and she was neurologically
intact. A CTA head/neck was performed and showed occlusion of R
vertebral, mild stenosis of mid basilar artery and short segment
stenosis P2 segment of L PCA. A brain MRI revealed bilateral
cerebellar stroke and small punctate cortical infarcts R and L
occipital lobes. Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.
.
Per accepting resident, 73 yo female with h/o HTN admitted with
acute vertigo found to have bilateral cerebellar CVAs.  She was
taken to the OR by neurosurgery on [**2126-11-27**] for posterior fossa
decompression and EVD. Her hospitalization has been complicated
by Afib with RVR requiring IV metoprolol and PO metoprolol for
rate control. She also had an NSTEMI with a peak trop of 0.22
[**2126-11-25**] most likely in the setting of demand ischemia. She also
developed BRBPR during this hospitalization, and was taken to
colonoscopy on [**2126-12-3**] which showed a colonic mass which was
sent for biopsy. General surgery was consulted for possible
surgical resection.  Also, today, patient was noted to have a
leukocytosis, though she has not had a fever. 2 days ago, she
had a mild fever to 100.0.
.
Currently, the patient denies any CP, dyspnea, abdominal pain,
palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  She
states from a neurological standpoint she is doing better.  She
has been up in the chair as well.  She is tolerating a regular
diet.  She has a basic understanding of all of her acute
illnesses, and she is aware that she has a colonic "polyp/mass".
 She is currently prepping for a colonoscopy.
.
Of note, patient reports she had not been taking any medications
prior to admission.  She actually wasn't following with a PCP at
all fairly recently.  No colonoscopy recently either.  She
denies any CP at home.
.
ROS:
The patient denied visual difficulty, hearing changes,
difficulty speaking, language problems, memory difficulty,
difficulty swallowing, paresthesias, sensory loss, weakness, or
falls.
.
The patient denied fever, wt loss, appetite changes, cp,
palpitations, DOE, sob, cough, wheeze, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, abd pain, fecal incont, dysuria,
nocturia, urinary incontinence, muscle or joint pain, hot/cold
intolerance, polyuria, polydipsia, easy bruising, depression,
anxiety, stress, or psychotic sx.

Labs on discharge:
.
Imaging:
.
From OSH: CTA head/neck was performed and showed occlusion of R
vertebral, mild stenosis of mid basilar artery and short segment
stenosis P2 segment of L PCA.
.
A brain MRI revealed bilateral cerebellar stroke and small
punctate cortical infarcts R and L occipital lobes
.
CT head [**2126-11-26**]: IMPRESSION: Areas of hypodensity within the
cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally corresponding to area of
acute infarct seen on the outside hospital MRI with mass effect
on the 4th ventricle. No significant change in size of the
lateral ventricles and 3rd ventricle since the prior study. No
acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of
the mid to distal anterior septum, and the distal anterior wall,
apex, and distal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: No apparent intracardiac source of embolism.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with
mid LAD disease. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mo
