Chief Complaint:
fall from standing, new paraplegia and sensory loss


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
7-26-2012Anterior cervical diskectomy C6-C7 and fusion

C4, C5, C6 and superior C7 with instrumented fusion
[**8-6**] IVC filter placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo M transferred from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital ED to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for reported paraplegia and sensory loss below level of
T8 after fall this morning. Patient is intubated and sedated on
exam, no family members available for collateral; all history is
second-hand.

Per report, patient had a fall from standing position while
outside grocery store this morning, hitting his forehead on the
sidewalk. Unclear whether this was mechanical fall vs. syncope.
He was found by grocery store manager; at the time he had normal
mental status but complained of bilateral leg paralysis and
numbness from above his bellybutton down to his feet. He was
transported by EMS to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital where CT head, C-spine and
T-spine were performed. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] by
helicopter for further evaluation. During the flight patient
became agitated, so he was given fentanyl and ativan.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED patient was lethargic, sedated,
responsive only to pain, GCS 8 (2,1,5). He was intubated for
airway protection prior to imaging. A code cord was called.
Repeat C/T spine CT showed no spine fracture, hemorrhage, canal
stenosis; however, read of OSH spine CT revealed widening of
canal at C6-7. Follow-up MRI was ordered. Neurosurgery was then
consulted to evaluate patient.

On initial exam by neurosurgery, GCS was 7 (1,1,5). Patient was
intubated, exam was performed after pt off propofol x5 min
(although had received succinylcholine bolus 20 minutes prior to
exam). He was grimacing to noxious stim, localizing to noxious
stim in bilateral upper extrem, and triple flexing bilateral
lower extrem to noxious stim. Toes were upgoing on left, mute on
right. He had flaccid rectal tone.

Pertinent Results:
NONCONTRAST HEAD CT ([**2135-7-31**], [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital): There is no
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or territorial infarction.  The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. The
basal cisterns are patent and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation
is preserved. No fractures are identified. The visualized
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities
are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.

NONCONTRAST CT C-SPINE ([**2135-7-31**], [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital): There is no
fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine. There is no
prevertebral soft tissue edema and the atlanto-occipital joints
are intact. There are multilevel degenerative changes with
anterior and posterior osteophytes with moderate spinal canal
stenosis, worst at C5-6 and C6-7. There is disc bulge narrowing
the thecal sac at C6-7. There is fusion and ossification of the
PLL at C5/6 .There is widening of the disc space at C6/7,
recommend MRI for further evaluation. There is no cervical
lymphadenopathy. There are mild atherosclerotic calcifications
in the carotid bifurcations. The thyroid gland is normal.
IMPRESSION:  No fracture of the cervical spine.  Multilevel
degenerative changes as described above.There is widening of the
disc space at C6/7, recommend MRI for further evaluation.

NONCONTRAST CT C/T-SPINE ([**2135-7-31**], [**Hospital1 18**]):
1. No fracture of the thoracic spine. Multilevel degenerative
changes.
2. 4 mm left apical nodule. If this patient is high risk, this
can be followed up with CT chest in 12 months.

MRI C/T/L-SPINE ([**2135-7-31**]):
1. Abnormal widening of the C6/7 disc space, with associated
anterior STIR hyperintensity at the same level.  This suggests
traumatic injury at this level, with anterior longitudinal
ligament tear.
2. Spinal cord signal hyperintensity at C6/7. In the setting of
the extensive degenerative change at this level, some component
of the signal change is likely related to chronic myelomalacia.
However, a component of
trauma-related intramedullary edema is not excluded.
3. Degenerative findings of the spine, most notably in the
cervical spine.

CT head [**2135-7-31**]: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
territorial infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in
size and configuration.  The basal cisterns are patent and
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  Opacification
of the paranasal sinuses is consistent with interval intubation.
 There is no fracture.  The mastoid air cells and middle ear
cavities are clear.

CXR ([**7-31**]): In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
the tip of the endotracheal tube now measures approximately 2.7
cm above the carina.  NG tube extends at least to the upper
stomach, where it crosses the inferior margin of the image.
There is opacification at the left base with elevation of the
hemidiaphragmatic contour.  The appearance is consistent with
pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.

TTE ([**8-1**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR ([**8-1**]): In comparison with the study of [**7-31**], the left base
is somewhat clear with the hemidiaphragm well defined.  The
pulmonary vessels are indistinct, suggesting elevated pulmonary
venous pressure.  Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 2.2
cm above the carina and the nasogastric tube extends well into
the stomach.
