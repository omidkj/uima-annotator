Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2190-8-12**] Cardioversion

[**2190-8-17**] Coronary artery bypass graft x1 (left internal mammary
artery > left anterior descending) Mitral valve repair (28 mm
annuloplasty ring)


History of Present Illness:
78F presented to OSH last week with c/o chest pain.  She ruled
in for NSTEMI with troponin peaking at 13ng/mL.  Cardiac cath
showed severe two vessel coronary artery disease with a 90%
lesion in a heavily calcified LAD and total occlusion on the
right.  The PDA is supplied via collaterals from the LAD,
therefore stenting of the LAD was considered high risk.  She is
transferred for CABG evaluation.  She has been taking Plavix.
Additionally, she presented to the ED with new onset rapid
atrial fibrillation, which was rate controlled with IV
Diltiazem, digoxin and Lopressor.  Initial hematocrit was 30%,
GI was consulted and recommended follow up as an outpatient
following resolution of
cardiac issues.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
-No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
-No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
-No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
-The coronary sinus is mildly dilated (diameter 1.1cm). No
bubbles/saline noted in CS during interrogation for persistent
LSVC.
-Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %).
-There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
-The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
-The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe restriction of the posterior mitral valve
leaflet. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae attached to the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral
regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect).
-The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
-There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
-There is no pericardial effusion.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified of the results at the time of the
study.

POSTBYPASS: On phenylephrine, a pacing briefly. Prior to weaning
from cpb, there was moderate to severe mitral regurgitation,
which reduced to 1+ off bypass. Two small jets of mitral
regurgitation were seen. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6507**] was able to image the
regurgitation using 3-D. LV fuction was normal. The annuloplasty
ring was well-seated without rocking and with only a small
perivalvular leak. The AI remains 1+ and the aortic contour is
normal post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital for surgical evaluation.
Her lisinopril was stopped for creatinine elevation of 1.6 up
from 1.1 on labs from outside hospital - noted for acute kidney
injury on admission.  Her creatinine was monitored
preoperatively and progressively trended down.  Additionally on
admission labs, she  had urine culture that revealed E coli that
was treated with ciprofloxacin.
She was continued on heparin for atrial fibrillation, and
continued on digoxin and diltiazem for rate management.  Then on
[**2190-8-12**] she underwent transesophageal echocardiogram to
evaluate valve and rule out any clot prior to cardioversion.
She underwent cardioversion and converted to sinus rhythm.  She
was started on amiodarone and digoxin was stopped, and continued
on heparin until right groin presented with hematoma.  She
underwent ultrasound that ruled out pseudo aneurysm and vascular
surgery was consulted.  She did have drop in hct from admission
at 32 down to 24.8 and was transfused with packed red blood
cells, and responded appropriately.  Her groin remained stable
until she was brought to the operating room on [**8-17**] for coronary
artery bypass graft and mitral valve repair surgery.
See operative report for further details.

Post operatively she was transferred to the intensive care unit
for management.  She had post operative bleeding that was
treated with blood products with improvement.  She remained
intubated overnight on propofol and neosynephrine for blood
pressure management.  The morning of postoperative day one she
was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without complication.  She was started on lasix for
diuresis but remained on neosynephrine until that afternoon, of
which then betablockers were started.  She remained in the
intensive care unit for monitoring and on post operative day two
was restarted on amiodarone for preoperative atrial fibrillation
and coumadin.  She continued to improve and was ready for
transfer to the floor.  Physical therapy worked with her on
strength and mobility.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed without complication.

She is to be discharged to rehab on telemetry with history of
preoperative atrial fibrillation as well as IV lasix with
significant post operative residual edema.

***Plavix may be restarted per her cardiologist ( please check
with him prior to her discharge from rehab).Target INR for A Fib
2.0-2.5. First INR check day after discharge.
Cleared for discharge to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 8957**] on POD 6.
All f/u appts were advised.
