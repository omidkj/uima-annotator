History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2392**] is a 82 year old male with 3 week history of
worsening chest pain and dyspnea on exertion. Nuclear stress
testing in [**2175-1-28**] showed depressed LV function at 37%, with
mild aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation.

cardiac surgical intervention.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 98.2, 174/86, 76, 20, 95% SAT on room air
General: WDWN elderly male in NAD
HEENT: Oropharynx benign, EOMI
Neck: Supple, no JVD
Lungs: CTA bilaterally
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, normal s1s2, 2/6 systolic murmur
@ apex
Abdomen: Soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: Warm, no edema
Pulses: 2+ distally
Neuro: Alert and oriented, CN 2- 12 grossly intact, no focal
deficits noted
Other: penis absent

Pertinent Results:
[**2175-3-17**] Chest x-ray: There is cardiomegaly with LV enlargement,
pulmonary vascular congestion, interstitial edema and fissural
fluid, representing CHF. The lung volumes are low with bibasilar
atelectasis, but no focal consolidation. There is no pleural
effusion. There are atherosclerotic changes involving the
thoracic aorta.
[**2175-3-18**] ECHO: The left atrial volume is markedly increased
(>32ml/m2). The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the
basal to mid inferolateral wall and mid inferior wall. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2392**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation - see result section.
He remained stable on medical therapy and was noted to have some
episodes of atrial fibrillation on telemetry. Given his partial
penectomy, the urology service was consulted for placement of
foley catheter. His preoperative course was otherwise
unremarkable, and he was cleared for surgery. Given his hospital
stay was greater than 24 hours, Vancomycin was used for
perioperative antibiotics. On [**3-20**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed
four vessel coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. For
surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
Following the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. He weaned from
inotropic support without difficulty and started on beta
blockade. He remained in atrial fibrillation and was eventually
started on Coumadin and Amiodarone. He otherwise maintained
stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative
day three. Empiric Fagyl was given for persistent loose stools.
Over several days, his diarrhea improved, the flagyl was
discontinued with no further diarrhea.  He remained in a rate
controlled atrial fibrillation. Prior to discharge, arrangements
were made with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11427**] to manage Coumadin as an outpatient.
He was ready for discharge home on POD 5 with VNA services.
