History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 76901**] is an 83 y/o M with a
h/o AF not on coumadin, CHF with an EF of 20%, severe AS, RA
(chronic prednisone 5), CKD (baseline Cr around 1.3) and ? COPD
on adviar with  who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on
[**2168-12-26**] after having episodes of painless BRBPR at home.  On
[**2168-12-26**] he was admitted to the ICU at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and underwent
a colonoscopy that day which showed diverticuli but did not
reveal any active bleeding.  On [**12-26**] his HCT dropped from 31.3
to 27.7 and he was give PRBCs.  The night of [**12-27**] he had more
BRBPR and his HCT drifted down to 26, but he remained
hemodynamically stable.  On [**12-28**] he underwent another
colonoscopy with no localized source of bleeding but did show a
large amount of blood in the colon.  Also in the course of the
work up of his GI bleed he underwent a CTA of his abdomen on
[**12-28**] with no active GI bleeding seen. Got total of 7 units PRBC
to maintain Hct ~ 27 throughout his stay at [**Hospital1 18**], Surgery was
also consulted who agreed with the CTA and recommended a
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] if the family wished to pursue a further work
up or aggressive treatment such as angio for embolization or
surgical resection. Prior to transfer he past 400 mL BRBPR with
associated clots. He reports [**2-7**] bowel movements per day.
.
Also during his stay at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] given his history of
systolic heart failure and murmur heard on exam he had an
echocardiogram which showed an improvement in his EF to 55%, but
significantly worsening of his aortic stenosis. He notes some
shortness of breath with exertion at baseline but notes he
mobility is limited by his RA and not breathing. His AS was
previously characterized as mild but was found to be severe with
a valve area of 0.8 to 1.0 cm2.
.
On the floor patient comfortable denying any chest pain,
shortness of breath, fever, chills, night sweats, diarrhea,
constipation or vomiting. Does not chronic arthralgias due to
RA.

IMAGING:

[**12-29**] TTE:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

[**1-2**] CXR:
Lungs are clear. Heart size is normal, although the
configuration suggests
right atrial enlargement. Lungs are clear and there is no
pleural effusion.

[**1-2**] Left shoulder xray:
IMPRESSION: Degenerative changes in the AC and glenohumeral
joints but no
evidence of dislocation or fracture.

[**1-3**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
2. Distal pancreatic ductal dilitation concerning for stricture.
Recommend
ERCP for further evaluation.
3. Colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
4. Ectasia of the infrarenal abdominal aorta.
5. Near complete loss of L1 vertebral body height, new since
[**2162**] with
associated disc extrusion. No evidence of discitis.
6. Bilateral renal cysts.

[**1-4**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
very subtle
newly appeared parenchymal opacity at the right lung base.
Simultaneously,
there is persistent peribronchial thickening at the left lung
base. Overall, the changes could reflect chronic aspiration or
early pneumonia

[**1-7**] ECHO:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVE
