Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.
The patient went from the PACU to the ICU for post-op monitoring
given his multiple comorbidities.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. ICU course for immediate post-operative management of airway.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
incontinent thereafter. The surgical dressing was changed on
POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean and intact
without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen
daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the
hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. The patient's
weight-bearing status is weight bearing as tolerated on the
operative extremity.

Mr. [**Known lastname 105647**] is discharged to rehab in stable condition.
