History of Present Illness:
59F with multiple medical problems including ESRD s/p failed
renal transplant on PD currently, severe AS/moderate MS, GI
sarcoma s/p surgery/radiotherapy in [**2111**], HTN, and CAD s/p
NSTEMI. Who was admitted from the vascular clinic with a new
open area on her right foot noted to be draining "dark fluid"
with increased confusion since [**2126-6-22**]. She was a patient at the
[**Hospital 5503**] Rehab Hospital. Patient had been complaining of
right foot/right great toe pain since [**2125-5-25**] and was
previously seen by vascular surgery in [**2126-3-26**] with decreased
pulses on the right foot. At that time arterial duplex noted
patent bilateral femoropopliteal vessels, SFA stenosis on the
left, greater than 50%, poor visualization of the tibial
arteries bilaterally and likely bilateral iliac disease. Her
vessels were noted to be heavily calcified bilaterally. She was
recommended to undergo CTA at that time but refused. Since that
time she has had continued pain in her right foot, with severe
pain even at rest, but does not know if she has ever had
claudication or prior
ulcers. She reported that she has seen another vascular surgeon
at [**University/College **] this month but he stated that her vessels were "too
calcified to do anything." She denied any fever or chills but
had some nausea and had one episode
of emesis today.

Pertinent Results:
[**2126-7-12**] Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
Prebypass:

The left atrium is normal in size. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Trabeculations noted
in Left atrial appendage. A small, likely insignificant, patent
foramen ovale is present. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed,
anterior leaflet is heavily calcified and restricted, the
posterior leaflet has partial flail. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen with diastolic mitral regurgitation from aortic
regurgitation. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results on [**2126-7-12**] at 1000am.

Postbypass:
There is a well seated prosthetic valve in the aortic position.
No perivalvular leak is detected. A ring is visualized in the
tricuspid position with a decreased degree of tricuspid
regurgitation. No evidence of aortic dissection. Left
ventricular function is preserved from prebypass levels.

PCXR [**7-29**]:
Comparison is made with prior study, [**7-26**].
Moderate right pleural effusion with air-fluid level suggests
the presence of hydropneumothorax though the pleural line of the
pneumothorax is not as
conspicuous as before.  Large left pleural effusion with
adjacent atelectasis is unchanged.  Pulmonary edema has
improved, now mild.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and
widened mediastinum are stable.  Sternal wires are aligned.
Feeding tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
