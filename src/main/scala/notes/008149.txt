Chief Complaint:
VT storm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular tachycardia ablation


History of Present Illness:
85 year old man with chronic AF on coumadin, hypertension,
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 30%, s/p BiV ICD, hx of VT
with recent admission to CCH [**2165-7-28**] with VT storm s/p amio load
presented to OSH on [**2165-8-12**] after his telemed monitor noted a HR
of 130. At the OSH he converted spontaneously to a paced rhythm.
He was continued on Amio as he had intermittent bursts of VT -
always asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable while in VT. Seen
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19911**] on that admission and ICD was reprogrammed with
antitachycardia pacing at 115-150bpm without shock, 150-200 low
dose shock, and thereafter high dose shock. He had an episode of
acute systolic heart failure treated successfully with diuresis
on this admission as well. He was then discharged home. Over the
weekend he remained asymptomatic and then on [**2165-8-20**] he felt
light-headed and felt his ICD fire X 2. He called EMS who
recorded initially Vtach with a pulse although intermittently
was paced as well. He denied chest pain, palpitations, syncope,
SOB. He received valium for anxiety and was transferred to CCH.
In the ER at CCH, he was having runs of NSVT from 15-20 beats
per minute. He was seen by cardiology who recommended transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**] for VT ablation.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old man with history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with
EF 30% and recurrent VT despite Amiodarone treatment in past
admitted post-VT ablation to CMI service now transferred to CCU
with sustained VT and hypotension.
.
# RHYTHM: Patient with VT s/p ablation procedure, who
experienced VT of different morphology post-ablation. Per EP,
the patient's original VT was likely ablated, unmasking another
focus of VT.  Prior to transfer to CCU patient was in sustained
VT not responsive to anti-tachycardia pacing from his ICD X 6
trials. In the CCU, he was successfully V-paced and initially
treated with amiodarone.  Quinidine gluconate was added with
good rhythm control, and serial ECGs showed no signifant
prolongation of QTc.  In addition, his coreg was switched to
metoprolol and he was continued on his home dose of coumadin
with close monitoring of INRs.
.
# HYPOTENSION: Initially felt to be medication induced as the
patient had received multiple blood pressure medications along
with lasix prior to CCU transfer.  Hypotension initially
persisted after the patient was converted to a paced rhythm.  BP
medications and lasix were intially held, and the hypotension
resolved.  The patient remained asymptomatic throughout with no
orthostasis, dizziness, or chest pain.
.
# CORONARIES: The patient has no known history of CAD. Troponins
were negative X 1 at OSH ED.  He was continued on home dose of
enalapril, and coreg changed to metoprolol as above.
.
# PUMP: The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
and systolic heart failure with TTE showing an LVEF of 30%.  He
was continued on home dose of enalapril and lasix, coreg changed
to metoprolol as above.
.
#. Chronic Renal insufficiency: Cr 1.9-2.1, which is his
baseline per OSH records. All medications were renally dosed and
his creatinine was monitored daily while inpatient.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on home dose synthroid.
.
# Gout: Continued on home dose allopurinol.
.
# FEN/GI: Low sodium / Heart healthy, Diabetic/Consistent
Carbohydrate Diet.  Bowel regimen with senna and colace.
.
# CODE: Full Code.
