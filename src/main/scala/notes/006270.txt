Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68 y/o F with h/o diverticulosis presents with rectal
bleeding x 4 days. She has been having about 6 BM daily since 3
days prior to admission, which she describes as dark purple,
stringly, with clots. She has had about [**4-9**] bowel movements
daily but no abdominal pain. She denies lightheadedness, but has
baseline SOB that she ascribes to her COPD. She called her PCP
who directed her to the hospital.
.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2156-11-5**]. GI was consulted and
performed a colonoscopy which showed severe diverticulosis in
the sigmoid and descending [**Date Range 499**]. There were blood clots seen in
the distal sigmoid with no proximal blood. External compression
of the cecum was noted. The bleeding diverticula could not be
localized.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of diverticular
bleed with potential surgical or angio intervention.

Pertinent Results:

.
GI BLEEDING STUDY ([**2156-11-6**]): No evidence of active GI bleeding
at the time of study. Imaging was limited to 60 minutes at the
patients request.
.
GI BLEEDING STUDY ([**2156-11-8**]): No active gastrointestinal
bleeding at the time of study.
.
Colonoscopy ([**2156-11-9**]): Blood was seen in the [**Year (4 digits) 499**] at 18-25 cm
in distal sigmoid. There was no blood found elsewhere. Bleed
likely from diverticulm in this area.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN & PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST ([**2156-11-7**]):
No evidence of an extrinsic mass compressing the cecum. However
the right lobe of the liver extends inferiorly and contact the
superior aspect of the ascending [**Month/Day/Year 499**]. This might account for
the findings on colonoscopy. Correlation recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) GI bleed - Pt was initially admitted to the MICU on transfer
from OSH. Based on the results of her colonoscopy at the OSH,
the source of her bleed was thought to be diverticular from the
sigmoid [**Month/Day/Year 499**]. She was followed by the gastroenterology and
surgical services. She had a tagged RBC scan which was not able
to localize the source of bleeding further. Her hematocrit was
monitored Q4h and she remained hemodynamically stable with a
stable Hct. She was transferred to the floor on HD #3. On the
floor, she again had BRBPR. She remained hemodynamically stable,
but did require transfusion of 1U pRBCs to maintain her Hct. She
was sent for repeat bleeding scan which again was negative. She
continued to have BRBPR and had a repeat colonoscopy. This
colonoscopy was able to localize the bleed to the distal
sigmoid, but the specific site could not be identified and no
intervention was performed. She subsequently remained without
BRBPR and was discharged home on HD #5 with detailed
instructions to return if she has any further BRBPR.
.
2) Cecal compression - Her colonoscopy at the OSH showed
external compression of the cecum. An abdominal CT was performed
at [**Hospital1 18**] which did not show any evidence of an abdominal mass
causing external compression.
.
3) Hypertension - Pt's home regimen included lisinopril. This
was converted to shorter acting captopril during hospitalization
to avoid exacerbating hypotension in the event of a
hemodynamically significant bleed. Her blood pressure remained
under good control.
