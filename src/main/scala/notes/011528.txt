altered mental status
RLE pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
68-year-old female with h/o DM2, HTN, CAD, CHF and PVD s/p left
AKA, angioplasty to R tibial artery in [**3-19**], chronic venous
stasis ulcers s/p debridement one week PTA, also with death of
son 10d PTA, who presents with several days of RLE pain and
confusion. Patient unable to give history, spoke with her
grandson at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60469**] to gain some sense of story, though per
his report his aunt will be calling in to provide more detail.
From the grandson, the patient has had increasing RLE pain times
several days, and from the limited info provided by the patient
she ran out of the 60 tabs of Percocet also several days ago. It
is unclear if the patient has been taking more of her MS Contin
in the absence of Percocet. Per the grandson, the pt has been
"in and out of reality" for these past few days, unable to sleep
at night, poorly interactive during the day. The VNA saw the
patient on the DOA and felt that she was somnolent, called 911.

In the ED, the patient was confused and somnolent but in obvious
pain, wailing out but unable to give a history. She repeated
"cut it off" while holding her RLE. She received 2mg MSIR IV,
then 2 Percocets. On the floor she was still in pain, received
1mg IV dilaudid.

Reports:
[**2163-4-21**]   AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Unchanged
cardiomegaly. The hilar and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
There are increased pulmonary [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] markings. The patient is
rotated but there is probable small linear atelectasis at the
left lung base. No effusions are seen. Soft tissue and osseous
structures remain unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiac failure.

[**2163-4-21**]   CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial
hemorrhage. There are cluster of small (less than 1 cm)
hypodense areas near the atrium of the left lateral ventricle.
While nonspecific in etiology, the findings are most commonly
secondary to chronic small vessel infarction. Probable
additional chronic small vessel infarction is seen in the right
corona radiata. There is no sign for hydrocephalus or shift of
normally midline structures. It is to be noted that a number of
the sections are degraded by patient motion. The surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures show no overt pathology.
CONCLUSION: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage. Probable
multiple small chronic infarcts, as noted above.

EGD
Findings:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
Contents: Clotted blood was seen in the fundus.
Protruding Lesions: Three polypoid structures ranging in size
from 5mm to 7mm were found in the stomach body. One of them had
stigmata had recent bleeding. Three 1 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**]
injections were applied for hemostasis at the base of the polyp
with stigmata of recent bleeding. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was
applied for hemostasis successfully.
Excavated Lesions A single superficial non-bleeding 5mm ulcer
was found in the stomach body.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.


Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 68 yo w/ MMP now with recent GIB from likely
polypoid lesions s/p MICU stay, and severe PVD likely needing
[**Hospital1 1106**] surgery intervention.

Upper GI bleed
The patient has a history of GI bleeding and had a normal EGD in
the past several months per report.  She was on aspirin and
plavix for her common iliac stent.  During her hospitalization,
she had an episode of large volume hematemesis, requiring PRBC
support (x6 units) and a MICU transfer.  There she underwent two
EGDs which demonstrated normal esophagus and normal duodenum,
but showed three polypoid lesions in the stomach, one of which
had stigmata of bleeding; she underwent epinephrine injection
and cauterization to this area.  She also had a 5mm non bleeding
gastric ulcer.  She was started on a [**Hospital1 **] ppi.  Her HCT was
stable after this, and she had no further episodes of
hematemesis.  GI recommended a repeat EGD in [**3-20**] months, and a
colonoscopy for age appropriate screening.  These things were
conveyed in the discharge information to the patient and her
primary provider.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] aspirin and plavix were not reinitiated
on discharge and she will follow up with her [**Name10 (NameIs) 1106**] surgeon as
below.  Given that she will likely have a surgical procedure
within the next two weeks, consideration of restarting her
plavix alone after surgery was recommended.

Chronic Pain
The patient presented with difficult to control lower extremity
pain and a change in mental status on admission.  A head CT was
negative.  Acute and chronic pain service consults were
obtained, and her mental status cleared on modification of her
pain regimen.  A regimen of a fentanyl patch (25mcg q3 days),
MSSR (60 [**Hospital1 **]), amitryptiline (10 qhs), gabapentin (900 tid), and
4-8mg oral dilaudid q6h prn for breakthrough was finally arrived
at.  She will follow up with her primary care physician
regarding pain management.

Peripheral [**Hospital1 1106**] disease and ulcerations
The patient was on [**Hospital1 **] and plavix after a common iliac stent and
angioplasty on right tibial artery.  These two medications were
held given the GI bleed, and the patient was instructed to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60470**] regarding when to reinitiate
these medications.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60470**] is planning for a STSG of
her RLE ulcerations in two to three weeks after discharge.  She
was briefly on vancomycin given her history of MRSA colonization
of her RLE lesions, but this was discontinued p
