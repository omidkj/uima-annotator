Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous transvenous clot extraction from pulmonary artery.
Removal of internal cardioverter difibrillator.
Removal of PICC line with placement of Swan-Ganz catheter to
prevent further pulmonary embolism.
New PICC line placement because nafcillin cannot be used by
midline.

History of Present Illness:
  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60-year-old man with dilated non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (clean cath.; LVEF 15%), with ICD placement and
removal after complication by MSSA endocarditis, undergoing
antibiotic therapy at rehabilitation, presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] after
a syncopal episode.

  Mr. [**Known lastname **] has been at [**Hospital3 **] for about one week,
where he has been receiving oxacillin for his endocarditis. Just
after lunch today, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was watching television with
family when his 'eyes rolled back in his head' and he lost
consciousness. Staff described him as [**Doctor Last Name 352**] with agonal breathing
and pinpoint pupils. He was placed on a non-rebreather. Blood
sugar was 111. Tele strips at the time demonstrate AFib with HR
about 38. Documentation of the event varies. [**Name6 (MD) **] the MD note, he
regained consciousness and was coherent within 60 seconds. Per
the nursing staff, he gained awareness within 10 minutes but
could not recall what had happened. BP immediately after event
was 80/40 with pulse 70-90. He was given 500cc NS bolus and a
dose of 2g IV cefepime.

  Upon arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 98.0 101/67 100 18
100% NRB. He was given flagyl 500mg IV and zosyn 4.5g IV. He
became hypotensive to 88/61 and received 1L of IVF and was
started on a levophed gtt. A left groin CVL was placed. Work-up
revealed a right central PE with concern for wedge infarct.
Given that his INR was elevated at 5, he was not considered a
candidate for thrombolysis. He was therefore transferred to the
cath lab for possible thrombectomy.

  In the cath lab, a right heart cath showed pulmonary HTN and
pulmonary angiogram was done, demonstrating embolic occlusion of
subsegmental branch in the right middle lobe. A thrombectomy was
performed with restoration of blood flow. The team then placed a
retrievable IVC filter (although there was no visible clot in
the right iliac vein).

  Upon arrival to the CCU, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] chest pain,
shortness of breath, or cough. Apart from being quite sweaty, he
feels like his normal self.

CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular
line. Irregularly irregular. Soft systolic murmur at LLSB. No
thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. CTAB, no crackles,
wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Obese. Wound dressing at prior drain site in LLQ. Bowel
sounds present. Soft and not tender. No mass appreciated.
EXTREMITIES: +pitting LE edema b/l.
PULSES:
Right: DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: DP 2+ PT 2+

On the day of discharge, vital signs were: 97.6 (max. 97.9) F,
108/78 (91/74 - 116/81) mmHg, 100 (artifactually low [**Location (un) 1131**] of
41 in context of ectopy - 100) BPM, RR of 22 (minimum 20) and 94
% hemoglobin saturation on room air. Telemetry revealed two runs
of ventricular tachycardia of 30 beats, both near 5 p.m. last
night.

Physical exam findings were essentially unchanged, but for
transmitted upper airway sounds of loose mucus. No consolidation
or other signs of infection.

REPORTS:
CTA CHEST [**2124-3-29**]:
1. Large pulmonary embolism involving distal right main
pulmonary artery
extending into all lobes of the right lung. Occlusion is
complete in the
right upper lobe posterior segment, and partially elsewhere.
Wedge posterior
right upper lobe parenchymal abnormality suggestive of pulmonary
infarct. No
CT evidence of right ventricular heart strain.
2. No acute aortic pathology.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.
4. Left upper lobe consolidation. Other pulmonary nodular
opacities as
above, measure up to 7 mm. Findings could be infectious, but
recommend
short-term followup in three-to-six months after appropriate
treatment to
assess for stability/resolution and exclude neoplastic process.
5. Possible trace perisplenic fluid, not well or fully assessed.


CARDIAC CATH [**2124-3-29**]:
1. Access was obtained at the left femoral vein using an 8 Fr
short
sheath.
2. Right pulmonary angiography was performed through a 5 Fr JR4
catheter.  This showed an occlusive embolus in a right
subsegmental
branch.  We exchanged the catheter to a 6 Fr MPA1 guide catheter
and
attempted to aspirate material.  Aspirate was sent for
microbiologic
culture.  Partial restoration of flow occurred.  We next
advanced a
Prowater wire across the embolus and activated an Export AP
aspiration
thrombectomy catheter over several passes.  Flow to the
pulmonary
segment improved substantially and the residual embolic material
was
left.
3. Venography performed via the left femoral vein sheath showed
no
apparent thrombus in the left iliac vein, proximal right iliac
vein, or
IVC.
4. An Optease Vena Cava filter was deployed in the IVC below the
renal
veins.
