Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain, weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
subclavian central line
peripherally inserted central catheter

History of Present Illness:
81F with h/o lumbar stenosis, DJD, chornic back pain on epidural
injections, cervical spondylosis, parkinsonism, B12 neuropathy,
and AF on flecainide, who presents with worsening back pain, RLE
weakness and fever. She reports that she had been in USOH until
[**2-11**], when she woke up with increasingly severe LBP, worse with
movement, and she found it difficult to ambulate. In the ER,
exam showed R leg weakness. She was also found to be febrile to
102. L-spine MRI demonstrated increased T2 signal in L4-5
without enhancement, c/w DJD or discitis. Repeat MRI with STIR
images again showed no enhancement, suggesting DJD.
.
She was admitted, and found to have high grade bacteremia in [**7-18**]
bottles, which grew MSSA. She was started on vancomycin/CTX, and
switched to nafcillin once speciation and sensitivies were
complete. Gentamicin was held due to renal insufficiency. Having
had a recent toe surgery, she underwent a foot xray, which
showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. Pelvis film showed no
evidence of SI joint infection. Given high-grade bacteremia, TTE
was performed which showed no evidence of vegetation, but TEE
revealed a sub-cm aortic valve vegetation wihtout evidence of
peri-valvular abscess. She has had negative blood cultures since
[**2-12**] on nafcillin.
.
Due to worsening pain, she had a C-spine and T-spine MRI, which
demonstrated a fluid collection posterior to L2-3, extending
inferiorly beyond the T-spine cuts, which had not been noted
previously. Neurosurgery was consulted, who recommended a repeat
dedicated lumbar MRI. This was performed in the ICU after
elective intubation [**3-16**] patient agitation and showed new large
epidural abscess extending from the T11 to the L5 levels causing
severe canal stenosis. After a long discussion with the family,
it was decided to attempt conservative treatment with
antibiotics and re-image in 1 week given likely high
peri-operative mortality. Given her agitation and confusion, a
brain MR was done which showed enhancement of the sulci,
suggesting meningeal irritation or infection. Her mental status
appeared to remain stable and she was transferred to the floor
for further management.

Admission CXR: There is mild cardiomegaly.  There is
mild perihilar haziness, right greater than left, likely
indicating edema. There are scattered nodular opacities in both
lung fields, though these are not as prominent when compared to
the prior examination.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**2-26**]): Multilevel discitis extending from L1 through
L5-S1 levels with new areas of increased T2 signal along the
disc spaces of L1-L2 and L3-L4 levels.  There is however
decrease involving the overall size of the epidural abscess
detected on the previous examination which still extends from
T11-T12 through L5-S1 levels.  The largest loculation is seen at
the L4-L5 level resulting in significant narrowing of the canal.
 A paraspinal phlegmon is also identified at L4-L5 level.
Further followup is suggested.
.
SUPINE & UPRIGHT KUB ([**2-20**]):  The bowel gas pattern is
non-obstructive.  There is a normal amount of stool.  There is
no evidence of free intra-abdominal air. Visualized portions of
the lungs are grossly clear.  There are severe degenerative
changes of the lower lumbar spine.  There is a right common
iliac stent.  A rectal tube appears to be in place.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of obstruction or free air.
.
TEE ([**2-19**]):
The left atrium is top normal in size. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium and left atrial
appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There are simple (<4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the
aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. There aortic valve
leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. A 5x7mm, highly mobile
echodensity is seen on the aortic side of the left coronary
leaflet c/w a vegetation. No aortic valve abscess is seen. There
is trivial aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened with minimally increased gradient/stenosis.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: Small to moderate sized mobile echodensity on the
aortic side of the aortic valve consistent with a vegetation
(though atypical in location). Minimal mitral stenosis. Mild
mitral regurgitation.
.
Renal U/S ([**2-18**]):
FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 10.1 cm in length.  The
left kidney measures 10.3 cm in length.  There is no
hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. Both kidneys are echogenic,
suggestive of renal parenchymal disease.  Within the mid pole of
the right kidney again seen is a 1.3-cm simple cyst.  The
previously seen left upper lobe cyst is not well demonstrated on
the today's study secondary to technique and patient's body
habitus.  No renal masses or perirenal fluid collections are
seen.  The resisti
