Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1646**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, knee pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L knee washout
intubation
extubation
transesophageal echocardiogram

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 25 yo F with PMH of severe persistent asthma
with multiple prior intubations, IVDA, septic arthritis
presenting with two days of fever and knee pain.  She reports
that on the evening  prior to presentation she developed fever
to 102 and swelling of her left knee.  Two days prior to that
she reports falling out of a car and cutting her hand on the
ground which became progressively more swollen and painful.  She
does also endorse injecting heroin into her right antecubital
fossa one week ago but denies sharing needles.  Of note, details
of her history change when asked at different times or by
different interviewers.

She also endorses history of cellulitis in her left leg two
months ago at [**Hospital **] hospital for which she was treated with
antibiotics.  [**Doctor Last Name **] reports that the infection started in her
foot and spread upward.  She denies having to have her left knee
tapped at that time.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 101 P 146 BP 105/64 R 18 O2 sat
94% RA.  She had drainage of a 2x2 cm abscess on her left hand
which was packed in the ED.  She was evaluated by orthopedics
due to concern for septic joint and she had drainage of
reportedly purulent material from her left knee.  She was given
6L NS IV and had 3L urine output in ED.  She was also given
morphine 4mg IV, zosyn 4mg IV, tylenol 1 g po, levofloxacin
750mg IV, ativan 0.5mg IV, vancomycin 1g IV.


Past Medical History:
Severe persistent asthma - multiple intubations
chronic sinusitis
opiod dependence
s/p bilateral knee replacements for osteonecrosis [**2-26**] long term
prednisione use (R knee [**9-1**], left knee [**1-1**])
hypogammaglobulinemia
hepatitis c
tobacco abuse
-spontaneous PTX in [**5-2**]
-s/p R VATS/bleb resection and pleurectomy at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital
in [**2141-6-25**]
osteopenia by xray

Social History:
She endorses recent injection of heroin in the past week and
reports that prior to this she had been clean for about two
years.  She does have history of injection drug use and cocaine
use in the past.
Tobacco: She endorses smoking [**1-26**] PPD currently and has been
smoking for the past 10 years.

Family History:
Mother - breast cancer
[**Name (NI) **] - asthma and hyperthyroidism

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 98.1 BP: 92/64 P:95 R:21 O2: 97% RA
General:  awake, alert and oriented
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, oropharynx clear,
no roths spots
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: decreased air movement, scattered squeaks in the upper
air fields, no crackles
CV: regular, tachycardic(after nebs), normal S1 + S2, no
murmurs, rubs, gallops
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: left knee with clean dry surgical site with staples in
place. +edema, but not erythema. Mild tenderness to palpation.
Good ROM. Good pulses.

Pertinent Results:
[**2142-10-2**] knee X ray: In comparison with the study of [**8-29**],
there has been placement of a total knee prosthesis without
evidence of hardware-related complication.  There is substantial
soft tissue swelling in the suprapatellar region. It is unclear
whether this could merely represent postoperative change, since
the date of the surgical procedure is not known. If
postoperative changes should have been resolved by this time,
the possibility of an acute inflammatory process must be
seriously considered given the clinical history.

[**2142-10-2**] chest x ray pa / lat: No acute intrathoracic process.

[**2142-10-2**] hand x ray: Osteopenia, for which additional workup is
strongly recommended (perhaps beginning with bone mineral
measurements). If this patient has no underlying obvious
etiology, the differential would include osteogenesis
imperfecta.

[**2142-10-3**] transthoracic echocardiogram: Suboptimal study due to
patient decision not to allow for study completion. Possible
very small vegetation on the posterior mitral leaflet.  If
clinically indicated, a follow-up transthoracic study with color
Doppler and apical images and/or a TEE is suggested to better
assess the possible posterior mitral leaflet abnormality

[**2142-10-3**] transthoracic echocardiogram:  The left atrium and right
atrium are normal in cavity size. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-10-3**], the
previously noted mobile echodensity on the posterior mitral
leaflet is no longer seen . Mild mitral regurgitation is now
seen (not previously assessed).If the clinical suspicion for
endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE would be better able to
define the mitral valve morphology and severity of mitral
regurgitation.

[**2142-10-4**] transesophageal echocardiogram: The left atrium and
right atrium are normal in cavity size. The interatrial septum
is aneurysmal. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-10-3**], the
previously noted mobile echodensity on the posterior mitral
leaflet is no longer seen . Mild mitral regurgitation is now
seen (not previously assessed).  If the clinical suspicion for
endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE would be better able to
define the mitral valve morphology and severity of mitral
regurgitation.
