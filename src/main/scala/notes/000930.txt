Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77 year old female with COPD, ESRD on HD, CAD, MVR,
who was tranferred from an outside hospital ED already intubated
for respiratory failure. Also with hyperkalemia. She was
afebrile ane hemodynamically stable.

According to family, the patient had progressive SOB
yesterday,despite increasing chronic home O2 from 2L to 4+L. No
cough/fever/chills/CP. Of note, she has a h/o intubations for
COPD flares. She was also due for HD.

Patient was treated for recent bronchitis 4 weeks ago with
Z-Pack. She reports being well until [**Month (only) **] of last year when
she was first hospitalized for COPD exacerbation and was
intubated. Since then she has been intubated 3 times. She
reports that she has been on dialysis since [**11-29**].

Patient was admitted from the ED to the MICU. She received
kayexalate, insulin, D5 and calcium carbonate for high
potassium. She was kept on solumedrol for 24 hours. She was
started on Levofloxacin. She was extubated on [**6-13**].

Past Medical History:
1. COPD on chronic O2 (most recent intubation x 1yr ago)
2. ESRD on HD (T, TH, Sat) thought to be secondary to XRT for
uterine ca
3. Uterine ca x 16 yrs ago s/p chemo/xrt
4. CAD s/p CABG x 3 [**10-30**]
5. MVR on coumadin (PCP believes this is porcine and goal INR is
1.5-2.5; no valve seen on CXR)
6. s/p cholecystectomy
7. anxiety
8. GERD
9. restless legs.

Social History:
Lives with supportive husband. [**Name (NI) **] 5 children. Ambulatory. Uses
2L oxygen at home when active. Quit smoking one year ago. Prior
to that smoked 1 pack every two days. Does not drink alcohol.

Blood culture negative.
Sputum gram stain: 3+ gram positive cocci in
pairs/chains/cluters
                   2+ gram negatvie rods
Sputum culture: moderate orophayngeal flora with sparse
pseudomonas

Pertinent Results:
ECG: Normal sinus rhythm. First degree AV block. Probable
anterior infarct - age undetermined. Lateral ST-T changes offer
additional evidence of ischemia. Repolarization changes may be
partly due to rate. Clinical correlation is suggested
No previous tracing. Rate: 120. Intervals: PR 0 QRS 72 QT/QTc
330/401.42 Axis: P 0 QRS 0 T 113

CXR: The heart is enlarged. There are increased interstitial
markings and perihilar haziness, consistent with congestive
heart failure. Small left pleural effusion is also likely
present. The patient is post median sternotomy and mitral valve
replacement. An endotracheal tube terminates just proximal to
the carina. An NG tube is seen coarsing below the diaphragm into
the proximal stomach.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with congestive heart failure. Low
lying endotracheal
tube which could be pulled back several centiimeters.

CXR: The heart shows slight left ventricular enlargement.
There is evidence of a prosthetic valve and prior CABG surgery.
The pulmonary
vessels are slightly prominent and appear slightly blurred.
Slight left heart
failure may be present. There is also evidence of patchy
atelectasis at the
left lung base behind the heart and some minor atelectasis is
also noted in
the right lower lobe. Interstitial changes are present in both
lungs, mainly
in the mid and upper zones. The endotracheal tube, the right IJ
central line,
and the NG line are in good position.

IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with slightly improving left
heart
failure. Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. Background CABG and
prosthetic valve
surgery.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
77 year old woman with ESRD, COPD, CAD, MVR admitted with COPD
exacerbation/CHF, initially intubated. Now extubated, afebrile
and hemodynamically stable.

1. Respiratory failure: Likely COPD flare with possible
component of CHF. Patient was extubated with no event after 48
hours and maintained on 4L O2. She was given solumedrol for 24
hours and then transitioned to prednisone taper, serevent,
flovent, albuterol and atrovent. She was started on levofloxacin
for COPD flare as she had bronchitis recently and was treated
with azithromycin and did not improve. Sputum culture was
obtained and showed sparse growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa
thought to be a colonizer. As the patient was not febrile and
not producing much sputum she was not started on antibiotics.
After hemodialysis with fluid removal patient was euvolemic. She
was continued on ACE I for afterload reduction.

2. ESRD:  Patient received dialysis Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday
and Monday. To have next session Thursday at [**Location (un) 4265**] [**Location (un) 3786**]. She
was dialyzed to her 59 kg on day of discharge. On Tuesday 1.9 kg
was removed, on Thursday 2.8 kg was removed, on Saturday 3.3 kg
was removed adn on Monday 2.9 kg was removed.

3. MVR: Patient was maintained on coumadin.

4. CAD: Patient was contined on lipitor, beta blocker and Ace
inhibitor.

5. Hyperkalemia: Resolved with insulin, D5, kayexalate. Now on
dialysis.

6. FEN: Heart friendly diet, 2 gm sodium, 1 liter fluid
restriciton. No elevation of blood glucose while on prednisone.

7. Lines: Right internal jugular central line placed in
intensive unit and removed on the floor.

8. family:  Husband is health care proxy.
10. code status: full code.
