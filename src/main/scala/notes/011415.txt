Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Aortic Regurgitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic Valve Replacement

History of Present Illness:
32 year old male admitted directly from clinic found to have 4+
aortic regurgitation on exam and confirmed on echo. He has a
past medical history significant for an unknown heart valve
problem diagnosed as a child. He is from [**Country 3587**], non-english
speaking, moved here 2 months ago to get married to his wife who
translated this interview.

He has experienced chest pain for many year and was told in [**Country **] that he had a problem with one of his heart valves though
never had a specific diagnosis. He never had an EKG nor required
treatment. These episodes of chest pain are described as
squeezing on the left side of hi chest that radiated to hid left
arm and shoulder. The pain is short-lived - only 3-5 minutes. He
states he doesnt exert himself for more than 10 minutes at a
time since he is fearful of bringing on these chest pain
episodes. However, these episodes of chest pain are not
temporally related to any exertion. He also reports palpitations
and diaphoresis during these times. These episodes resolve if he
turns off the light and breaths deeply.

Per online medical record note, when he was seen in clinic
today, he became tearful during the interview and experience
chest pain, diaphoresis and was ill-appearing. His blood
pressure at that time was 220/90, heart rate 100.
Electrocardiogram at that time showed lateral ST depression
which was different than the EKG taken 30 minute prior when he
was chest pain free.

On admission to the floor, the patient denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, N/V/D, change in vision or headache. He
becames tearful when discussing possible surgery. His wife was
present during the interview and translated.


Past Medical History:
Broken arm, with metal plate repair
Unknown heart valve problem
Possible ulcer

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Severely dilated LV cavity.
No LV mass/thrombus. Moderately depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No
masses or vegetations on aortic valve. No AS. Increased
transaortic velocity related to increased stroke volume due to
AR. Severe (4+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No
mass or vegetation on mitral valve. No MS. Mild to moderate
([**11-26**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) with global hypokiinesis and regioanl
akinesis of the basal inferior wall. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The RV has mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened and do not coapt
well. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to increased stroke
volume due to aortic regurgitation. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen (holodiastolic flow reversal in the
descending thoracic aorta) . The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic regurgitation with severely dilated LV
and mild to moderate LV systolic dysfunction.
