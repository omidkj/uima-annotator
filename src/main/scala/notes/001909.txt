Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66100**] was admitted and remained on Oxacillin for his MSSA
bacteremia. Repeat blood cultures remained negative. Warfarin
continued to be held. As his INR dropped below 2.0, intravenous
Heparin was initiated. He otherwise remained stable on medical
therapy. A transesophogeal echocardiogram on [**3-3**] was
notable for a large secundum atrial septal defect and
approximately a 7 millimeter vegetation on the right ventricular
lead. There was continuous flow across the atrial septal defect.
The ASD was a new finding, as it was not documented on outside
echocardiogram. Due to the ASD, blind extraction of the RV lead
and port-a-cath was not recommended as there was substantial
risk for paradoxical embolism. Cardiac surgery was there for
consulted for surgical intervention. Prior to surgical
intervention, cardiac catheterization was performed. Coronary
angiography showed native three vessel disease, with a patent
LIMA to LAD. No patent vein grafts were visualized and left
ventriculography was deferred. Preoperative carotid noninvasive
studies revealed no stenosis in the right internal carotid
artery with an insignificant stenosis of less than 40% in the
left internal carotid artery. On [**3-6**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
performed a surgical repair of his atrial septal defect and ICD
lead extraction under cardiopulmonary bypass while Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] performed concomitant removal of his port-a-cath.
Operative cultures were obtained. The operation was otherwise
uneventful and he was brought to the CSRU for monitoring. Within
24 hours, he was extubated. He remained at his neurologic
baseline. Due to incisional discomfort, he was started on a
Dilaudid PCA. He remained in a junctional rhythm with rate 50-70
but otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics. He transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day two. Oxacillin was continued and
Warfarin anticoagulation was resumed. Low dose beta blockade was
resumed for periods of atrial fibrillation which he tolerated
well. On [**3-10**], a left basilic vein PICC line was placed
without complication for long term antibiotics. Over several
days, he was noted to have periods of bradycardia and conversion
pauses, with periods of atrial tachycardia/fibrillation on
telemetry. He was concomitantly noted to have a decline in renal
function. His creatinine peaked to 2.5. The ACE inhibitor was
therefore discontinued. Due to the potential for temporary
pacing wire secondary to bradycardia, Warfarin was temporarily
stopped and Heparin was utilized for anticoagulation. With close
consultation with the EP service, all nodal agents were titrated
accordingly. Over several days of adjusted medical therapy, his
heart rate and rhythm improved. Warfarin was eventually resumed
as was beta blockade for rate control. He continued to
experience bouts of atrial fibrillation. Due to suboptimal
control of his diabetes mellitus, the [**Last Name (un) **] Center was
consulted to assist in the management of his blood sugars. The
remainder of his hospital course was unremarkable. His renal
function gradually improved. Due to explantation of his ICD
system, he was fitted for the LifeVest external defibrillator
system prior to discharge. He will continue to require
intravenous antibiotics for an additional four weeks and then
return for an AICD in six weeks.
