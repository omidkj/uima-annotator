Chief Complaint:
Non-specific malaise

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2145-5-19**] Mitral valve repair


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75060**] is a very nice 36-year-old man with known mitral
valve prolapse for approximately the last four years. He was
always told he had a heart murmur since childhood but was not
diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse until [**2141**] when he was
worked-up for dizziness. More recently he developed a febrile
illness following in [**2145-1-23**] which consisted of a few weeks
of fever, sweats and cough. He had significantly exerted himself
for several hours shoveling snow and came ill a day or two
later. He was ultimately diagnosed with pneumonia and placed on
antibiotics. Around the same time, he had obtained a new primary
care physician and given his history of mitral valve prolapse,
an echocardiogram had been electively scheduled for further
follow-up. This revealed a newly-flail posterior mitral leaflet
with severe regurgitation, a dilated left ventricle and
pulmonary hypertension. As this was found in conjunction with
his febrile illness and he had his teeth cleaned several weeks
prior, there was a concern for endocarditis however work-up was
negative. Currently he admits to fatigue and overall not feeling
well the last few months. He does not have any chest discomfort,
palpitations, orthopnea or exertional dyspnea. Due to
echocardiographic evidence of early LV decompensation with
dilation, he has been referred for cardiac surgery and was first
evaluated [**4-2**].

Pertinent Results:
[**5-19**] Echo: Prebypass: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened with more severe thickening of the posterior leaflet
with flail of the P2 and P3 scallops. An eccentric, anteriorly
directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to
the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no
pericardial effusion.
Postbypass: The patient is in sinus rhythm and on an infusion of
norepinephrine. There is an annuloplasty ring in the mitral
position which appears well-seated. Mitral regurgitation is now
trace. Mean gradient is 3 mmHg at a CO of 6.4 L/min.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. Other valvular
findings are unchanged. The thoracic aorta is intact post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75060**] was a same day admission and was brought directly to
the operating room where he underwent a mitral valve repair.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Later that day he was weaned from pressors.
He awoke neurologically intact and extubated.  His chest tubes
were removed and he was transferred to the surgical step down
floor. he developed post operative afib on POD#3 which lasted
approx 12 hrs and converted to SR w/ IV amiodarone. Couamdin was
not started. His platelet count was low (77) but he has a
history of thrombocytopenia. HIT was negative. He was started on
betablockade and diuresed toward his pre-operative weight. He
was evaluated by physical therpay for strength and conditioning
and was discharged to home on POD#4. All instructions were
advised and appointments made.
