[**2110-1-20**]: Pt underwent Coronary angiography which revealed right
dominant system with 3 vessel disease.  The LMCA had 50% ostial
stenosis.  The LAD had diffuse severe calcification with a
complex, ulcerated tandem lesions in a tortuous mid vessel with
serial 60% stenoses before an 80% fical lesion in the distal
segment.  The Cx had a small AVG segment with a large OM1 with
mild luminal irregularities and an OM2 a 70% origin lesion.
The RCA was ostially occluded and collaterals filled the PL and
PDA from the LCA. Cardiac Echocardiogram showed left atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to
distal lateral/apical lateral hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2110-1-24**]: There is no appreciable left pleural effusion.
Small right
pleural effusion demonstrated to be mobile on [**1-23**] is
unchanged.
Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable
since [**1-19**], mild dilatation of the upper lobe pulmonary
vasculature is unchanged but there is no edema. Mild bibasilar
atelectasis is stable since [**1-23**]. No pneumothorax.
.
ECG [**2110-1-24**]: Sinus rhythm. Incomplete right bundle-branch block.
Possible left atrial abnormality. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2110-1-20**] heart rate is slower. Inferolateral ST-T wave
abnormalities persist.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2110-1-17**] - [**2110-1-19**]: 70 yoF was admitted s/p aortobifemoral byass
for 5.3cm infrarenal AAA complicated by post-op demand ischemia.
The pt tolerated the procedure well, however, she spent a
prolonged period of time in the PACU where she developed
respiratory acidosis after being extubated. Due to the
respiratory depression, posibly from narcotics, she was again
intubated, and her acidosis improved. Finally, the pt was
transferred from the PACU to the ICU after she self extubated.
Post-operatively she had EKG changes and elevated troponins. She
ruled in for NSTEMI and had a cardiac catheterization which
showed 3 vessel disease. She was then referred to cardiac
surgery for revascularization. The pt became hypotensive and was
repleted with fluids.
.
POD #3 [**2110-1-20**]:  Pt underwent Coronary angiography and Cardiac
Echocardiogram. The LAD was direct stented as well as the distal
OM2. Following the procedure, it was noted that the pt had some
pleural effusion to the Left lung as well as a hematoma to the
right neck.
.
POD #4(1) [**2110-1-21**]: Pt went in to rapid Afib with RVR. She was
put on an amiodarone drip. Her pain was controlled, and her
lytes were repleted. The pt remained stable.
.
POD #5 (2) [**2110-1-22**]: The aFib continued to be controlled with the
amiodarone drip, and she was switched to oral medications at
night. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 31469**] saw the pt, and recommends she goes
home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor with results being emailed to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He also recomends the amiodarone taper and
dabigatran [**Hospital1 **]. She was diuresed, as we attribute some of your
hypoxemia to be resulting from volume overload, in addition to
your baseline COPD. You were transferred from the ICU to the
VICU without incident.
.
POD #[**6-19**] ([**3-16**]) [**2110-1-23**]: Bedside speech & swallow came to see
you, and believe that you are able to eat without aspirating.
You continued to do well with amiodoraone oral medications, and
we continued to diurses you. As we removed some of your fluids,
your respirations continued to improve. PT saw the pt and walked
her with O2 without incident. The pt continued nebs q6hrs.
.
POD # 10(7) [**2110-1-27**]: You were able to walk without the
assistance of oxygen. We sent pt home with nebulizer treatments
& BP control meds. She is to have close follow-up with vascular
and cardiac doctors. Her heart rate remained stable, we put her
on the [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts machine and a tapering dose of amiodarone.
