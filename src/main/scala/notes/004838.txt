Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2113-9-5**] after sustaining an
unwitnessed fall with loss of consciousness. His injuries were:
C2 Hangman's fracture, bilateral comminuted displaced mandibular
fracture, tongue laceration, left 3rd and 6th rib fracture,
laceration over left tibia, w/ bone exposed, 2cm lac over left
knee. Received immediate care at [**Hospital **] Hospital where his
tongule laceration was repaired and he was intubated for airway
protection. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Neuro: Ortho spine was consulted regarding his C2 fracture and
recommended [**Location (un) 2848**] J [**Location (un) 8658**] for 6 weeks. The patient was sedated
while intubated, but after extubation, patient's pain was well
controlled with IV medications. After tolerating po intake,
patient was transitioned to po pain medications.

HEENT: The patient was taken to the operating [**Last Name (un) **] by OMFS on
HD4 for repair of his mandibular fractures. Please see operative
report for further details. Patient tolerated the procedure
well.

CVS: The patient has a history of CHF and A-fib. Troponins were
trended and remained stable at 0.02. He was continued on his
cardiac home medications. Patient required IV lopressor while in
the hospital due to episodes of rapid afib into the 140s. He was
transferred to the floor on [**9-14**], but was transferred back to
the ICU on [**9-15**] for rapid heart rate. The patient's po lopressor
dose was titrated up, and heartrate normalized. Patient remained
hemodynamically stable during all of these episodes with normal
blood pressures. Cardiology was consulted and recommend
titrating up metroprolol, and maintaining patient on amiodarone,
digoxin, and amlodopine. At time of discharge, the patient was
in normal sinus rhythm with normal rate.

Pulm: The patient was initially managed on mechanical
ventilation. A tracheostomy was performed on HD4 due to
excessive swelling in the face from the initial accident. He was
administered prednisone to complete a course previously started
at OSH. Tracheostomy was removed on [**2113-9-14**], and the patient
tolerated this well. His O2 sats were normal at room air at the
time of discharge.

GI/FEN: The patient was kept NPO with a OGT in place, once
extubated, patient's diet was advanced. He was kept on full
liquid diet per OMFS recommendations. He will stay on full
liquid diet for several weeks per OMFS.

GU: A foley catheter was placed for UOP monitoring. Fluids and
diuretics were administered judiciously based on fluid status.
Foley was removed [**2113-9-14**], and patient has been incontinent of
urine since.

Heme: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely;
no transfusions were required.

ID: The patient was administered Unasyn for his open mandibular
fracture, but this was discontinued several days prior to
discharge.

Endo: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his
stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; he received
famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis. He was started on a
heparin gtt on [**9-13**] for persistent afib, and patient was started
on coumadin. heparing gtt will continue until patient is
therapeutic, then he will be transitioned to coumadin only.
