Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Admitted from OSH after having seizure at home and found to have
left frontal lobe and cerebellar hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
78 y/o man with recent diagnosis of intracranial mass admitted
from OSH after having seizure at home and found to have left
frontal lobe and cerebellar hemorrhage. At OSH BS was 59.  CT
head showed ICH.  He was transferred to the ED here.  Pt
intubated in ER for airway protection.  At [**Hospital1 18**], he had MR head
revealing a large left frontal intraparenchymal lesion that is
predominantly hemorrhagic in nature. This lesion exhibits
irregular contrast enhancement. There is significant edema
associated with this lesion.  There is also a lesion seen
involving the cerebellum, also hemorrhagic in nature. This
lesion exhibits more solid type enhancement. These findings are
consistent with metastatic disease.  He had a CT chest which
revealed a dominant spiculated nodule in the medial aspect of
the left upper lobe highly suspicious for a neoplasm. Additional
scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules noted as well.  He was
admitted to the Neurosurg service in the SICU.

CT CHest: IMPRESSION:
1. Dominant spiculated nodule in the medial aspect of the left
upper lobe highly suspicious for a neoplasm. Additional
scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules as above.
2. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
3. Multiple hypoattenuating liver lesions, some of which likely
represent cysts. The rest, however, cannot be accurately
characterized on this study.
4. Cystic enhancing mass in the medial aspect of the spleen and
the stomach.
.
CT HEAD: IMPRESSION:
1. Large 3.9 x 2.7 cm left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage
with severe vasogenic edema. Resultant 7 mm rightward subfalcine
herniation and mass effect on the left lateral ventricular body.
Given marked vasogenic edema and second lesion in the
cerebellum, hemorrhage is likely secondary to underlying
neoplasm, probably metastatic.
2. 2.7 x 1.6 cm hyperdense lesion within the cerebellum, likely
representing hemorrhagic metastasis, causing mass effect on the
fourth ventricle, with no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: IMPRESSION:
1. There is a large left frontal intraparenchymal lesion that is
predominantly hemorrhagic in nature. This lesion exhibits
irregular contrast enhancement. There is significant edema
associated with this lesion. This is concerning for metastatic
disease as noted on prior report from the CT scan from [**2136-9-12**].
2. There is also a lesion seen involving the cerebellum, also
hemorrhagic in nature. This lesion exhibits more solid type
enhancement. These findings are consistent with metastatic
disease.
3. There are no other enhancing lesions identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 M hypoglycemic/sz. CT large multi IPH with edema, mild MLS,
no hydrocephalus. Neuro exam: right side weakness, esp RUE.
.
# Intracranial lesions:  Neurosurgery recommended an operation
for fluid evacuation and debulking given mass effect from the
tumors.  Decadron and Dilantin were started IV to decrease edema
in setting of tumors and to prevent seizures, respectively.  His
wife and grandaughter (HCP) both decided that he would not want
an operation.  On [**9-12**] he was extubated without event and
remained on Bipap until [**9-13**].  He remained stable on bipap
despite marked discomfort from the mask and on [**9-13**], he was
transferred to the MICU team for further management.  Upon
transfer, a family meeting was held during which the patient
confirmed his desire for comfort measures only and no operation
with hospice at home if possible.
.
# Respiratory distress:  Intubated initially for airway
protection and extubated without event on [**9-12**].  On [**9-13**], he
declined further bipap and the mask was removed.  At this time,
his breathing became labored and a morphine drip was begun at
his and his family's request.
.
# Dispo:  The MICU team consulted palliative care upon transfer
who recommended home with hospice and discussed plans for
transfer to home on [**9-14**].  However, upon discontinuing the Bipap
mask, the patient's respiratory distress worsened and he
required a morphine drip for comfort.  Per palliative care
recommendations, goals of care were switched for continuing
in-hospital care while on the morphine drip titrating to
comfort. The patient expired on the morning of [**2136-9-14**] with
family at the bedside.
