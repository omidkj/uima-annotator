Admission Date:  [**2124-12-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2124-12-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2078-6-17**]     Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46-year-old
woman with a history of deep venous thrombosis times two, not
on anticoagulation, who also has a significant family history
for coronary artery disease.
She was in her usual state of health until 10 p.m. on the
night prior to admission when she developed the acute onset
of infrascapular pressure at rest.  She went to bed but was
unable to fall asleep for several hours due to this
discomfort.  She finally fell asleep, but awoke at 7 a.m. on the
morning of admission with identical back pressure.

some numbness and tingling in both hands and diaphoresis and
dizziness upon rising.  She awoke her daughter who brought
her into the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital Emergency Department.

In the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital Emergency Department, the
patient was found to have 1-mm ST elevations in lead III
along with ST depressions in I and aVL.  She was given
sublingual nitroglycerin, started on heparin and Integrilin
drip and made pain free in the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital
Emergency Department.

She was then Med-Flighted over to [**Hospital1 190**] for cardiac catheterization.  En route, the
patient had the onset of chest pain and was known to have a
possible ST elevations in right-sided V4 leads.

In the cardiac catheterization laboratory here at [**Hospital1 346**], the patient was found to have a
cardiac output of 7.42, a cardiac index of 3.93, a pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 17, and a proximally occluded
right coronary artery.  The right coronary artery lesion was
stented, but her course was complicated by temporary complete
heart block after a ballooning of the lesion with associated
hypotension.  She necessitated temporary pacing and a
dopamine infusion.

The patient was then transported to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Pulmonary embolism times one.
2.  Deep venous thrombosis times one.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Knee surgery.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Protonix.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with two daughters.  [**Name (NI) 1403**] in
insurance litigation office.  She has a 15-pack-year history
of tobacco but quit 15 years ago.  She denies any alcohol or
drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother had a coronary artery bypass
graft at the age of 50.  Father had a myocardial infarction
at the age of 47.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reports six months of
postprandial epigastric pain with a sour taste rising in her
throat that has not been relieved by a proton pump inhibitor.
She also notes several weeks of weakness in both hands; worse
upon awakening.  At baseline, the patient reports getting
short of breath when climbing one flight of stairs and
occasional left ankle swelling.  She denies any orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or palpitations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Upon arrival to the
Unit, the patient had the following vital signs.  Her weight
was 77 kg, her temperature was 95, her blood pressure was
99/60, she was on 3 mcg/kg per minute of dopamine.  Her heart
rate was 73, in a normal sinus rhythm.  She was breathing 19
and oxygen saturation was 98% on 2 liters.  In general, she
was lying in bed.  She was nauseous but in no acute distress.
She was speaking in full sentences.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The oropharynx was moist with specks of
blood of in the mouth; but otherwise clear.  The neck was
supple.  No bruits.  Jugular venous distention was roughly
8 cm to 9 cm.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm, normal first heart sound and second heart
sound, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The lungs revealed
decreased breath sounds at the right lower lobe; but
otherwise clear to auscultation.  The abdomen was obese,
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Normal active bowel
sounds.  Extremities revealed she had a right groin site
without a hematoma with the sheath still in.  She had good
distal pulses bilaterally.  Neurologically, alert and
oriented times three.  She moved all extremities.  She had
4/5 strength in the left hand and left foot with normal 3+
reflexes bilaterally and symmetrically.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA FROM THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  At the
outside hospital she had the following laboratories; white
blood cell count was 4.6, hematocrit was 43.5, and platelets
were 204.  PT was 12.2, PTT was 22, and INR was 1.  Sodium
was 140, potassium was 4, chloride was 107, bicarbonate was
25, blood urea nitrogen was 16, creatinine was 0.8, and blood
glucose was 137.  Her LDH was 161.  Creatine kinase was 33.
MB was 1.5.  Index was 4.5.  Troponin was 0.10.  She had
creatine kinases which peaked at 1068 and subsequently
declined to 759, and a MB which peaked at 145 and
subsequently declined to 196.  Her total cholesterol was 211,
low-density lipoprotein was 127, high-density lipoprotein was
39, triglycerides were 227.  Protein culture and sensitivity
studies were pending at the time of discharge.  Hemoglobin
A1c was pending at the time of discharge as well.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   The initial electrocardiogram at the
outside hospital showed a normal sinus rhythm at 75, normal
axis, normal intervals, 0.5-mm asymmetric ST depressions in
aVL and I and 1-mm ST elevations in III.

Here, as previously mentioned, the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization with the previously mentioned results.  She
also had subsequent laboratory values.

She had an electrocardiogram on the day after admission which
showed  a normal sinus rhythm at 68, normal axis, and
intervals.  She had Q waves in II, III, and aVF with flipped
T waves in III and aVF; and she had resolution of the ST
elevations in III and the ST depressions in I and aVL.

She had a chest x-ray here at [**Hospital1 188**] which showed a heart size at the upper limit of
normal, bilateral interstitial opacities consistent with mild
congestive heart failure.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  Her laboratories
on the day of discharge were as follows; her sodium was 140,
potassium was 3.9, chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 23,
blood urea nitrogen was 11, creatinine was 0.6, and blood
glucose was 110.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  As previously mentioned, the
patient had a likely inferior myocardial infarction with
possible right ventricular involvement.

She was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where
a proximal right coronary artery lesion had a stent placed
and was subsequently treated with Integrilin, heparin,
aspirin, and Plavix.  She was also started on a beta blocker
and ACE inhibitor in house.

She did well and was pain free throughout the duration of her
hospital stay with the exception of the day following
catheterization when she experienced mild infrascapular back
pain lasting 20 minutes which spontaneously resolved without
any change in her electrocardiogram.

Her blood pressure remained between 90 and 100 systolic, and
she tolerated the ACE inhibitor and beta blocker well.  She
did have some persistent nausea and some vomiting for the 24
hours status post catheterization which was treated
successfully with Zofran.

From a rhythm standpoint, she remained in a normal sinus
rhythm throughout the duration of her hospital stay with
occasional premature ventricular contractions.

For her coronary artery disease; as previously mentioned, she
had right coronary artery lesion that was stented.  She was
to remain on Plavix for one year, aspirin, beta blocker, ACE
inhibitor, and Lipitor.

2.  ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient had some mildly elevated
blood sugars of slightly greater than 120 during her hospital
stay.  She has no previous past medical history, and her
hemoglobin A1c was pending.  On discharge, she should follow
up with this with her primary care physician to ensure she
does not have diabetes which is contributing to her coronary
artery disease.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good
