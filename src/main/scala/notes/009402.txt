History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a 47y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] w/ a PMH of PAF, HTN, morbid obesity and
OSA who presents today with respiratory distress.  He was in his
USOH until approximately 1wk ago when he noted that his asthma
became worse.  He developed an exacerbation of his "chronic
smokers cough" that was productive of white or brown sputum.  At
this time, the patient also noted increased SOB and wheezing,
especially with exercise. He denies any CP, abdominal pain, N/V,
viral symptoms, fevers, or sick contacts over the past week.
.
On the day of admission, the patient presented to his PCP's
office with the complaints above plus malaise for a week.  He
was sent to an OSH ER where a CXR showed no pulmonary process
but ABG showed hypercarbia and a resultant respiratory acidosis.
 He was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his
respiratory complaints.
.
In the ED, the patient was treated with nebulizers, lasix, and
solumedrol with symptomatic improvement in his complaints.
However, he remained hypercarbic and eventually required a 50%
FM to maintain his SpO2 > 90%.
.
Per the patient he was diagnosed with asthma after receiving
PFTs at an OSH but rarely uses his inhalers.  His major trigger
is cold temperatures and he has never been intubated for his
asthma although he does note "lots" of hospitalizations in his
lifetime related to breathing problems.

tte: Image quality is suboptimal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be
reliably assessed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed. There is
no pericardial effusion.
