Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
EKG changes, coronary stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
catheterization with Bare metal stent to Left circumflex artery

History of Present Illness:
67 F with hx CAD s/p RCA and LCx stents, PVD s/p aortobifem
bypass and R CEA (with 99% restenosis), CHF,ischemic
cardiomyopathy s/p ICD (previous EF 25%, now 50 %), s/p ICD who
initially presented to [**Hospital **] med ctr in [**Month (only) 956**] with diarrhea
and found to have ischemic colitis s/p 2 colectomy with 2
colostomies. Sent to [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-22**] and refused by that
rehab due to TWI V2-V4 on ECG done by EMS enroute, unclear why.
Sent to LGH and where she had a trop T 0.18 and flat CKs without
any symptoms. Was noted to have Course complicated by flash
pulmonary edema with transfer to CCU. She was subsequently
underwent diagnostic cath on [**3-27**] showing 80% LCx 80-90% stenosis
proximal to previous stents and total occlusion RCA with L to R
collaterals. She has now been transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
interventional cath.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On arrival to the CCU HR 80s, BP 110-130s, has TLC. She
continued to be chest pain free. EKG showed LVH, diffuse TWI and
old QW in inferior leads. On arrival she was hypotensive with
MAPs to 64 howevr was asymptomatic. She noted to have nitropaste
on, presumably to control BP/aferload reduce given recent flash.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:67 F with hx CAD s/p RCA and LCx stents, PVD
s/p aortobifem bypass and R CEA (with 99% restenosis), CHF
(previous EF 25%, now 50 %) admitted for interventional cath
following diagnostic cath at OSH who continues to be
asymptomatic.
.
# CORONARIES:The patient has a 90% stenosis of left circumflex
as well as total occlusion of her RCA with collaterals. Her
troponin had been elevated to 0.18 at OSH but continued to trend
downwards and she remained chest pain free. She underwent
interventional cardiac catheterization during which a bare metal
stent was placed in her left circumflex artery proximal to her
pre-existing lesion. She was continued on aspirin, low dose
statin given transaminitis, and metoprolol. She did develop a
right femoral vein pseudoaneurysm and hematoma as a complication
of her cardiac catheterization and underwent ultrasound guided
thrombin injection which was successful. She will have a follow
up ultrasound as an outpatient as well as an evaluation with
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] surgery.
.
# PUMP: She had a hx of CHF with most recent Echo showing EF
50%, improved from 25 % previously. She had experienced flash
pulmonary edema at an outside hospital but was euvolemic on
admission to the CCU here. Given this her spironolactone and
lisinopriol were held. She will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 23097**], her
outpatient cardiologist, to determine when these medications
will be restarted.
.
# RHYTHM:She remained in sinus as determined by telemetry.
.
# Ischemic colitis: s/p cholectomy with dual colostomies. She
had been on TPN at the OSH and had developed transaminitis. Her
TPN was dc'd at [**Hospital1 18**] and surgery and nutrition consults
recommended enteral feeding with nutritional supplements. Wound
care consult service provided ostomy care. She has a PICC line
placed while she took TPN to supplement her p.o intake, however
she was able to take adequate p.o by calorie count and the TPN
and PICC were discontinued. She  should continue to have oral
intake with supplements for adequate nutrition.
.
# Anemia: Admitted [**3-11**] to All saints with bloody diarrhea
with crit drop to 22 with ischemic colitis ,with subsequent
x-lap, colostomy and blood transfusions. Also has known iron
deficiency with IV iron given [**3-18**]. HCT had been in mid 30s
this admission,guaic stools have been negative. She also had
prolonged bleeding at the site of her PICC placement which
eventually stopped with application of pressure and
reinforcement as well as right femoral vein hematoma and
pseudoaneurysm. After these events, her Hct drifted down to
23-24 but was stable over last 5 days. Her labs did not indicate
a coagulopathy. She will need to check a CBC after discharge.
.
# Weakness: thought secondary to deconditioning. PT evaluated,
recommended rehab.
.
# Back pain: this has been ongoing since the patient's mobility
has been limited and she has been in bed. She required oxycodone
for pain control, warm compresses and physical therapy.
