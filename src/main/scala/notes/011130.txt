Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 **] Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
gentleman with hypertension, primary aldosteronism,
hypothyroidism with an increased cough productive of yellow
sputum over the last four days, increased shortness of
breath, fatigue, and mild left ear pain who presented to his
primary care physician's office and was found to be hypoxic
to 80% on room air.

The patient then presented to the Emergency Department where
he had the following vital signs.  His temperature was 96.3
degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 53, his blood pressure
was 74/53, his respiratory rate was 26, and his oxygen
saturation was 92% on room air.  The patient had a chest
x-ray which showed lingula and left lower lobe pneumonia.  He
was given intravenous fluids, started on Levaquin, had
nebulizers times three, was given hydrocortisone, and was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further
management.

The patient was found to be in acute renal failure with a
fractional excretion of sodium of 4% and a creatinine of 4.6.
This was thought to be prerenal.  In the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, the patient was aggressively hydrated and cultured
and given Levaquin.  The patient was stabilized and
transferred to the floor team.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No chest pain.  No abdominal pain.  No
nausea or vomiting.  No fevers.  No decreased urine output.
Positive for chronic diarrhea since the age of 17.  Positive
for sick contacts in his grandchildren.

1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hyperaldosteronism and adenoma in the adrenal gland.
3.  Hypothyroidism (on Synthroid).
4.  Chronic diarrhea.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (At home)
1.  Digoxin 0.25 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Procardia 90 mg by mouth once per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 97.9,
his heart rate was 72, his blood pressure was 140/66, his
respiratory rate was 20, and his oxygen saturation was 98% on
room air.  The patient was in no acute distress.  He was
unable to complete sentences because of his shortness of
breath and cough.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the extraocular movements were intact.
The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The
mucous membranes were moist.  The oropharynx was clear.  No
nasal discharge at this time.  Neck revealed no jugular
venous distention.  There was no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Pulmonary examination
revealed rhonchi at the bases bilaterally up to the middle
lung fields bilaterally.  Abdominal examination revealed the
abdomen was soft and nontender.  Mild distention.  There were
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed no clubbing or
cyanosis.  There was 1+ edema to below the knee.
Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses were palpated
bilaterally and were 2+.  Neurologic examination revealed
cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   White blood
cell count was 5.8, his hematocrit was 36.5, and his
platelets were 128.  His INR was 1.1.  Notable creatinine was
4 on admission.  Thyroid-stimulating hormone was less than
0.02.  The patient was influenza A and B antigen negative.
Urinalysis was positive for group B streptococcus.  The
patient had blood cultures sent.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with hypertension,
hyperaldosteronism, and hypothyroidism who presented with
symptoms of cough, hypoxia, hypotension, acute renal failure,
and pneumonia.  He was stabilized in the Emergency Department
and in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and then transferred
to the floor for further treatment.

1.  PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient was placed on nasal
cannula oxygen and titrated to oxygen saturations of greater
than 93%.  He was given nebulizers albuterol and Atrovent
q.4-6h. and then transitioned to meter-dosed inhalers with a
good response.

The patient was maintained on a pulmonary toilet by Physical
Therapy to loosen secretions.  As well, he had suction placed
at the bedside.  The patient was continued on Levaquin and
monitored for sensitivities.

Blood cultures demonstrated streptococcal pneumonia (moderate
growth) that was sensitive to levofloxacin.  Urine cultures
(as reported) were positive for beta streptococcus group B,
and 2/2 bottles on [**12-24**] were positive for the
streptococcal pneumonia.  Further blood cultures were
nasogastric.  The patient was treated with a good response on
levofloxacin as it was sensitive to this medication.

The patient recovered well.  On [**12-27**], the patient
complained of increased shortness of breath.  The patient had
been given intravenous fluids for hypotension until that
time.  It was thought the patient was over hydrated.  He was
diuresed with 20 mg of Lasix.  A chest x-ray showed improving
but persistent left upper lobe consolidation and small
effusion layers on the left decubitus view.  The patient
responded well to 20 mg of Lasix and improved.  At discharge,
the patient was saturating 95% on room air.

2.  HEMODYNAMIC ISSUES:  The patient was initially
hypotensive when he was admitted for the sepsis in the
Intensive Care Unit.  He was aggressively hydrated.  The
patient's blood pressure medications were held, and his blood
pressure was carefully monitored on the floor.

On hospital day two, the patient's systolic blood pressure
was 142.  On hospital day three, the patient's blood pressure
ranged from 150 to 171/80s to 90s.  The patient's home blood
pressure medications were slowly added with a good response.

3.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  The patient has a history of
hyperaldosteronism and hypothyroidism; being treated on
Synthroid.  The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone on
admission was less than 0.01.

The patient's endocrinologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient refuses a change in his thyroid
hormone dosage or an adrenalectomy for his primary
hyperaldosteronism state but does follow closely with him as
an outpatient.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] suggested continuing the patient
on his current dose of Synthroid with close followup as an
outpatient.

The patient was given pulse steroids on admission for his
hyperaldosteronism state in response to physiologic stress.

4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's acute renal
failure improved with fluids and was thought to be consistent
with a prerenal picture as his blood urea nitrogen to
creatinine ratio was greater than 20:1.  The patient's
baseline creatinine was 1.5 noted on [**2103-8-28**].  The
patient was initially admitted with a creatinine of 4 which
came down to 1.3 with careful hydration prior to the
patient's discharge.

5.  DIARRHEA ISSUES:  The patient has had chronic diarrhea
since the age of 17.  He was continued on his home dose of
Lomotil.  The patient was maintained on a low-sodium diet.
His potassium and sodium were carefully monitored and were
stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumococcal pneumonia bacteremia.
2.  Acute renal failure.
3.  Shortness of breath.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Chronic renal failure.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 311**]
as soon as possible for monitored of his blood pressure
(telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1713**]).
2.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**2106-2-9**] at 4 p.m.
3.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on the next available appointment (telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2296**]).
