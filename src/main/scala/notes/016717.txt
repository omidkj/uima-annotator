Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
obstructive urolithasis of left ureter

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Percutaneous nephrostomy tube
Mechanical Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 85775**] is a 54 year old female with a history of
non-celiac enteritis, DM and HTN who presented to the ED in the
morning of [**8-21**] with LLQ pain, nausea and emesis.  At that time,
the patient underwent abdominal CT that revealed an 8x4mm
ureteral stone with mild hydronephrosis and stranding.  The
patient received good pain control and was discharged from the
ED.
.
Today, the patient returned to the ED with fever to 104.0, AMS
and hypotension.  In the ED, vitals were 99.7 108 90/51 (on
levo) 98% 2L.  Seen by urology in the ED and concern for
obstructive pyelo.  Given vanc/zosyn, 4L and started on
levophed.  Will receive percutaneous nephrostomy tube then
transfer to the MICU for further management of HD instability.

MICU Transfer HPI:

Ms. [**Known lastname 85775**] is a 54 y/o Female who originally presented to the
ED in the morning of [**8-21**] with LLQ pain, nausea and emesis. At
that time, the patient underwent abdominal CT that revealed an
8x4mm ureteral stone with mild hydronephrosis and stranding.
The patient received good pain control and was discharged from
the ED. The next day the patient returned to the ED with fever
to 104.0, AMS and hypotension. The patient presented to the ED
febrile to 101.4, hypotensive and with AMS.  CT abdomen showed
left sided hydronephrosis the setting of obstructing stone in
left ureter.  She became hypotensive in the ED and started on
phenylephrine. Initial labs showed a Lactate elevated to 2.6.
WBC 0.9 with 6 bands. She was treated with vanc/zosyn,
aggressively fluid repleated and taken emergently to IR for
percutaneous drainage. Patient was intubated prior to the
procedure and had a left nephrostomy tube placed.
.
After the procedure she was transfered to the MICU where she had
escalating pressor and fluid boluses, ultimately requiring three
pressors and vasopressin. She developed multi-organ failure with
transaminitis, [**Last Name (un) **] (creatinine of 4.7 from 0.9 at baseline), and
DIC. Patient was started on stress dose steroids at 50mg Q6H
given history of prednisone use. The patient's Lactate steadily
rose to a high of 4.8, a pH Of 7.19 and a central venous sat of
89%. While sepsis was the presumed cause a TTE was obtained and
showed mild global LV hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %), moderate
pulm artery HTN w/ TR gradient 52 mm Hg. CXR showed possible
mediastinal widening post-central line placement, concerning for
mediastinal hematoma but repeat imaging more consistent with
pulmonary edema/ vascular congestion. Blood cultures grew out
GNRs in [**5-8**] bottles, later speciated to pan-sensitive E coli.
Her antibiotics were ultimately narrowed to ceftriaxone.
.
Over the intervening 24 hours the patient's hemodynamic needs
became less acute and was weaned to levophed only and extubated.
 Post-extubation the patient continued to rapidly improve and
was weaned from all pressor support 48hrs after presentation.
The patient was then transferred to the floor for further
management.

.
TTE [**8-22**]:Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is mildly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is probably mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high
cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
