Successful coil embolization of distal gastroduodenal artery
from the SMA where contrast extravasation was seen during
diagnostic arteriography indicating active bleeding. 2.
Occlusion of the proximal aspect of the gastroduodenal artery
which may represent thrombosis, tumor encasement, or severe
spasm.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 50 year old male with newly diagnosed B cell
lymphoma presents with jaundice and acute upper GI bleed.
.
# GIB: Hct drop from 32 to 23.8 in the setting of massive
hematemesis overnight. Admited to the MICU and was initially
transfused 4 U in 3 hours.  Source was ulcerated mass in antrum
of stomach.  PPI gtt was started, cold water lavages, and ERCP
was called but deferred as they though they would be unable to
control the bleeding. He was taken to IR for messenteric
embolization.  He required a total of 6 units during the first
24 hrs in ICU and 2 additional units prior to going to floor. On
the floor no additional bleeding and stable HCT.
.
#. Biliary Obstruction secondary to malignancy: Stented by ERCP.
 His LFTs came down quickly after stenting. On discharge
bilirubin was 1.5.
.
#. B cell lymphoma: Biopsies from ERCP came back as diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma.   When stable patient was transferred to
BMT service. Pt completed 4 days of XRT and 5 days of
dexamethosone prior to starting [**Hospital1 **]. Patient stated Cycle 1
[**Hospital1 **] - 50% dose reduction of Etoposide, Vincristine,
Doxorubicin, Full dose Cytoxan and Prednisone. Day 1 of [**Hospital1 **]
