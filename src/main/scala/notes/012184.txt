History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 56835**] is a 76 year old man with a history of hypertension,
type II diabetes mellitus, ESRD on HD, rectal cancer s/p
resection and partial colectmy who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
with fatigue and a hematacrit drop noted at hemodialysis today.
He last saw his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**7-11**] and complained of fatigue. A CBC was
checked and he had a hct of 31 when his previous hct in [**Month (only) 958**]
was 40 (although he's bounced between the mid-20's and 40
before). This morning, a hct was checked and it was noted to be
19.6 and was 23.6 p dialysis after 3 kg was removed today. The
stool in his colostomy was also noted to be guiac positive.

The patient reports increasing DOE over the prior 3-4 weeks PTA,
worse in the evening; "darkening" stool for 1-2 weeks PTA,
increased amounts of gas. The patient has also complained of
intermittent nausea and vomiting approximately for 1 hour after
meals for about 2 weeks but only would vomit up food; denies
hematemesis or coffee ground emesis. He has noted some
lightheadedness and dizziness but no syncopal episodes. He
reports non-radiating substernal chest pressure when nauseous
that was often relieved by vomiting; denies associated
diaphoresis or dyspnea; chest pressure not worse with exertion.
.
Denies prior episode of melanotic stools.
.
ROS: denies fevers, chills, weight loss, cough, orthopnea, PND,
visual changes, abdominal pain, weakness, numbness/paresthesias.

.
DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED  [**2200-7-24**] 4:53 PM
1. Normal grayscale and Doppler examination of the liver. Air in
the common duct could be related to the endoscopy of earlier
today.
2. Normal appearance of the spleen and a patent splenic vein at
the hilum. The peripancreatic portions of the splenic vein could
be assessed with CT or MRI, since the pancreatic bed was
obscured by bowel gas.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2200-7-25**] 11:59 PM
IMPRESSION: Left costophrenic angle blunting which likely
represents a small left pleural effusion. No other acute process
is demonstrated.
.
[**2200-7-22**] EGD:
Nodule in the middle third of the esophagus
Enlarged gastric folds
Blood in the stomach
Polyps in the duodenal bulb
No blood was seen in the duodenum.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
[**2200-7-24**] EGD:
Enlarged gastric folds vs gastric varices were seen in the
fundus. A blood clot and some fresh blood was seen.
Polyp in the duodenum
A very small nodule vs vein was seen in the mid esophagus. There
was no bleeding.
Blood in the stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  [**2200-7-26**] 11:13 AM
1) Soft tissue mass within the duodenum causing dilatation of
the distal common bile duct. It is unclear, on this examination,
if this mass arises from the ampulla or duodenal wall. Further
evaluation of the distal CBD and pancreatic ducts should be
performed with ERCP. However, if the sphincter cannot be
assessed via ERCP, MR imaging of this region could be performed
following duodenal distention with oral contrast (water).
2) Pneumobilia; this may be related to a prior procedure, such
as sphincterotomy.
3) Cholecystectomy.
4) Findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
5) Hemosiderosis.
6) Incompletely characterized left lower pole renal mass. It is
felt that calcifications are causing the decreased signal on
both T1 and T2-weighted images. Noncontrast CT would be helpful
to confirm the presence of calcification.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2200-7-29**]
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Symmetric LVH
with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Moderate aortic stenosis with mild aortic
regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2199-6-24**], aortic stenosis may have slightly progressed.
Pulmonary hypertension is no longer appreciated. The other
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 76 year old man with Type II DM, ESRD on
HD, who present with 3-4 week history of fatigue, 1-2 weeks of
"dark stool" found to be severely anemic, with melanotic stools.

ED Course: NG lavage in the ED was notable for pink return with
some small clots.  The pink color lightened but did not clear.
His HR was stable in the 80's and his blood pressure was stable
in the 130's systolic. He was given IV protonix and 1 u prbc and
transferred to the MICU for further care.

ICU Course: In the ICU his hem
