History of Present Illness:
We were called to see patient who was noted to be increasingly
lethargic, tachypneic, with slightly increasing oxygen
requirement. The patientis a 72M w/ multiple medical problems
including NSCLC metastatic to the brain, recent SAH, DM2, CAD
s/p CABGx3, HTN, chronic kidney disease who was admitted on
[**2184-1-16**] with altered mental status and hypoxia. He was intubated
and found to have a Psuedomonas pneumonia. He was started on
cefipime, linezolid, levofloxacin with resolution of his mental
status changes and fevers. He was extubated on [**1-22**] and sent to
the floor.
.
While on the floor he triggered briefly for hypoxia, thought to
be due to mucous plugging. He was noted to be coughing up large
amounts of purulent sputum. On [**1-28**] he coughed up ?TF into his
face mask and likely aspirated some. Since then he has become
more somnolent and tachypneic and secretions have been copious
with the appearance of tube feeds.
.
On the floor he was tachynpeic to the 30s with increased work of
breathing. He was initially satting in the mid- to upper-90s on
a shovel mask with 100% humidified oxygen. ABG was 7.44/34/71
and he was placed on a non-rebreather. After transfer to the
unit, his O2sat was noted to drop to the mid-80s on NRB. Repeat
ABG was 7.44/38/55. The patient's SBP dropped to 80 and Levophed
was started through his LIJ CVL. Anesthesia was called and the
patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
The patient's wife and daughter arrived at the hospital and a
family meeting with the palliative care attending was held. The
family expressed that they thought he might want everything done
although they admitted they were not sure and that they were
waiting for his physicians to say nothing more could be done.
However, they clearly stated they wanted him to be resuscitated,
knowing that he might not survive a resuscitation attempt.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt came to the MICU and was intubated for hypoxemia.  His course
was complicated by pseudomonas pneumonia and aspiration
pneumonia.  Pt was supported by pressors in the ICU and was kept
alive on the breathing machine.  On the day of the patient's
death, he stopped making urine and his blood pressure dropped.
Shortly thereafter, in view of the patients ventilator
requirements, his worsening blood pressure, his dx of terminal
lung cancer, the decision was made to make the patient CMO.  He
was extubated and expired shortly thereafter with his family at
his bedside.
