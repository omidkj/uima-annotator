Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
Multiple Pulmonary Embolism

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible bronchoscopy, Esophagoscopy with biopsy, right
Thoracotomy with decortication and pleurectomy


History of Present Illness:
45 year-old male with h/o tobacco abuse and multiloculated
large right pleural effusion, transferred from [**Hospital6 **] with multiple pulmonary emboli, bilaterally following
non-diagnostic right thoracoscopy. The patient was initially
admitted on [**2128-10-26**] to Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital3 **] with
shortness of breath. On admit, the patient reported several
month
h/o anorexia, fatigue, and 20 lb weight loss over past 2-3
months. A CXR, ultrasound, and CT chest were obtained which
revealed a large right pleural effusion. A thoracentesis was
attempted but only a few mL of serosanginous fluid were
obtained.
The patient was subsequently scheduled for a right thoracoscopy
on [**2128-10-26**]. Intra-operatively the patient was noted to have a
very sanguinous effusion with multiple fibrinous adhesions and
nodularity of the parietal pleura. 140cc mL of pleural fluid was
drained. Adhesions were taken down and multiple parietal pleural
biopsies were obtained, although found to be nondiagnostic.
Final
pathology revealed chronic fibrinous and fibrous pleuritis with
no evidence of malignancy. Pleural fluid WBC=440, RBC=[**Numeric Identifier 76029**],
Total protein=2.4, LDH=991, Glucose=4, Amylase=13. One chest
tube
was placed and then removed on POD#1. The patient was
hemodynamically stable and oxygen saturation was 96% on 3L Nc.
On
POD#2, the patient was noted to desaturate with ambulation to
80%s. When placed back on oxygen, saturation was 89% to 91% on
3L
nasal cannula. The patient then ambulated independently without
oxygen and had a syncopal episode. He was found unreponsive on
the floor, spontaneously recovering when placed on 100%
nonrebreather. The patient subsequently underwent a CT
angiogram,
which revealed multiple pulmonary emboli, bilaterally, small
mediastinal lymph nodes, and right hydropneumothorax with
compressive atelectasis of RML and RLL and small foci of
ground-glass opacity within RUL. The patient was started on
heparin gtt (3000U bolus with 1000U/hr) and an IVC filter was
placed. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
and management.

Rads:
ECHO [**10-29**]: R ventricular cavity enlargement w/free wall
hypokinesis c/w primary pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary
embolism) or primary right venricular cardiomyopathy. Dilated
thoracic aorta.

LENIS [**10-29**]: No deep vein thrombosis in either leg. Incidentally
noted is an arrhythmia and the bidirectional flow of the venous
waveforms suggests right heart failure.

RUE U/S [**11-3**]: no DVT

CXR [**11-9**]: Right lower lobe atelectasis, No PTX

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU as a transfer from an OSH with a
multiloculated large right pleural effusion, multiple pulmonary
emboli, right hydropneumothorax and was found to desat when off
O2. Upon arrival to the floor the patient was started on a
heparin drip and was scheduled for lower extremity dopplars and
an ECHO. ECHO revealed right ventricular wall hypokinesis and
enlargement which were consistent with PE and CT showed possible
small bowel wall thickening. Patient remained stable while in
the ICU and was then transferred to the floor on HD#2 with plans
to go to the OR on [**11-2**]. On [**11-2**] patient underwent a right
thoracotomy, decortication and drainage of hemothorax. Patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the SICU
postop with 3 chest tubes to suction. On POD#1 pt spiked a fever
to 102.6 for which he was pan cultured. Cultures revealed gram
positive cocci from the sputum and BAL. Patient was advanced to
clears on POD#2, foley was D/C'd on POD#3 and was transferred to
the floor on POD#5. On POD#3 the patient was found to be in
A-fib and was subsequently started on amiodarone. The anterior
apical tube was D/C'd on [**11-7**], posterior/apical tube on [**11-8**]
and the anterior tube was D/C'd on [**11-9**]. Patient was started on
coumadin on POD#6 with plans to discharge the patient when the
INR became therapeutic. On POD#9 pt had an INR of 2.5 and was
deemed stable for discharge. Upon discharge the patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs, normal sinus rhythm,
tolerating po diet, O2 saturation was 93% on room air and had a
therapeutic INR. Patient will follow up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-15**] to
have his INR monitored and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**12-30**]
weeks.
