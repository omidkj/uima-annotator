History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 15685**] is a 48yo female patient who is intubated at the
time of transfer from [**Hospital3 **].  All information is per
OSH records.

This 48yoF has a history of alcoholism with recent detox, HTN,
depression, anxiety/PTSD who presented to [**Hospital1 **] yesterday after
about 24 hours of worsening shortness of breath, headache,
non-productive cough, and subjective fevers and chills. She
presented in severe respiratory distress with a room air
saturation of 73% and subsequently was placed on BiPap.  Her
respiratory distress persisted with tachypnea into the 30s and
so she was electively intubated.  Her WBC count was noted to be
19.3 (83%PMN) with a CXR showing patchy bilateral infiltrates
consistent with pneumonia.  She was treated with vancomycin,
moxifloxacin, tamiflu. ID recommended addition of ertapenem,
however it is unclear if she received this prior to transfer.
She required high doses of propofol for sedation, and eventually
became hypotensive, requiring pressor support.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], her initial VS were, initial vs were:
T100.2 axillary P107  BP121/61  R19  O2 sat92% on100%Fi02. Her
vent was set to CMV Vt420, Rate20, PEEP12, Fi02100%.  She was
sedated, no ROS could be elicited.

Past Medical History:
-hypertension
-anxiety disorder
-depression
-PTSD
-alcohol abuse s/p detox one month ago- during which she had a
seizure

Social History:
1ppd smoker but no current alcohol or IVDA


Family History:
father had CAD, also alcoholism

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2108-5-22**]
- CXR: Supine positioning increases the cardiomediastinal
caliber and causes pleural effusions to obscure large areas of
lung. Nevertheless there appear to be both widespread
interstitial pulmonary abnormality as well as bibasilar
consolidation, cardiomegaly, vascular engorgement and an
indeterminate volume of pleural effusion. All this would be
better evaluated with upright radiographs, when feasible.  ET
tube tip with the chin down is less than 15 mm from the carina,
approximately 2 cm below optimal placement. Right internal
jugular line passes at least as far as the upper right atrium
but the tip is obscured.  Nasogastric tube ends in the upper
stomach. No pneumothorax.

[**2108-5-24**]
- Echocardiogram: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Vigorous biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.

[**2108-5-24**]
- CT head w/o contrast: No acute intracranial process, although
this study is limited due to patient motion.
- CT chest/abd/pelvis: 1. Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema and
small bilateral pleural effusions. 2. Left lower lobe
consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.  3. Within the
limitations of this non-contrast CT, no acute intra-abdominal or
intrapelvic process.

[**2108-5-29**]
MR head w/o contrast: 1. T1-hyperintensity of the pituitary,
without enlargement or a fluid level, which may indicate either
mild hemorrhage or a small lesion, such as an adenoma.
Correlation with endocrinologic labs could be helpful. Dedicated
MRI of the pituitary is suggested when the patient is stable. 2.
No evidence of significant abnormalities in the brain parenchyma
or along the cranial nerves on noncontrast evaluation.

[**2108-6-6**] MRI of the pituitary with contrast:
1. Completely unremarkable appearance to the pituitary gland
with no evidence of hemorrhage, micro- or macro-adenoma, or
other lesion. The apparent findings involving the gland on the
prompting study were likely
technical/artifactual in nature.
2. No acute intracranial process.
3. No pathologic focus of enhancement elsewhere in the brain.
4. Fluid-opacification of numerous mastoid air cells, which may
relate to
previous intubated status but should be correlated clinically.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 48 year old woman who presented to [**Hospital3 4107**]
with presumed multifocal pneumonia and subsequently developed
acute hypoxic respiratory distress consistent with ARDS. She was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Her initial
presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] was consistent with [**Doctor Last Name **]/ARDS with very
poor oxygenation. It is thought that this was related to an
underlying pneumonia. She initially required heavy sedation as
well as paralytics to allow proper ventilation setting.  She was
also started on very broad spectrum antibiotics, including
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl (for
aspiration), and Tamiflu (for possible viral etiology). She was
eventually narrowed to cefepime and finished 8-day course.
Sputum culture was negative. Esophageal balloon was used to
allow better estimation of the need for her PEEP.  She improved
with PEEP of 18-20 initially.  Ultimately, she was able to
tolerate off paralytics and then extubated successfully. She did
have septic shock with hypotension and tachycardia on
presentation.  She presented on norepinephrine support for
hypotension.  It was thought that her hypotension and
tachycardia was from septic shock from the pulmonary infection.
A line was placed for better monitoring and then eventually
removed.  She was weaned off norepinephrine and was able to
maintain her BP
