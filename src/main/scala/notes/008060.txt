History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 6359**] is a 71M with hx of CAD s/p cabg, sCHF (EF 25-30%),
vtach on mexilitene/sotalol who p/w SOB, found to be hypoxic.
The pt states that he had been "feeling crappy" for a week, with
predominant symptoms being SOB, fatigue, cough productive of
white to rusty colored sputum. He endorsed increased dyspnea on
exertion, orthopnea, a day of chills, and decreased appetite. He
denied fevers, nightsweats, chest pain, LE edema, n/v/diarrhea.
He endorsed taking his home meds and denied any dietary
indiscretions.

The pt presented to clinic today complaining of dyspnea x1 wks,
was found to be hypoxic, satting 88%RA. He was sent to the ED
where was he found to be 99.3 75 138/62 24 97%4Lnc. He continued
to be tachypneic and was increased to a non-rebreather and then
bipap. He had an abg 7.49/32/187/25. Trop <0.01. He had a cxr
showing diffused pulmonary edema, L>R with obscuration of the
cardiac borders, no focal opacity, no effusions. He was given
lasix 20mg IV, CTX 1g IV, and azithro 500mg PO. He also received
ntg sl x1 and lorazepam 2mg IV x1.

In the MICU the pt was 99/1 67 130/64 22 97% on bipap. He was
given another dose of lasix 20mg IV and continued on
ctx/azithro. He was weaned from bipap to nrb with stable sats in
the upper 90s, continued RR in the 20s-30s. The pt stated he
felt markedly improved.

oxygen
GEN: elderly man, in no acute distress, comfortable
HEENT: MMM, no lymphadenopathy

Pertinent Results:
[**2184-9-29**] TTE
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferolateral and
inferior walls and hypokinesis of the anterior wall, apex, and
lateral wall (EF 20-25%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricular cavity. Severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel
CAD. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-6-19**],
left ventricular cavity is more dilated. Regional dysfunction is
more severe with hypokinesis of the anterior wall. There is more
mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
71M with hx of CAD s/p cabg, sCHF (EF 20-25%), vtach on
mexilitene/sotalol who p/w SOB and eventually developed hypoxic
respiratory failure requiring an extended period of mechanical
ventilation complicated by ARDS and VAP.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: On presentation patient
with O2 sats in the 80s on RA, tachypneic to the 30s-40s.
Patient initially covered for CAP with CTX and azithro and was
aggressively diuresed. Antibiotics were broadened to
vanc/cefepime/azithro after respiratory decompensation and
intubation. His CXR at that time showed dramatic worsening of
bilateral pulmonary edema.  Though he has severe CHF with a TTE
showing worsening systolic function (20-25%), there was probably
a component of ARDS leading to his respiratory decompensation.
He completed a CAP course of CTX/azithro while ventilated. About
8 days into ventilation on [**10-4**], he developed a VAP. Antibiotics
were broadened to vancomycin/cefepime/tobramycin.  He was
extubated on [**10-7**]. Vancomycin was stopped on [**10-8**] due to low
MRSA suspicion. He completed 8 days of tobramycin and cefepime.
His oxygen requirement gradually improved and he was transferred
to the general medicine floor. On the medicine floor, he
remained somewhat hypoxic off oxygen and while walking, but had
an O2 sat in the mid-90s on 2L NC. He had completed his
antibiotic course prior to discharge.

# SHOCK: Septic and cardiogenic. From pneumonia as above,
briefly required pressors.  EF decreased to 25% in setting of
acute illness.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: In the MICU, Cr increased to 1.5 and was assume to be
acute kidney injury from tobramycin. Tobramycin was stopped as
course was almost completed. Creatinine remained stable but
elevated at 1.5. Losartan and lasix were both held but should be
restarted when creatinine has improved.


# GOUT: He complained of knee pain that was similar to pain
experienced with gout. He was treated with tylenol PRN.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# CHF: A repeat TTE during this hospitalization showed worsening
ejection fraction of 20-25%. CHF may have contributed to
worsening of respiratory status. On discharge, medications were
unchanged except losartan and lasix were held pending
improvement of creatinine.

# VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA: Patient with hx of vtach not resolved
with epicardial ablation, currently stable on mexiletine and
sotalol. Patient with increasing runs of Vtach during
hospitalization. Aggressively repleted lytes with improvement in
ectopy.

# CAD s/p CABG. Patient continued on home carvedilol, plavix,
aspirin and simvastatin. Losartan was held due to [**Last Name (un) **]. Should be
restarted when creatinine improves.

# BPH: flomax continued

# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Held simvastin given interaction with azithro
and risk for rhabdo; after azitro completed statin held in the
setting of transamintitis. Restarte
