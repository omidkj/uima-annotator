Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
left weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68 yo right handed male with a history of
hypertension, alcoholism, and COPD who presents with a [**11-26**] day
history of left sided weakness and left finger paresthesias. He
was watching television on the night prior to admission while
eating dinner at 6:00 pm, and noted paresthesias/tingliness in
his left distal fingertips. He then realized that he was unable
to use his left hand and needed to use his right hand to move
his
left arm. However, his roommate says that the patient has had
weakness since 2 days PTA, requiring him to use a walker. His
roommate needed to cut up his food for him because he was unable
to do it himself. He also reported difficulty walking.. He
denied
any difficulty speaking. He denied headache or SOB. Of note, the
patient did fall and hit his head 2 days PTA, and hit his head
on
the left side, but denied any LOC. The patient decided that his
symptoms were so bad this morning when he woke up that his
roommate couldn't take care of him anymore, so he called EMS.
.
The patient arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and a Code Stroke was called
at 9:34 am. The neurology team arrived within 5 minutes. His
exam
showed L sided hemiparesis with L facial droop, 0/5 strength in
right arm, and 3/5 strength in right leg. His NIHSS score was
14.
He was immediately taken to the CT scanner, where CT head showed
a left insular hypodensity, and CTA showed decreased caliber of
the left intracranial carotid artery. It was determined that
since he was greater than 15 hours from the onset of his
symptoms, IV tPA was not indicated. However, the CT Perfusion
scan showed a mismatch between his blood volume and mean transit
time, indicating that brain could still be reperfused. He was
sent to the angio suite for carotid stent.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 68 yo man was admitted to the hospital with suspicion for
stroke after sustaining left sided weakness lasting for days. CT
showed somewhat triangular-shaped area of diminished density now
seen within the right insula with CT perfusion revealing poor
perfusion within majority of right middle cerebral artery
territories. CTA showed critical stenosis of the right internal
carotid artery origin with poor flow distally into the head and
consequently, pt went for placement of R-ICA stent following
[**Month/Day/Year 4532**] loading. Pt was initially stabilized in the neuro ICU and
was transferred to the stroke floor about 24 hours later.
Evaluation on the stroke floor revealed increased strength in
the left UE, at least antigravity (strenth had been 0 in the ER
initially).
   The pt's course was complicated by an episode of SOB and
tachycardia on the night of [**6-9**]. At the time, the pt's lungs
sounded roncherous, and CXR showed pulmonary congestion. He was
given 40 mg lasix IV and put out >500 mL urine, although in
retrospect, it was felt pt was no fluid overloaded. ABG showed a
respiratory alkalosis with poor pO2. Pt received CTA, which was
negative for PE, but showed a right basilar and RML infiltrate,
worrisome for aspiration. Pt was initially started on levoquin
and vanco (could not take zosyn secondary to PCN allergy), but
switched to Levoquin and flagyl for better anaerobic coverage.
His theophylline was held as a potential source for tachycardia,
and later restated when it was determined that his theophylline
level was actually subtherapeutic. Pt was transferred to a neuro
step-down bed. Pt had a subsequent video-swallow study, which
the pt passed, and was recommended for regular solids with thin
liquids, but w
