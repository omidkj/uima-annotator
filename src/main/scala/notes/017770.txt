Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation.
Bronchoscopy on [**2149-3-1**]
Bronchoscopy on [**2149-3-3**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75F h/o OSA with multiple intubations secondary to
tracheobronchomalacia s/p recent stenting in [**2149-2-14**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] who presented today with subjective feeling of SOB,
although sats initially at baseline (98-99 2L). She was also
noted to have have yellow sputum and increased facial edema.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.8 80 145/90 20 100 4L. She was
initially thought by ED to have a mild COPD exacerbation and
received nebs, solumedrol 125 X 1, and levaquin 750 X 1. She did
not receive IVFs. She was about to be moved to a floor bed when
her respirations became more labored, RR increased to 45, and HR
increased to sinus tachycardia in 130's. She was evaluated by IP
in ED, had a trial of bipap with minimal improvement. CXR
unchanged from prior. She also received 2mg IV ativan for
anxiety. She was intubated in ED, IP bronched her and saw no
mucous plug, clear and patent stent, and distal airways.
.
She arrived to ICU intubated and sedated with propofol. Of note,
her last spirometry showed no obstructive pattern. No clear
etiology for resp decline.
Review of sytems: not possible as patient intubated and sedated.

CTA [**2149-3-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism. The
subsegmental branches are not fully evaluated due to contrast
bolus timing and respiratory motion artifact.
2. No focal pulmonary consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Aerosolized secretions are noted within the indwelling tracheal
Y stent in the proximal right and left main stem bronchus in
conjunction with bronchial wall thickening and regions of
bronchiectasis within the right lower lobe which may suggest
superimposed infectious bronchitis.
3. Bilateral pulmonary nodules as described above. Based on
[**Last Name (un) 8773**] guidelines, if patient is at low risk, a dedicated
one-year followup CT would be recommended, if high risk, a
dedicated followup in [**7-4**] months would be recommended. If the
patient has outside CT imaging, comparison should be made to
assess for stability.
4. Atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and coronary
circulation.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions with regions of adjacent
compression atelectasis.
6. Left hepatic cyst with calcification
.
CXR [**2149-3-1**]:
There is moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged. Small bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are noted. There is
no definite consolidation or pneumothorax identified. Tracheal
stent is not clearly seen on this limited view. Extensive
calcifications of the aortic arch are noted.IMPRESSION: Tiny
bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. No
definite consolidation identified.

NOTES:


  Dx: COPD Spirometry: Fair test quality and reproducibility,
results are a
  composite of 2 different efforts. Lung Volumes: only one
reportable effort,
  good test quality. DLCO: unable to get reportable results due
to pt.
  difficulty performing test. BMI: 41.9

  Mechanics: The FVC is mildly reduced. The FEV1 is normal. The
FEV1/FVC
  ratio is elevated.
  Flow-Volume Loop: mild restrictive pattern with an early
termination of
  exhalation.
  Lung Volumes: The TLC, FRC and RV are normal. The RV/TLC ratio
is elevated.

  Impression:
  Normal lung volumes with probably normal spirometry. The FVC
may be
  underestimated due to early termination of exhalation. There
are no prior
  studies available for comparison.

Echocardiogram [**2149-2-7**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: elevated right atrial pressure with normal left and
right ventricular contractile function

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 75 y/o F with tacheobronchomalacia s/p stenting, OSA,
who now presents with SOB.
.
# SOB: Based on history, she may have initially presented with
reactive airway disease / asthma exacerbation with no compromise
of her oxygenation. Unfortunately we do not have ABGs. Patient's
lungs were without crackl
