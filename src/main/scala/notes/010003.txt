.
STUDY: CTA of the head with and without contrast.

TECHNIQUE: Following a no contrast head CT, axial multidetector
CT images of
the head were obtained during the intravenous contrast
administration of
nonionic contrast material. Multiplanar two-dimensional
reformatted images
and volume-rendered three-dimensional reformatted images were
obtained.

COMPARISON: Prior CT of the head without contrast dated [**5-5**], [**2124**].

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Again, left temporal and parietal
vasogenic edema and
effacement of the sulci is demonstrated. Areas of high density
likely
consistent with embolization material in a previously known and
reported
vascular malformation.

HEAD CTA: On the left temporal lobe, there is a subtle area of
thin
enhancement, measuring approximately 27.2 x 27.8 mm in size,
vasogenic edema
is demonstrated extending superiorly and producing effacement of
the sulci. No
frank evidence of vascular malformation is identified or
aneurysm. Normal
pattern of enhancement is demonstrated in major arterial
vascular structures.
There is no evidence of significant midline shifting or
deviation of the
normally midline structures. In the multiplanar two-dimensional
and volume-
rendered reformatted images, there is no evidence of vascular
stenosis or
flow-related abnormality, hypoplasia of the A1 segment on the
right is
demonstrated. No aneurysms are identified. The vertebrobasilar
system is
patent with dominance of the left vertebral artery. No vascular
malformation
is identified and the embolization cast is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Persistent vasogenic edema with a faint and subtle
area of thin
ring enhancement identified on the left temporal lobe as
described above,
correlation with MRI and MRA is recommended for further
characterization.
.
INDICATION: DVT, assess for DVT in the bilateral upper
extremities.

COMPARISON: None available.

BILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color
Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 493**] images were obtained that demonstrate wall-to-wall
flow in the
right subclavian with normal response to respiration. There is a
nonocclusive
clot in the left subclavian which does not compress. The left
internal
jugular appears clear and demonstrates compression. There is
nonocclusive clot
in the left axilla, and one of the brachial veins. In the SCV
the clot is
more echogenic and retracted and in the more distal SVC and
axillary vein the
less echogenic material is wall-to-wall.

The right internal jugular, axillary, and both brachial
demonstrate wall-to-
wall flow with normal compression. The right cephalic and
basilic are patent.

IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive, likly subacute DVT of the left
subclavian vein
extending to the axillary and one of the brachial veins.
.
INDICATION: DVT on the left lower extremity, evaluate for one on
the right.

COMPARISON: None available.

PORTABLE RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: The left
common femoral
demonstrates low flow. On the right, there is normal response to
respiration.
The right common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal
veins compress and
show wall-to-wall flow with normal response or augmentation.
Right calf veins
demonstrated.

IMPRESSION: No DVT of the right lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT initially presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] on [**5-4**] with calf
pain and found to have bilateral LE clots, pulmonary saddle
embolus (bilateral) had 2 coil embolizations and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on [**5-4**]. In the ICU the patient remained HD stable
and had good 02 sats on room air. IVC filter placed yesterday
and following CTA head showed no new areas to intervene on.
Patient evaluated by neurosurgery and he was put on dilantin.
Prior to transfer to the floor the patient's dilantin level was
low, he received increased dose.
.
#Pulmonary Embolus/DVT: Per MICU team and neurosurgery, the risk
of anticoagulation given his recent intraparenchymal hemorrhage
outweights the benefit of anticoagulation for PEs.  Patient
continued to sat well on room air. He was found to have a LUE
clot as well but per MICU no plans for SVC filter as clinically
insignificant.
-Hold aspirin, hold heparin SQ, absolutely no anticoagulation
for 1 month.
-f/u outpatient neurosurgery in 4 weeks.
-tylenol for pain.
.
#Recent left parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage:likely [**2-21**]
vascular malformation with dural AVM's and aneurysm reported on
OSH CTA head/MRI. s/p embolization of dural AVM's x2. Dilantin
level low initially, given load in the MICU and now on increased
dose.
-continue dilantin (increased to 200 [**Hospital1 **])
