Chief Complaint:
upper GI bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**10-25**] upper endoscopy
[**10-29**] upper endoscopy
[**11-6**] upper endoscopy
[**11-6**] colonoscopy
[**11-7**] upper endoscopy w/ variceal banding

History of Present Illness:
57 yo F with hx of polysubstance abuse, alcoholic cirrhosis,
active NSAID use, transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**]
for possible angiography and intervention of upper GI bleed.  At
6am on [**10-23**], pt had approximately 1 quart of bloody emesis
associated with weakness. On initial arrival to OSH ED, HR~115,
with systolic 60s to 70s.  She was started on protonix and
octreotide drips at that point with 2L IVF and 4 U pRBC. EGD
done in their ED revealed a large clot with bleeding in the
gastic cardia. No varices were seen & Epinephrine was injected.

.
Summary of transfusion and Hcts:
- [**10-23**]: Hct 25 in ED --> 2L IVF, 4U pRBC --> 36.3
- [**10-24**]: 31 --> 25 --> 4 U pRBC + 2FFP -->31 -->39
- [**10-24**], 9PM: 39 --> 30 --> 2U pRBC + 2-3 units in transport
.
A total of 4.25 L of bloody contents were suctioned from her
stomach after EGD and she had extensive melanotic/bloody BMs.
.
CT of the abdomen showed showed cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis,
ascites and diffuse colonic wall thickening.  There was also a
finding in the LLL concerning for PNA for which she received
amikacin, cefepime, and vancomycin. WBC trended from 16 to 20
prior to transfer. Initial blood gas at OSH showed ph of 7.07 in
setting of ETOH level of 200, corrected fairly rapidly to 7.32.
.
ROS: unable to assess

Pertinent Results:
[**10-25**] EGD: Varices at the gastroesophageal junction and lower
third of the esophagus Congestion and granularity in the whole
stomach compatible with diffuse moderate nonbleeding portal
gastropathy. Blood in the fundus and cardia this obstructed
vision of these areas. The body, antrum, duodenal bulb and D2,
D3 had no bleeding sites. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of
the duodenum

[**10-29**] EGD: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and
gastroesophageal junction Varices at the lower third of the
esophagus and gastroesophageal junction 4-5 mm adherent clot
overlying potential ulcer without active bleeding in fundus.
Clot adherent despite numerous flushes.
Erythema, congestion, mosaic appearance and abnormal vascularity
in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive
gastropathy Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

[**2181-11-7**] EGD:
4 cords of grade II-III varices were seen in the lower third of
the esophagus. The varices were not bleeding. 2 bands were
successfully placed.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 year-old female w/ polysubstance abuse, active alcoholism,
EtOH cirrhosis, previously with UGIB at OSH s/p EGD on admission
showing grades I & II varices and clot overlying peptic ulcer
with BRBPR. Due to prolonged hospital course, discharge summary
is in chronological order:

First MICU Course: ([**Date range (1) 72108**])

GI Bleed: Urgent EGD was done on admission [**10-25**], it showed
grades I & II varices, and clot overlying peptic ulcer but did
not show any actively bleeding varicies. She was suspected to
have a symptomatic ulcer and underwent repeat EGD on [**10-29**] to
evaluate the need for TIPS.  Given insignificant varicies,
hepatology service recommended against TIPS.  A potential
culprit ulcer was found, covered by clot overlying the fundus.
An intervention was not indicated and patient was continued on
PPI and sucralfate.
.
Respiratory failure: OSH chest CT showed bilateral lower lobe
consolidations, possibly from aspiration and patient required
significant ventilatory support.  Patient was started on
Vanc/ceftriaxon on [**10-25**] and brodened to Vanc/Zosyn on [**10-26**].
She was ventilated with low-tidal volume ventilation.  She
completed an 8 day course of antibiotics.  She was extubated on
presodex on [**10-31**] and her oxygen requirement continued to
decrease.
.
Leukocytosis: Patient had a leukocytosis of unclear etiology.
Cultures, paracentesis and C. diff assay were unrevealing.  This
was trending down prior to transfer.

[**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] COURSE: ([**Date range (1) 69839**])

Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] service on [**11-4**]
on 4 L NC oxygen which was quickly weaned to 2 L then to room
air, which she tolerated. Her leukocytosis was thought to be
secondary to an inflammatory process rather than an infectious
one, as her hypoxia improved and she was afebrile. For her
mental status, she was treated for PSE with lactulose and
rifaxamin. Her mental status improved dramatically over her
course on the floor and she was being screened for rehab, having
done well with PT/OT but had a large bloody bowel movement
consisting of fresh red blood and clot on [**11-6**], which caused her
to be readmitted to the ICU for further hemodynamic monitoring.

Second MICU Course: ([**Date range (1) 9395**])

Returned to MICU with BRBPR concerning for fast upper versus
lower GI bleed. HCT was stable. Vital signs were stable.
Regardless, was started on octreotride drip and pantoprazole
drip. Seen by GI for colonoscopy and EGD. Copious blood seen in
colon, but no site of bleeding found. At repeat EGD received
banding of 2 varices. Given prophylactic levofloxacin. Continue
to have altered mental status. Most likely etiology was hepatic
encephalopathy. Held lactulose in context of bl
