CT head [**2192-9-18**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Post-surgical changes from recent right
parietal
craniotomy are noted. There is persistent shift of the usually
midline
structures 4 mm to the left, unchanged compared to prior
examination from
[**2192-9-6**]. A minimal amount of subdural fluid remains,
though
significantly decreased compared to prior. Scalp staples,
subcutaneous air
and a mild amount of pneumocephalus are identified. Stable mild
proportional enlargement of the ventricles and sulci is
consistent with age-related cortical atrophy. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved throughout.  There is no new
hemorrhage or evidence of acute large territorial infarction.
Incidental note is made of a cavum septum pellucidum et vergae.
Minimal
mucosal thickening is identified within the left sphenoid sinus.
The
remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION:
1. Post-surgical changes from recent right parietal craniotomy.
2. Stable minimal subfalcine herniation.
3. No new hemorrhage or acute large territorial infarction.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2192-9-20**] 4:02 PM

Faint left perihilar opacity could represent aspiration.
Followup examination recommended.



Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted through the same day surgery department for
elective evacuation of right sided subdural hematoma.  The pt
underwent the procedure without complication. Her post operative
imaging was stable.  She was kept in the ICU overnight for close
observation and remained stable.

on [**2192-9-19**] The patient was transferred to the floor.  She
developed a low grade fever to 100.5 on the evening of [**9-19**].

On [**9-20**], The patient continued to have low grade fevers to 100.5.
 A ordered UA was ordered and was negative.  A CXR was
consistent with faint left perihilar opacity could represent
aspiration. When the patient was attempting to get out of bed to
the chair with physical therapy the patient began desating to
the low 90s.  The surgical incision was noted to be slightly
erythematous and warm on palpation.

On [**9-21**],Overnight the patient was noted to have low urine output
of 75cc over 8 hours.  The patient was started on NS at 60cc/hr.
 By morning the patient had an additional 50 cc of urine and a
250cc NS IV bolus was given for hydration. Both serum potassium
and magnesium level were low and the patient was given IV
repleation.  The patient's fever was 101.2 overnight despite
tylenol, lethargic on exam and lung sounds were diminished at
the bases.  The patient continues with decreased mobility and
poor effort with the incentive spirometry.  Levaquin was
empiracally initiated for possible aspiration pneumonia.Blood
Cultures were ordered***. The oxycodone was discontinued due to
ongoing lethargy.  Nursing voiced conscern of whether the
patient was possible aspirating and a speech swallow consult was
placed. A Geriatrics consult was requested for assistance with
management of fluid volume status, low urine output, possible
aspiration pneumonia, ongoing fevers, and lethargy.

On [**9-22**], A repeat CXR was consistent with ****
