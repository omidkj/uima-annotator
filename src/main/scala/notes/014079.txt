Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transfusion of packed red blood cells
Upper endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year old male with history of atrial
fibrillation (on coumadin), coronary artery disease, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and diverticulosis who presented
with chest discofort and was found to have a gastrointestinal
bleed. In brief, the patient presented to the ED on [**10-17**] with
right-sided, typical chest pain. The pain was exacerbated by
exertion, but he did not have any associated heart failure
symptoms. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] any nausea, diaphoresis, melena or
hematochezia. In the ED, he was found to have melena with a Hct
of 21. There, he had a positive NG lavage, and ischemic changes
were noted on his EKG in the inferior and lateral leads.
Cardiology saw the patient and recommended aspirin.
.
Due to his bleeding and INR of 2.5, he was given 2 U prbc, 2 U
FFP, and 10 mg SC Vitamin K, and he was admitted to the ICU.
After receiving blood, he had resolution of ECG changes. In the
ICU, he was placed on a PPI and his hematocrit remained stable
overnight. He had an EGD performed on [**10-18**] that showed healing
duodenal ulcer with no sign of recent bleeding. After this
finding, GI recommended only PPI [**Hospital1 **] for one month then lifelong
PPI should he need to remain on his aspirin. Over the course of
[**2180-10-17**], he required a total of 5U PRBC's to maintain Hct > 28.
After his reassuring EGD and stabilization of his hematocrit, he
was transferred to the floor.
.
On my interview, the patient denies any chest pain, respiratory
difficulty, abdominal pain, further dark stools, nausea or
vomiting, or any other concerns. In fact, he says he fells quite
well. His daughter reports to me that he is reluctant to
complain of any symptoms.

Pertinent Results:
Labs on admission: WBC 10 (85% neutrophils, 10% lymphs, 4%
monos), Hgb 6.7, Hct 20.8, Plt 212,000
BMP remarkable for glucose 168, BUN 98, creatinine 1.7,
potassium 5.2

EGD ([**10-18**]): Erosion in the antrum compatible with non-steroidal
induced gastritis. Healing ulcer in the posterior bulb. Mucosa
suggestive of Barrett's esophagus. Otherwise normal EGD to
second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: PPI [**Hospital1 **] for one month. Discuss with cardiology
if need for both aspirin & warfarin; if needs aspirin will
require life-long PPI. Consider follow-up EGD & colonoscopy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year old gentleman who presented with chest
pain and likely demand ischemia in the setting of a hematocrit
of 21 due to gastrointestinal bleeding, now with stable
hematocrit and free of chest pain after transfusions.
.
# Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's EGD showed healing
ulcers and changes consistent with gastritis. His hematocrit did
stabilize, and the gastroenterology team did not feel that a
colonoscopy was necessary at this time. He had a colonoscopy in
[**2169**] which showed diverticulosis as well as a single polyp. The
patient was instructed to speak with his primary care physician
regarding [**Name Initial (PRE) **] repeat EGD (due to concern for Barrett's) and
potentially a colonoscopy within the next 2-3 months. The
patient should remain on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI for one month; after that,
because he is to stay on his aspirin, he should continue on a
once daily PPI for life.
.
Due to his low risk for rebleeding, the gastroenterology team
felt comfortable with Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9533**] both his aspirin and
coumadin. He is to follow up with his PCP later this week. A
hematocrit should be checked at that time to ensure that he is
maintaining a hematocrit of 28-29 as he did in the hospital. He
did receive a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells as
mentioned above. Our goal for transfusion was hematocrit greater
than 28. The patient will also have VNA services at home. The
VNA should further instruct the patient regarding signs and
symptoms of further bleeding. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was discharged with a new
prescription for ferrous gluconate to take daily at the
recommendation of the GI team. At the time of discharge, the
patient was hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and comfortable on
room air.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient is well rate controlled
naturally, with his usual pulse in the 50s range. He did have
some bradycardia to the high 30s while sleeping. This was
asymptomatic. He was instructed to resume his usual coumadin
regimen upon discharge with repeat INR due at the end of this
week when he sees his PCP.
.
# CHF and CAD: On the day after arrival on the floor, the
patient's home regimen of ACEi, nitrate, and lasix were
restarted. The patient remained chest pain free. It is likely
that Mr. [**Known lastname **] has fixed coronary lesions with demand ischemia
which manifested itself when his hematocrit was so low. He was
instructed to continue on his aspirin with PPI for life ([**Hospital1 **] for
one month then once daily).
.
# COPD: The patient does not have any wheezing on exam. He is
not on any outpatient medications so this history should be
clarified.
.
# Fever: The patient did have low grade fevers on transfer to
the floor without an elevated white blood count. He does have
some [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a chest x-ray was checked to ensure that he did
not aspirate during his EGD. His chest x-ray is unchanged from
last month with a vague lingular opacity but no other
significant findings. A urinarlysis was also sent which was
negative. At the time of discharge, his temperature was 98.4. It
is pos
