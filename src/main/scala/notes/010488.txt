History of Present Illness:
44 y/o female with multiple medical problems, including morbid
obesity, lymphedema, and recurrent cellulitis in left lower
extremity (followed closely by infectious disease), who p/w
fever to 101.2 and chills for the past few days.
.
Of note, she had recent hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 11645**] for left
lower extremity cellulitis, for which she was treated with IV
vancomycin and miconazole cream. No specific pathogen was found,
but she did clinically improve. She subsequently completed
moxifloxacin therapy and then resumed [**Hospital1 **] Clindamycin for
suppressive therapy. She started to go to a lymphedema clinic at
the [**Hospital1 756**], but has lately stopped going.  She has a 10+ year
history of worsening lymphedema peppered with multiple episodes
of cellulitis, typically responsive to vancomycin.  She is on
chronic suppressive therapy with clindamycin which she attests
to taking regularly, and will undergo about a week of
moxifloxacin therapy when she feels typical cellulitic symptoms
like worsening lower extremity pain, swelling, fevers, chills,
and fatigue.
.
Of late, she reports "raging fever and chills" despite taking 3
rounds of her avelox and has not been feeling better. Reports
her thighs and knees are red and swollen. She has had continued
and issues with cellulitis of her chronic lymphedema. She states
this feels like when she has problems eating. She feels short of
breath which she says happens when she has fevers related to her
cellulitis. Requested a "visitng nurse to just come in and give
a dose of      vancomycin."
.
ROS also notable for increased SOB and SOB with exertion. C/O
weakness and lethargy.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 99.8, 114, 135/62, 16, 99%. Pt was
tachypneic, hypoxic with a RA SAO2 of 85% and diaphoretic. With
neb tx pt's breathing became more comfortable but she remained
hypoxic on RA and required NRB to maintain a Sat of >92%.
Labs notable for WBC 23.1 with left shift, Hct 32.6, Cr 1.1,
lactate 1.1, U/A wnl. CXR difficult to see lung bases given body
habitus could be pleural effusion vs penetration issues from
size.  Patient was given albuterol, ipratropium, vancomycin,
levofloxacin. Vitals on transfer - 97% nrb, 129/80
access - 20G
.
On the unit,  her initial VS were 161/59, 116, 100% NRB.  Her
sats oscillate between 80-100% on room air, as she falls asleep
mid sentence.  She is fully aware, appropriate, and answers
questions when awake.  She has felt poorly for about 4 days with
what she suspects to be cellulitis.  Her breathing has been
difficult for about 4 weeks, dominated by chest tightness,
cough, and occasional wheeze.  Effective treatment with
bronchodilation.

2. Asthma (since childhood)
3. HTN
4. Recurrent cellulitis in left lower extremity
5. Osteoarthritis
6. Recurrent otitis media

8. Obstructive sleep apnea (on home CPAP)
9. hiatal hernia

obese
2. Father passed away at 69 due to HTN, OSA, and MI
3. Brother, 40, who is morbidly obese and has lymphedema
