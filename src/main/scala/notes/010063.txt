Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 55-year-old
female who had a history of chest pain and shortness of
breath and lightheadedness with exertion over the past five
weeks.  She has also been complaining of increasing fatigue.
The patient underwent an exercise treadmill test which showed
an ejection fraction of 57% with moderate apical ischemia.
She had cardiac catheterization on [**2110-5-23**] which showed
pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 30 and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of
30, ejection fraction of 58%, 4+ aortic regurgitation, 20%
left main lesion.  The patient was referred to Cardiac
Surgery for replacement of her aortic valve.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortic valvular disease.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Status post left knee surgery.
5.  Status post cholecystectomy.
6.  Diabetes mellitus, diet-controlled.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lescol XL 80 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Lipitor and shell fish.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 20 pack year smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Stable.
HEENT:  NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI.  Neck:  Supple.  No
lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids:  2+ bilaterally
with audible murmur radiating to the neck.  Lungs:  Clear
anteriorly and posteriorly.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm without rub, loud systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender, without masses, or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis
or edema.  The pulses were equal bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2110-6-5**] for
surgery.  The patient was taken to the Operating Room for an
aortic valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 17167**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical
valve.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Please see
the operative note for further details.

In the Operating Room, the patient was noted to have an
ejection fraction of greater than 55%.  The patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
Shortly after arriving in the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient became hypotensive and unresponsive to volume
resuscitation or boluses of epinephrine.  The patient
developed PEA and chest compressions were begun.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was at the bedside.  Shortly after the patient was in full
arrest.  The decision was made to reopen the patient's chest
at the bedside.  Prior to doing so, a transesophageal
echocardiogram was obtained which showed no aortic
dissection.

The chest was opened by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7625**], and
internal cardiac massage was begun.  The decision was made to
take the patient back to the Operating Room.  In the
Operating Room, the patient was put back on bypass and an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  The mediastinum was
explored.  No evidence of tamponade or bleeding was found.
No evidence of aortic dissection.  The patient was
resuscitated in the Operating Room and was weaned from the
peripulmonary bypass machine successfully and again
transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition.

The patient had early chest tube output her first
postoperative night requiring reversal of her coagulopathy
with blood products.  In the early morning of postoperative
day number one, the patient had multiple runs of nonsustained
VT and was started on Amiodarone.  After the Amiodarone was
started, the ventricular tachycardia decreased.  The patient
was on Milrinone for inotropic support which was weaned to
off on postoperative day number one.  The patient's
intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned down.  By the evening of
postoperative day number one, the patient's hemodynamics had
decreased and the intra-aortic balloon pump wean was
discontinued.

The patient had been weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation which she tolerated well.  On the night of
postoperative day number one, the patient's hemodynamics
again decreased and the milrinone was restated.  On
postoperative day number two, the intra-aortic balloon pump
was removed successfully.  The patient tolerated this well.
It should be noted that the patient had awoken immediately
postoperatively without any neurological deficits, moved all
extremities equally, and was neurologically intact.

On postoperative day number two, the patient's milrinone was
again weaned down.  The patient began receiving Lasix for
diuresis as the patient's chest x-ray on physical examination
showed that she had volume overload.  By postoperative day
number three, the milrinone was weaned to off.  The patient
had been on Levophed for maintenance of blood pressure that
was weaned to off.  The patient had been paced through the
epicardial pacing wires, A paced, for improvement of her
cardiac index.  The patient had been tolerating diuresis.

On postoperative day number four, the patient was started on
Coumadin for anticoagulation.  The patient's pacing wires
were removed without difficulty on postoperative day number
five.  The patient's pressors had been weaned to off.

On postoperative day number five, the patient was transferred
from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular floor.  The
patient began walking with Physical Therapy.  Anticoagulation
with heparin was started and by postoperative day number six,
the patient had completed a level V walking 500 feet and
climbing one flight of stairs with Physical Therapy, and was
cleared from a clinical standpoint to go home.  The patient
was not adequately anticoagulated on Coumadin yet.

By postoperative day number eight, the patient's INR had
reached 2.0 and she was cleared for discharge to home.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  T maximum
98.3, pulse 66, in sinus rhythm, blood pressure 122/47,
respiratory rate 16, saturation on room air 96%.
Neurologically, the patient is awake, alert, oriented times
three.  The neurological examination was nonfocal.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, positive click, no
murmur.  respiratory:  Lungs were clear bilaterally
anteriorly and posteriorly.  GI:  The abdomen was obese,
positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended,
tolerating a regular diet.  Extremities:  There was 2+
pitting edema, warm, good distal pulses.  Sternal incision:
Staples are intact.  There was a minimal amount of drainage
at the distal portion of the incision.  There was no
erythema.  The sternum was stable.
