Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, referred from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p CABGx4(LIMA->LAD, SVG->PDA, OM, Ramus)/AVR(23mm CE Perimount
bioprosthesis) [**2105-6-19**]


History of Present Illness:
This 66-year-old man with COPD, PVD who was admitted to OSH on
[**6-6**] in respiratory failure. He was intubated and admitted to
the ICU. His initial blood gas was 7.06/94/134/26 (on 100% O2).
Chest xray showed pulmonary edema. Initial EKG (not included in
transfer records) was read as sinus tachycardia at 120, LVH with
repolarization. Initial TnI 0.11 and peaked at 0.21. BNP was
874. He was treated with nebs, diuretics, antibiotics and was
extubated on [**2105-6-7**]. He was transferred to telemetry where he
has been pain free. He was stressed yesterday and found to have
an EF of 20-25% with a fixed defect. Patient has been on RA w/
sats >95%. He was OOB with no complaints prior to transfer.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he states that his shortness of breath
started approximately 4-5 days prior to his presentation. He
states that the shortness of breath was sudden onset ~1am and
progressively got worse. He states that he started taking
Avandia 4 days prior to his symptom onset. He denies chest pain,
jaw pain, or arm pain. He had a cough during this time but
denies any sputum production. Also, he has had no fevers,
chills, or sweats. The shortness of breath was no positional. He
has had intermittent leg swelling over the past few weeks but
not progressively so. He does have chronic pain in his calves
when walking <1 block; the pain is relieved with rest.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Pneumothorax, After removal of chest tubes.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old man with s/p AVR/CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Pneumothorax, After removal of chest tubes.
HISTORY: Status post AVR, CABG, assess for pneumothorax, status
post removal of chest tubes.

chest, 1 vw

Compared with [**2105-6-19**], the ET tube, NG tube, left chest tube and
question mediastinal drains have been removed. Swan-Ganz
catheter remains present, tip overlying theright pulmonary
artery. No pneumothorax or gross effusion is identified. No CHF
is seen.

There is patchy increased retrocardiac density, increased
compared with [**2105-6-19**], consistent with development of left lower
lobe collapse and/or consolidation.

Mildly dilated descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta. Complex

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) AR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic
dysfunction with moderated HK of basal segments and severe HK of
mid and
distal segments.. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in
the ascending aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
