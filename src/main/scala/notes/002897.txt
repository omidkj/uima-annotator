Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfur / Loperamide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF, COPD, NSTEMI, GI Bleed while anti-coagulated for NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ COPD, CRI, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia
who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2128-12-30**] with COPD
exacerbation; her hospital course was complicated by an NSTEMI
on [**1-2**] which was treated medically with heparin gtt, ASA and
plavix - she now has had BRBPR, melenotic stool and report of
black vomit for several hours.
.
The patient initially presented with SOB and LE edema similar to
two other COPD flares she has had over the last two months.
During both admissions she was found to have EKG changes but
negative cardiac enzymes. Recent clinic notes document increaing
dyspnea despite diuresis, and increased use of supplemental O2
(at first only used intermittently, then usuing it all day) with
persistent SOB despite O2 sats in the upper 90's. She was sent
to ED by her PCP.
.
In the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG showed TWI in avl, V5, V6 and slight STE in
V1-V3, all stable from previous. Overall stable EKG from [**11-29**].
BNP was > 15,000 (12,000 in [**10-30**],000 in [**11-30**]). She was
admitted for COPD exacerbation and being treated with nebs,
diuresis, O2. She initially had elevated troponin with flat CK
and CKMB; the troponin (0.09-0.2) was thought to be [**12-25**] renal
failure.
.
On [**1-2**] patient triggered with episode of chest pain, found to
have elevated CK (peak 86), MBIndex (16) and Troponin (2.08) but
no new changes on EKG. She was seen by cardiology and placed on
heparin gtt, ASA 325, plavix 600mg as well as beta blocker,
continued on lipitor 80mg for medical treatment of NSTEMI. TTE
([**1-3**], full report below) showed EF >60%, mod LVH, Increased
PCWP, 1+MR, 1+TR, mod APH, sma pericardial effusion.
.
On [**1-4**] patient's heparin was discontinued for PTT 149, she was
also orthostatic so lasix, imdur, b-blocker were also held. In
the afternoon/evening she had three episodes of BRPBR as well as
large melanic stool. Later on the patient's daughter reported an
episode of black colored emesis, she later vomited food
material. VS were: SBPs in the low 100's, HR in 80's (beta
blocked) with O2 sat low 90's on 3-4L nc. Her HCT dropped from
28 on am labs -> 24; received 1L fluids on floor. Multiple
attempts at NGT and OGT were unsuccessful, and IV access was
tenuous, prompting admission to ICU.
.
GI fellow was consulted - Patient received 2 units of PRBCs and
1 unit of FFP.  Her HCT has been stable in MICU.  Her vitals
were stable as well.  Received lasix IV volume overload after
PRBCs.  CT abdomen was suspicous for ischemic colitis in [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
region, and tagged red cell scan was negative.  Patient and
family has refused surgery.  Empirically started treating with
vanc/levo/flagyl.  She was started on Clear diet and is
tolerating it.
.
On transfer to the floor patient denies chestpain, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, headache, change in
vision/hearing, weakness.  States that she felt slight SOB
during trasportation.  Otherwise feels 'fine'.

.
ECHO ([**1-3**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.4 L/min/m2).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. In the
absence of a prominent history of systemic hypertension, an
infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid, etc.) should be considered.

.
CXR ([**1-2**]): Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Small bilateral
pleural effusions greater on the left have mildly increased.
There has been also mild interval increase in left lower
retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis. There is no overt CHF
or pneumothorax. Surgical clips are noted in the neck. Patient
post right mastectomy.
.
GI BLEEDING STUDY [**2129-1-5**]: No evidence of active GI bleeding.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2129-1-5**]:
1.  Circumferential thickening of the descending colon extending
from the splenic flexure to the descending/sigmoid colon
junction, indicating colitis. The differential diagnosis
includes ischemia, especially given the degree of calcified
atherosclerotic plaque in the abdominal aorta, as well as
infectious and other inflammatory causes.  The mesenteric
vasculature cannot be assessed on this non-contrast exam.  There
are small amounts of fluid in the left
paracolic gutter, but no pneumatosis or free air at this time.
2.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and small-to-moderate
pericardial effusion are not significantly changed since [**Month (only)
