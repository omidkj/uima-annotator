Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented [**2152-1-3**] for her opertation which was a
cystectomy and creation of ileal loop. The patient tolerated the
procedure well. She was taken to the intensive care unit
intubated under stable conditions with an NGT and JP drains and
was on Levaquin. On POD1 the patient was extubated. On POD3 she
was transferred out of the ICU. On POD 4 her NGT was
discontinued. On POD6 her diet was advanced to clears and her R
stent was taken out. On POD7 the patient started complaining of
increased abdominal pain. On POD8 the patient had a persisent
left lower lobe consolidation despite treatemtn with Levaquin.
ID was consulted. The patient was aslo placed on Levofloxacin/
Vancomycin and Flagyl per ID recomendation. On POD9 a CT scan
was obtained. The results were: 1. Status post cystectomy with
ileal conduit. There is extravasation of contrast at the left
ureteral anastomosis with contrast layering in a large pelvic
fluid collection. There is an additional fluid collection
posterior to this which does not have contrast within it. These
collections are likely an urinoma. Given the patient's clinical
history of leukocytosis and fever, infection of the fluid cannot
be excluded. Drainage could be performed via CT guidance and a
posterior approach, though it would be technically difficult..
2. Persistent bilateral hydronephrosis.
3. Moderate left-sided pleural effusion and smaller right-sided
pleural effusion.
4. Fluid in the peritoneal cavity and subcutaneous tissues.
A left percutaneous nephroureteral stent  was placed by IR and
she had CT guided drainage of her pelvic urinoma with a pigtail
catheter placement.
A loopogram was obtained which suggested a right ureteroleal
anastamotic leak. A percutaneous nephroureteral stent was placed
by IR. A PICC line was also placed and TPN was started. The
patient then began to progress well. Her WBC count decreased and
stabilized and she started to tolerate more PO intake. Her JP
drains were discontinued. Before her discharge a final CT scan
was obtained. Ther results were:1. Marked reduction in size of
pelvic fluid collection (urinoma) with pigtail catheter in
place.
2. Bilateral percutaneous nephroureteral stents in place, with
the right stent terminating in the ileal conduit and left stent
terminating in the distal ileostomy.
3. Bowel loops are unremarkable and there is no evidence of
abscess.
4. Decrease in the amount of ascites with small residual
collection in left lower quadrant. Diffuse anasarca remains.
5. Decreased size of moderate left-sided pleural effusion with
resolution of right-sided pleural effusion
A pigtail creatinine was obtained which
