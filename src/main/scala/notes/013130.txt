shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2124-8-21**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 17009**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue MVR/ septal myomectomy


History of Present Illness:
72 year old female with history of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with resting LVOT obstruction who
has
had worsening of her baseline dyspnea over the past three four
days. She also presents because she felt somewhat presyncopal at
home. Of note, she was recently seen in the ED with dyspnea on
[**2124-5-4**]; at that time she was seen by the electrophysiology
service, who felt that she was in sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block
at a rate of 50. Her PR interval at that time was 400
milliseconds, with a normal QRS, and her conduction improved to
3:2 Wenckebach with exercise. She was told to cease her
Atenolol,
and had only recently been instructed to take it again tonight
at
lower dose of 25 mg (from 75 mg), which she did. She has had she
says six episodes over the past two years of dyspnea that were
worse than the current episode. Typically, she notices the
worsened dyspnea when she is climbing stairs and typically has a
heaviness in her chest, which is not present during the current
episode. A TEE was done and he was found to have 3+ mitral
regurgitation and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for
mitral valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2124-8-21**] Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated and elongated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is
asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. There is a severe resting
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal, but leaflet excursion
is limited,possibly due to turbulent flow in LVOT. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with trivial mitral stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect).

Post Bypass: Patient is AV paced on phenylepherine infusion. A
tissue valve (#25 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] per surgeons) is seen in the mitral
position. The new valve appears well seated without perivalvular
leaks and good leaflet motion on 2D and 3D exam. Peak mitral
gradient 8mm Hg, Mean 5 mm Hg. The LVOT has less turbulent flow
with gradients of 4 mm Hg peak and 2 mm Hg mean. The Aortic
valve gradients are peak [**10-19**] and mean 5 mm Hg. Aortic contours
intact. LVEF >55%. Remaining exam is unchanged, all findings
discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2124-8-21**] where
she underwent a mitral valve replacement, septal myomectomy.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
but was not on coumadin prior to surgery due to hypersentivity
to coumadin per patient and history of epitaxis. She was started
on coumadin 3mg once post-operatively and after one dose of
coumadin her INR increased from normal to 6.8. It decreased to
1.6 with vitamin K.  Her cardiologist Dr.[**Name (NI) 3733**] was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and it was decided that coumadin would be discontinued
due to her sensitivity to coumadin and history of epitaxis
requiring cauterization, heavy menstruation, and prolonged
bleeding from trauma. The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on post-operative day four the patient
continued to be deconditioned, required frequent reminders to
maintain sternal precautions and rehab was recommended. The
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to [**Location (un) 169**] in [**Location (un) 55**] in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
