FINDINGS: Doppler evaluation shows triphasic waveforms at the
femoral levels
bilaterally; all other waveforms are monophasic. ABI evaluation
is inaccurate
due to vessel noncompressibility. Pulse volume recordings
demonstrate diffuse
waveform widening bilaterally and symmetrically.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral SFA and likely tibial disease. This is
unchanged
compared to the exam done approximately one week earlier.

LEFT FOOT, THREE VIEWS:

There is severe diffuse osteopenia and dense vascular
calcification. There is
flexion of multiple digits. This limits assessment of the IP
joints and
distal and middle phalanges. However, I doubt the presence of
fracture or
dislocation involving the second digit. No focal lytic or
sclerotic lesion is
seen. No radiopaque foreign body is identified. The lateral was
obtained
non-standing but suggests of an accentuated arch (pes cavus),
though this may
be positional.

IMPRESSION: Severe osteopenia. No fracture or focal bone
destruction
involving the second digit.

 INDICATION: 70 y/o woman with CHF, sepsis, hypoxic respiratory
failure. New
chest pain.

TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest radiograph. Comparison is made to
the previous
chest radiograph dated [**9-25**].

FINDINGS: The tip of the right subclavian IV line is in SVC.
There is no
pneumothorax.

The heart is mildly enlarged. There is bilateral increased
interstitial
markings, with blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angle,
representing
pulmonary edema and pleural effusion. Underlying pneumonia in
the right lung
base cannot be excluded. The overall appearance of the lungs
have slightly
improved compared to the previous study.

IMPRESSION: Slightly improved cardiac failure with bilateral
pleural
effusions. Underlying pneumonia in the right lung base cannot be
excluded.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 y/o female with multiple medical problems including recent
MRSA Aortic valve endocarditis (tx w/vanco [**Date range (1) 105493**]),
Pseudomonal bacteremia [**8-9**], and C-diff presented with severe
sepsis and admitted to MICU.  She was intubated, received
aggressive fluids and antibiotics (flagyl/vanco/gent/levo).
   MICU course:  intubation overnight.  She then became more
alert, following commands, and was extubated the next day.
Antibiotic coverage for presumed sepsis (?source- RLE lesion). A
surgical consult for her right lower extremity lesion was called
and her wound was debrided and dressed. She remained in A fib on
telemetry with HR ranging from 107-130s.  Her INR was noted to
be 7 on the day of transfer and she was given Vit K and FFP in
the AM with a resultant INR of 2.6 and 2.9.  Coumadin held on
starting day prior to transfer for possible bleed (HCT 21
requiring transfusion) and elevated INR.  Hypoxia thought to be
related to CHF after aggressive fluid loads for sepsis,
diuresing on Lasix.

   Floor course:  She was febrile 102.3 on transfer and heart
rate was 140's in AFIB.  Over the next few days, her femoral
line was pulled and cultured and she remained afebrile
afterwards for rest of admission. Right lower extremeity swab
culture and femoral line tip culture both grew Pseudomonis and
she was started on Aztreonam.  Her atrial fibrillation was
well-controlled on Lopressor 75 mg QID and she was
anticoagulated.  She had also been having severe diarrhea and
was empirically treated for C. Diff with Flagyl despite being
negative for stool toxin, and the diarrhea resolved.
    She has known decompensated diastolic HF chronically with
underlying stuctural lung disease requiring home O2.  Her CHF
was exacerbated by the sepsis and she was initially >40 lbs
over dry wt.   She tolerated diuresis well, averaging neg. [**3-10**]
liters a day and her respiratory status returned to baseline.
    She developed toe pain which developed into b/l leg pain.
Podiatry was consulted.  LE arterial studies showed vascular
compromise.  She was scheduled for out pt follow up.  RLE
cellulitis was surgically debrided and dressings changes daily
with recommended follow up in [**3-10**] weeks with vascular surgery.
