THIS DICTATION WILL COVER THE [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL COURSE FROM
[**3-12**] THROUGH [**3-31**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was intubated during
the early part of this hospital course and maintained on
assist control.  She was then changed to pressure control
secondary to high airway pressures and a rapid respiratory
rate which she appeared to tolerate more.  The patient was
trached by the Cardiothoracic Surgery Team on [**3-21**] in
the Operating Room.  This was complicated by a tracheotomy
which was too big for her and was preferentially ventilating
the left lung, having carbon dioxide retention.  With a
dressing placed externally the tracheotomy was in improved
position, however, there was a persistent cuff leak around
the tracheotomy.  The tracheotomy is scheduled at this time
to be changed on [**4-2**] by the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Team for a smaller size.

Secondary to the patient's severe interstitial pulmonary
fibrosis, she remained on a good deal of ventilatory support.
She was switched on [**3-31**] from pressure control to assist
control and appeared to tolerate it better, however, it was
unclear at the time of this discharge summary if the patient
would ever be able to be weaned from the ventilator.  The
patient was also tried on a Passy-Muir valve to see if she
was able to speak with her family as the thought was that she
was not improving; however, this failed.

2.  NEUROLOGIC / VASCULAR:  The patient had developed a left
arteriovenous fistula in [**Month (only) 404**] as a complication of a left
IJ procedure.  This was coiled on [**3-15**], by Interventional
Neurology Service.  There was no complication to this
procedure.  The patient did not acutely wake up after the
procedure secondary to anesthesia.  A STAT MRI was obtained
and showed no new abnormality.  The patient was continued on
her aspirin and Plavix.  In addition, it had been determined
that the patient had a significant amount of left carotid
stenosis (90%).  The plan was for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] of Neurosurgery
to stent this but after communicating with the family that
the patient was not likely to improve and further procedure
might set her back even more, it was decided that any new
interventions that required major procedures would be
cancelled in favor of preserving the patient's comfort and
dignity.

3.  FEVERS / INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient continued to
have intermittent fevers and a low grade leukocytosis during
this entire period of her hospital course.  The patient had
grown Gram negative rods, E. cloacae, in her sputum.
Initially this was sensitive to Cefepime and Meropenem and
she was double covered with these antibiotics.  Subsequently,
it was discovered that these Gram negative rods had become
resistant to Meropenem.  This was determined on the 9th and
at that time the patient was started on Imipenem and it was
sensitive.  However, after the patient's coiling procedure,
it was decided that as the patient was persistently febrile
with a persistent leukocytosis and her vent settings were not
changed and it did not appear that she had a new pneumonia,
it was decided that these Gram negative rods were colonizer
and would not be treated.

The patient did continue to grow these Gram negative rods in
her sputum after the antibiotics were discontinued.  All
antibiotics were discontinued after her tracheotomy procedure
on [**3-21**]; no further antibiotics were used to treat the
slight intermittent low grade temperatures.

The Infectious Disease Service was following.  An abdominal
CT scan was obtained to rule out an intra-abdominal process;
this was negative.  The Infectious Disease Service
recommended getting imaging of her right hip where she had
had a recent open reduction and internal fixation but
secondary to the hardware, an MRI was not going to be useful.
No further imaging was sought because at the time that the
patient continued to have fevers, it was decided again that
these fevers would not be aggressively pursued secondary to
the patient's non-improving status.

Additionally, the patient had two positive blood cultures,
one with coagulation negative Staphylococcus and one with
Diphtheroid.  These both grew from her A-line and this was
subsequently discontinued, however, they were thought to be a
contaminant.

4.  Takayasu's arteritis:  The patient was continued on her
Prednisone and CellCept during this hospital course.

5.  SEIZURE DISORDER:  The patient was again continued on her
Keppra.  She had no seizure activity.

6.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was continued on her Synthroid
for her hypothyroidism and her insulin and Glargine for
diabetes mellitus.

7.  ANEMIA:  The patient has anemia of chronic disease and
her hematocrit slowly dropped.  Stools were always guaiac
negative.  The patient received a few transfusions, mostly
after the procedures which she underwent, including the
tracheotomy and interventional procedure.

8.  HIP FRACTURE:  The patient has never gotten out of bed
after her open reduction and internal fixation but secondary
to her debilitated state, was unable to undergo Physical
Therapy.  She was continued on subcutaneous heparin for deep
venous thrombosis prophylaxis and will need Physical Therapy
in the future.

9.  PERSISTENT TACHYCARDIA / WITHDRAWAL:  The patient is
narcotic dependent and was also on Ativan.  The patient was
persistently tachycardic during this hospital period to the
130s and 140s and this would worsen with agitation.  This was
thought to be secondary to fevers and also to withdrawal as
the patient's heart rate would improve with Dilaudid.  The
patient's Dilaudid interval was decreased to q. four hours
and the patient was started on a long acting benzodiazepine,
Valium, as opposed to her ativan.  This did improve the
patient's heart rate.

In addition, the patient was ruled out for any cardiac
ischemia several times.

At the time of discharge, the patient's heart rate had
improved to the 80s to 100s.  The patient was on a stable
pain regimen.

10. DISPOSITION:  The patient could likely be screened for
rehabilitation.  While the patient was previously full code,
she was made "DO NOT RESUSCITATE" in the last week of this
hospital period and plan was to pursue comfort and dignity as
opposed to aggressive work-up and treatment of her medical
problems; however, COMFORT MEASURES ONLY status had not been
confirmed by the family and Medical Intensive Care Unit team.

1.  Dilaudid 4 p.o. q. four.
