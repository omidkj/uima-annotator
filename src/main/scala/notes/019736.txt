HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old man with
type 2 diabetes, history of high cholesterol and a recent
admission in [**Month (only) 359**] for DKA, who was brought to the
Emergency Room after being found by landlord (patient has no
family and minimal social support).  Per patient, he
are unclear.  The patient states there was no loss of
consciousness but he was found lethargic, somewhat obtunded,
did not take pills or insulin for the last 36 hours before
admission.  The patient was brought to the Emergency Room.
Initially white count 12, 89% polys, anion gap of 21.  New
acute renal failure with creatinine of 6.4.  ABG equalled
7.25, 32 and 70, CK 9,419, MB 81, troponin negative.
acetone.  A Foley was placed with urine output of 900 cc.
The initial blood sugar was 309.  The patient was started on
insulin drip.  Overnight the patient continued to have anion
gap acidosis with decreasing blood sugar.  Large amount of
acetone in serum as well.  The patient received 7 liters of
normal saline with 3 liters of output.  The patient was
hypertensive and tachycardic on admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes mellitus and secondary
neuropathy, history of DKA in [**2125-10-2**], high cholesterol,
hypertension, chronic low back pain, depression, atypical
chest pain status post t mibi in [**10-3**] which showed an EF of
55% and normal perfusion.  Question of rheumatic fever.
Neurogenic bladder.

MEDICATIONS:  Glucophage 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] , Propranolol 40 mg [**Hospital1 **],
NPH 30 units q h.s., Regular insulin sliding scale, Paxil 60
mg q d, Gemfibrozil 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Percocet [**1-3**] q 4-6 hours
prn.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Sulfa, Erythromycin and iodine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.7, pulse 120, blood
pressure 164/100, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 95% on
room air.  In general, the patient was awake, alert and
oriented to person, place and time but waxes and wanes per
staff.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light,
mucus membranes dry, oropharynx clear.  Neck, JVP at 8 cm,
right IJ catheter in place.  Heart, tachycardic, normal S1
and S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the lower sternal border.
Lungs, scattered crackles, decreased breath sounds in the
left lower lobe.  Abdomen, obese, nontender, nondistended,
normal active bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities, mild bilateral lower extremity edema.  Neuro,
mild asterixis.  Motor [**5-6**] bilaterally in all extremities.
Reflexes brisk knee jerk.

LABORATORY DATA:  Revealed on discharge a hematocrit of 31.5,
white count of 7.7, platelet count 451,000, INR 1.0, PT 12.4,
PTT 21.3, creatinine 1.3 on discharge, however, it had peaked
at 6.6 and progressively decreased.  BUN 25 on discharge.
Potassium 3.9.  The last CK was 851, downtrending from the
9,419.  GGT 13, calcium 8.2, phosphorus 2.5, magnesium 1.5
but repleted, TSH 0.12, free T4 0.8, T3 pending.  Hep surface
antigen negative.  Hep surface antibody positive.  Hepatitis
A antibody positive.  Hep C antibody negative.  Blood
cultures showed no growth.  Urine culture contaminated.  CT
on admission showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage
and chest x-ray on admission showed left lower lobe
consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  A renal ultrasound on
[**2125-12-15**] showed hydronephrosis of the right kidney but a
follow-up renal ultrasound on [**2125-12-18**] showed no evidence of
hydronephrosis in either kidney and a simple cyst in the
right kidney.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was treated in the MICU for DKA
and as the anion gap resolved, the patient was discharged to
the floor on [**2125-12-16**].  The patient also had evidence of
rhabdomyolysis with high CK and a flat MB and troponin.  The
patient had acute renal failure probably secondary to
hypovolemia from DKA as well as post obstructive from
neurogenic bladder and unable to urinate and in addition,
probably toxicity from rhabdo.  The patient's creatinine
continued to fall with hydration and was 1.3 on discharge.

The patient's blood sugar remained somewhat elevated
throughout the admission and the patient was started on
Glargine and titrated up to 35 units q h.s.  On discharge the
patient also remained on a regular insulin sliding scale.

For the patient's pneumonia the patient started on a 7 day
course of Levaquin 250 mg po q d which can be titrated up
according to improved renal function.  The patient can also
be restarted on his ACE inhibitor prior to discharge as he
has now normal renal function.

For the neurogenic bladder the patient has been extensively
worked up for this and usually straight caths himself at
home.  A Foley was kept in place throughout the admission and
will be discontinued in rehab.

The patient was also found to have elevated hepatic enzymes
with an ALT of 217, AST 123, alkaline phosphatase 56, total
bilirubin of 0.3 on [**2125-12-15**].  The patient's hepatitis
serologies were sent.  The patient appears to have been
infected with hepatitis A at some point.  This is unknown
whether this infection had been recent and had contributed to
the patient's presentation or not.  The patient's TSH was
also checked and found to be .12.  However, the free T4 was
low normal.  These TFTs should be followed as an outpatient.

As for the rhabdomyolysis, it resolved with hydration and the
patient's CKs were downtrending.  The patient was in good
condition on discharge and will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
as an outpatient.  The patient is discharged to rehab on
[**2125-12-19**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Guaifenesin 10 ml q 6 hours prn,
Senna one tablet q d, Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], Tylenol q 4-6 hours
prn, Trazodone 25 mg q h.s. prn, Protonix 40 mg q d, Glargine
35 units q h.s., Regular insulin 10 units at dinner, Regular
insulin sliding scale, Percocet 1-2 tabs q 4-6 hours prn,
Propranolol 40 mg tid and Levofloxacin 250 mg po q d through
