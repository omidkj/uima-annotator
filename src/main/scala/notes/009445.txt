Pertinent Results:
[**2203-10-4**] ANGIOGRAM:
1.  Tiny 1-2 mm questionable infundibulum versus questionable
broad-based
focal ectasia versus tiny aneurysms noted at the level of the
anterior
communicating artery and right middle cerebral artery
bifurcation.
2.  Evaluation of the right external carotid artery, left
internal carotid
artery, left external carotid artery, right vertebral artery,
and left
vertebral artery demonstrates no definite evidence of aneurysms
or vascular malformations.


[**2203-10-4**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
Status post ventriculostomy catheter placement from a right
frontal approach with tip in the third ventricle;
stable-to-slight increase in extent of subarachnoid hemorrhage
with layering intraventricular hemorrhage within the occipital
horns of the lateral ventricles

[**2203-10-5**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is moderately dilated and elongated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the
basal-mid inferior wall, and inferior/anterior septum. The LV
apex and distal anterior wall appeared normokinetic, although
their function may be overestimated given significantly
foreshortened apical views. The right ventricle is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2203-10-5**] CXR FINDINGS:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube has
been advanced.  The tip of the tube now projects over the
gastroesophageal junction.  To ensure correct position in the
stomach, the tube must be advanced by another 10 cm. Unchanged
position of the endotracheal tube.  Unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload.  The extent and severity
of the pre-existing right lower lung parenchymal opacity is
unchanged.

[**2203-10-6**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (9:27 AM)
CONCLUSION:
1. Interval increase of the hemorrhage at the mid brain compared
to the previous study, concerning for hemorrhage within the mid
brain versus expanding hemorrhage at the interpeduncular
cistern.
2. Interval increase in the size of the ventricles as described
above,concerning for hydrocephalus.

[**2203-10-6**] CT UP EXT W/O Study Date (9:27 AM)
IMPRESSION:
1.  Comminuted and impacted right medial clavicle fracture.
2.  Severe emphysema.
3.  Multinodular thyroid can be further evaluated by ultrasound,
if clinically indicated.

[**2203-10-6**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of (2:05 PM)
CONCLUSION:
1. The hemorrhage at the midbrain has seems to have increased in
size compared to the study from earlier this morning.
2. There is an increased amount of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
around the catheter site.
3. The size of the ventricles is unchanged compared to the study
performed
earlier this morning.

[**2203-10-7**] PORTABLE HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST (7:45 AM)
CONCLUSION:
1.  Subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage, unchanged
compared to the previous study.
2.  No new evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or acute
infarction.
3.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage around the catheter site is
stable compared to the previous study.
4.  Size of the ventricles is unchanged compared to the previous
study.
