Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2192-5-1**] - Coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels. AVR
(19mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Pericardial Valve)


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with aortic stenosis which is a
relatively new diagnosis from [**2190**]. Approximately two months
ago, she began developing dyspnea and chest pressure with
walking upstairs, as well as intermittent mild pedal edema. A
recent echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis with an
aortic
valve area of <0.8cm2 and a mean gradient of 37mmHg. She has
been referred for possible aortic valve replacement surgery. If
surgery was deemed too high risk, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] would like her
evaluated for CoreValve trial of percutaneous aortic valve
replacement. There was mention of a calcified aorta on a
previous note.

Carotid Bruit       Transmitted vs. Bruit


Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2192-5-1**]
Prebypass
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The estimated cardiac
index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Postbypass
The patient is on a phenylephrine infusion and is A-paced.
Biventricular systolic function remains normal. There is a new
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. The valve is
well-seated and there is trace aortic regurgitation without
evidence of perivalvular leak. The mean gradient across the
valve is 8 mmHg at a cardiac output 4.0 L/min. The mitral
regurgitation is now mild-moderate. Tricuspid regurgitation
remains trace. The thoracic aorta is intact post-decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16251**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2192-5-1**] for
surgical management of her aortic valve and coronary artery
disease. She was taken directly to the operating room where she
underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and an
aortic valve replacement using a 19mm [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively she was
taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next
several hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed. On
postoperative day two, she was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. She had brief episodes of afib and her
betablocker was titrated up with good effect. Pacing wires were
remove POD#5 without incident. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility and they are recommending rehab. On POD 6 she was
cleared for discharge to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. All follow up
appointments were advised.
