Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
right hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
open reduction with internal fixation right hip


History of Present Illness:
73yo RH F who is POD#1 from R hip repair after a mechanical
fall caused a fracture. Perioperatively, she has been treated
with a beta blocker and now postoperatively she has been started
on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. She was completely normal per
her
daughter today around 4-5pm, apart from pain, which was
controlled with oxycodone (last dose 3pm and no further
narcotics). At 8:30pm, however, the ortho PA was paged by the
patient's nurse after she was found to have a new left facial
droop and was thought to be disoriented and "confused", with
slurred speech. We are consulted for concern of an acute
infarction.

The patient has had no nausea/vomiting and denies headache (in
fact, she denies any difficulty or impairment). She denies
dysarthria, though her son-in-law attests that her speech is
markedly different from baseline.

CT/CTA:
1. No obvious infarcts are noted on the non-contrast CT.
However, MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive
for the detection of acute infarcts.
2. Short segment focal stenosis in the pericallosal artery and
right middle cerebral artery M2 segment which could be
stenoocclusive or thromboembolic.
3. Mild atherosclerotic calcification in bilateral cervical
internal carotid arteries, close to their origins, with no
flow-limiting stenosis.
4. Multilevel degenerative disease of the cervical spine, not
adequately evaluated on the present study.
5. Biapical pleural scarring.

MRI/MRA:
Limited study due to motion artifact.
There are multiple acute infarcts in the distal right MCA
territory, possibly embolic in etiology.

TTE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present
withbidirectional  shunting (small amount). Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and  systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the  left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are  normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in  diameter and free of atherosclerotic
plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic
regurgitation. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or  vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The
mitral valve leaflets are  structurally normal. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild  (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT chest and abdomen
1.  No central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.  Some small opacities in the right lower lobe are
nonspecific, and could be regions of focal atelectasis.
5-mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.  In the absence
of known
malignancy, followup in one year is recommended.
Postoperative appearance to the right hip and surrounding soft
tissues and
muscles consistent with recent surgery.


CXR [**2106-4-1**]
Small bilateral pleural effusions with left basilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs.[**Known lastname 95459**] presented to the Emergency Department complaining
of right hip pain after a fall. She was evaluated by the
Orthopaedics department and found to have a right
intertrochanteric hip fracture. She was admitted, consented, and
medically cleared for surgery. On [**2106-3-29**], she was prepped and
brought down to the operating room for surgery.
Intra-operatively, she was closely monitored and remained
hemodynamically stable. She tolerated the procedure well without
any difficulty or complication. Post-operatively, she was
extubated and transferred to the PACU for further stabilization
and monitoring. She was then transferred to the floor for
further recovery. On the floor, she remained hemodynamically
stable with her pain controlled.

On [**3-30**], she had acute onset dysarthria, left facial droop and
left arm/leg weakness. On exam, she also had left-sided neglect
and anosognosia and was inattentive, falling asleep frequently.
CT and MRI showed right MCA infarction and the patient was
transferred to the ICU for further monitoring. Metoprolol was
discontinued and blood pressure allowed to autoregulate. She was
started on aspirin 325mg daily, as her previously documented
"allergy" consisted only of GI upset. She was also started on
zocor for secondary stroke prevention. FLP was normal and HbA1c
5.7. She had an uneventful ICU course and by the next morning,
her dysarthria and neglect had improved, leaving her with UMN
pattern of weakness, affecting her face/arm/leg. Transferred to
the floor.

TTE from [**3-30**] was unremarkable for source of cardioembolism. TEE
showed small secundum ASD with bidirectional flow, no source of
thrombi and no significant aortic arch atheroma. Cardioembolic
event thought most likely etiology of stroke in presence INR
2.0, so new goal INR 2.5-3.5.  CTA of the neck showed "Short
segment focal stenosis in the pericallosal artery and right
middle cerebral artery M2 segment" thought to be stenoocclusive
or thromboembolic.  She was covered with lovenox 60mg [**Hospital1 **] and
started on coumadin 5mg qhs on [**3-31**], with the plan on continuing
for 3-6 months and then transition to aspirin. LENIs were
negative for DVT. Lovenox ceased on [**2106-4-2**] as INR therapeutic.
INR supraptherapeutic to maximum 6.1 on [**2106-4-3**]. Coumadin held.
Today ([**2106-4-5**]) INR 2.4 and restarting coumadin at 2mg daily.
Please continue to monitor INR.

There was an episode of hypotension overnight [**2106-3-31**] responsive
to fluid treatment.Repeat head CT was unchanged. Abdominal CT
was negative for retroperitoneal bleed. Stools negative for
blood. Hct dropped to 22.0 and transfused 2 units rbc.
Conincident with hypotensive episode, increased oxygen
requirement  occurred with concern for PE in context of
perioperative stroke. CTA chest negative for PE. CT did show R
upper lobe lung nodule which requires follow up scan at 1 year.
Hematocrit now stable.

Urinary tract infection was diagnosed on [**2106-4-4**] and treatment
commenced with ciprofloxacin.  Switched from tablets to
suspension following episode of vomiting. To complete 3 days
course (day 2 today).

Repeat CT chest in 1 year for right upper lobe lung nodule.

Neurology and orthopedic follow up arranged.
