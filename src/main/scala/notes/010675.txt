Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 663**]
Chief Complaint:
fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R hip arthroplasty for R femoral neck fracture on [**2128-7-21**]
Blood transfusions


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 16642**] is a 74-y/o gentleman with CAD (s/p CABG), h/o
mechanical AVR for aortic regurgitation (on home Coumadin),
chronic systolic/diastolic CHF [**1-24**] ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p
ICD placement for primary prevention, chronic a-fib, who now
presents from [**Hospital6 33**] after he was admitted there
after a fall.

Patient reports he was walking his dog at night, after his usual
4oz alcoholic beverage, when he began to feel "dizzy". When
asked about what this means, he reported "things just went
black" and he felt as though he was going to pass out. He tried
to find a place to sit but stumbled and fell inside his garage
with concrete floor. Denies any loss of consciousness or head
trauma. Reports he tried to protect his head with his hands but
has no pain anywhere other than his hip. Denies any preceeding
chest pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, double vision or
difficulty breathing.

Of note, patient had gone to see his cardiologist 3 dayst PTA
and had been re-started on Digoxin and had his dose of
metoprolol decreased to 50mg daily.

In [**Hospital6 **], patients vitals were Temp 98.6, HR 70,
BP 76/50 and RR 14, O2 Sat 99% on room air. Portable AP films of
the hip revealed an acute, subcapital hip fracture on the right,
with significant proximal migration of the femur with respect to
the femoral head. INR at admission was 4.3, Hct 27.3, Creatinine
1.8. EtOH level of 78mg/dl. CK 180, CK MB 4.1 and Tn T 0.02.
Patient received 2 units of PRBC, total 7.5mg Vitamin K. Has not
received pressors, #18 and #20 gaugue PIV. Foley catheter was
placed. CT Scan of head and abdomen were obtained, with the
latter only pertinent for a small hernia in the periumbilical
region containing a short segment of small intestine. CT pelvis
revealed acute right hip fracture with extensive soft tissue
contussion adjacent to the right hip with small associated
hematoma. Orthopedic surgery was consulted and decision to
pursue hip arthoplasty once coagulopathy was resolved was
formulated. Patient requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] as he has
obtained most of his care here.

[**2128-7-18**] Pelvis AP XR - Single frontal radiograph of the pelvis
demonstrates a displaced and angulated fracture of the right
femoral neck. Fracture is displaced 0-25% of the width of the
femoral neck. There is external rotation of the distal fracture
fragment and proximal displacement of the distal fracture
fragment. The left hip is unremarkable. The sacroiliac joints
and symphysis pubis are normal.
Surgical staples project over the right groin and vascular
calcifications
project over the low pelvis and left thigh.
[**2128-7-19**] Echo - The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
[**2128-7-19**] CXR - No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2128-7-19**] Lumbosacral spine - Marked lumbar spondylosis without
spondylolisthesis. Right femoral neck fracture, better seen on
recent hip radiographs.
[**2128-7-19**] CT Head - IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or
hemorrhage.
[**2128-7-20**] Stress MIBI - No anginal symptoms or ECG changes noted
from baseline. Nuclear report sent separately. ; 1. Fixed,
severe perfusion defects at the inferior and inferolateral
walls. Global hyponkinesis and septal dyskinesis  2. The
calculated LVEF is 36% and the LV-EDV is 149mL.
[**2128-7-22**] CT Abd / Pelvis -
1. Moderate hematoma involving the right gluteal muscles in this
patient
status post right hip replacement.
2. Thickening of the cecum and ascending colon. Differential
diagnosis
includes ischemia, infection and inflammatory causes.
3. Small epigastric hernia containing small bowel. No evidence
for small-
bowel obstruction.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions and septal thickening are
consistent
with CHF.
CT Right Lower Extremity - [**2128-7-28**] - Large predominantly
intramuscular hematoma involving the right gluteal muscles and
anterior thigh musculature as above. Without IV contrast, we
cannot
assess for active bleeding/extravasation.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr [**Known lastname 16642**] is a 74 y/o M w h/o CAD (s/p CABG), aortic
regurg (s/p mechanical valve replacement), chronic combined
systolic/diastolic CHF (LVEF 45%) [**1-24**] ischemic CMP s/p ICD
placement for primary prevention, chronic a-fib, who originally
presented w fall and was diagnosed with R hip fracture. He was
transferred to BIMDC on [**2128-7-18**] for R hip ORIF. His course has
been complicated by post-op bleeding in the setting of required
anticoagulation for the presence of a mechanical valve. The
bleeding re
