HPI: Patient is a 80yo RHM with Afib but not on Coumadin, HTN,
DM
and hx of stroke over 10 years ago with some residual L sided
weakness who was found down per VNA at 3pm with L slurred speech
and L sided weakness.  Per report, he was taken by ambulance to
[**Location 84234**]where his initial BP was extremely elevated
with
SBP into 280s for which he was given labetalol x2~3.  Head CT
was
negative for hemorrhage then patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for
further care.

Per patient, he woke up around 10am and ate breakfast which was
delivered per meals on wheels.  He did not speak to anybody - he
lives alone and ambulates with a walker and reports to have VNA
once or twice weekly.  He then fell around 10:30 am - he is
unable to recall why he fell but he thinks he may have tripped
but he could not get up hence was on the floor until VNA found
him at 3pm.

He denies any recent illness, fever, cough, N/V/D or HA.  He
reports to be smoking as much as possible (>1 PPD) which he has
been doing over 50 years and not taking any of his meds.  He
reports to have not taken any meds for over 2 months at least,
however, per [**Hospital1 802**] who is also his HCP, she reports that his
meds
are overseen per VNA hence he may be more compliant than he
reports.  Also, she recalls that when she accompanied him to his
PCP appt about 6 months ago, his PCP may have told him that he
can take ASA instead of Coumadin for his Afib.

Of note, patient was in nursing home about 6~8 weeks ago for PT
and rehab after vascular surgery for RLE artery occlusion.



Past Medical History:
1. Stroke - over 10 yrs ago, initially could not move L side,
talk or walk per patient.

Social History:
Lives alone with weekly VNA for assistance and has meals
delivered per Meals on Wheels.  Walks with walker at baseline
and
does not leave the house much.  Reports to smoke as much as
possible, >1 PPD for the past 50 years.  Divorced and has 3
grown
children out in West Coast, nearest [**Doctor First Name **] and HCP is [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) **]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 84235**] in [**Location (un) 3844**]. Full code - confirmed per
HCP.

affect.  Oriented to person, place, and month.  Fluent speech
with mild dysarthria, no dysnomia with high frequency words and
intact repetition.

Cranial Nerves:

Motor:
Normal bulk - slightly higher tone on L than R and more on LUE
than LLE.  No adventitious movements.  Unable to move L side but
appears full strength on R.  Withdraws to noxious stim on L but
not anti-gravity.

decreased/near total absence on L body although intact to
noxious
stim.

Echo [**2142-11-27**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
30-40 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and
akinesis of the inferior free wall and posterior wall. The basal
inferior and posterior walls are thin and fibrotic. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures
of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet
is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CTA head and neck and perfusion ([**2142-11-26**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Likely embolic occlusion of the M1 segment of the right
middle cerebral
artery with perfusion findings of infarct involving virtually
the entire right MCA distribution.

2. Just over 60% stenosis of the proximal left common carotid
artery.

3. Moderate atherosclerotic disease at the carotid bifurcations
bilaterally, with likely an ulcerated plaque involving the
proximal right external carotid artery and extensive soft plaque
within the carotid bulb on the right.

4. 8 mm nodular soft tissue density within the left paraglottic
fat may be a lymph node but is of unclear etiology and should be
correlated with clinical findings and/or direct visualization.
Associated mild thickening of the lingual tonsils,
glossoepiglottic fold and anterior surface of the epiglottis.

5. Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine.

6. Severe atrophy and evidence of old cortical embolic infarcts.
Extensive
chronic microvascular ischemic change.

CT head [**11-28**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Evolving acute and virtual-complete right middle cerebral
artery territory
infarction with hemorrhagic transformation and extension of the
hemorrhage
into the right lateral and third ventricles, layering in
bilateral occipital
horns.

2. Significant leftward shift of midline structures, with marked
subfalcine
herniation and less marked uncal herniation.
