History of Present Illness:
79 year-old Male with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**35**] years ago, MI and HTN
initially presented with chest pain. Pt has known 3vd, was
evaluted by cath for chest pain with a positive stress test in
[**1-27**]. Initially pt presented to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**]. He has
reportedly had chest pain intermittently for months. Chest pain
started 2 hrs prior to presentation at OSH, described as
substernal chest pressure, sudden onset and gradually worsening,
radiating to L arm. Pt denied radiation to back or tearing
senation on initial presenation to OSH ED, pain was [**8-28**]. At
OSH pt was started on nitro gtt and heparin gtt, and then was
chest pain free. EKG from OSH while chest pain showed [**Street Address(2) 2051**]
elevation in aVR, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressino in I, II, aVF, V3-V6, which
improved somewhat after chest pain free. No fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abd pain, neck pain, or other
complaints. Pain is similar to prior MI, has had episodes of
short lived chest pain intermittently since CABG but never had
to use nitroglycerin until today. Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED initial VS were 97.4 90 148/76 16 95% 3L Nasal
Cannula. Pt was initially [**12-29**] CP and then CP free here on nitro
gtt, received aspirin 325 mg as well. Cardiology consulted in ED
and recommended addition of integrillin gtt instead of plavix
given known 3vd, also received metoprolol 25 mg PO. Trop
elevated at 0.18, CK/MB flat. Admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service cath in
the am.
.
Right femoral artery was used for IABP, RHC via right femoral
vein, and Left femoral artery for PCI.   During cath, patient
had sudden onset of respiratory distress thought secondary to
CHF (ischemic-induced), this lead to intubation in the cath lab.
 RHC was done and observed a PCWP of 40, which lead to placement
of IABP.  Cath showed left main disease and OM disease, these
were interveined on sequentially.  His PCWP was noted to have
dropped to 20s at the end of the case. Findings during his LHC
included right dominant coronary arteries. LMCA with diffuse
70-80% with ostial 90%. LAD TO origin. LCX prox 70%, OM1 origin
90%. RCA proximal and ostial 50-60%. SVG none. LIMA to LAD: free
LIMA patent to LAD. He had placement of DES to LM and DES/BMS to
CX OM. He received heparin, integrilin, nitroglycerine drip,
lasix, bivalirudin, norepinephrine, cefazolin.
.
In CCU, he was intubated, sedated. The patient had an IABP in
place.
.
Per floor team, review of systems: he denies any prior history
of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2130-10-26**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION - Selective coronary angiography
of this right dominant system revealed 3-vessel coronary artery
disease. There was an ostial 90% stenosis of the LMCA which was
diffusely diseased to 70-80%. The LAD was 100% occluded
proximally. The LMCA gave rise to a patent LCx with a proximal
70% stenosis at the take-off of OM1, which extended into OM1
narrowing the ostial segment of OM1 to 90%. There was diffuse
plaquing of the distal Lx. Venous conduit angiography was not
performed as the SVG to OM1/OM2 is known to be occluded.
Selective arterial conduit angiography of the LIMA arising from
the ascending aorta to the mid-LAD revealed this to be patent.
Initial hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated left and right
heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of
27mmHg and a mean PCW of 31 mmHg. There was mild pulmonary
artery hypertension with PA 45/30mmHg but no significant
transpulmonary gradient and a PVR of only 38dynes*sec*cm-5. The
cardiac output and index were reduced at 4.2L/min and 2.1 L/min
respectively. Repeat hemodynamics after insertion of the IABP
and baloon angioplasty of the LMCA showed a decrease in the PCW
to a mean of 18mmHg but persistently decreased mixed venous
saturation
(60%). Native 3-vessel coronary artery disease. Culprit lesion
for presentation likley 90% ostial LMCA. Respiratory failure
secondary to acute on chronic left ventricular systolic
dysfunction requiring mechanical ventilation. IABP insertion for
circulatory support in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Mild
pulmonary artery hypertension.
.
[**2130-10-27**] 2D-ECHO - Poor image quality (echo contrast used). The
left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
mid
