History of Present Illness:
66yo female transferred to the MICU after PEA arrest on the
floor.
**
66 yo female with severe COPD, Afib, hx of breast CA who
presented [**2142-1-24**] with respiratory distress most likely secondary
to COPD exacerbation in setting of respiratory infection. She
was treated in the MICU with BIPAP for brief period then
transferred to floor. Due to large loculated pleural effusion on
the left, which was unamenable to bedside thoracentesis, she was
scheduled for a Bronchoscopy/BAL and VATS with IP and thoracic
surgery. On the floor, she was treated with vanc/zosyn/levo.
*
Her hospital course was complicated by development of SVT
(afib/aflutter) and was started on diltiazem and quinidine as
per Electrophysiology team. The hospital course was also
complicated by ?volume overload and acid base imbalances. She
was taken to the OR on [**2142-1-30**] where she underwent decortication
due to difficulty decompressing the lung for VATS as well as
Bronchoscopy. The Bronchoscopy found significant thickened
mucous secretions which were suctioned out and during the
decortication, the patient was found to have a significant
empyema. 3 chest tubes were placed in the OR. The PACU course
was complicated by difficult extubation as well as marginal
respiratory status, CO2 retention (CO2 as high as 95 on ABG) and
acid base imbalance. She was successfully extubated on POD#1 and
transferred to floor on POD#2 on [**2142-2-1**].
*
After [**Hospital **] hospital course notable for: continued pain at
thoractoomy site treated with morhpine/dilaudid, complicated by
some waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status. Transient Afib/flutter
responsive to iv diltiazem. Chest tubes were dc'd on [**2-4**]. She
developed oliguric ATN, followed by renal [**2-5**] who felt due to
prerenal (due to transient inschemia from afib/flutter).
*
Then overnight on [**2-5**], noted to have increasing SOB and
complete white-out of left lung. She underwent bronch which
revealed a thick mucous plud in left mainstem bronchus. She
underwent repeat bronch on [**2-6**] at 14:40 with showed persistent
mucous plugging of L mainstem. Then at 17:20, RN checked gag
reflex which was present, and the patient was given dinner. RN
then noted the patient slumping over and hypoxia, and then code
was called at 17:25pm. Patient was found to be in PEA arrest.
Anesthesia intubated pt and suction showed food-stuffs from ET
tube. She was given epi x 2 and then atropine and bicarb. Spont
circulation resumed at 17:35. Pt was transferred to the MICU.
*
Repeat bronch on transfer to the MICU showed food particles in
the right and left stems, and a therapeutic aspiration was
performed. The ETT was advanced 2 cm to the carina.

She continues to report cigarette cravings.  She denies any
alcohol or illicit drug use.

-Gen: well nutritioned caucasian female lying in bed wearing NC

muscle use.
-HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric.  Non-tender, non-pruritic,
erythematous swelling around both eyes.  As per pt, no visual
changes.
-Neck: no retractions, JVD not appreciated
-CV: tachy, regular? s1, s2
-Chest: [**Month (only) **] bs, poor air movement, wheezing bilaterally [**12-17**] way

mid abdomen, obese, soft, NT, ND, BS+
-Ext: UE: swelling L>R. no c/c/pitting edema (however le is
moderately swollen with non-pitting edema)
-Neuro: CN II-XII grossly intact


Pertinent Results:
-EKG [**2142-1-24**]: SVT/Afutter in 150ss
-CXR [**2142-1-24**]: LL Opacification, obscuring of L CP angle
-CTA [**2142-1-25**]: Negative for PE.
-CXR on [**2142-2-18**]:

SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made to a prior study dated
[**2142-2-16**]. Tracheostomy tube and left PICC catheter remain
in stable, satisfactory position. Heart is at the upper limits
of normal for size. Mediastinal contours are within normal
limits. As before, there is perihilar fullness and
indistinctness of pulmonary vasculature, in keeping with volume
overload. Allowing for differences in technique, the appearance
is unchanged. There is improved aeration of the left lower lobe,
with some patchy opacities persisting. There is blunting of the
costophrenic sulci bilaterally, suggesting small bilateral
pleural effusions. Numerous surgical clips are visualized in the
left upper abdomen.

IMPRESSION:

1) Stable volume overload.
2) Improved aeration of the left lower lobe

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory distress: Due to COPD flare in the setting of
bacterial pneumonia. Pt had a CTA while in MICU initially ruling
out PE which also found loculated left pleural effusions as well
as ascites and anasarca. Pt is s/p bronch and decortication with
chest tube placement for empyema. After her PEA arrest, she
remained in respiratory failure and ultimately underwent bedside
tracheostomy placement by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 57475**] on [**2142-2-12**].
Was unable to be weaned to PS due to low lung compliance,
presumably due to pneumonia, plueral effusion and total body
volume overload. She was placed on lasix drip and was diuresed.
Was able to tolerate PS for a short period of time on [**2142-2-19**]
15/15, and will require a very slow trach wean with trials of PS
each day.
.
A) PNA/Empyema: Pt with LLL infiltrate suggestive of PNA. Pt is
s/p bronch and decortication with chest tube placement for
empyema. Continued on vancomycin/zosyn for presumed
ventilator-associated pneumonia (course finished [**2142-2-19**]). She
received several bronchosopies during the course of her
hospitalization to clear secretions/mucous plugs.
.
C) COPD: Pt with significant COPD as per history (FEV1 44% on
home oxygen).  Continued on steroids, Albuterol and Atrovent
MDIs. Steroids were intially weaned on the floor to prednisone
30 qd, but were increased back up to 60 after PEA arrest. She is
now at 40 mg QD, and should get a very slow slow taper, given
her significant problems with bronchoconstriction.
.
D) CHF: Pt with non-pitting edema on LE, mild CHF on CXR and
generalized anasarca with ascites on CT scan suggestive of
volume overload.  Pt was actively diuresed on Sat with good
urine output and [**Month (only) **]. in LE edema. TTE was performed [**1-27**]
showing mod depressed cardiac function (EF 45-55%) and ?
diastolic dysfunction (LA and RA dilation,
