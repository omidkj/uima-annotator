CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right sided weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84 year old lady with
a past medical history of hypertension and dementia, who
presents to the Emergency Room for evaluation of fall.  She
was in her usual state of health today except for fatigue,
when she fell in her bedroom.  Her son went into the room,
finding her on the floor with a large bruise on the right
side of her face.  She was slurring her speech and not making
sense but her son does not remember anything about her limb
movements.  She became progressively more sleepy.  EMS was
notified and she was brought to an outside Emergency Room for
further evaluation.  Because that Emergency Room did not have
a functioning CT scanner, she was sent to [**Hospital1 346**] for further work-up.

Her systolic blood pressure upon arrival was 268.  While in
the Emergency Room, the neurology resident witnessed two
episodes of focal shaking of her arms, lasting 30 seconds and
resolving spontaneously.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension. Dementia.

MEDICATIONS:
Captopril 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
Evista 60 mg p.o. q. week.
Wellbutrin 150 mg p.o. q. day.
Dyazide 37.5/25 one tablet p.o. q. day.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day.
Colace.
Multi-vitamin.
Caltrate 600 mg p.o. twice a day.
Xalatan eye drops.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her son.  She walks
with a cane/walker.  She is independent in her activities of
daily living.  There is no history of tobacco, alcohol or
drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission, temperature was 97.4;
pulse 98; blood pressure 233/91; respiratory rate 15; 100% on
room air.  General:  Uncommunicative elderly woman, lying in
bed, looking towards the left.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND
THROAT shows right facial hematoma. Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and
rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops noted.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  2+ pulses with no edema. Neurologic
examination:  She is awake but not following commands. She
does not attempt to speak.  She is uncooperative with
examiner. She would not let the examiner assess pupils or
extraocular movements; however, a left gaze preference was
noted.  The right side withdraws less to painful stimuli than
the left side.  Her reflexes were brisk throughout.  Her toes
were upgoing bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 11.9; hematocrit of 39.1;
platelets 313.  Sodium of 135; potassium of 4.1; chloride
102; bicarbonate 24; BUN 15; creatinine 0.8; glucose 164; ALT
20; AST 17; alkaline phosphatase 73; total bilirubin 0.1.
Amylase 98; lipase 41.

Non contrast head CT showed left thalamic hemorrhage,
measuring about 2.5 by 2.5 by 3 cm with white midline shift.
There is a large amount of periventricular white matter
disease and generalized atrophy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Neurology:  Left thalamic bleed.  Given the
patient's hemorrhage, INR was checked and found to be normal
at 1.0.  She did not require any blood products to correct
her INR.  She was put on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Corrected Dilantin level was quite high, despite being on
Dilantin 100 mg p.o. three times a day so free Dilantin was
checked and found to be at 2.  Given that this level is at
the upper end of normal, her Dilantin was decreased to 100 mg
twice a day.  A Dilantin level was checked on [**2126-11-25**] but is
still pending. Her blood pressure was controlled with
Labetalol and Captopril during her hospitalization.  She was
ruled out for a myocardial infarction which may have led to
this bleed.

Infectious disease:  Urinary tract infection.  The patient
had an elevated white count that was unaccounted for.  A
urine culture was obtained showing Proteus mirabilis which
was sensitive to Cefuroxime.  She was placed on the
cephalosporins for seven days and her urinalysis cleared
along with a white count that decreased.  She had no
intravenous access so a central line was left in place. Blood
cultures were obtained from the central line and only showed
contaminant with staph coagulase negative organisms.  A
Clostridium difficile toxin was checked and was found to be
negative.

Congestive heart failure:  The patient's sodium was noted to
decrease from 135 upon admission to 128.  A chest x-ray was
obtained showing no evidence of pneumonia but did show
congestive heart failure.  The patient was diuresed and her
sodium came back up. However, she was diuresed a little bit
too far given the rising BUN so she was gently replenished
with free water boluses through her nasogastric tube.

Gastroenterology:  The patient had a nasogastric tube placed
for nutrition but it was thought that the percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy would be needed to replace the
temporary nasogastric tube. The son will decide on whether a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy would be called for.  The
rest of the dictation will be dictated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
