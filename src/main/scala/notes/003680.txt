Brief Hospital Course:
Hypotension and respiratory distress were most likely 2nd to
aspiration vs sepsis vs pulmonary edema.  Pt was intubated and
on started on antibiotics. She was treated with improvement in
the MICU.

On [**2148-12-10**], a liver and kidney donor became available. She was
cleared for surgery. On [**12-10**], a liver was transplanted by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Attempt was made to do a splenectomy prior to the
renal [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], but this was too difficult secondary to the
extremely large polycystic liver wrapped around the spleen. She
was very coagulopathic. Bleeding was controlled then a renal
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with a 6-French
double-J stent inserted into the ureter and a JP drain. Drains
were also placed posterior to the liver and at the hilum as well
as in the splenic bed.

Induction immunosuppression was administered consiting of ATG,
cellcept and steroids. Postop, she was transferred to the SICU
for management. Postop course was complicated requirining CVVH
for delayed renal graft function. LFTs trended down immediately.
Duplex of the liver was appropriate. Renal duplex US
demonstrated lack of diastolic flow of the interpolar arteries,
with an RI of 1. There was flow within the main renal vein. She
experienced ATN.

She failed to extubate and a trache was considered, but
eventually with improving renal/liver function, she managed to
extubate on *****. Of note, on [**12-19**], TSH was noted to be 27, T3
61 and T4 3.0. Levothyroxine was increased. She remained
tachypneic and short of breath. On [**12-11**], a bronchoscopy was
performed as she has aspirated bilious appearing emesis. BAL was
performed in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe.
Twenty ml of greenish aspirate was obtained. Culture grew
10-100,000 colonies of Enterobacter Cloacae. She was treated
with Cipro for 14 days from [**Date range (1) **]. Vancomycin was
administered from [**12-10**] thru [**12-17**]. Micafungin was administered
from [**12-11**] trough [**12-25**] for antifungal coverage per [**Month/Year (2) **]
protocol. On [**12-15**], a CVL was removed to simplify lines. Tip was
sent for culture and grew VRE. Linezolid was started on [**12-18**]
until stop date [**12-30**].

CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions with right greater
than left. On [**12-24**], a right thoracentesis was done removing 1.5
liters. This fluid was cultured and had no growth. A left
thoracentesis was done on [**12-25**] for 1100ml. This also had no
growth on culture. Respiratory status improved with room air
sats of 99%. Respiratory rate averaged 20 bpm. BP ranged between
130/90-145/100. She was mantained on lopressor.

CVVHD was continued during most of her SICU stay. As urine
output increased, CVVHD was stopped on [**12-26**]. Creatinine averaged
0.6 on dialysis. Once off CVVHD, creatinine increased to 2.0 on
[**12-30**]. By [**1-2**], creatinine had decreased to 1.8 with daily urine
output averaging 2.9 liters/day on Lasix. A daily dose of oral
Lasix was prescribed. Florinef was added on [**12-30**] for
hyperkalemia. On [**12-30**], she was transfused with 2 units of PRBC
for a hct of 23.3.

Immunosuppression consisted of ATG (75mg each dose x3 doses),
cellcept and steroid taper. Prograf was initiated on postop day
2 and adjusted daily per trough levels with goal achieved. Goal
prograf was 10.

On [**12-28**], she transferred out of the SICU to the Med [**Doctor First Name **] Unit.

Preop, she was very debilitated with muscle wasting. Postop, she
was more so and required PT. A [**Doctor Last Name **] lift was recommended for
transfers. Rehab was recommended. Diet was poorly tolerated and
nasojejeunal tube feedings were administered using Novasource
Renal. She did have some diarrhea. Stools were negative for
C.diff. Cellcept dosing was adjusted to qid with decreased GI
side effects.

On [**12-26**], a speech and swallow evaluation was completed without
s/sx of aspiration at bedside.  She appeared safe for initiation
of regular diet, thin liquids, pills whole with thin.

Energy level improved overall although she is still very
debilitated. She will transfer to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 8**]
with twice weekly lab monitoring. Tunnelled HD line should be
flushed with saline/heparin every 2-3 days as she is currently
off dialysis. Immunosuppression should be managed only by the
[**Hospital1 1326**] Serv
