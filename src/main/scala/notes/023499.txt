Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with Drug eluting stent to Proximal and
mid Left coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84782**] is a 82 year old previously healthy gentleman
transferred from an OSH for cardiac catheterization after
developing chest pain with ECG changes concerning for STEMI. The
patient initially developed pain yesterday morning while
defecating described as sharp back pain in his scapulas that
resolved after 10 minutes. The pain recurred yesterday afternoon
with exertion but resolved spontaneously after 10 minutes. Today
while having a bowel movement, he developed bilateral scapular
pain with associated [**7-25**] chest pressure that did not resolve.
He then presented to an OSH ED, where he was noted to have STE
in V1-V2 concerning for ACS. He received ASA 325, plavix 600 mg,
heparin bolus and gtt, integrilin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg, and 5
mg x3 IV metoprolol and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient underwent PCI with DES to mid-LAD with a
right groin hematoma formation s/p sheath removal. He was then
transferred to the CCU for further management. Currently, he is
resting comfortably without complaints. Denies any CP/SOB,
f/c/s, n/v, abd pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, or pain
radiating to his arm, jaw or back.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, lower
extremity edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

.
[**9-26**] Cardiac cath:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild systemic arterial hypertension.
3. Successful PCI of the proximal and mid LAD with DES.
.
[**9-27**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the mid to distal
anterior wall, septum, distal inferior wall, and apex. The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Focal left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (wrap-sround LAD territory). Mild
symmetric ventricular hypertrophy. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Dilated thoracic aorta.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84782**] is an 82 year old previously healthy gentleman
transferred from an OSH for STEMI now s/p PCI with DES to
mid-LAD.  Hospital course was complicated by kidney failure and
urinary retention.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI now s/p PCI with DES
to mid-LAD. ECG consistent with mid-LAD lesion distal to first
septal with Q waves, suggesting sub-acute presentation. At OSH,
patient received ASA 325, plavix 600, heparin gtt, integrillin,
metoprolol, and atorvastatin. After cath at this hospital, he
was continued on ASA, plavix, atorvastatin, metoprolol and
lisinopril.  He did well without recurrent cardiac symptoms.  He
will need follow-up blood work to evaluate liver function given
initiation of statin therapy.
.
# PUMP: Pt was without history of volume overload on admission.
His ECHO showed focal akinesis of the mid to distal anterior
wall, septum, distal inferior wall, and apex, EF of 40%.  He was
started on heparin given concern for clot formation in the
context of significant wall motion abnormalities. He will
require INR check on discharge.
.
# Acute Renal Failure
Creatinine rose to a high of 5.1 on admission but had normalized
by discharge.  The etiology was thought to be most likely
contrast nephropathy with urinary rentention as an aggrevating
factor.  He was seen by urology who placed a three way foley and
irrigated light pink urine.  Given his signiricant retention
they recommended dc with foley in place and urology follow-up.
He was also started on flomax.
.
# Constipation: may have been contributing to urinary retention.
Improved with laxative use.  Pt will be dc'd on laxitives.
