Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 75-year-old woman with dCHF (EF 65%) and ESRD on HD
MWF p/w SOB beginning ~8 hrs prior to arrival to ED. Patient
reports increased fluid and salt intake over the holidays as
well as bananas and tangerines, especially on day prior to
admission. She knew she was fluid-overloaded but wanted to wait
until HD tomorrow. Unfortunately, symptoms progressed throughout
the day and she called EMS. She reports orthopnea but also c/o
DOE. She also noted facial edema which she gets with CHF
exacerbations but denies PND. She also denies chest pain at rest
or with exertion, palpitations, LE edema, fevers, chills, N/V,
diaphoresis, change in chronic morning cough, change in weight.
En route EMS administered 0.8 nitro spray x 1 and she cannot
recall if she experienced relief.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.4 78 134/66 24-28 100%2L. Exam was
notable for a woman in respiratory distress with tachypnea as
well as bibasilar rales and elevated JVD. She was placed on a
NRB and her breathing improved. EKG: SR 79, LAD, TWI III, aVF-
old, c/w prior. CXR revealed increased vascular congestion and
bilateral pleural effusions. She was started on nitro gtt
titrated to symptoms. K was also 6.7 so she was given 1 g
calcium gluconate, 10 regular insulin, 2 amps D50 and 30g
kayexalate for hyperkalemia. She was seen by the renal fellow
who plans to initiate HD overnight in ICU.
.
On arrival to the floor patient reports mild relief in symptoms.
She denies chest pain and states SOb mildly improved with
oxygen.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She states she urinates "a few drops" per day which is
stable. Denies dysuria. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 732**] is a 75-year-old woman with dCHF, ESRD on HD, and CAD
admitted with acute diastolic CHF exacerbation, volume overload,
and hyperkalemia after dietary non-compliance over the holidays.

.
# Shortness of breath: Patient presented with acute onset
shortness of breath in the setting of dietary indiscretion over
the holidays.  She was in mild distress on initial presentation,
requiring 4L NC.  Nitroglycerin gtt was started for sypmtom
control.  Physical exam, CXR and history were all consistent
with volume overload and acute diastolic heart failure
exacerbation.  Lack of leukocytosis, fever, cough, CP, or
consolidation argued against another process such as PNA or PE.
Patient is HD dependent for fluid status, and nephrology was
called for urgent HD overnight.  Her I's and O's were strictly
monitored.  Patient was given information about heart healhty
eating.  She was restarted on cozaar for afterload reduction
after herpotassium improved.  Her carvedilol was continued.
.
# Hyperkalemia/ESRD on HD:  On initial presentation, patient met
criteria for emergent HD given fluid overload and hyperkalemia.
Her ECG was without evidence of hyperkalemia.  She was started
on calcium, insulin, D50 and kayexalate for hyperkalemia.
.
# CAD: With fixed defect in RCA territory and BMS to LCx in [**2140**]
with resultant improved cardiac function. Troponin mildly
elevated in setting of renal failure and CHF exacerbation but
this is non-specific. No acute EKG changes and very low
suspicion for ACS as cause of CHF exacerbation given admittance
to dietary non-compliance over the holiday.  Her ASA,
beta-blocker, and [**Last Name (un) **] were held until after HD.  She was ruled
out for a myocardial infarction via enzymes.
.
# Severe MR: Last TTE in [**Month (only) **] of this year (6 months ago) with
slightly improved valvular function and decreased pulmonary
pressures. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology clinic and may
need replacement at some point in the future.  Her heart failure
regimen was continued.
.
#. ESRD on HD: HD MWF at [**Location (un) **]. Outpatient nephrologist is Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1366**]. Currently c/b volume overload and hyperkalemia as above.
 Dialysis as above.  Patient was continued on sevelamer,
sensipar and nephrocaps.
.
# HTN: Carvedilol was continued and Cozaar was restarted after
.
# HLD : Simvastatin was continued.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:  Questionable history.  Patient was
placed on insulin sliding scale during admission.
.
#. Depression: Zoloft was continued throughout admission.
.
#. Anemia: Likely [**1-15**] ESRD on HD. Currently at baseline.
