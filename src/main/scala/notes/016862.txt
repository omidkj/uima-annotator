Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
central venous catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 83 YOF with PMHx of DVT, heart failure, and recent hip
fracture s/p ORIF presents from rehab with dyspnea and sats in
the 80s on NRB. She was discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] after ORIF on
[**2192-4-5**]. She states she has had ocasional episodes of dyspnea at
rehab that have resolved on their own. She also states she has
been eating more salt than she usually does at home. She also
complains of increased lower extremity edema over the past
several days. She was acutely dyspnic last night and unable to
sleep secondary to orthopnea. She complained of dyspnea to her
caregivers this am and was found to be hypoxic. She was
transferred from rehab today for respiratory distress.
.
In ED inital vitals T 98.6 BP 106/60 HR 89 RR 20 Sats 93% on
NRB. CXR done with suspicion of CHF. Given 40 mg IV lasix. Put
out 1.4L urine. Was then transiently hypotensive to 91/40. She
was then given 1L NS with SBP back up to 120. Given history of
DVT and recent orthapedic surgery a CTA was performed which
showed no PE.
.
Upon arrival to MICU patient was breathing comfortably on NRB.
Complained only of lower extremity edema. Stated her dyspnea was
improved compared to last night.

Pertinent Results:
CTA [**4-16**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Status post an ascending aortic graft, with unchanged
appearance of the aortic dissection with major vessels arising
from the true lumen, as well as unchanged appearance of the
large complex aneurysm arising from the false lumen at the
bifurcation.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with underlying compressive
atelectasis.
4. Stable cardiomegaly, coronary artery disease and aortic
calcifications.
.
ECHO [**4-24**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The  estimated right atrial pressure is 16-20
mmHg. There is moderate symmetric  left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is  dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. The aortic root is  moderately dilated athe sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.  The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-3-29**],
estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressures are higher. No obvious
vegetations
visualized. Mild mitral regurgitation, Eccentric moderate
tricuspid
regurgitation. Right ventricular dilation is now seen (probably
present on  prior study). Linear density in descending aorta
seen on the current study as  well; this likely represents known
aortic dissection seen on CT scan of  [**2192-4-16**].


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is an 83 year old female with history of
HTN, DM2, CAD s/p CABG, diastolic CHF, Afib,
obesity-hypoventilation and OSA on home O2, CRI, s/p repaired
aoritic dissection and recent ORIF of L hip here with
respiratory failure, hospital course notable for multiple ICU
transfers for worsening respiratory status as well as MSSA
bacteremia of unclear source. Despite aggressive intervention in
management of her cardio-pulmonary diseases, her conditioned
failed to improve.  After extensive discussions with the
patient's family, the patient was ultimately extubated had care
goals directed at comfort and expired.  For pertinent details of
the course, see below.
.
1. Respiratory failure and hypoxemia: This was thought to be
multifactorial secondary to a combination of diastolic
congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and obesity
hypoventilation.  There was no evidence of an acute coronary
syndrome. The patient received aggressive heart failure
mangement including attempts at rate control and diuresis.
However these attempts were complicated by acute renal failure
secondary to pre-renal azotemia.  After her renal function
resolved, it was still not possible for the patient to
adequately gas-exchange.  Given her progressive respiratory
compromise, the patient was initially treated with NIPPV but
eventually required endotracheal intubation and full mechanical
ventilatory support.  As above, after extensive discussions with
the family including the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, ongoing
medical support and limited functional status were thought not
to be goals compatible with patient's quality of life.  The
patient was extubated and received comfort care.
.
2. MSSA bacteremia: There was never a clear souce to the
bacteremia despite extensive imaging including xrays, CTs, TTE,
and tagged WBC scan.  As she had a relatively high degree of
bacteremia, she was planned to complete a 6 week course of
nafcillin.
.
3. Decubitus ulcer: There was no clear sign of infection of this
ulcer. She received nutritional support and local wound care.
.
4. Afib: The patient received heart rate control as above. She
was anti-coagulated with goal INR [**2-4**].
.
5. Acute on Chronic renal failure: On presenation, the patient
was at her baseline renal function.  However, as above, with the
attempts at the necessary diuresis, she did suffer acute renal
failure from pre-renal azotemia.  Following gradual volume
re-expansion toward euvolemia, the patient's renal function
recovered.
.
6. Diabetes Mellitus type 2: Cont glargine and riss, dm diet
.
7. glaucoma: She continued to receive her eye drops as
previously prescribed.
.
8. hypothyroid s/p subtotal thyroidectomy: There were no active
issues and she continued on her thyroid replacement.
.
9. Code: initally FULL then CMO as her conditioned continued to
deteriorate.
.
10. Dispo: The patient expired. The family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
declined autopsy.
