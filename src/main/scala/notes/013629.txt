SOB

None.


History of Present Illness:
53 yo female with bipolar disorder and tobacco abuse p/w acute
SOB.  She was coughing for 1 day with some nasal congestion
prior to presentation.  Then while she was going to the local
convenience store, she became acutely SOB and tachycardic.  This
did not resolve with rest so she came to the ED.
.
In the ED, she was 87% on RA with peak flows in the 200's.  She
was febrile and hemodynamically stable.  ABG was 7.35/38/93 on
5LNC.  She had a CTA that ruled out PE and pneumonia but showed
some ground glass opacities.  She was transferred to the MICU
where she was treated for a viral respiratory infection with
COPD + CHF.  (She does not have documented h/o COPD or CHF).
She improved with nebs, diuresis, solumderol and azithromycin.
.
She feels much improved with no SOB even on room air.  She does
not have cough anymore.  She denies chest pain or fevers.

CXR: Normal chest findings in a patient with history of acute
onset of shortness or breath.

CTA:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. There are linear areas of opacity along the mediastinum,
suggesting atelectasis or scarring. There are also scattered
geographic areas of ground- glass opacity, predominantly within
the right upper lobes, and also some in the lower lobes are
noted. These ill- defined areas may reflect an inflammatory
process, or less likely an atypical infectious etiology. There
is additionally, prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy as well.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  53 yo female with bipolar disorder tobacco abuse presents
with respiratory distress [**1-10**] atypical viral respiratory
infection + CHF + COPD.
.
# VIRAL RESPIRATORY INFECTION:  She had been coughing the day
prior to presentation and the ground glass opacities on CTA
would be consistent with an atypical viral infection.  Nasal
viral cultures were sent but were still pending at time of
discharge.  She does not have lobar pneumonia on imaging and had
been afebrile.  CTA did not show PE.  Legionella Ag was pending
at time of discharge.  She was initially 87% on room air in the
ED and was sent to the MICU for respiratory distress.  She
quickly improved with azithroymycin, IV solumedrol and combivent
nebs.  She was ambulating comfortably on room air at discharge.
.
# CHF: She has no documented history of CHF.  Echo on this
admission showed EF>55% with LVH.  She was diuresed with lasix
in the MICU with improvement.  She was euvolemnic at discharge.
.
# COPD: She has no documented history of COPD and has never had
pulmonary function tests.  Her ABG was 7.35/38/93 on 5L NC which
does not suggest that she is chronically retaining CO2.
However, she was wheezy on presentation which improved with
combivent nebs.  She was initially put on high dose IV steroids
for a supposed COPD flare but she improved quickly and was put
on a quick prednisone taper.  She will finish a 5 day course of
azithromycin.  She might benefit from outpatient follow up with
a pulmonologist and PFTs.  I have spoken to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] her PCP
and she will set her up with pulmonary clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 612**].
.
# ID: One of four blood cultures drawn in the ED grew coag neg
staph.  This was thought to be a contaminant.  Followup
surveillance cultures did not have growth to date at time of
discharge.  She remained afebrile although she had an initial
leukocytosis on presentation.  The leukocytosis was persistently
elevated [**1-10**] starting steroids.  She did not have sputum to
culture and her urine also showed no growth to date.
.
# BIPOLAR DISORDER: Pt is only on Risperdal 50mg IM every other
week on Fridays.  She goes to [**Hospital6 **] to see Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 6427**] for followup.  Her therapist is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who is also
at [**Hospital1 778**].
.
# Tobacco Abuse: Pt recently increased to 2ppd.  She was given
nicotine patches while she was in the hospital.
