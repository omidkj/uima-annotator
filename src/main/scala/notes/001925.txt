Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
63 year old Male with history of type 2 diabetes, CKD, who
presents with lethargy and hypotension. History of recent
admission (including MICU stay) in [**1-/2142**] indicated for
acidosis, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. Patient
presented to his outpatient physician today with altered mental
status and was discovered to have hypotension. Was subsequently
referred to the ED.

In the emergency department vitals were: T 97.8, HR 49, BP
93/46, RR 20, O2Sat 100% 2L NC. Patient had Cr up to 5.7 from
recent baseline of 2.8 at discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] in 3/[**2141**]. Also
with K up to 6.3 and EKG with peaked T waves. Received
kayexylate, insulin, and glucose. Also, due to relative
hypotension, was given Vancomycin and Zosyn. Patient received 4L
NS IVF in the ED. He had a U/A measured without any evidence of
UTI. CXR showed pulmonary vascular congestion, similar to prior
imaging. Head CT was without acute abnormality. Vitals prior to
transfer to the MICU were: T 96.1, HR 45, BP 107/56, RR 16,
O2Sat 100% 2L NC.

Upon arrival to the MICU patient reports some nausea, but denies
chest pain, thirst, dysuria.

Chest PA/Lateral:
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis. No new areas of focal
consolidation
identified.

Abdominal ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Increased resistive indices, with essentially no diastolic
flow identified on either the right or left. This is a
non-specific finding suggesting a broad differential of medical
renal disease.

ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate)
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate-to-severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved regional/global systolic function. Moderate diastolic
dysfunction with elevated PCWP. Right ventricular dilation and
dysfunction. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2142-3-30**]): No acute intracranial process.

RENAL U.S.; DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL ([**2142-3-30**]): No hydronephrosis.
Increased resistive indices, with essentially no diastolic flow
identified on either the right or left. This is a non-specific
finding suggesting a broad differential of medical renal
disease.



Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo M with history of diabetes, CKD, who presented with
lethargy and hypotension. Found to have increased Cr up to 5.7
from recent baseline of 2.8.

#. Acute Renal Failure, Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3:
- Patient with Cr up acutely to 5.7 after it had stabilized at
2.8 prior to [**1-/2142**] discharge from hospital. In past, [**Last Name (un) **] was
attributed to over-diuresis. Is possible that patient is again
over-diuresed, though given hypotension with lack of response to
4 L fluid resuscitation, will also consider that unintentional
overdose of home anti-hypertensives are contributing to poor
renal perfusion. No history of urinary retention or BPH in past
and patient had renal ultrasound that showed no evidence of
obstruction or hydronephrosis. Checked a serum osmolar gap which
was normal at 9.
- Patient's home furosemide and anti-hypertensives were
initially held. His FeUrea was 14% indicating pre-renal
etiology.  The renal team was consulted and the patient received
1L D5 with 3 amps HCO3 and 1 L NS for poor urine output.  The
renal team recommended no diuresis and found no indications for
urgent HD.  The patient's creatinine trended down to 5.3 before
he was called out from the medical ICU.
- On the floor, his renal function continued to improve, and was
back at baseline of 2.9 prior to discharge. Patient maintained
good urine output. Bilateral venous mapping of the upper
extremities were performed in preparation for potential
hemodialysis. Patient restarted on furosemide 40 mg po qd
(previously 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]) per renal consult recommendations.

#. Hyperkalemia:
Likely secondary to acute kidney injury as described above. Had
peaked T waves on precordial leads in ED and received insulin,
D50, and kayexylate. K improved from 6.3 to 5.8 with those
interventions in the ED.  Patient's potassium remained stable
throughout remainder of the hospital course.

#. Bradycardia / Hypotension:
- Patient with history of
