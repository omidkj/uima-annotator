N/V, lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2175-5-11**] HD line placement

History of Present Illness:
66 yo F w/ESRD s/p failed cadaveric renal Tx now on HD, recent
admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx PE, presents with
fever/malaise. She was recently admitted with staph epi HD line
infection, the decicion was made to treat her with vancomycin
through the line. She has been fatigued but been doing fairly
well for the last month until last week when her vanco course
was finished. Since this time she has been feeling worse with
intermittent mid-line back pain, night-sweats, and chills, no
cough. This AM she awoke feeling very poor, nauseated, vomiting
so presented to the ED.
.
In the ED her VS were T 100.6, BP 214/71, HR 82, RR 24, 96% on
RA
She immediately had blood cultures drawn and was given
vancomycin & zosyn. Her BP then trended down to the 80's as she
spiked a fever to 102.6. An attempt at a R fem-line was placed,
but without success. Her hypotension responded to 1.5L IVF
.
On presentation to the MICU she was complaining of back pain.
The pain was mid-line in the thoracic spine. She denied dysuria,
diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, or
light-headedness.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo woman with ESRD on HD with recent line sepsis who
presented with fever and back pain, either from line-related
bacteremia with likely related demand cardiac ischemia.
.
The patient was admitted to the MICU, where she was found to be
hyperkalemic, with a peak of 7.3 (ECG showed associated STE in
V2-V4, STD in II, III, AVF, with peaked T waves across the
precordium). Cardiology was called, and as this was thought to
be more consistent with hyperkalemia, the patient's heparin gtt
was discontinued. The patient was given calcium, kayexelate,
glucose, and insulin and her K decreased to 5.9.
.
Overnight, the patient developed SOB, profuse diaphoresis, and
left-sided chest pain. She was tachycardic and hypertensive to
170s. She was given Morphine 2mg, Ativan 0.5mg, and Nitro paste.
Her EKG at the time showed worsening STE with tachycardia.
Cardiology was again called, and at the time of assessment, the
patient was chest pain free and had no concerning changes on
ECG. CK peaked on [**5-11**] at 310. Cardiology again felt this to be
demand ischemia and recommended continued [**Month/Year (2) **], Heparin, BB and
eventual ACE.
.
On [**5-10**], the patient's old HD catheter was pulled, and IR placed
a temporary HD line in left femoral line. She was dialyzed [**5-11**].
She was also started on home dose steroids for hypotension.
Following HD line placement she had persistant bleeding that
continued despite redressing and pressure. Heparin drip was
stopped. Her bleeding stopped around 7AM on [**5-12**]. She was
transfused with 2 units PRBC.
.
She remains afebrile and has not had evidence of hemodynamic
instability since being in the ICU.
.
SUB-MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA: Patient with known coronary artery
disease and hypertrophic left ventrical.  In the setting of
sepsis, she had dynamic EKG changes including possible ST
elevations and cardiac enzyme leak concerning for anterior MI.
These were difficult to interpret however in the setting of QT
prolongation and significant variation in potassium levels.
Cardiac echo showed no focal wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac
enzymes trended down. Cardiology was consulted felt her cardiac
findings were likely due to demand-related submyocardial
ischemia in the setting of a hypertrophic ventrical.  She had
medical management for MI with [**Month/Year (2) **], beta-blocker, statin. She
had ~36 hours of heparin.  She was started on lisinopril on
[**5-13**].  No plavix or integralin was used, given bleeding risk.
.
ANEMIA: Patient had a fall in hematocrit concerning for acute
blood loss anemia following temporary HD line placement. IR
evaluated line in MICU and felt bleeding to be stablilized. She
has not had further bleeding. CT abdomen showed no evidence of
RP bleed.  She was transfused with 2 units of PRBCs with an
appropriate increase in hematocrit.
.
LINE SEPSIS: Patient's initial fevers and maliase are likely
from incompletely treated infection of her [**Month/Year (2) 2286**] catheter.
Her cultures have been negative since admission. No other source
of infection identified on CT or TTE.  She was treated with
Vancomycin.  Zosyn was added on initial presentation but stopped
on [**5-13**]. There was no evidence of endocarditis on echo.
Vancomycin was continued for 2 weeks from presentation given no
evidence of bacterial endocarditis and negative blood cultures.
.
BACK PAIN: Patient has chronic lower back pain and does not
appear to have been worse than baseline.  There was no evidence
of spine infection on non-contrast CT-abdomen.
.
ESRD: The patient was continued on a monday, wednesday, friday
[**Month/Year (2) 2286**] schedule during her hospitalization.
.
DIABETES: The patient was placed on glargine 15U at night with a
sliding scale insulin.  Her fingersticks were low-normal in the
morning 45-80 so her lantus was decreased to 13U and the sliding
scale continued.
.
HYPERTENSION: Controlled with beta-blocker and ACE.
.
HISTORY OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM: PE in [**1-30**].  During her
hospitalization she was anticoagulated on a heparin gtt until
her coumadin level became therapeutic. She was discharged with
an INR of 2.0.
