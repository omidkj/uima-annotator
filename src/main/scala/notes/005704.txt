Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary artery bypass graft x4:
1. Left internal mammary artery to the lateral branch of
    the left anterior descending artery.
2. Bypass from ascending aorta to the medial branch of the
    left anterior descending artery using reversed
    autologous saphenous vein graft.
3. Bypass from the ascending aorta sequential to the
    posterior descending artery branch of right coronary
    artery and then through the CA lateral branch of the
    right coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with past medical history
significant for coronary artery disease status post inferior
STEMI and bare metal stent to
the right coronary artery in [**2198-12-25**] complicated by
ventricular fibrillation.  The patient received an ICD in [**Month (only) **]
[**2198**].  The patient now presents for recurrent chest pain.
Stress test was abnormal in [**Month (only) **].  The patient underwent
ultimately left heart cath and coronary angiogram
which showed that he had 3-vessel disease.  Decision was made to
take the patient to the operating room for revascularization.
The decision with its risks, benefits and alternatives were
discussed with the patient and the patient
agreed to proceed.  A consent was signed and included in the
chart.

Pertinent Results:
TEE [**2200-6-25**]
Prebypass:
The left atrium is moderately enlarged. No mass/thrombus is seen
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal with thinning of
the inferior and inferolateral walls to 0.5 cm. The thinned wall
segments are also more brightly echogenic, consistent with scar
tissue. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Estimated EF 40-45%. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
mildly dilated in diameter with simple atherosclerotic plaque..
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

Postbypass:
Left ventricular function remains unchanged from prebypass,
estimated EF= 40-45%. Inferior and inferolateral all hypokinesis
appears unchanged. No apparent new wall motion abnormalities.

Mitral regurgitation remains trace. Other valvular function
remains unchanged. No evidence of aortic dissection.

Chest X-Ray [**2200-6-28**]
The lungs are hyperinflated and the diaphragms are flattened,
consistent with COPD.  The patient is status post sternotomy
with mediastinal clips.
Left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tip over the right
ventricle.
There is mild cardiomegaly and slight prominence of the
cardiomediastinal
silhouette, similar to [**2200-2-24**].  No CHF.  There are small
bilateral effusions, with underlying atelectasis, slighlty
larger.  Some pleural thickening at the left lung apex laterally
is unchanged. The lungs are otherwise grossly clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital after cardiac cath. She
was brought to the operating room on [**2200-6-25**] where the patient
underwent Left internal mammary artery to the lateral branch of
the left anterior descending artery. Bypass from ascending aorta
to the medial branch of the left anterior descending artery
using reversed autologous saphenous vein graft. Bypass from the
ascending aorta sequential to the
posterior descending artery branch of right coronary artery and
then through the CA lateral branch of the right coronary artery.

Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. First night
post-op he was hypotensive with marginal urine output, he
required a-pacing and Lopressor and Lasix were delayed 24hrs.
Chest tubes were removed without incident. He was transferred to
the floor in POD#1.  His ICD was interrogated by
electrophysiology no arrhythmia were found.  His beta-blockers
were restarted.  He was gently diuresed toward his preop weight.


The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged home with [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18681**] in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
