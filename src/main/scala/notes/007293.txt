Brief Hospital Course:
Post trauma course c/b ARF, shock liver, ARDS, diffuse ? drug
skin rash w/ desquamation, VRE bacteremia, EColi UTI, coag
negative staph bacteremia.

Respiratory failure: On HD 1, the patient developed respiratory
distress and ABG showed pCO2 73 and a ph 7.12.  The patient was
intubated emergently by anesthesia. The pt subsequently
developed pneumonia and was treated appropriately.  The patient
was unable to tolerate a ventilator wean and underwent an open
tracheostomy on [**1-5**].

Recurrent fevers: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course included, VRE
bacteremia, Coag neg staph bacteremia, staph pneumonia, and a
highly resistent Ecoli UTI. An ID consult was obtained. The
patient had a thorough fever evaluation including a RUQ US (neg
for cholecystitis), B LENI's (neg for DVT), and a TEE (neg for
endocarditis). The patient was treated appropriately for each
infection and the patient was afebrile  for > 48 hours upon
discharge.  Upon discharge, the patient was day 4 of 7 of
linezolid for staph line sepsis.  The pt's CVL was DC'd on [**1-18**]
and was DC'd with peripheal access only.

Renal:  The pt developed acute renal failure shortly after being
admitted.  A renal consult was obtained and pt was treated
conservatively with lasix and the avoidance of nephrotoxic
medications.  With time, the pt's creatine came down from a
maximum of 5.3 to 1.5 on discharge.  The patient was never
oliguric and was never dialyzed.  The pt was diagnosed with ATN
secondary to hypovolemia and hypotension associated with his
intial trauma.

Nutrition:  Pt is tolerating goal tubefeeds via a lap assisted G
tube placed on [**1-5**].

Endo:  The patient required a high dose insulin ggt for the
first half of the hospital course.  After his sepsis was
treated, his FS became managable vis a sliding scale.

Skin: After being started on zosyn at the being of the hospital
stay, the patient developed a diffuse, desquamating skin rash.
Dermatology was consulted and skin biopsies were performed.  The
pathology was consistent with an allergic type reaction, most
likely as a result of medications.  The presumptive diagnosis
was an allergic reaction to zosyn.  The patient's skin
re-epithelialized and returned to baseline upon dischrage.

Prophylaxis:  Given the pt's ortho injuries, immobility and
obesity, the pt was started on Lovenox and a pneumoboot to his
LLE.
