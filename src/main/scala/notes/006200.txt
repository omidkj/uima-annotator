History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] is a 58 year old man with history of
diabetes, ESRD on HD (anuric), CAD s/p MI, CHF (EF 30%),
a-fib/flutter and substance abuse(tobacco, EtOH, and crack
cocaine) who presents with p/w melena x2 days, and weakness as
well as increased dyspnea on exertion. He also states that he
has "throbbing" left sided chest pain that has been ongoing for
days-episodes come on all of a suddent and can last for hours,
usually. He missed his HD appointment for dialysis yesterday [**2-15**]
fatigue. He also complains of a productive cough with white
sputum for several days. He denies N/V/D and did not take any of
his medications on the day of presentation. He states he was on
antibiotics for the flu last week. He reports that his back is
pruritic. He notes recent cocaine use in the past two days.
.
In the ED his vitals were; T97.6, HR 106, BP 135/81, RR18, O2
96%
His labs were significant for Hct 22 (down from his baseline of
26)and he was guaiac positive on physical exam. He received 2U
of PRBCs. While in the ED his HR increased to the 140s
intermittently, he denied cp at that time, he received
metoprolol 25mg po times one as well as a 5mg IV dose. He was
given IV dilaudid for lower abdominal pain with good effect and
admitted to the MICU for lower GI bleed. He was seen by
nephrology in the ED
.
He has had an extensive workup in the past including (at least)
eight endoscopies-most recently in [**2154-8-14**], three
colonoscopies-last one in [**2153**], one enteroscopy, and a capsule
camera study-in [**2153**]; all studies have been negative with the
exception of small AVM's in the duodenum seen and cauterized on
one study, as well as minor jejunal erosions noted on the
capsule camera study. During his last admission (end of
[**Month (only) 359**]), he required 7 units of pRBC's.

Brief Hospital Course:
#) DOE-Symptoms started several days prior to admission and
differential included  volume overload from CHF or renal
failure, PNA as seen on CXR, ischemia or most likely anemia.  Pt
was given 2 units of prbcs with improvement in his symptoms.
There was an intial concern for pneumonia but pt was afebrile,
no elevation in his WBC but did have a cough.  He was not given
any antibiotics for this.  Pt ruled out for MI and was monitored
on telemetry with no events.  He did not require any additional
transfusions.

.
#) Melena-Pt states he has had black stools for 4 days, Hct is
not far below baseline, rectal exam in ED was guaiac positive.
He has had an EGD as recently as [**8-21**] that showed small AVMs,
had two bm's that were guaiac negative this am, hct has been
stable-not much of a decrease from baseline. He was given 2 U
prbcs with improvement in his Hct; and he subsequently remained
near his baseline of 29-30. Pt was given Protonix daily and no
other further intervention felt necessary per GI as he has had
numerous colonscopies and EGDs in the past.
.
#) Anemia. Most likely acute blood-loss anemia from a GI source,
as well as chronic anemia from CRI.  He recieved 2 Units while
in the hospital with stabilization of his anemia to baseline.
Per GI there were no further interventions done.
.
#) ESRD on HD-Pt was seen during his hospitalization by renal.
He received HD while in house.  He also had an AV Fistulogram on
[**3-10**] with successful balloon angioplasty of the mid cephalic
vein and the more central cephalic stenosis using the 6 mm
cutting balloon and a 4 mm regular balloon.  Renal followed pt
during his stay and felt he could go home with his regular HD
schedule.  He was [**Month/Year (2) 1988**] for dialysis the day after admission
(Tues) at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9449**] Dialysis Center
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 84701**].  [**Location (un) 669**], [**Numeric Identifier 18406**].

.
#) Hyperkalemia-Likely secondary to renal failure and he
received kayexalate in the ED with improvement in his K. No
further treatment needed beyond his routine HD.

.
#) CAD: Pt had CE drawn which showed Troponin of 0.34, 0.39 on
this admission, no EKG changes concerning for ischemia felt to
be likely [**2-15**] demand in the setting of renal failure. No further
enzymes done; his aspirin was intially held in the setting of a
bleed but restarted once stable.  He was continued on his home
labetolol, lisinopril and atorvastatin.

.
#) Rhythm-h/o a-fib a-flutter not anticoagulated [**2-15**] GIB, in ED
was in rapid a-fib/a-flutter, on labetalol 200mg po bid at home,
has been well rate controlled while here.  He was continued and
discharged on his regular home medications.

.
#) Substance abuse-Pt was put in a CIWA scale while in house but
it was not felt he was in withdrawal during this
hospitalization.

.
#) Diabetes.  Pt was continued on home insulin regimen.
