pressures of 45/16 and the patient was referred for mitral
valve repair versus replacement with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

no apparent deficits.  The pulmonary examination revealed
that his lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Coronary examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Sternal incision was clean with Steri-Strips clean, dry, and
intact.  His abdomen was benign.  His extremities were warm
