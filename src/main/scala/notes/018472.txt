intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 2520**] is a 82 yo woman with COPD (FEV1 0.92, 66% predicted)
with a h/o hypercarbic respiratory failure s/p intubation x2 and
trach x1 (now decanulated), hypertension and DM2 who developed
worsening SOB last night with cough. She went to her PCPs
office, was found to be in respiratory distress with O2 sats in
the 80-90% range. She received 2 nebs, and was sent to the ED by
EMS.
.
In the ED, her initial VSs were HR 70 BP 198/88 RR 40 94% neb.
Noted to be lethargic, SOB with audible wheezes and 3+ edema to
knees b/l. Received albuterol-ipratropium neb x2,
methylprednisolone 80mg, azithromycin 500 mg, ceftriaxone 1 gm,
Mg 2gm. Foley placed. ABG 7.19/118/72.
.
The pt was placed on BIPAP and sent to the MICU for further
management.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, she was somnolent, so no further
history was obtainable.
.
Per the pt's daughter, the pt ahd been complaining of fatigue
for the past couple of weeks, at which time she stopped
quetiapine. Over the last four days, the pt's shortness of
rbeath significantly worsened.

Past Medical History:
- Respiratory failure: Admitted to BIMDC in [**1-14**] after cardiac
arrest, presumed to be secondary respiratory failure. She had a
tracheostomy at that time. She was decannulated on [**2167-6-19**] and
tolerated the procedure well. Had another admission [**Date range (1) 18088**]/07
with hypercarbic respiratory failure and brief intubation,
thought due to oversedation with ambien, and probable underlying
obesity hypoventilation syndrone and obstructive sleep apnea
- Hypertension
- Type 2 Diabetes
- Lymphoma, s/p chemotherapy several years ago and s/p XRT [**11-12**]
(unclear where radiation was targeted to) - followed at [**Hospital1 2025**]
- Glaucoma
- Cataracts, baseline anisocoria (R pupil)

Social History:
Lives at home with her daughter, at baseline very active. No
tobacco/EtOH/illicits currently. Receives medical care primarily
from B&W and [**Hospital1 2025**].

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2168-5-10**] 2:48 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with COPD, OSA, admitted with hypercarbic resp
failure, COPD exacerbation
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for interval change
HISTORY: COPD, admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-9**], the various
tubes have been removed. Bilateral pleural effusions persist,
substantially more prominent on the right. Retrocardiac
opacification is again seen, consistent with atelectasis. The
possibility of supervening basilar pneumonia cannot be excluded.

No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.

DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1569**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11006**]
Approved: TUE [**2168-5-10**] 8:48 AM

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic
respiratory failure was thought to be secondary to a combination
of obesity hyperventilation syndrome, oversedation from
seroquel/tylenol PM, and a possible COPD flare with possible
retrocardiac infiltrates on imaging reflecting a PNA.  The
patient was started on pulse steroids and
ceftriaxone/azithromycin for CAP.  Despite these measures the
patient continued to be hypercarbic and on HD #2 required
intubation.  After 48 hours the ventilator was successfully
weaned. She continued on CPAP while sleeping and was sent to the
floor for further management. She was satting well on RA on the
floor with good airmovement.  Her ambulatory saturation stayed
between 90 and 95%.  She was sent out with
instructions/prescriptions to finish a total 7 day course of
antibiotics (azithromycin changed to PO, ceftriaxone change to
cefpodoxime PO) and to steroid taper per her PCP's instruction.
She was arranged a close PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] pulmonology
follow-up in one month.

# DM2: As her home dose of NPH was unknown upon admission, 20 U
qday was given with RISS.  Her BG ranged from 100s to 300s
during her stay and was likely exacerbated by her steroids.
Upon discharge, her home dose of NPH was still unclear, though
her daughter thought it was 40 U qAM and roughly 28 U qPM.  She
was given instructions to take 40 U qAM starting on the day
after discharge, check her BG at least 3x per day (she was
already checking at home), call her PCP/coverage for any BG >
300, call PCP on day after discharge to ensure doses and
formulate plan, and follow-up with PCP for scheduled appointment
4 days after discharge.  Pt and daughter were counseled on signs
of hypoglycemia, to check BG if she experienced any of them, and
to call PCP/coverage or go to ED if low.  They were agreeable to
the plan.

# Hypertension: The patient's metoprolol was discontinued out of
concern for bronchospasm.  She was started on an acei with good
control.  She was discharged on 5mg lisinopril, which can be
titrated up prn, and her home lasix dose.

# Hypercholesterolemia: Simvastatin 20.

# Code status: The patient was full code during her stay and
required intubation.  However, after extubation she went back
and forth regarding her code status.  She should have her code
status clarified with both her primary care doctor and her
daughter as an outpatient.
