History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 44 yo female with a h/p Crohn's, recent PE on
coumadin, HTN, and depression who presents with abd pain and
diarrhea, c/w Crohn's flare.  Pt was recently hospitalized
[**Date range (1) 29493**] for similar symptoms.  She was started on
colestipol, levo/flagyl, prednisone 40mg and underwent a
sigmoidoscopy with biopsy showed which showed cryptitis in the
colon. Patient was started on a prednisone taper, currently on
15mg qd (has longstanding hx of prednisone intake), with report
of flares when tapered. Patient has been having [**7-17**] loose,
non-bloody BMs per day, with worsening abd pain over past 4
days.  Two days prior to admit, patient noted blood in her
stools, which is new for pt.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VSS, T 98.1 BP 144/69 HR 87 RR 16 100% RA.
Abdominal CT showed ileitis.  Surgery evaluated the patient and
felt there was no indication for surgical intervention. Received
3gm IV unasyn x1, dilaudid 1mg IV x2, morphine 4mg IV x1, zofran
4mg IV x1, and 125mg solumedrol.
.
On the floor, the patient's pain was controlled.  She had
continued stooling with blood streaking, and passed "large"
blood clots. She had stable hemodynamics on floor with sbp 130s,
2 PIVs in place. Received 1uFFP and vitamin K IV. GI contact[**Name (NI) **],
plan for possible scope in AM. Transferred to MICU for
hemodynamic monitoring.
.
In the MICU, the patient received 4 U RBCs.  She also developed
a rash on her upper torso, which was believed to be due to
Cipro.  Her Cipro was discontinued, and she was continued on
Levo.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 44 year old female with Crohn's disease, recent
PE on Coumadin, HTN, and depression who was admitted for
abdominal pain and diarrhea.
.
# Crohn's Disease:  The patient presented with worsening
abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in her stools in the setting
of tapering steroids prior to admission.  An abdominal CT
performed on admission showed persistent thickening and
peri-inflammatory changes of a long segment of distal small
bowel, with no evidence of intra-abdominal fluid collections or
abscess.  Her symptoms and radiological findings were most
consistent with a Crohn's flare.  She was started on IV
steroids, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, and continued on
Colazal.  She subsequently developed a drug rash to
levofloxacin, which was thus discontinued (see below).  Her
abdominal pain and diarrhea improved substantially during this
admission.  On [**12-18**], she had a colonoscopy, which revealed
ulceration, granularity, friability, erythema and congestion in
the terminal ileum.  Biopsies were performed, which showed
active ileitis with focal ulceration, with no evidence of CMV.
She will be started on Remicade as an outpatient, and she was
discharged on a five week course of oral steroids.
.
# Bright red blood per rectum:  After admission, the patient
continued to have BRBPR in the setting of a supratherapeutic
INR.  She received 4 U RBCs and 1 dose of IV vitamin K, and was
transferred to the MICU for closer hemodynamic monitoring.  She
had a GI Bleeding study, which showed no evidenc
