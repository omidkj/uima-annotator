Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for Intracranial hemorrhage


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
Percutaneous IVC filter placement
Bronchoscopy
Central Venous Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
39 yo male with h/o C5/6 traumatic injury with
quadriplegia in [**2102**] and complicated by recurrent UTIs, DVTs,
PNAs, and he is s/p IVC filter who presents from OSH with a left
putamenal ICH.

On admission, he was somnolent and unable to give any history.
His PCA then noted at night that his normal speech had become
dysarthric. He was still somewhat awake and alert. When cleaning
him, she noted a right facial droop and weakness of his
minimally functional right side.  He went to the OSH and was
found to have O2 sats in the 80s and by report a fever, although
there is only documentation of normal temp.  He was given Zosyn
for possible resp problem.  [**Name (NI) **] then had head CT which showed
2.2x2.6x5 cm left basal ganglia bleed.  At that time, he was
apparently sleepy, but alert and making decisions well.  He
initially refused transfer to [**Location (un) 86**] and refused surgery.  He
also said he would want resuscitation, but not intubation and
recounted that he was on a chronic vent in the past.  He did not
sign anything formally, but the MD there did indicate this on
the [**Hospital3 **] documentation.  He was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**].
INR was found to be 1.9 as he is on coumadin for DVT ppx.  He
got dilantin 1 g, ativan 1 mg, and Zosyn at the OSH.
.
On admission, he was much more somnolent and not able to answer
any
questions.  He constantly fell asleep during examination.  He
also has BP of Systolic in the 95 range.  this then normalized
to
the 150 range with IVFs.
.
MICU Transfer:
On [**2111-10-25**], called by primary Neuro team for increasing
respiratory distress though to be secondary to LLL PNA (? CAP or
aspiration PNA). Patient was given an IV on [**10-24**] and this was
his first dose of Levofloxacin as well as Vancomycin. This was
delayed due to the patient's reluctance to have the IV placed.
The patient has been having increased O2 requirements since
[**10-22**] and has currently progressed to 100% non-rebreather. He
has required more frequent suctioning and an escalation of
nursing needs. He has been having low grade fevers and spiked to
102.
.
On [**10-24**], the patient was assess by Psychiatry and found to be
delirious, and as such with limited decision making capacity. On
examining the patient today, he knows his name, his location,
but does not know the date. His response to other questions is
incomprehensible at times and non-sensical at other times. Given
his previous reluctance for escalation of care in the recent
past, the legal department at [**Hospital1 18**] was consulted who clarfied
that in his current delirious state, his capacity for decisions
was reduced and as such, his HCP (mother) would be the person to
help guide his decision making. In speaking to her, she states
that it would be reasonable to transfer him to the ICU for
escalated nursing care and for more frequent suctioning. But she
states that in the event that he does not improve and he starts
to suffer, that we should try to make him comfortable. She
maintained that he should not be intubated, consistent with his
DNI status.
.
ROS: Patient unable.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2111-10-20**] 5:59 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: More lethargic

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
39 year old man with Head bleed from osh
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
More lethargic
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Intracranial hemorrhage, now more lethargic.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: No prior for comparison. An
intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the left lentiform
nucleus measures 24 x 29 mm in greatest axial dimension, with
surrounding edema. No extension into the lateral ventricles is
identified. There is no hydrocephalus. The hemorrhage exerts
some mass effect, however, there is negligible shift of septum
pellucidum to the right. No acute major vascular territorial
infarct is identified, though evaluation of the inferior cranial
structures is somewhat limited due to motion. No fractures are
seen. Imaged sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION: Left lentiform nucleus intraparenchymal hemorrhage
with very mild mass effect. No extraaxial hemorrhage seen.
