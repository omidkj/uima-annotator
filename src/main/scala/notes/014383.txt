Imaging/Procedures:
.
Cardiac Cath [**2113-1-20**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.
The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA had no angiographically apparent
flow-limiting disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated left-sided
filling pressure with a mean PCWP of 19mmHg and prominent
v-waves to 27mmHg. RVEDP was normal at 7mmHg.  There was mild
pulmonary hypertension with a PA pressure of 34/11mmHg.
Systemic arterial pressures were low at 77/55mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent coronary disease.
2. Elevated left-sided filling pressure.
3. Low systemic arterial pressures.
.
CXR [**2113-1-20**]: Findings suggesting mild vascular congestion.
Calcified lymphadenopathy suggestive of prior granulomatous
exposure.

Brief Hospital Course:
61-year-old male with history of mitral valve prolapse and
moderate regurgitation who presented with worsening dyspnea and
was found to have worsening regurgitation which was now severe.
He was taken to cath lab which was notable for clean coronaries
and elevated wedge pressure. Given the severity fo his disease,
the cardiac surgerical service was consulted. On [**2113-1-23**] Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he underwent a
minimally invasive repair of his mitral valve with closure of a
patent foramen ovale. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next few hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. On postoperative day one, he was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. He was started
on betablockade and lisinopril which he is tolerating well. He
has remained hemodynamically stable. PW and CT'w were remove in
timely fashion and without incident. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with her postoperative
strength and mobility. At the time of discharge rigth sided CT
site was draining small to moderate amount of serosang drainage.
He was discharged with dressing in place. All patients questions
and concerns addressed. Discharge instructions revieved.
