Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2758**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxic respiratory failure, septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement on [**9-6**] and [**2123-9-9**]. Failed
thoracentesis on [**9-21**].


History of Present Illness:
80 y/o male with complicated past medical history of COPD,
atrial fibrillation, ileus, abdominal abscess status post
drainage, and C-difficile infection, who was initially admitted
to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**8-31**] for hyponatremia. Per discussion with the
hospitalist there, patient had a PEG tube placed for FTT. He was
on ciprofloxacin and tigacycline and required ICU transfer for
hypotension and septic shock, and was on levophed and dopamine.
A CVL was placed, and antibiotics were changed to imipenem and
vancomycin. A urine culture was positive for ESBL Ecoli on
[**2123-8-31**]. Patient's code status was changed from DNR/DNI to
full code after discussing goals of care with patient's wife.

Patient remained with a clinical picture of septic shock,
improved for one day, but then developed hypoxic respiratory
failure. X-ray was felt to be consistent with multifocal
pneumonia and CHF/volume overload, for which lasix x 2 was
attempted. Patient was reportedly agitated and pulled out his
PICC line and femoral CVL line. A PIV x 1 was placed.

For his shortness of breath, lasix, morphine, and solumedrol
were initiated. [**Name (NI) **] wife reports that goals of care are
still full code. An ABG was 7.21/39/77/92% on 100% NRB. Bipap
was attempted, but patient was still with labored breathing, and
intubation was performed. ETT position was checked prior to
transfer and was in adequate position. Patient's ventilator
settings are AC 440 x 16 x 88% FIO2 x 5 PEEP on transfer.

On transfer, VS: BP 160/100, HR 107, 96% for oxygenation.
Propofol was initiated. Access is only 1 PIV. Per report,
further attempt at access was not successful. The patient was
intubated and sedated on arrival.

Microbiology:

Imaging:
 - [**2123-9-6**] Chest Xray: The endotracheal tube now terminates 4.5
cm from the carina. An enteric tube terminates in the stomach. A
right internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC. There
has been interval improvement in aeration bilaterally, right
greater than left, but alveolar and interstitial opacities
compatible with edema persist. Lung bases remain hyperinflated,
with small bilateral pleural effusions. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged. IMPRESSION: 1. Supporting devices as
described. 2. Interval improvement in pulmonary edema, now
moderate. 3. Unchanged small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions.
 - [**2123-9-6**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the anterior septum and anterior wall. The
lateral wall is mildly hypokinetic. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent
with LAD ischemia/infarction. Calcified aortic valve without
significant stenosis.

[**2123-9-9**] CT Chest notable findings: 1. Bilateral upper lobe
bronchovascular ground-glass infiltrates, this is most likely
due to bilateral upper lobe pneumonia or aspiration, hemorrhage
and pulmonary edema are considered less likely.  2. A renal
ultrasound is suggested to evaluate possible left hydroureter.

[**2123-9-10**] Renal Ultrasound notable findings: No evidence of
hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or stones.  Previously seen left
hydroureter has now resolved, possibly secondary to Foley
placement in the bladder.

[**2123-9-18**] CT Chest notable findings: 1. No intra-abdominal
abscess. 2. Interval near-complete resolution of right pleural
effusion. Interval increase of small-to-moderate on the left. 3.
Normal aeration of the right lung without focal consolidations.
4. Subtotal collapse of the left lower lobe with loculated
pleural effusion.  Superimposed infectious process cannot be
excluded. 5. Bilateral severe hydronephrosis extending to the
UVJs but without definite obstructive mass. Could represent
chronic reflux from a full bladder. 6. Tiny pockets of
intravesicular air in the anti-dependent portion of the bladder.
If the patient has no recent instrumentation, differential
diagnosis of emphysematous cystitis must be considered. 7. A 1.3
cm right hyperdense renal cyst, better characterized in the
previous ultrasound study. 8. Tiny urinary bladder stones.

[**2123-9-23**] Renal Ultrasound notable findings:Interval development
of bilateral symmetric moderate hydronephrosis involving both
kidneys. Foley catheter in the bladder outlet and likely not
functioning properly.

[**2123-9-24**] Portable chest X-ray: Cardiac size is normal. Collapse
of the left lower lobe is stable. Mild left pleural effusion has
minimally increased in amount. The right lung is clear with no
pneumothorax. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5655**] is an 80 M with a medical history notable for COPD,
congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, recent
G-tube placement for failure to thrive, and recurrent urinary
tract infections who was transferred from an outside hospital to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for urosepsis.

He initially was intubated and on pressors. He required
treatment for urosepsis (OSH cultures grew ESBL E coli), COPD,
health-care associated pneumonia (culture negative), and CHF
with reduced LVEF. He eventually improved and was extubated on
[**9-8**]. However, he required transfer back to the ICU for flash
pulmonary edema a few days later.

He was eventually transferred back to the floor and treated for
the above conditions. He continued to have episodes of
hypotension and respiratory distress and was found to have a
leukocytosis and suspected empyema. This was unable to be
drained by thoracentesis and the patient declined additional
invasive procedures. He stabilized but did not improve on
broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other active issues during this time
included frequent episodes of flash pulmonary edema, delirium,
and anxiety.
