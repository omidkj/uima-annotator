History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 11753**] is a 68 year old man with past medical history
significant for COPD, CLL, Hypertension, and recent admission
for pulmonary embolus complicated by respiratory failure,
intubation and a ventillator associated pneumonia, presenting
from home with weakness, tremmor and fatigue and now found to
have GPC bacteremia.

Patient reports progressive weakness for the past two days, but
most concerning to him is bilateral upper extremity tremmor. He
has never had this in the past, it is not associated with any
numbness or tingling and is present all day. Patient had recent
hospital acquired pneumonia, treated until [**2185-4-2**] with
Vanc/Cefepime, however now he feels his breathing is much
improved. At time of discharge from the hospital he had a 2
liter oxygen requirement.  He does however report some low grade
fevers at rehab (~99.0) Of note, he was recently started on
Trazodone and Celexa 40mg daily. Denies any cough or sputum
production, has been active and able to ambulate with PT at
rehab.  At the time of discharge from rehab he had a 2L oxygen
requirement.

In the ED, initial VS were: 99.8 96 122/68 16 99% (2-3L ? vs
RA). Patient was given Aspirin, morphine chronic neck pain, NS
at 125/hr and admitted for further managmeent.
Vitals on admission were HR 100 111/74 15 99%3L

On the floor, had A. Fib with RVR in 120's.  Increased
metoprolol to 125 [**Hospital1 **] from 100.  This afternoon patient growing
GPC's in blood (likely strep).  got 250cc bolus at that point
with BP in 90's systolic.  HR increased to 130's with systolic
BP in mid 80's.  Got further 500cc's, and BP improved to mid
90's.  HR still 110 so go another 500cc bolus.  Following that
patient with increasing respiratory distress with requiring NRB
for oxygenation.  Given nebulizers but lasix held given
hypotension earlier.  Now asked for ICU transfer for increasing
oxygen requirement.  Vanco/zosyn given on the floor.

At time of ICU evaluation patient with RR 24-26 on 5L via face
mask and c/o shortness of breath.  On arrival to ICU satting in
mid 90'd on 2L NC with stable BP of 110.

IMAGES/STUDIES:

[**2185-4-13**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 90.
RSR' pattern in leads V1-V2 with a QRS duration of 84. ST-T wave
changes in leads II, III, aVF and V3-V5. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2185-3-20**] no diagnostic interval change.

[**2185-4-13**] CXR: FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest are
obtained. There has been interval removal of the PICC line and
left IJ central venous catheter. Comparison is also made with a
CT chest from [**2185-3-20**]. Extensive centrilobular and paraseptal
emphysema is better assessed on prior CT, though accounts for
the lucency in the upper lungs, primarily in the left
paramediastinal region. The heart is enlarged. The coarsened
interstitial markings are compatible with known underlying
COPD/emphysema. There is likely a stable small right pleural
effusion. There is no definite sign of new consolidation.
Mediastinal contour is stable. The osseous structures are
intact. IMPRESSION: 1. Chronic interstitial lung disease
secondary to emphysema with prominent paraseptal emphysema
accounting for left upper lobe lucency. 2. Cardiomegaly.

[**2185-4-14**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation at a rate of 112. Compared to
tracing #1 no diagnostic interval change.

[**2185-4-14**] ECG: Marked baseline artifact. The rhythm is probably
atrial fibrillation. Poor R wave progression in leads V1-V3.
ST-T wave changes in leads II, III, aVF and leads V2-V4.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2
