HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old gentleman
with a history significant for coronary artery disease,
status post CABG times four in [**2147**], status post DDD,
pacemaker placement in [**2155-7-27**], negative Persantine mibi
test in [**2155-7-27**] and recent catheterization of his heart on
[**2155-10-8**] showing an EF of 38%, three vessel disease, moderate
aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate
[**Date Range 16631**] and diastolic ventricular dysfunction, CHF, insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and GI bleed with a recent admission
between [**10-4**] and [**10-9**] for shortness of breath.  The patient
was discharged home on Lasix and now returns with increasing
shortness of breath on exertion, greater than right, no chest
pain, no nausea, vomiting, some abdominal pain, some
lightheadedness and fatigue, no orthopnea, no PND, slight
headache and decreased appetite.  Patient's stools are
chronically dark.

In the Emergency Room the patient was found to be guaiac
positive and with a blood pressure of 74/39, pulse of 80.  He
was started on Dopamine drip and given one liter of IV
fluids.  His urine output was 1.2 liters in 6 hours.  The
Dopamine was started at 5 mcg/kg/min. and then decreased to
2.5 mcg/kg/min. and then stopped, but his blood pressure did
not tolerate this and dropped to 68/49 so he was restarted on
the drip at 5 mcg/kg/minute.  After he was transferred to the
unit, right radial A line was placed, PA catheter was floated
through his right IJ and initial pressures were CVP of 14, RV
of 78/20, PA 60/25, wedge pressure of 33, PVR was calculated
3.3.  Cardiac index 3.03, cardiac output 7, SVR between 500
to 800 on Dopamine drip.  The patient was started on
Dobutamine drip in the CCU on the night of admission but his
blood pressure dropped within 20 minutes and this was stopped
and he remained on only the Dopamine drip.  He was also given
two units of packed red blood cells on the night of admission
with Lasix after each unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Coronary artery disease status post
CABG times four in [**2147**], status post DDD pacemaker placement

anterolateral hypokinesis, apical dyskinesis, inferior
akinesis, 3+ mitral regurgitation and aortic calcification.

moderate MR, TR and 45% EF with moderate AS.  3) Insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus diagnosed in [**2132**].  4) Recurrent
gastrointestinal bleed with extensive work-up including

diverticulosis and GI hemorrhoids.  He is H. pylori negative.
EGD in [**2155-5-27**] and [**2155-9-27**] showed Barrett's esophagus

vascular calcifications and he recently had admission on
[**9-27**] through [**2155-10-1**] for GI bleed leading to
orthostasis.  He also has a possible history of porcelain
gallbladder.  5) Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin in the past,
now with pacemaker in place and on Amiodarone.  6)
Hypertension.  7) Hypercholesterolemia.  8) Peptic ulcer
