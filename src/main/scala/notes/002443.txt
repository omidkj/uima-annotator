Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 18627**] is a 60 year old female with a hx of DM2, HTN, and CVA
who presents with dyspnea x 3 days. Pt states that her symptoms
began acutely on Sunday evening when she was lying supine. She
stated that she has previously never had similar symptoms. She
states that her shortness of breath is worse at night when she
lays down and is relieved with sitting up. This AM, she was
noted at her PCP's office to be in afib with RVR (140s) and also
had TWI in lateral leads that were new.
.
In the ED, VS were BP 108/72 HR 115 O2sat 95%RA. Given her RVR,
patient recieved IV dilt 10mg x 4 and dilt 30mg po. Her HR
decreased to the 110s and she remained HD stable during the
entire episode. Patient also had SOB and chest pressure in the
ED and responded to nitro. In addition, the patient received a
dose of cipro for a positive UA, though she denies dysuria. She
was also found to be in ARF with a Cr of 1.4 (b/l 0.8) and
received 2L of NS. However, her BNP was later found to be
significantly elevated to 7600.
.
Pt was initially admitted to the floor. She was initially rate
controlled with PO Metoprolol and IV Lopressor with 1 dose of
Diltiazem. In addition a Bedside ECHO done (given low voltage on
EKG, ? muffled heart sounds and possible concern for pericardial
ffusion)-->showed EF 15% that was new and no evidence of
effusion. In addition, her BP remained low 70-80s and thus
decision made to transfer to CCU for closer monitoring and
inotropic support with dobutamine.
.
Patient denies having any recent colds, but admits to allergies
associated with rhinorrhea and watery eyes.
.
Denies fever or chills. Admits to nausea and vomiting. No
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No melena or BRBPR.

ECHO [**12-11**]:
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =15-20 %). Transmitral Doppler
imaging is consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic
dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe global biventricular systolic dysfunction.
Elevated filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: 60 year old female with a hx of DM2, HTN, and CVA
who presents with dyspnea x3 days, AFib, and new dilated CM with
EF 15-20%.
.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Patient presented in a. fib with RVR and
was managed in the ED with IV and po diltiazem, though she
required high doses of each.  On the floor, she again became
tachycardic with afib with RVR and was given IV and po
lopressor.  A bedside ECHO was performed for concern of
pericaditis, as the patient had low voltage on her EKG and there
was some concern that she may have had a pericardial effusion.
The study revealed acute, decomponsated CHF, with a dilated
cardiomyopathy and an EF of 15%, compared to a baseline EF of
56% on [**5-14**].  She also became hypotensive with SBPs in the 80s
and was transferred to the CCU. It was thought that she had
received too much negatively inotropic medication.
In the CCU, the patient was started on dobutamine gtt with goal
SBP > 100.  This [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was rapidly weaned.  TEE was done which
did not reveal any [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] or echo contrast. Therefore,
cardioversion was attempted. However, this failed.  She was
started on amio and lisinopril were started.  Dig was
subsequently added for further rate control.  Carvedilol was up
titrated and she was started on coumadin for anticoagulation.

#CHF, systolic, new diagnosis: Stable. Patient's BPs when she
reached the CCU was 60-80s systolic. On exam, patient's lungs
were CTAB, 12 cm JVD, cool extremities, c/w cardiogenic shock.
Patient's BPs have been low, likely compounded with AFib with
RVR. The pt briefly required pressors, but was off dobutamine by
the morning following admission. Pt was started on a lasix drip
and diuresed well and was transitioned to stable lasix dose. Sx
of hf and pressor requirement resolved completely.
.
# Dilated Cardiomyopathy:  Though the etiology of the patient's
dilated CMP cannot be determined definitively, her toxicology
screen was found to be positive for cocaine and she endorses
ETOH use.  Of note, the patient's ECHO did not show evidence of
amyloid and her iron studies and TSH were all normal, with the
exception of an elevated ferritin. Viral studies have been
negative: HIV, CMV, EBV (Igm neg).
.
# ARF: Patient was found to be in ARF with a Cr that peaked at
2.0 compared to a b/l of 0.8.  Pt was thought to be prerenal
from poor systolic function and Cr decreased to 1.4 by the time
of discharge.
.
# UTI: Positive UA. Started on cipro in ED for ?UTI,
asymptomatic. Urine sample contaminated with ep
