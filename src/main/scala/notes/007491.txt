HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known firstname 72073**] [**Known lastname 93554**] is a
68-year-old woman with a history of rheumatic fever and

replacement.

She had undergone a cardiac catheterization in [**2144-8-9**] that revealed normal coronaries, moderate mistral
stenosis, and mild mitral regurgitation, as well as mild
diastolic ventricular dysfunction, with moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  She is being admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] at this time for anticoagulation with heparin
so that she can come off of her Coumadin in preparation for a
mitral valve replacement by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Rheumatic fever.
2.  Atrial fibrillation; status post permanent pacemaker.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Appendectomy.
2.  Pacemaker.
3.  Mitral valve replacement.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Digoxin 0.25 once per day.
 2.  Coumadin 5 mg once per day (she stopped on [**3-3**]).
 3.  Neurontin 300 mg twice per day.
 4.  Potassium 20 mEq twice per day.
 5.  Lipitor 10 mg once per day.
 6.  Aldactone 25 mg once per day.
 7.  Glucophage 850 mg three times per day.
 8.  Glyburide 5 mg twice per day.
 9.  Lasix 120 mg once per day.
10.  Ferrous sulfate 325 mg once per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with three children.
She lives with her husband.  She denies tobacco use.
Occasional ethanol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In general, in no
acute distress.   Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed pupils were equally round and reactive
to light, anicteric.  The neck was supple with no
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular examination revealed an
irregular rate and rhythm.  A [**3-14**] holosystolic murmur.  The
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.   The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were warm and well perfused with 1+
edema.  Neurologic examination was grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to Cardiothoracic Surgery Service and started on heparin
infusion and was scheduled for redo mitral valve replacement
on [**3-11**].

The patient had an uneventful preoperative course.  On [**3-11**], she was brought to the operating room where she underwent
redo mitral valve replacement.  Please see the Operative Note
for full details.  In summary, she had a redo mitral valve
replacement with a 27-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve.  Her
bypass time was 79 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 60
minutes.  She tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient
had a mean arterial pressure of 72 with a central venous
pressure of 14.  She had a propofol infusion as well as a
nitroglycerin infusion.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Her anesthesia was reversed.  She was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the night of her surgery,
requiring only a nitroglycerin infusion to adequately control
her blood pressure.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable on postoperative
day one.  Her nitroglycerin infusion was weaned to off.  She
was started on oral medications.  Her chest tubes were
removed.

On postoperative day two, the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable.  Her central lines were removed as
were her temporary pacemaker wires, and she was transferred
to the floor for continued postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.

Once of the floor, the patient had an uneventful hospital
course.  With the assistance of the nursing staff and the
Physical Therapy staff, her activity level was gradually
increased.  She was again begun on her Coumadin as well as a
heparin infusion while awaiting an adequate increase in her
INR.

By postoperative day six, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be discharged to home.  At the time of
discharge, the patient's physical examination was as follows.
Vital signs revealed a temperature of 98.4, heart rate was 76
(ventricularly paced), blood pressure was 111/99, respiratory
rate was 20, and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air.

The patient's laboratory data on the day of discharge
revealed a white blood cell count of 11.4, hematocrit was
32.1, and platelets were 290.  Sodium was 137, potassium was
5.2, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen
was 12, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 58.  INR
was 1.8.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
2.  Percocet one to two tablets q.4-6h. as needed.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg once per day.
4.  Glucophage 850 mg three times per day.
5.  Glyburide 5 mg twice per day.
6.  Lasix 40 mg twice per day.
7.  Coumadin 5 mg once per day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient had an appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] in one
week, an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one to two weeks,
and an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks.
2.  Her INR is to be followed by the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic here at
[**Hospital1 69**] with a goal INR of 2.5
to 3.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Her condition at the time of
discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to home
with [**Hospital6 407**] services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post redo mitral valve replacement with a 27-mm
St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Status post permanent pacemaker.
6.  Status post appendectomy.
