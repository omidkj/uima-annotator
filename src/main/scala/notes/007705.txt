CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-3-9**] 3:07 PM
No acute intracranial process.

CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-3-9**] 3:08 PM
No significant interval change in the large hematoma in the left

thigh adductor muscle compartment since the prior CT scan dated
[**2195-3-8**].

 CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-3-9**] 3:08 PM
1. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions with almost
complete
collapse of the left lower lobe and right basilar opacities,
could be due to atelectasis or aspiration, much less likely
pneumonia.
2. 6-mm and less lung nodules, warrant further followup in one
year if the
patient has no risk factor, and in 6 to 12 months if the patient
has risk
factors for malignancy.
3. Aortic valve replacement. Cardiomegaly. Coronary artery and
mitral
annulus calcifications.
4. Mediastinal lymph nodes, likely reactive.
5. Ascending aorta enlargement, up to 4.7 cm, above the
sinotubular junction.  Pulmonary artery enlargement, could be
pulmonary hypertension.
6. Signs of volume overload. Mild upper lobe predominant
centrilobular
emphysema.

 MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-3-14**] 9:22 PM
Limited study. No definite sign of restricted diffusion to
suggest acute spinal cord ischemia.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-3-14**] 9:21 PM
No signs of diffusion-weighted abnormalities

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-3-16**] 12:15 PM
1. Interval increase in size of large hematoma in the left thigh
adductor
muscle compartments since prior CT of [**2195-3-9**], with
internal hematocrit effect. This could represent a liquefying
hematoma or, if the thigh circumference has increased, could be
due to acute bleeding.
2. No retroperitoneal hematoma.
3. Malpositioned NG tube, with side ports at the level of the GE
junction,
advancement recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 69 year old man with mechanical heart valve and a
fib, admitted for anticoagulation before PVI ablation by EP the
day after admission. Initially his INR was 3.1, so heparin drip
was discontinued. Continued on home dose of atenolol and
aspirin. Continue home rosuvastatin 10 mg po daily. Repeat INR
the morning of [**2195-3-6**] was 2.1, so patient was taken to cath lab
for procedure.  After his procedure, he became tremulous and
agitated in the PACU with significant groin bleeding.  This was
attributed to alcohol withdrawl and the patient confirmed his
last drink was 36 hours prior and that he drinks 10 beers per
day. Per patient, he has become tremulous during admissions in
the past.  No history of seizures or hallucination.  Given
difficulty with holding pressure and significant groin bleeding,
patient was intubated in the PACU and sent to the ICU on [**3-6**].
He was then treated with IV diazepam for withdrawl per CIWA
protocol.  On [**3-7**] patient was restarted on Warfarin 10mg but had
a significant Hct drop and was treated with Vitamin K, platelets
and FFP on [**3-8**]. On [**3-8**] extubation was attempted but the patient
failed due to altered mental status so was reintubated.  Sputum
grew GPCs.

# Respiratory status- For his respiratory status, patient was
initially intubated for delirium, inability to control bleeding.
 He was then extubated and reintubated on [**3-8**] with continued
altered mental status in the setting of Valium.  On [**3-8**] he was
also started on Vanc/Levofloxacin for concern for CAP and GPC in
sputum & CXR concerning for left lung process. [**3-11**] Vanco was
discontinued as sputum grew MSSA.  Mini-BAL on [**3-15**] revealed no
microrganisms and no PMNs, which ultimately grew oral flora.
TEE was obtained to look for vegetations, but none were found.
Also on [**3-15**], he spiked a new fever and was pancultured and
antibiotics were broadened to Cipro/Vanc/Zosyn for VAP. Given
his failure to improve for several days following, IP was
contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible trach placement but could not do so given
his C-collar.  Ultimately, his RSBI did improve to < 105 and on
[**3-19**] he was extubated.  His cough was not overly strong
initially and he did require frequent suctioning but was able to
protect his airway.  On [**3-20**] his sputum culture revealed
ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES and
