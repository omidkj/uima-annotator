Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**]
Chief Complaint:
mental status changes, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
64 yoM with history of dCHF, COPD on 2L home O2 (noncompliant),
OSA with phtn, hypertension, recurrent GI bleeds in the setting
of
acquired [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease, and MGUS treated with chemo
velcade and dexamethasone x4 weeks with ongoing treatment
recently hospitalized for dyspnea on exertion and weakness,
discharged [**10-8**] from [**Hospital1 18**].
.
During the last hosptialization his dyspnea was thought to be
multifactorial from diastolic CHF, COPD and pulmonary
hypertension. He was treated with diuresis and nebulizers.  His
symptoms did not completely resolve.  He presented on the day of
admission to oncology clinic for chemotherapy, but prior to
initiation he reported feeling winded with short ambulation,
ambulatory O2 sat was 78%, returning to 94% at rest.  Repeat
ambulatory sats to 85%. He was referred to the ED.  He did not
get scheduled chemo.
.
In the ED, V/S were 97.2 66 99/85 18 100% 4L.  He was noted to
be slightly confused, with sats in the low 90s on 4L.  ABG was
7.23/ 117 /90 /52.  Crackles noted on exam.  He was given
Levofloxacin 500mg po, prednisone 60mg and Duoneb X 1.  Labs
were significant for CO2 of 5, BNP 2166 similar to recent
admission.  CXR could not rule out L basilar infiltrate.  Before
transfer, V/S 128/59, 77, 95% 2L. He was mentating
appropriately.  Repeat ABG 7.33/86/63/47.
.
On the floor:  Pt is satting 95% on 2L, in no respiratory
distress and feels very comfortable.

Brief Hospital Course:
64yo male with acquired [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]'s disease associated with
MGUS, recurrent GI bleeds, diastolic HF, pulmonary HTN, severe
COPD on 2L, and OSA (refuses to use BiPAP), p/w acute on chronic
hypercarbic/hypoxemic resp failure likely [**2-25**] untreated severe
OSA, PH, COPD exacerbation, and chronic CHF. He was initially
admitted to the ICU, but was not intubated.

#Acute on chronic respiratory failuredue to OSA and COPD:
-initially felt to be likely [**2-25**] CHF and COPD exacerbation on
underlying severe untreated OSA/OHS. There was no obvious
pneumonia on CXR and pt remained afebrile w/o leukocytosis. His
mental status/somnolence and hypercarbia improved after BiPAP
set at 18/10 4L O2.  Suggest he use BiPAP overnight and with
naps.
-He will need a retitration sleep study as an outpt to further
optimize and should have close follow-up with his sleep/pulm
doctor [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (we have emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] re this issue).  He
was transferred to the medical floor where he did very well. He
was sufficiently concerned and indicated that he would use BiPAP
at home as instructed.

#CKD - his creatinine did rise from 1.2 on admission to 1.7 with
diuresis in the ICU. Looking back at his previous labs, his
creatinine has fluctuated up in this range in the past (was 1.9
in [**2195-8-24**]), and no other cause for renal failure was
identified. Potentially nephrotoxic meds were held,

#MGUS: f/u on UPEP

#HTN: continue home meds

#Nutrition consult for obesity/dietary input.

64yo male with severe COPD on continuous home O2, OSA (in the
past has refused to use BiPAP), acquired [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]-[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]'s
disease associated with MGUS, recurrent GI bleeding, diastolic
HF, pulmonary HTN, who presented with dyspnea likely from COPD
exacerbation.
.
# Acute on chronic respiratory failure requiring ICU stay but
not intubation
- MICU team felt COPD exacerbation main component and started
high dose steroids, Abx, nebulized bronchodilators
- no evidence of bronchospasm on my exam - am tapering steroids
rapidly
-D/C levofloxacin
- wean O2 to maintain sats 88-92%, down to home flow of 2L/min
via NC. Check ambulatory sats
- OSA likely large component - needs to wear BiPAP at night. He
did last evening and sats dropped to 93% only (good)
.
# Acute kidney injury
-admission creat = 1.0, has been gradually increasing - now 1.8.

-FeNa yesterday = 0.95%, suggesting pre-renal azotemia but
creatinine continues to increase despite IV hydration and
holding ACE-I
-no evidence of urinary retention (PVR < 350)
-He was seen in consultation by Nephrology on [**2195-10-12**], and they
agreed with trial of IV hydration and with holding the
ace-inhibitor and the diuretic. His discharge serum creatinine
was 1.7.

# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
-last echo in [**2195-6-24**] showed right heart failure (likely due
to chronic lung disease and resulting pulmonary hypertension)
but preserved LV function
-no evidence of acute HF now - received torsemide inthe ICU with
resulting decrease in BNP, but increase in creatinine - on the
floor, w
