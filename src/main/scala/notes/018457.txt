Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Cardiac catheterization with placement of drug-eluting stent
[**2106-4-8**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89277**] is an 84yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2098**]
(LIMA-LAD and SVG-Ramus), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CRI,
unilateral vocal cord paralysis after CABG in [**2098**], and
sarcoidosis who presents now with exertional dyspnea and chest
pain concerning for unstable angina.

Mr. [**Known lastname 89277**] did well s/p CABG in [**2098**], though had recurrent chest
pain four years later. Exercise thallium test [**2103-6-21**] showed
mild anteroapical ischemia, but given patient did not want to
procede with repeat cath, he was continued on medical management
of CAD. However, over the past several months he has had
increasing exertional dyspnea, prompting repeat exercise
thallium stess test on [**2105-12-4**]. This study showed no ischemia,
but did show evidence of a borderline increase in LV filling
pressure during exercise. Had echo [**2106-3-26**], which showed mild
concentric LVH, decreased LV diastolic compliance, and
borderline pulmonary hypertension. LVEF was preserved.

Patient had been started on furosemide 20mg daily by his
cardiologist in late [**Month (only) 958**], given concern that exertional
dyspnea may be secondary to dCHF. Patient's symptoms did not
improve, and he also began to develop exertional chest pain. He
describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation across his chest
which is non-radiating and comes on after walking a short
distance. The pressure is associated with mild dyspnea, but no
dizziness, nausea, or diaphoresis. The pain resolves within one
minute if he stops to rest. Over the past 2-3 days, he has also
had similar chest pressure with minimal activity such as washing
dishes. He saw his cardiologist for follow-up in clinic
yesterday, who was concerned that his symptoms are due to
recurrent ischemia. Cardiologist recommended right and left
heart cath for further evaluation, and patient is admitted now
for pre-cath hydration given CRI, with plans for cath early
tomorrow morning.

On arrival to the floor, patient is comfortable and denies any
dyspnea or chest pain. Denies any HA, dizziness/lightheadedness.


On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Does report chronic
non-productive cough, chronic right-sided leg cramps at night.
All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of PND,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Patient does report [**2-26**] pound weight gain over past several
months.

IMAGING:
ECG [**2106-4-6**]: Normal sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality.
Otherwise, tracing is within normal limits. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

CXR [**2106-4-6**]:
1. Scattered interstitial and alveolar opacities. Differential
diagnosis
includes pulmonary sarcoidois, however, basilar changes suggest
an additional interstial lung disease or superimposed pulmonary
edema.
2. Pleural irregularity, possible asbestos exposure.

TTE [**2106-4-7**]: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CTA Chest [**2106-4-7**]:
1. No aortic dissection.
2. Extensive moderately severe atherosclerosis of the aorta and
its branches, including thoracic aortic arch ulcers as
described, and ulcerated mixed plaque in the proximal left
subclavian artery, of undetermined age. There is no periaortic
bleeding.
3. Occlusion of the left vertebral artery from its origin, of
undetermined
age.
4. Extensive scarring in both apices and lung bases consistent
with the given history of sarcoidosis, comparison with prior
imaging is suggested to determine disease activity.
5. Very mild pulmonary edema.
6. Solid left renal lesion, possible renal cell carcinoma.
7. Chronic mild scarring and traction bronchiectasis, right
lower lobe.
