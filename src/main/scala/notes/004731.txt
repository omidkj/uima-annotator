Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
endocarditis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
38 yo man with a h/o IVDA, TV endocarditis in [**2117**] s/p
bioprosthetic valve replacement and recurrent endocarditis in
[**2118**] (MRSA). He was in his usual state of health until 7 days
ago when he began having fevers, chills, B foot pain, nausea and
diarrhea. He presented to [**Hospital1 1562**] 4 days ago ([**4-8**]) and was
found to have high-grade MSSA bacteremia. He was treated with IV
Nafcillin and had an echo showing possible TV and MV
endocarditis (although suboptimal study). CXR showed RML
pneumonia. Possible RML pneumonia/septic emboli. He was felt to
be clinically worsening with continued high-spiking fevers,
bacteremia, worsening thrombocytopenia. His antibiotics were
broadened to cefipime and flagyl prior to transfer. Of note he
also was caught using cocaine and marijuania at [**Hospital1 1562**].

In the MICU pt was changed to IV nafcillin and gentamicin for
synergy is now afebrile with VSS and comfortable without any
complaints when seen.  He had a TTE demonstrating multiple
moderate-sized vegetations on the tricuspid valve leaflets,
causing obstruction of transtricuspid flow, and moderate
tricuspid stenosis. CT [**Doctor First Name **] were consulted and determined him a
poor surgical candidate given risk of repeat-sternotomy and his
current drug abuse

Past Medical History:

TV at [**Hospital1 2025**]

HCV
IVDA and polysubstance abuse

Physical Exam:
(on admission)
T 100.8 BP 113/79 HR 96 RR 30-36 96% on RA
General: sleepy, tachypneic, no distress
HEENT: NCAT, PERRL, EOMI, neck supple, w/o LAD, icteric sclera,
no hemorrhage
CV: tachy + systolic murmur at LLSB. ?S4
Pulm: scattered crackles and wheezing
Abd: s/nd + RUQ and LUQ TTP. + liver edge, spleen non-palpable.
no rebound/gaurding
Ext: papular rash on RLE. no petechiae/splinter hemorrhage or
[**Last Name (un) **] lesions/osler nodes


Pertinent Results:
TTE ([**2120-4-12**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) There is no ventricular
septal defect. The aortic arch is moderately dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. A bioprosthetic tricuspid
valve is present. The gradients are higher than expected for
this type of prosthesis. The leaflets of the tricuspid
prosthesis are thickened. There is are multiple moderate-sized
vegetations on the tricuspid valve leaflets, causing obstruction
of transtricuspid flow. There is moderate tricuspid stenosis
(area 1.0-1.5cm2). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: bioprosthesis tricuspid valve endocarditis;
tricuspid valve prosthesis stenosis
.
CT head ([**2120-4-11**]): No CT evidence for septic emboli in the brain.
.
CT chest, abd, pelvis ([**2120-4-11**]): 1. Severe multifocal airspace
opacities are identified within the lung parenchyma. This may
represent multifocal infection possibly from septic emboli. 2.
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. 3.
Fusion of the right SI joint for which clinical correlation is
recommended as detailed above. Gallbladder wall is mildly
thickened and there is splenomegaly, free fluid, as well as
enlarged perihepatic lymph nodes, which may all represent a
sequela from underlying chronic liver disease.
.
TTE ([**2120-4-26**]): The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%) The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. Mitral valve leaflets are normal, with
trivial mitral regurgitation. A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is
present. There is a large (2.0 x 1.1 cm), highly-mobile
vegetation on the tricuspid prosthesis. There is no abscess of
the tricuspid valve, and the sewing ring appears intact, without
dehiscence or paravalvular regurgitation. The vegetation is
partially obstructive to flow, resulting in
functionally-moderate tricuspid stenosis (mean gradient 15
mmHg). No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
Estimated pulmonary pressures are normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Prosthetic tricuspid valve endocarditis with
moderate functional tricuspid stenosis.
.
CT chest w/ contrast ([**2120-4-25**]): 1. Persistent multiple pulmonary
septic emboli. 2. Hepatosplenomegaly. Decreased attenuation of
the right lobe may represent focal fatty infiltration. 3. Fusion
of the right SI joint, unchanged. 4. Increased sclerosis of the
left pubic symphysis, unchanged. 5. Scattered mesenteric,
retroperitoneal, and periportal lymph nodes, unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
38 yo man with h/o TV endocarditis with prosthetic valve
transferred from OSH on [**4-11**] w/ high-grade MSSA bacteremia,
tricuspid prosthetic valve endocarditis, and septic pumonary
emboli recovering on nafcillin, rifampin (s/p 2 wks of gent),
now with budding yeast in [**Month/Day (4) **] cx from [**4-23**] and new murmur over
apex radiating into axilla.
.

# MSSA endocarditis

In the MICU pt was changed to IV nafcillin and gentamicin for
synergy and was afebrile with VSS and comfortable without any
complaints when seen. He had a TTE demonstrating multiple
moderate-sized vegetations on the tricuspid valve leaflets,
causing obstruction of transtricuspid flow, and moderate
tricuspid stenosis. CT [**Doctor First Name **] were consulted and determined him a
poor surgical candidate given risk of repeat-sternotomy and his
current drug abuse.
.

Enlarged TV vegetation on top of tricuspid prosthetic valve MSSA
bacteremia and endocarditis. CT torso without obvious signs of
seeding, TTE with enlarged TV vegetation after fungemia, dilated
fundoscopic exam by ophtho normal. Continued 6 week course of
nafcillin+rifampin, from first neg bld cx ([**4-11**])m this was
completed [**5-23**]. He was kept an inpatient to complete course due
to history of IV drug use and inability to discharge to facility
with PICC. He has a ESR and CRP drawn prior to discharge so that
ID could repeat these labs at his follow up appointment to
ensure resolution of his bacteremia.
.

# Candidemia

Completed 2 week course of fluconazole, d/c on [**5-8**], repeat
[**Month/Year (2) **] cx 5 days later with no growth to date.
.

# Drug abuse

- used cocaine and MJ at OSH, caught taking pain meds and mixing
in needles at [**Hospital1 18**]
- no pain meds
- Social work and addiction medicine following
- appears to sincerely intend to not use in future (but
definitely at high risk)
- states he will enter rehabilitation program once he leaves
hospital
- patient to follow up with psychiatry, was started on anti
depressant inpatient
.

# Disposition

Patient was scheduled follow up appointment with ID on [**2120-6-12**]
for follow up and with a new PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] on [**2120-6-17**]. He was
instructed of the importance to follow up at these appointments
