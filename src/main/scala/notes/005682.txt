History of Present Illness:
84 y/o female with known TAA followed
conservatively now admitted to OSH for chest and epigastric
pain.
Pain [**3-26**], worse with deep breathing.  Worsened on 3 days ago
when she presented from her [**Hospital3 **] to [**Location (un) **].  Cardiac
work up revealed unchanged EKG and negative cardiac biomarkers.
A CTA performed showed a 5.5cm ascending and a 5cm(?up to 5.4cm)
descending thoracic aortic aneurysm, increased in size from [**6-23**]
when the corresponding measurements were 5.1cm and 4.5cm.  Blood
pressure control was initiated and she ultimately was started on
a nitro gtt to keep her BP<120.  She currently is still
experiencing the pain which she describes to me as largely
epigastric, associated with bloating, and somewhat reproducible
on palpation.  She also states the pain radiates up her chest to
a mid sternal location.  No c/o back pain.  She states that
similar discomfort has been present for the past 6months
although
the current pain is more severe.
