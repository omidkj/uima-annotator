Radiology:

[**10-4**] carotid US: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40%
carotid stenosis.

[**10-4**] chest, abd, pelvis CTA:
1. No aortic dissection or aneurysm. No evidence of pulmonary
embolism.
2. Extensive atherosclerosis in the aorta, coronary arteries,
and multiple aortic branches as described.
3. Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
effusions.
4. Emphysema.
5. Incompletely characterized dense 4-cm lesion in the left
kidney, which may represent a solid mass such as a renal cell
carcinoma or a hyperdense cyst. Further characterization by MRI
is recommended.
6. Multiple hypodensities in the liver and both kidneys, some of
which represent cysts, and others are too small to characterize
but probably also represent cysts.
7. Enlarged prostate.
8. Grade I anterolisthesis at L4/5.

[**10-4**] head CT perfusion: CONCLUSION: Old right middle cerebral
artery distribution infarction.
No evidence of acute infarction on the noncontrast study.
The CT perfusion was centered below the middle cerebral artery
territory. The small portion of the inferior left temporal lobe
suggests reduced blood volume and blood flow, with no evidence
of elevation of the mean transit time. Given the small portion
of MCA territory included, this is a nondiagnostic result.
CT angiography demonstrates patency of the internal carotid and
vertebral arteries and their major intracranial branches. There
is a fenestrated proximal basilar artery.

[**10-4**] PCXR: Moderate cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular
congestion, and mild pulmonary edema are new. Patient has had
cardiomegaly in the more distant past, on [**2136-5-2**].
ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. No
pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

[**10-4**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia, rate 113. Since the previous
tracing of [**2137-7-25**] the heart rate is faster. The Q-T interval is
slightly more prolonged. Q waves are not seen at this time in
the inferior leads. There is increased voltage present across
the entire precordium.

[**10-5**] head MRI/MRA:
Diffusion images demonstrate an acute infarct in the left
posterior frontal lobe involving the motor cortex. A small
rounded area of high signal on FLAIR and diffusion images
posteriorly within the sulcus could be due to a thrombus within
a peripheral artery or due to a small infarct in the parietal
cortex. Chronic infarct and encephalomalacia are seen in the
right frontal region from previous MCA infarct. There is no mass
effect or hydrocephalus. Increased signal in the right side of
the brain stem indicate Wallerian degeneration from previous
infarct. There is moderate brain atrophy seen. There are mild
changes of small vessel disease are identified. Soft tissue
changes with inspissated secretions are seen in the right
maxillary sinus with soft tissue changes in bilateral anterior
ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Acute left posterior frontal infarct. Chronic right
MCA infarct. Other changes as described above.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries
of anterior and posterior circulation. No evidence of major
vascular occlusion seen in the arteries of anterior and
posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of occlusion or high-grade stenosis.

[**10-8**] 2D ECHO: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated.  2. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed.  3. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis.  4. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.  5. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen.  6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+)  mitral regurgitation is seen.  7.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2137-10-3**], LV function has decreased, and mitral
regurgitation is worse.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo man w/ PMH sig for prior strokes, HTN, DM who p/w acute
onset language deficits. Neurological exam significant for
aphemia. His story was most consistent with a lesion in the
inferior left frontal gyrus or to association cortex from
Broca's area to motor strip resulting in mutism. Suspected
embolic source from either heart or carotids. Given that no
obvious vessel occlusion was seen on CTA of the head and the
patient was past the three hour window, the decision was made
not to pursue thrombolysis. He was intubated for airway
protection and was admitted to the Neurology ICU for further
management. He had a chest CT as well given some history
obtained of chest pain; this showed no dissection but did show
mild pulmonary edema.  He was subsequently called out to the
floor to the neurology service.

1. Neuro:  MRI showed a new stroke.  His exam improved over the
hospital course.  PT and OT evaluated the patient.

2. Pulm:  Patient was extubated on [**8-5**] to nasal cannula.

3. DM:  Patient was treated with SSI.

4. CV: Antihypertensives were initially held in the acute stroke
setting.

5. Psychosocial: Family was informed of his diagnosis and some
discussion, they decided to make him DNR/DNI.  Patient
subsequently expressed to the primary team multiple times by
written instructions that he did not wish to have a PEG placed.
This wish was corroborated by his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Known firstname 1312**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1313**], who has also been a long time freind and his
son.  Palliative care consult was requested and patient was
subsequently made comfort measures only.  He was discharged to
Hospice care.
