Imaging:
EKG [**5-27**]:
Sinus bradycardia. Poor R wave progression. Cannot rule out
prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2184-5-14**] there is no significant diagnostic change.

.
CXR 4.17:
FINDINGS: Heart size unchanged. Right upper lobe opacification
and right
mediatinal fullness corresponds to thick walled upper lobe
cavity and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy with differential including
Wegener's, SCC/cancer, and fungal infection. No new focus of
consolidation is seen. There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged highly abnormal chest radiograph.
.
MRI Head [**5-29**]:
IMPRESSION: Multiple enhancing lesions are identified in the
brain as
described above. Although metastatic disease is a consideration,
given the
restricted diffusion on the diffusion-weighted images, infection
needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis. The
appearances could also be
secondary to multiple tuberculomas given a cavitary lesion in
the lung.
.
CT Torso [**5-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with extensive metastatic disease,
including pulmonary nodules, bilateral adrenal masses, and
bilateral renal masses. Lymphadenopathy in mediastinal, right
greater than left hilar, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric
locations, consistent with nodal spread of neoplastic disease.
Bronchoscopic biopsy is recommended.
2. Cavitary pulmonary nodule in the posterior segment of the
right upper
lobe, suspicious for primary lung carcinoma. Please see the
differential
discussion in the prior chest CTA report for less likely
considerations.
3. Right upper lobe pulmonary interstitial thickening,
suspicious for
lymphangetic spread.
4. Subtle sclerosis in the T4 vertebral body. While
indeterminate, osseous
metastasis is not excluded. If there will be a change in
clinical management, then a bone scan may be helpful.
5. Wedge-shaped peripheral opacity in the right middle lobe,
evolving since
the prior chest CTA. Second evolving process in the right upper.
While these may be secondary to infection, the morphology of the
right middle lobe opacity raises the possibility of a pulmonary
infarct.
6. Aberrant right subclavian artery.
.
Head CT [**5-30**](post-bx):
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes from recent resection of the
left frontal
lesion with minimal high attenuation in the resection bed and
moderate
perilesional vasogenic edema causing effacement of the left
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the left lateral ventricle without shift of midline structures.
.
ECHO [**2184-6-1**]
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valveular pathology or pathologic flow
identified. Normal biventricular cavity sizes and regiona/global
systolic function.
.
[**2184-6-4**] CT head
IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral areas of vasogenic edema, from
known brain
metastasis. Compared to [**2184-5-30**], the overall appearance
is not
significantly changed.

***************


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after complaints of nausea,
vomiting, and not "feeling herself".  Of significance, she is
status post diagnosis of lung mass for which she was being
worked up on an outpatient basis.
.
1. NSCLC, metastatic to brain/nausea/vomiting/headache -- Upon
admission a head CT was performed which identified multiple
infra and supra tentorial brain lesions, including the brain
stem.  High dose steroid therapy was initiated to treat
associated vasogenic edema.  A left stereotactic brain biopsy
was performed on [**5-30**].  Post-operatively
