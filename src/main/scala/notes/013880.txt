treated for pancreatitis, which she has had before, with
resolution.  However, her course was complicated by a cough and
shortness of breath.  A bronchoscopy revealved diffuse [**Female First Name (un) **]
pneumonia and enterobacter pneumonia.  Fluconazole was started.

intubated on [**6-2**].  She was also put on a dopamine drip.  On [**6-4**],
she was extubated and weaned off dopamine, but on [**6-5**] she
developed worsening metabolic acidosis and was re-intubated
electively for fatigue.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for
further care.

IMAGING
CXR: [**2165-6-5**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Abnormal position of the ET tube terminating in right main
bronchus.
2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
3.  Left lower lobe consolidation could be due to infectious
process or
atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 79 year old female with PMHx of protein c/s defiency
and recurrent DVTs/PEs on anticoagulation s/p IVC filter, and
parkinson's disease, who presented to an OSH on [**5-14**] with a
partial small bowel obstruction and pancreatitis.  Her hospital
course was complicated by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and enterobacter pneumonia
and was intubated twice before transferring to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for fatigue and increasing
acidosis.  Her acidosis improved and she was extubated without
complications.
.
# PNEUMONIA:
She had a CXR upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] which showed a LLL
consolidation and left pleural effusion with some pulmonary
edema.  We continued to treat her enterobacter and [**Female First Name (un) **]
pneumonia with fluconazole and levofloxacin and she improved
over the hospital course, and did not require oxygen on
discharge.  She will complete a 14 day course of fluconazole and
levofloxacin after discharge.  She was diuresed adequately with
furosemide.  Albuterol nebs were given to her but she became
tremulous and it was stopped.  There is a question of why she
would be infected with [**Female First Name (un) **] pneumonia and an
immunocomprimised state is a possibility.  Her HIV test is
negative.  Her SPEP and UPEP are pending at time of discharge.
Please follow up for results.
.
# CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:
Per her outpatient clinic (PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32496**],
1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 58523**]):
Creatinine 2.0 in [**1-7**], and 2.5 in [**8-6**].  She is
currently at her baseline.  (Cr=1.8 today.)  She had a renal u/s
that was neg for hydronephrosis.
.
# NON-ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:
Per outpatient clinic, she has chronic metabolic acidosis.  Her
bicard in [**2165-1-2**] was 20.  She is currently at 21. Liekly due
to chronic renal insufficiency.
.
# NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA
Non-hemolytic, guaiac negative. Likely anemia of chronic
disease. Consider outpatient workup including colonoscopy.
.
# H/O DVT/PE:
She has protein C/S deficiency and is s/p IVC filter.  She takes
coumadin and Fragmin at home with an INR goal of [**1-4**]. She had a
negative LENIs at OSH.  She will continue coumadin 2.5 mg qDay
and prophylactic enoxaparin (30mg QD)on discharge.
.
# ORAL THRUSH:
Resolved at discharge with fluconazole.
.
# PANCREATITIS: resolved upon tranfer from OSH. Unclear
etiology. Will need further workup as an outpatient. [**Month (only) 116**]
consider MRCP.
.
# PARKINSONS DISEASE:
Continued outpatient Ropinirole HCl and Carbidopa-Levodopa.
.
# CHRONIC PAIN:
She has seen pain management in the past.  She is currently on a
fentanyl patch, a lidocaine patch on her wrist. Percocet was
given for breakthrough pain.
