HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old
Spanish-speaking man who has been hospitalized for the better
part of the past two months in two separate admissions.
Prior to his first hospitalization on [**2119-9-13**], the
patient had been scheduled for an aortic valve replacement.
He was admitted to [**Hospital6 256**] on
[**2119-9-13**] with a chief complaint of lethargy and
headaches.  At that time he had an extensive medical workup
and was found to have gastrointestinal bleed as well as right
lower lobe lesion.  Following treatment for his medical
problems the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement
with #21 pericardial tissue valve and coronary artery bypass
graft times one with vein graft to the posterior descending
artery on [**10-2**].  Following this surgery, the patient had
a permanent pacer placed on [**10-6**].  The patient was
discharged to home on [**10-10**].  He was then readmitted to
[**Hospital6 256**] on [**10-12**] with a
chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath.  He
was found to be in congestive heart failure and was admitted
to the Medical Service at that time.

quit times 35 years, however, when he did smoke he smoked two
packs per day times 20 years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's physical examination at
the time of admission revealed vital signs temperature 98.5,
heartrate 125, irregular, respiratory rate 26, blood pressure
127/77, oxygen saturations 97% on 3 liters of nasal prong.
General:  Mild distress from shortness of breath.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat, mucous membranes moist,
oropharynx clear.  7 to 8 cm jugulovenous distension on the
right.  Lungs, decreased breathsounds throughout.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, II to III/VI
systolic ejection murmur at right upper sternal border.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities, 1 to 2+ edema bilaterally.
Pulses 2+ bilaterally.  Neurological, alert and oriented
times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs at the time of admission revealed
white blood count 11.3, hematocrit 31.1, platelets 415.  PT
is 16.3, PTT 29.6, INR 1.8, sodium 132, potassium 5.6,
chloride 93, carbon dioxide 33, BUN 24, creatinine 0.7,
glucose 277.  ALT 51, AST 28, LDH 327, alkaline phosphatase
449, total bilirubin 0.4 and albumin 3.0.  Chest x-ray
compared to [**10-7**], cardiac and mediastinum are
unchanged.  Persistent left small and right moderate pleural
effusions, bibasilar atelectasis.  Electrocardiogram paced at
60 beats/minute, unchanged from previous pacer
electrocardiogram.  Chest computerized tomography scan is
negative for pulmonary embolism.  Moderate amount of fluid
around the heart, consolidation at bases bilaterally.
Effusions on the left greater than the right, left upper lobe
mass, stable in size.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously the patient was
admitted to the medical service.  He was ruled out for an
myocardial infarction and he was diuresed with intravenous
Lasix, started on an increasing beta blocker dose and on an
ACE inhibitor as well.  On hospital day #4 the patient was
noted to have an elevated white blood cell count to 19,000.
On hospital day #6 he was noted to have sternal drainage
which was new during the course of this hospitalization.
Also on hospital day #6 the patient was seen by the Plastic
Surgery Service.  He was brought to the Operating Room where
he underwent sternal wound exploration and superficial
debridement as well as rewiring of his sternum.  J-vac
dressing was placed at that time with the anticipation that
the patient would have a flap closure in the near future.
Blood cultures drawn at the time of the initial increase in
the white blood cell count were positive for gram positive
cocci and urinalysis at that time revealed Pseudomonas and
Gram negative rods.  The patient was started on Cipro for his
urinary tract infection and Vancomycin and gentamicin for his
sternal wound infection.  Further identification showed that
he had Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his
superficial sternum.  The patient did well in the immediate
postoperative period.

His back dressing remained in place.  He remained
hemodynamically stable, however, on postoperative day #3 from
his sternal debridement he began to complain of abdominal
distention and pain.  Gastrointestinal consult was placed and
he had an abdominal computerized axial tomography scan which
was negative except that it showed a large amount of stool
throughout his colon.  On postoperative day #5 the patient
had a PICC line placed for continuing requirements of
intravenous antibiotics.  Over the next two weeks the patient
remained hospitalized receiving his intravenous antibiotics.
He remained hemodynamically stable, however, he continued to
complain of abdominal distention, occasionally associated
with nausea and vomiting.  His KUB continued to show large
amounts of stool throughout the gastrointestinal tract.  He
was initially treated conservatively by being kept NPO and
his diet slowly advanced to clear liquids, full liquids and
soft solids and then treated more aggressively with stool
softeners, suppositories and enemas.  Gastrointestinal
complaints persisted, however, to a lesser degree and on
[**11-2**], the patient was returned to the Operating Room
with Plastic Surgery Service at which time he underwent
sternal wound closure with bilateral pectoral flaps.  Please
see the operation report for full details.

The patient again did well in the immediate postoperative
period, however, he continued to complain of abdominal pain,
bloating and cramping.  He was maintained on a regime of
Pericolace, Metamucil and an occasional enema.  Wound
cultures from his flap closure showed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans and a
urine culture also was positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans at that
time, [**11-6**].  He was started on Fluconazole.  Over the
next week the patient did well.  From a wound standpoint his
flap closure appeared to be healing well.  From an infectious
disease standpoint he was afebrile with a normal white blood
cell count.  Hemodynamically he remained stable.  From a
respiratory standpoint he remained slightly short of breath
with activity.  From a gastrointestinal standpoint he
continued to complain of abdominal pain, however, no nausea
or vomiting were noted and he continued to have regular bowel
movements.  On [**11-8**], the patient continued to
progress.  With the assistance of case management plans were
tentatively begun for discharge to home with [**First Name (Titles) 1587**] [**Last Name (Titles) 21150**] for his intravenous antibiotic care.
Monday, the week of [**11-13**], the patient was noted to
have mental status changes.  Initially he was described as
being sleepy and somewhat disoriented.  Later on in the
morning he was found by the nursing staff to be unresponsive
and twitching.  Vital signs at that time were stable.  A
blood gas done at that time showed his PH to be 7.28 with a
pO2 of 59 and pCO2 of 70.  His electrolytes at that time
