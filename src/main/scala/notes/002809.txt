EKG [**2133-11-30**]: Sinus rhythm. There are Q waves in the inferior
leads consistent with prior myocardial infarction. There is an
early transition consistent with posterior involvement. ST-T
wave changes consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy,
although ischemia or myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.
Compared to the previous tracing inferior Q waves are more
prominent and early transition is new.

KUB [**2133-12-1**]: Three views of the abdomen and pelvis including two
obtained in the left lateral decubitus position demonstrate
nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. No free air is seen. A
peritoneal dialysis catheter is in place. Indistinctness of the
abdominal structures is consistent with ascites. A total right
hip prosthesis is in place. There are degenerative changes of
the left hip and lumbar spine. Vascular calcifications are
noted. IMPRESSION: No obstruction, ileus, or free air
identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Peritonitis.
Ms. [**Known lastname 97063**] was admitted to the renal service, where she
underwent repeat fluid check through her IP line that showed WBC
count > 28K. She was started on ceftazidine IP (dwell x 6 hours)
and given 2 g of vancomycin IP (also dwell x 6H). she also
received 200 mg fluconazole. The morning following admission,
she became febrile to 101.2. A 3rd peritoneal fluid sample
showed marked decreased in WBC count to 1900. She was continued
on her same antibiotics (no vanco on hospital day 2 given level
of > 50). She showed occasional signs of confusion throughout
the day (difficulty reciting months of the year backward, slow
response time), and had continued abdominal pain worse with
palpation but was otherwise in NAD. Overnight that evening, she
developed a new oxygen requirement and chest pain with possible
EKG changes. CXR showed a questionable new opacity, generating
concern for possible aspiration. She became hypotensive to
70s/40s and felt lightheaded. She was transferred to the MICU at
that time. She was given IV fluids and her blood pressure was
restored. With concern for pneuomonia, given a possible new
right middle lobe opacity, she was started on IV ceftazadine and
IV flagyl. She became hemodynamically stable and was transferred
to the general medical floor. IV flagyl was transitioned to PO
form. She continued on an eight day course of IV ceftaz, flagyl,
and renally dosed IP vancomycin. Cefttaz and flagyl were
discontinued at this time as well as fluconazole. IP vancomycin
and IP ceftaz were discontinued after a 14 day course was
completed. Throughout this course, blood and peritoneal cultures
did not grow anything. It was felt she had a significant
infection, but unfortunately, no organism was identified.
Approximately, four days after completion of antibiotics,
patient developed a wbc with left shift to 14,000. Patient
remained afebrile and was clinically without a focus of
infection. With concern for indolent infection, chest x-ray,
blood and peritoneal cultures were sent. Chest x-ray
demonatrated a retrocardiac opacity. A non-contrast
Chest/Abdominal CT was performed. She received on dose of
vancomycin and cefepime empirically. An opacity was again
demonstrated in the right lower lobe. Since patient was not
showing any signs of pneumonia and white count normalized the
following day, she was not continued on antibiotics.

A calcified fluid collection was demonstrated on CT
posterolateral to her right hip prosthesis. With concern for
abscess, this collection was drained. Ortho was consulted and
felt no further intervention was needed. All cultures remained
negative. Patient did not show any further signs of infection
and it was felt that she did not need any antibiotic treatment.
She will followup with orthopedics. ID recommended repeat
imaging in [**12-24**] week
