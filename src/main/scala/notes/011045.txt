ERCP

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 74652**] is a 40 y/o M with no significant PMH who
presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital in NH on [**2169-10-29**] with chief
complaint of malaise, headache, and fever/chills. He was
initially admitted to the ICU  with persistent fevers to 105; he
had vague RUQ pain on admission and evidence of cholecystitis on
abdominal ultrasound. Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated
with doxycycline, vancomycin, and zosyn. He also received a
one-time dose of tobramycin on admission. Numerous serologies
and cultures have remained negative.
.
Due to findings on abdominal ultrasound and abdominal CT scan,
the patient was evaluated by the surgical team who felt that his
presentation could be consistent with acute cholecystitis. On
[**2169-10-30**] the patient underwent uncomplicated laparascopic
cholecystectomy; intraoperative cholangiogram demonstrated
filling defects which cleared with flushing of the duct
concerning for common bile duct stones.
.
He seemed to improve and was discharged from the ICU on [**10-31**] to
the general medical floor. On [**11-1**] in the morning, the patient
was noted to be hyoxic to 80s while ambulating on 2 L NC. CXR
demonstrated "mild pulmonary edema" per report. At that time,
the patient was receiving IVF at 150 cc/hour. Vancomycin and
doxycycline were discontinued on [**11-1**]. His bilirubin trended up
and he was taken to ERCP which demonstrated two nonobstructive
common bile duct stones. Sphincterotomy was not accomplished due
to the difficult nature of the procedure. He was increasingly
hypoxic throughout the procedure and was eventually intubated.
Upon arrival back to the ICU, the patient's CXR demonstrated
worsening bilateral infiltrates. Oxygenation was difficult and
the patient initially required FiO2 100% with PEEP of 10 (on AC
Tv 400, rate 18) and oxygen saturations in the low-mid 90s. CVP
at that time was 19; he received lasix 40 mg IV X 2 with 1600 cc
UOP and some improvement in oxygen saturations. Despite these
respiratory difficulties, the patient was not hypotensive.
.
However, rior to arrival, the patient was on propofol for
sedation at which point vitals indicate blood pressures down to
89 systolic with HR in the 90s. CVP trended from 19 (initial ICU
presentation at 8:00 pm) to 13 at 0200.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is intubated and sedated;
per report, he received 500 mcg of fentanyl plus vecuronium en
route via the [**Location (un) 7622**] team. Initial blood pressure 106/72 with
pulse in the 90s. Oxygen saturations on AC FiO2 60 with PEEP 10
in the high 90s.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are  normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the
interventricular septum and apex. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right
ventricle. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
.
Impression: biventricular contractile dysfunction involving the
interventricular septum, apex, and apical segment of the right
ventricular free wall; small pericardial effusion without
evidence of cardiac tamponade;  pulmon
