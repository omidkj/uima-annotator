History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 y.o M transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] with
c/o mid back pain since last night, seen at his PCP this morning
for routine visit, he happened to mention about the back pain.

Findings

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.
Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. Normal IVC
diameter (<2.1cm) with <35% decrease during respiration
(estimated RA pressure indeterminate).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Low normal LVEF. No
resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function. Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac
surgery.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild
AS (AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. Mild to moderate
([**12-4**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate [[**12-4**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions

The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is probably normal but the inferolateral wall is not
adequately visualized and there may be hypokinesis in this
territory. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is at least mild aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2) which may be underestimated.
There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: At least mild aortic stenosis (velocity across valve
may be underestimated). Low normal left ventricular systolic
function. Mildly dilated right ventricle with normal function.
Mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

Radiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2183-10-13**]
1:14 PM

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
Reason: b/l sweeling in legs s/p EVAR. Please evaluate for DVT


FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral
common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins
are performed. There is normal flow, compression and
augmentation seen in all of the vessels.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

FINDINGS: Two views. Comparison with [**2183-10-10**]. Bilateral
subsegmental
atelectasis and/or scarring increased density in the right lung
base are
unchanged. Bilateral pleural thickening and/or fluid is stable.
The patient is status post median sternotomy as before.
Mediastinal structures are stable in appearance. A right
subclavian central venous catheter remains in place.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change. There is no definite
evidence of volume overload.

Radiology Report CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2183-10-10**]
9:01 PM

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a moderate right pleural
effusion with associated consolidation, likely atelectasis. A
small focus of consolidation is present within the left lower
lobe which may represe
