Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
neutropenic fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
69 yo gentleman with recurrent AML, extensive hx of desquamating
abx allergies presented to his oncologists office this morning
with neutropenic fever (ANC 0, T102).
.
He reports some pain on the right side of his throat with
swallowing and a tender submandibular nodule on the left side,
but of which have been present for several days to a week.  No
SOB. No cough. No subjective fevers or rigors/chills. No
diahrrea/abdominal pain. No dysuria/pyruria.  No exertional
dyspnea or CP. No rashes beyond his his chronic skin changes.
There have been no sick contacts.
.
He started having a nosebleed this morning and was transfused
with one pack of plts in the [**Hospital 3242**] clinic with a minimal response
from 6 to 8 and no resolution of his bleed.  He was directly
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given his extensive hx of abx allergies and
his need for abx in the setting of neutropenic fever.

IMAGING:
[**5-24**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Resolving right lower lobe pneumonia. No
evidence of new infection.

[**5-25**] Sinus CT: IMPRESSION:
Left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening without bony erosion or
destruction.

[**5-26**] Neck CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Asymmetrically enlarged right submandibular gland, but no
evidence of
abscess within the limits of non-contrast study. Normal parotid
glands.
2. Increased number of small-to-borderline enlarged lymph nodes
bilaterally,
non-specific, but could be secondary to the AML or reactive to
an infection.
3. Significant centrilobular emphysematous changes in the
visualized lung
apices.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Although I agree with the
observation of
asymmetry of the submandibular glands, I believe it is the left
side that is abnormal. On the left, the gland is either
atrophic, or absent. There are several nodes, none exceeding
size criteria, adjacent to the left
submandibular gland. In addition, there is mild obscuration of
fat planes on the left. This might reflect prior resection of
the SMG with post operative changes. If there has not been
resection of the gland, this may reflect prior infection and a
resultant atropy of the SMG. The induration of the fat planes
may be a consequence of past or current infection.

[**5-30**] CT Chest/Ab/Pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Focal consolidation involving the lateral basal segment of
right lower
lobe is again seen and appears improved as compared to the last
scan.
2. Enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes. The right axillary
lymph nodes
are larger in size as compared to the prior scan.
3. Diffuse circumferential thickening involving the terminal
ileum and cecum with no signs of bowel obstruction. In view of
the history of fever and neutropenia, this may suggest an
infectious or inflammatory/Crohn's etiology.
4. Mild free fluid in the pelvis.
5. Sigmoid diverticulosis.

[**5-30**]: IMPRESSION:
1. The right submandibular gland is absent. Per conversation
with the
patient's clinician there is no history of surgical removal of
this gland and therefore the absence may be congenital.
2. There is a group of three abnormally spherical lymph nodes in
the left IB location (in the expected location of that
submandibular gland). Borderline prominant left level V lymph
nodes are also present. These are non-specific and may be
related to infection, inflammation or neoplastic process.  N.B.
Per conversation with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **], possible oral infection is
suspected which may the cause of these enlarged lymph nodes.
3. Bilateral mastoid sinus fluid, left more extensive than the
right. Please clinically correlate with symptoms of
inflammation.

[**6-5**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Worsening right lower and upper lobe
pneumonia.

[**6-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Resolving right lower lobe pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo M with AML s/p recent chemo presenting with febrile
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
.
# Febrile neutropenia/drug allergies: Given his extensive
allergy history, both allergy and infectious disease were
consulted.  He was given broad empiric coverage with aztreonam
(dosed via de-sensitization protocol to goal dose 2000mg q8h),
Daptomycin 600mg q24, and Flagyl 500mg q8. Source was initially
unclear but [**Name (NI) 74311**] did show thickening in the ileal-cecal
junction so there was a question of colitis vs. PNA that was
seen to be worsening on interval CXR.
.
# Pneumonia: As described above, the patient continued to have
fevers throughout his hospitalization with a worsening PNA on
CXR despite treatemnt with Aztreonam, Daptomycin and Flagyl.
Levofloxacin was later added. He developed an oxygen
requirement, requiring 4 L or NRB.
.
# Thrombocytopenia/ nose bleed: The patients platelets were 6 at
the time of admission, and he also had an episode of epistaxis.
He was transfused for goal PLT >20 while actively bleeding.
Once bleeding stopped, goal PLT was >10. HLA testing was done as
patient was intermittantly refractory to platelet transfusions.
.
# AML: At the time of admission, he was day 17 following his
15th cycle of Dacogen. Voriconazole prophylaxis was continued,
but doxycycline prophylaxis was held g
