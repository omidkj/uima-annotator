Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16646**] was admitted and underwent persantine MIBI on
[**2190-7-16**] which revealed a moderate fixed perfusion defect of the
inferior wall - no reversible perfusion defects were identified.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 56%. The
EKG portion showed approximately 1 mm lateral and apical ST
depressions which were 0.5 mm additional over baseline ST
depressions. She experienced no angina or shortness of breath.
Further evaluation included an echocardiogram which found a
severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets, severe AS
with mild AI. The aortic peak and mean gradients were 73 and 46
mm Hg. There was severe mitral
annular calcification with mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral
regurgitation. Her LVEF was estimated at 60%. The ECHO was also
notable for mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with
moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation. Subsequent cardiac
cathterization on [**2190-7-19**] revealed severe three vessel disease
and severe AS. The [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] was estimated at 0.7 cm2 with a
gradient of 49 mmHg. Angiography showed a 60% ostial left main
stenosis; 50% lesion in the mid LAD, 90% obtuse marginal
stenosis, and 80% lesion in the RCA. Given her renal
insufficiency, no LVG was performed. Based on the above
findings, cardiac surgery was consulted. Further evaluation
included vein mapping and carotid ultrasound which found no
significant disease of the internal carotid arteries.

On [**2190-7-20**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed an aortic valve replacement
with a 19-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
porcine valve and coronary bypass grafting x3 with the left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal branch of the
circumflex, and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary
artery. There were no complications. Postop TEE showed no AI, 1+
MR with an LVEF of 50%. After the operation, she was brought to
the CSRU. Within 24 hours, she was extubated. She maintained
good hemodynamics but initially experienced low urine output.
Her urine output eventually improved with volume and PRBC's. She
was transfused to maintain hematocrit over 30%. Her renal
function remained relatively stable - creatinine peaked to 2.4.
She gradually started on Lasix. Over several days, her clinical
status stabilized. She was noted to be in a first degree AV
block with occasional junctional episodes - beta blockade was
therefore initially withheld. On postoperative day 7, she
transferred to the SDU. Periods of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation were noted for which low dose betablockade was
resumed. K and Mg levels were monitored and repleted per
protocol. She remained mostly in a NSR. Low dose beta blockade
was continued. Her last episode of AF was noted on POD #8.  She
continued to require diuresis. By discharge, her oxygen
saturations were 98% on 2L nasal cannula. She was also noted to
have a leukocytosis, white count peaked to 18K. She remained
afebrile.  All lines were removed and cultures remained
negative. By discharge, her white count improved to 13K. After
several more days of obsrvation, she was cleared for discharge
to rehab on POD #10.
