Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Once stabilized in the

laparotomy and splenectomy. There were no intraoperative
complications. He remained in the Trauma ICU for several days
for close monitoring given his injuries. He was noted to have
dyspnea and increased oxygen requirements; chest imaging
revealed a loculated left sided effusion. Thoracic surgery was
consulted and he was taken to the operating room on [**8-6**] for left
VATS decortication.

Cultures of the pleural fluid and of his chest wound were sent
which revealed a staphylococcal infection. It was recommended by
Infectious Disease that he be treated with a 6 week course of
Nafcillin. A PICC line was placed and plans were made or
discharge home with IV antibiotics.

He was given the appropriate vaccinations due to the splenectomy
prior to his discharge. Follow up is needed in both Trauma and
Thoracic clinic.
