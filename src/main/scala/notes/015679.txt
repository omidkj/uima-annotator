Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
elevated LFTs


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
AICD cardioversion on [**10-8**]


History of Present Illness:
72-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant
for VF arrest s/p AICD placement in [**2102**], CHF with EF of 15-20%,
afib, DM, COPD, HTN, ischemic hepatitis, and recent admissions
to ICU first for syncope in setting of AFIB with RVR in [**Month (only) 216**]
then for altered mental status in early [**Month (only) **] (D/C [**2115-7-26**]),
now tranfered from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab because feeling ill for the past
few weeks found to have AST 1733, ALT 1164 in the ED without
obstructive picture on LFTs.
.
Pt reports he has not felt well over the past few weeks. In
particular, he reports he went to rehab 4 weeks ago from his
last stay at [**Hospital1 18**]. He says he was regaining strength for the
first two weeks but then in the last two weeks has lost all that
strength again and feels like he is back to when he was admitted
to rehab. He says his weakness is particularly prominent in his
legs. He reports occasional SOB when walking that has also
worsened somewhat in the last 2 weeks. He denies chest pain,
diaphoresis, or nausea this these sx. He started having a
prominent itching sensation around the time he was admitted to
rehab, mostly on his arms. He has been itching his arms a lot in
the last 4 weeks and has created multiple scabs on his arms from
the itching. He denies thinking that his skin is more yellow. He
denies nausea although told ED he had some. He says he hasn't
had much of an appetitie recently and hasn't eaten anything by
mouth but also reports he has been feed daily through his G-tube
while at rehab. He is not able to clearly articulate why he has
a G-tube. He isn't sure why the rehab sent him to the hospital
today, but is able to articulate that they found his liver to be
inflammed on the labs from the ED here.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.1 90 102/67 25 96% RA. AST/ALT
markedly elevated with only mild AP elevation and normal Tbili
but with significantly elevated INR. WBC WNL and RUQ U/S showed
mild abnormalities but no evidence of cholecystitis. Surgery was
consulted re gallbladder and said no evidence of cholecystitis
or surgical need. CXR showed "stable" R pleural efffusion with
no evidence of PNA. ED concerned that UA consistent with a UTI.
Pt was given IV Cipro/Flagyl as well as zofran. Having
intermittent nose bleeds in ED. Gtube patent. Pt with episodic
desats to 80s but O2 sat probe unreliable. Most Recent Vitals:
2235: T 97.7 HR 92 BP 92/53 RR 20.

Pertinent Results:
[**2115-10-6**] LIVER ULTRASOUND
Son[**Name (NI) 493**] images of the right upper quadrant demonstrate
normal
liver echogenicity, without focal lesions. The midline
structures including the pancreas are not well seen due to
overlying gastrostomy tube. Normal hepatopetal flow is seen
within the main portal vein. There are pleural effusions, right
greater than left, a small amount of perihepatic ascites.
The gallbladder is collapsed with an abnormally thickened wall -
likely
reflecting liver disease. There is no pericholecystic fluid. The
common bile duct is normal in caliber measuring 4 mm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Decompressed gallbladder with thick wall, likely reflecting
liver disease.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with
small amount of perihepatic ascites.

[**2115-10-7**] ECHO
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with severe global hypokinesis (LVEF =
20 %). Systolic function of apical segments is relatively
preserved. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular cavity enlargement with severe global
left ventricular hyopkinesis and right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
hypertension.
