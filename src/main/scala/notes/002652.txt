[**2155-2-3**] Intraop TEE
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. A patent foramen
ovale is present.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferoapical
and anteroapical hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). Doppler
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis.
3. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a very small pericardial effusion. The pericardium
may be thickened.
POST-CPB: On infusion of epi and milrinone briefly. A-paced for
bigeminy briefly. Improved biventricular systolic function after
CPB with the LVEF = 40-45%. The anterior and inferior walls are
improved. The MR is now trace. The aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo male history of Diabetes Mellitus 2, Hypertension,
Hyperlipidemia, Coronary artery disease  s/p recent cath at
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2155-1-22**] after NSTEMI found to have three vessel
disease with CABG planned on [**2155-2-7**] that presented with chest
pain and shortness of breath consistent with unstable angina,
acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation, and acute on
chronic renal failure. On [**2155-2-3**] he was taken to the operating
room and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x four with
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
coronary  artery; reverse saphenous vein graft from aorta to
first diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein graft
from aorta to first obtuse marginal coronary artery; as well as
reverse saphenous vein graft from aorta to posterior left
ventricular coronary artery with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Cross clamp time=
83 minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass Time=110 minutes. [**2155-2-4**] he
awoke neurologically intact and was weaned to extubation. The
following day he was reintubated secondary to hypercapnea. All
lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion. POD#4 he
was weaned to extubation successfully.
Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin/ and diuresis were initiated. All
narcotics were discontinued due to postoperative delerium and
confusion.Renal was consulted for acute on chronic renal
failure. He continued to progress, mental status improved and on
POD#7  he was transferred to the step down unit for further
monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted for strength and
mobility. Pt was recommended to go to rehab, but refused. Pt
decided to sign out against medical advice His BUN and cratinine
remain high. He is making good urine. BUN 112 / Creatine 4.1.
Renal recommended laasi and zaroxalyn.  All follow up
appointments were advised.
