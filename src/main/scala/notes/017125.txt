hospital on [**2121-1-20**], after the acute onset of abdominal
pain.  The patient was in her usual state of health until
this day around 5:00 p.m. when the patient developed the
acute onset of epigastric pain and violent nonbloody emesis
after eating a meal of macaroni and cheese.  The patient
states that the pain was ten out of ten, did not radiate to
her back, but did radiate to her bilateral flanks. It was
associated with increased shortness of breath, no chest pain,
light-headedness or syncope.

The patient's husband called 911. When she was taken to the
outside hospital, her amylase was 3861, white blood cell
count 23.0, hematocrit 45.0, normal liver function tests.
The patient had temperature of 98.2, blood pressure 135/72,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 98% ? In room air.
The patient had an abdominal CT which showed mild acute
pancreatitis with no gallstones or other pancreatic
complications.  The right upper quadrant ultrasound was done
that revealed no evidence of gallstones (suboptimal study).
The patient then had a repeat abdominal CT on [**2121-1-23**], which
showed necrosis of the pancreatic head with peripancreatic
inflammatory changes.  The amylase had trended down to the
80s over four days and the patient also had significant
decrease in her abdominal pain.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2121-1-25**], for question of endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography as well as for failing respiratory
status at the outside hospital.  The patient had a chest
x-ray that showed bilateral pleural effusions, status post
aggressive intravenous fluids.  The patient was noted to have
increased wheezing on physical examination.  She was given 20
mg intravenous Lasix with good effect.  The patient was also
given stress dose steroids of Solu-Medrol, however, she had
hallucinations from this.  Her paO2 was 61 mmHg.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pancreatitis - The patient with history of necrotizing
pancreatitis of unclear etiology.  Normal liver function
tests, amylase and lipase and hematocrit of 40.2.  Unclear
family history of childhood pancreatic fibrosis but at the
time of presentation, the patient is 64 years old and this
may be unrelated acute event.  The patient may have passed a
gallstone given her age, gender, clinical history with acute
onset of severe pain after a fatty meal.

The patient was continued on Imipenem for necrotizing
pancreatitis which was discontinued on [**2121-1-29**].  The patient
was kept NPO except for most medications and ice chips.  She
did not require placement of nasogastric tube.  The patient
initially was able to tolerate gradually increasing diet
including sips which was then advanced to full clears and
soft solids.  However, on [**2121-1-31**], the patient noted
epigastric tenderness to light palpation after eating and the
patient was again made NPO.  The patient continued to do well
after she was made NPO with a goal of restarting clears on
[**2121-2-2**].

The patient was continued on TPN throughout her hospital
course with the long term plan being that the patient will
likely need TPN for at least seven to ten days postdischarge
in order to meet h
