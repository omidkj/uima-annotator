History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83984**] is 37 year old man, with a history of DM, who
presented to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2117-10-21**] after a
syncopal episode. There was a question of a seizure in the field
prior to arrival. Per his family he had a upper respiratory
illness (starting [**10-12**]) with sneezing, cough  for 7-10 days
with decreased PO intake and general malasie prior to
presentation. He was in shock on admission, was intubated and
started on levophed and Tamiflu, Levaquin, and Vancomycin. H1N1
was originally suspected, however Flu swab has remained
negative. He developed MSSA in the blood cultures and his
antibiotics were narrowed to naficillin. He remained on
vasopressors until [**10-24**].

His course was complicated by ARF with Cr of 1.9 worsening to
7.2 thought to be [**1-4**] ATN and requiring HD for hyperkalemia to
6. He had a HD line placed on [**10-24**].  He also had intermittant
A. fib treated with Cardizem as well as a wide complex
tachycardia. Echo showed a preserved EF without evidence of
vegitation.

On transport on [**2117-10-27**] he was paralysized and given boluses of
versed and fentanyl. HR remained tachycardic in the 140s.

Imaging:
ECG Study Date of [**2117-10-27**]  10:53:18 PM
Sinus tachycardia. Incomplete right bundle-branch block.
Non-specific
ST-T wave changes. The P-R interval is 160 milliseconds.

ECG Study Date of [**2117-11-4**]  3:16:42 AM

atrio-ventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia but cannot exclude
orthodromic atrio-ventricular reciprocating tachycardia.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-10-28**]
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Evaluation for
infection is
limited on CT. Sinus disease. Fluid within the mastoid air cells

bilaterally.
.
CT TORSO W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-10-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Evaluation limited due to lack of IV contrast and streak
artifact from
overlying arms. Multifocal pneumonia as seen on recent chest
x-ray.
2. Fatty liver. Otherwise, non-contrast appearance of the
abdomen and pelvis is unremarkable except for small amount of
free fluid.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY [**2117-11-1**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-11-16**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**11-15**], there is little
overall change in the appearance of the cardiomediastinal
silhouette with extensive right paratracheal thickening.
Extensive left lung consolidation has somewhat decreased since
the previous study. Also, the area of opacification in the right
lung has improved.
.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-11-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive confluent T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities throughout
the centrum semiovale and peritrigonal regions without
restricted diffusion. The findings most likely represent
sequelae of a systemic metabolic/hypoxic insult with additional
considerations to include infectious or HIV-related processes
such as PML or viral encephalopathy. Given the marked
hypotension 3 weeks prior, the findings could represent evolving
watershed infarcts with pseudonormalization of the ADC map or
even osmotic demyelination in the appropriate context.
Correlation with the patient's history and followup examination
with gadolinium administration is recommended in further
evaluation.
2. Bilateral mastoid air cell effusions as well as maxillary and
sphenoid
sinus disease, which may in part be related to recent
intubation.
.
MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2117-11-22**]
IMPRESSION: Patchy foci of enhancement throughout the signal
abnormality
within the centrum semiovale with primary differential
considerations again including metabolic/hypoxic processes. The
findings could relate to subacute infarcts relating to prior
watershed event or osmotic demyelination. Correlation with CSF
sampling is recommended.
.
EMG Study Date of [**2117-11-24**]
Clinical Interpretation: Complex abnormal study. There is
electrophysiologic evidence for a mild sensorimotor neuropathy
with demyelinating and axonal features. Although this can be
seen in diabetes, the EMG reveals ongoing denervation and
chronic reinnervation in the upper and lower extremities,
suggesting a subacute process. The differential diagnosis
includes critical illness polyneuropathy and axonal variant of
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] syndrome. An incidental moderate median
neuropathy at the left wrist is noted (as in carpal tunnel
syndrome).
