Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year old female
with known coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2170**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia, who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2175-5-19**], for cardiac catheterization.  By report, the
patient suffered a myocardial infarction in [**2170**].  Subsequent
follow-up stress test in [**2172-9-25**], demonstrated
inferior ischemia; at that point, the patient was
uninterested in surgical intervention and was therefore
treated medically.  The patient was in her usual state of
health until approximately one month prior to admission when
she noted gradual onset of left arm pain and chest tightness
in association with activity.  The patient was evaluated by
her primary care physician and was subsequently scheduled for
a stress test.  While awaiting the stress test, the patient
presented to an urgent care facility on [**2175-5-17**], with chief
complaint of increasing shortness of breath, productive cough
and chest pain.  The patient reported cold symptoms and fever
with associated cough times two to three days.  The patient
was treated with Albuterol for suspected bronchial infection;
however, upon administration, the patient became dizzy,
tachycardic, diaphoretic and was noted to be hypotensive.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, where
an electrocardiogram showed diffuse inferior and anterior
ST-T wave changes.  Troponin levels at that point were noted
to be positive at 10.0; the patient's CK was noted to be 125
and her MB was 9.0 with subsequent values of 104/7.8 and
113/7.5, respectively.  Echocardiogram demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 40 to 45% with an apical aneurysm.  The
patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2175-5-19**], for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2170**].
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Colon cancer, status post resection in [**2170**].
5.  Status post appendectomy.
6.  Status post partial hysterectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Lasix.
3.  Isordil.
4.  Captopril.
5.  Lopressor.
6.  Zocor.
7.  Magnesium Oxide.
8.  Guaifenesin.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine, Penicillin, Sulfa, Biaxin, Lipitor.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in senior housing
development in [**Location (un) **], [**State 350**].  The patient has one son.
The patient works as an office assistant.  The patient is
independent in her activities of daily living.  No notable
smoking history.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the C-Medicine
service on [**2175-5-19**].  Cardiac catheterization conducted on
[**2175-5-19**], demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease
with 90% stenosis in the mid left anterior descending, 90%
proximal occlusion of the OM1, and total occlusion of the
right coronary artery.  Normal ventricular function was noted
with a recorded ejection fraction of 51%.  Following
extensive discussion with the patient regarding the benefits
and risks of surgery, the patient elected to undergo coronary
artery bypass graft procedure which was scheduled for
[**2175-5-22**].

On [**2175-5-22**], the patient underwent a four vessel coronary
artery bypass graft procedure with anastomosis from the left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to posterior descending, saphenous vein
graft to the OM and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
The patient's pericardium was left open; lines placed
intraoperatively included arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter
and CVP/RA catheter, both ventricular and atrial pacing wires
were placed; both mediastinal and left pleural tubes were
placed.  The patient was subsequently transferred from the
operating room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit
intubated, for further evaluation and management.  Shortly
following transfer, the patient failed initial attempt at
extubation but was successfully weaned and extubated several
hours later.  The patient remained stable under observation
in the CSRU through postoperative day number two, at which
point her chest tube and pacing wires were removed without
complication and the patient was subsequently cleared for
transfer to the floor for further evaluation and management.
The patient was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic
service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  The
patient's postoperative course was uneventful and she
progressed well clinically.  Physical therapy evaluation
suggested that the patient would benefit from postdischarge
home physical therapy which was subsequently arranged for
her.  On postoperative day number three, the patient's Foley
catheter was successfully removed and the patient was at this
point noted to be independently productive of adequate
amounts of urine for the duration of her stay.  Given
persistent coarse breath sounds in the patient's lung
examination, routine screening chest x-ray was obtained which
demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis.  The patient was subsequently begun on a
fourteen day course of Levofloxacin, on which she remains
upon discharge.  The patient was successfully advanced to a
full regular diet and was noted to have adequate pain control
provided via oral pain medications.  On postoperative day
number five, the patient was noted to have significant
constipation secondary to opioid administration.  Following
aggressive administration of Colace and Dulcolax, the patient
was noted to pass stool freely and was subsequently
independently productive of adequate bowel movements through
the duration of her stay.  The patient was subsequently
cleared for discharge to home with services on postoperative
day number six, [**2175-5-28**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to home
with services and with instructions for follow-up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q12hours times ten days.
2.  Potassium Chloride 20 meq p.o. q12hours times ten days.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.

incisions afterwards; no bathing or swimming until further
notice.
2.  The patient has been advised to limit physical activity;
no heavy exertion.
3.  The patient has been scheduled for home physical therapy
for continued strength and endurance training, as well as
with a home health aid for wound checks once daily.
4.  No driving while taking pain medications.
5.  Follow-up with primary care physician within one to two
weeks following discharge.
6.  Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] within four weeks
