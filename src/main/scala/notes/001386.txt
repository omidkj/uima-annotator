Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the medical intensive care unit in
hemodynamically stable condition, with ongoing dark stools.
.
.
# GI bleeding.  Pt is a a 68 M with h/o recurrent GI bleeding
from AVMs, CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF45%) who presented [**12-30**] with 4d
of dark colored stools, stomach upset, and dyspnea, found to
have HCT of 26.  He was felt to be hemodynamically stable (97.2
94/39 64 18 98%RA).  NGL was negative in ED, initial EKG showed
ST depression and TWI.  Creatinine was slightly elevated, K was
6 on admission. Pt received insulin/bicarb/calcium gluconate, 2U
PRBC, and 2L NS in the Emergency Department.  He was then
transferred to the MICU (HR 65 BP 119/32 100%2L), seen by the GI
service, and transfused 2U [**Name (NI) **] (pt received a total of 4U
PRBC), with hct stabilizing at 32.  EGD performed on [**12-31**]
revealed a non-bleeding duodenal ulcer.
.
Pt was transferred to the general medical floor.  Repeat HCT was
stable 32-34.  He continued to have dark stools without frank
bleeding, despite stable HCT and SBPs.  H. pylori serologies
were obtained which were unremarkable.  Pt was treated with
sucralfate and [**Hospital1 **] protonix as per GI service recommendation.
He was discharged home on [**2163-1-3**] with instructions to follow-up
with his gastroenterologist within 2-3 weeks.  In addition, he
was instructed to follow-up with his primary care physician
[**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2 weeks regarding restarting his Bumex and xaroxolyn as
below.
.
.
# cardiac:
# ischemia - pt presnted with dynamic EKG changes while in ED
(deeping of inverted T's and ST depressions), this was felt
likely to represent demand ischemia in the setting of GI
bleeding and anemia.  His symptoms of SOB were resolved s/p 2U
PRBC, and did not recur during his admission.  Pt was seen by
the cardiology service in the ED who recommended correcting his
anemia, and managing him medically.
.
Pt's aspirin and plavix were initially held, but were restarted
once pt's hematocrit stabilized in light of his s/p recent
placement of cypher stent in [**5-8**].  Pt was instructed to
follow-up with his cardiologist within 4 weeks regarding the
specific duration of his plavix therapy in light of his multiple
recurrent GI bleeding episodes.  Pt was otherwise discharged on
his prior cardiac regimen of toprol 50mg qdaily, imdur 60 mg
qdaily, zetia 10mg po qdaily, and simvastatin 80 mg po qdaily.
.
# pump - pt with h/o CHF (EF 45%), on standing bumex, zaroxlyn
and zestril at home.  these medications were held in the MICU
[**2-4**] UGIB and ARF.  Zestril was restarted prior to [**Month/Day (2) **].  Pt
was discharged home with instructions not to take his bumex or
zaroxlyn until seen by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] whose nurse practitioner he
had an appointment 2d after [**Name10 (NameIs) **],
