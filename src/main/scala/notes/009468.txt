which showed severe left main coronary artery disease with a
70% left coronary stenosis, and mild disease of the other
coronary arteries.  Her ejection fraction was noted to be
only 34%.  Because of the severe left main coronary artery
disease, cardiac surgery was consulted and the patient was
preopped for surgery.  On hospital day #2, [**12-27**], Ms
[**Known lastname 4281**] was taken to the Operating Room for a coronary artery
bypass graft.  Please refer to the previously dictated
operative note by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from [**2101-12-27**].

mammary artery was connected to the left anterior descending
and saphenous vein grafts were connected to the obtuse
marginal and the diagonal arteries.  She had cardiopulmonary
bypass for 56 minutes and the aorta was crossclamped for 46
minutes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
sent to the Recovery Room intubated with Propofol,
Epinephrine and Phenylephrine drips.  Ms [**Known lastname 41702**] drips were
gradually weaned over the next couple of days.  On
postoperative day #2, when she was finally normotensive
without any drips, she was extubated and subsequently
transferred to the floor.  Ms [**Known lastname 41702**] floor course was
unremarkable.  She did quite well in fact, and her only main
issue was physical therapy.

cleared after doing the stairs by physical therapy and on
postoperative day #5, [**1-1**], Ms [**Known lastname 4281**] was discharged
