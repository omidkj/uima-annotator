Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14037**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation on [**2189-12-21**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 48 year-old male with h/o ESRD, HTN, DM, CAD,
CVA, and drug abuse who presented to the ED on [**12-20**] after
falling out of wheelchair at nursing home x 2.  The night PTA,
pt was trying to get to a urinal in a dark room, and suffered a
mechanical fall. No LOC, no head trauma at that time. The
morning of admission, the pt dropped a cigarette, and fell while
trying to pick it up. His head hit the ground, and his chest
struck a piece of furniture. Since the 2nd fall, he reports
constant chest pain (originally [**7-8**]). He denies LOC during
either fall. He was admitted to the floor, had an episode of
hypoxic respiratory failure thought secondary to pulmonary
edema, and was subsequently intubated and transferred to the
ICU.  During his stay in the ICU, he was aggressively diuresed
and then self-extubated today.

The pt now complains of [**2-5**] chest pain (but says he only has
pain "when he thinks about it"), but denies SOB, N/V. He also
c/o bilateral shoulder pain.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD, h/o NSTEMI in [**8-3**], unknown if followed by cards, cath
history
2. Type 1 DM - followed at [**Last Name (un) **], complicated by neprophathy,
retinopathy, neuropathy (last A1c 8.8% on [**4-2**])
3. Severe PVD - s/p L SFA stent in [**11-2**]
4. ESRD - s/p fistula placement, will start dialysis in near
future according to DC summary from [**Hospital1 2025**].
5. left foot cellulitis
6. h/o IVDU
7. Renal artery stenosis: patent single R renal artery, 3
diseased left renal arteries s/p L renal artery stents
8. "refractory" HTN
9. h/o CVA (left post internal capsular infract in [**8-3**]) cannot
ambulate
10. hypercholesterolemia
11. Chronic Hep C
12. Panic d/o

CT HEAD ([**12-20**]): No intracranial hemorrhage is identified. No
mass effect is seen. The ventricles are symmetric, there is no
shift of normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. Within the right basal ganglia,
right putamen, and within the left corona radiata, there are
several tiny foci of low attenuation, suggesting chronic lacunar
infarcts. The soft tissue and osseous structures are within
normal limits.
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is identified.
2. Tiny foci of low attenuation within the right putamen, basal
ganglia, and left corona radiata are noted, which may represent
chronic lacunar infarcts.
.
CXR ([**12-20**]): The heart is upper limits of normal for size. There
are increased interstitial markings bilaterally. Pulmonary
vasculature is probably normal. There are no effusions, and
there is no pneumothorax. No fractures are identified. Osseous
structures are otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
Increased bilateral interstitial markings without evidence of
traumatic injury or pneumothorax. Findings may be due to chronic
interstitial lung disease or atypical infection. Follow up
radiographs or comparison to prior studies if available is
recommended.
.
Echo ([**12-21**]):
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a
focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No
resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Based on [**2180**]  AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be
based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical  quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no  aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with  trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
48 yo male with Type 1 DM, ESRD awaiting dialysis initiation,
CAD with recent NSTEMI, CVA, and HTN admitted with acute onset
of substernal chest pain and hypoxia in the setting of HTN. It
is likely that the etiology of his hypoxic respiratory failure
was from pulmonary edema resulting from the combination of
diastolic dysfunction and hypertension.
.
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt suffered hypoxic respiratory
failure following admission in the setting of severe
hypertension and probable flash pulmonary edema. He required
intubation and was monitored in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] overnight before self
extubating the following day. Since that time, he has not
experienced any respiratory distress. He was quickly weaned off
of oxygen with saturations remaining in the mid to high 90s on
room air. In consideration of his respiratory distress, a TEE
was obtained in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] which was negative for dissection
