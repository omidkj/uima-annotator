History of Present Illness:
76-year-old woman who previously had been admitted for
management of atrial fibrillation and polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia.  The latter was thought to
be due to QT prolongation from disopyramide, leading to torsade
de pointes.  She had no further episodes of VT.  Regarding her
atrial fibrillation, this was managed with both amiodarone and
diltiazem to control her rate.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor after
discharge on [**2125-2-13**], showed atrial fibrillation at rates
of 60-110.  During the hospitalization also, she was discovered
to have severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal regional LV
systolic function. Low normal LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Characteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral
valve leaflets with fused commissures and tethering of leaflet
motion. Moderate mitral annular calcification. Moderate valvular
MS (MVA 1.0-1.5cm2) Moderate (2+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass
1. The left atrium is dilated. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). with mild global
RV free wall hypokinesis.
3.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
regurgitation is 3 + when the blood pressure is 135/80 and the
PA pressures are 60/26. Findings discussed with Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 171**] ( present in the room). Decision made to leave the
tricuspid valve alone.
6. There is a small pericardial effusion.
7. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on
[**2125-4-13**] at 800am.
Post bypass
First attempt at separation from CPB complicated by AV
dissociation. Emergently went back on CPB.
Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of epinephrine,
milrinone and norepinephrine.
1. Unable to assess LV systolic function due to very poor
transgastric views.
2. Mechanical valve seen in the mitral position. Leaflets move
well and valve appears well seated. Washing jets seen.
3. Tricuspid regurgitation is mild to moderate.
4. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
5. The left atrial appendage has been ligated.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient after extensive
thoracic
surgery.
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2125-4-14**],
obtained 09:30 a.m.
The intra-aortic balloon pump was repositioned and is currently
approximately 1.8 cm below the expected position of the roof of
the aortic arch. The Swan-Ganz catheter tip is at the right main
