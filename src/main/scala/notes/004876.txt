Admission Date:  [**2155-4-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2155-4-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2107-10-19**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain, shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 year-old
female with a history of hypertension, ITP status post
splenectomy, and a history of supraventricular tachycardia
for which she underwent an electrophysiologic study at [**Hospital1 1444**] [**2155-1-8**].  Her study
demonstrated duel pathway physiology and a diseased
His-Purkinje system.  No supraventricular tachycardia or
ventricular tachycardia could be induced, however, and no
intervention could be initially undertaken.  The patient had
a near syncopal event on the telemetry floor the next day in
the setting in which her heart rate decreased from 120 to 60.
The patient had an echocardiogram at that time, which
disclosed severe left ventricular dysfunction.  Cardiac MRI
confirmed markedly depressed left ventricular function, but
failed to show any scarring/infarction, therefore the patient
was thought to have not ischemic cardiomyopathy.  Given her
near syncope and cardiomyopathy the decision was made to
place a DDD pacemaker.  Some difficulty was encountered in
placing the RV lead, per EP report.  The patient did well
postoperatively, however, and had no complications until
today at 2:30 p.m. when she awoke from a nap with sharp chest
pain that radiated to her right shoulder.  The patient also
experienced shortness of breath.  She went to an outside
hospital where initially concern was for a pulmonary embolus.
The patient underwent CT scan, which demonstrated a large
pericardial effusion.  During her time there she developed
progressively distended neck veins and hemodynamic
instability with systolic blood pressure 60 to 90.  The
patient was transported urgently to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin and Percocet.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg po q.d.
2.  Atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.  ITP status post
splenectomy, hypertension, history of supraventricular
tachycardia status post EP study [**2155-1-8**] with diseased
His-Purkinje system.  The patient is status post placement of
DDD pacemaker.  Nonischemic cardiomyopathy.  Echocardiogram
[**2155-1-8**] disclosed EF of 25%, severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis, no pericardial effusion.  Glaucoma,
L4-L5 ruptured disc.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative for tobacco, alcohol and drugs.
The patient lives in [**Location 86**] with her daughter and boyfriend.
She has three children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  [**Name (NI) **] sister and father have glaucoma.
Mother died at the age of 35 of an aneurysm and had a history
of hypertension.  Father died of myocardial infarction at age
67.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General, alert, patient acutely
distressed.  Temperature 97.5.  Blood pressure 115/93.  Heart
rate 107.  Respiratory rate 24.  O2 sat 100% on room air.
HEENT mucous membranes are moist.  Oropharynx is clear.  Neck
supple.  Markedly distended neck veins.  Heart, distant heart
sounds.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen
soft, nondistended, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 21, hematocrit
33.3.  Differential showed 92.5% neutrophils, 5.2%
lymphocytes.  Chemistries were within normal limits with a
BUN and creatinine of 13 and 0.7.  INR 1.4.  Initial CK at
outside hospital 56, MB less then 0.5, troponin less then
0.05.  Serum tox screen negative.  Urine tox screen negative.
Electrocardiogram sinus tachycardia at 111 beats per minute,
normal PR intervals, prolonged QTC, normal axis, left
ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, T wave
inversions in 2, 3 and AVF, V5 and V6, poor R wave
progression.  Left bundle branch block is old.  Chest x-ray
slight cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax.  Echocardiogram
preliminary read disclosed pericardial effusion greater then
2 cm, left ventricular ejection fraction 25%, total RARV
collapse.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 47 year-old female who presents
with acute cardiac tamponade.  The patient is taken
emergently to catheterization laboratory for a
pericardiocentesis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Initial right heart catheterization
revealed elevated right heart filling pressures with
equalization of pressures across the [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].  The RA mean
pressure was 14 mmHg with an RVEDP and a pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 15 mmHg.  Initial arterial pressure
measured revealed an aortic pressure of 118/72/89 mmHg.  The
cardiac output on a Dopamine drip at 2 micrograms per
kilogram per minute was preserved at 7.4 meters per minute.

A pericardial drain was placed through the subxiphoid
approach. Initially pericardial pressure was found to be 15
mmHg, 350 cc of frankly blood fluid was removed with a
subsequent decrease in the mean RA pressure to 8 mmHg, a
decrease in the mean pericardial pressure to 3 mmHg and a
rise in the arterial blood pressure to 165/84/114 mmHg.

A follow up echocardiogram performed in the catheterization
laboratory demonstrated complete resolution of the
pericardial effusions.  The patient was also noted to have a
left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%.

The patient underwent interrogation of pacemaker.  Left
bundle branch block pattern was elicited.  Analysis suggested
that the V lead was still present in the RV.  The patient's
CT scans from the outside hospital were reviewed.  There was
no definitive evidence of RV perforation by the V lead.

The following day the patient underwent repeat CT scan of the
chest with cardiac gaiting.  There was no definitive evidence
of pacer wire perforation.  Further analysis of the
echocardiogram done in the Emergency Department on [**4-19**],
however, suggested that the tip of the pacing wire in the
right ventricle appeared possibly through the RV free wall.
Therefore it was decided that the patient would go to the EP
laboratory for lead revision under fluoroscopic guidance.  On
[**4-21**] the patient underwent this procedure without
complications.

Pericardial fluid was sent to the laboratory for cytology and
culture.  Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Cultures were unrevealing.  Serum [**Doctor First Name **] was negative.  TSH was
within normal limits.

On [**4-23**] the pericardial drain was discontinued without
difficulties.  Echocardiogram did not show evidence of
recurrent pericardial effusion.

The patient was noted to have drop in hematocrit from low 30s
to 23.  The etiology of hematocrit drop was unclear, since
echocardiogram did not demonstrate accumulation of
pericardial fluid.  The patient was administered 3 units of
packed red blood cells.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2155-4-23**].
Echocardiogram on [**2155-4-25**] disclosed trivial
physiologic pericardial effusion.  Compared with prior study
of [**4-24**] there has been no significant change.

It was decided that the patient was stable for discharge on
[**4-25**].  The patient will follow up in the Device Clinic on
[**4-28**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is instructed to return
to the Emergency Department should she experience recurrent
chest pain or shortness of breath.
