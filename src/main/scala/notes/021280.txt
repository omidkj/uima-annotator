Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2181-10-17**]
Stenting of the left main coronary artery [**2181-10-18**]

History of Present Illness:
66 y/o man with H/O CAD, s/p CABG in [**2169**], s/p prior
catheterization showing the LIMA-LAD is the only remaining
patent graft, s/p ICD in [**2177**] for primary prevention against
sudden cardiac death, and s/p right upper lobectomy for lung
cancer in [**2172**] with adjunctive chemotherapy and radiation. He
has done well over the past few years until about 2-3 weeks ago
when his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1911**], interrorgted his
device and found he was having numerous episodes of VT (100 or
so episodes without ICD firing). His verapamil was discontinued,
and he was started on Quinaglute (did not start amiodarone due
to lung issues). He returned and was found to have no VT.
However, on [**2181-10-15**] he presented to [**Hospital6 20592**] with shortness of breath and orthopnea; he also stated
that he has been increasingly dyspneic with exertion over the
past few weeks. His blood pressure was down in the 80-90
systolic range and his BNP was in the 700's. He had lower
extremity edema. He was admitted, had no biomarker evidence of
MI, was diuresed, and underwent an echocardiogram yesterday
showing an EF of 30% which was essentially unchanged, but he was
found to have new 3+ mitral regurgitation and hypokinesis of the
inferior wall.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] had the patient transferred here for right and
left heart catheterization.

ROS: He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, DVT, PE,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of
systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Hyperlipidemia
3. CAD, s/p CABG in [**2169**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-Ramus, SVG-RCA), s/p
cath on [**2177-9-10**] found to have totally occluded SVG-Ramus and
SVG-RCA. The native RCA was totally occluded; he had a 30% left
main lesion and a 80% ramus lesion. It was at this time he was
found to have a lesion in his left subclavian and had a stent
placed there.
4. Cardiomyopathy/chronic LV systolic heart failure with EF of
30% s/p ICD in [**2177**].
5. Lung cancer, s/p right upper lobectomy, chemo, & XRT
6. Asthma
7. Gout
8. Diabetes mellitus

Social History:

smoking in [**2172**]. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

There is a family history of CAD: his father had an MI, mother
had a CVA.

CXR [**2181-10-16**]
No appreciable interval change. Patient has had right upper lung
and chest wall resection. There is mild scarring in the left mid
lung unchanged over four years, no pleural effusion or pulmonary
consolidation noted. Heart size normal. Transvenous right atrial
pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads follow
their expected courses unchanged and continuous from the left
pectoral pacemaker.

ECG [**2181-10-17**] 1:46:26 AM
Sinus rhythm and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with ventricular
rate 143 bpm. The limb leads are misattached. There is evidence
for prior inferoposterior and lateral myocardial infarction.
Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2177-10-30**] paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has appeared. Otherwise,
no apparent diagnostic interim change.

Cardiac catheterization [**2181-10-17**]
  1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
system revealed three vessel native coronary artery disease. The
LMCA was heavily calicified with ostial 70% stenosis and distal
40% stenosis; there was some pressure dampening when the LMCA
was engaged with the JL4 diagnostic catheter. The LAD had
proximal diffuse disease, was heavily calcified, and had
competitive flow in the mid-LAD; there were apical collaterals
to the RCA. The LCX was moderately calcified with a hazy origin
stenosis of at least mild-moderate severity. A high OM1 had
diffuse severe disease after a proximal taper. There was a major
patent OM2. The OM3/LPL was of modest caliber. The distal AV
groove CX supplied an atrial branch and faint collaterals to the
RCA. The RCA had a proximal total occlusion with faint filling
of AMs.
  2. Selective venous conduit angiography was not performed as
the SVG's were known to be occluded. Selective conduit
arteriography revealed a patent LIMA arising adjacent to the
thyrocervical trunk. The proximal left subclavian artery stent
was patent, with a 20 mnHg gradient in the subclavian distal to
the LIMA origin. The LIMA had a mild kinking mid graft and a
mild anastomotic lesion; there was retrograde filling of a large
diagonal and aterograde filling of the apical LAD with
collaterals to the RCA. There was a 50% lesion at the origin of
the vertebral artery.
  3. Abdominal aortography using an angled pigtail catheter just
below the level of the renal arteries revealed no apparent renal
artery stenosis. There was extensive distal abdominal aortic
disease with plaque at the origin of the right iliac artery and
a 60-70% stenosis at the origin of the left iliac artery. There
was calcific atherosclerosis in both femoral arteries. The right
femoral artery had been noted to be heavily calcified during
arterial access.
  4. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic blood
pressure with SBP of 101 mmHg, elevated right and left sided
filling pressures with RVEDP of 13 mmHg and mean PCWP of 22
mmHg. There was pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP of 45
mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.7 l/min/m2 (using an
assumed oxygen consumption).

Echocardiogram [**2181-10-17**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with akinesis to dyskinesis of
thinned inferior and infero-lateral walls. The basal septum
moves best and the remaining segments are hypokinetic. There is
no ventricular septal defect. with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mil
