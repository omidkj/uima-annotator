Discharge Instructions:
You are being discharged with the following instructions:
*incentive spirometry every 2-4 hours
*may ambulate with assistance
*regular diet
Please follow-up in the emergency room if you experience the
following instructions:
Your injury caused rib fractures 4-6th which can cause severe
pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because
of the pain.

*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep
breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the
dose and notify your physician.

*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that
pool in the lungs.

*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing
and deep breathing.

*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short
periods may ease the pain.

*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid
and fiber intake if possible.

*  Do NOT smoke

*  If your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin,
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side
effects so make sure your doctor approves.

*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation
around your ribs ( crepitus
