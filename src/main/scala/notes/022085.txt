Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred for emergent repair of ruptured AAA.
For details of this, please see the previously dictated
operative note.
  Post-operatively, the patient was brought to the ICU for
monitoring.  She remained intubated for 10 days secondary to her
open abdomen and volume overload following resuscitation.
Throughout this period, she was maintained on vancomycin,
Levaquin and Flagyl for antibiotic prophylaxis, fearing a graft
infection.  On POD #10, she was brought back to the operating
room for closure of her abdomen.  For details of this, please
see the previously dictated operative note.
  The patient then had a slow wean from mechanical ventilation
and was intermittently diuresed with Lasix prn and Lasix gtt.
She extubated on POD #20 without event.  She did spike fevers
and had a mildly elevated WBC (12 - 13) which prompted an
infectious work-up which revealed an E. coli pneumonia and
urinary tract infection.  She was empirically begun on Zosyn
while culture data was pending, and continued on Zosyn based on
sensitivities.
  Ultimately, the patient was discharged to rehab on PODs #25 &
15 tolerating a regular diet, in adequate pain control, afebrile
and with a normal white count.  She has been working with
physical therapy to regain her strength and motor function.

Neurologic: no issues
Cardiac: Lopressor for rate control and HTN; restart quinapril
Pulmonary: continue with pulmonary toilet; incentive spirometry;
out of bed to chair and ambulation with assistance
GI: passed a swallow evaluation for aspiration risk; tolerating
a cardiac diet and Boost supplementation
GU: Foley in place for continued diuresis;  Lasix 20 mg IV BID
x7 more days
Hematologic: heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis; begin Coumadin 5 mg
QD for chronic atrial fibrillation
ID: Zosyn for 5 more days to complete 14 day course (E. coli
pneumonia and urinary tract infection)
Endo: insulin sliding scale while on tube feeds, can be weaned
off
