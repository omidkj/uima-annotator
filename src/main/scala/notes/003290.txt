Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Infected ICD lead

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD removal and reimplantation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 33 yo male with PMHx of congenital heart defect s/p
ASD repair [**2159**], s/p MV repair [**2174**] and then mechanical MVR
(model number #[**2184-1-18**]),
complicated by complete heart block s/p pacemaker, developed
pacemaker-induced cardiomyopathy, upgraded to biventricular ICD
upgraded in [**2188**], who presents with an infected, eroded, exposed
lead to OSH this AM.
.
He initially noted a small pustule around the [**Year (4 digits) **] pocket 2
weeks ago. At that time, he had no fevers, chills, and denied
pain or drainage from the site. He visited his outpatient
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], 3 days prior to admission, and was
started on Keflex. He presented to OSH ED today after he noticed
that exposed leads after the pustule spontaneously drained. He
denied any recent fever (highest temp 99F on Friday), chills,
sweats, or pain or redness at site. Further denies trauma in the
area.
.
He was noted to be afebrile, HR 75 (paced), BP 129/81, satting
99% on RA. Prior to transfer, the patient was started on 1.25mg
vancomycin q12 and Ancef 1g q8. INR at the OSH was noted to be
3.0, with goal INR 2.5 to 3.5. Labs showed glucose of 136, BUN
of 13, creatinine of 0.69, sodium 139, potassium of 3.9,
chloride of 106, bicarb of 26, WBC of 10.4, hemoglobin of 14.3,
hematocrit of 41.5, platelets of 299,000. CXR showed no
subcutaneous air and pacerleads looked intact. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on the same day for hardware removal and
reimplantation.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was afebrile and comfortable,
VS were 98.2, 117/80, 86, 18, 100% RA. He denies chest pain and
shortness of breath.

Imaging:
CXR ([**2190-4-5**])
COMPARISON: No comparison available at the time of dictation.
FINDINGS: The lung volumes are normal. Moderate cardiomegaly,
status post
valvular replacement. Pacemaker in situ. No acute changes,
notably no
pulmonary edema, no pneumonia. No pleural effusions. The study
and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
.
TTE ([**2190-4-6**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior and posterior
akinesis. The basal inferior and posterior walls are aneurysmal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
At least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. No
valvular or wire-associated vegetation seen.
.
TEE ([**2190-4-8**]):
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or
right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid
anteroseptal wall. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Right ventricular cavity size is normal with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

A mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is present. The motion of
the mitral valve prosthetic leaflets appears normal.
Characteristic washing jets are seen. A mild paravalvular mitral
prosthesis leak is probably present.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
tricuspid valve. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
ICD/pacemaker leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2190-4-16**] CXR
Right ICD leads terminate in the right atrium and ventricle.
Again
seen is a tubular structure overlying the left hemithorax that
is presumably external to the patient. Median sternotomy wires,
and surgical clips are noted. The lungs are clear. There is mild
cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 33yo M w/ PMHx of congenital heart defect, s/p ASD
repair at age 2, MVR, pacemaker induced cariomyopathy, s/p ICD
placement who presents with an infected, eroded, exposed [**Month/Day/Year **]
lead, s/p hardware removal and reimplantation.
.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# [**Name2 (NI) 19721**] lead infection: Upon presentation, the patient was
afebrile with [**Name2 (NI) **] leads exposed in the left upper aspected of
the chest with no surrounding erythema, palpable fluctuance, or
purulence. The patient was started on IV cefepime and vancomycin
under the guidance of infectious disease consult service. Blood
cultures were drawn daily while the infected [**Name2 (NI) **] and generator
were in place. TTE did not show evidence of valvular vegetations
given the concern of wire-associated endocarditis. The patient
was taken to the operating room [**2190-4-7**] for [**Year (4 digits) **] lead
and generator extraction. Blood cultures remained negative.
Cultures of the pocket grew PROPIONIBACTERIUM ACNES. His [**Year (4 digits) **]
pocket was closed by plastic surgery on [**2190-4-13**] without
complication. He then underwent a pacemaker replacement on his
right anterior chest on [**2190-4-14**] with removal of the temporary
pacing device. He is to continue antibiotic thearpy for 10 days
following his new pacemaker placement, with linezolid and
moxifloxacin.
