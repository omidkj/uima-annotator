Date of Birth:   [**2089-11-19**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old man
with a history of peripheral vascular disease who presented
to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital the morning of admission with a
He describes the pain as dull, radiating to the left arm and
was noted to have hyperacute anterior T waves and developing
ST elevation anteriorly.  He was given aspirin, Lopressor and
intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin and transferred to the
[**Hospital1 69**] for catheterization.

occlusion of his left anterior descending coronary artery
proximally with thrombus.  He underwent percutaneous
left anterior descending coronary artery with success.  He
was also found to have a total occlusion of the right
coronary artery with extensive bridging and left-to-right
collaterals.  He had a high left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure.

Post catheterization the patient had an episode of vomiting with
Plavix administration. On transfer to the CCU he had minimal left
chest pain without radiation, which subsequently resolved without
intervention.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Peripheral vascular disease.  He
had an aortobifemoral graft done in [**2132**].  2.
Hypercholesterolemia.  3. No history of diabetes mellitus or
hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is an auto repairman, former smoker who
quit several years ago.  He is currently married and has
children.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per history of present illness.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Zoloft 25
mg p.o. q.d.; aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.; vitamin E, vitamin C,
multivitamin; Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q. 8 hours p.r.n.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His examination on admission showed
him to be afebrile, heart rate 72, blood pressure 97/57,
respiratory rate 12-16, O2 saturation 97% on room air.  In
general he was alert and pleasant in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination showed
anicteric sclerae.  Oropharynx was clear.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation.  Cardiovascular examination was regular rate
and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, possible S4, no jugular venous
distension.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.  Extremities
showed no edema.  Right groin had a pressure dressing clean,
dry and intact.  There were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Arterial blood gases were 7.35 pH, CO2 43,
PO2 84.  Laboratory studies at [**Hospital3 417**] showed a sodium
of 144, potassium 3.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 27, BUN 16,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 156, CK 131, MB 0, troponin 0.11.
White blood cell count 10.2, hematocrit 43.8, INR 0.9.

EKG #1 showed normal sinus rhythm with normal axis, ST
elevations anteriorly with acute T waves consistent with
anterior myocardial infarction, Qs in 3 and aVF consistent
with prior myocardial infarction.

At catheterization the left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure was 40 mmHg.  Left-sided catheterization showed
right coronary artery 100% proximal occlusion with
right-to-right and left-to-right collaterals, left main was
normal.  The proximal left anterior descending coronary
artery had 100% occlusion with thrombus which was treated
with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent
placement with no residual stenosis, TIMI 2 fast flow, D1 with
stent overlap, proximal left circumflex coronary artery with 40%
disease, mid circumflex coronary artery with diffuse disease,
distal circumflex coronary artery with diffuse disease,
obtuse marginal #1 normal, obtuse marginal #2 normal.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 47-year-old male with anterior
ST elevation myocardial infarction, status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement;
Electrocardiograms suggestive of completing infarct despite
intervention.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Cardiovascular - coronaries:  The
patient was revascularized with left anterior descending
coronary artery stent and had no residual stenosis, was
started on Plavix, Integrilin, aspirin, with
electrocardiograms showing evolving anterior myocardial
infarction.

The patient underwent an echocardiogram which showed evidence
of anteroseptal and apical akinesis as well as an
inferolateral hypokinesis.  Left ventricular systolic
function was 25%.  The patient was started on captopril which
was titrated up and changed over to lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o.
q.d. on which the patient is to be discharged home, as well
as a small dose of Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. for diuresis.

Rhythm was monitored on Telemetry which showed several
episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which was
asymptomatic.  This was followed by a signal averaged ECG
which was normal that was done on [**2137-11-21**].

Further EP testing was planned given severe LV dysfunction and
anterior/ inferior MI's, but was deferred given new stent
placement.  The patient will likely benefit from an EP study as
an outpatient in about one month.  This has been set up and
scheduled for the patient with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**].

2. Hematology:  The patient was started on heparin as well as
Coumadin for the possibility of mural thrombus due to
depressed ejection fraction as well as apical akinesis.  The
patient is to be discharged home on Lovenox awaiting a
therapeutic INR of 2.0 and will likely need a six-month
course of Coumadin to prevent apical thrombus.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease status post acute anterior
myocardial infarction.
2. Status post cardiac catheterization with intervention to
left anterior descending coronary artery.
3. Peripheral vascular disease.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Congestive heart failure.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:
Good.  The patient is now tolerating all p.o. medications, is
able to walk around with no shortness of breath or chest pain
and has plans for follow up with cardiac rehabilitation as an
outpatient.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Vitamin C, vitamin E and multivitamin.
6. Ativan 0.5 mg p.o. q. 8 hours p.r.n.
7. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Zoloft 25 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Lovenox 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. subcutaneous until INR is
greater than 2.0.
