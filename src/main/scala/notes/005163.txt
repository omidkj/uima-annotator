Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Cardiac Catheterization (stable CAD, no intervention)


History of Present Illness:
76 year old female with history of CAD status post CABG in [**2145**]
(SVG-LAD/D1), CHF (EF 30%), DM2, [**Hospital 109679**] transferred from [**Hospital1 56809**] for consideration of cardiac cath.  The
patient says that 2 nights prior to admission, while straining
to have a bowel movement she suddenly became short of breath.
She describes associated chest pain over her left precordium
without radiation, as well as bilateral shoulder pain, abdominal
pain, and back pain.  She did have associated dizziness and
diaphoresis, as well as nausea and vomiting.  She was brought to
the hospital that night by her family.

On arrival at Sturdy, she had mild rales, with CXR demonstrating
mild CHF.  EKG demonstrated old LBBB, without new ST/T changes.
Initial troponin was < 0.02, with BNP of 432. She was given an
additional dose of 0.5 mg IV bumetanide and admitted to
telemetry for cycling of cardiac enzymes.  Unfortunately no
documentation is provided for the proceding 36 hours, however
per report from the family, over the course of the following day
she experienced several episodes of shortness of breath
associated with chest pain.  Her troponin rose from < 0.02 to
1.3, with CK and MB remaining within normal limits.  She was
thought to be having episodes of acute pulmonary edema and was
given extra doses of bumetanide.  On the night of [**7-15**], however,
her shortness of breath was severe enough to require ICU
transfer for BIPAP initiation.  She was started on heparin and
integrillin drips at this point secondary to concern for
ischemia, with troponin peaking at 1.5, with normal CKs.  EKGs
were unchanged throughout.  It was eventually decided to
transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization to rule out ischemia.

Of note, about 1 month ago her cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] cut her
bumetanide dose in half secondary to rising creatinine, and her
aldactone was discontinued completely secondary to hyperkalemia.


Also of note, P-MIBI in [**4-17**] revealed a fixed large severe
defect in the LAD territory, as well as a reversible small mild
defect in the PDA territory.  She underwent catheterization in
[**6-17**] which demonstrated an unchanged chronic 90% lesion in the
non-dominant proximal RCA, diffuse disease in the LAD with a
50-60% mid-distal lesion, with likely total occlusion of D2, as
well as diffuse disease in the LCx and LPDL.  No intervention
was performed.


Past Medical History:
1)CAD:
[**2145**]: CATH/PTCA: Patient underwent PTCA which was complicatd by
abrupt closure requiring CABG (SVG->LAD/D1).
[**2154**]: CATH:  Patient presented with recurrent angina and
underwent catherization, which revealed moderate LAD disease, a
60-70% OM stenosis, and a 90% stenosis proximally in a
diminutive non-dominant RCA. She underwent DCA of the OM in
lesion [**2155-7-8**]. Subsequently, patient underwent relook procedure
and found to have patent DCA site.
.
[**4-17**] ECHO:  Patient underwent echo which showed overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderate to severely depressed
(EF 30%). Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
septal, anterior and mid and apical lateral and apical
inferolateral severe hypokinesis to akinesis.
.
[**4-17**] P-MIBI:  IMPRESSION:
1. Fixed, large, severe defect involving the LAD territory.
2. Reversible, small, mild defect involving the PDA territory.
3. Increased left ventricular cavity size. Moderate left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis and
anterior and apical akinesis.
.
[**6-17**] CATH:  Patient admitted to outside hospital for CHF
excaerbation and underwent cardiac catherization. The cath
showed the following results: LMCA demonstrated a 30% mid vessel
stenosis, the LAD showed diffuse disease throughout the vessel
with a mid-distal 50-60% lesion along with a likely total
occlusion of the D2, the LCX showed diffuse plaguing with a 30%
stenosis at two hinge points in the major inferolateral OM, the
LPDA and LPL were small in diameter with diffuse disease, and
the RCA was a very small non-dominant vessel with a chronic 90%
proximal lesion. Resting hemodynamic measurements showed
elevated right and left filling pressures (mean RA 8mm Hg / mean
PCWP 18mm Hg / LVEDP 25mm Hg)and mild pulmonary hypertension
pulmonary artery pressure 48/17.
.
2) CHF:  Last echo [**4-17**] with resting regional wall motion
abnormalities including septal, anterior and mid and apical
lateral and apical inferolateral severe hypokinesis to akinesis,
EF 30%.
3) DM2
4) Hypercholesterolemia
5) Lower extremity DVT x 2, last > 1 year ago
6) Anxiety disorder
7) Cataracts
8) Metastatic breast cancer to ribs, vertebrae, and pelvis.
Treated with modified radical mastectomy with skin graft;
Tamoxifen x 7 yrs; arimidex x 1.5 yrs, then taxotere, now
exemestane since [**1-19**].

[**70**]) Pulmonary nodule

Echo ([**2167-7-17**]):
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include the akinesis of the apical portion of the LV with
anteroseptal and mid inferior wall akinesis
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2166-4-14**], no obvious change in wall motion or overall EF.
However, there is an increase  in the PA pre
