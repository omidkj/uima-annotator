Pertinent Results:
[**2154-8-5**] TEE
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results in the operating room at
the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is atrially paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. Valvular function is unchanged
from pre-bypass. The thoracic aorta is intact after
decannulation
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2154-8-5**] where
the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times two
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well
and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Post operative
day one found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on post operative day four the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 392**]
Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
