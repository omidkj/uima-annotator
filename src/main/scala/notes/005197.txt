Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo m with HTN, morbid obesity, who presents with LLE
cellulitis and sepsis, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to concern for
necrotizing fasciitis.
.
1. Cellulitis: Pt with history of recent fevers (though never
frankly febrile in MICU), who presented with elevated lactate,
low-normal SBP, and elevated Cr thought to be related to
significant lower extremity cellulitis. He was admitted to the
ICU and aggressively fluid resuscitated per sepsis protocol and
his CVP was monitored with goal > 12. Surgery was consulted and
he was initially treated with Vanco/Unasyn/Clinda and scheduled
for MRI to eval the LE. However, his clinical picture improved
and there was low suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis at this
point, so did not get MRI and clindamycin was stopped.  He was
called out to the floor on HD#3 and  transitioned to PO
Augmentin given his negative MRSA swab; he remained afebrile and
stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization.  A PICC which
had been placed on [**3-1**] for access was removed prior to his
discharge to rehab.  His WBC was trending upwards, but then
stabilized.  He should have it rechecked within 1-2 days at
rehab.
.
2) Hypoxia: Mr. [**Known lastname 72536**] hypoxia was of unclear, but likely
multifactorial, etiology. It was thought most likely related to
aggressive volume overload from fluid resuscitation, sepsis, and
decreased respiratory drive from pain meds. He likely has a
component of OSA related to his body habitus although this has
not been evaluated in the past. Mr. [**Known lastname 20932**] was maintained on
supplemental O2 and did not require intubation during his MICU
course.  He was started on albuterol/atrovent nebs and a
nicotine patch and diuresed with Lasix prn until he was
completely weaned from oxygen.  He should likely have an
outpatient sleep study.
.
3) Diabetes Mellitus: Given his new cellulitis and his body
habitus, a HbA1c was sent which was 6.6%.  This was a new
diagnosis and patient was educated and counseled on these new
findings.  He was encouraged to enter a weight loss program
along with dietary and lifestyle modications to control this.  A
urine creat/[**Last Name (un) **] ratio was sent which showed microalbuminuria.
Lisinopril 10mg was started which can be titrated up as an
outpatient.  Aspirin 325 daily was also started during this
admission.  He should be on a sliding scale insulin while at
rehab and should discuss long term management with his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] panel was sent and was pending at time of this discharge
summary.  He was started on simvastatin and should follow up
with his primary care doctor for this.
.
4) HTN: His BPs were initially low but after fluid resuscitation
he returned to his hypertensive baseline.  In addition to his
home regimen of Atenolol, Lisinopril 10 mg daily was started
this admission given his new diagnosis of DM and HTN.  This can
be titrated up as needed during his rehab stay. He was
discharged on metoprolol and lisinopril for ease of titration.
.
5) ARF: He experienced a mild acute renal failure during his
MICU stay which resolved with IVF.
.
6) DISPO: Given his significant obesity, along with LLE pain and
cellulitis along with inability to ambulate, he was transferred
to rehab for further PT/OT.  He is to follow up with his PCP
after discharge.
