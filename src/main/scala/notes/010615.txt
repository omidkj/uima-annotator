History of Present Illness:
64 yo M with Hx of CAD s/p NSTEMI, severe COPD with multiple
intubations on chronic steroids, who was recently admitted
between [**2104-1-17**] and [**2104-1-19**] with COPD exacerbation as well as
asymptomatic bacteruia and pyuria. Despite the positive UA, the
pt was only treated with one dose of ceftriaxone in the ED. The
abx was discontinued on the floor as he had a chronic
in-dwelling foley and he was asymptomatic. He now returns with
fevers, diarhea, and left lower quadrant abdominal pains since
this morning. The pt reports he ate some yellow rice three days
ago. Since then he has had fevers, chills, with abdominal
discomfort similar to gas pain and diaarheea. His stools were
described were as black, loose and watery. He reports having 6
BM/day. On occasion, he has some minimal incontinence with his
gas. Of note, he has also been on iron supplements. In addition,
the pt reports he has had burning with urination intermittently.
He has an indwelling foley catheter for >6 months which he has
changed once/month. The last time the catheter was changed was
in [**Month (only) **]. 20s. He reports he has had dark cloudy urine with white
chuncky matter in his stream intermittently. The dysuria occurs
when the urine flows around the catheter which occurs
occasionally. He started taking ciprofloxacin (unknown dose) at
one tab once daily on his own from prior prescriptions five days
ago with some improvement in his sx. However he is requesting a
foley change.
.
In the ED, the pt was febrile to 100.6, with HR of 94, and BP of
72/37. He was found to have pursed lipped breathing, upper
quadrant pain, and guaiac negative. He was given 5L of NS with
transient improvement in his SBP. Nonetheless, he had a central
line placed and started on IV Abx (Flagyl 500mg, Ceftriaxone 1g,
and Ceftazidime 1g) as well as stress dose steroids
(dexamethasone 10mg). He had an elevated WBC to 17.3 as well as
an elevated lactate to 3.6 (which decreased to 0.9 after fluid
resuscitation) and a positive UA. In addition, he developed
chest pain at [**2098**] at which time he was also given [**Year (4 digits) **] 325mg x1,
morphine 2mg x1. His BP decreased after the morphine and he was
started on levophed. In addition, he received calcium 1g x1, and
albuterol x3 and iprotroprium 3 through his ED stay. The pt was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for presumed sepsis.

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
ECG [**2104-1-27**]: poor baseline, NSR at 90, Nml axis, Nml intervals,
RSR' in V1, V2, V3, 0.5mm ST elevation in v3 only.
.
CXR [**2104-1-27**]: COPD. Linear atelectasis at the right lung base. No
focal pneumonia or CHF.
.
Abd CT [**2104-1-27**]:
"1. Emphysema.
2. Chronic bibasilar opacities, probably scarring.
3. Likely left renal cyst. However, an ultrasound would be
helpful for further characterization to exclude a mass.
4. Small calcific densities, which most likely are layering in
the bladder. However, this could be determined more definitively
with a bladder ultrasound examination to assess for bladder
stones.
5. Diverticulosis throughout the [**Month/Day/Year 499**].
6. Focus of bowel wall thickening in the sigmoid, which may be
artifactual. However, the presence of a mass cannot be excluded
by this study."
.
RENAL U.S.  [**2104-1-30**] 10:56 AM
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of hydronephrosis or kidney stones. Limited
evaluation of the bladder secondary to decompression with Foley
catheter. Multiple smalool sub- centimeter echogenic foci with a
long thickened bladder wall. Difficult to assess whether these
lesions are intraluminal or intramural. If there is further
clinical concern, recommend reexamining with full bladder
without Foley catheter.
