Date of Birth:   [**2069-2-27**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Company 191**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year old
female with a complicated past medical history, admitted on
[**2115-8-28**] for a chief complaint of stridor.  She
presented with a three day history of shortness of breath,
noisy breathing, upper respiratory infection symptoms and
odynophagia.  On a recent hospital, between [**2115-4-26**] and
[**2115-6-28**], the patient was intubated for aspiration
pneumonia which led to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The patient subsequently underwent tracheostomy on [**2115-5-25**] and decannulated seven weeks prior to this admission.

The patient has a history of bilateral vocal cord paralysis
of unknown etiology.  In the Emergency Room, the patient was
given steroids, racemic epinephrine and ceftriaxone times
one, with minimal improvement.  She was taken to the
Operating Room for an emergent tracheostomy and transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation.

The patient's current issues include:
1.  Infectious disease:  On Unasyn for upper respiratory
infection/tracheobronchitis.
2.  Coronary artery disease:  Ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.
3.  Congestive heart failure:  Pulmonary edema on chest
x-ray, being diuresed with intravenous Lasix.
4.  Hypertension:  Blood pressure elevated post procedure.
5.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient has
hyperkalemia.

Upon transfer to the floor, the patient is complaining of
mild head congestion, also complaining of double vision which
resolves when she covers one eye, either right or left.  Her
diplopia started in [**Month (only) 205**] and has been worse over the past few
days.  The patient is complaining of increased secretions
from her tracheostomy.  The patient thinks it might be food
that she is aspirating.  The patient denies shortness of
breath or chest pain.

history of lupus nephritis, vasculitis and cerebritis,
diagnosed at age 27.  2.  Hepatitis B.  3.  Hypertension.  4.
Peptic ulcer disease.  5.  Gout.  6.  Transient ischemic
attacks in [**2104**].  7.  Congestive heart failure.  8.  Chronic
renal insufficiency, previously on hemodialysis but not
currently.  9.  History of recurrent urinary tract
infections.  10.  History of liver mass, found to be benign
on liver biopsy in [**2114-7-10**].  11.  History of alcohol
abuse.  12.  Status post L5-S1 and S2 diskectomies in [**2110**].
13.  History of pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  14.
History of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.  15.  History
of Clostridium difficile colitis.  16.  Depression.  17.
Splenectomy status post motor vehicle accident.  18.
Dysphagia with past history of tube feeds.  19.
Echocardiogram in [**2115-5-10**] showed dilated right atrium,
mildly dilated left atrium, systolic function with left
ventricular ejection fraction of 75%, right ventricular
hypertrophy, bicuspid aortic valve, 2+ aortic regurgitation,
2+ mitral regurgitation, decreased right ventricular systolic
function.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prednisone 5 mg p.o.q.d., Prilosec
20 mg p.o.q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d., Zoloft 100 mg p.o.q.d.,
Norvasc 10 mg p.o.q.d., Serax 15 mg p.o.q.h.s.p.r.n.; upon
transfer, Zofran 2 to 4 mg i.v.q.8h.p.r.n., Protonix 40 mg
p.o.q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d., regular insulin sliding
scale, Unasyn 1.5 mg i.v.q.6h., thiamine 100 mg p.o.q.d.,
folate 1 mg p.o.q.d., Prednisone 5 mg p.o.q.d., Zoloft 100 mg
p.o.q.d., Norvasc 10 mg p.o.q.d., Serax 10 mg
p.o.q.h.s.p.r.n., Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg p.o.q.6h.p.r.n.,
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes one pack per day and has
a prior history of alcohol abuse.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray showed stable cardiomegaly with
increased congestive heart failure and increased left
effusion; ill-defined lucency along the left upper
mediastinum, possibly representing air in distended
esophagus, however, mediastinal air collection could not be
ruled out; recommend follow-up study.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a temperature of 98.7, pulse 80, respiratory rate 22,
blood pressure 157/93, and oxygen saturation 100% in room
air.  General:  Patient alert, in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Extraocular movements intact,
diplopia with downward gaze.  Neck:  Tracheostomy in place.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic
ejection murmur at left upper sternal border.  Lungs:
Minimal rales at bases.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No edema.
Neurologic examination:  Cranial nerves II through XII
intact, no nystagmus, diplopia disappears when either eye is
covered, made worse with downward gaze.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  The tracheostomy remained
in place for the duration of the hospitalization.  A repeat
chest x-ray was negative for air leak in mediastinum.  The
patient is to follow up with otolaryngology upon discharge.
She is to continue Prednisone 5 mg daily.

2.  Infectious disease/tracheobronchitis:  Once an air leak
in the mediastinum was ruled out, intravenous Unasyn was
discontinued.  Since the tracheobronchitis was likely viral,
antibiotics were not continued.

3.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient's congestive heart
failure stabilized after diuresis with intravenous Lasix.
The patient was continued on her home dose of oral Lasix.

4.  Hypertension:  The patient was restarted on her home
medications of Norvasc, atenolol and lisinopril.  The
lisinopril was titrated upward to a dose of 30 mg daily.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  An initial swallow study revealed mild
aspiration with all consistencies.  The patient was allowed
to continue taking orals and her diet was advanced as
tolerated.  No repeat swallow study was done.

6.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient's
potassium returned to [**Location 213**] after one dose of Kayexalate.

7.  Neurology:  A neurology consult was obtained to evaluate
the patient's diplopia.  Neurology felt that she had partial
cranial nerve palsy secondary to past multiple strokes.  They
did not feel that [**Last Name **] problem was acute and recommended
follow-up in clinic as an outpatient.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.
