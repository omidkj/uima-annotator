Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
presenting for elective surgery

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy
endotracheal intubation
central venous catheter placement
arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60 year old female, with no significant past
medical history, recently referred to gynecology-oncology for a
diagnosis of ovarian cancer. She initially presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital with a complaint of progressive shortness of breath.
She also reported a 20-30 pound weight loss, gradual abdominal
distention and bilateral lower extremity swelling.  She was
found to have a large right pleural effusion and underwent a 2.5
L thoracentesis, with negative cytology. The patient also had a
paracentesis with negative cytology at the OSH. CT torso on [**10-20**]
showed bilateral pulmonary opacities, diffuse lymphadenopathy,
ascities, and ovarian masses.  Ultrasound on [**2107-10-21**] showed
bilateral pelvic soft tissue masses with ascites and normal
uterus. CA-125 was elevated at greater than 2500. She was then
transferred to the gyn-onc service for further management.
.
Patient underwent TAH/BSO, and ascites drainage.  Right pelvic
lymph node was sent for frozen section which was found to be
consistent with lymphoma.  The right ovarian mass was found to
be benign.  Multiple enlarged lymph noes were found, the largest
was over 5 cm.  Intraoperatively, she received 1 L IVF and was
bolused subsequently for low UOP and for post-operative
hypotension.     Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing
treatment.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was intubated and mildly
sedated, VS: BP 84/52 MAP 65 HR 88 O2 sat 95% on AC. Central
line was placed under ultrasound guidance in the right IJ.
While in the ICU, she was put on up to 3 pressors for her
hypotension.  She went into acute renal failure (thought to be
from hypotension-related ATN with a possible component of tumor
lysis syndrome from steroid-induced lysis) requiring CVVH and
rasburicase.  She was successfully taken off CVVH and extubated.
 She was diuresed aggressively for a 20L net positive fluid
status since her ICU admission.  Her abdominal wound was
draining up to 1L/day.  Also while in the ICU, she was noted to
have an EF of 20%,; it is unclear if this is from an MI in the
setting of hypotension or if it is just "shocked" myocardium.
.
After her acute issues stabilized, the patient was transferred
to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] for further management.


Past Medical History:
none

Social History:
The patient smoked one pack per day for 30 years, but currently
does not smoke. She drinks occasionally. She is married and has
two daughters and one son from a previous marraige.

stimuli

Pulm: CTA anteriorly
Abd: midline abdominal dressing clean and intact. obese,
nontender, hypoactive bowel sounds.
Ext: warm, trace edema, no cyanosis. pedal pulses present
neuro: not responsive to voice or noxious stimuli [**3-3**] sedation.

CT scan [**2107-11-4**] for lymphoma staging:
There is mildly heterogeneous and enlarged thyroid gland with a
small 1-cm hypodense nodule within the right lobe. There are
multiple nodes present within the mediastinum, the largest of
which is seen within the paraesophageal space measuring 16 mm in
diameter. There are bilateral enlarged hilar lymph nodes which
cannot be definitely measured given lack of IV contrast. There
is marked axillary lymphadenopathy with a representative node on
the right measuring 20 x 18 mm and is seen on series 2, image 6.
A representative node within the left axilla is seen on series
2, image 8, measuring 16 x 12 mm. There are multiple tiny
nodules seen within the breasts bilaterally, the largest on the
left hand side measuring 12 x 15 mm, seen on series 2, image 16.
There are bilateral large pleural effusions. The lungs are
otherwise clear. Along the right thorax just below the scapula,
there is a moderate amount of air within the subcutaneous and
intramuscular space, probably sequelae from prior thoracentesis.
The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. There is a 27 x 15
mm node along the right pericardium measuring 15 x 27 mm, seen
on series 2, image 36. The patient is intubated and has a
nasogastric tube extending with tip in the post-pyloric region.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a moderate amount of
ascites. The liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder wall is
thickened likely secondary to third spacing. The pancreas is not
clearly defined but appears grossly unremarkable. The spleen is
prominent, slightly displacing the stomach medially 12 x 7 cm.
The adrenal glands are not well visualized secondary to an
extensive amount of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy extending
from the level of the SMA inferiorly and encasing the aorta and
IVC. A representative size of this conglomeration is seen on
series 2, image 74 measuring 86 x 52 mm. There is extensive
lymphadenopathy within the mesentery with a conglomerate of
nodes measuring 57 x 40 mm, seen on series 2, image 85. There is
a moderate amount of ascites. The small and large bowel are
unremarkable and opacified with oral contrast extending to the
rectum. There is no evidence of obstruction.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is catheterized.
The rectum is unremarkable. The uterus is not well visualized.
There are no adnexal masses with the exception of extensive
lymphadenopathy that extends into the deep pelvis bilaterally
inferiorly from the above-mentioned retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy along the iliac nodal chains. The largest bulk
of this lymphadenopathy measures 94 x 47 mm along the left iliac
nodal chain seen on series 2, image 105. There is extensive
inguinal lymphadenopathy, the largest nodal conglomerate seen on
the left measuring 49 x 62 mm.

Also noted within the subcutaneous tissue in the midline of the
abdomen are a few pockets of air seen along a linear soft tissue
defect likely secondary to prior surgical intervention.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
.
Echo ([**2107-11-2**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the
ventricle. Basal
segments contract well. The apex is milldy aneurysmal and
akinetic, but no
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle, though the
apex is
trabeculated. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is
focal
akinesis of the apical half of the RV free wall. The aortic
valve leaflets
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
