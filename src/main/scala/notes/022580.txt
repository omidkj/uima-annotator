HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87 year old man with
severe peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure
and cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes,
history of upper gastrointestinal bleed and lower extremity
wound who was recently discharged from [**Hospital6 649**] at the end of [**Month (only) 359**] for Clostridium
difficile colitis and upper gastrointestinal bleed who now
presents with acute and chronic renal failure, hyperkalemia,
worsening lower extremity pain and persistent diarrhea from
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.  In the Emergency Department, he was
hemodynamically stable.  His lower extremity ulcers had a pus
exudate.  He had a urinalysis consistent with urinary tract
infection with thick milky colored urine and was found to
have diarrhea.  He also had a potassium of 7.3.  He was given
D50 plus insulin plus Kayexalate, plus calcium carbonate and
Zosyn times one dose.

Additional history reveals his last admission from [**10-6**]
through [**10-11**], he was positive for Clostridium difficile
on [**10-6**] and had bloody stools, was given intravenous
Levofloxacin and Flagyl and p.o. Vancomycin.  He also
underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**10-7**], which
showed the lower one-third of his esophagus had ulcers plus
duodenitis.  He was sent out on p.o. Vancomycin.  After
speaking with his daughter the patient has had bloody stools
at [**Hospital1 **], has been receiving increasing doses of Lasix via
phone conversations with primary care doctors.  He has a
history of having a colonoscopy in [**2173-4-22**], positive for
only a small benign appearing polyp and reports no fevers,
weight loss, nausea, vomiting, chest pain or shortness of
breath.  He is not on home oxygen but is requiring oxygen
upon interviewing.  No belly pain.  He does have pain in his
lower extremities bilaterally with his wounds.  He is not
very ambulatory at [**Hospital1 **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Peripheral vascular disease,
status post left superficial femoral artery stent; 2.
Congestive heart failure in idiopathic cardiomyopathy with 20
to 30%; 3.  History of Clostridium difficile at the end of
[**2173-9-22**] treated for 30 days with p.o. Vancomycin; 4.
History of upper gastrointestinal bleed; 5.  Chronic atrial
fibrillation; 6.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline
creatinine of 2.0; 7.  Diabetes Type 2, diet-controlled; 8.
Hypertension; 9.  Hyperlipidemia.

ALLERGIES:  Darvocet and Percocet and essentially all
narcotics as they cause altered mental status.

MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient Medications include Lipitor 10 mg a
day, Nephrocaps, Plavix 75 mg a day, Allopurinol, Questran,
Digoxin 0.125 three times a week, Flomax, Coumadin,
Rocaltrol, Lopressor 12.5, Aspirin 325, Epogen.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a retired dentist, no smoking, alcohol
or drug history.  His daughter is intensely involved with his
medical care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination he weighed 85 kg,
temperature 95.3, temperature maximum 97.6, heartrate in the
60s to 70s and atrial fibrillation, blood pressure 113/135/50
to 60s, sating anywhere from 95 to 99% on 2 liters of nasal
cannula, guaiac positive stool.  Generally he has a flat,
depressed affect.  Neck:  No jugulovenous pressure was
appreciated, no nodules or lymphadenopathy.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Clear oropharynx, moist mucous
membranes, pale conjunctiva, anicteric sclera, small pupils
bilaterally but reactive.  Extraocular movements intact.
Chest examination, decreased breathsounds with bibasilar
crackles bilaterally.  Cardiovascular, irregular rhythm with
a holosystolic II/VI murmur.  Abdomen was soft, positive
bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities, erythema
to below the knees with a temperature gradient compared to
the thighs, bandages, foul odor coming from the siege, no
edema.  Underneath the bandages find exposed bone and tendon.
Neurological examination, cranial nerves II through XII
appear intact, gross upper extremity strength 5/5 unable to
test lower extremity strength secondary to his chronic ulcers
and pain.  Sensation to light touch intact grossly
throughout.  Gait not tested.  The patient is not ambulatory
with multiple ulcers on bilateral lower extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data reveals he was
admitted with a white count of 24,000 at maximum which
subsequently dwindled to 8.4 upon discharge.  His hematocrit
was metered at 26.0, however, was stable ranging from 30 to
32 upon discharge, platelets stable.  Coagulation profile, he
was admitted with an INR of 2.0, held Coumadin secondary to
gastrointestinal bleeding and INR fell to within the normal
range.  Chem-7, the potassium was 7.3 upon admission and upon
discharge is within normal range.  Sodium initially high at
146 and now within normal limits, BUN initially in the 100s,
104, but within normal limits upon discharge, creatinine
maximum value was 8.6, down to the range of 4 upon discharge.
Calcium, magnesium and phosphorus were followed and were
abnormal.  His urinalysis showed more than 50 white blood
cells, moderate leukocyte esterase and liver function test
were within normal limits.  Digoxin level was 1.0.  Urine
sodium 58, creatinine 58.  Culture data, stool negative for
Clostridium difficile on [**11-29**], [**11-19**], [**11-18**]
and stool culture from [**11-17**] was positive for gram
negative rods, this was sent to the state laboratory for
further identification and it is not back yet upon discharge.
No Campylobacter, negative for Clostridium difficile.
Culture data from the urine grew out yeast, otherwise
negative.  Culture data from blood showed no growth on
[**11-19**], no fungus or mycobacterium, no growth from
[**11-19**], again and one bottle with Corynebacterium
diphtheroids 1 out of 2 from [**11-17**].  Swab cultures
taken from wounds grew out Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus
aureus coagulase positive, sensitive to Vancomycin and a
Pseudomonas sensitive to Zosyn, multiple cultures were taken.

Studies, renal ultrasound consistent with chronic renal
failure.  Chest x-ray, cardiomegaly, left atelectasis and
effusion, pulmonary edema.  He had a stress MIBI in [**2171-9-23**], moderate reversible inferior wall defects, no
electrocardiogram changes or symptoms.  Ejection fraction was
approximately 30%, diffuse hypokinesis.  On [**2173-9-21**], he had a catheterization that showed critical stenosis
of the right superficial femoral artery even after stenting.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Renal failure - Originally it was
suspected that this was a prerenal etiology as the patient
had increased diarrhea and had increasing diuretic regimen
while at [**Hospital1 **].  The patient became anuric.  Other causes
of renal failure were investigated including SPEP and UPEP,
which SPEP was consistent with inflammatory response, UPEP
showed no light change.  Hepatitic panel was negative with
the exception of the hepatitis B surface antibody, not
indicating disease, indicating immunity.  The FENA,
fractional excretion of sodium was 4.6%, urine eosinophils
were positive moderately, renal ultrasound was normal.  Renal
Service was consulted and it was decided secondary to the
patient's volume overload and the persistent hyperkalemia
that this patient undergo hemodialysis, thus a right internal
jugular Quinton catheter was placed on [**11-23**] for
hemodialysis and the patient received three episodes of
hemodialysis in a row and then was converted to three times
per week schedule, Saturday, Tuesday and Thursday.  There was
a plan for vascular surgeon, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to evaluate the
patient for arteriovenous fistula and graft. Vein mapping was
done on [**11-25**].  A tunneled catheter and PICC line were
placed by Interventional Radiology on [**10-30**].  This
patient was maintained on Calcium Acetate and Nephrocaps and
Epogen and Calcitriol are given at hemodialysis.  The patient
has urinary tract infection and was treated with Zosyn
renally.  Zosyn was also used to treat the wound cultures as
well.  This patient also ha
