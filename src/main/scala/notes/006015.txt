Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status; transferred to MICU for Hypertensive
Urgency, Hypoglycemia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81454**] is a 72 year old male with a recent history of
pericardial effusion (s/p pericardiocentesis ~2 weeks ago) as
well as HTN, HLD, and T2DM (on insulin) who was brought in by
EMS for altered mental status. His blood sugars were noted to be
in the 20s and he was given D50 by EMS. He is not currently able
to provide any significant history of the preceeding events.
However the patient's daughter reports that he has been in his
usual state of health. No recent fevers or other illness.  No
sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] took all of his regular medications including
his 70/30 NPH dose today and there were no recent changes to his
insulin regimen. He has been eating multiple regular meals as he
does usually. Of note, the daughter does report frequent
hypoglycemic episodes for which she has to give him [**Location (un) 2452**]
juice.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  HR 55 182/70 11 98% on RA. Glucose
on arrival was 38. His glucose subsequently improved to 140 with
additional D50. He was also given insulin and his last glucose
prior to transfer was 77. He had a Chest X-ray which showed
cardiomegaly and evidence of fluid overload. Given his recent
pericardiocentesis, a bedside ultrasound was performed which
reportedly did not show any large pericardial effusion. He was
therefore given 20mg of IV lasix. Despite improvement in blood
sugars, the patient was still somnolent although oriented X 3.
He had a head CT which was negative. The patient's blood
pressures were persistently elevated in the ED and therefore he
was started on a nitro drip. He was also given kayexalate for a
potassium of 6.5 which was 5.9 on recheck. No EKG changes were
noted.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's initial VS were 98.5 169/111
81 15 99% on 2L NC. He was resting comfortably in bed without
respiratory distress. He answered orientation questions
correctly but was sleepy. His daughter felt that his mental
status is at baseline, and that this is normal for him given
that it is the middle of the night. He denied chest pain or SOB.
Sleeps with 2 pillows. No PND.
.

Social History:
He is originally from [**Country 16160**] and moved to [**Location (un) 86**] in [**2092**]. He
was living here by himself and working to send money back to his
family who remained in [**Country 480**]. 1 year ago his daughter moved
here from [**Country 16160**] to help take care of him. He lives with just
his daughter; his wife and the rest of his family are still in
[**Country 16160**]. He is not currently working, but he previously worked
as a tractor operator.
Ambulates with a cane. No recent falls.
Tobacco: Stopped smoking approximately 11 years ago
EtOH: none
Illicits: none

Family History:
DMII, remainder unknown.

Physical Exam:

HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL
Neck: [**Country **], JVP difficult to assess because of body habitus

   ACID FAST SMEAR (Pending):

   ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending):

.
[**2108-6-6**] CXR AP:  Again seen, is severe cardiomegaly. The central
pulmonary vessels are engorged, and there is superimposed mild
interstitial edema which is new since the prior study. There is
no pneumothorax. A trace
right pleural effusion is present.
IMPRESSION: Central pulmonary vascular congestion with new
interstitial edema and stable cardiomegaly.
.
[**2108-6-6**] CT head without contrast:  Two attempts were made at
imaging due to patient motion. There is no evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large
vascular territorial infarction. The ventricles and sulci are
mildly prominent, reflective of mild diffuse cortical atrophy.
There is no shift of normally midline structures. There is
under-pneumatization of the mastoid air cells, worse on the
right. The left middle ear cavity appears clear. There is some
opacification within the right middle ear cavity (2:8), which
may be congenital. Included views of paranasal sinuses are
clear. There is mild soft tissue swelling overlying the left
calvarium.
.
[**2108-6-7**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is a mild resting left
ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal
septal motion suggestive of pericardial constriction (septal
flattening with respiration, best seen on clips 25, 58, 29). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. Increased velocities
across pulmonic valve, suggestive of mild pulmonary stenosis.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal (when
taking into account increased gradient across PV).There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. The echo findings are
suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.
.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal septal motion with respiration, suggestive
of pericardial constriction (also seen on TTE from [**2108-5-18**]).
Clinical correlation advised. Mild LVH with preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Resting LVOT gradient.
Increased velocities across pulmonic valve, suggestive of
pulmonary stenosis.
.
Unable to fully compare current findings with study from [**2108-5-18**]
due to focused/limited images on prior study. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1726**] was
notified by telephone today ([**2108-6-7**]) at 12:45 p.m.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81454**] is a 72 year old male with a recent history of
pericardial effusion (s/p pericardiocentesis ~2 weeks ago) as
well as HTN, HLD, and T2DM (on insulin) who was brought in by
EMS for altered mental status and hypoglycemia, also found to
have hypertensive urgency.
.
#) Hypoglycemia: Unclear precipitating factor. According to
patient and daughter he takes his insulin as directed. He is
eating regular meals. Given that his daughter reports multiple
hypoglyemic episodes, his insulin needs may have gone down. This
could relate to his kidney disease because of decreased
clearance of insulin and a
