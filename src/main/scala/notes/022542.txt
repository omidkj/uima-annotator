Brief Hospital Course:
EKG: Sinus rate at 100, ventricular escape at 40, RBBB morph
.
[**8-22**] CXR:  There is severe cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal and hilar
contours are otherwise unremarkable.  There is pulmonary
vascular congestion but no overt CHF.  The lungs are clear.  No
definite pleural effusions are identified, however, the
costophrenic angles are not included on the exam.  There is
thoracic dextroscoliosis.  Osseous and soft tissue structures
are otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  Severe cardiomegaly.  Pulmonary vascular congestion
but no overt CHF.

TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection
fraction 40
percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and
inferior free
wall. Atrioventricular (heart block) and intraventricular
dysynchrony (left
bundle branch block) are likely also to be contributing to the
reduction of
ejection fraction. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The
ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot
be determined.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left
ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. Transmitral Doppler
and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) left
ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

A/P)86 yo M admitted with new complete heart block.
.
1. CV: Rhythm: Complete heart block on EKG, no previous history
of same.  Temporary pacer wire placed in ED; Permanent pacer
placed without incident.  Follow up CXR demonstrated that leads
were in place.  Treated with Ancef prophylactically for 72
hours.  Started on Metoprolol 50 mg PO BID for short run of NSVT
(and BP).
Patient will follow up with device clinic on [**9-7**] and with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**1-25**] weeks.
.
Ischemia: No h/o MI, however per PCP note, history of failed ETT
(?pt does not recall).  Started on ASA 81mg PO qD - (will
monitor closely given h/o GIB) and  Metoprolol as above.  He
will have an ETT - MIBI this week as an outpatient to eval for
further interventions.
.
Pump: Echo with EF 40% with inferoseptal/free wall hypokinesis
confounded by heart block.  Mild AR/MR, mild diastolic
dysfunction.  Pacer placed. Will have ETT-MIBI this week as an
outpatient.
.
2. ARF: Cr of [**12-28**] on admission.  Most likley due to prerenal
etiology [**1-24**] low flow state with decline in CO in 2 days PTA due
to complete heart block.  Resolved with IVF/pacer insertion.
.
3. Anemia: previous Hct in [**4-26**] was 35.9, Hct was stable
throughout his admission at ~31.  His stool was Guiac negative
throughout his admission.
.
4. Depression: Continue outpatient regimen. No acute issues.
.
5. BPH: Continue prazosin and flomax.  No active issues.
.
6. FEN: Heart healthy diet. Electrolytes were monitored and
repleted as needed.
.
