Admission Date:  [**2114-7-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2114-7-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2061-7-26**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for hypertension
who had recently experienced a large loss in weight that was
intentional, approximately 70 pounds, over the past six to
eight months.  As per the wife, the patient had been jogging
on the day of admission about four miles.  He came home and
started doing push-ups and also complained of left arm pain.
A short while later the wife heard a loud thump.  She walked
into the room to find the patient lying on the floor
unconscious.  She activated EMS who arrived within six to ten
minutes and began CPR.  He was found to be in ventricular
tachycardia.  He was shocked out of that rhythm and
intubated.  He was taken to an outside hospital, noted to be
unresponsive and to have decerebrate posture.  His EKG at
that outside hospital was found to have ST elevations on EKG
in leads 2, 3 and aVF.  He was given aspirin, heparin,
Lopressor, Aggrastat, intravenous amiodarone and he was
transferred here to the [**Hospital1 69**]
for a catheterization procedure.  In the Catheterization
Laboratory the patient's left main, left anterior descending
and left circumflex arteries were all found to be normal.
His right coronary artery had a very distal 90% narrowing.
His right heart cath also revealed a CVP of 10, pulmonary
artery pressure of 28/13 and a wedge pressure of 13.  His
cardiac output was 7.56 and his cardiac index was 3.98. The
patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Coronary Care Unit on physical
examination he was found to be lying in bed unresponsive.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Patient had no
jugular venous distention.  His lungs were clear.  His heart
had a regular rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops were
appreciated.  His abdomen was benign.  The extremities were
warm.  He had good pulses.  On neuro examination, he was
found to withdraw to painful stimuli.  He had some extensor
posturing and his toes were downgoing.

LABORATORY VALUES:  Significant for a white count of 18 and a
potassium of 3.1.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Demonstrated only a normal sinus rhythm
at 70 beats per minute.

RADIOLOGY:  His chest x-ray did reveal any signs of
congestive heart failure and no infiltrates.  He had a CT of
his head that showed no evidence of a bleed.  He had a CT of
the neck that showed no evidence of a fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Vital signs on the morning after admission:
He was afebrile with a temperature of 98.6.  His heart rate
ranged from 52 to 103.  His blood pressure systolic ranged
from 115 to 212 and diastolic 91 to 151.  His respirations
ranged from 14 to 22.  He was satting 97% on a vent.  The
patient was started on labetalol drip for tight blood
pressure control.  Neurology was consulted because of
continued decerebrate posturing.  His loss of arousability
was thought to be due to anoxic brain injury from his cardiac
arrest.  He was started on Dilantin for a few days in case
his posturing was due to seizures.  An EEG revealed
generalized slowing but no epileptiform activity.  He slowly
improved as per subsequent Neurology notes and he was
extubated on [**7-20**].  An MRI was ordered because of a
right-sided facial droop and weakness that revealed an
increased signal in the left thalamus internal capsule which
may be artifact.  Some other medical issues:  He was started
on levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia
on hospital day two given some fever and cough.  Because the
etiology for his ventricular tachycardia arrest was not
entirely clear, an ICD was placed on [**2114-7-23**].  He also
had coffee ground emesis on admission which resolved with
proton pump inhibitor therapy.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acute myocardial infarction.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Heparin 5000 units subcu q. 8h.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. 24h.
5.  Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to be transferred to an
acute rehab facility.  Patient should follow up with a
cardiologist within one week.  The name of the rehab facility
is [**Hospital3 245**].
