History of Present Illness:
35 y.o. woman with history of newly diagnosed T cell lymphoma
([**2148-7-4**]) who presented on day 10 status post CHOP.  She had been
feeling well during the week prior to admission before having a
temperature of 100.4 on [**8-2**].  At that point she felt tired but
otherwise well without localizing symptoms (shortness of breath,
cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria, etc...).  She awoke
[**8-3**] with a temperature of 102 F with chills as well as dizziness
and "eyes burning."  Otherwise she reported constipation
(ongoing) and some mouth sores.  These complaints brought her in
to the ED.
.
In the ED temp 102.7, HR 124, BP 98/52, RR 20, O2 Sat 100% RA.
She received Cefepime 2gm IV, vanco 1gm IV, decadron 10mg IV,
and tylenol.  She also received 6L IVF.  In the ED her lowest
SBP was 86 and after fluid HR improved to 100.
.
On arrival to the floor she reported feeling thirsty as well as
mild abdominal cramping and some mild headache.  She denied
photophobia, neck stiffness, SOB, CP, diarrhea.  She had just
finished steroid taper and had been on levofloxacin for
suppressive therapy.

Past Medical History:
Peripheral T cell lymphoma: She presented with fevers and
elevated LFT's in the spring of [**2148**].  Bone marrow biopsy at
that time revealed T-cells.  Treatments so far include
-high dose steroids [**7-12**]
-Nitrogen Mustard [**7-19**]
-CHOP [**7-25**].

Social History:
She lives with her husband who is her health care power of
attorney and her two and a half year old son.  She denies using
tobacco or alcohol.  She rents space in a salon where she does
manicures.

Family History:
Father has a history of benign adrenal mass and skin cancers
removed.  Her mother has hyperparathyroidism and hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 35 yo woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma
admitted for neutropenic fevers and hypotension between her
first and second cycle of CHOP.
.
1. T cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Despite fever patient was able
to proceed to her second cycle of CHOP as scheduled on [**2148-8-13**]
during this admission. She tolerated it well. Because of bone
marrow infarcts during her last cycle G-CSF was held and her
counts dropped. She later was treated with G-CSF and her counts
improved. However, her fevers returned and all her cultures were
negative. Given concern for advancing disease given continued
fevers and no signs of infection she had a series of LP's.   The
second and third LP showed atypical cells that likely
represented CNS disease. Therefore she was started on [**Hospital1 **] and
IT methotrexate with high dose methotrexate on day 10.  She
tolerated these therapies well with only some GI toxicity and
mild mucositis after the methotrexate.  After receiving high
dose methotrexate she again began to have fevers and chills
leading to another infectious work-up which was negative except
for an enterococcal bacteremia (see below).  She also had
slightly elevated liver enzymes so repeat MRI of the abdomen was
obtained and showed no focal involvement of the liver.   She
ended up on broad spectrum antimicrobials for fevers as her
neutropenia reached its nadir.  At the same time work up of her
right radial nerve palsy (see below) led to suspicion of
progressive neurologic disease despite previous chemotherapy.
Thus as she began to recover from her nadir with the help of
G-CSF the plan was made to start steroid therapy for her
suspected continued neurologic disease and proceed to IT AraC
and ESHAP.  The patient defervesced on steroid therapy and the
plan was made to continue to IT Ara C in a few days and ESHAP in
approximately a week of discharge.
.
2.) Fever: On presentation there were no localizing symptoms on
imaging or testing so her fevers were thought to be
non-infectious and probably due to bone marrow infarcts vs drug
fever vs continued disease activity.  Thus she proceeded onto
her second cycle of CHOP.  After the fevers did not resolve
after her second cycle of CHOP an additional fever work up was
initiated which revealed likely CNS involvement of her
lymphoma(see above). Her brain MR was negative for focal
findings but additional work up with lumbar punctures revealed
CNS disease and required additional treatment with [**Hospital1 **] and
intrathecal methotrexate on day 1 and high dose methotrexate on
day 10.  After high dose methotrexate she again became febrile
and thus yet another infectious work up was initiated.  This
revealed an enterococcal urinary tract infection for which she
was treated with vancomycin and then ampicillin after
sensitivities returned.  She never defervesced and as she became
more neutropenic her coverage was broadened to include broad
spectrum antibiotics as well as fungal coverage.  Despite this
coverage she continued to be febrile.  As her cytopenias
resolved and a high suspicion of progressive neurologic lymphoma
arose her antimicrobials were eventually decreased to
levofloxacin and voriconazole, which she continued on discharge.
 At this point progressive lymphoma was considered the most
likely etiology of her fevers but she was continued on
antimicrobials given the inability to completely rule out
infection.  Her fevers only resolved with the initiation of
steroid therapy two days before discharge.
.
3.) Hypotension:  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on presentation
with hypotension as well as fever. She was treated empirically
on admission with vancomycin and cefepime IV and remained
hemodynamically stable overnight. Her blood pressure responded
to fluid bolus of 1L NS. A cortisol stim test was WNL on
[**2148-8-6**]. It is unclear if the hypotension was due to sepsis of
some infecting organism or some other etiology. This did not
recur.
.
4.) Bone marrow infarction: Around day +10 from her first cycle
of CHOP and while on treatment with G-CSF she developed rapidly
rising LDH, severe bony pain, and fever. This was be
