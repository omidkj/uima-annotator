HPI TAKEN ON TRANSFER TO MEDICINE SERVICE RE NON NEUROSURGICAL
ISSUES
Mr [**Known lastname 74588**] is a 64 year old man who is transferred to us from
the neurosurgery service after a long hospital course after a
subarachnoid hemorrhage that came as a massive headache and LOC
while engaged in daily activities. An aneurysm was found to have
burst, and was coiled. Neurologically he has been improving well
post-operatively.
.
In medical terms his course has been somewhat complicated with
hypertension and urinary retention figuring as prominent issues
which remain; post-op ileus and urinary tract infection were
earlier issues. He was considerably fluid-loaded during the
earlier part of his admission. He notes that his abdomen and
pelvis felt swollen and taut, and that his abdomen felt "like a
basketball that was inflated to too high a pressure" likely
secondary to ileus. He feels that this is considerably better
now. He does say that he constantly feels thirsty and that his
mouth feels dry.
.
An echo during his admission showed >55% LVEF with some
diastolic dysfunction. In reviewing his pre-admission history,
Mr [**Known lastname 74588**] [**Last Name (Titles) 74589**] that he has had very little medical care
in the past few years and thus has not had any formal diagnosis
of cardiovascular disease, but also denies any history of
headaches, palpitations, syncope, chest pain, chest tightness,
or notable dyspnea on exertion. He does note that over the last
six months or so he began to notice some swelling in his feet at
the end of his work shift, considerably more than prior.
.
He says that he began noticing some urinary hesitancy and
retention about six months prior to admission; he says that when
seeing commercials on TV asking "hard to get started?" he
thought, "I should get this checked out" medically, but did not.
He says that he sometimes had to stand over the toilet for a
while to get started, and that he sometimes did feel as if there
was urine left, although not so much that he felt like he had to
go right back to the urinal. He denies urinary discomfort or
pain with urination and denies hematuria.
.
He denies any problems with defecation and denies noticing
small-caliber stool or blood in his stool or melena.
.
Currently he feels fairly well. He has a Foley in place and this
is not causing him discomfort.


Past Medical History:
Tonsillectomy at age 7. Generally avoids medical visits.

Social History:
Has worked multiple jobs in the past, but for the past 6 years
has worked as a postal worker loading and sorting priority mail
packages. In the past was an English teacher, then was in sales,
then ran his own painting business, and during a winter in which
he was not getting painting jobs decided to work for the postal
service.
.
He was a smoker from his teen years until about a month before
his admission. Before his admission he drank [**3-20**] drinks a week.
He denies any other drug use.
.
He is married and lives with his wife; they have three daughters
in their 20s, all out of the home, two in college and one
graduated.


Family History:
Father had HTN, died at 91, 92 of "old age" (died on toilet
after long period of weakness/decline starting several years
before)
Mother died in her 80s, was hospitalized much of her life for
schizophrenia
1 sister, age 69; HTN, arthritis

Pertinent Results:
.
KUB [**9-23**]: Again noted are multiple dilated loops of small bowel.
Contrast from prior administration is seen throughout the colon
into the sigmoid and rectum. The degree of distention is
probably unchanged compared with the previous examination.
Nasogastric tube is in place, but the side ports projecting
below the expected location of GE junction.
IMPRESSION: Dilated loops of small bowel and air-filled colon,
probably unchanged in degree compared to the prior study of
[**2191-9-22**].
.
KUB [**9-24**]:Oral contrast is again demonstrated within the colon
with evacuation of a small amount of contrast between the two
studies particularly in the region of the proximal descending
colon and sigmoid region. Dilated, air-filled loops of small
bowel are again demonstrated not substantially changed since the
prior study.
Examination was not tailored for evaluating for free
intraperitoneal air. Additional upright or lateral decubitus
view would be recommended if free air is suspected clinically.
Nasogastric tube has been removed in the interval.
.
KUB [**9-25**]:  No short interval change in gaseous distention to
small or large bowel more suggestive of an ileus. Distal
contrast has passed.
