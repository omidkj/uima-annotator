Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
ICH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71 yo woman transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital after
having unresponsive episode at home followed by vomitting that
was witnessed by husband.  History obtained from husband and [**Name (NI) **]
records as patient is currently intubated. Husband reports
patient had a staring spell followed by dizzy/drunken walking to
the bathroom and being unable to get there in time. She had
urinary incontinence. Patient was subsequently carried to bed by
husband where she was proceeded to vomit. Husband called 911 and
she was taken to [**Hospital3 417**] Hosppital. VS 186/82 88 18 AOx3,
GCS15. For unknown reasons, patient was subsequently intubated.
Head CT revealed large R frontal IPH. She was subsequently
trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.

In ED, BP 122/77 AF. Nsurg was contact[**Name (NI) **] and assess that no
surgical intervention was indicated. Neurology was then
consulted.

Past Medical History:
1. left PICA aneurism clipping after prior SAH [**2126**], [**2129**]
2. two other aneurisms, one at the left C2 segment of the
caroted and another at the ophthalmic segment of the left
internal carotid
3. amyloid angiopathy [**5-28**] - episode of ptosis on the right
along with mild right facial droop in mid-may. MRI showed new
small areas of susceptibility, suggesting amyloid angiopathy.
Often a prodrome for A.D. D/c'd her coumadin and increased the
keppra.
4. osteoporosis
5. generalized convulsive seizures [**11/2128**] - EEG that showed right
frontal theta and sharp waves but no spike-slow waves. There is
evidence of old right frontal infarct where she had prior
intraparenchymal blood at the time of her SAH. She was placed on
AEDs to prevent seizures from this right frontal cortical
lesion.
6. atrial fibrillation/AV paced - h/o vasovagal syncope on
autonomic testing with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], who also has a history of
recurrent palpitations associated with atrial fibrillation and
atrial flutter.

STUDIES:

[**8-28**] Head CT: Unchanged large right frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with intraventricular extension as before. Subfalcine
herniation is unchanged. Newly apparent subarachnoid blood
within the sulci of the left frontal lobe.

[**8-28**] Head CT: Large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage
with intraventricular extension and questionable subfalcine
herniation.

[**8-28**] EEG: This is an abnormal EEG due to the poorly formed
background
activity and bursts of generalized slowing. These abnormalities
suggest
diffuse cortical dysfunction, which may be seen with infections,

medication effect, toxic metabolic abnormalities or ischemia.
The
sharply contoured activity over the F4 electrode was consistent
with
electrode artifact.

EKG: Sinus rhythm. When the sinus rate slows ventricular pacing
is seen. Since the previous tracing of [**2130-5-15**] native beats show
T wave inversions in leads V1-V2.

[**8-29**] CTA Head:
1. No significant interval change in appearance of the brain
compared to yesterday's study. Again demonstrated is a large
right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular
extension and associated subfalcine herniation to the left. A
small amount of subarachnoid blood of the left frontal lobe
sulci appears similar.
2. Patency of the carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations as
well as the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and its major tributaries. See
above report for findings.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, 77RH W w/right frontal ICH that presented with
seizure-like activty (starring) in PM [**8-27**], emesis, all after an
argument with husband. Differential dx included ateriovenous
malformation, aneurysm rupture, mass, hypertension or amyloid
(most likely).

On head CT, there was a 4cm x 13 slices right frontal hemorrhage
with extension to 3rd ventricle.

Her exam revealed patient intubated, withdrew x 2, right gaze
preference, upgoing toes bilaterally.

NEURO:
Patient was admitted to the NeuroICU.  Repeat head CT [**8-28**] showed
no major change.  Patient was weaned and extubated however did
not become more alert or awake despite discontinuing sedating
medications.  Concern that she might be seizing, an EEG was
performed and showed diffuse cortical dysfunction.  She was
started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.  On [**8-29**], patient
developed impaired upgaze, emesis, concern for hydrocephalus.
CTA was negative for aneurysm.  Unable to obtain MRI due to
pacemaker.

Patient was started on mannitol due to increased ventricular
size.  On [**8-31**] Head CT, show increased communicating
hydrocephalus.  Repeat EEG showed [**12-28**] Hz rhythmic spike wave
complexes bifrontal. On keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient continued to
be minimally responsive, not opening eyes and conferred a poor
prognosis for recovery.  Please see below.

CV: Patient was kept on PRN labetelol keeping MAP >105 and <
130.  Patient continued on cardiac telemetry.

PULM: Extubated on [**8-28**] successfully however did not become mo
