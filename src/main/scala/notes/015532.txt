History of Present Illness:
This is a 25 year old woman with a history of asthma and
Ehrlers-Danlos syndrome and currently undergoing IVF treatment
who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital6 33**] with acute
onset shortness of breath. She had 2 embryos implanted on Monday
in her first cycle of IVF. She had ongoing abdominal pain since
the Friday before and had been seen at [**Hospital6 33**]
although it is not clear what happened there. On the morning of
admission she started feeling short of breath, cough, and
pleuritic chest pain that radiated to her back. She took two
puffs of her ProAir which did not significantly help. Her
shortness of breath got worse and so she called EMS.

When EMS arrived they administered an epi pen, nebulizers and
magnesium given concern for an allergic reaction or asthma. At
the outside hospital they started her on steroids. They also did
a CT chest w/contrast to rule out a dissecting aortic aneurysm
given her description of the pain. The timing of the contrast
however was unable to evaluate for a PE. An ABG at OSH showed a
respiratory alkalosis. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
workup.

On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] she was breathing in the 60s and noted to be
very anxious. She had an expiratory wheeze that was felt to be
forced due to her tachypnia. A creatinine was uptrending 0.6 ->
0.9 and a lactate was 8.1. She noted that she had made minimal
urine for the 24 hours prior to coming to ED. A chest x-ray
showed pulmonary edema and bilateral pulmonary effusions. She
received a total of 2mg of ativan for anxiety. Briefly on bipap,
20-25 min, then switched to high flow O2. No actual desats.

A FAST exam (modified because sitting up) but has some fluid in
bilateral lower abdominal quadrants which was felt to be more
than just physiologic. Her VS at the prior to transfer were hr
138 rr 26 sat 97/30% BP 129/70.

On arrival to the MICU she was in visible respiratory distress
breathing about 40 times per minute on a high flow face mask and
complaining of ongoing chest and abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
25 year old woman with a history of asthma recently on IVF who
is presenting with acute onset dyspnea felt to be consistent
with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

# Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome: Her acute dyspnea and
pleural effusions are consistent with this diagnosis.  Given her
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, chest pain and the acute onset of these
symptoms, she had a CTA which was negative for aortic
dissection.  This study did not adequately assess for PE.  Given
her symptoms and the evidence of a S1Q3T3 pattern on her
admission EKG, a second CTA chest was obtained to look for PE
which showed no evidence of PE.  Her ovarian hypersensitivity
syndrome was managed conservatively with cabergoline and gentle
IVF.

# Dyspnea: Patient was tachypneic to 60s on presentation,
resolved with reassurance and pain control. Likely large
component of anxiety on top of pleural effusions and pulmonary
edema. She has an unclear possible history of thrombus. LENIs
were negative for DVT and as above, CTA chest negative for PE.
She was briefly on a heparin gtt until the chest CT results came
back.  Echo showed very small pericardial effusion with no
evidence of tamponade physiology.  She received ATC duonebs for
mild wheezing.

# Concern for Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: Per discussion
with OBGYN there is concern for abdominal compartment syndrome.
When she presented, her abdomen is slightly distended but soft
with mild diffuse tenderness. A bedside ultrasound does not show
any significant drainable pockets of fluid.  Bladder pressure
was 14-16 which was reassuring.  Her abdominal pain improved
throughout her admission although she remained somewhat
distended with known ascites given OHSS.

# Chest Pain: Pleuritic in nature, likely secondary to increased
work of breathing. No evidence of PNA on chest x-ray. As above,
no PE or aortic pathology on CTA chest.  Initial set of cardiac
enzymes negative.

# Hyperglycemia: FS 305, given steroids at OSH, no history of
diabetes. Checked FS QID and were other wise normal.

# Asthma: Reportedly well controlled at home.  She was placed on
standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs q6h given her
respiratory symptoms at admission.

# Leukocytosis: Received steroids at OSH. UA potentially
consistent with UTI however asymptomatic so will await urine
cultures and not treat empirically.

On [**2160-6-19**] she was transferred to the floor from the ICU.  She
did well and was discharged to home on [**2160-6-20**] with follow-up at
[**Location (un) 86**] IVF, possibly for  transvaginal paracentesis.
