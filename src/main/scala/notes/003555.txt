History of Present Illness:
58M w/ IgA predominant multiple myeloma s/p recent high dose
Cytoxan [**2171-5-18**] in preparation for stem cell mobilization
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for febrile neutropenia.

Recently d/c'd from BMT service on [**5-18**] after treatment with
high dose Cytoxan in preparation for stem cell mobilization. Per
pt and wife, he has experienced increased anorexia and some
nausea with one episode of vomitting over the last week. No
fevers or chills. No abdominal pain. Notes thrush but no
dysphagia. Notes onset of cough with white sputum over the last
day. No chest pain. No urinary or bowel changes, no diarrhea. No
rashes. He does have skin breakdown near sacrum which doesn't
appear to have changed significantly. No pain at dialysis
catheter site. No sick contacts. Reports compliance w/ abx and
neupogen. Mild HA but no vision changes. ?mild increased
confusion in terms of getting days of week mixed up. No
neck/back pain.

On evening of admission, he developed nausea and vomitting and
then was noted to have temperature to 101. In ED, noted febrile
to 101.2, tachy to 100, hypotensive to systolic 60's. Labs
notable for neutropenia w/ trilineage decrease. Lactate 1.3. UA
notable for tr ketone and prbc/wbc. CXR w/ increased left sided
pleural effusion. Blood cultures drawn and pt received
Vancomycin and Cefepime and several liters of IVF. SBP improved
to 100's.

Onc. History:
 USOH until [**6-/2170**], when he developed a rotator cuff
injury of his right shoulder. He was initially treated with
supportive therapy. However, he developed progressive pain in
his right clavicle, associated with increasing fatigue. On
further evaluation he was anemic and had a high total protein.
He was hypercalcemic and had a component of renal insufficiency.

He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65635**] on [**2170-7-17**]. Bone marrow
aspirate revealed a hypercellular marrow with 50% plasma cells.
His hemoglobin was 12.4, BUN 39, creatinine was 2.4, and LDH was

normal. On physical examination, he had a 3 cm expandable mass
in his right mid clavicle. He was diagnosed with a stage IIB
IgA kappa multiple myeloma.
.
- Started on high-dose Decadron, thalidomide and Zometa. He
received 100 mg of thalidomide q.h.s. Intially IgA decreased on
this treatment, but he developed progressive renal
insufficiency. Despite a trial of the plasmapheresis, his renal
function continued to deteriorate and he was started on
hemodialysis on [**2170-8-2**].
.
- Prior to his progressive renal insufficiency, he did have an
upper respiratory tract infection characterized by low- grade
fevers and nonproductive cough. All cultures were negative.
Skeletal survey revealed multiple lytic lesions throughout his
thorax. There were lesions in his sternum, posterior ribs, and
vertebral bodies. He continued on Decadron, thalidomide, and
hemodialysis.
.
- In [**10/2170**], he noticed the onset of progressive right hip
pain. This interfered with his ability to walk. Apparently, an
MRI of the area did not reveal a lytic lesion. The question was
raised of avascular necrosis considering his recent use of
steroids. He was noted to have a lytic lesion in his C-spine
and received local radiation therapy, and is advised to wear a
cervical collar.
.
- In the [**12/2170**], he was switched from dexamethasone and low
dose of thalidomide to Velcade + decadron. He has tolerated
the Velcade well. He was seen at the [**Hospital 4601**] Cancer Center
by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**], who recommended that he continue on the
Velcade. He continued to have ongoing renal insufficiency and
was on 3-times- a-week hemodialysis.
.
- He was hospitalized in NH on [**2171-3-25**] with hypotension and
fever.
He was suspected to have adrenal insufficiency, considering his
use of steroids. Blood cultures were positive for coag-negative
staph, and he was started on a course of vancomycin. Dialysis
catheter was changed. A new dialysis catheter was inserted on
[**2171-4-1**]. He continued on HD TIW. [**4-11**]: Noted progressive pain
in his right hip. He is using the wheelchair. He cannot walk
more
than [**Age over 90 **] yards because of pain in his right hip. Repeat MRIs
did not reveal lytic lesions.


Past Medical History:
1. IgA predominant multiple myeloma dx'd [**7-10**] progessive despite
initial therapy w/ Decadron/Thalidomide/Zometa later changed to
Velcade/Decadron now s/p recent high dose Cytoxan [**2171-5-18**] and
awaiting stem cell mobilization
2. ESRD on HD presumed secondary to myeloma
3. recent coag negative staph bacteremia at osh [**3-11**]
4. s/p left av fistula w/ ligation during hospitalization [**5-11**]
5. ?adrenal insuffiency at osh
6. htn
7. hyperlipidemia
8. cervical lytic lesion
9. ?restrictive lung pattern by pft (fev1/fvc 117% predicted w/
fev1 of 68% predicted, and decreased TLC)

.
# Febrile neutropenia:  Patient with nausea, vomiting and caugh
prior to admission.  Sources include lungs, ?secondary to decub
(only stage 1), or line related (has tunnled line catheter).  He
was admitted to the ICU initially and received IVF for
hypotension.  He defervasced and once hemodynamically stable was
transferred to the floor.  After transfer he was continued on
Cefepime, Vancomycin (by level) and levofloxacin.  He was noted
to have a pleural effusion which was tapped and revealed a
transudate with no organisms on gram stain and cultures.  During
his hospitalization he was converted to hospice care, and
patient was sent home off Abx.
.
# Pleural effusion:  noted to have pleural effusion on
echocardiogram so had a Chest CT which revevealed a large
leftsided effusion.  This was tapped and revealed a transudate.
Patient's sob and dyspnea improved significantly after
thoracentesis.  2 days later sob worsened and on CXR was noted
to have recurrance of pleural effusion.  Effusion was thought
likely secondary to inflammatory reaction to the plasmacytomas
seen on CT.  Rad/Onc was consulted for possible radiation to the
plasmacytoma, however they did not believe that radiation would
change management as pt had several lesions.  Interventional
pulmonary was consulted for possible pleuradisis vs pigtail
catheter placement given quick reaccumulation of the effusion.
They did not believe that pleuradisis would be useful as the
effusion was a transudate.  Repeat thoracentesis was perfored on
[**6-1**].  Pt was successfully extubated on [**6-4**], and continued to
oxygenate well on supplemental o2.
.
# Mutliple myeloma - Once afebrile pt underwent pharesis for
stem cell collection.  He had 3 cycles however the yield was low
and for now the plan is to hold off on further stem cell
collection.  Further work up and management per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].
Supportive meastures for pain control with fentynyl patch and
oxycodone, cervical collar and levaquin and bactrim prophylaxis
were continued.
