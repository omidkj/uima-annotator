Service:  MICU [**Location (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: [**Last Name (un) 24527**] [**Known lastname 97946**] is a
seventy-two-year-old man with a past medical history
significant for ischemic heart disease, pulmonary
hypertension, secondary to emphysema, recently admitted for
exacerbation of congestive heart failure with hypoxia and
fluid overload. The patient was re-admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2186-11-17**], for increasing edema
and shortness of breath. The patient also had two days of
weakness. The patient was seen on the night prior to
admission by a visiting nurse who noted hypotension with a
blood pressure of 90/60, a dry mouth, little edema and dry
lungs. The patient presented to the Emergency Department on
the following morning for evaluation. The patient was
admitted to the general medical service for treatment of his
shortness of breath and weakness. On [**2186-11-22**], he was
transferred to the MICU [**Location (un) **] service after having a PEA
arrest. A phlebotomist found him slumped over in his chair
and cyanotic at 6:15 in the morning. A code was called. The
patient was given Epinephrine and a pulse was regained. The
patient was subsequently transferred to the CCU for further
care. The MICU service assumed care for [**Last Name (un) 24527**] [**Known lastname 97946**],
given his situation. It is unknown how [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 24527**] [**Known lastname 97946**]
was without oxygen or without a pulse during this first
arrest. Upon admission to the MICU service, a head CT scan
was obtained which did not show any bleeding or any other
intracranial events. [**Last Name (un) 24527**] [**Known lastname 97946**] had been intubated and
had a right subclavian introducer placed during the code,
during his resuscitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On physical examination at the time of
admission to the MICU, vital signs, temperature 99.4 F, heart
rate 92, blood pressure 114/48. The patient's ventilator was
set on assist control 40% FIO2, title volume 560 spontaneous,
500 set, respirations 20 with 12 set PEEP set at 7.5,
saturation oxygen 95%. The patient's CVP was 12. Initial
blood gas on 100% FIO2 was 7.38/41/376. Generally, intubated,
unresponsive. Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination,
pupils were equal, reactive, round, reactive to
accommodation. Eyes without purposeful movement, deviated to
the left bilaterally. Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube
in place. The neck was supple, no bruits. Chest, lungs clear
with good air movement bilaterally, diffuse expiratory
wheezes, right subclavian cordis with the triple lumen
catheter placed through it. No erythema or induration.
Cardiovascular, regular, no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdomen
was soft, nondistended, active bowel sounds. Extremities, no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Feet are cool to palpation, poor
peripheral pulses, not palpable. Neurologic, pupils were
equal bilaterally, reactive, corneal reflexes intact. Gag
reflex present with deep suction. Sensation to pain with
minimal movement of both upper extremities. Deep tendon
reflexes 0/4 times four extremities.

LABORATORY VALUES: White blood cell count 10.1, hematocrit
37.2, platelet count 185.

Sodium 142, potassium 4.6, chloride 106, HCO3 18, blood, urea
and nitrogen 18, creatinine 1.1, glucose 154.

Calcium 6.6, magnesium 1.9, phosphorous 4.6.

Prothrombin time 15.2, international normalized ratio 1.6,
partial prothrombin time 33.1.

Lipase 44.

Digoxin level 1.1.

Creatine kinase initially was 156, next value twelve hours
685, MB initially was 2, MB twelve hours later was 46,
Troponin was greater then 50.

Urinalysis showed large blood, negative nitrate, negative
leukocyte esterase, trace ketones, greater then 50 red blood
cells, urine creatinine 132, urine sodium less then 10.

Chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax, right subclavian line in
place, bilateral effusions, no evidence of congestive heart
failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE: During the course of admission to the MICU
service, [**Last Name (un) 24527**] [**Known lastname 97946**] had several events of desaturation.
The patient responded to bagging with 100% FIO2 with an Ambu
bag. At 4:30 a.m. on [**2186-11-24**], [**Last Name (un) 24527**] [**Known lastname 97946**] had a PEA
arrest while obtaining a repeat head CT scan. The patient was
resuscitated with a dose of Epinephrine and Atropine, pulse
was regained. Head CT scan revealed no bleeding, edema or any
other intracranial processes. Also during the course of
hospitalization, he had an electroencephalogram which showed
slow wave forms consistent with anoxic injury. At 12 p.m. on
[**2186-11-24**], [**Last Name (un) 24527**] [**Known lastname 97946**] had a third PEA arrest. All
measures were taken to resuscitate him. He was intubated, he
was being oxygenated with an Ambu bag. The patient was
receiving normal saline, intravenous fluids wide open. A
potassium was sent stat, it came back at 5.2. Breath sounds
were equal, no evidence of pneumothorax or cardiac tamponade.
The patient was given five 1 mg doses of Epinephrine, six
1 mg doses of Atropine, four doses of calcium chloride, one
dose of sodium bicarbonate, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was
continued throughout the course of this resuscitation.
Fourteen minutes after losing a pulse, a pulse was regained.
This pulse quickly disappeared and he subsequently went into
ventricular fibrillation on the cardiac monitor. The
patient's automatic implanted cardiac defibrillator monitor
shocked him three times, each time returning it to
ventricular fibrillation. When his automatic implanted
cardiac defibrillator did not continue to defibrillate, he
was defibrillated with external paddles at 200 joules,
followed by 300 joules, followed by 360 joules. After the
third shock, the cardiac monitor demonstrated asystole. The
monitor leads were checked. Asystole was confirmed. At 12:24,
twenty-four minutes after initial arrest, the code stopped
and time of death was pronounced at 12:24.

DISCHARGE CONDITION: Deceased.

DISCHARGE STATUS: Deceased.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Ischemic cardiomyopathy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: None.
