History of Present Illness:
This is a 80M with systolic and diastolic CHF, ESRD on HD m/w/f,
2V CABG in [**2161**], hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes
mellitus, peripheral arterial disease, presenting with shortness
of breath over the past week. The patient is currently residing
at [**Hospital **] rehab and began to complain of chest tightness and
pressure on [**10-25**]. he was brought to [**Hospital **] hospital where he
was hypotensive 79/54 and 98% on NRB. ekg did not show any
ischemic changes. The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial blood pressure was 100/53. This
transiently decreased to 86/45, a right EJ was placed and
dopamine was begun. CXR showed bilateral infiltrates consistent
with CHF exacerbation, and BNP was also elevated to 38,495. The
patient expressed wishes to be DNI and was begun on CPAP. He
became disoriented on CPAP and was switched to BiPap. VBG was
7.36/52. The patient was begun on vancomycin, flagyl, and
ceftriaxone. Bedside echo did not reveal effusion or tamponade.
Vitals after administration of dopamine were 97.7, 71, 105/60,
19 O2 sat 80-90% on 10L NRB.
He denies fevers, weight loss, headaches, hematochezia, melena,
joint pains. he reports substernal chest pain, difficulty
breathing, and orthopnea.
.
MICU course:
Pt was syncopizing at HD and was unable to tolerate full fluid
removal at HD and became progressively more fluid overloaded.
Has been on CVVH since admission with significant improvement.
Dopamine switched to levo x 2 days, d/c'd yesterday. BPs have
been stable at . ? sepsis. Received empiric CTX and vanc, now on
augmentin for UTI (ucx from OSH with ESBL e-coli, s to
augmentin, plan to complete course for this) currently day [**2-15**].
Plan to HD today (first time this admission) CVVH stopped this
am. Has a RIJ CVL, also has R SC tunneled HD line also has L
midline. BPs 114/51 94.

Brief Hospital Course:
80M with hx CHF (EF 30%), ESRD on HD, p/w hypotension and
pressor-dependent HD.

# Comfort measures only (CMO) status and subsequent death:  In
brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 25143**] experienced multiple adverse health events
during his hospital stay, including infections, cerebrovascular
accident in the setting of hypotension, deep vein thromboses,
and episodes of acute respiratory distress.  He expressed a
desire to no longer undergo dialysis or other interventions such
as nasopharangeal suction during his episodes of respiratory
distress.  His comorbidites and wishes were discussed with his
family, and his family members made the decision to change the
goals of care to comfort measures.  Hemodialysis was withheld
and the patient subsequently expired on [**2167-11-28**].   The
immediate cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest.

# CVA:  Patient had altered mental status and dysarthria after
HD on [**2167-11-16**].  As described above, he was hypotensive to a SBP
of 70 during hemodilaysis and likely suffered a hypoperfusive
stroke.  His Head CT was negative for acute changes, though it
did show progression of chronic, right frontal subcortical
changes.  He was , advanced since prior head CT in [**5-13**], but no
acute evidence of infarction.

# Acute on chronic left ventricular systolic and diastolic
dysfunction:  The patient was admitted to the intensive care
unit upon admission and diuresed with CVVH with support with
norepinephrine infusion. He was felt to be in decompensated
heart failure with pulmonary edema as well as decreased cardiac
output. He was transitioned to the floor, but then quickly had
recurrence of pulmonary edema requiring ICU transfer. He was
further diuresed with CVVH but required vasopressor support for
fluid removal. He was briefly covered with antibiotics in case
pneumonia/infection was contributing to respiratory distress.
Patient was then transitioned back to hemodialysis without
pressor support.  Afterload was aided with daily midodrine, and
initially, with hydrocortisone.  He appeared to be tolerating
dialysis well until [**2167-11-16**] when he had an altered mental
status acutely after dialysis during a session in which his SBP
fell to 70.  His altered mental status was attributed to a
likely CVA in the setting of hypotension.

# Urinary Tract Infection:  The patient had an outside hospital
urine culture grow EColi ESBL, but susceptible to augmentin and
zosyn. He was initially treated with augmentin, and then changed
to meropenem. After 9 days of therapy, he had a repeat U/A that
showed pyuria, and was restarted on meropenem.  His UTI appeared
to resolve but another urine culture taken approximately one
week prior to his death was again positive for enterococcus
sensitive to only linezolid and doxycycline.  He was treated
with linezolid until the decision to make his CMO was reached.

# C diff:  Patient had loose stools and a C diff toxin was
positive.  He was treated with flagyl.

# Right pleural effusion:  On admission, the patient was noted
to have a developing right pleural effusion, but the family and
the patient initally refused thoracentesis.  With elevated white
count and fever spike, empiric antibiotics were started with
meropenem because of concern for parapnuemonic effusion.
[**Hospital **] health care proxy then agreed to thoracentesis, which
was performed, removing
