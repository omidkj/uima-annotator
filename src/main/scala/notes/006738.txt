IMAGING:
.
[**2147-8-7**] CTA Chest:
1. Ground-glass airspace opacity involving the majority of the
left lung and also within the right middle lobe concerning for
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]. Please note other etiologic considerations
include atypical pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
2. Status post right lower lobe resection with open window
thoracoplasty
changes and packing material in the right pleural space.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Stable small filling
defect within the right lower lobe pulmonary artery is
compatible with chronic thrombus related to right lower lobe
resection.
4. Extensive left coronary artery calcification.
5. Prominent but stable mediastinal lymph nodes.
6. Multiple thoracic spine compression fractures, with a new T5
compression.
7. Hypodense lesion in segment VII of the liver, incompletely
characterized though appears new. Consider MR for further
evaluation.
8. Nodular contour of the liver. Recommend clinical correlation
for
cirrhosis.
.
[**2147-8-8**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Doppler parameters are
most consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-6-21**],
the heart rate is now higher so there is less time for LV
relaxation.
.
[**2147-8-9**] Path:
1.  Skin, abdomen, biopsy:
- Discrete inflamed scale crust overlying hair follicle
consistent with resolving folliculitis (see note).
- Dermal hemorrhage.
Note: PAS-D and Gram stains are negative for fungal and
bacterial organisms respectively.  There is dermal hemorrhage,
however, no significant dermal inflammation or vasculitis is
observed.
2.  Skin, right shin, biopsy (B):
Diffuse dermal hemorrhage consistent with ecchymosis (see note).
Note:   There is dermal hemorrhage, however, no significant
dermal inflammation or vasculitis is observed.
.
[**2147-8-10**] BAL cytology: ATYPICAL. Rare group of atypical
epithelioid and squamous cells. Numerous neutrophils and
pulmonary macrophages.

Brief Hospital Course:
70M with HIV (undetectable VL), inflammatory arthritis on
chronic steroid therapy, SCC s/p RLL lobectomy [**8-7**] complicated
by bronchopleural fistula treated with [**Last Name (un) 72968**] window, as well
as empyema and invasive aspergillosis on outpatient voriconazole
admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and septic shock
from pneumonia.
.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient presented with
hypoxemic respiratory failure. He required intubation on
[**2147-8-8**].  Due to right sided air leak and dense disease on left
lung it was difficult to ventilate the patient with a single
endotracheal tube. He was switched to a double lumen
endotracheal tube on [**2147-8-9**] that was much better tolerated.
History, exam, and imaging were suggestive of infectious
etiology.  Multiple blood and sputum cultures were o
