Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
"Weakness"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
80 yo female with HTN otherwise no cardiac risk factor who
developed acute onset of malaise/"weakness" 8:30am this morning.
 Pt denies chest pain, SOB, diaphoresis, palpitation, dizziness,
nausea/vomiting.  Pt resumed her morning activity of feeding her
farm animals, and called her son because of persistent
fatigue/malaise, who called the EMS.  EMS found BP 140/83, EKG
en route found to have ST elevation in the inferior leads (II,
III, AVF) and V5-V6, and ST depression in I, aVL, V1-V2).  Pt
got SLNTG x2, ASA, NS IVF and sent her to [**Hospital3 4107**].  At
[**Name (NI) **], pt got Plavix 300 mg, IV Heparin started, Integrillin
started, IV Lopressor 5 mg x2, po lipitor 20 mg.  SBP in
140-150s at [**Hospital1 **].  Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emrgent cath.
Time of arrial to [**Hospital1 **]: 1020.  Time of balloon inflation at
[**Hospital1 18**] 11:43.  repeat EKG showed ST depression in II, III, aVF,
and ST depression in I, aVL, V2-V4.  In the cath lab, pt noted
to have 100% mid-LCx (old) w/ large OM1 filling via collaterals.
 30% RCA ostial, 100% proximal with thrombus.  When ballon was
dialted, pt transiently vagal rxn requiring atropine and
temporary pacing.  RCA was stented with 3.5 x 33 mm Cypher stent
with 0% residual in-stent, 10% residual at distal stent.
Transient slow flow treated with IV diltiazem.

Pertinent Results:
Cath ([**1-16**]): 1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a
right-dominant system with severe 2-vessel coronary disease. The
LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenoses. The LCx was
chronically occluded in the mid-vessel. A large OM1 branch fills
primarily via left-left collaterals from the LAD. The RCA is a
large vessel with a 30% ostial stenosis and was thrombotically
occluded in the proximal portion. The RPDA fills via collaterals
from the LAD. 2. Hemodynamics performed post-PCI revealed mildly
elevated right- and moderately elevated left-sided filling
pressures (mean RA 12 mmHg, mean PCW 19 mmHg). The pulmonary
artery pressure was mildly elevated at 26 mmHg. The cardiac
index was normal at 3.1 L/min/m2. There was moderate systemic
arterial hypertension (systolic pressure 167 mmHg). 3. Stenting
of the RCA was performed with a 3.5 x 33 mm Cypher DES.

Echo ([**1-17**]): EF 40-45% The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include inferior and inferolateral akinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)CAD: Pt had an inferior MI with an unusual presentation that
she never experienced chest pain.  Peak CK/MB was 1599/173.  She
had a total occlusion of proximal RCA with thrombus which was
successfully treated with Cypher.  Mid-LCx had a chronic
occlusions with collaterals filling OM1.  Since the LCx lesion
was old and unlikely the culprit lesion, plus with good
collaterals, it was decided not to go for a second cath for its
intervention.  The hemodynamics from the cath was C.O. 5.28,
C.I. 3.12 PCWP 18 RA 11 PA 25 RV 39/9 with no hemodynamic
evidence of right ventricular MI.  Pt did well post-cath and was
discharged with ASA 325 mg po qd, Lipitor 80 mg po qd, Toprol 50
mg po qd.  Pt will need nuclear stress test in [**5-8**] weeks to
assess for revesible defect in the LCx region.

2)Pump: EF 40-45% The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral akinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  Pt
showed no signs of fluid overload and was discharged with the
above meds.

3)Rhythm: Pt remained in sinus rhythm with occasional PVC's.

4)HTN: Pt was switched from Norvasc to Toprol for BP control.

5)Hyperlipidemia: Pt was started on Lipitor 80 mg po qd.
