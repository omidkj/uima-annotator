Allergies:
Lorazepam

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
NSVT, PVCs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Multi-lumen PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
62 m with hx of HTN, HL, PE x 2 s/p IVC filter and on heparin,
morbid obesity, who was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**1-20**]
with dyspnea and weakness. He was found to have a septic knee
replacement and was sent to NEBH for washout and hardware
removal on [**2184-2-3**]. Knee cultures showed coag negative staph. He
was hypotensive and was sent to the ICU, where he was treated
with penicillin for his staph infection. He was also noted to
have a gout flare for which he was started on colchicine. He
developed ARF which was felt to be pre-renal and responded to
fluids.

From the cardiac standpoint he was noted to have multiple runs
of NSVT (3-5 beats) for which cardiology was consulted and
recommended beta-blockade. He also had a TnI of 0.34 for which
it was recommended he undergo a MIBI. However he was too heavy
to undergo this test and had a fair amount of ectopy when his
beta-blocker was discontinued in anticipation of a dobutamine
echo. He was restarted on his beta blocker and it was felt that
he did not need further workup as he had a negative stress last
year.

In regards to his surgery, he underwent resection arthroplasty
of left knee with insertion of cement antibiotic spacers on [**2-3**].
His EBL was 3.2 liters. Extubated on [**2-4**]. The patient had
post-surgical non-oliguric [**Last Name (un) **] with increase of BUN/creatinine
to 18/0.9 to 42/5.0. He also developed ileus on [**2-7**], and was
not absorbing any PO, subsequently NG decompressed.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2184-1-21**] MABH:
This is a technically difficult study. LV dimensions are normal.
LV systolic function is at the lower limits of normal with an
estimated EF of 55%. The right ventricle is mildly dilated with
preserved RV systolic function. There is mild to moderate left
atrial and mild right atrial enlargement. The aortic leaflets
are minimally thickened with no AR. The mitral leaflets are
minimally thickened with trace MR. There is trace TR. No
pericardial effusion is seen. Compared to a prior study dated
[**2183-2-3**], the right ventricle is now noted to be dilated.

P-MIBI [**2183-2-3**]:
Frequent APCs and PVCs were seen. Patient had no symptoms of
chest pain. There were no EKG changes seen. No evidence for
jeopardized myocardium. Findings consistent with the
diaphragmatic attenuation or inferior wall scar. Low normal
ejection fraction (49%) and normal wall motion.
.
KUB: Technically limited study with poor penetration.
Non-obstructive
bowel gas pattern with no dilated loops of small or large bowel.
No evidence of pneumoperitoneum. Lung bases are clear. No soft
tissue calcification or radiopaque foreign bodies. Visualized
osseous structures demonstrate multilevel degenerative changes
with extensive degenerative change seen within the right hip.
IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern.
.
Knee films: Washout with hardware at outside hospital for septic

knee. Evaluate hardware and soft tissues.
Two views of the left knee are obtained without prior studies
available for comparison. There is methyl methacrylate spacer at
the knee joint with
additional methyl methacrylate in the suprapatellar bursa. There
is a
moderate joint effusion. Patient is status post osteotomy at the
proximal
tibia and distal femur. Status post hardware removal. There is
mild lucency about the methacrylate in the proximal tibia, but
this may have been secondary to prior hardware. Outside
radiographs would be helpful for assessment.
.
Renal ultrasound: Despite repositioning attempts, the kidneys
were unable to be visualized secondary to patient's large body
habitus.
IMPRESSION: Unable to visualize kidneys secondary to body
habitus.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o M with HTN, HL, gout, morbid obesity, recurrent PE's s/p
IVC filter, T2DM, s/p left knee arthroplasty for septic joint,
complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Creatinine reportedly increased to 5,
from baseline of 0.8 at OSH and trended up to a stable 6.6 while
in the MICU. OSH renal ultrasound, urine eos unrevealing. Renal
ultrasound could not be repeated here given his body habitus and
positioning issues. Potentially [**1-27**] ATN, given patient's volume
overloaded state. Reportedly aggressively volume resuscitated at
OSH. Renal was consulted and felt patient was continuing to
third space. They recommended continuing lasix 40mg IV daily and
monitoring BUN/Creatinine, urine output and electrolytes. Did
not feel hemodialysis was indicated at this time. The patient
was able to produce urine. With lasix use, he was around
negative 1 liter a day at the end of his hospitalization. He
should continue lasix for three more days after hospitalization.
His renal function continues to improve with a Cr of 2.9 at
discharge. The patient continues to hav
