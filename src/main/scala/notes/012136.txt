Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Outpatient cardiologist: [**Last Name (un) 27328**]

CC: Chest pain

HPI:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is 59F with COPD, OSA, steroid-induced hyperglycemia,
thalasemia minor, morbid obesity, moderate to severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9
by cath [**10-26**])diastolic heart failure who presents with chest
pain and SOB.

The day of presentation the patient reports to waking up SOB. Pt
felt this was realted to her COPD and took her inhalers (xopinex
and advair) and she said it didnt help. Her SOB got worse when
she was in teh car driving while she was feeling anxious she
would arrive late to her doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 3726**]. She then noticed chest
discomfort in the center of her chest with a "burning"
sensation. She says that last night she ate hotdogs and drank 64
ounces of fluids because she felt very thirsty. Pt reports
episodes where she feels SOB that usually get better with
xopinex though this episode felt more severe than usual. The
patient reports having a cardiac cath done in [**9-/2109**] and
reports having a 10% blockage.

As per EMS, the patient had wide complex tachycardia at 130 bpm
and is s/p amiodarone bolus. In the ED, she was hypotensive to
70-80s, initially tachypneic and diaphoretic.  The patient was
also given  nitroglycerin and fluids and CP resolved.  EKG
showed sinus tachycardia at 114 with LBBB and 3mm discordant ST
deviation.  EKG from [**2107**] in NSR with LVH.  Of note, patient
reports having LBBB in the past.

In the ED: 124 190/160 28 98% NRB
EMS gave her 150 amiodarone for wide complex tachycardia. EKG
showed LBBB, notified that she had known LBBB 1 month ago in ED.
Cardiology was consulted. Echo showed moderate AS. CTA neg for
PE or pneumonia.

BP initialy 190s, given 2 SL nitro. Still had chest pain in ED
and BP 140s. Given 2.5mg morphine. BP 80s-> 70s. Given 5 L NS.
Blood pressure in the 90-110s.

Patient was given ASA 81, 2 Nitro SL, 2.5mg morphine, heparin
gtt (for possible ACS), Amiodarone 150 from EMS, Levo 0.3, 5 L
Normal Saline. Before coming to the CCU she was weaned off the
levo.
Access: 2 peripherals 20g

TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of syncope or
presyncope. Does note chest pain and pedal edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:
59F with COPD, morbid obesity, moderate to severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9 by
cath [**10-26**]) who presents with chest pain and SOB, admitted to
the CCU for hypotension.

ACUTE ISSUES
#Chest Pain +SOB/Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure:
Differential includeded aortic stenosis, acute on chronic
diastolic heart failure, pulmonary HTN from OSA, COPD exac, PE,
ACS, aortic dissection. Likely acute diastolic heart failure in
the setting of eating lots of hot dogs which are high in salt
and drinking 64 ounces of fluids the night before.. Also there
was pulmonary edema on CXR. Also possible was pulmonary HTN from
OSA as she has not been on CPAP for 6 yrs. Pulmonary embolism
was ruled out by normal CTPE. COPD less likely as no cough, no
sputum, no wheeze. Troponins negative and no EKG changes to
suggest ACS. Pt with RA and at risk of pericarditis which can
also present with chest pain and SOB, but no EKG or echo
findings to support that. Most likely etiology for SOB and chest
pain was acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. Patient was
diuresed with IV lasix and eventually weaned off oxygen. While
she was here we held her diclofenac. We also stopped her
dilitiazem which we feel is not an optimal medication for her
diastolic hearrt failure and started her on metoprolol. I called
her PCP's office and left a message for her PCP about the
medication changes we are making. In particular we are
discontinuing her diltiazem as it is not an optimal medication
for heart failure and we are starting metoprolol. We also
recommended she not take NSAIDs as they can cause fluid
retention as well.


#Blood pressure: Pt was hypotensive (down to 70s) in the ER
requiring levophed however on arrival to the CCU BP is 140/80s
and she was weaned off the pressor. Differential for her
hypotension included pharmacologic including IV amiodarone and
SL nitro given in ER, tachcyardia induced hypotension is
considered,
