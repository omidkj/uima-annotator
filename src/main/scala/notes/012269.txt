History of Present Illness:
57yo woman with h/o gastric bypass in [**2147**] comlicated by ventral
hernia and ulcer near the anastomotic site presented with coffee
ground emesis. She described several episodes of vomiting in the
preceding days, followed by [**1-26**] bouts of coffee ground emesis,
reportedly about [**1-26**] cups in total. She also described ongoing
"gnawing" pain consistent with the pain previously attributed to
her ulcer disease. She denied any melena or hematochezia. Of
note, she reported having run out of her PPI 2weeks ago.
Otherwise, review of systems was only positive for resolved
lightheadedness. She had no chest pain or dyspnea.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was guaiac positive. NG lavage was positive with
coffee grounds, turned into bright red blood after 750cc. Pt was
tachy to 100s, SBP in 120s. GI was consulted. She was admitted
to the MICU. Her Hct had trended down from 36 to 27.
.
In the MICU, she received IVF, was started on IV PPI gtt, and
underwent endoscopy. This was notable for a near-circumferential
ulceration at the gastro-jejunal anastamosis site. There was
fresh clot, and further areas of bleeding were cauterized.
Thereafter, she remained hemodynamically stable, Hct remained
stable, and she had no further episodes of hematemesis.
.
On interview now, she confirms no further episodes of
hematemesis, denies any chest pain or shortness of breath, and
otherwise has no new complaints on review of systems.
