Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
66 yo male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
congestive heart failure with EF 30-40% in [**2177**] by recent
evaluation NYHA Class I, presents with acute onset dyspnea this
AM. The patient reports the last few days he has awoken with
some dyspnea at rest. This has resolved through the course of
the day prior to today. Today, his symptoms progressed to being
unable to speak in full sentences. He denies any associated
chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, abd pain, or nausea. He
does report over the same amount of time he was experiencing
left leg pain, around his left knee which he attributed to gout.
He reports bilateral leg swelling, to which he normally takes
lasix PRN for.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.6 HR 78 BP 120/75 RR 35
O2Sat 94% on BiPAP. He had a chest x-ray showed marginal
evidence of volume overload. He was given lasix 40mg IV X1 and
levaquin 750mg IV X1. The patient has had 800ccs of urine output
since the lasix. As he was grossly hypoxic, he was placed on
BiPap with decreased work of breathing and increased O2 sat.
Attempts to remove BiPap resulted in increased work of breathing
and hypoxia down to 82% on RA. An ABG was sent off Bipap which
showed marked hypoxia and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and
respiratory alkalosis.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2179-10-28**]**

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2179-10-28**]):    NO GROWTH.

TTE [**10-22**]:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis and extensive distal LV akinesis (LVEF
25-30%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2178-8-27**], LV systolic function may have slightly
deteriorated. Pulmonary pressures are higher today. The other
findings appear similar.

CTA chest [**10-22**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection.

2. Diffuse central perihilar ground-glass opacification,
bilateral pleural
effusions, non-bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary
artery
hypertension is most consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary
edema.
Differential diagnosis, however, does include interstitial
pneumonia such as
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] well as pulmonary hemorrhage, drug hypersensitivity,
sarcoid and
alveolar proteinosis although these seem less likely. Recommend
rescan after
treatment to ensure no underlying process.

3. Vascular including dense coronary artery calcifications.

4. Appparent thickening of left atrial appendage may artifactual
due to wall
apposition or could represent thrombus. Correlation with
clinical history and
echocardiogram suggested.

EKG [**10-22**]:
Normal sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats. RSR'
pattern in
lead V2. Non-specific T wave changes. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2178-11-5**] there are now frequent ventricular premature beats.
The
non-specific T wave changes were also present at that time. No
other
diagnostic interval change.
