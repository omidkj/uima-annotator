Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is an 81 year old woman with no
significant past medical history or cardiac risk factors,
transferred from an outside hospital with anterior myocardial
infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was in her usual
state of health until the Friday before admission when she
felt short of breath after walking up a [**Doctor Last Name **] near her home.
She normally walks this route without difficulty.  The
shortness of breath was not associated with chest pain,
nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis and resolved quickly.

On the Saturday prior to admission, she experienced similar
isolated shortness of breath while on a shopping trip.  The
same evening she noted the onset of vague nonradiating
epigastric discomfort that made it difficult for her to
sleep.  This was associated with intermittent nausea but no
vomiting.

She denied frank chest pain or shortness of breath at this
point. She denies history of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or
orthopnea.  She has no cardiac risk factors.  The discomfort
was constant and progressive throughout the day on Sunday.
On Sunday evening, she was again unable to sleep due to
epigastric discomfort and nausea prompting her family to take
her to [**Hospital3 68**].

At [**Hospital3 68**], she was found to have ST segment
elevations and a CK of 211.  She was treated with Aspirin,
Heparin, Lopressor and Nitroglycerin prior to being
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
emergent catheterization.  The Nitroglycerin therapy was
discontinued prior to transfer due to one episode of low
blood pressure.

At [**Hospital1 69**], she was taken to
emergent catheterization and found to have a proximal
Left anterior descending occlusion with dual ostia that was
angioplastied and stented.  Her pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 23.  Cardiac index was 1.6.  Cardiac output was
2.7.  The procedure was complicated by a fifteen second
ventricular fibrillation arrest that was treated immediately
and successfully with 200 joules.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Meniere's disease.
2.  Total hip replacement with redo.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Meclizine.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco or alcohol use.
The patient lives at home with her husband and daughter in
[**Name (NI) **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  On admission, vital signs revealed
temperature 97.2, blood pressure 139/77, heart rate 100,
respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 94% on two liters.  In
general, the patient was alert and oriented times three in no
apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination was anicteric.  The pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  Neck revealed no lymphadenopathy, no carotid
bruit bilaterally.  Chest - good aeration, inspiratory
crackles bilaterally to the apices and end expiratory wheeze.
Cardiovascular examination - regular rate and rhythm, normal
S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops noted.  Abdominal
examination was benign.  Extremities were warm, pulses 2+ and
extremities were not edematous bilaterally.  Neurologically,
cranial nerves II through XII are intact, no gross motor
deficits noted.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium 138, potassium 3.5,
chloride 101, bicarbonate 23, blood urea nitrogen 18,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 239.  White blood cell count 19.0,
hematocrit 43.9, platelets 311,000.  Prothrombin time 12.8,
INR 1.1, partial thromboplastin time 30.3.  CK 8,375, MB
fraction 1,495.

Electrocardiogram on admission revealed ST elevation in leads
I, aVL, V2 through V5 and ST depression in leads I, II and
aVF.

Chest x-ray revealed increased vascular markings,
cephalization and diffuse opacities consistent with mild
congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - Following cardiac catheterization, the
patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit.  The patient
was started on Aspirin, Aggrestat times 18 hours and Plavix.
The patient's lipid panel was checked and LDL was found to be
above 100 and thus the patient was started on a low dose
statin.  The patient's CK levels were followed during
admission.  The last recorded CK on the day of admission was
180.

During admission, the patient underwent an echocardiogram to
assess ventricular function.  There was felt to be
significant ventricular hypokinesis and akinesis warranting
institution of anticoagulation.  The patient was also gently
diuresed with Lasix and placed on a standing dose of 40 mg
Lasix q.d.  The patient was also started on a dose of
Lopressor once mild congestive heart failure had stabilized.
An ace inhibitor was also administered.  The patient's blood
pressure ranged from 90 to 110 during admission with periodic
decreases in blood pressure to the mid 80s.  None of these
decreases in systolic blood pressure were symptomatic.  The
patient will follow-up with her primary care physician for
referral to cardiologist.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient's small oxygen requirement
resolved quickly with gentle diuresis following
catheterization.  Her oxygen saturation remained in the high
90s in room air thereafter.

3.  Hematology - The patient was noted to have a small groin
hematoma following catheter sheath removal. This hematoma was
stable throughout the entire admission.  There was no
extension of hematoma noted and her hematocrit was stable.
The patient was started on Heparin and Coumadin for
anticoagulation while in house.  The patient will follow-up
with her primary care physician for optimization of her
anticoagulation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Large anterior myocardial infarction.
2.  Mild congestive heart failure.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. times thirty days.
5.  Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous q12hours times three days.
6.  Coumadin 2.5 mg q.d.
7.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge to home.
