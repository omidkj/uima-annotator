Attending:[**Doctor First Name 16571**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 64 year-old female with a PMH significant for
ASD repair with patch in [**11/2158**] complicated by sternal wound
infection, post-op afib, and C. diff colitis; tobacco use, COPD,
and HTN presenting with intermittent back pain and worsening SOB
from baseline. The back pain has been present for several
weeks-it was initially intermittent and then became constant.
For the last several days she has complained of increasing
shortness of breath. She denies having chest pain, fever/ chills
or cough. She has constant nausea, which is her baseline for
several weeks.  She denied any infectious contacts.  She usually
takes lasix for lower extremity edema but has not had worsening
edema recently; however, stopped taking her Lasix several days
ago because of aggravation with the frequent urination. She was
referred to an OSH ER where CXRs were obtained. On her way home
from the OSH ER she was contact[**Name (NI) **] by her primary care physician
who told her to go to [**Hospital1 18**] ER because her CXR was concerning
for a mass in her chest.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was afebrile. CT chest demonstrated diffuse
LAD (+/- mass) and postobstructive pneumonia. This is a new
finding, although there are no other CT scans in our system. Her
sternal wound has continued nonunion. She was seen by the CT
[**Doctor First Name **] PA who thought there was no active CSurg issues. She was
seen by the plastics team who also thought there were no active
wound issues. She came in with a HR 170 in atrial fibrillation
with ST depressions in the lateral leads. Cardiology was
consulted who thought the PAF was related to the pneumonia. She
was initially rate controlled with IV diltiazem, but her home po
metoprolol was not started. She received IV vancomycin and IV
levofloxacin for her postobstructive pneumonia. She refused
flagyl given previous history of GI side effects, but is willing
to reconsider if her clinical status worsens.
.
On initial MERIT evaluation, she was in NSR with rates in the
90s. She had not received po vancomycin since ED arrival. She
was restarted on home medications including nebs. Per discussion
with ID, the antibiotics she received were acceptable. She has
C.difficle infection, and she was restarted on po vancomycin.
She continues to complain of mild shortness of breath, although
is overall improved. She has continued nausea. She spits up
white sputum.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
GENERAL: She is a chronically ill-appearing female in no acute
distress.
HEENT: Unremarkable.
LYMPHATICS: She has no cervical, axillary, or supraclavicular
adenopathy.
HEART: She has a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs,

or gallops.
LUNGS: Clear with decreased breath sounds anteriorly. She has a

midline sternal scar, which is healing by secondary intention.
ABDOMEN: She has no hepatosplenomegaly, no ascites.
EXTREMITIES: No peripheral edema.


Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
ECG Study Date of [**2159-2-14**] 2:40:38 AM
Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature beats. Compared to
tracing #1 frequency of atrial premature beats has significantly
increased.

[**2159-2-13**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Large region of post-obstructive
consolidation in the left lung with left hilar mass. Mild
pulmonary edema and a small right-sided pleural effusion are
seen, without overt congestive heart failure.
.
[**2159-2-13**] CTA OF THE CHEST: IMPRESSION:
1. No central or segmental pulmonary embolism.
2. Newly apparent marked lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum with
mass and/or lymphadenopathy in the left hilum, highly concerning
for a left hilar neoplasm with metastatic lymph nodes.
Endobronchial biopsy could be performed for further evaluation.
The infiltrate in the left lower lobe could represent post-
obstructive consolidation, given that the bronchial obstruction
of segmental lower lobe branches. Small amount of loculated left
pleural fluid.
3. Sternal non-[**Hospital1 **], with unchanged appearance of multiple
sternotomy wires, and pectoralis flap. No adjacent fluid
collections.
.
[**2159-2-14**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Normal head CT without and with
contrast without evidence of hemorrhage, or masses.
.
[**2159-2-14**] TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen
by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-12-25**],
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure are reduced. No residual
atrial septal defect flow identified.
.
[**2159-2-15**] CT ABDOMEN/ PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: IMPRESSION:
1. Indeterminate 1.4 cm lesion in segment [**Doctor First Name **] of the liver.
Differential includes a benign entity such as a hemangioma,
though hypervascular metastasis is an important consideration.
Further imaging with MR recommended.
2. Multiple scattered hypodense lesions in the liver, measuring
smaller than 9 mm. These are also indeterminate, though it could
potentially represent cysts or metastases. Further imaging
recommended.
3. Indeterminate 14 mm left adrenal nodule. Further evaluation
with MR recommended. Differential includes metastasis versus
benign adenoma. Further imaging with MR recommended.
4. Further partial collapse of the left lower lobe with
partially enhancing left pleural effusion.
5. 2 cm fluid collection at surgical site in right groin, likely
seroma, though infection (abscess) should be considered in
proper clinical setting.
5. Rectal distention with stool.
6. Multiple hypodense lesions in both kidneys, likely cysts.
Ultrasound (or MR) could evaluate this finding, though these
likely represent cysts.
.
[**2159-2-16**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-13**], there is
now almost complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
Although some of this may reflect pleural fluid, the shift of
the mediastinum to the left indicates that most of the
opacification relates to volume loss. The expanded right
hemithorax shows no evidence of acute pneumonia.
.
[**2159-2-16**] MRI ABDOMEN: IMPRESSION:
1. 16-mm enhancing lesion in segment IV-A of the liver along the
anterior liver margin. This lesion does not have characteristics
of a benign lesion. Additional small 7-mm segment IV-B lesion
along the anterior liver margin of similar enhancement
characteristics which could also represent metastases.
There are several additional foci which are too small to be
