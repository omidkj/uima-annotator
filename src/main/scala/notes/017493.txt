Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 18036**] had been admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with C. difficile
pancolitis from [**Date range (1) 31488**] and discharged home at that time
on PO vancomycin. She represented to the ED on [**12-25**] with
headache and weakness and decompensated, requiring intubation
and pressors. She was initially admitted to the MICU but then,
after consultation with ID, GI, Medicine, Surgery, and the MICU,
it was decided to take her to the operating room for total
abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy. She was kept intubated
for 4 days and extubated on [**12-29**], and transferred to the floor a
day later. She recovered on the floor slowly but surely and was
finally discharged home on [**2103-1-15**] to complete another 7 days of
flagyl. The rest of her stay is summarized below by system.

Neuro: In addition to her chronic back pain, Mrs. [**Known lastname 18036**] had
the addition of the new pain from the operation. She was started
on methadone standing and dilaudid prn and her pain control is
being given over to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **]. By the time of discharge,
her pain was well controlled on this regimen.

CV: Upon admission she required pressor support and significant
resuscitation for her sepsis, which continued after she went to
the OR. She was monitored in the ICU with a Swan-Ganz catheter
and was given fluids, blood products, derivatives, and pressors
as needed. She underwent echocardiography on [**12-28**] which showed a
LVEF of 70% and otherwise normal function except for new
moderate PA hypertension. Pressors were weaned appropriately and
she was able to be transferred to the floor where she remained
hemodynamically stable. Vital signs were monitored regularly.

Pulm: She was intubated in the ED and remained so until [**12-29**]
when she was finally weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
After extubation, she was weaned off oxygen appropriately and
left the hospital on room air.

GI/GU: She was quite surprised on awakening that she had a new
ostomy and this will require a long time for her to adjust. An
ostomy/wound care nursing consult was obtained and the ostomy
was changed regularly and monitored for signs of breakdown. By
the end of her hospital stay, Mrs. [**Known lastname 18036**] was becoming slowly
more comfortable managing her ostomy, but still required nursing
help. Due to the antibiotic received throughout her stay, she
began to develop a vaginal yeast infection which was treated
with fluconazole.

F/E/N: Electrolytes and fluids were monitore during her stay.
She received appropriate repletion when necessary. Tube feeds
were started on [**12-27**], but not continued for long. She was
started on TPN on [**12-28**] and continued on that until [**1-2**]. Her diet
was advanced appropriately to a bariatric stage V diet. She was
not taking in enough orally however to meet her needs, thus tube
feeds were started through her gastric remnant. The patient
complained of being stuck to the IV pole while getting tube
feeds and ultimately refused further feedings until it was
suggested that she take the tube feeds as boluses. The patient
learned how to do this herself and was ultimately much happier
with this arrangement, giving herself four cans of replete with
fiber daily. She was discharged home with qid tube feeds and a
regular diet.

Heme: The patient was coagulopathic upon presentation due to her
sepsis and required in total 6 units of packed RBCs, 6 units of
FFP, 2 cryoprecipitates, and 11 vials of albumin for repletion
of cofactors, treatment of her coagulopathy, anemia, and sepsis.
As she normalized following her operation, she no longer
required further products.

ID: The patient was put on PO vanc and IV flagyl on admission as
well as variably cefepime, zosyn, and tigecycline. After
discharge from the unit, the patient was maintained on
vancomycin and flagyl and eventually the vancomycin was dc'd.
Her flagyl was transitioned to po and she was discharged on a 7
day course of flagyl. Her wound started to show some breakdown
inferiorly and [**4-5**] staples were removed on [**1-6**] and a wound
culture sent. For this she was started on unasyn, which was
continued for a s
