Admission Date:  [**2131-6-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-6-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2075-9-18**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old female
with a past medical history of pulmonary sarcoidosis
diagnosed by chest CT and diabetes mellitus who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] with a left scapular and left arm pain since
1 a.m. on the day of admission.  The painful episode was
triggered by emotional stress and physical activity.  The
patient had a similar episode five days ago which resolved
spontaneously.  Patient was having 5/10 chest pain on
presentation.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 958**] denied chest pain, chest tightness,
no cough, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting upon
presentation.  The patient had no history of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea orthopnea.  In the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Room,
the patient had an anterior lateral lead ST elevation and CK
elevation minimally to 45.  Patient got oxygen, three 5 mg
doses of Lopressor, two 162 mg doses of aspirin and started
on heparin and nitrodrip.  The patient was then transferred
to [**Hospital6 256**] and taken to
catheterization laboratory.

Catheterization laboratory showed a normal left main with a
twin left anterior descending system with 50-60% ostial
proximal stenosis, 100% mid stenosis after D1, D1 diffuse 80%
proximal with distally graftable lumen, left circumflex
40-50% mid lesion before the large OM1 and mild luminal
irregularities in the right coronary artery with a 100%
distal mid after posterolateral branch with TIMI II flow.
The culprit left anterior descending lesion was Hepacoat
stented with 0% residual and TIMI III distal flow, proximal
ostial 60%.  Left anterior descending was not stented
secondary to ostial location involvement of D1.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Sarcoidosis, mild pulmonary involvement.
2.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus for 15 years.
3.  Blindness secondary to diabetic retinopathy.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and novocaine.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Accupril, Lopressor, Amaryl and
Glucophage.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her Emergency Room vitals:
Temperature 97.9.   Pulse is 97.  Respiratory rate 18.  Blood
pressure 196/110, saturating 98% on room air.  Physical
examination:  Alert and oriented times three in no acute
distress, lethargic, obese female.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat:  She had bilateral submandibular gland
enlargement.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact.  Oropharynx was clear.
She had a slight amount of dry blood was noticed on her lips
but there was no evidence of oral syringeal or tongue wax,
otherwise, she was normocephalic and atraumatic.  The patient
had thinning hair density in a symmetric pattern.  Her neck
exam:  There is no carotid bruit.  No thyromegaly.  No
lymphadenopathy.  No jugular venous pressure.  Her
cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops, normal S1, normal S2.  Possible S4 with distant
heart sounds.  Pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  No wheezes.  Abdominal exam:  Nontender,
positive active bowel sounds, obese, but not distended
abdomen.  Extremities:  Trace edema, 2+ posterior tibial
pulses bilaterally.  Skin exam:  Flank and extensor
dermatitis was noted.  Her pre catheterization pain free
electrocardiogram showed a regular rate and rhythm, ST
elevation in V1 to V6 without reciprocal changes in I and
aVL.  Her post catheterization electrocardiogram showed sinus
rhythm, left axis deviation, left anterior fascicular block,
anterior myocardial infarction based on Q waves development,
acute and recent.  Only difference from the previous tracing
were the ST changes were less prominent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascular:

A.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient's left anterior
descending was stented, however, the patient continued to
have a high risk coronary anatomy with persistent stenosis as
noted above.  The prospects of coronary artery bypass graft
were discussed with the patient to be done within four to six
weeks.  Patient was started on aspirin, Plavix times 30 days
and Integrilin times 18 hours, Lopressor, Lipitor and
captopril.  A heparin drip was initiated to prophylax for
potential left ventricular thrombus in the setting of an
anterolateral left ventricular wall infarct, however, the
patient was taken off heparin when it was determined that her
risks were low given the results of her echocardiogram,
status post catheterization, which showed reasonably good
ejection fraction and no apical akinesis or dyskinesis, just
hypokinesis, which could not significantly increase the risk
for left ventricular thrombus formation.

B.  Pump:  Echocardiogram was checked while the patient was
hospitalized after her catheterization.  The results showed a
mildly dilated left atrium, moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with left ventricular cavity size
being normal.  Overall, left ventricular systolic function
was mildly depressed with septal, distal, anterior and apical
hypokinesis.  There was mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.  The
patient's ejection fraction was estimated to be 40-45%.

C.  Rhythm:  The patient was normal sinus rhythm throughout
her hospitalization.  Electrocardiogram showed no rhythm
abnormalities and no evidence of arrhythmia throughout her
hospitalization.

2. Pulmonary:  The patient saturated well in the high 90s on
room air throughout her hospitalization.

3.  Renal:  The patient had no renal issues throughout her
hospitalization.  Her BUN and creatinine remained stable
despite a heavy dye load in the catheterization.  Intravenous
fluids were administered without dextrose per post
catheterization protocol to minimize the chance of dye
induced nephropathy.  The patient was given a cardiac and
diabetic diet throughout her hospitalization.  She was not
given her oral hypoglycemics and was covered with a sliding
scale insulin.  Patient was instructed to restart oral
hypoglycemic regimen after discharge.  We did not attenuate
her oral hypoglycemic regimen as this should be done on an
outpatient basis.

4.  Hematology:  Patient's hematocrit remained stable.  Post
catheterization, she was checked daily for evidence of
pseudoaneurysm or hematoma at the catheterization site.
Patient had no evidence of hematoma or pseudoaneurysm at the
catheterization site.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was seen by the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Service who spoke with her about potential
revascularization via coronary artery bypass grafting.  This
decision was agreed upon by all parties including Coronary
Care Unit Team and the Cardiothoracic Surgery Team.  The
Cardiothoracic Surgery Team was to contact the patient after
she was discharged to arrange surgery, which will be the best
long-term option for patient with significant coronary artery
disease with high risk anatomy in the setting of diabetes
mellitus.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged in good
condition and she was discharged home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Myocardial infarction.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
