Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**2100-8-16**].  He first underwent T1
through T3 laminectomy and transpedicular resection of T1 and T2
vertebral body tumor by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] on the 15th.  There were no
complications.  48 hours later, he underwent Right Thoracotomy
and upper lobectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Patient was extubated
following the thoracotomy, however he was reintubated on [**8-21**]
for respiratory failure and sent to the SICU.  CXR showed
consolidation - bronchoscopy and BAL were performed and patient
was found to be growing MRSA in sputum. Patient was then started
on vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia.

On [**8-22**], NGT output appeared to be coffee-ground in consistency
and color.  GI consult was obtained for GI bleed, as the
patient's HCT fell from 28 to 22.  The patient responded well to
a blood transfusion - GI recommended to follow the patient's HCT
levels serially, to obtain an EGD at some point, and to start
the patient on IV protonix.  EGD was performed on [**8-23**] and
showed erythema and congestion in the fundus, stomach body and
antrum compatible with erosive and gastritis.  Otherwise the EGD
was normal to the second part of the duodenum.

On [**8-22**], an inpatient neurology consult was also obtained for
the patient's history of epilepsy.  They made recommendations
regarding medications to be administrated to the patient while
he was NPO.

The patient remained in the ICU intubated on SIMV until [**8-30**].
He has broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and
zosyn through [**2101-9-1**] for persistent fevers and positive BAL
cultures.

On [**8-30**], the patient underwent PEG and tracheostomy placement.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was started on
Replete with Fiber tube feeds on [**8-31**], and was advanced to a
goal rate of 85 cc/hour by [**9-1**].  In terms of the tracheostomy,
he was able to be advanced to trach collar for an hour at a time
on [**9-1**], and was up to trach collar for 8 continuous hours. He
was downsized to a #6 cuffless and can be decannulated at rehab.
Speech and swallow evaluated him for PMV which he tolerated and
was able to independently clear his secretions.  He had a
bedside swallow evaluation followed by a video-swallow see
report.

He remained stable and was discharged to Shaugnessy-[**Hospital1 656**] and
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
