Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This 83 y/o woman with recent diagnosis of lung cancer after
dyspnea/hemoptysis 2wk ago in setting of LE DVT and recurrent
contralateral DVT w/ PE in spite of warfarin presents with left
sided weakness.

As per the patient's daughter with whom the patient lives (and
who provided English/[**First Name3 (LF) 595**] translation) the patient was in
USOH [**6-11**].  At midnight, her daughter came in her bedroom to
check on her and found her dosing and leaning to the left.  This
seemed unusual to her so she woke her mother and checked both
her grip strength which was equal.  Her mother only indicated
that she
felt tired and thus retired to bed.  At 0430h, her daughter had
awoken so again went to check on her mother, this time finding
her awake but collapsed on the floor with left sided weakness.
She called EMS whence the patient was brought to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ER, FSBS 133, SBP 140s.  Over the initial 45 minutes of
evaluation, her left sided weakness progressed from significant
drift to hemiplegia.  Her gaze progressed from mild to forced
right gaze deviation and her speech progressed from mild to
unintelligible dysarthria.  She was nonetheless hemodynamically
stable and able to protect her airway.

PRELIMINARY REPORT: Provided by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**], who indicated
"cutoff" in right middle cerebral artery (M1 segment); increased
mean transit time, decreased flow, equal volume compatible with
penumbra. Discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at 7:05 a.m.

FINDINGS: I concur with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18991**] observations. There is
obstruction of the right middle cerebral artery M1 segment
shortly after its origin. The discrepancy between blood volume
and mean transit times raises the question of an ischemic
penumbra. There was no sign for the presence of an intracranial
hemorrhage. Corresponding to the area of early ischemia is the
presence of a right-sided insular ribbon sign on the
conventional head CT images.

There is re-demonstration of the prominent left-sided cavernous
carotid and supraclinoid aneurysm, which has substantial
calcific components.

With regard to the angiography of the neck, neither common
carotid bifurcation exhibits hemodynamically significant
stenosis, although there was a markedly tortuous proximal right
internal carotid artery demonstrated. The vertebral arteries
appear to be non-stenotic.

CONCLUSION: Findings consistent with large area of prolonged
mean transit
time, but with a blood volume "mismatch" within virtually the
entire right middle cerebral artery territory. Obstruction of
the right middle cerebral artery at its M1 segment.

Brief Hospital Course:
83y [**Year/Month/Day 595**] speaking woman with a new diagnosis lung cancer,
HTN, HL, long h/o smoking, bilateral DVTs and recent PE while on
Coumadin, now on therapeutic Lovenox and s/p IVC filter p/w
right MCA occlusion and stroke.  Etiology most likely her
diffuse hypercoagulability related to her lung cancer.  She is
not a candidate for tPA as she currently on therapeutic Lovenox,
had recent hemoptysis due to lung cancer.  She is not a
candidate for MERCI clot retrieval because there is decreased
flow to the right anterior temporal lobe seen on perfusion
imaging.  Her diffuse
hypercoagulability with both Coumadin and more recently, Lovenox
represents a Trousseau-like syndrome. She was started on a
heparin drip with her goal PTTs between 50-70.

In rounds with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2168-6-13**], there was a discussion with
the patient's grand-daughter ([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 28334**]) regarding prognosis.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] explained that the prognosis was very poor due to her
multiple medical co morbidities. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 28334**] mentioned that she
wanted to have a discussion with her family. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 28334**]
mentioned that the DNI would be addressed once her family had
convened. Later that afternoon, they discussed palliative care
options with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 33234**].

On [**2168-6-15**] a morphine drip was started for comfort, and the
patient expired at 20:25h.
