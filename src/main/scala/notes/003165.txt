[**7-29**]: Head CT: 1. No acute hemorrhage or mass effect. 2.
Bifrontal lobe cerebral atrophy vs bifrontal higromas, follow-up
is recommended.  3. Old lacunar infarction.

MRI abd:
1. Full width full thickness tears of the supraspinatus and

tendons with tendon retraction and a high-riding humeral head.
Associated
marked muscular atrophy and fatty degeneration.
2. Complete tear of the long head of the biceps tendon.
3. Large joint effusion extending into the
subachromial-subdeltoid bursa and biceps tendon sheath with
evidence of synovitis. This could be inflammatory or infectious
in etiology.
4. Post-surgical changes of the AC joint.
5. Extensive degenerative cyst formation about the humeral head.

.
[**8-2**] CT abd:
1. Severely limited evaluation due to lack of IV and p.o.
contrast. No
evidence of dilated loops of bowel.
2. Extensive calcification of the aorta and its branches.
3. Hypodense lesions in the liver which are too small to
characterize.
4. Small amount of free fluid within the dependent portions of
the abdomen
and pelvis.

[**8-3**] echo:
IMPRESSION: Severe hypokinesis of the distal [**3-1**] of the left
ventricle. This could be consistent with stress cardiomyopathy
(Takotsubo syndrome) or multi-vessel coronary artery disease.
Diastolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate
to severe tricuspid regurgitation and at least moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
75yo woman w hx ? cardiomyopathy, CAD, HTN CRI here metabolic
acidosis, ? infection who ultimately died during hospital stay.
Brief hospital course:
.
Patient presented with metabolic acidosis thought [**2-29**] ARF vs
underlying infection.  She received fluid resuscitation in the
ICU with HCO3 and her metabolic acidosis improved.  She was seen
by renal and ID to assist with management.  Patient was treated
broadly for infectious sources and even had right shoulder tap.
Not clearly c/w septic joint however she remained on broad abx.
Patient had improvement in mental status and hemodynamics.
However, had several episodes of acute pulm edema on the floor
and echo c/w Takotsubo's syndrome.  Her SOB improved with lasix
but given the increased frequency of these episodes she was
transferred back to the ICU.
.
In the ICU, patient very clearly stated her interest in DNR DNI.
 We also confirmed this with her son, [**Name (NI) 47897**] (HCP).  We
initially tried to manage her acute systolic CHF with lasix and
nitro gtt but this was complicated by worsening renal
dysfunction and hypotension.  We were unable to give her IVF
given her pulmonary edema.  The patient became somewhat
delirious at this time.  We discussed her very poor clinical
picture with her HCP and he asked that we focus on comfort care.
 The patient was started on morphine and titrated to comfort.
At [**2144-8-5**] at 10:02am the patient was declared dead.  Causes of
death include: acute systolic CHF, ARF, and metabolic acidosis.
Family was at the bedside and declined autopsy.
