Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncopal Episode

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2166-1-16**]
1. Attempted Maze procedure with pulmonary vein isolation and
left atrial appendage resection.
2. Aortic valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve
(model number 21-AGFN-756).
3. Coronary artery bypass grafting x1, with reversed saphenous
vein graft to the posterior descending artery.

History of Present Illness:
55 year old male with a past medical history of coronary artery
disease (multiple PCI including RCA [**2158**], OM1 [**2160**], LCX [**2160**],
LAD [**2163**]), bicuspid aortic valve and moderate aortic stenosis
(TTE [**2163**] [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8-1.0cm2, cath [**2163**] gradient 29mm Hg and
calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.33 cm2), and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
not on coumadin due to bleeding risk, who presents from home
following syncopal episode. He reports, when leaving a friend's
house and walking to his car in the cold he developed sudden
onset substernal chest pain radiating to shoulder and left arm.
He drove home, 45 minutes away, and the chest pressure
persisted. He noticed that when he got home he felt very weak
trying to get a grocery bag out of his car. The chest pain
intensified as he walked from his car to the house. At his
house, he did not have enough energy to make it up the stairs
into his apartment on the [**Location (un) 1773**]. He felt lightheaded and
nauseous. He sat down on the third step of the stairs and then
lost consciousness and postural tone. He feels that he was down
for 10 minutes. After the event he felt "out of it," weak, and
had difficulty calling EMS for assistance. He continued to have
chest pain. EMS arrived and he was given aspirin 325mg and EKG
showed Afib w/ RVR w/ rate of 150s, so was given 20 IV diltiazem
with improvement initially of rate to 120s.  He notes that his
angina (0.5 miles) and syncopal episodes have increased in
frequency over the past few months.  He also notes that he has
never had syncope at rest, and that is always with exertion and
associated with feeling fatigue and weakness prior. He is now
being referred to cardiac surgery for evaluation on Aortic valve
replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**1-16**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results on [**Known lastname 1349**] before bypass.
POST-BYPASS: Normal RV systolic function. LVEF 40%. There is a
mechanical prosthesis in the native aortic position, seated and
functioning well with a residual mean gradient of 11 mm of Hg.
Intact thoraic aorta. Wall motion abnormalities and other
valvular findings similar to prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1349**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up during previous admission. On [**1-16**] he was brought
directly to the operating room where he underwent an aortic
valve replacement, coronary artery bypass graft x 1, and MAZE
procedure. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Later that day he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Beta
blockers and diuretics were initiated and he was gently diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day one he was transferred
to the step-down floor for further care. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. During his
post-op course he worked with physical therapy for strength and
mobility.  He developed post-op atrial fibrillation which
converted to sinus rhythm with lopressor and amiodarone.  He is
anti-coagulated for his mechanical aortic valve.  INR did rise
to 5.4 following three doses of warfarin 5mg.  Warfarin was held
and INR trended back into goal range of 2.5-3.5.  His PCP will
manage coumadin/INR on discharge.  The patient was discharged
home with VNA on POD 7.  All follow up is advised.
