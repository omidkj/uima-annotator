Pertinent Results:
Cardiac cath ([**2199-12-12**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed three vessel disease. The LMCA was a short, ectatic
vessel with no apparent flow-limiting lesions. The proximal LAD
was mildly calcified with a tubular 60% stenosis. There was nild
diffuse disease in the remainder of the LAD. The LCX had an
eccentric 80-90% stenosis at its origin and was mildly diffusely
diseased for the rest of its course. OM1 had mild diffuse
disease and a 60% stenosis at its origin. The dominant RCA had
an 80% stenosis in its proximal segment, a 90% stenosis in its
mid segment, and a 90% stenosis in its distal segment prior to
the crux. There was TIMI 2 flow into a PDA with mild diffuse
disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left
sided filling pressures (LVEDP 35 mmHg).


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-12-12**] for further
management of his worsening shortness of breath. He was taken to
the catheterization lab where he was found to have a short
calcified left main coronary artery, 70% stenosed proximal left
anterior descending artery, and a 60% stenosed dominant proximal
right coronary artery and a distal 90% stenosis of the same
artery, his left circumflex artery had a 90% eccentric lesion.
Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical service
was consulted for surgical revascularization. He was worked-up
in the usual preoperative manner.  On [**2199-12-13**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
taken to the operating room. CABG was performed, LIMA to LAD,
SVG to OM, SVG to PDA.  He was on Cardiopulmonary bypass for 67
minutes and cross clamped for 52 minutes.  Postoperatively he
was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day (POD) one, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. On POD 2 His pressors
were weaned and he was transferred to the cardiac stepdown unit.
 Beta blockade, plavix, coumadin thromboembolism prophylaxis,
and aspirin were resumed. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. On POD 3 chest tubes, and epicardial wires
were removed.  The physical therapy service was consulted to
assist him with postoperative strength and mobility. His oxygen
saturations improved to 100% on room air.  Social work was
consulted regarding assessment of needs and availability of
verteran resources after discharge to assist with psychosocial
issues.  Case management was consulted regarding placement of
Mr. [**Known lastname **] in a Veterans homeless shelter due to domestic issues
with his spouse.  [**Name (NI) **] was discharged with an INR of 2.6 after
Coumadin 7.5mg for four daily doses.  His INR and coumadin
dosage will be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15069**], PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 269**]
arrangements were made for drawing his INR on [**2198-12-20**] and results
to be called in to the PCP.  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Known lastname **] was discharged to home in
good condition on POD 6 with sternal precautions,
cardiac/diabetic diet, and follow up with his PCP and
cardiologist in [**12-16**] weeks.
