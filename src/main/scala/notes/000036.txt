History of Present Illness:
78 yo man c PMH of Chronic Liver disease, Hepatoma s/p
[**First Name3 (LF) 54267**] x 2, COPD, Afib on coumadin, was in his USOH until
[**2153-2-3**] AM when he began having chills, rigors and was febrile
at home to 101, per pt.  He went to [**Location (un) **] ED were he was found
to be hypotensive BP in low 70 s. Pt denies having: cough, SOB,
dysuria, urinary frequency, diarrhea, abdominal pain, n/v, night
sweats, anorexia. Last BM was yesterday. At [**Location (un) **]: Levaquin, 3
L NS, dopamine 5 mcg/min. Pt arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] ED c BP in near
120/48 HR 80-90s. Dopamine drip was stopped.  However pt was
noticed to have refractory hypotension and started on Levophed
again.  In the [**Hospital1 **] ED, he received IV Vanco, Levoflox, FFP and
NS IVF at 100cc/hour.
.
His MICU course: The pt was on vanc, levo, flagyl in the unit.
Panculture negative to date. CXR without infiltrates. Abd u/s
negative for cholecystitis. Abdominal CT to r/o new liver
abscess considering pt's PMH was negative.  Vancomycin was
tapered off [**2-6**] (received 4 days).  IV levoflox and flagyl were
continued.  Pt was also on steroids for bronchospasm, COPD in
MICU, and received prednisone 60mg po qd in the unit, with
bronchodilators.  He is satting 99-100% on 2L NC (his baseline
oxygen requirement).  Initially, his INR was supratherapeutic to
4.9, so coumadin was held initially.  Coumadin was restarted for
goal INR [**1-12**].  His foley was d/c'd and he continues to urinate
well. He is tolerating a regular diet, taking all meds orally.

[**2153-2-3**]: CXR IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with congestive heart
failure.Bibasilar atelectasis with small bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
[**2153-2-4**]: Abdominal Ultrasound
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cholecystitis or
cholelithiasis. Patchy areas of increased echogenicity in the
right lobe of the liver likely representing changes associated
with prior RF ablation.
.
[**2153-2-5**] CT TORSO
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral predominantly peripheral ground glass opacities,
which are new from the prior study. The etiology is uncertain,
but differential diagnosis includes includes infectious or
inflammatory process, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia,
eosinophilic or hypersensitivity pneumonia and pulmonary edema
superimposed on severe emphysema. Clinical correlation and
follow up if indicated is recommended.
2. Stable renal cysts.
3. Stable appearance of the radiofrequency ablations site. No
evidence of abdominal abscess or pseudocyst.
4. Peripheral high attenuation area transiently seen ?perfusion
anomaly, as described.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo man with Chronic Liver disease, Hepatoma s/p [**Month/Day (1) 54267**]
x 2, h/o liver abscess, COPD, Atrial fibrillation on coumadin
admitted for fever and hypotension, thought to be septic
secondary to unclear etiology-- CXR negative for infiltrate but
with bilateral pleural effusions (effusions too small for a
diagnostic thoracentesis), Urinalysis negative, urine cx
negative, blood cx X 4 negative.  Pt covered empirically X 4
days on Vanco/Levo/Flagyl, d/c Vanco [**2153-2-6**], and continued
Levo/Flagyl to complete 7 day course given history of liver
abscess in past.
.
1.  Hypotension, Fever on admission thought to be [**1-11**]
Septic-picture:  with no clear source.  However low BP,
documented fever at OSH, and hx of chills makes infection
likely. Pt started on Levofloxacin + Vanc in ED and on Levophed
trough peripheral IV. On vanc, levo, flagyl in the MICU.
Panculture negative to date. CXR without infiltrates. Abd u/s
negative for cholecystitis.  CT torso showing ground glass
opacities in lungs inflamm vs. infectious, bilateral effusions
too small to tap.  No intraabd abscess.
-  Plan to continue Levo/Flagyl for 2 more days to complete 7
day course given h/o liver abscess in past.
.
2.  Cardiovascular:
A. Coronaries: No signs of ischemia on EKG, enzymes negative.
Aspirin was held and his beta blocker was continued.
B. Pump:  No signs of ischemia on EKG or enzymes.  Getting 20mg
IV lasix for diuresis, transitioned to 40mg po lasix on transfer
to medical floor.  Of note, he usually gets 80mg po qd of lasix
at home.  Last echo was [**6-13**] showing EF 55%, severe pulm a HTN,
dil atria b/l, dilated right ventricle with pressure overload.
On discharge, he is monitor his daily weight and call his PCP if
his weight increases by 3 lbs or more, as this may indicate
heart failure.
C. Rhythm: Atrial fibrillation.  He is to continue his beta
blocker, atenolol, for rate control, and coumadin for
