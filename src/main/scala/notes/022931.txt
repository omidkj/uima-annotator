Pertinent Results:
ech0 [**2175-9-14**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. The left ventricular ejection fraction is normal.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is
present. There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve
leaflets. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2175-9-13**], the heart rate is lower and there is
significantly less left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Systolic anterior motion of the mitral leaflets remains.
Moderate [**Last Name (un) 22837**] and tricuspid regurgitation are now seen.

He awoke neurologically intact and was weaned and extubated.
Post -op echo revealed 2+MR and 2+TR. He was hypertensive
post-operatively requiring neo and nitro drips for BP control.

[**Last Name (un) **] and hydralazine were added and titrated to maintain SBP<120.
His Chest tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed per
protocol. He was transferred from the ICU to the step down unit.
He was agressively diuresed and at the time of discharge
continues to require agressive diuresis for persistant lower
extremity edema. He was evaluated by physical therapy for
strength an dconditioning and cleared for discharge to home on
