.
ECG: sinus, 98bpm, normal axis, TWI II/III/aVF
.
CXR: Detail limited secondary to obscuration by overlying trauma

board.  Endotracheal tube in good position.  NG tube probably in
good position as well.  No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
disease.
.
CT head: Global loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation in bilateral
cerebral hemispheres with diffuse hypodense appearance, most
likely representing cerebral edema in this patient with cardiac
arrest.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
46M h/o DM1, ESRD found unresponsive at home in asystole.
.
# s/p cardiac arrest: Found down in asystole for unclear
duration. Unclear cause, but differential included arrythmia,
infection, MI, PE, arrythmia. Cardiac enzymes were elevated but
as the patient did receive shocks in the field this was a more
likely explanation. Tox screen was positive for cocaine so an
arrythmogenic or ischemic event may have been precipitated by
substance abuse [**1-22**] vasospasm. Based on exam and CT head, there
was likely significant anoxic brain injury (see below). Labs
were notable for post-arrest hypokalemia which suggested the
possible presence of a significant hypokalemia post-HD. He was
continued on ASA, but beta-blockers were held given recent
hypotension, arrest, cocaine use. Echocardiogram revealed global
HK likely due to stunning [**1-22**] arrest but no vegetations.
Infectious sources were treated (see below). Hypothermia was not
performed given the prolonged duration prior to presentation
(unclear duration down, first presented to OSH then med-flight
to [**Hospital1 18**] prior to our evaluation).
.
# Respiratory failure: [**1-22**] arrest. No acute process on CXR
initially but then developed left-sided infiltrate likely due to
aspiration event peri-arrest. He was started on levo/flayl for
CAP. Trials of PSV were attempted but unsuccessful.
.
# ?Seizures: Noted to have rhythmic eye and face/upper extremity
movements at presentation. Initially dilantin loaded but then
dilantin stopped per neuro as EEG without cortical seizure
activity.
.
# ID: Infiltrate on CXR likely aspiration and treated with
levoflox/flagyl. Also with 5/6 bottles positive for GPC in
clusters and started on vancomycin; source may have been HD
line. Mildly elevated WBC count but afebrile.
.
# Hypotension: Resolved. Likely [**1-22**] sedatives and vagal
stimulation during intubation vs. sepsis. At present, off
dopamine gtt and maintaining good BPs but became hypotensive
again during dilantin loading that resolved with IV fluids.
.
# ESRD: HD held until goals of care established (see below).
Continued renagel. There was no acute HD need.
.
# DM1: Hypoglycemic initially, then improved. Continued HISS.
Held NPH for now.
.
# ?GI bleed: h/o severe esophagitis and upper GI bleeding.
Bright red blood noted return from OG tube but Hct remained
relatively stable.
.
# Anoxic brain injury: Loss of grey-white junction on CT head
and pronounced deficits on exam suggest significant injury.
Neurology was consulted and, after 72 hours without improvement,
delivered grim prognosis for any significant recovery. At family
meeting it was decided that to make the patient CMO based on his
wishes. The ETT was removed and the patient rapidly expired.
