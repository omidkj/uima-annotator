Admission Date: [**2193-4-16**]        Discharge Date: [**2193-4-21**]

Date of Birth:  [**2193-4-16**]        Sex:  M

Service:  Neonatology


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Doctor Last Name **] is a full term baby boy
delivered on [**2193-4-16**], due to a history of fetal ascites
on prenatal ultrasound. His mother is 40 years old. She is a
gravida IV, para II, now [**Name (NI) 1105**] mother. Prenatal screens are
blood type A positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR
nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and group
B Strep status unknown.

PRENATAL HISTORY:  On [**2192-12-4**], a normal fetal
survey was noted. CF negative. Declined amniocentesis. One
week prior to delivery, an ultrasound to assess size revealed
an AFI of 18, no other concerns. An ultrasound on the day of
delivery revealed polyhydramnios with an AFI of 24 and a
fetus with abdominal ascites. Monitoring revealed a
nonreassuring fetal heart tracing and so a cesarean section
was performed for fetal concerns and a previous cesarean
section in this mother. Rupture of membranes occurred at the
time of delivery. The infant emerged with good color,
spontaneous cry. Examination was notable for abdominal
distention and firmness. The infant urinated in the delivery
room. The Apgar was 8 at 1 minute and 8 at 5 minutes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, in general,
the baby was quiet in no apparent distress, had mild
tachypnea, abdominal distention, and was nondysmorphic. Anterior
fontanelle open and flat. Lungs clear to
auscultation and equal. Cardiovascular - Regular rate and
rhythm, +1 to +2 systolic murmur,
+2 femoral pulses. Pale, pink with good perfusion. Abdomen
full, distended, positive bowel sounds. GU - normal male,
testes down bilaterally. Patent anus. Had not yet passed
meconium. Extremities - Moves all equally, no sacral
abnormalities. Stable hips. Physical examination also
includes a birth weight of 3210 grams, 30th percentile, head
circumference 34.5 centimeters, 30th percentile, length 48
centimeters, 30th percentile.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular - Initially, the baby was
cardiovascularly stable with heart rate 140 to 160, blood
pressure 66/38, average mean blood pressure ranged from 44 to 55.
Heart size was normal on the initial chest x-ray. Chest x-ray
also notable for pleural effusions, abdominal ascites.
Because of the persistent murmur on examination, on [**2193-4-18**], cardiology was consulted and an echocardiogram was
performed which revealed a moderate to large PDA with most
velocity in left to right flow. The left aortic arch showed
normal branching, there was mild tricuspid regurgitation, right
ventricular pressure greater than half left ventricular pressure,
right ventricular hypertrophy but with qualitatively good
biventricular systolic function. The baby has not had any
pressor requirements to this point. Access is via a double
lumen UVC line which is positioned in the IVC junction of the
right atrium.

Respiratory - Initially, the baby was noted to have mild
tachypnea with increasing work of breathing, was placed on a
nasal cannula O2 on day of life #1 with respiratory rates 40s
to 90s. On day of life #2 required CPAP to maintain
comfortable breathing pattern. Previous blood gas at that
time revealed a pH of 7.24, CO2 of 31, paO2 70, base deficit
of minus 12. The baby received sodium bicarbonate bolus at
this time for a persistent metabolic acidosis. Over the next
24 hours into day of life #3, increased work of breathing
necessitating intubation and SIMV. With pressures PIP 26,
PEEP 6, rate of 25 and 40% oxygen, venous blood gas reveals
pH 7.30, CO2 of 52, with a base excess of minus 1. At that
point continued to require sodium bicarbonate and drip was
started at 1 mEq/kilogram which was reduced to 0.5
mEq/kilogram over the course of that day, day of life #3. The
sodium bicarbonate drip was stopped on the morning of [**2193-4-20**]. The baby was placed on hi-fi oscillating ventilation
at that time as well with a mean airway pressure of 17 and a
delta P of 40 to 42 and 40% to 60% with oxygen venous blood
gas of pH 7.24, CO2 of 66. There were blood tinged secretions
noted from the endotracheal tube at this time as well.
Currently, the baby remains intubated and is on hi-fi
ventilation, currently has a mean airway pressure of 17, a
delta P of 40, a hertz of 12, FIO2 ranges between 35% and
40%. Endotracheal tube is a 3.5 taped at 9.5 centimeters.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The baby has been
maintained NPO, initially started on fluids of 60 cc/kilogram
with D10W. Initial Dextrostix was 50, dropped to 38 requiring
D10 bolus. Over the course of the next 3 days, had increasing
glucose requirement with serum glucose 31, was changed over
to D12.5 and then D15, currently is on D25, providing a GIR
of 10.3 mg/kilogram/minute. His current solution is D25 with
6 mEq/100ml of potassium acetate in 1 port and 6 mEq/100ml of
potassium chloride in the secondary port, potassium chloride is
at 50 cc/kilogram and the potassium acetate is at 30 cc/kilogram
in response to serial serum electrolytes. The GIR of 10.3 has
given the baby most recent glucose of 126 on the morning of
[**2193-4-21**]. Most recent electrolytes the morning of [**2193-4-21**], a serum sodium of 152, potassium 4.0, chloride 90,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 37, creatinine 0.6. Urine output has been
3.1 cc/kilogram per hour which has dropped to 1.2 cc/kilogram
per hour over the last 10 to 12 hours. Total fluids were
liberalized today on [**2193-4-20**], from 60 cc/kilogram per
day to 80 cc/kilogram per day. The baby received 1 dose of
Lasix in the early morning of [**2193-4-21**], with no
apparent increase in urine output. A Foley catheter is being
placed at this time to more closely monitor urine output.
Weight is currently up 10% from birth weight at 3.53. Last
weight was obtained on [**2193-4-19**]. The baby has not been
weighed secondary to severity of illness in the last 48
hours.

GI - Initial LFTs were obtained due to marked
hepatosplenomegaly and ascites noted at the time of delivery.
Initial LFTs revealed an ALT of 105, AST of 379, alkaline
phosphatase of 126, bilirubin 4.5 over direct of 1.4. Serial
liver function tests revealed an increasing ALT and AST with
the most recent values peaked on [**2193-4-20**], with an ALT
of 1147, AST 3379, alkaline phosphatase 125, bilirubin of
17.6 over a direct of 12.8. On the morning of [**2193-4-21**],
the ALT is 754, and the AST is 1772, alkaline phosphatase
115, bilirubin 20.2 total over a direct of 13.8 this morning
[**2193-4-21**]. Abdominal ultrasound was obtained on [**2193-4-18**], which revealed ascites, a small pleural effusion,
normal kidneys were noted, and abnormal hydrops of
gallbladder was also noted. Surgery was consulted initially
to rule out a GI obstruction and this was ruled out on the
day of admission. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 37079**] has been placed to drain gastric
secretions and this has been draining some blood tinged
secretions as well and the infant is on IV Zantac. A GI
consultation was obtained due to the hepatosplenomegaly,
abnormal coagulation studies and thrombocytopenia. Hepatitis
felt to be due to an infectious process and metabolic workup
was also initiated at this time. There has been no current
treatment for the direct hyperbilirubinemia.

Hematology - Initial CBC revealed a white count of 5.6 with
13 polys and 3 bands for an ANC of 896, hematocrit 38%,
platelet count 22,000. A repeat platelet count was 28,000.
The baby received 10 cc/kilogram of platelets shortly after
admission. Repeat platelet count was 9,000. All told, the
infant has had 7 platelet transfusions, currently receiving
platelets at the time of dictation. Most recent platelet
count is 55,000 this morning at 2:00 a.m. on [**2193-4-21**].
The baby has also had 3 packed red blood cell transfusions
and received fresh frozen plasma x2 for a fibrinogen of 100.
Coagulation studies in addition to that revealed a PT and PTT
of 24.6 and 77 on [**2193-4-16**], again on [**2193-4-19**], and
[**2193-4-20**], PT of 20.1 with a PTT of 63.8. Additional
coagulation studies have been requested for
