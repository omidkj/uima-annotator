History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 yo male with significant cardiac hx with CABG x 2,
who was recently discharged [**2125-2-2**] for a re-stent to his
SVG-LAD.  He presents this time with urinary frequency and pain
on urination ever since his foley was discontinued from that
prior admission.  He does not have h/o prostate disease, urinary
frequency or dysuria.  He denies fever or chills and does not
have hematuria.
.
His PSA was 1.0 on 8/[**2123**].
.
In the ED, his vitals were 98.6, 87, 168/60, 20, 98%RA.  His
prostate on exam was enlarged but non-tender.  UA was positive
for UTI.  Urology was consulted and a foley was placed with
difficulty but only a small volume (not documented) came out.
Per Urology, he had low post-void residual.  He was given Cipro
500mg x 1 and sent to medicine for further care.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:

IMPRESSION: Unchanged radiograph from previous. Mild vascular
congestion..
.
 ECHO Study Date of [**2125-2-6**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is  moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic  dysfunction
with extensive akinesis of the anterior, lateral, and apical
left  ventricle and hypokinesis of the inferior wall and septum.
The basal inferior  and inferolateral walls contract best. A
left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot  be excluded due to
extensive apical trabeculations. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic  valve leaflets cannot
be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No  aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.  An eccentric jet of moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left  ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with  elevated left
atrial pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-1-11**],
the severity of  mitral regurgitation may have increased
slightly. Otherwise, the findings are  similar.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2125-2-8**] 2:20 PM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either
lower extremity.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2125-2-8**] 8:11 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased pulmonary vascular engorgement, particularly
prominent on the right, could be indicative of pulmonary
embolism.
2. Airspace opacity in the right lower lobe could represent
evolving pulmonary infarction or an area of aspiration.
3. Interval development of mild pulmonary edema.
4. Gaseous distention of the stomach.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2125-2-9**] 9:06 AM
IMPRESSION:
Worsening of pulmonary edema. No sizeable pleural effusion.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2125-2-10**] 4:46 AM
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema unchanged.
Unchanged retrocardiac density. New opacity projecting over the
left mid lung zone.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2125-2-11**] 7:20 AM
IMPRESSION: Worsening fluid overload and question focal
infiltrate on the right.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo male with CAD recently discharged on [**2-2**] s/p stent to
SVG-PDA p/w urinary retention.
.
1. CAD: The patient has h/o CABG with multiple stents, recently
to SVG-LAD on [**2125-2-2**].  His EKG on this admission does not show
any ST-T changes consistent with ischemia compared to previous
ones on [**2125-2-1**] and [**2125-2-2**].  His troponins were elevated to 0.79
but are trending down since last admission, probably from cath
procedure.  The CK portion is normal so that is reassuring.
From ED signout, cardiology was called in ED and they were not
concerned for ACS.  Enzymes were cycled and were negative.
Patient was continued on ASA, metoprolol, isosorbide &
lisinopril (later switched to hydral to protect his kidneys).
While on the floor the patient experienced a CODE BLUE at which
time he was found to be in Vfib, was cardioverted once, reverted
to nsr, and sent to the CCU for monitoring.  He was briefly
intubated and on pressors, both of which were weaned promptly.
The patient did well on the floor, and was given an BIV pacer
ICD placed by EP.  He will follow up with EP for his pacer check
and have a repeat Echo on [**2-21**].
.
2. CHF: The patient had an echo revealing an EF of 20%.  He was
on lasix 40mg PO bid and hydrocholorothizide 25 daily before the
last admission but these were discontinued after recent cath.
He seemed volume overloaded causing SOB.  CXR consistent with
unchanged pulmonary edema and lungs with mild crackles.  He was
diuresed with good result and given his low EF, recent code, he
had an ICD placed on [**2125-2-14**] without event.  He will have to
follow-up in device clinic after discharge, and continue his
lasix.
.
3. Ventricular fibrillation:  Patient was admitted to CCU after
CODE BLUE for Ventricular fibrillation.  He was cardioverted and
reverted to nsr.  Since this episode he was placed with an ICD,
and will follow-up with the clinic as an outpatient.
.
4. Inflammatory urinary o
