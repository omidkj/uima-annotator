Admission Date:  [**2108-10-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2108-11-6**]


Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82 year-old
female with two to three week history of worsening exertional
chest pain.  The patient describes it as throbbing and
radioing to her left arm.  The pain is associated with
shortness of breath, nausea and dizziness.  The patient was
admitted to [**Hospital3 3834**] for monitoring and was started
on a nitroglycerin drip.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs heart rate 68 to 70, blood
pressure 198/74, 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2 are
normal. No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Neck no JVD.  No
carotid bruits bilaterally.  Pulmonary, lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen obese, soft, positive
bowel sounds in all four quadrants.  Vasculature, 3+ femoral
pulses, positive dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial
pulses bilaterally with trace pedal edema.

LABORATORY:  Hematocrit 39.0, creatinine 0.9, PT 12.3, INR
1.1.  Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 62,
normal intervals, isolated T wave flattening in AVL.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2108-10-31**].  Cardiac catheterization
was performed on that day, which showed LMCA 80% distal
stenosis, left anterior descending coronary artery 80%
proximal, 90% mid, 80% distal involving D2 stenosis, LCX
subtotally occluded, right coronary artery 80% proximal, 80%
distal, 80% proximal posterior descending coronary artery and
60% mid posterior descending coronary artery occluded.  The
patient's left ventricular and diastolic pressure equals 18.
At that time it was decided that the patient's coronary
artery disease was amenable to coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2108-11-2**] and
a four vessel coronary artery bypass graft was performed.
The left internal mammary coronary artery was brought to the
left anterior, reverse saphenous vein was brought to the
diagonal, reverse saphenous vein graft was brought to the
obtuse marginal and reverse saphenous vein graft was brought
to the posterior descending coronary artery.  The patient
received medical management postoperatively two doses and was
subsequently transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care
Unit unit where she did very well and was able to be
transferred to the floor on postoperative day two where she
continued to be diuresed and to do quite well in terms of her
oxygenation.  Postoperative day three the patient's Lopressor
dose was increased secondary to increased heart rate and on
postoperative day number four the patient was discharged to
rehab in excellent condition.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft times four.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopresor 50 mg po b.i.d., Lasix 40 mg
po b.i.d. times fourteen days, K-Dur 20 milliequivalents po
b.i.d., Percocet one to two tabs q 4 to 6 hours po prn severe
pain, aspirin 325 mg po q day, Zantac 150 mg po b.i.d.,
Colace 100 mg po b.i.d.
