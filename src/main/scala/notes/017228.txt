hematoma or hygroma. No evidence of acute intracranial
pathology.

CXR ([**2124-6-4**]): Right lower lobe pneumonia and probable left
lower lobe pneumonia. Background mild pulmonary edema.

involving the right upper extremity.

tracing available for comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. GIB:
GI was consulted and took the patient for EGD which showed 2
duodenal ulcers.   She received 4 units pRBC in first 24 hours
with appropriate increase in her hct from 17 --> 26.  Iron
studies were consistent with AOCD despite her history of iron
deficiency anemia.  She was placed on a PPI due to her EGD.  An
h.pylori antibody was sent which was positive; eradication
therapy was begun on [**6-11**].

She had an additional drop in her hematocrit 1 day after her
EGD, and she was transfused an additional 2u pRBC.  She was
taken for another EGD on [**6-8**] which showed stable non-bleeding
duodenal ulcer.  Thereafter her hematocrit was stable with a
discharge value of 25.3%

2. Pneumonia:
Initially presented with leukocytosis.  CXR revealed RLL
infiltrate which was suspicious for a pneumonia.  She was
treated with 1 week of levofloxacin 250mg; the course was
completed on [**6-12**].

3. Demential/Delerium:
Prior discharge summary from [**Hospital1 2177**] documented known dementia.  She
appeared to have fairly advanced dementia and was not oriented
to her surroundings or to time.  A head CT showed a chronic SDH
vs. hygroma with no active issue.  She was started on standing
haldol with olanzapine PRN; a sitter was used in the ICU but was
not needed towards the end of the patient's floor stay.

4. Renal failure:
Cr baseline in the 2s per a discharge summary from [**Hospital1 2177**].  SCr
fluctuated during the stay.  Urine output remained >600cc/day,
but the patient needed reminders to continue taking PO.  She
will likey need outpatient renal follow-up for EPO therapy,
vitamin D, calcium and phos monitoring and for possible
discussions of dialysis given that she has stage V CKD.
