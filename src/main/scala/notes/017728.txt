History of Present Illness:
59 y/o man with a history of AML diagnosed [**1-21**] s/p 7+3
induction on [**2175-2-4**] with persistent blasts w/o maturation in
repeat marrow bx, s/p reinduction with HIDAC on [**2176-3-2**], now day
#215 s/p allo stem cell transplant (HLA matched sibling-brother)
in [**7-20**], presents with a 3.5 week h/o diarrhea.  The pt states
the diarrhea began [**3-10**], with watery brown semi-solid to solid
BMs, up to 10-12 per day.  He felt that he occasionally could
not make it to the bathroom.  No blood or mucus in the stool.
He tried to limit his lactose intake, but this did not improve
his diarrhea.  He has not had any sick contacts, foreign travel
(only recently went to [**Location (un) 7349**]), no camping. No changes in
medications or new antibiotics recently.  He did have a "skin
rash" recently at [**Hospital **] Hospital, thought [**1-18**] levaquin.  The
pt was hospitalized [**Date range (1) 61436**] at [**Location (un) **], and stated that he was
given IVF hydration, stool studies sent, he underwent flex
sigmoidoscopy showing "rectal ulcers" that were biopsied, with
path pending per pt.  He says their workup was "unrevealing."
During his hospitalization, he was given flagyl and levaquin,
and hydrocortisone.  His diarrhea has continued despite these
measures.  He has no abd pain, no nausea or vomiting. + low
grade fevers but  chills. No dark urine.  No night sweats. He
notes a 13 lb weight loss since [**2-29**].  Decreased energy. Poor po
intake (b/c he fears that it will 'go right through him.'
Eating boost tid, with soups mainly.  + bloating, and the
sensation of "having to have a bm" that can be as severe as a
[**5-25**], but is usually a [**1-26**].  He has not taken any meds for the
bloating or diarrhea until recently, when Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] told him to
take Imodium.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
#. [**1-21**]: Initial presentation of malignancy:  Pt had a routine
physcial at his PCP's office that showed pancytopenia. His last
CBC was one year earlier and WNL. He was admitted to [**Hospital **]
hospital where a bone marrow showed acute myelogenous leukemia.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] for further treatment.
Prior to seeing his PCP he felt completely well. He had not
noticed any bleeding, fevers, chills, night sweats, HA, weight
loss, or shortness of breath.
.
#. AML - Hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**]: [**Date range (1) 61437**]: Initial bone
marrow biopsy showed marrow involvement by AML evolving in a
background of myelodysplastic syndrome. 90% blasts were seen on
aspirate. Cytogenetics were abnormal with multiple structural
and numerical aberrations. Among these are a missing 7 and 21, a
deletion of 5q, additional material of undetermined origin on
17q, and 4 to 5 structurally abnormal markers. The patient was
started on 7+3 therapy on [**2-4**]. He tolerated the induction well
with only the development of fevers. However on day +13 of
induction, he underwent repeat bone marrow which demonstrated
persistent leukemia. A repeat marrow on day +20 showed a
hypocellular marrow with young cells that were thought to be of
normal maturation. His peripheral smear demonstrated few blasts,
also thought to represent early cells of normal maturation. His
peripheral smear continued to show blasts and on day +28, his
marrow was re-biopsied. This showed a increase in the number of
blast forms without maturation. He underwent reinduction with
HIDAC starting [**2175-3-3**]. He had no mucositis or CNS dysfunction
His repeat marrow on day +14 of re-induction showed 95% cellular

bone marrow comprised almost exclusively of immature cells,
consistent with myeloblasts. His counts were monitored closely
to see if he would return with MDS or persistent AML. As his
counts began to return he had noted 10% blasts in the periphery.
It was felt that this could represent persistent AML versus
early recovering marrow.  He also developed a PNA during this
admission.

ORIGINAL CYTOGENETICS:

This abnormal karyotype shows multiple structural and numerical
aberrations. Among these are a missing 7 and 21, a deletion of
5q, additional material of undetermined origin on 17q, and 4 to
5 structurally abnormal marker

Pertinent Results:
MARROWS DURING INTITIAL DX:
#. [**2175-2-22**] BM Bx: Cellular myeloid-dominant marrow with markedly
left-shifted myelopoiesis and increased myeloblasts (day 20
status post myeloblative chemotherapy) Note: Although
myeloblasts appear increased on the hemodilute aspirate smear,
an accurate count can not be determined due to poor specimen
quality. Re-biopsy is recommended if clinically indicated.

fragments of > 95% cellular bone marrow comprised almost
exclusively of immature cells, consistent with myeloblasts.
