Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity. Severe regional LV
systolic dysfunction. Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate AS (AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2) Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: No MVP. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
consistent with severe 3 vessel coronary artery diseae and with
EF 20%. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Post_Bypass:
Patient is on infusion of epinephrine, milrinone and levophed.
Normal RV systolic function.
There is mild improvement of previous severely hypokinetic
segments of the LV with anEF of 20 to 25%.
There is moderate MR>
Thoracic aortic contour is intact.
There is a bioprosthesis in the native aortic position, well
seated and stable with a peak of 12 and a mean of 6mm at a
cardiac output of 6L/min


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**12-5**] where he underwent a
CABG x 3 and AVR (tissue). He was tarnsferred to the ICU in
critical but stable condition on epinephrine, levophed,
milrinone, and propofol. Postoperatively he was seen by urology
for scrotal masses. He was extubated on POD #1. His vasoactive
drips were weaned on POD #2 and he was transferred to the floor
on POD #3. He has several episodes of rate controlled atrial
fibrillation and was started on amiodarone. ON POD #5 he was in
sinus rhythm and was ready for discharge home.
