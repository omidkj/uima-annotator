History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 82y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] w/ a PMH significant for DM2, HTN, and CAD who
presented after a recent NSTEMI ([**1-2**]) with complaints of SSCP
and dizziness.  Since his transfer home following his MI, he has
been taking coumadin/ASA/enoxaparin.  He had noted recent dark
stools along with angina/DOE and had recently reduced his ASA
dose to 81mg qd.  On the day of admission, he complained of
SSCP, SOB, and lightheadedness.  He was brought to the ED by his
son w/ these complaints.
.
In the ED, his blood pressure was noted to be 80's (baseline
mid-90s), his Hct had dropped to 23 (28 on d/c), and his CXR
showed a RLL PNA.  He had ST depressions in 1 and AvL attributed
to demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and anemia.  He
was given levaquin, vitamin K, IVF and PRBC and sent to the
MICU.  In the MICU, he was transfused to a total of 4u and his
Hct bumped to 32 where it has remained stable.  His plavix and
coumadin have been held and he received an EGD by GI showing
only gastritis w/ plans to proceed to a colonoscopy if his
bleeding does not resolve.  He has been placed on a PPI and has
done well since admission.

ECHO [**2186-1-12**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction
30 percent): the apex is akinetic; the anterior septum is
fibrotic and akinetic; the anterior free wall is severely
hypokinetic; the remainder of the left ventricle is at least
moderately hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT Head [**2186-2-10**]: No evidence for hemorrhage.  MR is more
sensitive for the evaluation of acute brain ischemia.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  Pt is a 82y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] w/ a PMH significant for DM2, HTN, and
CAD who presented w/ a GIB after a recent admission for a
NSTEMI.
.
1. Hypotension: The patient was originally hypotensive in the
ED, most likely [**3-2**] hypovolemia/acute blood loss. He never
required pressors and his BP has responded to fluid boluses and
transfusion.  After his EGD, his beta blocker was restarted and
he remained normotensive throughout the rest of his admission.
.
2. Anemia: The pt was transfused a total of 4u and his Hct rose
appropriately to this transfusion.  EGD was c/w gastritis and
his Hct has remained stable after this intervention.
.
3. CP/CAD:  Pt w/ recent NSTEMI and elevated cardiac enzymes.
He originally presented to the ER w/ CP and dyspnea.  On
arrival, he had EKG changes c/w his previous admission and felt
to be most likely [**3-2**] demand ischemia.  His continued elevated
troponins were felt to be [**3-2**] either his CRI or could still be
trending downward from his previous MI.  He completed a r/o for
MI in the ICU.  Because of his previously noted low EF, the
patient had been sent out w/ anticoagulation but, since he
returned with a GIB, further anticoagulation was deferred and
the pt will be followed in cardiology clinic to determine
further management.  He was continued on his
aspirin/bblocker/statin throughout his admission and transfused
to keep his Hct<27.
.
4. PNA: Pt w/ RLL Pna by CXR in the ED.  He was started on
levaquin for a 10d course and will complete this 2d after d/c.
He has been afebrile since being called out to the floor and his
cultures have been negative.
.
5. GIB: Pt complained of recent "dark stools" and was guaiac
positive on admission.  He was hypotensive in the ED w/ a Hct of
23.  His NG lavage was negative.  He received 4u of PRBC and was
started on a PPI.  An EGD showed only gastritis and his  Hct
remained stable after this intervention for the rest of his
hospital stay.  Because of the recent GIB, cardiology was
consulted and recommended holding off on anticoagulation in this
patient and close f/u.  GI wishes to perform a colonoscopy to
complete the w/u but will do this as an outpatient as he is
stable for d/c.
.
6. ARF: His creatinine bumped on admission, most likely
secondary to hypotension and hypoperfusion of the kidney in the
setting of an acute GIB.  He was fluid repleted during his stay
and transfused back up to a Hct>30.  After this point, his
creatinine trended downwards until reaching normal levels on his
day of d/c.
.
7. HTN: His BB was continued.
.
8. Hyperlipidemia: We continued his statin
.
9. DM2: He was given a diabetic diet and finger checks were
taken and treated w/ a ISS.  His glipizide was restarted on the
day of d/c
.
10. GERD: He was maintained on a PPI throughout his stay.
