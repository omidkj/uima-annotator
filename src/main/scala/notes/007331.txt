Service:  VASCULAR SURGERY

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 non-diabetic white
male with a known 5.7 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm who was
seen at the [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital on [**10-8**] for back
pain.  A CT scan of the abdomen showed enlargement of the AAA
to 6.3 cm.  The patient also described an episode of
shortness of breath and disorientation.  A chest x-ray done
at [**Hospital3 26615**] showed a left lower lobe pneumonia.  The
patient was started on Salmeterol and Levaquin.

The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room for a preoperative evaluation.
He was found to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response.  This was treated successfully with
intravenous Lopressor.  The patient also received two units
of fresh frozen plasma for supra-therapeutic INR.  However,
after undergoing preoperative cardiac evaluation, the patient
refused operative repair of his AAA.

The patient reconsidered and agrees to have an elective AAA
resection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, O2 dependent.
3.  Prostate carcinoma with recurrence; treated with
radiation therapy.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Diverticulosis.
6.  History of epistaxis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Transurethral resection of the prostate.
2.  Incision and drainage of abdomen.
3.  Left inguinal hernia.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **]
ambulates independently.  He quit smoking years ago.  He does
not drink alcohol.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q. day; stopped [**2104-10-13**]
preoperatively.
2.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. three times a day.

9.  Albuterol inhaler one puff twice a day.
10. O2 at three liters via nasal cannula.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were pulse of 78;
respiratory rate of 16; blood pressure 100/52.  In general,
alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Normocephalic.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.
Tongue in midline.  Pharynx clear.  Neck with range of motion
within normal limits; no lymphadenopathy of thyromegaly.
Chest:  Heart regular rate and rhythm without murmur.  Lungs:
Scattered rhonchi, no wheezing.  Abdomen soft, nontender, no
bruits.  Large pulsatile mass, mid abdomen.  Rectal
examination is deferred.  Extremities:  Feet equally warm;
arthritic changes.  Pulse examination:  Carotids, radial,
femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis pulses all two plus
bilaterally.  Posterior tibial pulses one plus bilaterally.
Neurological examination is nonfocal.

LABORATORY:  Admission labs on [**2104-10-16**], white blood cell
count 9.6, hemoglobin 11.7, hematocrit 37.6, platelets
344,000.  PT 15.3, PTT 35.7, INR 1.5.  Sodium 141, potassium
3.9, chloride 97, CO2 40, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9; glucose
116.

Chest x-ray on [**2104-10-16**], showed severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease; left lower lobe infiltrate decreased since
[**2104-10-9**] chest x-ray but with small residual focal density.

EKG on [**2104-10-10**], showed atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response and occasional ventricular ectopy.  Rate
121.

A portable transthoracic echocardiogram done on [**2104-10-10**],
was sub-optimal.  The left ventricle had a normal wall
thickness, cavity size and systolic function ( left
ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55% ).

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2104-10-16**].  A modified bowel prep was ordered.

On [**2104-10-17**], the patient underwent an uneventful AAA
repair.  The aneurysm was estimated to be 6.6 cm.  He
received two units of packed red blood cells and [**Pager number **] cc from
the Cellsaver.  EKG showed atrial flutter but no ischemia.

The patient remained intubated until postoperative day number
five, but after a short period of extubation, had to be
re-intubated because of respiratory failure.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was hypovolemic.
He received two units of packed red blood cells and two units
of fresh frozen plasma.  His cardiac enzymes were flat.  He
received another two units of packed red blood cells on
[**2104-10-20**].

Postoperative pain was managed initially with an epidural.
The patient then was given intravenous morphine 1 to 5 mg q.
four hours p.r.n. pain.  At the time of discharge, the
patient was free of incisional pain.

The patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation.
This was treated with intravenous Lopressor and intravenous
Diltiazem.  Cardiology was consulted and recommended resuming
the patient's Coumadin.  The patient was started on 5 mg of
Coumadin and will be discharged on 2 mg Coumadin p.o. q. day.
INR on [**2104-10-27**], was 2.3.

Because of the patient's prolonged intubation, he was started
on TPN.  He began to have bowel sounds and passed flatus
about postoperative day number seven.  He was able to
tolerate tea and toast.  His diet was advanced as tolerated.

Physical Therapy worked with the patient and recommended
short term rehabilitation stay.

The patient's theophylline was stopped because it was thought
by Cardiology that it was contributing to his tachycardia.
The patient's respiratory function was at baseline with
Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q. day, inhalers and O2 via nasal
cannula at three liters.

At time of dictation, the patient's abdominal and groin
incisions are clean, dry and intact.  The patient will be
discharged to short term rehabilitation facility.  He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] after discharge from
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Digoxin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Diltiazem 30 mg p.o. four times a day.
5.  Atorvastatin 20 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Ipratropium bromide, six puffs four times a day.
8.  Fluticasone 110 micrograms, four puffs twice a day.
9.  Albuterol nebulizer inhalation q. six hours p.r.n.
10. Albuterol, one to two puffs inhalation twice a day.
11. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q. 12 hours.
12. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
13. Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q. day.
14. Haldol 5 mg p.o. three times a day.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   Satisfactory.

DISPOSITION:   Short term rehabilitation.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Enlarging abdominal aortic aneurysm.
2.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm resection with aorta-bifemoral
bypass graft on [**2104-10-17**].

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1.  Blood loss anemia, status post transfusion.
2.  Respiratory failure, requiring reintubation.
3.  Postoperative malnutrition requiring total parenteral
nutrition.
