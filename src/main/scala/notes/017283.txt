Pertinent Results:
[**2122-12-30**] ECHO
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0cm2). Trace to mild aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results in the operating room at the time of
the study.
POST BYPASS The patient is being atrially paced. There is normal
right ventricular systolic function. The left ventricle displays
borderlinenormal systolic function with an ejection fraction of
50%. There is a bioprosthesis in the aortic position. It appears
well seated. No aortic regurgitation is definitively seen but
can not completely rule out a small paravalvular leak. The
leaflets can not be seen. The peak gradient through the aortic
valve was 22 mmHg with a mean gradient of 17 mmHg at a cardiac
output of about 5.5 liters/minute. The effective valve orifice
area was 1.7 cm2. The mitral regurgitation is improved - now
mild. The tricuspid regurgitation is also improved - now mild to
moderate. An echodensity consistent with a hematoma is seen in
the aortic root adjacent to the left atrium. Now blood flow can
be demonstrated within it. The thoracic aorta appears intact
after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2122-12-30**] for surgical
management of his aortic valve disease. He was taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent replacement of his aortic
valve with a tissue prosthesis. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
in stable condition for invasive monitoring. Within several
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated.

On postoperative day one, aspirin, beta blockade and diuretics
were resumed. Later on postoperative day one, he was transferred
to the step down unit for further recovery. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. His
preoperative steroid doses and Methadone for chronic myalgias
were resumed. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. The
remainder of his post-op course was uneventful and he was
discharged to rehab on post-operative day 5 with the appropriate
medications and follow-up appointments.

He was discharged to [**Location (un) 14468**] Nursing and Rehabilitation in
[**Location (un) 1456**] for further recovery prior to going home.
