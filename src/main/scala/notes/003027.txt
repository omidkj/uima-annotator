Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87780**] was admitted on [**5-8**] after undergoing endovascular
repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm with thoracic stent graft. He
tolerated the procedure well,and was transfered to the CVICU
post operatively. He remained neurovascularly intact with good
blood pressure control. On POD 1 he tolerated a regular diet,
was de-lined and transfered to the vascular floor. He remained
in sinus rhythm with brief episodes of tachycardia to the 160s
treated with lopressor IV with good response.  Cardiology was
consulted and felt this represented atrial tachycardia and not
atrial fibrillation.  We increased his metoprolol to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
from 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. He will follow up with his cardiologist within 2
weeks and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 month with CTA.
