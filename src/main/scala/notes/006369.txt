Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107336**] is an 84 yo man with a high-grade cardiac
B-cell lymphoma for which he is now undergoing R-[**Hospital1 **]
chemotherapy and a history of COPD, DVT s/p IVC filter, and
pneumonia with
respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation in [**2-27**].
Today is Day 15 of Cycle 4 or R-[**Hospital1 **], which he received during
his hospital admission from [**Date range (1) 107337**]. He received Neulasta
on [**4-10**].  following his discharge, he has been feeling generally
well; however, he admits to increasing exertional dyspnea
overthe past 2-3 days. He explains that very light activity,
such as changing his clothes or walking short distances, has
resulted in significant shortness of breath. He denies cough,
sputum production, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and
swelling/pain of the arms or legs. He admits to low-grade fevers
today; while visiting, his daughter noted that he had a
temperature of 100.4 degrees. For this reason, he was advised to
report to the Emergency Room for evaluation.

Upon arrival in the Emergency Department, had temperature of
99.6 degrees. He was tachycardic to 118 and tachypneic (RR
30-40) with oxygen saturations of 95% on room air. During the
first several minutesof is Emergency Department course, he
developed rapidly increasing work of breathing. A CXR
demonstrated no evidence ofpneumonia or effusion; furthermore,
an echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion. He was noted
to have a WBC of 8.8 with 26% neutrophils and 36% bands. Due to
progressive respiratorydistress without hypoxia, he was started
on BiPAP. In addition, he was given IV solumderol 125mg, ASA
325mg, bronchodilators, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin.
Also received total of 1.25mg of ativan in ED.

Despite a fairly normal blood gas and presumbaly secondary to
worsening dyspnea and tachynpnea, pt was started on BIPAP which
he tolerated during his transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  On arrival, he
insisted that it be removed and then resumed.  He was agitated
and extremely anxious repeating "I need air," peripheral sats
were in the 93-100% range on room air.  Seemed to be more
comfortable leaning forward and placing his weight on his upper
ext's. His HR rose in propotion to his tachypnea and gitation to
a rate of 140's transiently. Agitation/anxiey waxed and waned
with pt sleeping intermittently.

IMAGING:
CXR - The right hemidiaphragm remains persistently elevated. The

cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no focal
pulmonary
consolidation. An IVC filter is seen in the upper abdomen.
CONCLUSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
CTA chest - 1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. New small consolidation at right lung base may represent
pneumonic
consolidation or, in the setting of airway secretions,
aspiration.
3. Perhaps slight decrease in size of cardiac mass compared to
CT from [**2200-3-26**], with persistent mass effect on superior
vena cava.
4. No change in size of right adrenal mass and right lower lobe
lung nodule.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 year-old M with high-grade cardiac lymphoma (left atrial
mass), currently receiving treatment (cycle 4,day 15) with
R-[**Hospital1 **] who presented from home with low-grade fevers and
progressive dyspnea.

# Dyspnea / Tachypnea:  Ruled out for PE with chest CTA.  Rapid
respiratory viral antigen screen positive for parainfluenza type
3.  Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] overnight for closer monitoring.  Given the
possible RLL infiltrate on his chest CTA, he was initially
empirically covered with IV vancomycin and zosyn for a possible
PNA.  However, these antibiotics were discontinued the following
morning as the RRVS came back positive for parainfluenza type 3
and the patient remained afebrile overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] without
a significant leukocytosis.  He was continued with supportive
treatment for parainfluenza and continued on his home inhaler
regimen given his history of COPD.  The patient also ruled in
for a cardiac event (see below) with a decrease in his EF, which
may have also contributed to his sensation of dyspnea; however,
his films were not impressive for pulmonary edema.
.
# Positive Cardiac Biomarkers: On admission, pt with troponin to
0.23, CK 123, MB 16, and MBI 13.0.  Cardiology was consulted and
TTE revealed newly depressed LVEF 30-35% with akinesis of the
apex and distal LV.  Per cardiology, this may be consistent with
Takosubo's cardiomyopathy.  TTE was also notable for 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]R as well as depressed RV free wall contractility.  He was
started on a high dose statin, beta-blocker, full dose aspirin
and heparin gtt.  Heparin gtt was continued mostly secondary to
pt's akinetic distal LV rather than out of concern for ACS.
Cardiology also recommended anti-coagulation with coumadin for
several weeks while the pt's EF recovers; however, this will
