Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD interrogation

History of Present Illness:
68 y/o M w/ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%), CAD s/p MI [**56**] yrs
ago, and recurrent VT (ICD [**2126**], [**Hospital1 **]-v upgrade [**2131**], [**Last Name (un) 19961**]
change-out [**2137-2-15**]), s/p intracoronary stem cell therapy in
[**Country 2784**] in [**2135-6-21**], s/p multiple VT ablations most recently in
[**1-26**] and again [**4-17**]. He was taken off all antiarrhythmics (high
LFT's and prolonged baseline QTc).  His BiV pacer was also
changed from BiV pacing to AV sequential (RV only) pacing for
thought that BiV pacing may be exacerbating his recurrent VT.
Since time of last discharge, he has been feeling well until
yesterday afternoon when he felt palpitaitons and sharp
umbilical pain with firing of his device.  He presented to [**Hospital **]
clinic today and was found again to be in slow VT and sent to
CCU for management.  He was then shocked en route to the CCU
from [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] cliic.  Subjectively he feels sharp belly pain with
his VT and denies chest pain, SOB or CNS symptoms. Denies BRBPR,
melenic stools or increased orthopnea.  Took 20mg valium
yesterday [**1-23**] anxiety.


Past Medical History:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
25 years ago.
2.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
15% by echo [**8-25**].
3.  Peripheral vascular disease with poor vascular access, last
EP study [**1-26**] done via R brachial artery approach
4.  Ventricular tachycardia status post implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement s/p VT ablation and BiV ICD
upgrade (ICD is [**Company 1543**]).  Most recent VT ablation [**1-26**]
demonstrated 6 inducible VT's, 2 of which were ablated; this
required pressor support during and post-procedure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He has had a cardiac aneurysm
resected.

Social History:
Retired businessman.  He lives in [**Location 311**].  He does not smoke and
does not drink alcohol.


Family History:
Non-contributory.

Gen:  NAD, A&O X 3
Heent:  EOMI, PERRL
Neck:  No JVD or [**Doctor Last Name **] A's
Heart:  RRR, soft systolic murmur at LUSB, lateral PMI
Lungs:  Clear
Abd:  Soft, nt/nd.  NABS
Ext:  Trace edema


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  68 y/o male with ischemic DCM, PVD, and recurrent VT s/p
numerous VT ablations.

1.  Rhythm:  Pt presents with polymorphic VT at rate of 110's.
Morphology is inferior and right asix.  Appears to be at least 2
foci.  He remained hemodynamically stable, although he does
experience belly pain (? hypoperfusion in setting mesenteric
vascular dz) during the episodes.  He also experiences marked
anxiety in anticipation of ICD firing.  He was given 2mg IV
magnesium and 200mg IV amiodorone on arrival to CCU.  His pacer
was reprogrammed to BiV pacing with rate increase from 70 to 80.
 He was then started on amiodorone 200mg TID.  This appears to
have stabilized his VT.  Continued coumadin for PAF. Upon
discharge, he continues having short ([**10-5**]) beat runs of NSVT,
all of which are completely assymptomatic.

2.  Pump:  EF 15%.  Pt had no component of volume overload
during this hospitalization.  His oupt regimen was continued.
We tried switching from aldactone to eplerenone, but the pt did
not favor this medication, so he was discharged with aldactone.

3.  CAD:   Cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative.
Anti-ischemic regimen was continued as above.

4.  Transaminitis:  Pt had elevated LFT's during last
hospitalization that was attributed to lidocaine vs anesthesia
vs amiodorone.  Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] felt elevated LFT's may be [**1-23**] CHF.
 Currently at baseline with normal bili.  Likely from
hypoperfusion [**1-23**] VT.  He should have his LFT's periodically
checked now that he is back on amiodorone.

5.  Anemia:  Microcytic.  Never had C-scope.  CT scan done in
[**2137-1-22**] to evaluate for RP bleed, there were 3 small
lesions noted in his liver.  It was a noncontrast CT and so
these lesions were difficult to characterize.  They are most
likely to be hepatic cysts, but given the guaiac positive stool,
iron def. anemia,
and 68 y/o M who's never had a colonoscopy, it is worrisome for
malignancy and emphasizes the need for colonoscopy.  Because his
anemia also has a component of anemia of chronic disease, he was
given a dose of epo prior to discharge.  Should have a
colonoscopy as an outpt if any intervention is planned.

6.  Thrombocytopenia:  Chronic and stable.  No evidence of
bleeding now.  Felt to be [**1-23**] myelosuppression of unknown
etiology.

7.  CRI:  Stable.  Discharged with serum creatinine of 1.6.
Normal lytes.
