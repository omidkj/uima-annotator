History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5543**] is a 64 year-old female with PMH of hypertension,
COPD, partial gastrectomy secondary to tumor of unknown 11
months ago who initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] after the
development of mid-epigastric abdominal pain desribed as a [**6-22**]
in severity dull, aching sensation. The pain persisted for 4
hours. No similar pain in the past. Associated with nausea and
NBNB vomiting x1.
.
At [**Hospital1 **], the patient was noted to be febrile to 101.7 with
tenderness in the LUQ and RUQ on exam.  A RUQ US showed a CBD
borderline dilated at 6 mm. Amylase and LFTs were elevated.
Troponin was 7.8. The patient was started on IV heparin,
Levaquin, Flagyl and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
evaluation.
.
On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] initial vitals were 100.7 94 89/49 95% 4L
nc. 2 large IVs were placed and the patient was given 6L of NS
over her ED stay. Trop here was 0.62 (CPK/MB was 330/4) and an
ECG had no ischemic changes. Seen by cards here who felt that
trop rise was due to acute illness and not ischemia; IV heparin
was stopped. Given zosyn and vancomycin. Seen by surgery who
declined intervention. Ransons criteria gives 15% mortality.
Transferred to MICU.
.
In the MICU, the patient appears stable with initial VS  100.4
116/62 92 27 96%. Not c/o any pain.
.
ROS: (+) as per HPI. Otherwise denies palp, SOB, URI Sx, recent
weight loss, HA or vision changes. Notably had left shoulder and
arm burning pain 2 days PTA that resoved spontaneously.

Imaging:
CT A/P: 1. Findings most consistent with acute cholecystitis and
acute pancreatitis.  The common bile duct is not dilated.
However, there is focal intrahepatic biliary dilation within the
left lobe with a beaded appearance of unclear etiology though
morphology raises concern for cholangitis. Further evaluation
with MRCP is recommended.  2. Fibroid uterus. 3. Bilateral L5
pars defects with grade II anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.

CXR: Interstitial prominence, question edema or chronic lung
disease

ECHO:Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
global and regional left ventricular systolic function. Mildly
dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function. Moderate
to severe mitral annular calcification with consequent mild
mitral stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

RUQ u/s: Gallbladder wall thickening in the absence of
gallbladder
distension, pericholecystic fluid or cholelithiasis is not
specific for
cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall edema may be a secondary
phenomenon to the
primary pancreatitis in this patient. Given the equivocality of
the
ultrasound appearance and the patient's use of daily aspirin,
percutaneous
cholecystostomy tube placement was deferred at this time

MRCP:1. Evidence for mild acute pancreatitis, however, it
demonstrates uniform enhancement post-contrast. Peripancreatic
stranding and fluid surrounding the pancreas consistent with
acute pancreatitis is significantly improved since prior CT
imaging of two days prior.  2. Edema and hyperperfusion noted in
the left lateral segment of the liver
with a dilated peripheral intrahepatic bile duct demonstrating
peri-biliary enhancement. Multiple punctate bilomas /
microabscesses seen in this region.  Findings are concerning for
acute cholangitis. An underlying
cholangiocarcinoma is unlikely but cannot be entirely excluded
and short
interval follow-up in three months is recommended to confirm
resolution.
3. Gallbladder wall edema without abnormal mucosal
hyperenhancement likely
represents sequela of underlying liver and pancreas pathology.
No evidence
for cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis.
.
ERCP: A 4cm by 5FR Plastic pancreatic stent was placed
successfully to facilitate cannulation
Cannulation was still unsuccessful despite the pancreatic stent
due to altered anatomy and extremely stenotic papilla.
Therefore, a small pre cut sphincterotomy was performed which
led to successful cannulation
Sphincteroplasty was then performed using a 6 mm Hurricane
balloon.
Small amount of pus and sludge extracted successfully using a
balloon, consistent with cholangitis
Pancreatic stent was then removed using a snare
.
CXR [**12-18**]-IMPRESSION:
Interval appearance of a left lower lobe airspace process which
is concerning for pneumonia. The right lung and remaining left
lung continue to have a diffuse interstitial process, which may
be chronic or possibly represent age related changes or small
airways disease. Correlation with more remote chest films would
be helpful. There is a thoracolumbar curvature which is
unchanged. No pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Overall, cardiac
and mediastinal contours are stable. Results were phoned to Dr.

[**12-21**] CXR:
FINDINGS: According to the IV nurse, the catheter extends to
about 9 cm below the wire, which would place with tip at the
level of the cavoatrial junction.  No change in the appearance
of the heart and lungs.
