History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 87 yo female with HTN, atrial fibrillation, and dementia
who was discharged today after a 23 day stay on the
thoracic-cardiac service who presents from rehab with hypoxemic
resp failure. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2191-3-14**] after
suffering a fall at home leading to a left hip fracture. At the
outside hospital, she was diagnosed with a Type A aortic
dissection and transferred here for emergent repair. She was on
multiple pressors and drips after the OR. She then underwent
ORIF of left hip on [**2191-3-16**]. She was extubated on [**2191-3-17**]. Pt
was started on  antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia (? cipro
and flagyl). Patient was reintubated on [**2191-3-23**] (unclear exact
events). Complicating the above was a leukocytosis to >40 K,
fever, with negative c diff. CT scan of abdomen showed an
enhancement and wall thickening involving the rectum and distal
sigmoid colon consistent with an infectious inflammatory
process. She was restarted on flagyl for possible culture
negative c diff. Additionally, pt went to the OR for PEG and
trach ([**2191-4-1**]) as she was difficult to wean from the ventilator.
She was d/cd to rehab on day of admission. Of note, was also on
vancomycin on and off throughout her course, d/cd on day of
discharge.
.
At rehab on admission, pt was found to have cool extremities.
ABG was 7.25/61/78. Per report, she continued to decline with
worsening cyanosis and mottling of toes.
.
In the ED, VS on arrival were: HR: 103, BP: 76/51; RR: 24; O2:
83% trach on ? previous settings. She was changed to FiO2 of
100% (400/20/100/5). She was given 1 gram vancomycin IV x 1
(written for ceftriaxone but not given).


Past Medical History:

L hip frature and AAA repair as above

Social History:
Unable to elicit at this time.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
VS: T: 96.2; BP: 116/53; HR: 95; Vent 400/10/40/5 (after
admission to MICU. Came up on FiO2 100)
Gen: trached, sleeping, looks in NAD. Awakens but quickly falls
back to sleep.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric. PERRL 4-->3.
Neck: No LAD
CV: RRR S1S2. No M/R/G
Lungs: Anteriorly: scattered coarse breath sounds.
Abd: Soft, distended. Hyperactive bowel sounds.
Back: No rashes.
Ext: 1+ pitting edema. DP 1+. Right PICC UE coiled out. Left
femoral triple lumen.
Neuro: Wakes up but quickly falls asleep. Does not follow
commands. Pupils reactive 4->3 bilaterally.


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**4-7**]: Improved aeration of right lower lobe with persistent
retrocardiac opacity consistent with known left lower lobe
pneumonia.  A small left-sided pleural effusion.
.
KUB [**4-7**]: Bowel gas pattern most consistent with ileus.  No
evidence of
obstruction.
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**4-6**]:
1. Left lower lobe pneumona, and to a lesser extent, right
basilar pneumonia.
2. Large amount of retained stool and contrast in the rectum,
which is
distended.
3. Large stable intermediate-density collection about the
thoracic aorta,
consistent with perigraft collection or prior intramural
thrombosis.
.
CXR [**4-5**]: Status post sternotomy and aortic repair, with stable
mediastinal
appearance.  Left lower lobe opacity, concerning for pneumonia
or extensive atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo female with HTN, afib, dementia, s/p recent L ORIF and
aortic disection repair, as well as recent trach/peg for failure
to wean, who was s/p 23 day hospital stay on cardiac surgery,
d/c-ed to rehab, and returned to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypoxia.  Hospital
course by problem as outlined below:
.
1. Hypoxia- This was thought to be due to either mucus plugging
or ventilator associated pneumonia.  Chest CT and CXR showed LLL
and also R basilar PNA.  She was covered broadly with vancomycin
and aztreonam for total 10 day course.  Her ventilator settings
were weaned to FiO2 of 40%.  The stitches around her trach site
should be removed on [**4-11**] per the thoracic surgery team.
.
2. Hypotension- This was thought to be due to infection as
above.  This responded well to IV fluids.  Her metoprolol was
held.  Her lasix dose was also held.
.
3. s/p aortic dissection repair- CT read shows a well-seated
graft.  Cardiac surgery reviewed her CT scan.
.
4. Colitis- She continued her treatment for c.diff colitis
(culture negative, ct scan suggestive) until [**2191-4-8**].
.
5. Afib- Her digoxin and ASA were continued.  Metoprolol was
held for hypotension on admission.  She was continued on her
anticoagulation with coumadin.  Her INR was subtherapeutic on
discharge.  Heparin SC was given for prophyllaxis.  She was
monitored on telemetry and was rate-controlled during her stay
here.
.
6. Constipation- She had been without BM in >4 days.  She was
treated with an aggressive bowel regimen and underwent manual
disimpaction.  KUB on discharge showed ileus without
obstruction.
.
7. Depression: sertraline was continued.  Oxazepam was stopped
and changed to seroquel [**Hospital1 **].
.
8. F/E/N- Tube feeds were continued
.
9. Access: L femoral TLC (inserted [**4-6**]).
.
10. Contact: Daughter [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18945**] [**Name (NI) 72286**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 72287**] is HCP.
