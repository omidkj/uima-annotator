Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematuria, flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
64yF with history of left renal cell carcinoma presenting with
left flank pain and substernal chest pain. She was diagnosed
with renal cell carcinoma in [**5-/2139**] and started on Sutent 5 days
ago. After her first dose of Sutent, she noticed hematuria that
started after the dose and improved throughout the subsequent
day (until her next dose). After 3 doses, she had occasional
blood clots and even had difficulty urinating secondary to the
clots. She was seen in the ED on [**7-3**] and was sent home after a
negative workup. On the day of admission, she developed
abdominal/flank pain that was [**11-15**] in quality and constant in
nature. At the same time, she developed substernal chest
pressure, non-radiating, associated with nausea and one episode
of vomiting, but no shortness of breath or diaphoresis. As her
discharge instructions from the ED indicated that she should
come to the ED if she experienced any abnormal symptoms, her
family brought her to the ED.
.
In the ED, she received 1 liter normal saline, 4mg IV morphine x
2, and zofran 4mg x 1, with resolution of her symptoms. She was
admitted for pain control and rule out.


Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**2138**]: Began noticing a "bulge" in her left flank which slowly
grew in size and discomfort.
- [**2139-5-14**]: CT abdomen/pelvis showed a very large left renal mass
about 16 cm in largest diameter with question of invasion of the
left renal vein.  The lung bases showed multiple pulmonary
nodules, the largest of which was 15 mm in diameter, concerning
for pulmonary metastases.
- [**2139-5-29**]: CT chest confirmed multiple pulmonary nodules, the
largest of which was 16 x 16 mm in the left lung base.  There
were also  scattered subcentimeter nodules in the remainder of
both lungs.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Within the visualized left
lower lobe are two pulmonary metastases, measuring 1.5 cm and
1.9 cm, which are larger compared to [**2139-5-29**], previously
measured 1.1 cm x 1.4 cm respectively.  A pulmonary nodule also
within the right lower lobe (2:2) measures 1.4 cm, previously
measured 1.0 cm. Dependent atelectases are present. There is no
pleural effusion. The visualized heart and pericardium are
unremarkable, without pericardial effusion.

Redemonstrated is a large mass arising from the mid to upper
pole of the left kidney, which measures grossly 17 cm x 11 cm x
13 cm, which is not
significantly changed from prior study. The mass is
heterogeneous in
attenuation, with areas of low attenuation, likely reflective of
necrosis.  Also scattered within the mass are linear and rounded
hyperdense foci, which on a chest CT, from [**2139-5-29**],
appears similar, and may reflect areas of calcification.
Extensive feeding vessels to the mass are seen. There is
invasion and extension into the left renal vein, similar to
prior study.  Additionally, there is moderate hydronephrosis of
the left kidney, which demonstrates delayed excretion of
contrast. Within the collecting system are areas of
heterogeneous attenuation, which is concerning for tumor
invasion.

There is gallbladder wall edema, which is minimally distended.
There is also mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The
liver, spleen, pancreas, right adrenal gland, and right kidney
are unremarkable. The left adrenal gland is not well visualized,
and is obscured by the adjacent large mass.

The stomach, small and large bowel loops are unremarkable.

There is no free air or free fluid. Scattered mesenteric and
retroperitoneal
lymph nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria. No
retroperitoneal hematoma
or hemoperitoneum is seen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder and
rectum are
unremarkable. There is no pelvic free fluid or adenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identif
