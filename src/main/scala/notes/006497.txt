[**2105-12-29**] - BCx - fusobacterium species

Imaging:

[**2105-12-28**] - TTE - The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac
index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler
imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

[**2105-12-29**] - TEE - No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The
tricuspid and pulmonic valves appear structurally normal, with
no regurgitation or abnormal masses. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
No evidence of ASD. No evidence of endocarditis.

[**2105-12-28**] - CTA chest -
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Multiple nodular areas of lung consolidation could be due to
severe
infection, septic emboli. Use of toxic substances cannot be
excluded.
3. Partial atelectasis of left lower lobe, most likely due to
malpositioning of endotracheal tube.
4. Small amount of free fluid in pelvis.
5. Hypodense nodule in left lobe of the thyroid. Ultrasound is
suggested for further evaluation.
6. 35-mm left adnexal cyst, might be hemorrhagic. Pelvic
ultrasound is
suggested for followup in six weeks for documentation of
resolution .
7. Non-specific hypodense wedge-shaped area in the right kidney
that could
represent an area of infarction or pyelonephritis

[**2105-12-28**] - CT neck -
1. Multiple hypodensities within the pterygoid muscles,
parapharyngeal space, longus [**Last Name (un) **] with faintly hyperintense
rims suggestive of early abscess formation. No discrete abscess
is identified. Right neck soft tissue swelling with intracranial
extension. Associated superficial thrombosed vein.

[**2105-12-27**] - MRI head/neck -
1. Massive right neck soft tissue swelling involving the
pterygoid and
masseter muscles with associated lymphadenopathy, most prominent
at stations two and five of the neck consistent with right
external neck infection. There is intracranial extension of
infection through the foramen ovale with associated right
cavernous venous thrombosis and diffuse meningitis. There is no
definitive fluid collections on this MR study that would be
indicative of abscess.

[**2106-1-8**] - MRI head -
1. Interval development of decreased caliber of the right
internal carotid
artery in the cavernous and the carotid segments, with decrease
in the flow voids and associated enhancement along the margins
of the artery since [**2105-12-27**]. This has been described on the
study done on [**2106-1-2**] and is soemwhat worsened since then. This
likely indicates possible ongoing thrombosis of the arte
