CXR: [**2181-5-1**] In comparison with the study of [**4-30**], there is
little change in the opacification filling much of the right
hemithorax consistent with a partially loculated effusion.
Subcutaneous gas is decreasing. Opacification at the left base
in the retrocardiac region persists.
[**2181-4-29**] Both right chest tubes are in unchanged position. There
is no interval change of mild interval increase in the large
partially loculated right pleural effusion. The small apical
pneumothorax is unchanged. The adjacent consolidation at the
right lung base is unchanged as well, most likely represented
atelectasis. Subcutaneous air collection is unchanged.
There is no change in the lucency around the right heart border
that might
represent as mentioned previously either improved aeration of
the right lung or basal component of pneumothorax
[**2181-4-27**] Since [**2181-4-26**], loculated right pleural effusion
significantly reaccumulated. Two chest tubes are still in
unchanged position. Diffuse lung opacities on the right
significantly increased, could be hemorrhage, re-expansion
edema, or pulmonary edema superimposed on atelectasis. Right
pneumothorax slightly increased, still small. Left nodules are
unchanged.

Pathology: [**2181-4-26**]
Pleura, parietal, right: Metastatic carcinoma, large cell
undifferentiated type.  The morphology is consistent with a
metastasis from the patient's known renal cell carcinoma, clear
cell type.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4469**] was admitted on [**2181-4-23**] for recurrent right pleural
effusion which was drained for 1600 mL of serosanguineous fluid.
 He tolerated the procedure.  On [**2181-4-26**] his right pleural
effusion had reaccumalated and was drained for 5.2L of
serosanguineous fluid.  A Pleurx catheter was placed. He was
repleted with 2.5 Liters of normal saline but remained
hypotensive and was transferred to the SICU for close
monitoring.  Once his volume status improved he was transferred
to the floor.

Right Pleural effusion: Pleurx catheter drained on [**2181-5-2**] for
400 mL, [**2181-5-3**] 500 mL serosanguineious fluid.  He requires
daily drainage.

Pain: he was followed by the Palliative Care team.  He did not
tolerate narcotics well. His methodone was increased to 10 mg
tid with good control.

Hyponatremia improved with fluid restriction.

Leukocytosis: unclear etiology.  All cultures with no growth.

Heme: Anemia of chronic inflammation.  baseline HCT high 20's
low 30's.  Hct stable.  Upon admission his INR was slightly
elevated in the setting of poor nutrition.  He was given Vit K
with a good result.

Disposition: he was followed by physical therapy.  He requires a
walker for ambulation.
