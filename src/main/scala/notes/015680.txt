reports chest heaviness on exertion such as carrying trash cans
or walking 60 feet. This chest
discomfort resolves with 5 minutes of rest. He had a prior
stress test at the [**Hospital1 **] in [**2112**] where it was inconclusive and
pharmacological imaging was recommended. A Cardiolyte stress on
[**2117-6-9**] with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was significantly abnormal with inferior
ischemia and preserved EF. He was referred for left heart
catheterization and was found to have three vessel disease and
is now being referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
Prebypass
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Estimated EF 55%. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. A mass is present on the aortic valve,
likely fibroelastoma. Mild to moderate ([**11-23**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of
the results on [**2117-6-29**] at 0930.

Postbypass:
Preserved left ventricular function, unchanged from prebypass.
Persistent 1+ mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

Head CT [**2117-6-30**]:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass
effect.  The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  The ventricles
and sulci are unremarkable in size given the patient's age.  The
visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate minimal fluid within
the left sphenoid sinus, but the visualized portion of mastoid
air cells is clear.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process; specifically no
evidence of
hemorrhage.
Labs: [**2117-7-6**] BUN/Cr: 32/1.4

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2117-6-29**] where the patient underwent Coronary
artery bypass grafting x3 with the left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and
the free right internal mammary artery to the diagonal artery,
and spliced saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending
artery.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 patient
extubated, and breathing comfortably. The patient was
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  He did exhibit some delirium
and word finding difficulty in the initial post-op period.
Neurology was consulted and narcotics discontinued.  Head CT was
negative. Delirium cleared and the patient was oriented prior to
discharge to rehab.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  He did vacillate between
Sinus Rhythm and AFib for several days.  Beta blocker was
titrated as tolerated and the patient was started on Amiodarone
and Coumadin.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility and
rehab was recommended. Patient requires use of a walker. By the
time of discharge on POD 7 the patient was ambulating with the
use of a walker. The wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged [**Hospital3 4103**] on
the [**Doctor Last Name **] in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
