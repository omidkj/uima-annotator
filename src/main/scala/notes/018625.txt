History of Present Illness:
39 y/o M with no significant [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with
septic shock from bilateral PNA, intubated and on pressors.
.
Patient was seen by his PCP earlier today and diagnosed with
bilateral PNA on CXR, given azithromycin. Several hours later he
came back to the ED in acute respiratory distress. Initial VS:
T97.9 P112 RR 25 BP69/28 o2 sat was 80% on 100% NRB. He was
intubated and found to have thick copious secretions and started
on vanc 1 g IV/levoquin 750mg IV/ceftriaxone 1 gram IV. CVL and
a-line placed with administration of 6 L NS. An NG tube was
placed which was somewhat traumatic. His WBC was 31 and
creatinine 2.5. ABG at [**Location (un) 620**] was 7/70/200. At [**Location (un) 620**] he also
received Morphine 1g IV, tordol 30mg IV, zofran 4mg, magnesium
sulfate 2mg IV, rocurium, succinyl choline 120mg IV, etomidate
40mg, versed 9mg total, fentanyl 20mg x2.
.
On arrival to the ICU vitals were 97.6 105.69 (on levophed) RR20
81% on 500 x 18 PEEP 10 Fio2 of 100%. His ABG on arrival was
7.15/68/50/25. HI PEEP was increased to 22 and his repeat gas
was 7.15/66/110. He was still paralized.

CXR [**2184-6-6**]
There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is just above the
clavicles, 6.7 cm above the carina. This could be advanced 1 to
2 cm for more optimalplacement. There remains a consolidation
within the right upper lobe with margination of the inferior
fissure. The feeding tube tip is well below the gastroesophageal
junction. There is also some hazy opacity within the left mid
lung field suggestive of developing infiltrate.
.
CXR [**2184-6-15**]: Chest findings are stable and there are some
remaining parenchymal densities in the right upper lobe abutting
the minor fissure. No other new infiltrates are seen and no
pneumothorax is present. A left-sided PICC line is identified,
seen to terminate overlying the SVC at the
level of the carina.
.
Right upper extremity venous ultrasound [**2184-6-11**]: Occlusive
thrombus seen within the right cephalic vein. No deep vein
thrombosis seen in the remainder of the veins of the right arm.

Brief Hospital Course:
39 y/o M with no significant [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with
septic shock from bilateral PNA, intubated and on pressors.
.
#. Septic shock: The patient presented with septic shock and
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. He received 8.5L of IV fluid on
admission and required the addition of norepinephrine to
maintain his blood pressure. The patient was treated with
vancomycin, azithromycin and ceftriaxone for community acquired
pneumonia. He continued to spike high fevers for several days
after admission. As his sepsis improved, the pressors were
slowly weaned. The patient was transferred to the medical floor
on [**2184-6-14**] in stable condition.
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Thought to be secondary to
severe pneumonia. Thepatient initially was sedated and placed on
ARDSnet ventilation. He continued to draw extremely high tidal
volumes, requiring paralysis for the first 2 days of his
admission.  This was later discontinued, and the patient's
sedation was weaned as well. He had several spontaneous
breathing trials with were initially unsuccessful due to low
tidal volumes and tachypnea, however he was successfully
extubated on [**2184-6-13**]. The patient was breathing comfortably on
room air at the time time of discharge.
.
#. Community-acquired pneumonia: The patient presented with
bilateral infiltrates and septic shock. No microorganism was
identified despite repeated blood, urine, and sputum culture, as
well as bronchoaveolar lavage. The patient was treated with
azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. He completed a 5-day
course of azithromycin and was still on ceftriaxone and
vancomycin at the time of discharge. A PICC was placed prior to
discharge, with a plan to continue ceftriaxone and vancomycin
until [**2184-6-21**] (14-day course). The PICC should be removed once
the patient's antibiotic course is complete.
.
#. Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure with
a creatinine of 2.6 at the outside hospital.  With fluid
resuscitation this improved to his baseline of 1.0.
.
#. Hyperkalemia: The patient was hyperkalemic to 6.6 on
presentation, with mildly peaked T waves in V2-V4 on EKG. Most
likely secondary to renal failure.  The patient was given Ca
gluconate, insulin, glucose and albuterol on admission. His
hyperkalemia improved without further int
