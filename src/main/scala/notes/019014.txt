History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 84221**] is a 51 y/o M with a history of Ischemic CM (EF 30%,
[**12/2138**]), h/o MI (likely NSTEMI), chronic sCHF, DM, HPL, HTN, who
is transferred from OSH. Patient had presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital this AM with complaints of dizziness and
lightheadedness, that he has been experiencing over the past
month that was unchanged. Initial VS were 98.8, 85, 86/54,
99%RA. In the OSH, patient was noted to be hypotensive and
received 2L NS. He was noted to have BUN/Cr 33/1.6 there, CKMB
2.3, Trop 0.07. He had an episode of witnessed syncope on the
gurney and was noted to be faint for several seconds. It is
unclear if this was associated with any arrythmia noted on
telemetry.
.
On tranfer, patient's vital signs are stable. Patient is
conversant and denies any denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion. Denies any other episodes of syncope (other
than at OSH ED), admits to mild ankle edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 y/o M with a history of Ischemic CM (EF 30%, [**12/2138**]), h/o MI
(likely NSTEMI), chronic sCHF, DM, HPL, HTN who is transferred
from OSH after lightheadedness and syncopal episode at OSH.

# Lightheadedness and Syncope: His symptoms were likely from
dehydration.  Patient describes orthostatic symptoms that
started shorly after increasing his diuretic regimen.  At OSH
ED, while patient was on the gurney, he had a brief episode of
syncope.  He was given 2L NS.  It is unclear whether patient was
monitored on telemetry during this time, as arrythmia given his
depressed EF is also possible.  At the [**Hospital1 18**], his lasix and
blood pressure medications were held, with resolution of his
symptoms.  He had no significant events on telemetry.  He was
discharged on [**12-20**] of his prior lasix dose, and without
metolizone.  His dry weight was 140 kg.
**** Follow weight and adjust Lasix as needed.

# Coronary Artery Disease awaiting CABG: His [**11-26**] Cath with
diffuse non-obstructive LCx disease, prox TO RCA, diffuse LAD
(max 80%) stenosis.  He is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and is
scheduled to have CABG [**1-28**].  He was seen be cardiac surgery and
had his pre-op evaluation done in house.  He was evaluated by
anesthesia, had carotid ultrasound, labs and a chest x-ray.
**** Follow up results of carotid ultrasound

# Acute Renal Failure: Presented to OSH with Cr 1.6, that came
down to 1.1 here following resuscitation.  His baseline Cr is
reportedly 1.0

# DM II: Continued home 70/30 regimen.  His HbA1c came back at
11.
**** Patient needs up-titration of his insulin regimen.
