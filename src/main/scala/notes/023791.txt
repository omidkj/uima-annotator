History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 year old male with a history of COPD,
hypertension, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and end stage
congestive heart failure who was found down in his living [**Apartment Address(1) **]
days prior to admission.  He hit his head but denied history of
loss of consciousness.  He initially was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
where CT neck revealed a C2 fracture.  He was tranferred to this
hospital for further management.

In the ED, initial vs were: T: 97.3 P: 130 BP: 124/78 R: 28 O2
sat 100% on NRB. Patient was given two liters of normal saline,
morhine 2 mg IV x 1, zofran 4 mg IV x 1 and metoprolol 5 mg IV x
1. He was admitted to the TSICU for further management.

Since arrival to the TSICU he has had an MRI which shows a type
II odontoind fracture.  He also has had a right forearm xray
which revealed distal radial and ulnar styloid fractures which
have been casted.  He has been in a c-collar throughout.  While
in the TSICU he has been noted to be inattentive and
inconsistent answering questions with periods of frank agitation
where he has been combative and refusing care.  He has required
haldol and zyprexa PRN for these symptoms.  Per discussion with
the patient's son, at baseline his speech is interpretable 50%
of the time and that he often talks about the past.

He was briefly transferred to the floor on [**2109-11-1**].  There he
was receiving gentle hydration as well as PRN zyprexa, haldol
and morphine.  He was noted to be tachycardic and received
significant doses of PRN metoprolol although telemetry strips
appear to show sinus tachycardiac versus MAT.  He was initially
requiring 35% facemask but this required titration during the
day.  He was also noted to be increasingly somnolent.  Of note
his lasix has been held since admission and on the day of
intubation he received lasix 40 mg IV x 2 without significant
increase in his urine output.  He was ultimately intubated for
hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.  ABG at the time of
intubation was 7.29/65/85 on a non-rebreather.  Peri-intubation
he was transiently hypotensive and required neosynephrine.  He
had a non-contrast CT of the test which showed a possible
pneumonia versus atelectasis.  He was started on vancomycin,
cefepime and ciprofloxacin for presumed hospital acquired
pneumonia given an isolated fever to 102 degrees.  Subclavian
line was attempted but was unsuccessful and a femoral line was
placed for access.  He also had an arterial line placed and an
NGT to allow for tube feeds. He is now being transferrd to the
MICU for management of respiratory failure.

Past Medical History:
COPD - has been on inhalers in the past but is not on currently
Hypertension
Stage III Chronic Kidney Disease (baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6)
Polyarticular Gout - on prednisone 2.5 mg daily
Congestive Heart Failure (preserved EF, severe aortic
regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation)
Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy
Home oxygen requirement (2L) for unclear reasons.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**]
notes attributed both to emphysema and congestive heart failure

Social History:
Patient currently lives with his wife and his eldest son. [**Name (NI) **]
uses a walker and/or cane to get around. He occasionally dresses
himself, is able to toliet on his own. He cannot before IADLs.
He does not drink alcohol.  He quit smoking 20 years ago but has
a 50 pack year history. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] notes his diet consists of
nectar thickened liquids and ground solids.

Family History:
Coronary artery disease, hypertension.

STUDIES:

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis w/contrast [**2109-10-31**]:
1. Mild atelectasis at the left lung base.
2. Cardiomegaly.
3. Stable ascending aortic aneurysm measuring up to 5.8 cm.
4. Emphysema.
5. Diverticulosis.

MRI C-spine w/o contrast [**2109-10-31**]:
1. Ill-defined area of heterogeneous signal identified at the
odontoid process, the possibility of chronic degenerative
changes and an old unhealed fracture are considerations,
however, correlation with a dedicated MRI of the cervical spine
with contrast is recommended for further characterization.
2. Multilevel disc degenerative changes throughout the cervical
spine as described in detail above.
3. There is no evidence of focal or diffuse abnormalities within
the cervical spinal cord.

Right Forearm XRAY [**2109-10-31**]:
Study is limited due to the overlying cast material. Evaluation
for subtle fractures cannot be made on these images. However,
there is gross alignment of the elbow joint as well as of the
distal radioulnar joint. There is again seen innumerable
erosions within the carpal bones which appear similar to the
prior study of [**2108-9-11**]. No fractures of the distal
humeral shaft or of the ulnar and radial shafts are identified.
If there is high clinical concern for subtle fractures, imaging
without the cast may be more helpful.

Pelvis XRAY [**2109-10-31**]:
No evidence of trauma. Cardiomegaly. Subtle atelectasis at the
left lung base. Transitional vertebral body.

EKG: sinus tachycardia with frequent PACs, first degree AV
block, no acute ST segment changes, no change from prior dated
[**2109-10-31**].

MRI Head ([**2109-11-6**]): No evidence of acute infarct.
Moderate-to-severe changes of small vessel disease and moderate
brain at
