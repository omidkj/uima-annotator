Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
off balance since one day; Tx for ICH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 yo R-handed woman with mild dementia,
HTN and emphesema (on O2 at home), who is transferred from OSH
for ICH. History from her sister and her husband, as well as
patient (but she cannot remember all details).

The patient has been feeling "dizzy" for the last week, which
she
decribed as "lightheaded", no spinning sensation, on and off, no
factors that bring it on. She saw PCP last week for this, and
her
BP appeared not well controled (cannot tell how high). She was
told to increase cartia XT from 120mg daily to 360mg daily. She
has not yet done that.

This morning ([**3-4**]), after she woke up, her husband noticed that
her gait was off (he cannot tell if she was veiring to the right
or left). He hasn't wittnessed any falls and the pt also denies
any falls. She developed a brifrontal headache, [**4-28**], pounding.
When asked when it started she says: 10 minutes ago. However,
per
her husband she had the headache earlier during the day. Unable
to tell how it started. These problems [**Name (NI) 66735**] them to go to the
[**Name (NI) **]. She had no slurred speech, no wordfinding problems, no focal
weakness or numbness. No nausea, no vomiting.

She has been having pain in her eyes for about a month, on and
off, not specifically when moving her eyes. Blurry vision since
a
month, also on and off. Problems with writing since a month
according to her husband: she writes her words, and then halfway
through a word she continues with a scribbled line. She had
ringing in her ears a couple of times this month. Tingling in
her
R-hand, at times (during the day; cannot give specifics) during
the last month.

The CT at OSH showed a L-temporal SAH (per report of
Neurosurgery
here and radiol. resident; the disc could not be found later),
unclear whether acute or subacute. At OSH, it was read as
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

After transfer, upon arrival in the ED here, her SBP ran in the
250's. An a-line was put in and nypride gtt was started. Her SBP
then dropped to 60's during which episode the Pt was
diaphoretic.
Currently her BP in well controled in 140's. She still has her
headache. According to her family she is at baseline (not
oriented for time; forgetful).

ROS:
denies any fever, chills, weight loss, neckpain, nausea,
vomiting, dysphagia, weakness, numbness, bowel-bladder
dysfunction, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
dysuria, hematuria, or bright red blood per rectum.

MRI BRAIN: Increased signal on FLAIR images and susceptibility
artifact in the left parietal lobe sulci are consistent with the
patient's known subarachnoid hemorrhage. Multiple
periventricular and subcortical areas of increased FLAIR
intensity likely represent chronic small vessel infarction. In
the right parietotemporal lobe, two areas of increased FLAIR
intensity spare the cortex and likely represents vasogenic
edema. There are no areas of restricted diffusion to indicate
acute infarct.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Chronic microvascular infarction in the subcortical and
periventricular white matter.
3. Increased FLAIR signal in the right parietal and temporal
lobes may represent vasogenic edema. No definitive mass effect
is seen. This would be be
