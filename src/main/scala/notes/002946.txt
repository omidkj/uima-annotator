Pertinent Results:
EKG: afib rate 128; no comparison available

CXR: 1.  Multifocal airspace opacities, likely representing
aspiration or aspiration pneumonia, given mostly dependent
distribution.  Followup radiograph recommended in six weeks to
document resolution.  2.  9-mm nodular opacity in the left upper
lung zone, which may represent a lung nodule.  This can be
further evaluated with concomitant PA and lateral views at the
time of pneumonia followup.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Aspiration pneumonia:
Initially treated for an aspiration pneumonia (Vanc/Zosyn).  His
saturations improved and he was weaned off oxygen.  When the
patient was made CMO, antibiotic were stopped and he was treated
supportively.

2. Failure to thrive:
The patient was 43 kg on admission and dehydrated.  He had an
NGT placed and was started on tube feeds given an inability to
take any PO.  After the NG was pulled, an attempt was made to
replace - the patient did not tolerate this.  Given his lack of
quality of life and poor long-term prognosis, he was made
comfort measures only.

3. Atrial fibrillation:
Initially difficult to rate control, however, improved after
hydration.  He was continued on outpatient digoxin and low dose
diltiazem while NG was in place.  IV Lopressor was used after NG
was pulled.

4.  Psych/Schizophrenia:
Continued on fluphenazine and benzotropine while NG was in
place.  Later, for intermittent agitation, the patient was given
zyprexa.

Discharge Instructions:
Patient was hospitalized in the ICU with an aspiration pneumonia
which was treated with antibiotics. Given his ongoing risk of
aspiration, we attempted to place an NG tube.  The patient did
not tolerate this intervention.  We then had a discussion with
his health care proxy and [**Name2 (NI) 73091**] that given his end-stage
dementia a PEG tube was not indicated. The decision was made to
transition the patient to comfort care.

Followup Instructions:
Patient will be discharged to long-term care facility for
ongoing comfort care.
