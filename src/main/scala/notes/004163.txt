History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 57 year old female with relapsed stage II C, grade II
papillary serous ovarian cancer on Phase I trial (SNS 032)
presenting with hypoxia, worsening [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
.
Pt has known history of lung parenchymal disease from her
ovarian cancer as well as bilateral pleural effusions. She was
started on phbase 1 trial of Sunesis on [**3-23**]. Has developed
progressive SOB, [**Month/Year (2) **], hypoxia with low grade fever (in the ED)
over this time. Wears oxygen at baseline and has been having
increasing requirement from 2L up to 5L oxygen. At baseline,
patient is able to walk around her house, but unable to walk
short distances without becoming SOB. She denies fevers at home,
sick contacts, productive [**Name2 (NI) **], hemoptysis, chest pressure,
pleuritic chest pain, or lightheadedness on standing.  Patient
was intiially found in the ED to have O2sats to 85% on RA, up to
94% on NRB, with HR 100-130s. CTA negative for PE. Patient was
found to have increased bilateral pleural effusions from prior.
Patient admitted to ICU for hypoxia.
.
ROS: Recently has noted some N/V. Also mild constipation. Also
complaining of significant fatigue.  Patient denies significant
abdominal pain, headache, chills, weight loss, bruising or
bleeding.
.
Onc History:
Dx'd [**8-/2140**] with Stage IIC ovarian cancer. Pathology showed serous
papillary adenocarcinoma. She underwent TAH, Rt SPO and
cytoreduction which did not remove all lesions. She was then
treated with six cycles of carboplatin and Taxol until
[**2140-12-16**]. She relapsed in [**2146-1-9**] in the form of a mass
in the left hemipelvis. She underwent a second cytoreductive
surgery on [**2146-1-18**] followed by four cycles of carboplatin and
Taxol until [**2146-4-9**], which was discontinued because of
disease progression. She was then treated with topotecan 1.25
mg/m2 x5 days IV every three weeks for four cycles from [**Month (only) 547**]
[**2146**] until [**2146-7-10**] that was discontinued because of a rise in
her CA-125. She was treated with Doxil 40 mg per meter squared
for two cycles on [**2146-8-30**] and [**2146-9-30**], which was
discontinued because of disease progression based on a CA-125
that was rising.
She also developed a rash, mucositis, and hand-foot syndrome.
She has been on weekly Taxol and Arimidex from [**2146-11-9**] to
[**2148-12-10**] and this was discontinued because of disease
progression. She received three cycles of gemcitabine but had
significant
disease progression. She was then on Navelbine in [**Month (only) 958**] but
discontinued this in [**2149-7-10**] due to disease progression. She
was treated with Xeloda but progressed on this therapy. She was
started on oral etoposide in [**2149-11-9**] but discontinued it in
[**12-15**] [**3-13**] GI side effects and fatigue.
.
Currently on started phase 1 trial on [**3-23**] with Sunesis.

CXR- As best can be compared across modalities, there is a
markedly
stable radiograph with bilateral pleural effusions, left much
greater than right. The left effusion has loculated components
with a large intrafissural subcomponent as well.
.
CTA Chest:
1. No pulmonary embolism. No aortic dissection.
2. Interval worsening of large left loculated pleural effusion
and small right pleural effusion.
3. Similar appearance of right lower lobe total consolidation
due to
aspiration.
4. Interval slight worsening of thoracic metastatic disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 57 yo female with relapsing ovarian cancer with
metastatic disease to the lymph nodes, lungs, pleural effusions
presents with worsening dyspnea.
.
1. [**Name (NI) 1621**] Pt. with known bilateral pleural effusions secondary
to malignant effusions from ovarian cancer. She just started a
phase 1 chemotherapy trial with SNS03 on [**3-23**] and presented to
[**Hospital1 **] with SOB. There was no evidence of PE on CTA but the CT did
show worsening of the loculated bilateral pleural effusions,
which was the most likely etiology of her dyspnea. She also had
low grade fevers and was immunosupressed from chemotherapy.
Therefore, she was started on levofloxacin for possible
underlying pneumonia.  The patient was oxygen dependent was
being treated with standing nebulizer treatments. Additionally,
we performed a therapeutic thoracentesis under ultrasound
guidance. Overtime the shortness of breath did not improve,
despite these measures. The patient continued to deteriorate. A
family meeting was called to discuss further options for
intervention and goals of care. After extensive conversation
with the attending and the family and patient, the following was
decided upon: no further chemotherapy, no further interventions.
The patients code status was made DNR/DNI and the focus of her
care became comfort measures. The patient expired on [**2150-3-27**] at
3:20pm with her family at her bedside.

2. Ovarian Cancer- Unfortunately the patient had relapsed
disease and failed multiple chemo regimens. On presentation to
[**Hospital1 **] she was on a phase 1 trial drug, sunesis. The decision was
made to stop chemotherapy.
