VBG [**12-24**]: pH 7.36 / pCO2 66 / pO2 22

EKG [**12-24**]: sinus tach @ 129, nl axis/intervals.  no ST-T wave
changes, inferior Q waves (old)

CXR [**12-24**]: Portable upright AP chest radiograph is obtained.
There is a
stable appearance of bibasilar linear opacities, which likely
reflect
atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No
definite pleural effusions are appreciated. Heart size is
grossly unchanged. Mediastinal contour is stable. There is no
pneumothorax. Upper lobe lucency and splaying of
bronchovasculature likely reflects underlying emphysema.
Extensive ribcage deformity and thoracic kyphosis are again
noted.
IMPRESSION:
No significant change. No evidence of pneumothorax.
.
EKG: [**2205-1-2**]:
Sinus rhythm. Q-T interval prolongation. Compared to the
previous tracing
of [**2204-12-25**] the rate has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim
change.
.
CXR: [**2205-1-2**]:
Lateral aspect of the left lower chest is excluded from the
examination. While there is some obscuration by overlying chest
cage there may be new right perihilar consolidation. Lateral
aspect of the left lower chest is excluded from the examination.
Multiple healed rib fractures are seen on both sides of the
chest. The heart is borderline enlarged. There is no abnormality
of the imaged pleural surfaces. Thoracic aorta is tortuous but
not focally dilated. No pneumothorax.



Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o female with severe COPD and frequent flares who presents
with dyspnea, admitted to MICU for respiratory distress.
.
The patient was given levalbuterol nebs and solumedrol IV to
treat her COPD. She was intubated for hypoxia. In addition, she
was given azithromycin and ceftriaxone to treat a suspected
pulmonary infection, which might have triggered her COPD flare.
She then had ceftriaxone discontinued, and was extubated two
days later.  She did well with decreasing need for nebulizers.
In the morning, she was 100% on 4L NC; she is on 2L NC at home.
She was gradually weaned down on her oxygen. Patient was
initially given solumedrol 125 mg IV every 8 hours, and was
tapered down to prednisone 10 mg daily, which is her home dose.
She was given Atrovent nebulizers. Her sputum cultures were
negative. She then developed altered mental status and agitation
requiring quetiapine and haloperidol, which was attributed to
steroid psychosis and which improved with tapering of her
steroid dose. Her QT was prolonged to 490, which remained stable
with her antipsychotics. She was monitored on telemetry. She was
in restraints at times for her psychosis, but did not require
them in the 24 hours prior to discharge.
.
She was initially ruled out for an MI in the setting of her
shortness of breath, with three negative sets of enzymes and a
CXR which did not suggest heart failure. Her EKG was unchanged.
She was continued on her aspirin and Plavix and her other
cardioprotective medications. She was tachycardic and
hypertensive while in respiratory distress, but this improved
with improvement in her breathing.
.
Her creatinine was slightly elevated on admission to 0.9, which
improved with hydration.
.
She was continued on calcium and vitamin D for her osteoporosis
and her pain was controlled with a fentanyl patch, lidocaine,
nortryptilline and percocet. The nortriptylline was discontinued
in the setting of mental status changes.
.
She remained full code. She was given heparin SC and a PPI for
prophylaxis. Communication was with her daughters.
