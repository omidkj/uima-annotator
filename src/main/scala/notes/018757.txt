Service:  ACOVE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertensive urgency

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, diabetes type II,
chronic pain from peripheral neuropathy, deep venous
thrombosis who presented to [**Hospital6 2018**] on [**2108-3-13**] in the evening with complaints of slurred
speech, word finding difficulty, headache and nausea.  The
dysarthria had been going on for about two days.  The nausea
had been intermittent x2 weeks, but on admission was
constant.  The patient lives at [**Hospital3 537**], where her
blood pressure was found to be 220 systolic while her
baseline is 160 to 170.  She was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation.

On evaluation in the Emergency Department, the patient was
found to be neurologically intact, without signs of
dysarthria or aphasia.  Nitropaste and intravenous labetalol
were given without much effect.  Neurology consult was
obtained.  The found that the patient was neurologically
intact, recommended CT of the head.  CT of the head showed no
evidence of acute intracranial pathology.  The patient was
given 160 mg of Diovan and atenolol 25, with no significant
change.  Also, secondary to the patient's complaint of her
pain in her legs, she was given multiple doses of morphine
sulfate as well as Ativan.  She at that time had some
decrease in her blood pressure from the 240s to 200s.  The
patient was also given 5 of Norvasc, intravenous
nitroglycerin drip was started and a systolic blood pressure
of 160 to 170 was reached at a rate of 40 mcg an hour.  The
patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit due to a lack of beds on the cardiology floor.

IMAGING:  CT of the head showed no acute intracranial
process, moderate mucosal thickening of left sphenoid sinus.
Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm with normal access
and intervals, isolated Q wave in 3 and V1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  HYPERTENSION:  The patient was initially
administered multiple medications in the Emergency Department
including nitropaste, labetalol, Diovan 160, atenolol 25,
Norvasc 5 and a nitroglycerin drip was started.  In the
Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was initially on a
nitroglycerin drip, as well as some po labetalol and po
Diovan.  She had an episode of hypotension with a systolic
blood pressure into the 70s, during which time she had mental
status changes.  The nitroglycerin drip was stopped.  She was
given a normal saline bolus and her blood pressure improved
and the patient became responsive.  She then, half an hour
later, became unresponsive again but during this time her
systolic blood pressure was in the 130s.  Nitroglycerin drip
was restarted for systolic blood pressure of 212.  The
patient again became decreased, responsive and neurologic
work up commenced as described below.  The patient was also
noted to have positive cardiac enzymes during that time with
a CK peak of 637, an MB of 16, troponin of 11.6 and an MB
index of 2.5.  She went for an echocardiogram the following
day which showed an ejection fraction greater than 55%, mild
AF, trace AR and trace MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] CKs and troponins trended
down through her hospital stay, and it was thought that the
positive enzymes were secondary to her transient hypotension.

2.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient initially had a head CT that was
negative.  She was evaluated by neurology who found her to be
neurologically intact.  The patient then had some left sided
neurologic findings and decline in mental status after the
episode of hypotension.  She had an MRI/MRA which showed no
acute infarct, but decreased flow through the right MCA.
Neurology then recommended keeping the patient's systolic
blood pressure in the 160 to 180 range.  They hypothesized
that her symptoms were secondary to decreased flow during
hypotension in the setting of a decreased flow through the
right MCA.  They also recommended an EEG and carotid
Dopplers.  At the time of this dictation, results of carotid
Dopplers are pending.  The EEG results are as follows:  The
EEG showed an abnormality due to presence of intermittent
left temporal delta slowing suggestive of a subcortical
dysfunction over that region.  There was also changes
consistent with a mild to moderate widespread encephalopathy.
No epileptiform features were seen.  This was done on the
27th.  The patient, on the 28th, was noted to be having an
improved mental status.  She had been given significant
amounts of Ativan in the Emergency Department and on arrival
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  This was discontinued on
the day of the 26th and the patient became more alert and
oriented and less agitated.  On this day, she was transferred
to the floor.  She did not require any medications for
agitation and her mental status slowly returned to baseline
per her family.

3.  HEME:  The patient has a history of deep venous
thrombosis.  She was continued on Coumadin throughout her
hospital course.  She was transiently on aspirin in the
setting of ruling in, however this was then discontinued.
Whether the patient should be on aspirin long term should be
discussed with the patient's primary care physician.

4.  PULMONARY:  The patient had a chest x-ray on the 26th
that was suggestive of possible pneumonia versus atelectasis
and a repeat two days later showed resolution of this.  Her
O2 saturations remained good and no evidence of pulmonary
infection.

5.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
initially hyponatremic and on a fluid restriction.  Once she
came out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was taking
po's, her hyponatremia spontaneously resolved.  Electrolyte
imbalances that were also noted in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit including hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia
also resolved with some minimal repletion of potassium and
magnesium.  The patient was taking good po's at the time of
discharge.
