Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
66 year-old man with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, currently
neutropenic (s/p Navelbine on [**5-4**]), presenting with 1 week of
intermittent RUQ pain and vomiting, found to have acute
gallstone pancreatitis. Transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for evaluation
and management of hypotension.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: pain 8, 100.7, 114, 114/59, 18, 98%
RA. Labs were notable for WBC of 0.5, Cr of 2 (Bl 1.8), and
significant transaminitis (AST 1266, ALT 643, AlkP 333, LDH
1235, T bili 1.5). Lipase was 3360. CT A/P revealed findings
concerning for gallstone pancreatitis with 16mm distal CBD
dilation. Advanced endoscopy was consulted and decided to
perform ERCP in AM. Additionally, sBPs fell to the 70s and
improved to the 90s after a total of 6L NS. Per record, made 280
cc of UOP. Blood cultures were obtained. He was given Vancomycin
and Zosyn. No CVC was placed because he has a port for access.
.
On presentation to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient appeared comfortable and
was answering questions appropriately. He confirmed recent
abdominal pain, vomiting, and rigors. Denied hematemesis,
hematochezia, or melena.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI, + hx of neuropathy
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied cough, shortness of
breath. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
diarrhea, constipation. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias or rashes.

[**5-14**] Abdominal xray: No signs of ileus or obstruction. No signs
of free air below the right hemidiaphragm
.
[**5-14**] CT A/P: 1. Marked extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation to
1.6 cm with mild-to-moderate intra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilation with high-density material within the distal CBD with
pancreatitis in the head and neck, raising the question of
gallstone pancreatitis. Consultation with ERCP service is
recommended. The gallbladder is moderately distended without
other secondary findings of acute cholecystitis noted. 2. Known
metastatic lung cancer with partially visualized probable
metastases within the right lower lobe and left lower lobe.
Small left pleural effusion and trace right pleural effusion.
Periosteal reaction in femoral shafts likely secondary to
hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy. 3. Moderate-to-severe
colonic diverticulosis with no findings of acute diverticulitis.
No pneumoperitoneum.
.
[**5-14**] CXR:
. Increasing mild vascular congestion and bilateral pleural
effusions, left
greater than right.
2. Decreased density of left upper lobe and left lower lobe
opacities.
3. Stable position of right Port-A-Cath. No pneumothorax.
4. Multiple subcentimeter nodules in the right lung.

[**2179-5-15**] ERCP report: Impression: Stone fragments and sludge in
the biliary tree. Full cholangiogram not obtained given
cholangitis.
Normal limited pancreatogram.
A biliary sphincterotomy was performed.
Stone fragments and sludge were removed using a balloon.
A biliary stent was placed.
Normal pancreatic duct
(sphincterotomy, stent placement, stone extraction)
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

[**2179-5-18**] Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

RUQ U/S [**2179-5-18**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of gallstone.
2. Thickened and hyperemic gallbladder wall and mildly distended
gallbladder. This could reflect secondary inflammatory changes
from pancreatitis, though clinical correlation is suggested and
HIDA scan could be performed for further clarification if
indicated.
3. No evidence of choledocholithiasis, though presence of air
within much of the extrahepatic biliary system limits
assessment.
4. Right pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo M with NSCLC s/p recent chemo, now neutropenic, presenting
with abdominal pain and found to have acute pancreatitis,
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] initially for hypotension.
.
S/p gallbladder pancreatitis: Patient presented with hypotension
and sepsis which resolved with significant IV fluids (10L on
night of admission).  He also preseted with a lipase of 3360 and
findings on CT suggestive of gallstone etiology (1.6 cm CBD
dilation, distended gallbladder, and new transaminitis). Other
etiologies entertained, but highly unlikely included alcoholic,
chemotherapy-induced, or hypertriglyceridemia (labs normal).
[**Last Name (un) 5063**] criteria on admission was difficult to calculate
correctly given neutropenia; however, he had at least 3 points
predicting a mortality of 15-20%.  Advanced Endoscopy was
consulted and an ERCP with sphincterotomy was performed on [**5-15**]
and plastic stent was placed wo complication.  LFTs continued
trending down and
