Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88M with h/o systolic CHF (LVEF 35-40% in
[**2100**]), COPD, CAD, AF on ASA, bradycardia s/p PM placement
transferred on [**8-27**] from [**Hospital **] Hospital, where he was intubated
for respiratory distress, after p/w SOB x4 days. He initially
presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with SOB at rest and on minimal
exertion x4 days. He reports that at baseline, he has no SOB at
rest or on ambulation on 2L NC home oxygen, noting that he
experiences dyspnea only when hammering or doing other strenuous
activity; he denies orthopnea/PND or peripheral edema either at
baseline or in the setting of his recent OSH presentation. He
endorses occasional nonproductive cough, duration uncertain, as
well as rhinorrhea, but denies f/c, CP, pleuritic CP, wheeze,
sick contacts, or dietary indiscretion.

On arrival to the OSH ED, oxygen saturation was reportedly 88%,
prompting intubation for respiratory distress and confusion and
subsequent transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management; DD
reportedly 4.55. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was intubated and
sedated on propofol with rhonchorous BS. Initial VS were as
follows: 97, 60, 112/61, 16, 98% on MV (TV = 450, RR = 16, FiO2
= 50%, PEEP = 5). Admission labs were notable for negative TnT,
BNP to 9478, and UA with few bacteria and positive leukocytes.
ABG was 7.37/61/133/37. CXR was notable for diffuse infiltrates
concerning for CHF v. COPD exacerbation. Head CT was negative
for acute intracranial process, and CT-A was negative for PE,
but notable for moderate emphysema, bibasilar atelectasis, and
moderate cardiomegaly with a small pericardial effusion. He
received Lasix, nitropaste, methylprednisolone, azithromycin,
and Combivent nebs.

Noncontrast head CT ([**8-27**]): No evidence of acute intracranial
process.

CT-A chest ([**8-27**]):
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Moderate emphysema.
3.  Bibasilar atelectasis with secretion/aspiration seen within
left mainstem and right maintstem bronchus and bronchi to the
right lower lobe.
4.  Moderate cardiomegaly and small pericardial effusion.
5.  Ascending thoracic aortic dilation.  Enlarged main pulmonary
artery which may indicate pulmonary hypertension.

TTE ([**2104-8-30**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild-moderate aortic
regurgitation. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artery hypertension. Dilated ascending aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88M with h/o systolic CHF (LVEF 35-40% in
[**2100**]), COPD, CAD, AF on ASA, bradycardia s/p PM placement
transferred on [**8-27**] from [**Hospital **] Hospital, where he was intubated
for respiratory distress, after p/w SOB x4 days, now breathing
well post-extubation.

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure: He presented from an OSH
intubated and sedated and  received aggressive diuresis for CHF
(noted below), as well as steroids for COPD exacerbation (noted
below). He was extubated successfully on [**8-27**] without fever, HD
instability, leukocytosis, or other e/o infection throughout
admission.

#Acute-on-chronic CHF: Patient with known sytolic CHF (LVEF
35-40% in [**2100**]) p/w clinical e/o fluid overload and CXR with
prominent pulmonary vasculature in the absence of clear inciting
event. He was diuresed with IV Lasix, with good effect, followed
by 80mg PO daily, up from his home dose of 40mg PO daily, with
resulting mild hypervolemia and return to his home supplemental
oxygen requirement of 2L, prompting transfer from the MICU to
the medical floor. On attainment of euvolemia on the floor, his
home dose of Lasix 40mg PO daily was continued. Home atenolol
and lisinopril were continued. TTE demonstrated  mild-moderate
AR, mild symmetric LVH with preserved regional and global
biventricular systolic function (LVEF >55%), mild PA HTN, and
dilated ascending aorta. By the time of discharge, he was
breathing comfortable without supplemental oxygen requirement.

#COPD: Patient with known COPD was noted to be hypercarbic while
ventilated. He initially received methylprednisolone, followed
by prednisone burst 30mg x5 days, though azithromycin was held
following an initial dose since his symptoms were felt to be
largely reflective of CHF exacerbation in the presence of
clinical hypervolemia and in the absence of prominent wheeze.
Albuterol/ipratropium nebs were continued throughout.

#CKI: Cr of 1.3 on admission, c/w baselin, remained relatively
stable throughout (1.3-1.5) despite aggressive diuresis.

#AF on ASA: Admission EKG demonstrated AF, but he remained in SR
thereafter and V-paced at 60bpm. He is on ASA 325mg as an
outpatient in place of Coumadin due to h/o falls and
supratherapeutic INR (as high as 9.7 in [**2102**]) c/b GI bleed, and
ASA was continued on this admission.

#Thrombocytopenia: He displayed stable thrombocytopenia
(100s-140s) throughout admission, c/w baseline, without active
signs of bleeding. Further evaluation was deferred to the
outpatient setting.

#CAD/HTN: Home atenolol, lisinopril, and ASA were continued on
this admission.

#Dementia: Patient with h/o dementia of uncertain etiology was
rarely agitated, but largely calmly AOx1/confused throughout
admission.

#BPH: Home tamsulosin was continued on this admission.

#Transitional issues:
