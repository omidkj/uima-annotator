History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 year old female with PMH of DM2, asthma, PVD,
rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, multiple non-healing
ulcers and sacral decubitus ulcers presenting for further
evaluation of altered mental status and fevers noted by the
patient's home VNA service. The patient has been admitted 4
times this year for multiple issues including cellulitis and
[**Last Name (un) **]. Each time, the patient refuses to go to a rehab facility
and instead opts for going home with VNA services. The VNA
observed the patient talking to and asking for family members
who have already passed.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.5 95 111/58 16 95%. She was
sleepy but arousable and oriented to person and intermittently
to time. Stage II sacral decubitus ulcers with erythematous
bases were noted with small ~ 2x2 cm areas with purulent
discharge. Chronic bilateral lower extremity ulcers for which
she completed a course of Vancomycin for on previous admissions
were erythematous with clean bases. Per the ED, her UA was
positive and she was treated with ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV for
possible UTI. She was also given 1 liter of IVF for [**Last Name (un) **]. She is
incontinent of stool and wheelchair bound with chronic Foley for
urinary incontinence. Transfer vitals were 96.9 94 117/49 16 99%
1L.
.
On the floor, the patient is aroused with wound care, but is
otherwise somnolent and will not provide a history

STUDIES:
CXR [**2149-8-22**]:
SINGLE VIEW CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is borderline cardiomegaly.
Both lungs appear grossly clear with no focal consolidation,
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Minimal scarring opacification
at the right upper lung is stable in appearance since multiple
priors.

IMPRESSION: Borderline cardiomegaly. No acute cardiopulmonary
process.
.
KUB [**2149-8-23**]:
There is no evidence of toxic megacolon. There is a
nonobstructing bowel gas pattern with few air-filled
nondistended small bowel loops in the pelvis and air-filled
transverse colon measuring up to 6.2 cm. Coarse calcification in
the left pelvis is unchanged from [**2140**]. Hardware in the left
proximal femur is partially visualized.
.
TTE [**2149-8-25**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2142-11-23**] , mild aortic stenosis is new. No
vegetation is seen. However, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
