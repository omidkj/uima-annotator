Chief Complaint:
Head trauma after fall.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year-old man with a history of HTN and
Alzheimer's who presents following a fall.  He apparently was at
his group home earlier this evening when he got into a fight
with
another resident.  He reportedly took at swing at the resident,
and then attempted to kick him, but in the process ended up
falling straight backwards and striking the back of his head on
the ground very hard.  EMS was called, and on arrival they noted
that he was conscious but aphasic and had a left facial droop.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 26615**] hospital where he was noted to have
a
GCS of 12, intermittently stating 'I want to go home.'  He had a
NCHCT which showed a non-depressed L frontal skull fracture,
bifrontal SAH, parafalcine and tentorial SDH, and hemorrhagic
contusions of the left temporal lobe.  He was then transferred
to
[**Hospital1 18**] where he was evaluated by trauma and Neurosurgery.  On
arrival he had a repeat head CT which showed, in addition to the
known hemorrhages, a new R pontine, midbrain and thalamic
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  His mental status declined to the
point where he was intubated.  Neurosurgery determined that
there
was no indication for surgical intervention, at which point
Neurology was consulted.
