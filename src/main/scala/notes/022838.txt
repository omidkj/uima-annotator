History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 y.o. male with h/o ischemic CM, CRI,  EF =
30% who is admitted from clinic for volume overload and failure
to diurese despite receiving twice weekly infusions of natrecor.
Of note upon admission his BNP is [**Numeric Identifier 7155**] increased from 2587 on
[**2105-2-26**]. He is admitted for medical management until
he can obtain a bed in the CCU where he will undergo tailored
therapy.  His dry wt = 130 lbs and today in clinic his dry wt =
138.5 lbs.

that his SOB on exertion is no worse than usual, in the past two
weeks he has only used SLNG once.  He can walk 50 yards before
becoming SOB. He is currently c/o back pain which is chronic and
he thinks that this most recent exacerbation of back pain may
have been by malposition while sleeping.  Can lay flat on one

edema.  No PND. NO f/c/n/v/d.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] was an 83 yo male with a complex cardiac history, EF
of 30%. He was on biweekly natrecor with resistant volume
overload and was admitted for tailored therapy. On admission
clearly volume overload by exam(elevated JVP and LE edema). On
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**], he recieved lasix and nesiritide with no relief of volume
status. He was transferred to ICU for ultrafiltration. Central
line consented. Hydralazine, imdur, lasix, and nesiritide were
continued.

He has a history of atrial fibrillation, now in NSR on
amiodarone. He was continued on aspirin and lipitor. Mr [**Known lastname 656**]
has ischemic Cardiomyopathy with apical aneurysm, on coumadin at
home, switched to heparin gtt here.  He has a [**Hospital3 9642**] MVR. INR
goal 2.5-3.5 but coumadin stopped and was on heparin on the
floor. This was temporarily stopped for line placement. For his
hypothyroidism, his TSH was checked and, his current dose of
levothyroxine was continued.

Th patient has CRF with Cr baseline at 3.2-3.5 He's also on EPO
for anemia of chronic disease. He was started on CHF solutions
and received a treatment taking about 2 liters off. Then his
lines clotted and the treatment was stopped. About 10 minutes
later, he started complaining of extreme right "kidney" pain. He
was screaming and demanded 2 mg of morphine, shouting, "I am a
surgeon. Give me morphine! 2mg morphine!" He was given 1 mg of
morphine which provided some relief. About 15 minutes later, the
patient became hypotensive and unresponsive. A code was
initiated and the patient was intubated. Three pressors were
started. Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] was found to have a HCT drop of 31 to 21. It
was thought that the patient had a catastrophic intraabdominal
bleed, either from a ruptured abdominal aorta or from a ruptured
renal mass. The patient expired within a few hours.
