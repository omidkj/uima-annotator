IMAGING AND DIAGNOSTICS:
CXR [**2-23**]:
1. Left lower lobe opacity with a possible concomitant effusion
and
associated dense retrocardiac atelectasis. This could reflect an
infectious
process and/or dependent changes.
2. Unchanged right cardiac contour. Please note the known right
atrial
intracardiac tumor is not discernable on the current study.
3. ET tube terminating 5.3 cm above the carina.

Renal U/S [**3-3**]:
1. Simple cysts in bilateral kidneys.
2. Echogenic focus in the upper pole of left kidney could
represent a
complex/hemorrhagic cyst or angiomyolipoma.
3. Midly echogenic renal cortices. Nonspecific finding and could
reflect
underlying medical renal disease.
Patent bilateral main renal veins and artery. However, the
examination was limited due to patient's inability to hold
breath given
underlying COPD.

MAG-3 Renal Scan [**3-6**]:
1. Normal flow to both kidneys, and no evidence of obstruction.
2.
Symmetric delayed excretion from both kidneys, suggestive of
intrinsic renal dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with high-grade cardiac lymphoma s/p 2nd cycle R-[**Hospital1 **],
DVT s/p filter placement who presented with acute respiratory
distress and LLL Pneumonia. Discharged in stable condition to
rehab.

#. Pneumonia complicated by Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure.
Patient intubated upon admission but quickly extubated. He was
treated with a 14 day course of vancomycin and zosyn (switched
to meropenem due to acute renal failure as described below) with
excellent clinical improvement. He was weaned from oxygen and
remained on room air. Ambulatory saturations remained >93%. He
was given nebulizer treatments and continued on inhaled steroids
per his OMR home medication regimen.  He recovere and no longer
needed nebulizer treatments.  Continue on home steroids.
Discharged on 1 month of po levaquin.

#. High-grade Cardiac Lymphoma - The patient was due to have his
third cycle of R-[**Hospital1 **] during the second week in [**Month (only) 547**]. Given
his pneumonia, this was delayed several days. Once the patient
showed clinical improvement and his chest CT from [**Hospital3 12748**] was received by [**Hospital1 18**] and reviewed by radiology
with a favorable comparison to his pre-cycle 2 CT, he was given
a third cycle of R-[**Hospital1 **]. He tolerated this well with minimal
nausea. On [**3-16**], he was started on filgrastim with a plan to
return to clinic every other day from rehab for administration.
Son to bring him in.

#. DVT - Patient had a temporary IVC filter placed during his
last admission given the thought that he was too high risk for
anti-coagulation. He was given sub-cutaneous heparin and
ambulated in the halls frequently during this admission.

shortness of breath, to be given q6H PRN.
