History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old man with history of fall at home the
night before admission. He noted that he was stepping backwards
to get into bed when he fell around 7pm; he does not remember
how it happened but did not lose consciousness. He had been
drinking alcohol prior to fall. He fell backwards and hit the
back of his head against the windowsill and then hit his
buttocks on the ground. He believed he may have landed
afterwards on his left shoulder. He got back into bed and tried
to go to sleep.  Around 2-3AM, he was in so much pain from his
left shoulder that he called out to his son in the next room to
call the nurse on call from his primary care doctor's office. He
denies ever having had any neck pain. He had drank some alcohol
the evening prior to his fall.
.
He went to [**Hospital3 **] by EMS for initial evaluation and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because of the trauma and orthopedic
surgical services. Patient was noted to not have any
neurological deficits, except a left sided foot drop which he
has had at baseline.
.
Patient has a history of known spinal disc bulging in two places
in his spine, including his neck, and has had two surgeries in
the past. He notes that he has intermittent tingling in his left
hand, fourth and fifth digits, at baseline, but he feels no new
symptoms of numbness, tingling or weakness. He does have a
history of recurrent UTIs at baseline, often experiencing
symptoms of urinary urgency and frequency; he takes
nitrofurantoin daily for prophylaxis.  He denies urinary
incontinence, except very occasionally, though not new since his
recent fall.  He denies any urinary retention or incontinence of
stool.

u/s [**7-23**] shows 50% occlusion on L and widely patent right
carotid; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17974**]; carotid ultrasound [**8-25**] showed

occluded in midposition w collateral filling ... Given 3vessel
CAD and L ventric dysfunction, surgical revasc recommended. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] did 4vessel CABG bypass.  He had a LIMA to LAD.  Had a
vein graft to posterior descending artery. Additionally had a Y

management of his inducible ventricular tachycardia and also
observed periods of bradyarrhythmia
-Lumbar Disc Disease
    - lumbar MRI [**3-21**] showed [**Last Name (un) **] disc disease at multiple

margin; re-excised [**7-27**] w clear margins
-Cerebrovascular Disease
-Ataxia [**1-21**] Cerebrovascular Disease
- chronic due to cerebrovascular disease ; unsteady w abrupt
changes in direction; head CT [**Hospital1 2025**] [**4-26**] showed: No acute
intracranial process. Specifically no evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage, acute territorial infarction or mass lesion. Remote
lacunar infarct involving R head of the caudate/right anterior
limb of internal capsule. Remote R superior cerebellar
infarction. Nonspecific white matter hypoattenuation likely
representing chronic microangiopathic change


Social History:
Lives at home with son. Wife died in [**2170-12-20**]. Son sleeps in
bedroom next to his. Reports prior history of significant
alcohol use; he states that he quit using alcohol for 28 years
until this year.  PCP notes that he has had a couple of episodes
of drinking this fall associated with depression after wife's
death.  He notes that he quit smoking 20 years ago.  Used to
work for the [**Location (un) 86**] Globe as a type setter but lost his job
after everything became computerized.

Pertinent Results:
CT Head w/o contrast [**2171-12-17**]:
1. No acute bleed, mass, or infarct present.
2. Prominence of the superior ophthalmic veins, right greater
than left.
Recommend clinical correlation, an MRI would be useful if
further imaging
characterization is deemed necessary.
.
CT C-spine [**2171-12-17**]:
1. Anterolisthesis of the C6 vertebra with a bilateral pedicle
fractures and a jumped facet on the left. An MRI of the C-Spine
is recommended if there is concern for a ligamentous injury.
2. Severe narrowing of the spinal canal at the C3-C4 and C4-C5
level and
moderate narrowing at the C5-C6 and C6-C7 level.
.
CT Chest w/out Contrast [**2171-12-18**]:
1. Intralobular septal thickening consistent with hydrostatic
edema probably due to volume overload. Additional dependent
ground-glass opacities affecting right lung more than the left
may reflect dependent edema or secondary process such as
aspiration.
2. Small right and trace left dependent pleural effusions.
3. No evidence of thoracic spine or rib acute fracture. Please
see
separately dictated CT of the cervical spine study, which
reports bilateral pedicle fractures at the C6 vertebral body
level.
4. 3-mm diameter right apical nodule, statistically very likely
benign.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes including 12 mm lower left
paratracheal and 15 mm subcarinal nodes are probably
hyperplastic or edematous. However, recommend a followup CT in
six months to document resolution of the enlarged nodes and
anticipated stabili
