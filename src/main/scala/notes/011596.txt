History of Present Illness:
59 y/o M with severe COPD and lung cancer s/p left VATS + wedge
resection X 2 ([**2105**] and [**2106**]) complicated by subqemphysema,
admitted electively to [**Hospital3 26615**] hospital and underwent left
VATS + LUL wedge resection on [**12-7**]. He came out of surgery with
one chest tube then on POD # 2 noted to have increasing SQ
emphysema with CT showing pneumopthorax for which a 2nd anterior
chest tube was palced. On POD # 9 ([**12-16**]) developed dyspnea
found to have pneumothorax again and 3rd chest tube was placed.
On POD # 12 ([**12-19**]) developed confusion and spiked fever to 101
with WBC to 15,000, noted to have purulent discharge from
surgical wounds. Cultures grew MRSA from wound, chest tube and
blood. Was started on Abx (Vanc + zosyn) on [**12-19**]. On [**12-20**]
patient developed dyspnea and respiratory acidosis and was
intubated, noted to have quasi-purulent drainage from ET tube.
Bronchoscopy [**12-21**] was performed with theraputic lavage.
Subsequently fever resolved and WBC trended down from 18,000 in
AM to 12,000 in PM on day of transfer. Was transfered per
family's request.

Chest CT [**2108-12-25**]:
1. Fistula between the left pleural space/tract of the prior
left upper lobe chest tube extending to the left anterior chest
wall and exiting the skin surface along the remaining chest tube
tract. No discrete abscess.
2. Chest tube coursing through the left lower lobe remains
unchanged in position. However, the intraparenchymal portion of
the tube remains completely opacified and may be clogged.
3. Small left pleural effusion and small left pneumothorax have
slightly increased in size since the [**2109-12-21**] study.
4. Stable pneumomediastinum.
5. Improvement of extensive subcutaneous air along the entire
thorax.

[**2110-1-1**] CXR :
In comparison with the study of [**12-29**] and [**12-30**], there is again
relatively the lower expansion of the left hemithorax. Areas of
loculated air and fluid are again seen on the left, though
comparison is difficult since the current study is supine rather
than [**Last Name (LF) 92555**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] that the air-fluid levels are not appreciated.
Patchy opacification at the left base is again seen.   The right
lung is relatively clear. Subcutaneous emphysema is seen along
both lateral chest walls.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 y/o M w/h/o COPD and lung cancer transfered from OSH on POD
14 s/p left VATS + LUL wedge resection complicated by
pneumothorax and pneumonia requiring 3 chest tubes.

MICU course:
For MRSA pneumonia, he was continued on IV Vanco 1000mg Q12h and
initially covered for gram negative with Zosyn which was
discontinued on [**2109-12-24**]. Required intubation for this pneumonia
and pneumothoraxes post-op. Extubated successfully on [**2109-12-23**].
The anterior chest tube within lung parenchyma was removed, and
the 2nd and 3rd tube were kept in place. His subcutaneous
emphysema slowly resolved over the course of his MICU stay.
Post-extubation he was transferred to the floor.

Medicine Floor course:
He was stable on the floor, requiring only small amounts of
supplemental oxygen. He continued vancomycin for pneumonia. His
posterior chest tube was removed without incident. A repeat CT
scan showed a persistent fistula between lung parenchyma and the
chest wall. On [**12-28**], his anterior chest tube fell out. He had no
further dyspnea or pneumothorax but he clearly had an undrained
fluid collection in the left anterior chest. On [**12-30**] he was taken
to the Operating Room and transferred where he underwent a left
rib resection and Eloessar flap for better drainage of the
empyema.  he tolerated the procedure well and returned to the
PACU in stable condition.  He maintained stable hemodynamics and
his pain was well controlled with a Dilaudid PCA.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to
progress.  His dressing was being changed [**Hospital1 **] initially and
eventually changed to daily as the wound was cleaning up nicely.
 He was up and walking with assistance and still had oxygen
requirements with ambulation.  The Pulmonary service was
consulted for recommendations for his COPD and Advair and
Spiriva were added to his nebulizer treatments.  They also
recommended full PFT's when able.  His Vancomycin stopped on
[**2109-12-31**].

He had some urinary retention after his Foley catheter was
removed and finally passed his second voiding trial.  His
baseline creatinine is normal but he rose to 1.4 on [**2110-1-1**].  At
that point his Toradol and Lasix was stopped and he was given
extra IV hydration.  His creatinine peaked at 2.3 on hospital
day 15 during which time the Nephrology service was consulted.
As the patient was noted to have had some eosinophilia a few
days earlier during his hospital course, the Nephrology team
concluded that his rising creatnine could be secondary to
allergic interstitial nephritis (possibly related to prior Zosyn
or Protonix use), although it was more likey attributed to TIN
secondary to prior Toradol administration. Recommendations were
to continue hydration and allow t
