HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45 year old
female, being anticoagulated with Coumadin, status post
mitral valve replacement, #27 Carbomedics in [**2151**].  She
presented to the Emergency Department with one day history of
abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum.  The patient
usually takes 7 mg of Coumadin during the week days and 9 mg
of Coumadin on the weekends, as per husband who administers
her medications.  Reportedly, she had an INR of 3.2 ten days
prior to admission.  One day prior to admission, the patient
started having crampy abdominal pain, mostly in the left
lower quadrant.  Pain was non radiating but progressively
worsened in intensity. Since the beginning of the abdominal
pain, the patient reports having passed three bloody bowel
movements with visible clots in the toilet.  The patient
denies fevers, chills, sweats or any other systemic symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Rheumatic heart disease with mitral
stenosis and mitral regurgitation, status post mitral valve
replacement in [**2151**], with 27 mm Carbomedics mitral valve
(mechanical).  Asthma.  Hypercholesterolemia. Anxiety.  Panic
disorder.  History of poly substance abuse, including alcohol
and cocaine.  [**Location (un) 15587**] disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Mitral valve replacement in [**2151**] as
mentioned above.  Tubal ligation.

ALLERGIES:  The patient reports allergic reaction to
Penicillin and aspirin.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q. day.
Coumadin regular home regimen of 7 mg on week days and 9 mg
p.o. q. day on weekends, although the history is not clear
whether the patient had been taking mostly 9 mg p.o. q. day
prior to admission.
Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. q h.s.
Clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. q h.s.
Trazodone 150 mg q h.s.
Proventil MDI inhaled twice a day.
Calcium, Vitamin D and Vitamin C.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for prior abuse of cocaine and
alcohol. The patient reports continuing one pack per day
history of smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature of 98.4; heart rate of 94;
blood pressure of 105/86; respiratory rate of 16; 96% on room
air.  The patient was alert and oriented times three and not
in apparent distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:
Within normal limits.  Cardiovascular examination:  Regular
rate and rhythm with S1 and S2, 3/6 systolic murmur,
consistent with history of mitral valve replacement.
Respiratory examination:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal examination with bowel sounds soft, diffusely
tender.  Abdomen with worse pain and tenderness in the left
lower quadrant with rebound and guarding.  There was no
rigidity.  Extremities were warm and well perfused without
edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 10.2; hematocrit
of 41.9; platelets of 202.  PT was 100; PTT was 82.3 with INR
of 112.3.  Chemistries were 143, potassium of 3.6; chloride
105; C02 of 27; BUN of 10 and creatinine of 0.6; glucose of
125.  AST was 59; ALT was 28; alkaline phosphatase was 83;
Total bilirubin was 0.4; amylase 71 and lipase of 37.

Urinalysis showed large amounts of blood in the urine.

CT scan of the abdomen showed a 10 cm segment of the proximal
sigmoid colon with low attenuation signal within the sigmoid
wall.  There were also several small diverticula noted within
the sigmoid colon. There was minimal stranding in the
adjacent fat and trace amount of free fluid within the
pelvis. These readings were consistent with intramural
hemorrhage of the sigmoid colon.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Because of the significantly elevated INR
of 112.3, the patient was urgently given two units of FFP, 10
mg of Vitamin K p.o., and one dose of Factor VII, (2,400
units) while in the Emergency Department.  The patient was
followed closely with serial hematocrit checks and serial INR
checks.  The gastrointestinal service and the surgery service
were called for urgent consultation.  It was decided that the
patient should be admitted to the surgical Intensive Care
Unit for management of the anticoagulation.

Within a span of six hours of the treatment for the elevated
INR while in the Emergency Department, the patient's INR came
down to a level of 2.2 and, in the next two hours, the INR
dropped down to 0.6. Given the mechanical valve, the patient
was urgently started on heparin drip without a loading bolus.
The patient was started on 18 units per kg per hour which
translates to 800 units per hour, with a goal PTT of 60 to
80.  However, the patient's PTT rose up to 120 after six
hours of treatment on heparin drip at 800 units per hour and
the heparin was held for one hour and restarted at 700 units
per hour. Serial check of the PT, PTT and hematocrit with
subsequent adjustment in the heparin drip stabilized the
patient at an acceptable PTT level, within the goal of 60 to
80 and the hematocrit remained stable.  (It should be noted
that while the patient had a hematocrit of 41.9 on admission,
recheck of the hematocrit nine hours later showed hematocrit
of 34.8 and, with proper resuscitation, the patient's
hematocrit dropped to 30.5 on hospital day number two and
this was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit and the
hematocrit remained stable and increased slightly while being
observed in the Intensive Care Unit.  Thus, the hematocrit
was deemed to be stable and there were no suspicions that the
patient was continuing to bleed.)

At the end of hospital day number two, with documented
evidence of stable hematocrit as explained above, and proper
anticoagulation on heparin drip, the patient was transferred
to the floor.  While on the floor, the patient was maintained
n.p.o. because she had not passed flatus during the two days
of her hospital stay to that point. There was a question
whether or not the sigmoid intramural hematoma may be causing
an obstruction. It was thought to possibly be causing an
obstruction.

The patient underwent a Hypaque enema on hospital day number
five to rule out obstruction and the Hypaque enema did not
show any obstructing lesion. Given the stable nature of the
patient, the patient was started on p.o. which she tolerated
without any difficulty and without any episode of bright red
blood per rectum.  The patient's Coumadin had been held for
three days by hospital day number five and, in discussion
with the patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the
[**Hospital3 **] at which the patient is followed up,
the patient was restarted on Coumadin of 7 mg.  The patient's
INR which had drifted down to 0.6 with the quick reversal at
the Emergency Department on the day of admission, slowly
increased with the depletion of the Factor VII infusion which
had been given on hospital day number one.  On the day of
discharge, on hospital day number six, the INR was 2.5.  The
patient was discharged home with Coumadin schedule of 7 mg
p.o. q h.s. during week days and the weekends.  The patient
was instructed to follow-up on the day after discharge at the
[**Hospital3 **] for check of the INR.  On the day of
discharge, the patient was tolerating a regular diet, without
any difficulty, without any episodes of bright red blood per
rectum.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Sigmoid hematoma, secondary to over anticoagulation, status
post mitral valve replacement.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
The patient is to continue all her preadmission medications
as ordered by her primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] the exception
of Coumadin and the patient is to take 7 mg p.o. q h.s.
daily.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to be seen at the [**Hospital1 346**] [**Hospital3 **] on the day
after discharge, on [**2158-12-13**] for check of her INR.
The patient is to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 452**], gastroenterologist in four
weeks for sigmoidoscopy and is to call for an appointment
date and time. The patient is to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1888**] of
Gastrointestinal surgery in six weeks for surgical consult
and will call his office for appointment date and time.  The
patient needs to see her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
