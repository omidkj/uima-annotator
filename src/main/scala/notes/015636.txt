Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Wheezing and Somnolence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
64 yo M with complex medical history including history of COPD
and complex sleep disordered breathing. Presented to hospital on
[**2113-11-6**] from [**Hospital3 **] after three days of cough,
dyspnea, and loss of appetite. As outpatient he was thought to
have pneumonia and was started on levofloxacin with addition of
ceftriaxone earlier today when there was no improvement in
symptoms. Initial labwork at [**Hospital3 **] facility showed a
leukocytosis of 15.7 with 14% bands and a new elevation in Cr up
to 2.4. Additionally had hypoxemia with O2 sat down to 79%. At
that point NRB was applied and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.
.
On the medical floor, the primary team was treating primarily
for COPD exacerbation and HCAP. As patient's breathing was
appearing labored around 2200, an ABG was 7.34/67/63. Given that
patient appeared to have a baseline pCO2 around 80 in [**Month (only) 216**] of
this year, team opted for close monitoring through the night. At
approximately 0200 today, the patient was triggered for
increasing somnolence and tachypnea. The covering nightfloat
intern performed two separate ABGs which showed a trend toward
worsening acidosis with serial measures of 7.32/74/80 at 0054
today and 7.28/79/77 at 0147 today. Given this trend, decision
was made to tranfer to the MICU for non-invasive ventilation.
Patient was afebrile and normotensive on floor. Of note, patient
has a diagnosis of complex sleep disordered breathing with
recent BiPAP titration in sleep lab on [**2113-9-18**]. Was initially
diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing during inpatient
admission in 12/[**2112**].
.
While in the MICU, the patient was started on a 10-day course of
vancomycin/cefepime and 5-day course of azithromycin.  He was
also re-started on his home BiPAP.  His hypoxemia improved, and
he was transferred back to the medical floor.
.
The patient remained stable on the medical floor and reported
subjective improvement in his breathing.  His O2sat's remained
stable on supplemental oxygen, and he remained afebrile without
leukocytosis.  When he returned to the medical floor, a
hyperkeratotic, hyperpigmented, raised, demarcated patch was
noted on his left lower extremity.  We will recommend that the
patient be followed on an out-patient basis by dermatology.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2113-11-8**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.
Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):

.
ECG [**2113-11-6**]:
Sinus tachycardia. QRS width at 160 milliseconds. Right
bundle-branch block. Axis indeterminate. Since the previous
tracing of [**2113-8-22**] the rate is faster.
.
CXR (AP) [**2113-11-6**]:
ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST: The lungs are low in volume and show a
right upper lobe consolidation. Elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm is unchanged compared to prior exam. The cardiac
silhouette is mildly enlarged. No definite pleural effusions are
noted.

IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe pneumonia. Limited exam.
.
ECG [**2113-11-7**]:
Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing the rate is slower. Now
apparent are  ST segment elevations in the early precordial
leads V2-V6 are more prominent, although were present to a
lesser degree on [**2113-8-22**]. Clinical correlation is  suggested.
.
CXR (AP) [**2113-11-8**]:
IMPRESSION: Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm and associated
left lower lobe atelectasis  are longstanding. Large area of
consolidation in the right upper lobe, new since [**8-24**], is
more extensive today than on [**11-6**]. Heart is mildly
enlarged. Right lower lung grossly clear. No appreciable pleural
effusion.
.
CXR(AP) [**2113-11-9**]:
IMPRESSION: Stable right upper lobe consolidation with small
right pleural
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo M with complex medical history including history of COPD
and complex sleep disordered breathing. Presented to hospital
with clinical history of pneumonia and then developed somnolence
on medical floor in setting of suspected COPD exacerbation.
Transferred to the MICU due to increasing somnolence and
respiratory acidosis, started on BiPAP and
vancomycin/cefepime/azithromycin antibiotic regimen, then
returned to the medical floor with stable O2sats on supplemental
oxygen.
.
#. Acute on chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure:
Patient with history of COPD and complex sleep disordered
breathing as well as obesity which all are likely contributing
to acute presentation of respiratory failure. Patient was not
ordered for home BiPAP while on medical floor and this likely
contributed to his inability to maintain adequate ventilation.
Upon night of admission the patient was triggered for increasing
somnolence and tachypnea. Two separate ABGs showed a trend
toward
