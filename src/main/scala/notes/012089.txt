History of Present Illness:
64 year old woman with known rheumatic heart disease.
She has been more symptomatic lately, complaining of worsening
dyspnea on exertion and fatigue. Her most recent echocardiogram
showed severe aortic stenosis and regurgitation, moderate mitral
regurgitation with moderate to severe stenosis. She presents
today for surgical evaluation. In addition to her progressive
DOE, she also admits to two pillow orthopnea, persistent pedal
edema and intermittent palpitations. She denies chest pain,
syncope, and pre-syncope. It appears she has marked limitation
with routine ADL's.

dilated LV cavity. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. No atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal aortic
arch diameter. No atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending
aorta diameter.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with
borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The
mitral valve shows characteristic rhe
