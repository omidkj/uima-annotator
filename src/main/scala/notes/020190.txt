X-ray tibia-fibula [**2172-7-22**]:
FINDINGS: The images are slightly limited due to the splint.
There are
multiple surgical clips in the medial aspect of the leg from
prior vein
harvesting. There is a comminuted fracture of the proximal tibia
with
an oblique component in the shaft which is minimally displaced.
There is
also a fracture of the fibular neck with lateral displacement of
the head of
the fibula. Vascular calcifications are noted.

IMPRESSION: Fractures of the tibia and fibula.

[**9-26**]
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are
moderate-sized, bilateral pleural effusions with reactive
collapse/atelectasis. There is no evidence of pulmonary
embolism. There are mild increased septal lines and scattered
ground-glass opacities consistent with fluid overload. The aorta
is of normal caliber throughout the chest without evidence of
aneurysm or dissection. There are marked coronary artery
calcifications and wall calcifications within the aorta. The
airways are patent down to the segmental bronchi. An ET tube
terminates within the trachea. The NG tube courses below the
diaphragm into the stomach. There is a right subclavian CVL with
the tip terminating within the SVC. There are scattered,
non-pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism.

BONE WINDOWS: No rib fractures are seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, she was hypothermic at 95.6, BP 123/45, and 100%
on RA. ECG was unchanged from prior. Her pain was controlled
with morphine 2 mg IV q6h prn.
On [**7-24**], she was taken to the OR for an ORIF of her fracture.
In the OR, she received a total of 600 cc NS, versed,
succinylcholine, phenylephrine, metoprolol, glycopyrrolate,
morphine IV (6 mg), etomidate, fentanyl (200 mcg),
cisatracurium, neostigmine, dolasetron, and propofol.  Her EBL
was reported as minimal.  Her bp was in the 80s/40s and she was
begun on neosynephrine.  While in the PACU, she was also hypoxic
to the 60s for 25-30 minutes.  Her ABG at this time was
7.36/52/89.  CXR showed low inspired lung volumes but no clear
[**Month/Year (2) **] edema.  Because of her hypotension and hypoxia she was
transferred to the MICU at this point.
*
In the MICU the pt was changed from neosynephrine to levophed.
She had HD on [**7-25**].  During HD she became tachycardic to 150-170
with a drop in BP to 82/40.  BPs rose after 200cc fluid and 300
rinseback given. Her rhythm was determined to be atrial
tachycardia and she came out of it on her own. EKG post
hemodialysis showed ST depression in V3-V6?  Around this time
the patient was noted to have an enzyme leak with trop 2.54 (was
.34 before), Ck 2064 (was 306),  MB 127 (was 11).  Heparin drip
was started at that time.  On [**7-27**] the patient was witnessed to
aspirate jello.  On [**7-27**] the patient also had hemodialysis.
