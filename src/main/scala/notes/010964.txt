Chief Complaint:
Status Epilepticus

VP shunt tap

History of Present Illness:
  Mr. [**Known lastname 4882**] is a 20 year old man with severe traumatic brain
injury
in [**7-28**], now admitted for status epilepticus.  Initial injury
during roll-over MVA in [**7-28**], ejected from car, sustaining
subdural hematoma, skull fracture, SAH, with midline shift
requiring emergency hemicraniectomy for increased ICPs.  Given
severity of injury, he was on prophylactic levetiracetam,
although no record of clinical seizures and continuous EEG
monitoring for total of 6 days showed no electrographic
seizures,
but occasional right hemisphere and left frontal spikes.
Discharged to rehab in [**2164-8-19**].  Had right cranioplasty and VP
shunt in [**9-28**].  Was being tapered off Keppra because of sedation
(to 250mg TID).
  Mother reported that at rehab he followed some commands,
answered
yes/no questions, spoke few word phrases, and had been able to
sit, lift head, and stand with assistance.
  On [**1-19**] AM, was found to be unresponsive with posturing; given
Ativan 4mg and taken to [**Location (un) 1121**], where he continued to have
recurrent generalized seizures despite Ativan 10mg, Dilantin 1g,
Keppra 2g.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] later on [**1-19**], where had
continued right arm twitching, head deviation to right, eye
twitching, which improved with propofol infusion and resolved
with IV phenobarbital load.


Past Medical History:
Right subdural hematoma
multiple brain contusions
TBI
s/p VP shunt
L1 burst fracture
s/p PEG, G-tube feeds only
s/p Trach, now decanulated


Social History:
Has been at [**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 3597**].


Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
Initial exam:

Gen: Lying in bed, intubated/sedated
CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs
Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
Abd: +BS soft, nontender
Ext: warm, well perfused, no edema
Skin: G-tube site okay, old trach scars

Mental status: Intubated, sedated, does not open eyes, does not
follow commands.
CN: head appeared initially deviated toward right with facial
twitching and eye twitching vertically. With increased propofol,
only eye twitching, head midline. PERRL 1.5mm not reactive.
Motor exam: Initially with right hand twitching with stopped
with
increased propofol.  Has decerebrate extensor posturing and
rigidity in upper and lower extremities.
Sensory: Withdraws/postures lower extremities bilaterally to
noxious stimuli.
Reflexes: Brisk and symmetric at patella bilaterally. Unable to
elicit in UE due to tone/extensor posture.
Plantar response mute bilaterally.

Current exam:

Mental status: No spontaneous eye opening or eye opening to
command. NO eye movements to voice. Does not follow commands.
Opens eyes partially to noxious stimuli.
CN: pupils OD [**5-22**], OS [**6-22**], EOMI to doll's, corneals and gag
present.  Nearly continuous eyelid twitching.  Unable to see
palate secondary to increased tone in jaw.
Motor: extensor posturing bilateral arms with contractures,
increased extensor posturing to pain in UEs, triple flexion in
LEs to pain.
Reflexes absent in UEs, 3+ at knees.  Triple flexion to plantar
stimulation.

REPORTS:

EEG ([**2165-1-20**]): EEG gives evidence for a severe diffuse
encephalopathy
with the presence of persistent epileptiform activity
(PLEDs)over the left
central-temporal region.

EEG ([**2165-1-31**]):  This is an abnormal video EEG due to the
presence of left
frontal delta slowing which represents focal cerebral pathology.
It is
also abnormal due to the appearance of very rare left frontal
broad-based sharp waves which may represent epileptogenic
cortex. There
were two pushbutton activations, neither of which showed any
clinical or
electrical changes concerning for seizure. There were no
electrographic
seizures seen.

IMAGING:

LE Dopplers: Extensive deep venous thrombosis of the left lower
extremity extending from common femoral to popliteal veins.

CTA chest: Acute segmental pulmonary emboli involving the right
upper lobe anterior and apical segments and segmental and
subsegmental emboli involving the posterior basal right lower
lobe pulmonary arteries; Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis with
marked endobronchial secretions
within the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe,
consistent with
partial drowned lung. Additional foci of patchy airspace
consolidation in the remainder of the right lower lobe is
suspicious for superimposed aspiration or infection


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4882**] is a 20 year old man with severe traumatic brain
injury
in [**7-28**], now admitted for status epilepticus.

1) Status Epilepticus/Seizures: On [**1-19**] AM, was found to be
unresponsive with posturing; given Ativan 4mg and taken to [**Location (un) 12914**], where he continued to have recurrent generalized seizures
despite Ativan 10mg, Dilantin 1g, and Keppra 2g.  Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] Neuro ICU later on [**1-19**], where he had continued right arm
twitching, head deviation to right, eye twitching, which
improved with propofol infusion and resolved with IV
phenobarbital load. While in the Neuro ICU, he was initially
monitored on cEEG, which showed left central-temporal PLEDs. He
was maintained on Dilantin, Keppra and Phenobarb. The doses of
these medications were adjusted during hospital course. His
continued unresponsive to commnads during hospitalization was
thought to possibly be related to his [**Last Name (LF) 85127**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the plan
is to slowly taper this, while continuing his current doses of
Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Dilantin 200 mg q8h. With regards to his
Dilantin dosing, we have had to go up on the standing dose as
well as occasionally load him as his levels are frequently low
and should be monitored to make sure they remain therapeutic.
The Keppra dose was recently increased to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] to prevent
breakthrough seizures given the difficulty in maintaining a
therapeutic Dilantin level. His Phenobarb dose is currently at
60 mg [**Hospital1 **], with the plan to taper this to 45 mg [**Hospital1 **] next week
and then to call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the following week regarding further
medication adjustments. Please contact Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] regarding any
adjustments of seizure medications.

2) Respiratory: Initially intubated for airway protection in
setting of status epilepticus. Unable to be weaned off [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
tracheostomy was eventually performed and he is currently
maintaining good O2 sats while on 40% trach mask.

3) ID: He was initially spiking fevers, which was believed to be
due to his autonomic dysregulation, but cultures were sent and
he did have blood cultures (both centrally and peripherally)
positive for coag negative Staph. He was started on Vancomycin
for this and his central line was pulled as a possible source of
infection. After fevers were controlled, a PICC was placed for
access. While in the ICU, he also had a BAL, which ended up
growing Pseudomonas and coag + Staph. For the bacteremia, he was
started on a 14 day course of Vancomycin and for the pneumonia
he was started on a 14 day course of Ceftazadime. Repeat blood
cx have been negative and a repeat sputum cx only showed sparse
growth of Pseudomonas and Coag + Staph; this is likely
colonization and as per ID, there is no need to continue
antibiotics longer for this as long as there is no further
fevers or respiratory distress. To ensure the bactermia was not
related to a CSF infection given his VP shunt; Neurosurgery was
asked to tap the
