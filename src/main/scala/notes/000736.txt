Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular surgery A team on
[**2131-11-22**] for a left carotid endarterectomy with a Dacron patch.
There were no surgical complications and the patient was
hemodynamically stable in the PACU.  During the post-operative
course in the PACU, the patient develped a 3cm hematoma at the
incision site.  There was no blood drainage, gentle pressure was
applied for 10 minutes, and a pressure dressing was applied to
the wound.  The patient was transferred to the VICU.  During the
evening of POD0, the patient developed worsening dysarthria.
Neurology was consulted and a stat MRI Head with stroke protocol
was ordered. In addition, neurology recommended that the HOB
remain flat and to maintain a goal SBP 120-130 to maximize
cerebral perfusion pressure.  MRI and MRA of the brain showed a
R frontal parafalcine stroke (no acute changes).  On POD1, the
patient's speech was improved and he remained hemodynamically
stable.  The patient's POD1 HCT=25.0.  The patient received 2u
PRBCs.
