Chief Complaint:
chest tightness, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11622**] is a 27yo male with a history of Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**]
Syndrome, chronic trach with restrictive and obstructive lung
disease, multiple episodes of PNA including pseudomonal PNA, who
presents now with chest tightness and progressive dyspnea over
the past week.
.
Patient was hospitalized from [**Date range (3) 86063**] with sepsis, and
treated for PNA empirically with vanc/meropenem.  Was then
readmitted from [**Date range (3) 86064**], still on vanc/meropenem,
again for PNA, with mini-BAL culture at time positive for
pseudomonas resistant to meropenem and cefepime.  Patient
treated with tobramycin and ceftazadime for planned 21 day
course (starting [**2130-12-5**]), and was followed by ID in outpatient
setting following discharge.  Patient reports he had been doing
well since that time, with no interval infections.  Has been off
predinsone for his obstructive lung disease since [**Month (only) 1096**], but
states he has still been on bactrim daily.
.
Patient has h/o Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] syndrome, which is a rare autosomal
dominant congenital connective tissue disorder characterized by
severe and excessive bone resorption leading to osteoporosis and
bony deformities. Also has h/o restrictive lung disease
secondary to severe kyphoscoliosis, as well as component of
obstructive lung disease.  Has chrnic tracheotomy tube, and is
on 4L trach collar at home during day; on SIMV at night.
However, over the past week, patient has noted chest tightness
and worsening SOB.  No significant cough, though with cough
patient producing thick, "spongy" white mucous.  No fever or
chills.  Patient's vent requirements increased, and he has been
on vent both during day and at night over the past 1-2 days.
Reports symptoms are similar to those with previous pneumonias.
Given progressive symptoms, came to ED for evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 97.8  P 102 BP 133/88 R 20 O2 100%
sat on vent settings AC 400x20 PEEP 5, 35% FiO2. CXR suggestive
of right-sided infiltrate.  Patient was given cefepime and
levaquin and a 500cc bolus of NS, and admitted to ICU for
further evaluation and management.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient reports continued substernal
chest tightness, worse with inspiration, and shortness of
breath, which have gradually worsened over past week.  Denies
any significant cough at present.  No recent sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **]
recent choking with food or aspiration events he can recall.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. Rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. Occasional
constipation for which he takes miralax. No bloody stools.
Occasional heart palpitations. Chronic back pain, and increased
left knee pain. Also reports pruritis on back and left arm,
denies any other rashes.
(-) Denies fever, chills, headache, sinus tenderness. No changes
in vision. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or
changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies myalgias.

IMAGING:
[**2130-4-14**] CXR: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained. Midline tracheostomy tube is again noted. Severe
scoliosis and resulting asymmetry of the rib cage is again
noted, making evaluation quite suboptimal. No evidence of a
pleural effusion is seen. There is no definite focal
consolidation in the left lung, although it is difficult to
exclude in the right lung. There may be a right upper lobe
consolidation as seen on prior radiographs and acuity is
difficult to assess, although appears slightly increased
compared to the prior study. Opacity at the right lung base also
raises concern for infection and/or aspiration, although
difficult to assess.
.
[**2130-4-17**] Left Knee X-ray: There is no definite fracture or
dislocation. Severe joint space narrowing in the medial and
lateral compartments is noted.
