History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 69742**] is a 63 year-old with h/o CAD, CVA, OSA, asthma, and
dementia BIBA from home with worsening dyspnea, dizziness, and
confusion. Patient was at home today when he had a near-fall [**1-5**]
bilateral leg weakness. He feet like he was "wobbling on his
feet." Patient was walking out of the bathroom and he felt like
his legs were very weak and he felt dizzy. He fell onto the bed
and couldn't support his weight. As per his wife, he looked
pale, was having difficulty breathing, and his speech seemed
garbled and he looked "out of it." His wife checked his FS,
which was 115. He has had similar episodes in the past, but no
recent episodes over the past six months. He was admitted in
[**12/2135**] and [**1-/2136**] with similar presentations where his altered
mental status improved without intervention and etiology was not
identified.

In the ED, initial VS were: 96.7 50 117/51 18 98% 4L. Patient
had normal head CT. He had CXR that was concerning to ED for
pneumonia (although read by radiology as no pneumonia). He
received 0.2 of narcan since he takes tramadol at home. His
mental status did not improve with this. Patient received
levofloxacin for pneumonia. He had ABG given confusion, which
was 7.3/58/100. He was started on BiPAP given the primary
respiratory acidosis and pneumoia and was admitted to the MICU
because of the BiPAP. Of note, he had a repeat ABG prior to
transfer that was unchanged.

On arrival to the MICU, patient feels better. His weakness and
altered mental status have resolved. Patient does not recall the
episode, but knows only what his wife told him. He denies
weakness, confusion, difficulty speaking or swallowing, changes
in vision, numbness, tingling. He denies cough, dyspnea, fevers,
or chills. He feels back to baseline.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2135-1-18**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2135-1-18**]):
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.

PERTINENT IMAGING:

CT Head ([**2136-5-29**]): FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or large territorial infarction.
 The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, compatible with
age-related volume loss.  The basal cisterns appear patent and
there is preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.  No
fracture is identified.  The visualized paranasal sinuses,
mastoid air cells, middle ear cavities are clear.  The bilateral
ocular lenses have been replaced.
IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

CXR ([**2136-5-29**]) - FINDINGS:  Single supine AP view of the chest is
compared to previous exam from [**2136-3-5**] and [**2136-1-6**].  Low lung volumes are seen.  This is likely accounting for
apparent pulmonary bronchovascular congestion and increased
interstitial markings.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary process based on
the portable supine chest x-ray.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 year-old man with history of CAD, OSA, asthma, and dementia
presenting with somnolence, weakness, found to have respiratory
acidosis, transferred to ICU for BiPAP, then called out to the
floo on NC.

# Acute on Chronic Respiratory Acidosis: Etiology unclear.
Acidosis had resolved and patient was off BiPAP by the time he
arrived in the MICU.  Patient with history of asthma, but no
evidence of asthma exacerbation as patient has no wheezing, no
dyspnea.

# Confusion: Unclear etiology, but quickly resolved. Possibly
[**1-5**] hypercabia, but it was also possible that somnolence caused
the hypercarbia.  Also possibly secondary to medication side
effect as patient has some sedating medications (klonipin,
tramadol).  Of note, patient has had similar episodes in the
past without a clear etiology determined. All sedating
medications were held upon admission, and they were gradually
added on, first at
