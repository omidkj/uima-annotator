TEE

History of Present Illness:
79M CHF EF 25%, h/o left sided effusion s/p tap [**7-5**] (thought to
be [**3-4**] chf), CAD w/ NSTEMI [**7-5**], HTN, who presents after having
7-second pause while on Coreg 25mg; dose decreased, led to afib
with RVR; transferred for ? pacer for tachy-brady syndrome vs
also BiV placement given low EF and potential exacerbation of
CHF secondary to dysynchrony. Hypotensive requiring pressors,
elevated lactate. Intubated for pulmonary edema.
On [**1-20**], pt witnessed to go into asystole -> externally paced
with low BP requiring chest compressions, atropine and
epinephrine -> BP up and stable without compression -> emergent
temp wire placed at bedside. Pt taken to cath lab for R ht cath,
found to have PWCP 40 and IABP was placed. Pt resumed on heparin
drip given possible PCI to eval for ischemia. Patient with MAP
60-70's however anuric. Patient given IV lasix 80mg x1 with no
increase in UOP -> started on milrinone drip and transferred to
the CCU.

Pertinent Results:
[**2162-1-19**]:PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Again seen is stable
cardiomegaly. Mediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
There is minimal perihilar haziness, without any overt
prominence of the pulmonary vasculature. There is a probable
left pleural effusion. There is opacity in the left retrocardiac
area which may represent atelectasis.

IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly and probable left pleural
effusion. No definite CHF
.
ECHO [**2162-1-19**]:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is  seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Left
ventricular cavity is dilated, with severely depressed systolic
function. There is severe global hypokinesis, with relative
preservation of the basal inferolateral wall. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3.There is moderate global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis.
4.There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the
descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus. Severely depressed left
ventricular
systolic function. Moderately severe mitral regurgitation.

Compared to the previous report of [**2161-12-23**], the MR is more
severe and the RV  function appears worse.

[**2162-1-22**]: CXR
FINDINGS: A right subclavian Swan-Ganz catheter ends in the mid
right pulmonary artery. An endotracheal tube ends in
satisfactory position 4 cm above the carina. An NG tube passes
beyond view into the stomach. A pacemaking device overlies the
right chest with pacing electrodes in unchanged position
compared to [**2162-1-21**]. An intra-aortic balloon pump ends 1 cm
from the roof of the aortic arch. Moderate cardiomegaly is
unchanged. CHF is slightly improved compared to the previous
day. Left lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral effusions
(left greater than right) are unchanged. No pneumothorax is
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Improved CHF. Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis and
bilateral effusions.
2. The tip of an intra-aortic balloon pump ends 1 cm from the
roof of the aortic arch as previously communicated to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**2162-1-21**]

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo m with ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF: 15-25%), s/p NSTEMI,
hx of AFib, HTN recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for CHF exacerbation
and treated with lasix was readmitted after 7 second pause while
on COreg at rehab (digoxin was d/cd at this time). After
decreasing the coreg to 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **], he experienced RVR to
130s-140s. He received 10mg IV diltiazem with good rate control
and was referred here for ICD placement. On admission, his
troponin was up to 0.58 from 0.18 8 days PTA without EKG
changes.

On night of admission, patient was "Triggered" for increased HR
and decreased urine output. His rate responded to metoprolol
(4mg IV). He subsequently developed a 9 second pause on tele.
Pacer pads were placed and patient was evaluated for the CCU and
transferred for closer monitoring. EP was consulted and he was
started on heparin for ACS.

In the CCU:
# TACHY/BRADY
- In the CCU, patient developed asystole and required atropine
and chest compressions -> emergent pacer wire placed by EP.

WIth this asystolic episode, he went into cardiogenic [**Hospital1 **] and
[**Hospital1 **] liver and ARF on CRF.

## HYPOTENSION
- This was felt to be a mixed picture of cardiogenic [**Hospital1 **] and
sepsis
- He was placed on pressors, cultured and given empiric Abx
given rising WBC - Vancomycin and Aztreonam.  The question arose
of a possible biliary source given elevated LFTs.
.
# Cardiogenic [**Hospital1 **]:
- TTE showed 15-20% EF with 3+ MR with severe global
hypokinesis.
- WIth the development of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] emergent bedside TEE was
done which shoed 10-15% EF with 4+ MR and no clots were seen.
- He was placed on a balloon pump x 1 day -> Dcd on [**1-22**] along
with milrinone [**1-22**]
.
# CARDIAC ? ISCHEMIA
- Troponin elevated; 0.53 on admission and rose to 0.73. With
his worsening renal insufficiency, decreased GFR may have
accounted for his rise in troponins.
- Since this was Elevated beyond what is expected from CRI and
CHF. HOwever, his CKs were not elevated. He was on heparin for
Afib/Potential ACS.
- It was felt that ischemia was one potential source of his
cardiogenic [**Month/Year (2) **] and catheterization was to be considered if
patient stabilized.
.
# ARF on CRF
- Diuresing with lasix and diuril
- This was felt to be a bypro
