Service:  Trauma Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old
female who was an unrestrained passenger involved in a high
speed motor vehicle crash with positive loss of
consciousness, was found to be neurologically intact at the
scene. She was hemodynamically stable during transfer to the
Emergency Room.  The motor vehicle sustained large amount of
damage with significant intrusion.  The patient had prolonged
extrication time.  She complained of left lower extremity as
well as right hip pain.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Room in the C spine
collar and on the board.  It should also be noted that the
driver of the motor vehicle suffered a traumatic arrest at
the scene.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Room vitals signs
included temperature of 99.9, blood pressure 105/60, heart
rate 92.  She had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] come scale of 15.  Her pupils
were equal, round and reactive.  Her extraocular muscles were
intact.  She had a 7 cm laceration of her forehead which
involved her right eyelid and she had cervical tenderness as
well but no step-off.  Her lungs were clear.  There was no
crepitus.  Her heart was regular.  Her abdomen was soft,
distended but not tender.  She had a midline incision.  She
did not have any tenderness of her pelvis but did have right
hip tenderness and the gross deformity of her left tib/fib
area.  Her rectal exam, she had a mass in the rectum.  She
was guaiac negative.  Back exam, there was some tenderness at
the T1 to T3 area but no step-off.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission her white count was 12.1,
hematocrit was 32.6, platelet count 220,000, sodium 142,
potassium 3.6, chloride 111, CO2 20, BUN 17, creatinine 0.7,
glucose 167, INR 1.0, amylase 40.  Her tox screen was
negative.  Her C spine revealed a C6 fracture.  Her chest
x-ray revealed no effusions but she did have a questionable
widened mediastinum.  Her pelvis film showed the right
intertrochanteric fracture of her femur.  Her head CT was
negative.  Her C spine, CT showed a fractured C6 vertebral
body.  Her CT scan of chest was questionable for an aortic
tear but there was no extravasation.  Her CT of abdomen and
pelvis was negative.  Facial bone CT was negative.  X-ray of
left tib/fib area showed a left tibial plateau fracture.
X-ray of her right hip showed an intertrochanteric fracture
of the femur.  Her x-ray of her left ankle was negative.  On
review of her CT scan of her head, there was a question of a
small subarachnoid hemorrhage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on to the Trauma
Intensive Care Unit.  The pulmonary artery catheter was
placed to optimize her managing of her hemodynamic status.
Orthopedic surgery was consulted as well as cardiothoracic
surgery was consulted.  The patient was evaluated by the
cardiothoracic surgery service because of a questionable
contained aortic wall hematoma.  Neurosurgery service was
consulted for management of her C6 vertebral body fracture
and the decision was made to treat this with a hard collar
and no surgical intervention.  She had no evidence of cord
injury.  Orthopedic service was consulted for her fractures
and the decision was made to take the patient to the
operating room and repair her left tibial plateau fracture as
well as her right intertrochanteric fracture once she is
stable.  Her ICU course was further complicated by two brief
episodes of atrial fibrillation which responded to Lopressor.
The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout those two
episodes.  In order to further delineate her questionable
injury to her aorta, she underwent a thoracic angiogram which
was read by the cardiothoracic service and it was decided
that patient did not have any aortic injury.  Subsequently
the patient was intubated in the Intensive Care Unit using
fiberoptic intubation because of the planned procedures as
well as the need to undergo an MRI of her C spine as well as
having low oxygen saturation requiring an intubation.  She
subsequently underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram in
order to confirm that there was no aortic injury and that was
negative.  Because of two episodes of atrial fibrillation,
the patient was ruled out for MI.  Cardiology was consulted
and she was started on Lovenox for the episodes of atrial
fibrillation as well as DVT prophylaxis.  She was also seen
by the gastroenterology service because of the rectal mass
and the recommendation was made to undergo colonoscopy once
she is more stable and in order to evaluate the rest of her
colon and possible excision of this mass during colonoscopy
vs operative excision of the mass.  On [**2104-5-6**] the patient
was taken to the operating room and underwent an open
reduction internal fixation of left tibial plateau and right
femoral fracture.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and had no complications.  She was subsequently seen by the
physical therapy service.  It was subsequently noted that
patient had hemiparesis of her left upper extremity.  CVA as
well as aortic dissection was suspected.  The patient
underwent an MRI of her head which revealed multiple embolic
CVAs.  She then underwent an angiogram of her carotid
arteries which was negative for dissection.  The neurology
service was consulted as well and her left sided weakness was
attributed to be due to embolic CVAs as dissection was ruled
out by an arteriogram.  The source was suspected to be
cardiac or fat emboli due to the two episodes of atrial
fibrillation which were short-term as well as her orthopedic
surgeries.  The patient was then anticoagulated.  An attempt
was made to extubate the patient.  She failed extubation and
was reintubated due to respiratory distress.  Subsequently
there was a second attempt of extubation made which patient
did not tolerate as well and her sputum cultures were
positive for MRSA.  She was started on Vancomycin and
reintubated.  She received a full course of Vancomycin and
subsequently was afebrile with normal white blood cell count.
Her sputum contained pseudomonas as well and she was treated
with a full course of Ceftazidime for pseudomonas infection.
Her central lines were subsequently discontinued and the PICC
line was placed for future IV access.  On [**2104-5-16**] a
percutaneous tracheostomy as well as gastrostomy tubes were
placed.  The patient was subsequently weaned from ventilator
support and now remains on a trach collar and she is
tolerating full tube feeds of Impact.  The patient was
therapeutic on Coumadin but due to change in Coumadin dosing,
her INR was low in the 1.3 range and she was started on
Lovenox to maintain anticoagulation.  Patient was
subsequently screened and accepted to rehab.  She was seen by
the speech and language service and a PMV valve was placed
which she tolerated and was able to speak.  On [**5-23**] the
patient was started on Kefzol due to some drainage at her
right thigh incision area.  The patient will be transferred
to rehab in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Impact with fiber tube feeds at 60 cc
per hour, Roxicet when needed, Haldol when needed, Lasix 20
mg [**Hospital1 **], Coumadin dose pending PT and INR, regular insulin
sliding scale, Albuterol and Atrovent nebs, Lopressor 75 mg
per G tube [**Hospital1 **] and Colace 100 mg per G tube [**Hospital1 **] as well as
Lovenox.  She will also be on a 10 day course of Keflex 500
mg qid, first day [**5-23**].

Final recommendations from the orthopedic service will be non
weight bearing left lower extremity with a knee immobilizer,
pivot right lower extremity, discontinue the sutures on [**5-28**] and follow-up with orthopedics, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 13469**], on [**6-9**].  The
patient will also need to follow-up with gastroenterology or
general surgery to further evaluate her rectal mass as well
as with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] from the neurosurgery service regarding
the fracture of her C6 vertebral body.
