Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2126-1-16**] Endovascular Stent Repair

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] is a 72 year old male who underwent a type A aortic
dissection repair and pericardial aortic valve replacment in
[**2122-7-9**]. Since that time, he has been followed by
surveillance CT scans. His most recent CT scan was from [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2124**] which was notable for an increase of the size of the false
lumen at the level of aortic arch and azygos arch, measuring 5.2
cm, compared to the prior study, which measures 3.8 cm. The CT
scan also showed a persistent dissection starting from the
superior aspect of the graft extending all the way through the
left iliac artery. There was also a dissection of the right in
the innominate artery, with extension of thrombus into the false
lumen. Based on the increase in the size of false lumen of
aortic arch, immediate clinical and surgical attention was
recommended. At time of admission, he was complaining of
increasing fatigue. He denied chest pain, DOE, palpitations,
orthopnea, PND, pedal edema, lightheadedness and syncope. He
wasadmitted several days prior to surgical intervention for
routine preoperative workup, reversal of Warfarin and
heparinzation.

[**2126-1-16**] Intraop TEE: Pre CPB: Descending thoracic aorta is
dilated and a dissection flap is visualized origination in the
arch and continuing into the descending thoracic aorta. There ia
a larger false lumen with hematoma and a smaller true lumen with
flow on color flow Doppler. A tube graft is visualized in the
ascending aortic positon, no abnormal compression or flow
pattern is seen in the ascendin gaortic grraft. The left atrium
is markedly dilated. The left atrium is elongated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the
left atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the
left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the right atrium. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic
root The descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. The
descending thoracic aorta is markedly dilated. A mobile density
is seen in the aortic arch consistent with an intimal
flap/aortic dissection. A mobile density is seen in the
descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. The aortic wall is thickened consistent with an
intramural hematoma. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Post CPB: Preserved LV systolic function.
Mild to moderate MR. Mild to moderate TR and mildly depressed RV
systolic function. NO other change.

[**2126-1-21**] LENIS: Negative for proximal deep venous thrombosis
bilateral lower extremities.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 410**] was admitted and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation. Workup was unremarkable and he was maintained on
intravenous Heparin. On [**1-16**], the cardiac and vascular
services performed an endovascular stent graft repair to aortic
arch and descending aorta along with reimplantation of the left
subclavian, inominate, right and left commom carotids and
femoral to axillary bypass graft. For further surgical details,
please see seperate dictated operative note. Following the
operation, he was brought to the CSRU. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He weaned from
inotropic support without difficulty. He maintained stable
hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
two. Warfarin was resumed. He was intermittently transfused with
packed red blood cells to maintain hematocrit near 30%. On
postoperative day five, the hematology service was consulted for
new onset purpura over the ankles bilaterally associated with
pain. Given concern for Coumadin induced skin necrosis, HIT, low
grade DIC and/or cholesterol emboli, Warfarin was stopped.
Vitamin K and FFP was given to replace coagulation factors. All
Heparin products continued to be withheld, and intravenous
Argatroban was initiated. A lower extremity ultrasound was
negative for deep vein thrombosis. HIT assay was negative for
PF4 Heparin antibodies. Daily coags were monitored closely along
with platelet count and fibrinogen levels. Over several days,
his purpura lesions improved as did his pain. Given the slow
rise in platelet count(dropped as low as 89K) and rise in
fibrinogen, it most likely appeared to be low grade DIC. Low
dose Warfarin was eventually resumed as Argatroban was
continued.  Chest tubes were eventually removed over several
days. He was maintained on Amiodarone and remained mostly in a
normal sinus rhythm. With medical therapy and physical therapy,
he continued to make clinical improvements. On post-op day #11,
the patient's foley catheter was successfully removed after
multiple failures to void. On post-op day #13, based on the
recommendations of the hematology service, the argatroban was
stopped, and lovenox was started. The vancomycin was also
stopped, and coumadin administration was continued with a
therapeutic INR. On post-op day #14, the patient was discharged
home in stable condition.
