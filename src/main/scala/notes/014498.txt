ADDENDUM TO PREVIOUS DICTATION

HOSPITAL COURSE:
On [**2102-6-9**] the patient was feeling well and had no
changes in his status.  His issues.
ID:  He had one fever spike on [**2102-6-9**] to 101.3 but his
clinical status did not change.  He continued a course of
Ambazone which ended on [**2102-6-13**] and per the ID team once this
is done he is to be on Itraconazole 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. for
ten weeks and then he should change to 200 mg q day for his
life.  He had a pneumovax and he should be on Azithromycin
1250 mg q week and on Bactrim one double strength day and he
should follow-up in [**Hospital **] clinic depending on where he would
like to go.  He had a lip ulcer which healed and while on the
Ambazone he had multiple laboratory abnormalities in his K
and potassium and we repleted him as needed.  He should be
discharged on GCSF once his white count gets to 10 and we
will check with ID to see if that can happen earlier than
that.

2.  Cardiology.  The patient had on routine echo a tympanode
physiology was found.  They followed his pulses paradoxus,
his clinical picture and cardiology recommended that the best
way to follow the effusion is clinically in light of the fact
his blood pressures stayed relatively high, his systolics
never dropped below 140 that he probably had no need to
follow his pericardial effusion other than with his clinical
status and he was asymptomatic with this pericardial
effusion.  His pulses were around six on [**2102-6-11**].

3.  Hematology.  Karposi sarcoma.  The patient has not been
on ongoing treatment for that until now, he should follow-up
with [**Hospital **] Clinic or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] here once his other
issues are resolved.

4.  Renal.  His creatinine continued to improve throughout
his stay, was down to 1.5 on [**2102-6-11**].

5.  FEN.  The patient was on TPN until [**2102-6-12**] when nutrition
recommended oral diet.  He was taking about 75% of his
required calories orally and they recommended encouraging
this p.o. intake and using his gut since there is on reason
to not use his gut.  He is on a soft diet with Neutra shakes
t.i.d. and beginning to eat well and are covering him as far
as his fingersticks with insulin and his family has requested
that he go back to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] because it is near his
home and because it would be easier for them to visit him
there so we have arranged for transfer to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **]
on [**2102-6-13**] pending availability of the bed.

The rest of the dictation as is already noted.  No additional
diagnosis and the additional medicine changes since then are
Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. q day, Azithromycin 1250 mg q
week, Regular insulin sliding scale with fingerstick checks
and per Nutrition a multivitamin p.o. q day, Vitamin C 500 mg
p.o. b.i.d. and Zinc Sulfate 225 mg q day.

The patient will be transferred when bed is available.
