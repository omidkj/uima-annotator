None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 89 year old male with h/o recent sepsis unclear
source, fungemia, hemorrhagic prostatitis, primary progressive
aphasia, and AF, presenting from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with T [**Age over 90 **]F and
SBP 90s. Mr. [**Known lastname 9834**] has been managed at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for the
last 3 weeks on vancomycin and flagyl for MRSA and enterococcal
UTI and prostatitis with likely prostatic abscesses. Plan at d/c
was to continue vanc until [**2154-7-16**] and Flagyl until [**2154-7-10**]. He
was due to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **] clinic as an outpatient on [**7-10**]. He
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED after a measured temp of 102F with SBP in
90s and AF with RVR to 140s.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T: 102.F, BP: 140/84, HR: 112, RR:
26, SaO2: 96% RA. He was given 3L NS, and tylenol and ASA for
fever. Initial w/u demonstrated WBC 20.6 with no left-shift. His
CXR showed a vague RLL opacity more consistent with atelectasis
than infiltrate, and UA was grossly positive, with >50wbc, pos
nitr, mod LE. An abdomen/pelvis CT was done, which showed
interval improvement in prostatic fluid collection, no focal
intraabdominal fluid collections, and stable bilateral pleural
effusions. He was given a dose of Levofloxacin 750mg IV along
with his vanc and flagyl, and admitted to the MICU for further
management.

STUDIES:
CXR:
SINGLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 17:00: The lungs are
well expanded and there is a focal increase in opacity at the
right lung base, partially obscuring the right heart border.
This could represent confluent vessels or atelectasis and is
unlikely to represent pneumonia. The remaining lungs are clear,
without pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged and there is no hilar
or mediastinal enlargement. Soft tissue and bony structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Vague right lung base opacity more likely
atelectasis than pneumonia. Recommend dedicated PA and lateral
radiographs if clinically feasible.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis:
FINDINGS: At the lung bases, there are small bilateral pleural
effusions and associated atelectasis. The heart is normal in
size, with a single-lead pacemaker terminating in the right
ventricle. There is no pericardial effusion.
In the abdomen, the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, stomach,
spleen, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small and large
bowel are unremarkable. The patient has a G-tube. Mild
perinephric stranding is stable and nonspecific. The adrenal
glands are unremarkable. There is no free air or free fluid in
the abdomen. Previously noted hydroureter has resolved.
In the pelvis, the prostate gland remains enlarged, and the
hypoattenuating fluid collection appears slightly smaller. The
bladder again demonstrates wall thickening, although it is
nondistended due to the presence of a Foley catheter. Minimal
fat stranding anterior to the bladder is unchanged, and a
bladder diverticulum is again noted. The rectum and sigmoid
colon are unchanged, again demonstrating multiple diverticula
without evidence of diverticulitis. There is no free fluid in
the pelvis.
No mesenteric or pelvic lymph nodes meet CT criteria for
pathologic
enlargement. In the scrotum, bilateral hydroceles are noted.
For evaluation of osseous structures reveals stable degenerative
changes in the lumbar spine, without fracture or bony lesion.
Soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Further slight decrease in size of persistent prostatic fluid
collection.
2. No focal fluid collection in the abdomen or pelvis to suggest
abscess.
3. Stable bladder wall thickening of unclear significance.
4. Stable prostate enlargement.
5. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
6. Stable bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**7-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening pneumonia along with a new left parapneumonic
effusion
.
CXR [**7-13**]: Radiodense guidewire of right PICC terminates at
expected location of junction of superior vena cava and right
atrium. There is otherwise no substantial change since the
recent radiograph.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old male with recent sepsis unclear source, prostatic
abscess on vanc/flagyl, Atrial fibrillation, presenting with
temperature of 102F and SBP 90s, now hemodynamically stable and
afebrile. Has grown MRSA and vanc-sensitive enterococcus in
past.  Now with Pseudomonas in Urine.
.
# Pneumonia: Patient presented with new onset fevers while on
Vancomycin/Flagyl.  He was diagnosed with Pneumonia based on
CXR, leukocytosis and fevers.  Leukocytosis has improved s/p
Levo, Cipro and one dose of Dapto, now on standing Levo.
Patient now clnically improved while on Levofloxacin.  Per ID,
given clinical improvement will continue with current regimen.
Patient to complete 7 day course of Levofloxacin last day on
[**7-17**].  Last day of Vancomycin is [**2154-7-22**] to complete a 6 week
course.  Flagyl was stopped as he has completed a 4 week course.
 Patient is to follow up with Infectious Disease as an
outpatient.  Per ID, patient is to be started on Bactrim DS once
daily for suppressive UTI therapy, which should begin on [**2154-7-23**]
- PICC line placed prior to discharge and okay to use.
.
# Urology: Consulted regarding recurrent urinary infections.
Plan for outpatient follow-up and consideration of diversion to
avoid indwelling foley in future.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: In Atrial fibrillation with RVR on
admission now in rate control. Anticoagulation on hold given
recent hemorrhagic prostatitis.  He is to continue on Metoprolol
and Diltiazem.  To consider restarting as outpatient once
infectious issues have resolved.
.
# Hypertension: continue home meds
.
# BPH: continue finasteride
.
# Primary progressive aphasia : continue home aricept, modafinil
