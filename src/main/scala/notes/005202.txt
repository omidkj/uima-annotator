History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104510**] is a 84yo F with history of COPD and CHF who was
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for inguinal abscess drainage
with sepsis, complicated by GI bleed, to [**Hospital1 599**] senior health
last Tuesday. She was doing very well at rehab until Sunday [**8-3**],
when her daughter noted that her breathing seemed labored and
that she seemed slightly "loopy" and was much weaker than she
had previously been. She had a low grade fever. Patient
complained of SOB and total body weakness. She had no CP, cough,
dysuria, or melena/BRBPR.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were 99.2, 66, 149/32, 24, 100%
NRB. Her CXR showed volume overload with signs of heart failure.
 She received nebulizers, 20mg IV lasix, and 500mg IV
azithromycin and was admitted to medicine.
.
On the medicine floor, she arrived on 2L NC and was found to be
saturating in the mid 80%s. The patient improved with a
non-rebreather and nebs. A couple hours later, she was very
somnolent and her ABG showed 7.23/84/98/37.  She was started on
CPAP, and MICU transfer was initiated for respiratory distress.
.
Upon evaluation in the MICU, she was initially somnolent but
then awakened repeatedly saying "I am a DNR but I don't want to
die."

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**8-5**] Urine Cx: Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to bactrim
.
IMAGING:
[**8-6**] CXR: The patient is in mild interstitial edema, unchanged.
Multifocal appearance of the left basal opacity might be
worrisome for underlying infectious process. Mediastinal
widening is substantial, unchanged as compared to prior
radiographs, with slightly more engorged right upper mediastinum
most likely reflecting vascular engorgement. Followup of this
area after diuresis is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104510**] is a very pleasant 84yo woman with history of COPD
and CHF who presented with confusion and was found to be in
hypercarbic respiratory distress.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Her somnolence was likely
related to underlying hypercarbia from her COPD as well as
potential worsening from a brief period on a nonrebreather with
decreased respiratory drive.  Although she is a documented
DNR/DNI, she expressed that she would like to be intubated if
needed, and repeatedly said that she wants to live.  We also
suspected that a component of her respiratory distress was
related to a CHF exacerbation.  As she is moving air well on
exam, we do not suspect she is having clear COPD exacerbation at
this time, so will hold on abx and steroids. She was given a
trial of BiPAP, 20mg of Lasix, albuterol/ipratropium nebs, and
her ABG's steadily improved. At the time of discharge, she was
stable and was satting in the high 90%'s on nasal cannula.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Her CXR is
consistent with volume overload, which is likely related to
underlying heart failure and being discharged off of lasix given
her elevated creatinine of 2.0.  She made a good amount of urine
to the 20mg IV lasix given in the ED (approx 2.5L over 24 hrs),
and her fluid overload appears to have improved along with her
respiratory status.
.
# PUD: She had a recent GI bleed with EGD showing duodenal ulcer
while in the SICU last month. She was continued on her PPI and
sucralfate.
.
# Recent acute kidney injury: Her admission creatinine is 2.0
from previous baseline of 1.4 at beginning of prior admission,
with peak of 2.7 in [**7-13**].  Her elevated Cr may have been due to
poor forward flow; we renally dosed her medications, avoid
nephrotoxins, and trended her creatinine which improved to 1.4
on [**8-7**].
.
# Positive U/A: Her UA was mildly positive (and essentially
identical to prior on [**7-12**]) with a previously negative urine cx.
 Her urine Cx from [**8-5**] showed Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to
bactrim, and so she was started on a 5-day course of Bactrim DS
PO BID.
.
# Gout: This was an inactive issue, and we continued her on
renally dosed allopurinol.
.
