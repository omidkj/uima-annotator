Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion/Fatigue/Chest pain

[**2133-7-28**]:
1.Aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]

History of Present Illness:
This 59 year old asymptomatic female with extensive past medical
history, including probable endocarditis complicated by stroke,
brain abscess and intracranial hemorrhage requiring a
craniotomy. Also underwent wedge resection for non-small cell
lung cancer in [**2131**]. She was cured of this and did not require
chemotherapy or radiation. She has been undergoing routine
echocardiograms to follow her valvular disease sinceit was
diagnosed in [**2129**] with the most recent showing severe aortic
stenosis, moderate aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral
regurgitation. Given the progression or her disease, she has
been referred for valve surgery.


Past Medical History:
Endocarditis, septic emboli, probable L parietal and L frontal
brain abcesses, cerebellar infarction, b/l vertebral artery
spasm, Afib with RVR

Social History:
Social history is significant for smoking 1 ppd. EtOH - [**1-29**]
drinks daily. Prior to rehab, worked as a waitress and lived
with her husband at home who also smokes.


Family History:
Father died at 76 and mother who died of alzheimer's in her 80s.
One sister who is healthy in her 40s.

 Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA. No
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good
(>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV systolic function
likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Normal RV systolic
function.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending
aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Critical AS (area
<0.8cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Mild valvular MS (MVA
1.5-2.0cm2). Due to co-existing AR, the pressure half-time
estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true
area. Severe (4+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Mild [1+]
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Mild PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
trace-mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.8cm2 by VTI and
2.5cm2 by P1/2t). Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the
pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an
OVERestimation of true mitral valve area. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is systolic flow blunting/reversal
in the pulmonary veins.
There is no pericardial effusion.

POSTBYPASS
The patient is A-paced on an epinephrine infusion.
