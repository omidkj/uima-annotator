Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
admitted for VT ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. VT ablation
2. Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
59 y/o man with hx. AMI in [**2094**] with resulatant apical aneurysm
and VT, EF 17%, s/p amio, ICD with ATP pacing, VT ablation [**2119**],
admitted for repeat VT ablation [**3-13**] recurrent shocks on [**2122-4-22**]
who had only non-clinical VT inducible in the EP lab today, and
this was poorly tolerated hemodynamically. He underwent multiple
shocks to get out of this rhythm and was hypotensive, beleived
[**3-13**] myocardial "stunning" of multiple shocks. He was started on
neosynephrine for BP support, and left intubated, admitted to
the CCU for monitoring overnight. Plan is to start ASA, Warfarin
s/p ablation attempt and given apical aneurysm. Device was
reprogrammed to previous settings.

Past Medical History:
AMI [**2094**], as above
DM

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse. The patient resides
in [**Country 2451**], but works in [**State 2690**] part of the year. He stays with his
brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 54432**] in [**State 2690**].

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 105/59 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 83
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 12 breaths/min.
Intubated, sedated.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 7 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
[**2122-5-12**] FOCUSED TRANS-THROACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2122-5-14**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION: COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LAD was
occluded in the proximal segment.  The LCx had no angiographic
evidence of flow-limiting disease. The RCA had an 80% stenosis
in the mid, small posterolateral branch. 2.  Resting
hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling
pressure with a RVEDP of 17 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 30 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with PA
pressure of 56/33 mmHg. Systemic arterial pressure was normal at
130/84 mmHg.  There was no transaortic valve gradient on
pullback of the catheter from the LV to the aorta. FINAL
DIAGNOSIS: 1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Marked
elevation of filling pressures. 3. Moderate pulmonary arterial
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 54433**] is a 59 year old male with a past medical history of
acute myocardial infarct approximately 30 years ago with an EF
of 10 %, VT with ICD and ATP who was transferred to the CCU
after attempted VT ablation. In the VT lab, patient required
multiple shocks, became hypotensive post-procedure, was admitted
to the CCU for monitoring.
.
1. VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA: The patient has had multiple
episodes of V-TACH. He underwent VT ablation, but his VT was not
induced. He did develop unstable VT in the EP lab requiring
multiple shocks. He became hypotensive after the procedure
requiring pressor support and fluid resuscitation. He was
quickly weaned off of pressors upon arrival to the CCU. He
remained intubated until the day after his procedure. He
continued to have intermittent episodes of VT recorded on
telemetry. However, he did not require further defibrillation by
his ICD. He was started on anti-coagulation therapy for known
apical aneurysm and post-VT ablation and this should be
continued for 2 months. He is returning to [**Location (un) 36413**] for 2 weeks
where Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9723**] will follow his INR. He will then return to [**Country 2451**]
where his PCP will monitor his INR.
.
2. CHF: The patient has poor cardiac ejection fraction at
baseline. He did experience moderate symptoms of volume overload
after being volume resuscitated for hypotension. He responded
well to diuresis and tolerated self-extubation well. His home
medication regimen was re-started when the patient was deemed
hemodynamically stable.
.
3. CAD: The patient underwent cardiac catheterization during
this admission to evaluate for a potential ischemic source of
his VT. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated 80% lesion in the
RCA and total occlusion of the proximal LAD. No intervention was
performed. He was continued on ASA and beta-blocker. The patient
would likely benefit from monitoring of his lipid profile and
the addition of a statin product to his medical regimen. It is
unclear whether he has received lipid lowering therapy in the
past.
.
4. DM II: The patient was managed with sliding scale insulin. He
was instructed to restart his home dose of Glyburide upon
discharge.
