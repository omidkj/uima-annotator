CXR:
FINDINGS: A right subclavian line is in place, with tip crossing
the midline and terminating in the left upper mediastinum. A
left-sided pacemaker is in unchanged position, with dual
electrodes. The electrode leads also course to the left of the
mediastinum. These findings are suggestive of a left-sided SVC.
The heart size and mediastinal contours are unchanged, with mild
cardiomegaly. There is bibasilar atelectasis and a small right
pleural effusion. The left costophrenic angle is excluded from
the radiograph. Minimal haziness of the interstitial markings,
consistent with mild congestive heart failure. The osseous
structures appear unchanged. No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION
1. Right subclavian venous access catheter with tip terminating
in the upper
portion of a left-sided SVC. No pneumothorax.
2. Mild cardiomegaly and mild congestive heart failure, slightly
improved.
Small right pleural effusion.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis.

EKG:
Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V delay. Left atrial abnormality.
Left
bundle-branch block. Since the previous tracing of [**2177-8-13**] atrial
pacing is not
evident.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF: The patient was admitted electively for ultrafiltration
as he was chronically total body overloaded with fluid.
Approximately 13 liters of fluid were removed with the CHF
solutions ultrafiltration machine over the course of 2 days. His
diuretics were held but toprol was continued. He was not on an
ACE due to renal dysfunction.

2. HTN: The patient was hypertensive while hospitalized. He was
on two separate dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as an
outpatient. Both of these were discontinued, and hydralazine was
started instead as an afterload reducing [**Doctor Last Name 360**] since an ACE was
contraindicated.

3. CRI: worsening over last months. His creatinine worsensed
from 3.6 at admission to 4.3 at discharge. Renal service was
consulted, who recommended close follow up and possible
dialysis.

4. DMII: patient was on a sliding scale involving 70/30 insulin
sliding scale in the morning and NPH sliding scale in the
evening. This was continued along with his prandin.

5. anemia: The patient had chronic anemia likely [**1-6**] CRI. He is
on outpatient epogen at home. His hemoglobin was stable.

6. Peripheral neuropathy: His amitriptyline and neurontin were
continued.

7. Raynauds: His nifedipine was discontinued due to possible
exacerbation of CHF from nifedipine.
