Chief Complaint:
Angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2127-6-23**]:

History of Present Illness:
74 year old female with cardiac risk factors of obesity,
hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes who has had anginal
symptoms for about 2 years. After emigrating to the United
States from [**Country 3587**], she had an echo stress test on
[**2126-12-30**] that was negative in the setting of very low work load.
She has described her symptoms as mid upper back pain that
radiates to right chest wall, under right breast, and right
shoulder. Onset is with exertion and at rest and occasionally
occurs with shortness of breath. This pain has woken her at
night and sometimes occurs when she sleeps on her right side or
after
walking. She describes symptoms onset is faster with walking and
resolves with rest. With her symptoms increasing over the past
few months was referred for catheterization. She was found to
have three vessel disease and is now referred to cardiac surgery
for revascularization.

Cardiac Catheterization: Date:[**2127-6-18**]     Place:[**Hospital1 18**]
LMCA: 20% proximal-mid
LAD: Severe 80% focal mid LAD stenosis
LCX: severely and diffusely diseased system with CTO off the AV
groove LCX and serial severe focal disease in hte single OM
branch. Some of the LCX distribution vesels fill late via mostly
Right to left collaterals and fewer left to right collaterals
RCA: 80% ostial disease with reasonable proximal-mid and distal
vessel. The RPDA and PLV have serial focal tight lesions.
RA=15
PCW=19
PA=35/13
Cardiac Echocardiogram:
Stress echo on [**2126-12-30**]
Normal LV wall thickness and function. no AS, no AR, no MR and
no
TR. Showed limited functional exercise capacity. No EKG of 2D
echo evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved low workload.
Normal hemodynamic response to exercise. LVEF is >=60%

[**2127-6-23**]:
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
Intact thoracic aorta.
No new valvular findings.

CXR:
[**2127-6-27**]: Post-operative mediastinal widening has resolved.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are new with newly apparent
and bibasilar atelectasis left greater than right has not
cleared. There is no pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.
[**2127-6-18**]: Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.
Eventration
of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged. The lungs are clear
without focal
consolidation. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.
The aorta is
mildly tortuous. Hilar contours are normal. No pleural effusion
or
pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2127-6-23**] where the patient underwent an urgent
coronary artery bypass graft x3:  Saphenous vein grafts to left
anterior descending artery, obtuse marginal and right coronary
arteries. See operative note for full details. Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.
Both beta blocker and Lasix were both titrated.  She was
confused with Percocet was changed to Ultram with no further
confusion.The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.

Respiratory: aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs, incentive
spirometer and diuresis her oxygen requirements improved to
saturations of 91-95% room air.

Cardiac: hemodynamically stable sinus rhythm 70-90's without
ectopy.  Blood pressure 100-120 stable. ASA and statin were
continued. ACE will be restarted as an outpatient once Blood
pressure will tolerate.

GI: PPI, bowel regime with good effect.  She tolerated a
diabetic diet.

Renal: CRI baseline 1.5-18. Renal function remained stable with
good urine output.
Diuresis continued preop wt:158 lbs, discharge wt:157.7.
Electrolytes were replete as needed.

Endocrine: Blood sugars well control 95-130's on Metformin XL
500 mg daily and regular insulin sliding scale. A1C 5.8

ID: leukocytosis pk 16 pan-cultures were negative, no fevers,
discharge WBC 10.6

Neuro: awake alert oriented. Pain well control with
acetaminophen and Ultram 50 prn.

Disposition: she was followed by physical therapy, ambulated
with a rolling walker. She continued to make steady  progress
and was discharged to [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]
