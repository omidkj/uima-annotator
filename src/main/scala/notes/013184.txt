Chief Complaint:
melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy with biopsy on [**2100-11-1**]


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M retired internal medicine physician, w/Hx of GIB while
on ASA X2, history of coronary artery disease s/p stent 9 wks
ago, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, who presents with a 1d H/o melena. Pt has been on
Plavix and ASA since recent stent ([**7-27**]).  Pt reports that 1d
PTA he had one mahogany colored stool, (guiaic pos per pt) early
in the day, and then after having lunch and juice had a dark,
tarry stool, also guiaic pos per pt report.  No abdominal pain.

ECHO [**2100-10-28**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal anterior septum, apex and
distal anterior wall. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2100-2-5**], left ventricular function has
deteriorated

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2100-10-30**] 1:45 PM
There is slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with
cardiomegaly, indicating mild congestive heart failure. The
patient has prior CABG and median sternotomy. Pacemaker leads
remain in place. No pneumothorax is seen. A nasogastric tube
terminates in the gastric antrum.


[**2100-11-1**] report date [**2100-11-3**] "Esophageal" polyp, biopsy:
Gastric-type hyperplastic polyp with focal ulceration.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male physician with past medical history
significant for two upper gastrointestinal bleeds in past
secondary to aspirin use presents after two dark stools, both
guiaic positive, hemodynamically stable, repeat hematocrit near
baseline. Currently on ASA and Plavix.
.
1. Gastrointestinal bleed- In the ED, hct 34-->26.7 (recent
baseline was 30-32). Pt was transferred to the ICU, when
hematocrit drop was noted. INR, platelets appropriate. He was
given 2L NS and protonix IV. NGL was positive and cleared after
250cc NS. GI was consulted. Vital signs remained stable so
patient was transferred to floor. On [**11-1**], GI performed an EGD
showing gastritis, large gastric polyp s/p bx. Bleeding was
thought to be most likely from gastritis and/or polyps. Probably
exacerbated by recent anticoagulation with ASA and plavix.
Serial hematocrits were fairly stable within range. Pt was
restarted on the plavix following his EGD. After discussion with
attending, patient was also started back on ASA 81 mg daily as
pt had stent in left main only nine weeks ago. Continued on
protonix [**Hospital1 **].
.
2. [**Name (NI) 4964**] Pt's last echo was significant for a LVEF of 25%.
Monitored closely for fluid overload. Euvolemic on exam with no
evidence of symptomatic HF. Lungs clear and no edma. Admission
CXR clear.
.
3. [**Name (NI) **] Pt is s/p LM stent nine weeks ago. Doing well since that
time in sense that he has not had any more angina. Patient was
restarted on plavix after EGD and restarted on ASA prior to
discharge. While on the floor, patient was on tele and continued
on beta blocker and ACEi as he was well compensated and not
actively bleeding.
.
4. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency. Baseline creatinine per
pt between 1.6 and 2.9. Was elevated to 2.3 on admission most
likely from prerenal state. Down to 2.0 prior to discharge.
.
5. Paroxysmal atrial fib- Stable with good rate
