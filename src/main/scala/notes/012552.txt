Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Mild-moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. Moderately
depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Trivial MR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears

PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior, inferolateral and lateral apical to
mid hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 5. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine

1. Biventricular function is unchanged. Focal WMAs are unchanged
2. Aorta is intact post decannulation
3. Other findings are unchanged
