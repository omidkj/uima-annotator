CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
[**Numeric Identifier 111553**] - CCC *** PRELIMINARY ***
PROCEDURE DATE: [**2139-1-3**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
STEMI,
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild elevation of right and left filling pressures with
preserved CI.
3. Acute MI likely due to the mid LAD lesion with possible
multivessel
acute ischemia.
4. Successful stenting of the mid LAD, Proximal D1 and mid CX.
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant
patient revealed three vessel CAD. The LMCA was angiographically
normal. The LAD had a 90% occlusion after D1 with slightly
decreased
flow distal to this lesion. The D1 had a ostial 60% lesion and
proximal
90% lesion. The LCX [**Male First Name (un) **] mid occlusion after OM1 with faint
filling of
distal vessel. The RCA had moderate disease with 70%
posteroloateral
branch and 60% mid PDA.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mild elevation of right and
left
filling pressures with RA of 10 and PCWP of 15mmHG. The cardiac
index
was preserved at 2.56. There was very mild pulmonary
hypertension.
The systemic blood pressure was normal at 118/59. There were no
arrhythmias during the case.
3. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 08mm Voyager balloon and
stenting
using a 2.5 X 08mm Cypher stent of the mid LAD with lesion
reduction
from 90% to 0%.
4. successful predilation using 2.0 X 08mm Voyager balloon and
stenting
using 2.5 X 08mm Cypher stent of the proximal D1 with lesion
reduction
from 90% to 0%.
5. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 15mm sprinter balloon,
stenting
using 2.5 X 28mm Cypher stent and post dilation using 3.0 X 20mm
Maverick balloon with lesion reuduction from 99% to 0%.
>>> The final angiogram showd TIMI III flow in the left coronary
system
with no dissection or embolisation. (see PTCA comments)

.
STUDY: AP chest performed on [**2139-1-4**].
FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is
unremarkable. There is
some mild prominence of interstitial markings without evidence
for focal
infiltrates, pleural effusions, or pulmonary edema. Bony
structures are
intact.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
Echo [**2139-1-6**]:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed, EF 40%.
Distal anterior, distal septal, and apical hypokinesis to
akinesis is present.
2. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Right groin u/s:([**2139-1-7**])
In the right groin, there are findings consistent with a
partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm measuring approximately 22 x
21 x 24 mm in maximum diameters originated from the common
femoral artery, the width of the neck is 3 mm. The adjacent
superficial femoral artery, superficial femoral vein and deep
femoral vein are unremarkable.
Multiple benign-appearing lymph nodes measure less than 17 mm
are seen in the right groin.
IMPRESSION: Partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm as described
originated from the common femoral artery.

Right groin U/S: [**2139-1-8**]
A pseudoaneurysm is present in the right inguinal region related
to the common femoral artery which is mostly thrombosed. The
overall size of the pseudoaneurysm is 2.8 x 0.8 cm with the size
of the patent portion of the pseudoaneurysm measuring 0.9 x 0.4
cm. The neck of the pseudoaneurysm is patent currently. The
common femoral artery appears patent on these limited images. On
comparison with the prior study, the area of flow within the
right inguinal pseudoaneurysm appears to have decreased in the
interval.
Given the above findings, it is likely that this pseudoaneurysm
will thrombose spontaneously and we consider that it does not
require intervention (such as thrombin injection) at this time.
A followup ultrasound in [**4-8**] days' time is recommended to
confirm continued resolution of this pseudoaneurysm.
