hypoxia

none

History of Present Illness:
58 M recently discharged [**2118-3-17**] from [**Hospital1 18**]. During that
admission he was diagnosed with a right thalamic hemorrhagic
CVA. He has sever COPD and had a tracheostomy placed [**3-9**] for
difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Pulmonary saw patient
and had bronchoscopy with BAL growing aspergillus fumigatus.
This was discussed with ID and pulmonary and given chronicity
and lack of hemoptysis treatment with anti-fungal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was
deferred to his outpatient pulmonologist.

At rehab had episodes of desaturation at the rehab facility and
was sent to the ER for further evaluation.

In the ER received vancomycin, cefepime, solumedrol, ativan and
a CTA chest showing a right middle lobe pulmonary artery embolus
although this was done through a hand injection and is a limited
study.

CT chest [**3-22**]
MPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, similar to prior study,
likely
reflecting multifocal infection.
3. Left lower lobe consolidation largely resolved, with residual
atelectasis
of the left lower lobe.
4. Small left pleural effusion, decreased in size.
5. Stable hilar adenopathy, likely reactive.
.
CT head [**3-22**]
1. Hypodensity in the right thalamus reflects expected evolution
of prior
thalamic hematoma. Minimal residual hyperdense blood is seen
layering in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles
bilaterally, as well as in the subarachnoid space for the
bilateral parietal and occipital convexities.
2. Stable size of the ventricles without evidence for interval
development of hydrocephalus.
3. Hyperdense 8 mm rounded lesion in the region of the anterior
communicating artery, likely corresponds to known ACOM aneurysm.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 M with hep C, COPD, bronchiectasis s/p recent CVA admitted
from rehab with respiratory distress [**1-18**] aspiration event being
treated for Stenotrophomonas

1. Probable mucous plugging
Patient sent from his LTAC for hypoxia, respiratory distress.
Initial CT chest with question of PE, but this was NOT
demonstrated on a better quality repeat study. No new
significant focal infiltrate here. We felt that this acute
decompensation at his LTAC most likely reflected an episode of
mucous plugging. ID was curbsided as they had been involved with
the patient during his last hospital stay. They did not feel
that he needed to be continued on any of his prior antibiotics
but he was started on course of bactrim (10 day course,
day#1=[**3-22**]) for the Stenotrophomonas.

2. Bronchiectasis with possible healthcare associated pneumonia
Review of his prior micro data did show that he grew
Stenotrophomonas from his [**3-16**] sputum culture. Unclear whether
this was a colonizer given his bronchiectasis and COPD, but we
elected to treat given purulent secretions from trach here. He
was started on TMPSMX on [**3-22**] and should complete a 15day course
to finish on [**6-5**].
Furthermore, chest imaging demonstrated RUL cavitary lesion with
probable aspergilloma. BAL from [**3-11**] had grown Aspergillus
fumigatus, which at that time was felt to be subacute/chronic
issue by pulmonary and ID services - further discussion of
voriconazole was deferred to outpatient pulmonologist.
Suggest repeating CT chest in 6 weeks to evaluate for
progression of cavity and close outpt pulmonary followup. If
imaging significantly changed at that time and/or fungal markers
(glucan/galactomannan) sent during this admit trending up
significantly would favor initiating voriconazaole.

3. Recent CVA
CT head without worsening hemorrhage. He was felt to be
clinically stable by neurology consult service. He should
continue with outpatient PT/OT. Patient's BP 130/70s at
discharge. Patient was restarted on his prior dose of metoprolol
25mg [**Hospital1 **] at discharge.

4. History of tracheostomy
Patient was reevaluated by the speech and swallow service and
their recommendations were as follows:
1. Suggest pt remain NPO with continued alternate means of
nutrition, hydration and medication as you are doing.
2. Q4 oral care.
3. Speech therapy services for dysphagia and
cognitive-linguistic
deficits. Pt can take small amounts of pureed solids and tsps of
nectar thick liquids in therapy based on this evaluation.

5. Hepatitis C
No acute issues in hospital, will require Gi/liver followup. [**Month (only) 116**]
resume spironolactone and lasix if BP stable after discharge.

6. COPD
Continued on atrovent in hospital

7. History of IVDA
Continued on methadone in hospital at 20mg, dose he was on last
admit here
