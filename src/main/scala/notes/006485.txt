History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 112205**] is an 81 year old man with a PMH s/f ESRD with
dialysis, HLD, COPD, Afib, Hypothyroidism, CAD s/p MI, and
gastric ulcer who presents to [**Hospital3 **] with a history of
unsteady gait. Per OSH ED reprot, patient called for assitance
getting off the floor, because his elederly wife was not able to
help him get up. He was not sure why fell, and could not recall
if he hit his head. On CT here, was found to have a subdural
hemtaoma 1.1 cm with 2 mm midline shift. At the time, neurolgoic
exam was normal, save for opacitfication in the L cornea, and R
pupil 2 mm. There is no HCP. During work up there had a
tonic-clonic seizure with eyeward gaze upwards including all 4
extremities, followed by resolutin of seizure activity after 1
mg of ativan, but remained post-ictal for more than 8 minute,
intubated using lidocine, fentyl, etomodate, and succ. sz,
intubated for airway protection [**1-14**] loss of reflexes, CVL at
OSH, phentoin load with 400 mg IV. After the phenytoin load and
persistently there after the pt became hypotensive to 67
systolics. He then received 2L IVF, then started on dopamine. Of
note, troponin I at OSH was 1.08, with a CK-BM 0.5

Patient has history of end-stage renal disease and is maintained
on dialysis. According to outside records, the patient had had
several falls over the past few days, finally prompted him to
present to the [**Hospital **] Hospital. During evaluation at that time,
he was found to have a 1.1 cm subdural hematoma, with 2 mm of
midline shift. The patient and the family did not want transfer
to a tertiary Medical Center at that time, there for psychiatry
was consulted to assess the patient's competance. During this
consultation, the patient sustained a generalized seizure.
Seizure duration was 4 minutes, and stopped after 1 mg of
Ativan. The patient was intubated after the seizure as he did
not appropriately awake for airway protection. After intubation,
the patient had episodes of hypotension, a left IJ was placed,
and the patient was started on dopamine. Upon ED presentation at
our institution, the patient was on 15 of dopamine with a heart
rate in the 130s, blood pressure of 100/50. Patient was
oxygenating well. He received 1 g of IV Dilantin load at the
outside hospital.

In the ED, initial VS were 126 107/44 20 100%. On transfer,
102.3 110 105/50 12 100%. In our ED, he was started on
fent/versed, and neurosurgery evaluated, who indicated that
there was nothing to do surgically; they recommended a repeat
head CT and phenytoin level in the AM. He was started on
Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for a possible shock state, in
addition to phenylephrine. He also had a temperature in the ED
to 102.5, and was given 650 mg PR Tylenol.

An ABG in the ED showed 7.35/41/277. U/A showed trace leuks,
small blood, 6 RBCs, 5 WBCs, few bacteria, and 100 protein.
Lactate was 1.3. Trop on arrival was 0.31. Lytes were notable
for a potassium K 5.4, and a Creatitine of 5.2, with a non-anion
gap metabolic acidosis. WBC was 11.4, HCT 28.5, plt 222 with an
elevated MCV. INR was elevated to 1.3. A bedside U/S in the ED
showed a plump IVC, no pericardial/pleural/peritoneal fluid, and
a very large liver. A CXR was read as having mild pulmonary
edema, with moderate cardiomegaly, with a LIJ central venous
line which ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.
Blood and urine cultures were pending.

Of note, he was admitted from [**Date range (1) 73945**] to [**Hospital3 2568**] for
tachycardia and difficulty breathing in rapid Afib. He was
ultimately adjusted to increased his dose of metoplol to [**Hospital1 **] for
better HR and BP control. Additionally, a discussion was had
with the patient regarding his reluctance to take coumadin given
his low HCT and poor compliance with INR checks. They were also
held in the setting of history of GI [**Last Name (un) **] dand reocccurant
falls.

On arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and sedated
