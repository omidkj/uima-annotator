Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 yo female with h/o CAD s/p CABG '[**38**], recent
hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 22383**] for UTI and CHF exacerbation, who
presents again with shortness of breath similar to previous
presention. Pt was discharged on Lasix and followed up with her
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] noted that the patient had lost 8 pounds and Cr had
bumped from 2.0 -> 2.6. Her lasix was held and pt now presents
again with progressive shortness of breath. It got very bad this
AM with associated substernal chest discomfort that felt like a
pressure, and she was brought into the ED.
.
In the ED, a CXR was taken which shows pulmonary edema, but
could not exclude underlying pneumonia. EKG at the time showed
TWIs in I/aVL and ST depressions in V5-V6, only the TWI in I
being new. Initial enzymes negative x1. She was given 100 mg IV
Lasix, put out 1L, felt much better and transferred to the
floor.
.
On the floor, she notes that she has had a dry cough, feels like
there's something to bring up but cannot. No fever/chills/NS. No
chest pain currently, only mildly short of breath. She has 2
pillow orthopnea at baseline, no PND.
.
Pt also notes chronic left anterior thigh pain, for which she
has had some relief with gabapentin. Opiates were initially
tried, but she developed severe nausea/vomiting and
constipation.
.
ROS:
(+) Rhinorhea on and off for 1 year.
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, or congestion. Denied
palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
.

[**2-26**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2143-2-4**]:
Moderately severe pulmonary edema is probably responsible for
the increasing opacification in both lower lungs since [**2-4**], taken in the setting of chronic pulmonary [**Month (only) 1106**] congestion
and baseline interstitial edema. Nevertheless the relatively
focal opacification in the right mid and both lower lung zones
could represent coexistent pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural
effusions are probably present. Heart size top normal,
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo female with h/o CAD s/p CABG '[**38**], recent hospitalization
from [**Date range (1) 22383**] for UTI and CHF exacerbation, who presents again
with CHF exacerbation due to recent decrease in diuresis. Brief
hospital course by problem below:
.
#) Dyspnea: likely [**2-28**] failure given recent d/c of lasix. In
difficult position [**2-28**] intravascular volume depletion with Cr
remaining elevated to 2.6. Also ? of PNA given CXR findings.
Initially given Lasix 100mg IV in ED with good response,
continued to diurese as needed to keep O2 sats up and decrease
work of breathing.   Ruled out MI with CEx3, and was not a
candidate for intervention anyway given HIT+ and multiple
comorbities. Unlikely component of pneumonia given unproductive
cough, absence of fever and no bump in WBC; however, given
ambiguous CXR possibly having underlying pneumonia, giving
levfloxacin 250 daily starting [**2-28**]. Gave Nitro paste prn for
chest discomfort. Consulted cards: recent echo from [**2144-2-3**] with
normal EF, mild MR. Unlikely to have changed in interim.
[**Hospital 22384**] medical management by d/c'ing nadolol, started Coreg
12.5 [**Hospital1 **], Imdur changed to 180 daily and titrated up to 240,
Hydral changed to 50mg tid and then increased to 75mg tid as
pressure tolerated.  For diuresis, pt needed increasing doses to
keep her O2 level>92%, eventually up to 340mg IV lasix in one
day (120 AM, 100 afternoon, 120 PM) and still requiring 15L NRB,
so pt sent to CCU for lasix drip and closer monitoring. In the
CCU she was stabilized with a Lasix drip and then called out to
the floor with the impression that her dyspnea was
multi-factorial, including will pneumonia (levofloxacin d/c'ed
s/p 10 day course) and anemia
