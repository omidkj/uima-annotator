History of Present Illness:
79M w/ hx of critical AS (valve area 0.5cm2), sCHF, alcoholic
cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and
worsening of AS, who no p/w persistent severe DOE. (Please see
prior discharge summary for full details). During his last
admission he received a thoracentesis. Upon discharge plan was
for cardiac catheterization and evaluation for aortic valve
replacement if his symptoms did not improve. At discharge he did
feel significantly better from when he came in, especially from
the thoracentesis. That evening, he had significant difficulty
even going up a couple steps. The next day he got up but went
straight back to bed, because of severe fatigue. He was bedbound
all of Sat and Sunday, and Sun night had some chest tightness
too while in bed. This morning he called his PCP saying [**Name Initial (PRE) **] think
I should have gone to rehab, and his doctor told him to come in.
He was admitted for evaluation of aortic valve replacement.
Currently he denies any SOB, dyspnea, or CP.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.1, 106/57, 83, 18, 99%RA
.
ROS:
denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2168-5-25**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.5cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**6-7**]/ECHO:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed with anterior and anteroseptal akinesis with
hypokinesis elsewhere. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-5-25**],
left and right ventricular function have now significantly
deteriorated.
