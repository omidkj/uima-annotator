Studies CXR [**4-30**]:
FINDINGS: Previously, the bilateral perihilar opacities have
been decreasing, there is worsening opacity predominantly in
bilateral hila on the current study. There are profoundly low
lung volumes. The distribution favors superimposed acute
pulmonary edema. There may be residual opacity from underlying
infection. There are likely small bilateral pleural effusions
and significant left lower lobe atelectasis. Consistent with the
given history, an endotracheal tube is present. The distal tip
is on the order of 2 cm from the carina which is satisfactory in
placement. The nasogastric tube is in place with the side hole
in the region of the gastroesophageal junction. No pneumothorax
is noted. There is atheromatous disease of the aorta. The
cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess but is likely
stable. There is a rounded density projecting over the left
medial hemithorax, presumably extrinsic to the patient.
.
IMPRESSION: Overall, there is likely superimposed acute
pulmonary edema,
moderate-to-severe in nature, both interstitial and alveolar
which represents a worsening since the prior study. More
confluent opacities noted in the background may be the residual
of prior infection or recurrent aspiration or pneumonia. Repeat
radiography following appropriate diuresis recommended to assess
for underlying infection. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
also evident. Please advance nasogastric tube 5-10 cm.
.
TTE [**5-1**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and
hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior wall and apex
(mid-LAD distribution). The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-4-11**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced and the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher. Minimal
aortic stenosis is now suggested. Left ventricular systolic
function is similar.

RLE US [**5-1**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo F with h/o Diabetes, cardiac disease, presents with acute
shortness of breath to OSH, requiring intubation for respiratory
distress.
.
#. Respiratory distress: Differential included CHF, infection,
PE.  Primary etiology was felt to be most likely CHF rather than
infection given significantly elevated BNP >23,000 and fluid
overload on CXR. Asymmetry had been present on prior recent CXR,
and diffuse congestion is noteably new. Based on recent
discharge summary and follow up cardiology appointments, it
appeared that the patient was no longer taking her lasix at
home.  She received 60mg IV lasix at [**Hospital3 **]. She was
placed on lasix gtt and diuresed well overnight >2,5L.  She was
quickly weaned off the vent and extubated without complication
on [**5-1**].  There was initial concern for concurrent PNA (had
received course of azithro on recent hospitalization for ?
atypical PNA).  She was noted to have a rising WBC count as well
as hypothermia which was concerning for possible early sepsis
and she was started on vanc/cefipime for possible HAP.  She had
received vanc/zosyn and the OSH.  After extubation the patient's
CXR was significantly improved and she did not have significant
cough, sputum or SOB and there was low suspicion for a pulmonary
infection and therefore vanc/cefepime was stopped. The lasix gtt
was discontinued after extubation and she was restarted on PO
lasix of 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] once on the medical [**Hospital1 **]. She had repeat TTE
performed which showed stable EF of 40%.
.
# Leukocytosis: Patient's WBC was normal on admission, however
rose to 8.7 the day after.  She was also hypothermic and
therefore there was concern for an infectious process.  There
was some concern for HAP as above and therefore vanc/cefipime
was started.  She then had low grade temp of 100.  UA was
negative here, however reports from OSH showed dirty UA.
Culture at OSH grew >100,000 cfu of lactose-fermenter.  Per OMR
she has a h/o pan-sensitive Klebsiella UTI.  Given preliminary
