History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with history of coronary artery disease,
ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), obstructive sleep apnea,
originally admitted to [**Hospital6 3105**] with what was
thought to be recurrent congestive heart failure symptoms, s/p
catheterization which showed no active [**Hospital 35745**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for evaluation for ICD vs. CRT.  The patient was recently
hospitalized starting 1.5 weeks ago with worsening CHF and
elevated troponins thought to be due to demand ischemia, as well
as urinary tract infection, was discharged.  He returned two
days after discharge to [**Hospital6 3105**] with increased
abdominal girth according to his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] also found it hard to
stay standing on his feet.  There was also reported 'shallow
breathing.'  He reported taking his medications as prescribed
after discharge, and limiting his salt and fluid intake.  He did
have a slight increase in physical activity upon returning
home,which was thought by the family to be exacerbating his
condition.  Upon being readmitted to LGH, it was noted that he
had a creatinine of 2.1, increased from 1.7 upon his discharge a
few days prior.  He was also being treated with levofloxacin for
a urinary tract infection prior to his discharge.  It was
decided to transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] to be evaluated for CRT.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was noted to be intermittently
apneic, with episodes of gross twitching of his upper
extremities.  Patient was given CPAP treatment with minimal
improvement.  VBG was obtained and showed pH 7.41 pCO2 47.  CXR
showed bilateral opacities at the bases.  Of note, patient had
recently been on gabapentin for neuropathy, which was started
one week ago, and had been initiated on nortryptiline.  Wife
thought that he seemed much more confused than previously at
LGH.  Bladder scan was performed and showed >600 cc urine in
bladder.
.
On review of systems, wife denied any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. Wife denied recent dysuria, fevers, chills or rigors.
Wife denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
