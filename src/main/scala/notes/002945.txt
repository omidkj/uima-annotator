Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 year old female with chronic afib, HTN, HLD, CAD, stage IV
CKD (HD MWF), COPD, dCHF (EF >55%) with multiple admissions for
CHF exacerbations, and with recent thrombosis of her left upper
extremity AV [**First Name3 (LF) **] treated with thrombectomy on [**2187-12-21**], who c/o
dyspnea and was noted to be in RAPID AFIB at HD.
.
Today, 1.5 hrs into HD, the pt became tachycardic w/ HRs in the
170s, so HD was stopped with 15 min left, after having gotten 2L
IVF off. She was mentating okay per EMS and had no sx. EMS gave
2.5 mg cardizem. Pt has been noted to be fluid responsive on
previous admissions.
.
In the ED, she was given 500 cc and another 500 cc, w/ hr going
down to 130, and bp in the 100s. She got 10+5mg of dilt IV w/
pressures dropping to the 70s, with some change in mentation, so
dilt was held. 2nd bolus of 500cc + 500cc was given and since
she had labile bp, it was decided to trasnfer her to CCU.  She
got 25 mg po metoprolol and 5 mg metoprolol IV.
.
Vitals on transfer were hr 86, bp 85/45, rr 20, 100% RA. Rhythm
was reported to be still in afib.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

FINDINGS: Single supine AP portable view of the chest was
obtained. Again
seen, there are increased diffuse interstitial opacities
bilaterally, may be due to pulmonary edema, although appears
less severe than on the prior study. Slight blunting of the
bilateral costophrenic angles may be due to small bilateral
pleural effusions. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
stable. Left subclavian stent is again seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old female with chronic afib, HTN, HLD, CAD, stage IV
CKD (HD MWF), COPD, dCHF (EF >55%) who presented w/ AFIB w/ RVR
and labile BPs after undergoing HD.
.
# AFIB w/ RVR: Pt has a hx of chronic AFIB and presented today
with RVR, likely in the setting of being over diuresed. Per
prior cardiology consult note, "It is most likely that the
patient has baseline low blood pressures from poor autonomic
tone and other factors, and her blood pressures are further
reduced during tachycardic
episodes in the setting of her diastolic dysfunction and left
ventricular hypertrophy. Midrodrine should help the poor
autonomic tone. She cannot augment her cardiac output enough
when she is hemodynamically challenged (such as during fluid
removal). It is also possible that because of her hyperdynamic
LV function and LVOT gradient, she develops severe LVOT
obstruction when her stroke volume is reduced and when she is
tachycardic - similar to a patient with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. We would also recommend reducing the rate of
fluid removal during HD." Pt was placed on amiodarone and
metoprolol, and converted to sinus rhythm. Of note, she did not
have, but needs to be, continued on the above nodal blocking
agents on discharge. She was continued
