HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:   The patient was admitted to the medical
intensive care unit for evaluation and management of bright
red blood per rectum.  Throughout his stay in the Intensive
Care Unit remained hemodynamically stable without chest pain
or shortness of breath.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  On the day following admission, the
patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedure for
further evaluation of his bright red blood per rectum.  On
esophagogastroduodenoscopy a single nonbleeding 3-mm ulcer
was found in the gastroesophageal junction.  This was felt to
be likely from a prior banding site.  Portal hypertensive
gastropathy was also noted.  No esophageal varices were
noted.  The patient's bright red blood per rectum was
considered by the Medical Intensive Care Unit and
Gastrointestinal services to be secondary to his internal
hemorrhoids.  The patient was restarted on his outpatient
dosages of diuretic medications.
