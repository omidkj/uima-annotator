Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2153-7-6**] Aortic valve replacement with a size 27-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve. Tricuspid valve repair with a size 34 [**Doctor Last Name **]
MC3 ring.


History of Present Illness:
42 year old female who is originally from [**Country 4194**], has a history
of a bicuspid aortic valve with aortic stenosis. She had a prior
catheterization in [**2149**] which revealed normal coronary arteries
with a calculated aortic valve area of
0.9cm2 and a peak to peak gradient of 41mmHg across the aortic
valve. Also in [**2149**] she was evaluated by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
repeated syncopal episodes and it was felt that her syncope was
vasovagal in nature. She has had mild dyspnea on exertion over
the last 2.5 years that became significantly worse about a month
ago. She was previously able to climb two flights of stairs
before stopping and now she has to stop after half a flight due
to shortness of breath. She is also experiencing new onset
central mid chest pressure with exertion which radiates to her
neck. This occurs associated with dyspnea, lightheadedness and
diaphoresis. She also reports feeling easily fatigued over the
last few weeks and has had several episodes of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea. She has continued to have syncopal and
presyncopal episodes occurring sporadically. She is unable to
say how often. She was referred for cardiac catheterization
followed by surgical evaluation for an aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinetic
inferior wall and dyskinetic inferior septum. The remaining left
ventricular segments are also modelrately hypokinetic. The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
function. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque
to XX cm from the incisors. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid
valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:

1. Marginally improved global and focal LV systolci function ith
background inotropic support

2. Thereis a mechanical [**Hospital1 **]-leaflet valve in aortic positon, Well
seated and stable, with good leaflet excursion/ Trace to mild
valvular AI jets which are consistent with signature
regurgitation jets of these valves. No apprecaible transaortic
gradient

3. An aanuloplasty ring is identified in the tricuspid position.
Well seated and stable with good leaflet excursion. Trace
tricuspid regurgitation and no evidence of trisuspid stenosis.

4. MR is now mild.

5. Unchanged right ventricular systolic function.

6. Intact aorta

Final Report
INDICATION: Patient with atrial valve replacement and tricuspid
valve ring.
Evaluate for progression of pneumothorax and pleural effusions.

COMPARISON: Pre-op radiograph from [**2153-6-28**] and portable
radiographs
from [**2153-7-8**].

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral chest x-ray.

FINDINGS: Poor lung expansion with interval improvement of
pulmonary edema
and pulmonary vascular congestion. The widened vascular pedicle
of the
mediastinum has improved considerably as well. There is
persistent
right-sided pleural effusion with concurrent atelectasis.
Pneumonia cannot be
excluded and should be considered in the right clinical setting.
A small
right apical pneumothorax is present. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax are
observed in the left lung field. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
Sternotomy
wires are intact and aortic and tricuspid valve rings are
present.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of pulmonary vascular
congestion and
pulmonary edema. Decreased mediastinal widening. Persistent
right-sided
pleural effusion with attendant atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.





Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**7-6**] and underwent surgery with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Transferred
to the CVICU in stable condition on titrated epinephrine,
phenylephrine and propofol drips. Extubated later that day and
transferred to the floor on POD #1 to begin increasing her
activity level. Gently diuresed toward her preop weight.
Coumadin started for mechanical AVR and bridged with IV heparin
until therapeutic. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per
protocol. She was anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin and
was discharged with an INR of 2.4 on 3 mgs of coumadin.
Continued to make good progress and cleared for discharge to
home with VNA on POD #6. First INR check will be [**2153-7-13**] with
results faxed to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2808**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 18266**]. All f/u
appts were advised.
