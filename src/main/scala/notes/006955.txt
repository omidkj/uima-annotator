ECHO [**2191-6-21**]: EF 25%. E/A Ratio: 0.86. left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis
and distal LV/apical akinesis to dyskinesis. left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo M with HTN, hyperlipidemia, no known CAD p/w acute
anterior wall MI s/p V-fib arrest s/p defibrillation at [**Hospital 5367**]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath s/p stent to LAD, currently
stable.

# Cardiac
1. Ischemia. Multiple risk factors for CAD including HTN,
hyperlipidemia, obesity. Patient having crescendo angina, no
other episodes of CP per patient prior to this episode, likely
acute vulnerable plaque occlusion to mid LAD c/w EKG showing ST
elevations in aterolateral leads. went for cath. Had LAD
stented. continued with aspirin,plavix, lisinopril, toprol. may
need ETT in future to eval other lesions seen on cath

2. Pump. EF 25%. reports intermittent pedal edema, sleeps with
several pillows at home. On lasix at home. chest clear. JVD
mildly elevated. started on lisinopril, toprol. ECHO showed
apical akinesis. hence started on heparin and coumadin to
prevent thrombus formation. sent home on lovenox and coumadin.

3. Rhythm. s/p V.fib arrest, was in SR with PVCs,NSVTs ([**12-31**]
beats) AIVR s/p cath.
was started on toprol

# HTN. continued on BB, ACE-I

# Hyperlipidemia. continued on Atorvostatin 80 for now due to
ACS
