Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided arm pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension,
diabetes and COPD who had dull left arm pain for two to three
minutes early in the morning on [**2187-11-9**]. He denied any
associated chest pain, jaw pain, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting, or diaphoresis. The patient stated that the arm pain
abated on its own. During this episode of transient arm pain the
patient reported that his blood pressure was lower than usual at
100/40. He went to seek medical advice in the emergency room at
an outside hospital where he was found to have ST elevations in
the II, III, and aVF. He was given ASA, Plavix and started on
Heparin drip. No beta blocker or nitroglycerin was given
secondary to HR in 40s and a low blood pressure with 100-110
systolic BP.

Mr. [**Known lastname 96908**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible cardiac
catheterization.
Interventional cardiology team evaluated the patient and felt
that there was no urgency or immediate indication for cardiac
catheterization. This decision was made given that repeat EKG
had no changes significant for STEMI. Mr. [**Known lastname 96908**] had three
negative sets of cardiac enzymes as well which further
corroborated the decision to defer any invasive procedures.  At
the time of CCU transfer the patient was asymptomatic and his
Heparin drip had been discontinued. Of note, the patient does
have a TIMI risk score is [**3-11**], placing him at intermediate risk
for cardiac event. At baseline, the patient has very limited
functional status as well and has significant co-morbidities,
including COPD, Diabetes/II, and hypothyroidism. Otherwise, from
a cardiac standpoint the patient denied any prior invasive
cardiac interventions, MI history or stroke history.


Past Medical History:
CARDIAC HISTORY : Cardiac risk factors are positive for
Diabetes, HTN, Obesity, but negative for hyperlipidemia. The
patient has no significant past CAD morbidity per records,  no

placed.

OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension
Hypothyroidism
COPD-on home O2 (usually 2L via NC, not continuous but PRN and

in [**Location (un) 620**] called [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 363**]. The patient's tobacco history
includes 120 pack year history. The patient quit smoking 30

Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC ECHO [**2187-11-10**]:
Suboptimal study with limited echo window. The left ventricle is
not well seen. Left ventricular function cannot be reliably
assessed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

EKG [**2187-11-9**]:
Sinus bradycardia, mild Right axis deviation. Rate 48. No acute
ST changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
In Summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 96908**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male who presented to
CCU after [**Hospital **] transfer from outside hospital for emergent
evaluation for what was thought to be an inferior STEMI after
initial EKG at OSH showed minimal .5mm-1mm elevations in leads
II, III, and aVF. He was given ASA, Plavix and started on
Heparin drip. No beta blocker or nitroglycerin was given because
of the patient's low heart rate in the high 40s -50s range in
conjunction with his ongoing low blood pressures in the 100-110
systolic range.

As aforementioned, the patient was evaluated by [**Hospital1 1388**]
interventional cardiology team and it was felt that there was no
urgency or immediate indication for cardiac catheterization
given that the review of a repeat EKG had no changes significant
for STEMI. Moreover, Mr. [**Known lastname 96908**] also had three negative sets of
cardiac enzymes. The patient's dull, left-sided arm pain was
attributed to fleeting ischemia and likely some atypical chest
pain but no true cardiac infarcts. The patient's presentation
and workup did not warrant any invasive procedures at this time.
A lipid profile was explored and showed reasonable values with
no overt hyperlipidemia as his total cholesterol was 160, HDL
41, LDL 95 and Triglycerides 121.

Of note, the patient does have multiple cardiac risk factors,
including age, male gender, HTN, diabetes and smoking history.
TIMI risk score is [**3-11**], placing him at intermediate risk. For
his entire hospital stay Mr. [**Known lastname 96908**] remained asymptomatic and
denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or
palpitations.The patient had no additional episodes of left arm
pain. The patient was continued on his daily Aspirin and his
Metoprolol was initially held given his mild bradycardia but
continued once his rate improved. He also had improvement in his
low blood pressures throughout his hospital stay but it was felt
that he should discontinue his HCTZ at time of discharge in
order to avoid any additional BP drops and he was also advised
to defer his Metoprolol dose if his heart rate dropped below 50
or his home systolic blood pressure dropped below 100. The
patient was asked to discontinue his HCTZ and to start taking
Lisinopril 2.5mg daily with Metoprolol 12.5mg twice daily for
appropriate control of his blood pressure. He was also advised
to follow-up within 1 week with his primary care physician for
ongoing management of his hypertension and additional
co-morbidities as outlined above.

In terms of the patient's pump function, he arrived to the CCU
in a euvolumic state based on lab data and clinical exam. He
exhibited no signs or symptoms of CHF.
The patient's heart rhythm was monitored
