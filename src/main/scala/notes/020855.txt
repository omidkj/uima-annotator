Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2138-6-24**] Cardiac Catheterization
[**2138-6-27**] Four Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
artery, with saphenous vein grafts to first and second obtuse
marginal, and posterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17492**] is a 67-year-old male patient with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and CAD, s/p MI and
multiple PCIs. His most recent cardiac catheterization was on
[**2138-3-3**] where he was found to have a 40% lesion in his LMCA, a
50% stenosis in the proximal LAD, and a 100% stenosis in the
OM2. The RCA was known to be occluded and not engaged. His
stents were patent.
.
Of note, he began using nitroglycerin tablets about a month ago.
This helped his chest pain which usually last about 10mins. The
CP usually occurs one hour after he eats. He reports that the
nitroglycerin used to work within 5 secs and now after a month
of use, the NG start to work after a minute. The CP also
increased in intensity from previously [**2-4**] to about [**7-7**]. Chest
Pain is substernal without any radiation. Prior to the month, he
did not use NG and suffered through the CP - usually waiting for
it to pass by resting. He used to be able to finish a golf game
by taking frequent rest on the golf cart. During his previous
admission earlier this year, he deferred CABG due to the fact
that it did not fit with his schedule.
.
He presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED with complaints of chest discomfort
on and off all night. Apparently he would take a nitroglycerin
and the pain would resolve for approximately 30 minutes then
return. He did not tell his wife who is a RN at [**Name (NI) **] because
he didn't want her to call EMS. On the morning of admission, he
was diaphoretic and she asked what was the matter. He told her
he had been having chest discomfort all night and taken a total
of 8 nitroglycerin. He presented to the ED at 9:30 am this
morning pain free with a blood pressure of 181/105 (question
nitroglycerin outdated). He was given an inch of nitropaste and
his b/p is now 132/75, HR 69. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] has requested patient
be transferred for cardiac catheterization. His first troponin
is 0.18, his finger stick was 279 but he was not given any
coverage because he took his am hypoglycemics.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and dyspnea
on exertion. Negative for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC CATH [**2138-6-24**]:  Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA had
a distal 20% stenosis. The LAD had a proximal 70% stenosis that
extended from the LMCA to the proximal edge of the Cypher stent
placed in [**10-5**]. The LCx had mild diffuse plaquing associated
with a 30% stenosis proximal to the mid-LCx stents after OM2.
The OM1 had a 20% stenosis at its origin. The LCx provided
collaterals to a long right posterolateral branch. The RCA was
moderately calcified and had a 70% proximal-mid stenosis, a 90%
mid stenosis, and a distal occlusions with right-right
collaterals filling a small PDA and posterolateral branches.

ECHO [**2138-6-25**] : The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal inferior and
infero-lateral segments. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.

CAROTID ULTRASOUND [**2138-6-25**]:
1. 70-79% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. 80-89% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.

HEAD/CHEST/NECK CTA [**2138-6-25**]: 1. Two tiny pulmonary nodules in
the right middle lobe and one in the right upper lobe. Further
followup is recommended. 2. Moderate right internal carotid and
mild right external carotid artery narrowing caused by mixed
calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque. 3. Very
severe left internal carotid artery stenosis, caused by
calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque.
4. Findings concerning for periapical abscess formation in the
right anterior maxillary teeth. 5. There is no intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or
edema. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is normally preserved.
The ventricles, basal cisterns and sulci are normal in size and
configuration.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 17492**] was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization. In
catheterization, he was found to have an LAD lesion proximal to
his previous stent that was unamenable to another stent
intervention - see result section for further details. Cardiac
surgery was therefore consulted and further preoperative
evaluation was performed. Carotid ultrasound revealed
moderate-to-s
