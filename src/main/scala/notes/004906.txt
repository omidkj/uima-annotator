OSH Imaging:
Duplex US: right LE DVT from the common femoral vein to the
popliteal vein.
.
CT Head: no ICH or mass effect, perventricular small vessel
ischemia 9left parietal lobe)
.
CTA Chest:
1. extensive mural thrombus through the thoracic aorta involving
the arch and descending aorta as well as abdominal aorta.
2. pulmonary emboli at the junction of the R upper and middle
lobe arteries. Other emboli in RML, RLL, and LLL arteries.
3. 2x1 cm left adrenal mass


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo man remote hx prostate cancer, presenting to OSH with RLE
swelling and found to have multiple regions of thromboses
including DVT, PE, aortic mural thrombosis

1) Multiple thromboses, both arterial and venous:
a) RLE DVT
b) Extensive mural thrombus of aortic arch and descending
abdominal aorta
c) PE: junction right upper and right middle lob artery; also PE
of RML, RLL, LLL distal vessel

Vascular surgery was consulted on arrival to ED and felt pt did
not have clinical need for surgical intervention/thrombectomy at
this time.  He remained hemodynamically stable but was admitted
to ICU for close observation due to his significant clot burden.
 On admission pt was placed on heparin drip and started on
coumadin. Etiology of clots are unknown; denies hx of prior
clots or FH of hypercoagulable state. Patient has a distant
history of prostate cancer (previously seen by a radiation
oncologist) but PSA ([**2181-7-13**]) was found to be 0.1.  Given an
adrenal nodule of undetermined significance on OSH CT, an
adrenal protocol CT scan was done that showed adrenal
hyperplasia but no evidence of malignancy. Retroperitoneal and
periportal lymph nodes were found to be enlarged but not meeting
pathologic criteria. LDH, Cr, CBC, and Ca were normal. He will
need outpt age-appropriate cancer screening as well as f/u in
with hematology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for evaluation of
hypercoagulablity. He has also been instructed to initiate care
with a new PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was initiated on coumadin, and will have his
INR followed at rehab. After that he will need to have his INR
monitored by his new PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] perhaps the [**Hospital3 **]
in [**Location (un) 620**].

2) COPD:  Pt was placed on 4L NC on admission, given nebs for
mild sx of dyspnea.  Sx likely related to PE; no evidence of
COPD flare. He also had small bilateral effusions with
associated compressive atelectasis, likely related to his
systolic heart failure. His O2 requirement decreased slightly
with gentle diuresis.

3) Alcohol abuse: Pt has a history of alcohol abuse and seemed
to be confabulating at times.  Pt was started on folate,
thiamine, and electrolytes were monitored.  Due to alcohol use
pt was thought to be at high risk for gastritis and was started
on PPI prophylaxis.  Pt was given valium for withdrawal
prophylaxis in ICU.  After discussion with patient's family, it
was felt that patient was at his baseline mental status.

4) Eosinophilia of unclear significance: developed in-house. As
the absolute eosinophil count was less than 1000 and he had no
signs or symptoms of allergic drug reaction or end-organ damage.
 He will need to have this monitored in the outpatient setting.

5) Systolic heart failure: the patient was found to have an EF
of 35% by TTE. Calls to his current and prior PCP produced no
evidence of having had prior echos. His heart failure is of
unknown chronicity or etiology. He denies a history of CAD,
although he has dyslipidemia. He was started on low-dose beta
blocker and ACEI which he tolerated, and he was diuresed gently
as above. He was made an appointment to follow up with an
outpatient cardiologist.

6) Aortic stenosis: He was found to have moderate to severe
aortic stenosis of TTE. This is of unknown chronicity but the
patient has been asymptomatic with no history of chest pain or
syncope. Lasix was dosed cautiously given this finding, and he
will follow up with an outpatient cardiologist.
