Attending:[**Male First Name (un) 5282**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, hyperkalemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
30 year old man with history of biliary atresia s/p liver
transplant at age 4 who presents from home with nausea and
vomiting for the last several days. He called the transplant
center on the day of admission and they checked outpatient labs
which were remarkable for K of 6.0. He was advised to come to
the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.7, HR 79, BP 119/77, RR 22,
98%RA. K was 6.3. CBC and LFTs were consistent with priors.
Creatinine was 2.8 (c/w recent basline). EKG showed no
hyperkalemic changes. Abdomen was soft and no imaging was felt
to be necessary. Patient got 10U insulin, 1 amp D50, 15g
kayexalate, and repeat K was 4.9. He was admitted for treatment
of nausea, vomiting, and hyperkalemia. Liver fellow was
contact[**Name (NI) **] in [**Name (NI) **] and requested Prograf level be checked 12 hours
post last dose. Liver fellow agreed with admission to liver
service. Vitals at time of transfer were afebrile, HR 86, BP
133/86, RR 18, sat99%RA.
.
Of note, patient was seen in kidney clinic on [**5-31**] (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
for follow-up of postinfectious glomerulonephritis. He had been
hospitalized several days before for symptoms of flank pain in
the setting of recent URI in [**Month (only) **]. Renal biopsy during that
admission was c/w post-infectious GN. He was discharged on
lisinopril 5 qday, Phoslo, sodium bicarb and tacrolimus.
Creatinine since that time has ranged from 2.1-2.9. Per notes
from the office visit, plan was to continue above meds and add
Lasix, uptitrating prn, for anasarca.
.
Currently, patient denies nausea. He says that he has been
having vomiting on and off for the last three days, and he has
been unable to hold any food down. He denies abdominal pain and
there is no history of diarrhea. For his symptoms, he says he
has been taking ibuprofen, 1 pill at a time, but he cannot
specify how frequently. It appears from his allergy list that
this has been a documented allergy for him in the past, and it
is unclear why he continues to take this medicine.

IMAGING:
[**2135-6-11**] CXR FINDINGS: No previous images. Bibasilar
opacifications, more prominent on the left, consistent with
pleural effusions and compensatory basilar atelectasis. The
upper lung zones are clear and there is no evidence of vascular
congestion.

[**2135-6-12**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-11**],
allowing for differences in technique, there is probably little
change in the bilateral pleural effusions, slightly more
prominent on the left. Basilar atelectatic change is also seen
on the left.

[**2135-6-12**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN: No previous images. There is a
relative paucity of bowel gas presenting in a nonspecific
pattern. Although no dilatation of gas-filled loops is seen, the
possibility of a dilated fluid-filled bowel loops can certainly
not be excluded. If there is any serious clinical concern for
obstruction, CT would be necessary.

Findings of avascular necrosis are seen in the right femoral
head.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Small bowel resection: Patient was admitted because of
hyperkalemia. On the night of admission he developed acute
abdomen and underwent emergent laparotomy. A 5cm area of
deserosalized tissues was found and a small bowel resection
performed. The post-op course was complicated by persistent
abdominal pain and intractable nausea and vomiting for ~2 weeks.
This subsequently resolved prior to the patient being transfered
to the hepatology service.

 #SBP: At about 2 weeks post-op the patient developed increased
abdominal pain. A diagnositic paracentesis was done that
revealed a WBC of [**Numeric Identifier 26452**] with 90% neutrophils. He was
subsequently transfered to the hepatology service. He was
started on ceftriaxone and albumin. He continued to have
abdominal pain and a repeat diagnostic paracentesis was done 2
days after initiation of treatment. This revealed a WBC of 5300
with 50% neutrophils indicating persistent infection despite
treatment. On [**7-12**] a diagnostic paracentesis was done that
showed a WBC of 3. Treatment with ceftriaxone was continued for
a total course of 2 weeks and he was then started on
ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.

 # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was persistently
tachypneic to the mid 20s throughout his hospitalization. On the
morning of  [**7-15**] he was found to be tachypneic to 30s, using
accesory muscles and had cough blood tinged sputum.  His
respiratory status improved with diuresis and CXR showed
persistent left pleural effusion that was unchanged. An  ABG was
done once the patient was off O2 and it revealed A-a gradient of
48 (nl 10) which was consistent with significant shunting. That
afternoon the patient again developed respiratory di
