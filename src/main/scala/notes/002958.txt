Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76M oxygen-dependent COPD (on 3 L with baseline pOx 90-92%)
presents with 2 week history of dyspnea on exertion with
associated neck discomfort he describes as "chest heaviness,"
and new productive cough. Current "exacerbation" was similar to
prior exacerbation a couple of years ago; however, his
associated neck discomfort was not present.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his outpatient pulmonologist, placed him on a
prednisone burst and avelox on [**6-13**], for presumed COPD
exacerbation. He completed a 7-day course of Avelox, and then
was renewed for another 7 day course 2 days ago for persistent
symptoms. He was put on 60mg daily of prednisone and two days
ago weaned down to 40mg daily. He continued to have difficulty
with SOB and breathing.

He has had sick contacts including a son with pneumonia
recently. He denies fever, chills, but does endorse mild
productive cough. No smoking or recent healthcare exposures.

He endorses dyspnea when laying flat, but he does not endorse
any weight gain or increased swelling in his lower extremities.
He takes lasix 20mg prn at home and took one tablet 1.5 weeks
ago, but hasn't needed it since. Given his persistent dyspnea
and his chest heaviness, he called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today, who
recommended he presented to ER. He describes the chest heaviness
as located in the top of his chest, at the base of his neck,
that does not radiate and has been fairly constant recently. It
is exacerbated with exertion and improved with rest.

In the ED, initial VS were:  97.6 109 154/73 18 88% 3L Nasal
Cannula. Initially trigerred for respiratory distress given
solumedrol, ipratroprium/albuterol nebs with improved
respiratory status. Labs revealed elevated white count thought
secondary to recent prednisone burst. D-Dimer was negative. ABG
on 3 liters of oxygen 7.4/36/53. BNP/Troponin T were 527 and <
0.01, respectively. CXR was performed without significant change
from prior. EKG with scooped ST segments in the inferior leads.
Given neck pain noted and concern that this could represent a
cardiac equivalent, Aspirin 325mg was given. Vitals on transfer:
BP 125/59, HR 90, RR 18, pOx 89 on RA.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 97.8, 155/61, 97, 25, 90%
3L. Pt resting comfortably in the chair, speaking in full
sentences, in NAD. Currently complaining of the same chest
heaviness he has been having recently, but otherwise feels well
and much better than when he initially presented.

[**2185-6-27**] ECHO:
Poor image quality. The left atrium is elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve is not well seen. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-11-3**],
the degree of pulmonary hypertension detected is now severe.

Imaging:

CXR [**6-26**] - no infiltrates, bibasilar atelectasis.

Chest CT [**6-29**]

IMPRESSION:
1.  Suspected tracheobronchomalacia as described.
2.  Extensive diffuse atherosclerosis.
3.  Evidence of small airway disease.
4.  Several pulmonary nodules as described that should be
reevaluated in [**7-26**] months interval with chest CT.

Lung scan [**6-30**]:
Low probability for PE


Micro

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo M w/ COPD stage II (on 3L O2 at home) p/w dyspnea and neck
discomfort for the past 2 weeks, after failing outpt therapy
with avelox and prednisone, found to have acute respiratory
failure, likely multifactorial, as well as secondary
polycythemia.

ACUTE ISSUES
# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure - Pt p/w 2 week of dyspnea,
failing outpt treatment with Avelox and prednisone for presumed
COPD exacerbation. He was initially admitted to the ICU, and
treated supportively with antibiotics of CTX/azithromycin,
prednisone and nebulizers, briefly and then transferred to the
floor.  He was seen by the pulmonary consult service of Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was continued on prednisone, just
azithromcyin with no evidence of pneumonia on imaging, and
nebulizers.  He was also diuresed given concern that there was a
component of volume overload leading to his worsening hypoxia.
He was ultimately discharged home on a prednisone taper, spiriva
and increased home oxygen.

## Chronic hypoxic respiratory failure, with chronic COPD.  He
was admitted with acute exacerbation of chronic hypoxia.  His
chronic hypoxia was evaluated with chest CT, ECHO, repeat PFTs
and lung scan.  ECHO showed worsening pulmonary artery
hypertension.  Thus lung scan was performed to identify chronic
thromboembolic disease as a cause of PAH, which was negative.
Chest CT showed question of TBM, and bronchiolitis, and lung
nodules, but not significant interestitial disease.  PFTS were
stable.  He was discharged home with O2 at 5L, with plan for
further outpt pulmonary workup.  He was discharged on
advair,,spiriva, alb
