HISTORY: Status post CABG.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-1**], there is little
overall change. Substantial opacification is again seen at the
right base, consistent with persistent pleural effusion and
probable underlying atelectasis.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2101-1-21**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA. The IVC was not visualized.
The RA pressure could not be estimated.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. No LV mass/thrombus.
No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with conduction
abnormality/ventricular pacing. Prominent moderator
band/trabeculations are noted in the RV apex.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal
views. Suboptimal image quality - poor suprasternal views. The
rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation. Left pleural effusion.


Conclusions

The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral akinesis and thinning and anterolateral
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
30-35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet
motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets and supporting structures are
mildly thickened. Mild [1+] mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal functioning bioprosthetic aortic valve.
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with
coronary artery disease. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-1-21**],
the aortic valve has been replaced with a normal functioning
bioprosthetic valve. The regional wall motion abnormalities and
overall left ventricular systolic function appear similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**1-27**] where he underwent an
AVR/CABG. He was transferred to the ICU in critical but stable
condition on epi, neo and propofol. He was extubated later that
same day. His epi and neo were weaned to off over the next
several days. He was transfused. He had atrial fibrillation for
which he was started on amiodarone. No coumadi required. He was
transferred to the floor on POD # 6. All DChest tubes / PW and
foley were removed. There was no sequele noted. PT saw pt,
recommended rehab. Pt stable for rehab.
