Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85yo woman with h/o CAD s/p MI in [**2134**] and HTN who presents
with complaint of chest pain.

The patient reports episodes of substernal chest pain over the
last week. She describes shooting pain that "pulled from side to
side," not associated with exertion. She thought the pain was
indigestion and did not seek care.

The night prior to admission, she was feeling stressed after
seeing her husband at rehab, where he has been staying since an
MI treated at [**Hospital1 18**] in the CCU 02/[**2162**]. She went home and ate a
hot dog with relish, then had a chocolate bar and fried [**Last Name (un) 106277**].
When she went to bed, she started having severe right-sided
chest pain, which she variably describes as being under her
right breast vs just to the right of her sternum. No associated
nausea, dyspnea, or diaphoresis. Not pleuritic. She tried some
tylenol and then smoked a cigarette, but without any relief.
After taking some nasal spray (azelastine), she began feeling
palpitations and shortness of breath. In the morning, she called
her daughter, who brought her to see her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] her PCP's
office at 10:30am, she felt fine; the chest pain and dyspnea had
resolved on their own. Her PCP noted EKG changes and sent her to
the ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.1 67 146/76 19 95% on ??. There
were no acute EKG changes noted, and she was given ASA 324mg, SL
NTG. She was going to be admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for rule out when she
developed acute respiratory distress with SBP up to 170s and
sat's down into the 80s. CXR demonstrated significant pulmonary
edema, and she was given lasix 40mg IV as well as put on a nitro
gtt. She was placed on CPAP at 8 and admitted to the CCU.

Upon arrival to the CCU, she was breathing comfortably on 4L by
nasal cannula and chest pain free. Nitro gtt at 0.78.

The patient reports having poor energy for the last couple of
months. She has also had poor appetite. She has 4 pillow
orthopnea but denies PND. She endorses some minor LE edema x 1
week but no weight gain.

Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI in the [**2134**]; reports she had a second minor MI
shortly after, both medically managed.
HTN
GERD
h/o Choledocholithiasis [**2153**] s/p ERCP and sphincterotomy
h/o Acute cholecystitis [**2156**] s/p cholecystostomy tube, followed
by open CCY c/b wound infection, epigastric hernia
Gout
h/o GI bleed in [**2148**], ?? due to diverticulosis
h/o transfusion reaction
s/p appendectomy
s/p Open reduction and internal fixation of left hip.
s/p C section.

PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) 569**] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 133**]

ALLERGIES: NKDA

Social History:
Social history is significant for the presence of current
tobacco use. She has smoked 1 pack per week x 70 years. She
denies alcohol abuse. She had been living with her husband until
[**Month (only) 956**], when he had his MI. He has been in and out of
hospitals/rehab since then. She has 2 children in [**Location (un) 86**] and in
[**Hospital1 614**]. She walks with a cane since a hip fracture. She does
not have a visiting nurse, but a woman comes to help clean from
time to time.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
VS: T 97.1, BP 143/80, HR 96, RR 26, O2 96% on 4L
Gen: Pleasant elderly woman, mildly tachypneic when talking but
able to complete full sentences; somewhat tearful when talking
about changes in her life. Oriented x3.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 5cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RR, normal S1, S2. +systolic murmur at apex. No S4, no S3.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Faint
crackles at bases b/l, no wheeze or rhonchi.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness. No abdominial
bruits.
Ext: Left > right LE edema. No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Carotids 2+ without bruit; distal pulses dopplerable b/l


Pertinent Results:
EKG on admission demonstrated NSR with normal axis and
incomplete BBB with old inferior Q waves and T wave flattening
in I, aVL, and V5-V6. As compared with prior from [**2161**],
prominent R wave in V2 has disappeared and lateral T wave
flattening is new.

CXR [**2162-7-8**] (dictated): Lateral right hemithorax cut off. No
definite pneumonia. Central hilar prominence suggestive of
congestion. No large pleural effusion on left

[**Month/Day/Year **] [**11/2160**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
inferior and inferolateral akinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened, without prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.

Bedside TTE in CCU [**2162-7-8**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with extensive inferior,
inferolateral and lateral akinesis (LCx distribution). There is
mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 25-30%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.

pMIBI [**2161-5-13**]:
84 yo woman (h/o MI) was referred to evaluate an atypical chest
discomfort and fatigue. Due to a limited ability to exercise
(prior hip fx) and limited hemodynamic response to exercise
without ECG changes or symptoms, a persantine-MIBI was
performed. The patient was administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of
persantine over 4 minutes.
No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported by the
patient
during the procedure. No significant ST segment changes were
noted from baseline. The rhythm was sinus with frequent aea and
infrequent vea. The hemodynamic response to the persantine
infusion was appropriate. Three min post-MIBI, the patient was
administered 125 mg aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: Limited functional exercise tolerance secondary to
orthopedic limitations; persantine MIBI performed. No anginal
symptoms or ECG changes from baseline. Nuclear report sent
separately.
