<BR><H3>PENDING ISSUES/FOLLOWUP:</H3>
<b>1. BLOOD PRESSURE:</B> The patient's systolic blood pressure
ranged 85-115. She was low even on 25 of metoprolol QID (at home
was on Toprol XL 200).  She is being discharged on Toprol XL
100mg daily.

<br><b>2. CHF:</b> Her repiratory status was stable and she had
sats in the high 90s on her home O2 level of 2 lpm via NC. We
gave her fluids only very gently and did not diurese her. She
was fluid positive about 2L over the course of her hopital stay
but after transfer to the floor she had relatively equal Is and
Os with good urine output (around 1L on day prior to discharge).
We discharged her on her home dose of torseminde but held the
metolazone. She will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in clinic on [**2130-10-16**].
<br><b>3. Recurrent pleural effusion:</b>She is at her baseline
respiratory status. She will be seen in the interventional
pulmonology clinic to have a pleurex catheter placed to
facilitate
<br><b>4. Cancer:</b> The cells in the pleural fluid are more
likely breast than uterine. She was followed by her primary
oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She was restarted on Arimidex, an
aromatase inhibitor. She will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2130-10-13**].<br>

CT CHEST/A/P
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate sized left pleural effusion and small right pleural
effusion,
with enhancing pleural margins on the right, which may be
secondary to an
inflammatory or infectious process, though this appears similar
to prior
study.
2. Dilated small bowel loops, with decompressed and tethered
small bowel
loops in the pelvis, concerning for a small-bowel obstruction.
Locules of
extra-luminal air are noted in the mid abdomen.
3. Moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen with new nodular
appearance
of the peritoneum, concerning for peritoneal carcinomatosis.
4. Subacute right inferior pubic ramus fracture, with
insufficiency fractures
of the sacral ala bilaterally.
5. Stable multiple compression deformities of the thoracolumbar
spine, as
detailed.

KUB ([**10-5**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged bowel gas pattern consistent with partial SBO
2. Ascites.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions.

Pleural fluid (collected [**2130-9-22**]):

  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Consistent with adenocarcinoma.
   -Tumor cells are immunoreactive for Keratin AE1/AE3/CAM 5.2,
B72.3 and
    [**Last Name (un) **]-31.
   -Calretinin and WT-1 stain mesothelial cells in the
background.
   - No immunoreactivity is seen for CEA, absorbed, Leu M1,
mammoglobin or
    GCDFP.
   -CK20 and TTF-1 show no immunoreactivity.  Tumor cells are
positive for
    CK7

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo F with h/o Afib, breast CA, uterine CA both in remission
admitted from ED with Afib with RVR, SBO, leukocytosis, and also
with pleural fluid results from prior admission showing
adenocarcinoma.

# SBO: Unclear etiology but appears on CT to be [**2-20**] adhesions vs
peritoneal nodules suspicious for carcinomatosis. Pt denies N/V
before admission. She was seen by surgery and made it very clear
that she was not interested in surgery. When transferred to the
floor, she was passing flatus and has minimal output for her
NGT. It was removed on [**10-5**] and the patient tolerated a liquid
diet which was advanced and the patient had a bowel movement on
day of discharge. She did not have any nausea or vomiting.

# Leukocytosis: Though the patient was afebrile, she had an
elevated WBC count on admission and was started on levofloxacin,
vancomycin and metronidazole. Cultures were negative, there was
no evidence of infection and the WBC count trended down. Her
antibiotics were discontinued on [**10-6**] and her white count
continued to trend down and she remained afebrile.

# Atrial fibrillation: Has h/o paroxysmal AF, not on coumadin
given fall risk. She was rate controlled with IV fluids and
small amounts of beta blockers until she was taking POs and then
she was started on PO metoprolol.

# Hypovolemia: Patient was on torsemide and metolazone. She had
contraction alkalosis, hyponatremia and a concentrated appearing
CBC that resolved with IVF. She also was net fluid positive at
least 2L and was at her baseline respiratory status with
balanced Is and Os over the two days prior to discharge.

# Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure ranged
85-115. She was low even on 25 of metoprolol QID (at home was on
Toprol XL 200).  She is being discharged on Toprol XL 100mg
daily.

# CHF, chronic diastolic: Her repiratory status was stable and
she had sats in the high 90s on her home O2 level of 2 lpm via
NC. We gave her fluids only very gently and did not diurese her.
She was fluid positive about 2L over the course of her hopital
stay but after transfer to the floor she had relatively equal Is
and Os with good urine output (around 1L on day prior to
discharge)
