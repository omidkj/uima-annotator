History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with hx of a duodenal perforation/bleeding
ulcer ([**2164**]) requiring emergent exploratory laparotomy and
duodenal repair and ligation complicated by on-table cardiac
arrest who p/w duodenal ulcer bleed. The pt states that in
[**7-/2164**] he developed a "bleeding ulcer and burst artery" for
which he underwent oversewing of his duodenal ulcer c/b cardiac
arrest. Since then the pt has had no further episodes of GI
bleed.
.
On Monday the pt had hematemesis and BM with BRBPR. He presented
to [**Hospital3 3583**] where he was found to have SBPs in the 70s.
He underwent EGD showing mild erosive esophagitis, gastritis
with a nonbleeding ulcer in the stomach antrum, and large
duodenal bulb ulcer extending from the bulb into the apexwith a
visible vessel. 16-17cc of 1:10,000 epi were injected and an
endoclip was placed over the bleeding vessel. The pt was
discharged on Protonix [**Hospital1 **] and sucralfate.
.
Friday early morning the pt had a black tarry BM associated with
lightheadedness, followed by multiple episodes of hematochezia.
He became increasingly lightheaded and presented to [**Hospital1 3325**]. The pt arrived a noon with HR 130 and SBP in the 80s,
and was found to have a HCT 21.3. He was given 4u pRBCs, 2u FFP,
and 3L NS, started on a protonix gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for eval from IR and surgery.
.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the pt was 97 140/93 24 98%RA. His HCT was 31.7
and he was without active bleeding. IR, GI, and Surgery were
made aware. The Gi attg spoke with the [**Hospital3 3583**] GI who
felt that the ulcer was too large and friable to manage
endoscopically. IR felt that they should be a last resource as
they are rarely effective in upper GI bleeds. Surgery
recommended initial management by GI and IR.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 52 year old gentleman with a history of a duodenal
perforation/bleeding ulcer ([**2164**]) that required emergent
exploratory laparotomy with some type of oversewing of the
ulcer. He had an unknown ulcer operation at that time that was
aborted due to on-table cardiac arrest. At this time he p/w
another major duodenal ulcer bleed.

He initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] about [**10-28**] with a GI
bleed. He was found to have a large duodenal ulcer with a
'visible vessel' which was injected with epi and clipped, and he
was started on a PPI and sucralfate. He was discharged to home
soon thereafter.  At the time of presentation he had a HCT of 24
which was transfused up to 36.8 at discharge.  The patient
remained stable until the morning [**11-1**] when he redeveloped a
major bleed with simultaneous bright red hematemesis and
hematochezia. He was found to have a hct of 21. He was
transfused and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. He
received 1 unit PRBC in the emergency room.

Upon admission to the medical intensive care unit, he was made
NPO and given intravenous fluids.  He remained hemodynamically
stable without further evidence of bleeding.  IR was consulted
to evaluate the source of the bleeding, but there was no
dominant artery on CTA supplying the ulcer that could be
embolized so they declined. GI felt they had nothing to offer
the patient.

On [**2171-11-3**], the patient was taken to the OR for repair of
duodenal ulcer. Please see operative report for further details.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the floor and
did well. Pain was an issue and his PCA was increased for better
pain control. He was kept NPO/IVF and NGT was in place. He was
hemodynamically stable with good uop. POD 2, patient began to
have flatus, pain was improved. NGT was removed and UGI was
performed that showed no leak, but poor gastric emptying
