History of Present Illness:
71 yo M w/ PMH HTN, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and digoxin,
GI bleed on vioxx, Parkinson's Disease who was visiting his
family from [**State 2748**] when he collapsed in the hotel lobby and
hit his head. When the EMT's arrived, he was unresponsive with
agonal breathing and in cardiac arrest. He was intubated and
given atropine. In the ambulance, he had sinus bradycardia and
was given epi x4/atropine x4, he then went into polymorphic VT
and then torsades. He was shocked 4 times, given magnesium,
bicarb and lidocaine and converted to sinus tachycardia. On
arrival to [**Hospital1 **] ED, the ECG showed NSR with aterolateral ST
depressions. Initial CE were negative but subsequent CK rose to
285 with MB 8.1 and troponin I rose to 0.7. He was taken to the
cath lab at [**Hospital1 **] this am (admitted pm [**5-19**])and was found to
have a right dominant system with a single vessel disease w/
complex ulcerated serial high grade (90%) stenoses of the
proximal LAD with preserved antegrade flow. Arterial sheath was
sutured in place and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. At [**Hospital1 18**], he
was taken to the cath lab where he received 2 overlapping cypher
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] 3.5 x 28 mm and 3.0 x 13 mm in the mid-proximal LAD.
Mildly slowed flow was treated successfully with intracoronary
nitroglycerin and adenosine. He was also started on clinda for a
?of aspiration pna on cxr.  Of note after the patient had an NGT
placed, bright red blood was noted in the tube. GI was consulted
and felt it was due to trauma.  Per the OSH records, the patient
had not been feeling well over the past few days with decreased
appetite and loose stools. He had 2 vodka-tonics on the day of
admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course is summarized below:

Besides his NSTEMI, his hospital course has been notable for
urotrauma from foley self DC, for traumatic NG tube placment
which GI did not feel required endoscopic evaluation. His
respiratory status was complicated by desaturations thought to
be secondary to mucus plugging on [**5-20**] and volume overload. He
was weaned and extubated on [**5-24**], but intermittently needed
bipap for hypercarbia, especially at night. Surgery was
consulted on [**5-24**] for abdominal distention with dilated cecum,
which was likley air ileus which improved after stopping bipap.
On [**5-27**] he pulled his foley and exsanguinated through his foley,
requiring 5 units of pRBC's and placement of foley. His
respiratory status was improving and called out to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6. He
was doing well until 4 am on [**5-29**], when he had a PEA arrest. He
was given epi and atropine which converted him to SVT,
intubated, and then he was shocked twice and moved back into the
ICU. This event was
