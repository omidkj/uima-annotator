History of Present Illness:
51 year old male who has a history of a heart murmur for his
entire life. Has had echocardiograms the last couple of years
after increasing intensity of his mitral regurgitation murmur
was
noted. Recent echocardiograms have shown severe mirtral
regurgitation with a flail P2 and torn chordae. He is currently
asymptomatic but given state of his regurgitation along with
dilated left atrium he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
evaluation
in [**2110-1-19**]. He returns now for preadmission testing for
surgery on [**2110-6-9**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2110-6-9**] Intra-op TEE:
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There
is moderate/severe P2 leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is
partial P3 mitral leaflet flail. An eccentric, anteriorly
directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS:
Biventricular systolic function remains normal. There is a ring
prosthesis in the mitral position. With initial post bypass
loading conditions there was significant [**Male First Name (un) **] with LVOT
velocities >3 m/sec. With volume and increase of SBP from 80 to
110 the [**Male First Name (un) **] decreased, with LVOT gradient ~15 mm Hg. No early
closure of the AV, LVOT patent on 3D images. Trace residual MR.
The study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass
  I [**Male First Name (un) 91932**] that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
