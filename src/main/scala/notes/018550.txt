Date of Birth:  [**2056-3-12**]             Sex:   F

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sotalol / lisinopril

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
hyponatremia and lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2128-5-27**] right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 100868**] is a 72F with history of end-stage non-ischemic
dilated CMP w/ EF 20%, complete heart block s/p PPM/ICD, and
primary effusion lymphoma s/p chemotherapy ([**2128-4-29**]) who now
presents with hyponatremia to 120 and [**Last Name (un) **] with creatinine to 3.0
from baseline 1.6-1.9. She has been abiding by her fluid
restriction and has been seeing Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
all of her scheduled appointments. She has not gained very much
weight, (weight was 83.9 lbs on [**5-11**] and today 89 lbs on bed
scale). Her breathing is stable, but her appetite has decreased.
 She has been lethargic for about 5-7 days.

Exam in the ED was notable for no JVD, mildly decreased lung
sounds to bases likely representative of bilateral pleural
effusions, [**1-9**]+ LE edema. III/VI systolic murmur with blunted
S2. Quite lethargic, arouses to voice.

Spoke with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] about her. She has end-stage heart failure
and the family (mainly her son [**Name (NI) **], primary caretaker) has
been somewhat resistant to the idea of how sick she is. She is
not English-speaking and a continuing goals of care discussion
with her and her son will be very important before she gets
sicker. We agreed to try hypertonic saline VERY slowly to try to
avoid volume overload but make her feel better (raise her
sodium). Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] also wants to start tolvaptan to see if this
will work. Patient is confirmed DNR/DNI (per son and HPC
[**Name (NI) **]).
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.0, 69, 110/72, 16, 100% RA.
Labs and imaging significant for Na 120, Cr 3.1.  Urine lytes
had a Na of less than 10 with an osmolality 320 in the face of
serum osmoles 300 (inappropriate concentration in the face of
hyponatremia and volume overload).  Patient given 3% hypertonic
saline in the ED with  slight improvement in mental status and
Na increase to 122 over several hours.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is awake and interactive.  She
does not have chest pain, orthopnea, shortness of breath, or
palpitations.  She understands what is happening with her heart,
sodium, and kidneys.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain although she does not walk much
at home. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.  She does have ankle edema and PND x1 the day PTA.

PERTINENT IMAGING
[**2128-5-27**] TTE:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15-20 %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
