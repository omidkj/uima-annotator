Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Coreg Cr

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
Drop in HCT and generalized weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Selective coronary artery angiography with right and left heart
catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 48684**] was admitted to the medical floor after presenting
with a drop in her Hct and generalized weakness x 1 week. In the
ED her initial vitals were T 98 BP 134/73 AR 82 RR 18 O2 sat 98%
RA. Denies bloody or black tarry stools. Upon transfer to the
medical floor, she became acutely SOB. Her BP was 170/90 with
oxygen saturation of 84-85% on RA. Cxray at the time consistent
with pulmonary edema. She was given Lasix 20mg IV x2 and
Morphine with mild improvement in her symptoms. She was
transferred to the MICU for non-invasive ventilation and closer
monitoring. ABG at this time was 7.34/44/56. She was immediately
placed on non-invasive ventilation.
.
Upon further questioning the patient denies any fevers, chills,
chest pain, SOB, PND, or orthopnea. She does admit to increasing
LE edema over the past several days. She has been compliant with
all her medications.

[**2143-7-22**] EKG:
Technically difficult study
Probable sinus arrhythmia
First degree A-V block - intraventricular conduction delay
Late R wave progression - consider anterior myocardial
infarction
QT interval prolonged for rate
ST-T wave changes are nonspecific
Since previous tracing of [**2143-5-13**], QTc interval may be
miscalulated on last tracing
.
[**7-23**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Comparison to the previous study from [**2143-7-23**] at
8:16 a.m. Interstitial densities in the lungs bilaterally are
essentially unchanged or slightly worse compared to the previous
exam, possibly reflecting mild worsening in pulmonary edema. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Retrocardiac opacity
is compatible with consolidation and/or atelectasis. There is a
left-sided pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. Hilar
contours are stable. Osseous structures are within normal
limits.

IMPRESSION:
Slight increase in interstitial markings is compatible with
slightly worsened pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity
compatible with consolidation and/or atelectasis. Left-sided
pleural effusion, stable.
.
[**2143-7-24**] Cardiac cath:
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed
two-vessel disease.
--The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--The mid-LAD had a 60% tubular lesion with a small aneurysm.
--The LCx had no angiographically apparent disease.
--The RCA was a large dominant vessel with a complex 90%
stenosis in the
mid-RCA.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated RVEDP of 9
mmHg.
Elevated left-sided filling pressures were observed, with a PCWP
mean of
20 mmHg.  There was mild pulmonary arterial systolic
hypertension with
PASP of 39 mmHg.  The PVR was mildly elevated at 168
dynes-sec/cm5.  The
SVR was within normal limits at 1053 dynes-sec/cm5.  Systemic
arterial
pressures were normal.  The cardiac index was preserved at 2.6
L/min/m2.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a Driver
(3.5x24mm)
bare metal stent which was postdilated to 3.75 mm.  Final
angiography
revealed a focal 10% residual stenosis, no angiographically
apparent
dissection and TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Two-vessel coronary artery disease.
2.  Elevated left-sided filling pressures
3.  Mild pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension.
4.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA vessel with a
bare metal
stent.
5.  Patient should be maintained on aspirin 325mg daily.
Patient should
also remain on plavix 75mg po daily for a minimum of 1 month,
preferably
3-6 months.
.
[**2143-7-25**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-5-2**],
left ventricular function appears similar.
.
[**7-29**] CXR:
There is continued mild congestive failure, although this
appears to be slightly improved since the prior study. There is
continued moderate opacification of the right upper lobe, which
could represent focal pneumonia. The heart is mildly enlarged.
Small right pleural effusion, improved with residual minimal
blunting of the right costophrenic angle.

IMPRESSION:
1. Improved congestive failure.
2. Right upper lobe infiltrate concerning for pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 48684**] is an 84yo female with PMH significant for CAD, DM
2, and HTN who originally presented for work up for low Hct and
weakness. She subsequently became acutely SOB on the floor and
was found to have flash pulmonary edema. Pt was transferred to
the MICU. An EKG showed new ST depressions in the inferior leads
suggestive of underlying ischemia. Pt was started on heparin
gtt, and her asa, BB were continued. At that time, pt refused
any interventional measures such as a cath.  Subsequently, pt
had a recurrent episode of SOB and tachypnea and found to have a
recurrent episode of pulmonary edema.  The EKG showed new T wave
inversions in teh anterior/septal leads. Pt was treated with
Lasix, morphine, nitro and asa and the heparin gtt continued. Pt
evaluated by cardiology and an echo was performed she went to
cath were a BMS was placed in her RCA.
.
NSTEMI: BMS to RCA.  Peak CK 57, peak trop 0.07.  Initially on
ASA/plavix/heparin but was crossed over from heparin to coumadin
(given h/o PE) and ASA stopped as her hct was trending down and
she was found to have guiac + stool (has not had a colonoscopy).
 Never had chest pain during her hospital course.  Continued on
Atorvastatin 40 mg daily.
.
Blood-loss and iron-deficiency anemia: Patient was initially
admitted to [**Hospital1 **] given drop in Hct from low 30's to 28. In
addition, she has been feel
