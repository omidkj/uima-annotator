CXR [**2159-12-21**]:
Large area of consolidation in the right lung base is highly
worrisome for pneumonia. The left lung is clear. Bilateral
brachiocephalic stents are stable in position.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and
mediastinal
silhouettes are stable. Innumerable rounded calcifications
projecting over
the spleen are again seen in this patient with history of prior
granulomatous disease.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lung consolidation worrisome for
infection/pneumonia. Recommend followup to resolution to exclude
underlying mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo M with HIV, ESRD s/p failed transplant, disseminated TB,
PUD, admitted to the MICU with pneumonia sepsis.

ACUTE
# Pneumonia Sepsis- Hypotension resolved on arrival to the floor
with MAP over 60 without support. Continued Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin and Zosyn for HCAP. Blood cx and sputum cx pending.
He was transferred to the floor the following day and remained
stable. Given his benign clinical course, it's unlikely he
needed zosyn for the pseudomonas coverage. He was discharged
back home with plans to continue vanco and levaquin dosed after
HD.

CHRONIC
# HIV - continued HAART: Abacavir, efavirenz, lamivudine,
zidovudine. Last CD4 308 in [**11/2159**], with below 100 viral load.
Continued Dapsone prophylaxis.

# Renal transplant - continued prednisone and Tacrolimus.
Creatinine at baseline.
Continued Nephrocaps, cinacalcet.
