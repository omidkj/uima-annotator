Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
"fluid leaking from legs"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
On the morning of [**2130-1-23**] (2 days PTA), Ms.[**Name (NI) 21862**] mother
discovered that [**Known firstname 47168**] sheets were drenched with fluid from
her legs and feet. She noted that her socks were so sodden that
"you could wring them out" and that there was some skin
breakdown along her calves. She emergently scheduled an appt
with the PCP (Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 717**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) and the vascular doctor (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 92652**]for the following day. Upon presentation to the doctor,
she was sent to the ED. Her mother had noted increasing LE and
full-body edema for the past 2-3 months, so much so that she had
to buy her new pants in a larger size. She has a history of LE
brawny edema(L>R)and blanching erythema over the past 10 yrs,
but never as severe or with leakage of fluid. She presented to
[**Company 191**] on [**2129-12-28**] for this increasing edema, and her regular dose
of furosemide was increased from 150 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 240 mg [**Hospital1 **].
However, the swelling worsened. Her mother also noted that she
began to develop a "pimply rash" along her left calf and that it
seemed to be itchy. She has been treating it with a topical
antiseptic. Per her mother, she has not had any SOB, CP, or
increased DOE. Pt denies PND or orthopnea, but wears a Bipap
machine at night for past 20 yrs. Other symptoms include a dry
cough that occasionally leads to post-tussive emesis, and some
loose stools. Her blood pressure is usually 120/80, but over the
wknd it was 140/84. She has been afebrile.
.
She has had UTIs in the past, but only every [**4-13**] yrs.
.
In the ED, urinalysis showed 21-25 WBCs, 21-25 RBCs. Dipstick
showed prot 500. CXR showed possible atelectasis vs infiltrate.
She was given cipro 500 mg and ceftriaxone 1 gm.
.
ROS: No nausea, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, positive for
pain in R knee when walking.

CT Chest [**1-26**]: IMPRESSION:

1. Limited study. Poorly defined nodules are likely secondary to
bronchopneumonia. However, along with several more well-defined
nodules, the differential diagnosis includes fungal and Nocardia
infection as well as metastatic disease. Short-term followup CT
after treatment for infection is recommended.

2. Peripheral and basilar honeycombing is consistent with
interstitial fibrosis. It demonstrates mild progression since
the prior examinations six years earlier. Such slow progression
favors a fibrotic subtype of NSIP over UIP.

3. Mild hydrostatic pulmonary edema.

[**1-26**]: Films of hand:
3 VIEWS RIGHT HAND: There is moderate to severe degenerative
disease of the right hand. Juxta-articular osteopenia and
moderate to severe joint space narrowing are seen within the
proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. Mild erosive changes
are most prominent at the second proximal phalangeal joint.
There is narrowing of the first CMC joint. Narrowing and partial
ankylosis is seen within the carpal bones. There is mild
subluxation at the second and fifth MCP joint. Hyperextension of
the third and fifth proximal phalangeal joints with associated
flexion of the distal phalangeal joints is consistent with "swan
neck deformity." There is mild erosion of the ulnar styloid
process.

3 VIEWS LEFT HAND: There is moderate to severe degenerative
disease of the left hand. Juxta-articular osteopenia and
moderate to severe joint space narrowing is seen within the
proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. Mild erosive changes
are most prominent at the second, third, and fourth proximal
interphalangeal joints. There is narrowing of the first CMC
joint. Narrowing and partial ankylosis is seen within the carpal
bones. There is mild subluxation at the fifth MCP joint.
Hyperextension of the proximal phalangeal joints with associated
flexion of the distal phalangeal joints is consistent with "swan
neck deformity." There is mild erosion of the ulnar styloid
process.

IMPRESSION:
1. FIndings consistent with rheumatoid arthritis.
.
RUQ U/S
1. Normal hepatic echotexture without focal lesion.
2. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
.
Renal U/S
RENAL ULTRASOUND: Study is limited due to patient's body habitus
and difficulty complying with instructions. The right kidney
measures 12.4 cm, and the left kidney measures 11.4 cm. Both
kidneys are echogenic. At least three nonobstructing calculi
measuring up to 8 mm are present within the lower pole of the
left kidney. There is no hydronephrosis or solid renal masses. A
foley catheter is seen within a collapsed bladder.

IMPRESSION:
1. Limited examination. Three nonobstructing calculi within the
lower pole of the left kidney.
2. Echogenic kidneys, suggestive of underlying renal parenchymal
disease.
.
[**1-26**] Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflet(3)appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitra
