CT head ([**2-25**]): Again seen is parafalcine subdural hematoma.
Subdural hematoma is also again seen layering over the entire
left convexity, as well as subjacent to both occipital lobes,
above the tentorium. This appears slightly thicker at the vertex
when compared to prior study, where it measures approximately 7
mm in greatest thickness. There is approximately 3 mm rightward
shift of the septum pellucidum. Subdural hematoma also seen
layering along the posterior right parietal region. Scattered
linear foci of hyperdensity within the sulci are again seen,
consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage in a non-aneurysmal
distribution. There is no evidence of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage or contusion. Ventricles and cisterns appear within
normal limits.
There is no skull fracture. Moderate mucosal thickening is seen
within the
frontal and ethmoid sinuses. Mucosal thickening with fluid
levels in the left greater than right maxillary sinus are noted.
 Severe mucosal thickening also is seen in the right sphenoid
sinus.

CT head ([**3-3**]): Bifrontal extra-axial hematomas have evolved and
now are slightly hypodense compared to the prior study.  There
is no significant mass effect on the underlying brain.
Collections appear to have mildly increased in size compared to
the prior study and measure approximately 7-9 mm in greatest
dimension compared to prior measurements of [**4-18**] mm.
There is stable hemorrhage along the tentorial reflection.
Previously noted biparietal subdural hematomas have evolved in
density but are stable to minimally decreased in size.  There is
stable mild midline shift to the left.
No new hematomas are seen.
Minimal subarachnoid hemorrhage is unchanged.  There is a small
fluid level in the left maxillary sinus which appears new.
Right-sided sphenoid sinus inflammatory disease has improved.

Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
small. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo man with HTN, diet-controlled DM2, mild Alzheimer's and
mild Parkinson's disease presented after a fall that led to
traumatic subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages.

## SAH/SDH: The pt was initially admitted to the neurosurgical
service. After being stabilized, he developed hypoxemia and
fevers that were attributed to aspiration. In addition, he
developed a UTI, diarrhea and acute renal failure. He was
started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, metronidazole
and ciprofloxacin)and transferred to the MICU. There, he was
again stabilized, and his hypoxemia resolved, as did his ARF. He
was transferred out to the medical floor. He improved daily
until he went for IR-guided J-tube placement, at which time he
again aspirated. His clinical status deteriorated, and he was
made comfort measures. Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin were
continued. He recovered from this event, and began to improve
again. A surgical J-tube was placed, and tube feeds were
started. He completed his course of antibiotics. He was started
on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis on admission. He again
aspirated, this time a large amount. This led to significant
respiratory distress, and, after discussing with the family, he
was made comfort care and expired.
