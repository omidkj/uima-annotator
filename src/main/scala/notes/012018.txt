Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
CP, SOB -> inutbated @ OSH and transferred for emergent cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, IABP, tunneled line [**2124-2-22**]
cardiac catheterization with ECMO support [**2124-3-3**]
R IJ tunnelled dialysis catheter


History of Present Illness:
68 yo male w/ history of DM, HTN, NSTEMI [**1-11**] wks ago who
developed chest pain and shortness of breath on [**2123-2-22**]. On
evening of [**2-21**] developed "heart burn" before going to bed.
Awoke on evening [**Date range (1) 15001**] acutely short of breath, partially
relieved by nitro. Was able to sleep sitting up, but then early
in the morning on [**2-22**] the shortness of breath returned. Called
EMS who found his O2 sats to be low, SBP 160s. He received
lasix, morphine 8 mg, ativan 1 mg and nitro paste prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 **]. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **] SBP in 60s, HR
30s. He was started on pressors and received atropine x 2. He
was also electively intubated and sedated with propofol. IABP
could not be placed at OSH [**2-11**] to poor femoral pulses. Trop was
0.59, CK flat. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on levophed and
dopamine with SBP in the 70-80s. Vent settings on transfer: AC
TV 600/ RR 18/ FiO2 100%/ 0 PEEP.
.
In the cath lab found to have severe 3 vessel disease, which was
not stented. Elevated wedge at 65 - received lasix, nipride, and
nitro gtt. IABP placed and pressure improved to 30. TEE was done
in lab and showed anterior wall hypokineses, mild AI and mod MR,
which improved when IABP was restarted. When patient was bolused
with versed in the cath lab became hypotensive requiring
discontinuation of nitroprusside and nitro gtts; dopamine was
restarted. Patient was transferred from cath lab to CCU
intubated w/ balloon pump in place.

C.Cath [**2124-2-22**]:
1. Severe left main and a three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock requiring IABP for hemodynamic support.
3. Severe systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
4. Severe MR improved with IABP and diuresis.
.
Echo [**2124-2-22**]:
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with severe hypokinesis of the anterior wall, apex, lateral wall
and basal to mid inferior walls. The distal inferior and basal
anteroseptal walls contract best. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (EF 20-25%) The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric jet of moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Carotid u/s [**2124-2-23**]: Minimal bilateral ICA calcific plaque, no
appreciable associated stenosis, however (graded as less than
40% bilaterally).
.
RUQ u/s [**2124-2-27**]: 1. Limited study due to patient immobility and
intubated status. However, no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of
cholecystitis

underexpansion
with high risk of restenosis.

Trans-esophageal echo [**2124-3-3**]:
1.  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.  There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex, mid and
apical portions of the inferolateral, lateral and inferior
walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed.
3.  Right ventricular function is mildly depressed.
4.  There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
5.  The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6.  The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-11**]+)mitral regurgitation is seen.
7.  Tip of the intraortic balloon pump in good position.
8.  Post percutaneous intervention ejection fraction is slightly
improved.

R IJ tunnelled catheter placement [**2124-3-10**]:
Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided tunneled
hemodialysis catheter placement via the right internal jugular
venous approach with the tip positioned in the right atrium


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo male w/ HTN, DM, s/p recent NSTEMI who presented to OSH
after developing chest pain and SOB, intubated at OSH for
increasing hypoxia and concern for pulmonary edema.  Cardiac
cath revealed severe 3VD with decreased EF, elevated pulmonary
pressures, and thrombocytopenia.  He was not a CT surgical
candidate, so he underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with
atherectomy and placement of BMS to the LAD.
.
# Cardiogenic shock/CHF - The patient presented in shock, most
likely due to LV dysfunction secondary to underlying ischemia.
This resulted in systemic hypoperfusion, hypoxemia and lactic
acidosis.  He had elevated cardiac enzymes and severe 3 vessel
CAD at cath, felt not ammenable for stenting initially.  He was
evaluated but deemed not a CT surgical candidate, so was taken
for cath to undergo high risk intervention.  He received
rotational atherectomy with stent placement x2 (BMS).  Initially
he had increased R and L sided pressures, w/ extremely elevated
PCWP of 65; this improved after diuresis and placement of IABP.
He was started on CVVH for volume removal.  Initail echo showed
EF 25%, but repeat TEE showed improvemed EF of 35-40%, with
evidence of ant/lat wall hypokinesis, and MR.  His IABP and
pressers were weaned slowly and the patient extubated.  He was
continued on statin, Aspirin, and Plavix.  His blood pressure
remained stable and he was started on low dose b-blocker and
ACEi.  He was transfered to the floor and monitored.  He will be
discharged to rehab and scheduled for follow up with his
cardiologist at [**Hospital6 1109**], Dr. [**Fi
