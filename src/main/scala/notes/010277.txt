Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Asymptomatic

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2118-12-16**] Removal of Right Atrial Mass

History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old female with incidental finding of right
atrial mass on echocardiogram. Cardiac MRI in [**2118-11-4**]
confirmed right atrial mass. It was also notable for a bicuspid
aortic valve without aortic stenosis and only mild aortic
insufficiency at that time. Her ascending aorta was dilated. Her
left ventricular function was normal, and she had moderate
tricuspid regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Follow up TEE in [**2118-11-4**] also confirmed a penduculated
mass in the right atrium, measuring 2.0 x 1.6 centimeters. TEE
showed only mild MR, mild TR and mild AI. In preperation for
surgical intervention, she underwent cardiac catheterization in
[**2118-12-5**] which showed normal coronary arteries.

Past Medical History:
Bicuspid aortic valve with ?Dilated Asc Aorta
Hypercholesterolemia
Hypothyroidism

Social History:
No history of tobacco. Occasional ETOH. Currently employed as a
book keeper. Currently lives with her mother.

Family History:
No history of premature coronary artery disease

[**2118-12-20**] Chest x-ray Small bilateral pleural effusions. Heart
size normal unchanged, with probable left atrial enlargement. No
pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax. Lateral view shows small
retrosternal air and fluid collection a common postoperative
finding following median sternotomy and heart surgery.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 57806**] was admitted and taken directly to the operating room
where Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed a removal of a right atrial mass.
For further surgical details, please see seperate dictated
operative note. Following the operation, she was brought to the
CSRu for invasive monitoring. She initially required atrial
pacing for junctional rhythm. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. She
was transfused with PRBC to maintain hematocrit near 30%. Her
heart rhythm and rate improved to sinus rhythm in the 60-80
range. Her CSRU course was otherwise uneventful and she
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day two. She remained
mostly in a normal sinus rhythm but occasional periods of
accelerated juntional rhythm were noted. She also had a short
burst of atrial fibrillation on postoperative day two. Given
junctional rhythm, beta blockade was avoided. She otherwise
continued to make clinical improvements and was eventually
cleared for discharge on postoperative day four. At time of
discharge, pathology of the right atrial mass was still pending.
She will be discharged on Lasix for persistent small bilateral
effusions.
