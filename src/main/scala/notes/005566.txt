History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] with PMH CAD s/p NSTEMI, recent pna, GIB, presents
with hypotension and tachycardia. Pt recently d/c'd from [**Hospital1 **] on
[**4-19**] s/p NSTEMI which was medically managed and LLL pna, then
returned with C dif colitis on [**5-1**] and was discharged on
[**2188-5-9**]. At rehab, he had hypotension and new onset diarrhea the
day prior to admission to 61/35, and was given repeated fluid
boluses and started on empiric flagyl and ticarcillin. Prior to
admission, he developed tachycardia to the 130's, with return of
diarrhea. He had runs of SVT. He said to the staff at [**Hospital1 **]
"I just want to go to sleep and not wake up", but a discussion
was had with his son and the decision was made to transfer him
to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department for active management.
.
In the ED the patient was given 5 liters of fluids. CXR showed
persistent LLL pneumonia. He was persistently tachycardic to the
150's and was felt to be in a supraventricular tachycardia
versus atrial fibrillation, and was cardioverted at 50J once
without effect, then put on an esmolol drip with worsening
hypotension. His blood pressure continued to fall and a central
line was placed and he was started on levophedrine. He was
transferred to the ICU with clear DNR/DNI confirmation for
continuation of antibiotics, pressors, fluids, and close
monitoring.
.
In the MICU, the patient was treated broadly with
vanco/ctx/flagyl.  His OSH blood cultures grew coag negative
staph resistent to oxacillin and his stool grew cdiff.  His
antibiotics were narrowed to vanco/flagyl and his PICC was d/c.
His pressors were weaned on d2 and he maintained his pressure w/
intermittant fluid boluses.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim showed him to be an
appropriate responder.  He became tachycardic and was noted to
be in aflutter/afib w/ RVR.  He was treated initially with a
diltiazem gtt but this was stopped when his BP dropped.  After
this he was given dilt and metoprolol boluses but also
experienced hypotension with these and was started on an
amiodarone gtt.  This was stopped on the evening prior to call
out and he was transitioned to oral amiodarone.

CXR [**2188-5-23**]: IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2188-5-2**]:
Asbestos-related pleural calcification obscures large regions of
both lungs which are otherwise clear.  The heart is top normal
size. Transvenous right ventricular and right atrial pacer leads
follow their expected courses. Indentation of the trachea at the
thoracic inlet, suggests an enlarged thyroid gland.  No
pneumothorax or pleural effusion is present.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] year old man with recent hospitalizations for C diff,
NSTEMI, and pneumonia presented with septic shock, AFib with RVR
and hypotension.
.
1. Septic shock - The patient presented w/ hypotension and grew
MRSA.  Also had cdiff colitis on admission.  Was initially fluid
repleted and started on pressors but these were weaned quickly
by HD2.  He was initially covered broadly with CTX, vancomycin,
and flagyl but the CTX was withdrawn when his culture data
returned.  He is to complete 2wk courses of both vancomycin and
flagyl as an outpatient.  He had an appropriate response to a
cortisol stim test and, thus, was not supported w/ stress dose
steroids.  His PICC line on admission was d/c.  He has
intermittantly required small fluid boluses to maintain his UOP
> 30cc/hr but was making good amounts of urine w/out boluses
upon d/c.  His bblocker was held on admission [**3-13**] hypotension
but was restarted on d/c.
.
2. tachycardia - In afib w/ RVR on admission and cardioversion
failed in the ED.  BBlocker and diltiazem administration
resulted in dropped pressure without rate response.  He was
started on an amiodarone drip in the ICU w/ good rate control
and quickly transitioned to PO.  He has a pacer in place and
continues to be in good rate control on the floor.  He will
start his amiodarone maintenance doses on [**2188-6-9**] and will need
telemetry until this time.
.
3. Acute renal failure - He had a mild elevation of his
creatinine on admission but this trended back to baseline (0.9)
with fluid repletion.
.
4. code - DNR/DNI by discussion with PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], consistent
with previous discussions. Clarified with sons
