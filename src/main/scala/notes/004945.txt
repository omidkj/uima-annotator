Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Closed reduction of left talus fracture


History of Present Illness:
80F presenting with history of breast CA, Diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, obesity, laryngeal SCC s/p surgery & XRT p/w leg
pain after a fall at home.
.
Patient was getting into a car, lifting right leg to get into
driver's seat (!), with all weight on left leg, he leg 'buckled'
and she fell straight down onto her behind. No Dizziness,
lightheadedness, LOC. No head injury. No pain at the time of the
fall. Later that evening she awoke with severe left ankle pain.
.
Of note she also is chronically short of breath . She does not
think this has gotten worse recently. No PND, orthopnea, no
chest pain, no diaphoresis. No fevers/chills. She also notes
slow speech, and a feeling like her tongue is big and it is
difficult to make words. This started several months ago.
.
ED VS: T 97.3, HR 60, BP 166/88, RR 18, 95%/RA Given IV morphine
for pain, 1L NS, ASA and tylenol. Foot plain films demonstrated
a talus fracture. Ortho saw her, did not recommend surgery, they
did reduce her fracture, and place her leg in a brace. Neurology
was consulted for her speech changes and their consult was
pending at the time of admission. She was admitted to medicine
for shortness of breath.

ECG:
[**2119-1-18**]:
Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to the previous tracing
non-diagnostic Q waves are recorded in lead aVF. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2117-7-27**] no diagnostic interim change. The

CT Head [**2119-1-18**]:
FINDINGS:
No acute hemorrhage, midline shift, hydrocephalus, or acute
large infarct is present. The ventricles and sulci are mildly
prominent, consistent with
age-related involutional changes. The mastoid air cells and
paranasal sinuses are well aerated. No fractures are present.

IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial abnormality.

Plain films, ankle
[**2119-1-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings concerning for talus avulsion fracture. Superior
widening of the ankle mortise.
2. Suprapatellar joint effusion. Moderate knee osteoarthritic
changes,
possible chondrocalcinosis.
3. The left aspect of the pubic symphysis appears slightly
inferior in
relation to the right aspect of the pubic symphysis, of
indeterminate age.

Plain film, ankle post reduction:
[**2119-1-18**]:
LEFT ANKLE, THREE VIEWS: Cast material obscures fine bone
detail. Within
this limitation, alignment of the mortise is improved. The
possible talar
avulsion fracture is well seen due to overlying cast.

IMPRESSION: Improved alignment of the left ankle status-post
reduction.

CXR:
[**2119-1-18**]:
1. Mild bibasilar, right greater than left, atelectasis. No
focal
consolidation or pleural effusion.
2. Persistent prominence of the aortopulmonary window/main
pulmonary artery, which may be secondary to pulmonary arterial
hypertension versus pulmonary valvular stenosis.

CTA Chest
[**2119-1-20**]:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:
The heart is mildly enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate
calcification of the aortic valve and coronary artery is
present. The
ascending aorta measures 3.7 mm in diameter. Mild calcification
is present
throughout the thoracic aorta. The main pulmonary artery is
enlarged,
measuring 41 mm in diameter. No pulmonary embolism is present to
the
subsegmental levels.

Multiple mediastinal lymph nodes are present, the largest
measuring 12 mm in the subcarinal region. Scattered axillary
lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for lymphadenopathy.

Moderate centrilobular emphysema is present throughout the
lungs. There is a moderate degree of basilar, dependent
atelectasis bilaterally. Within the
left lower lobe, there is a 25 x 18 x 24 mm cavitary lesion,
which may
represent a focus of infection, neoplasm, vascular abnormality,
or septic
embolus. Given the patient's prior history of squamous cell
cancer, however, there is a high suspicion for neoplasm. There
is no pleural effusion.

Included views of the neck demonstrate multinodular goiter, with
hypodense
nodules, measuring up to 17 mm in the right lobe.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:
There is no acute fracture or dislocation. Within single right
mid thoracic
rib, there is a focal expansion up to 11 mm, with no evidence of
cortical
destruction or sclerosis. No sclerotic or lytic lesion is
detected.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe cavitary lesion is highly suspicious for
neoplasm, given
the patient's prior history of squamous cell carcinoma.
2. A 12-mm subcarinal lymph node is concerning for malignancy
given the
patient's history. Reactive lymphadenopathy is also a
possibility.
3. Focal enlargement of the mid right thoracic rib is likely a
benign entity such as fibrous dysplasia or healed injury.
4. No pulmonary embolism is detected. However, the main
pulmonary artery is
enlarged, compatible
