CTA chest: IMPRESSION:
1. Large extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, with a saddle
embolus straddling the left and right main pulmonary arteries.
The greatest clot burden in the right main and lower lobe
interlobar arteries, correlating with early infarcts in the
right middle and lower lobes.
2. Distention of the azygos vein may suggest a degree of right
heart strain, but the right ventricle is normal in size, with no
leftward deviation of the intraventricular septum.
3. Possible thrombosis in the azygos vein, which is not
opacified.
.
Bilat lower extremity ultrasounds: IMPRESSION: Right popliteal
deep venous thrombosis, with venous collateral formation around
clot. No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.
.
TTE: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventircle may be dilated.
Right ventricular free wall motion appears preserved. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Pulmonary embolism: No known risk factors.  Patient started
on heparin gtt and coumadin.  Remained hemodynamically stable
here, not significant strain on right side of heart.  Sating
wellon room air.  Patient required coumadin 10mg daily to become
therapeutic.  Will need follow up of INR as outpatient.  Follow
up with PCP for further work up re: coagulopathy and malignancy
risk factors (especially colonoscopy).  Also consider repeat TTE
and follow up with pulmonary clinic in [**3-2**] months to evaluate R
heart strain.
.
2) HTN: Normotensive during this admission.  Patient more
bradycardic as well and EKG obtained and reviewed with
cardiology who did not feel there were acute new changes.  All
BP meds still held at time of discharge and should follow up as
outpatient.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Bilateral pulmonary emboli with saddle embolus
Right lower extremity DVT
Mod PA systolic hypertension


Discharge Condition:
Good


Discharge Instructions:
You were found to have a large pulmonary embolism and deep vein
thrombosis (DVT) in your right leg.  We are still uncertain why
you developed these and recommend once you have them further
treated to get further evaluation by your primary care doctor.
If you develop chest pain, shortness of breath please return to
the hospital or call your doctor.
.
Your blood pressure has remained in the normal range during your
hospital stay.  For that reason do not restart your blood
pressure medications until you next see your primary care doctor
and cardiologist and they can make the decision whether to
restart them.
.
Please come back to the outpatient lab here at [**Hospital1 18**] and have
your blood drawn to check your INR on [**2156-5-13**].  The results will
be sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4844**] and his clinic will contact you if you
need to change your coumadin dose.
