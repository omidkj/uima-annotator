History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with medical
history pertinent for CAD, Chronic Systolic CHF, CKD and DM who
presents with lower GI bleed. Patient began to feel ill and weak
yesterday evening and began to have diarrhea. Diarrhea was noted
to be mixed with bright red blood. He thinks that he had > 5
episodes yesterday. Also had multiple episodes of non-bloody
emesis yesterday. Patient denies associated symptoms including
chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain. Patient denies
any travel outside of the country recently. He does report
ingesting egg salad on Sunday night which was apparently made
with 2 week old eggs. No one else consumed the egg salad and no
one else is sick in his family. This morning, he felt so weak
that he was not able to stand up-- felt like his legs could not
hold up his weight-- and so he asked his wife to call his PCP
who recommended that he come to the ED.
.
In the ED, patient was hemodynamically stable with BRBPR in
rectal vault. No active bleeding was noted. GI saw the patient
in the ED and reccomended admission with serial crits. Patient
was given kayelexate given elevated K on repeat chemistry and
given 2L IVF. On the floor, patient was found to be sitting on
sheets soaked in bright red blood. A trigger was called on
arrival. He remained hemodynamically stable with SBP in the 100s
and paced rhythm. MICU transfer was requested for closer
monitoring.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient complains of feeling hungry
and thirsty. He has SOB but notes that this is chronic for him
and unchanged. Denies chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain,
dysuria, arthralgias, or myalgias.

STUDIES:
CXR:
Single bedside AP chest radiograph re-demonstrates multiple
sternotomy wires, vascular clips from previous coronary arterial
bypass graft and biventricular pacer with leads terminating in
appropriate position. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
unchanged. Atherosclerotic calcification is noted at the aortic
arch. A left retrocardiac opacity is significantly improved
since [**2197-3-3**], though small opacity in that
distribution persists, likely atelectatic. Otherwise, the lungs
are clear. Visualized osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable.

EKG: v-paced at 82 with PVC, ?peaked TW in V3-V5


Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly this is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with CAD, Chronic Systolic
CHF, CKD, DM, h/o colon cancer s/p remote colectomy with
radiation proctitis with who initially presented with lower GI
bleed. Patient with previous history of lower GI bleed had
colonoscopy which demonstrated internal hemorrhoids, negative
capsule endoscopy and normal upper endoscopy in 4/[**2197**].
.
# Lower GI bleed - Patient is satus post colectomy with
radiation proctitis noted to have melena in the rectal vault in
the ED and then was found to be actively bleeding upon arrival
to the medicine floor. Patient was hemodynamically stable
however had multiple comorbid conditions. Patient had previous
bleed 4-5 months ago and had negative capsule endoscopy with
some internal hemorrhoids. Endoscopy was negative at that time.
Colonoscopy demonstrated internal hemorrhoids. Hct at initial
presentation was  35 which is well above his baseline crit of
mid 20s. Patient was hemodynamically stable but refused NGT
lavage.  He was transfered to the MICU for closer monitoring of
his lower GI bleeding.  In the MICU, patient was initially kept
NPO with Q8Hour hct which were stable.  IV access was maintained
with two large bore IVs.  Patient was also found to have a
leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16 and abdominal pain.  He was
evaluated by GI.  GI felt that the clinical picture was most
consistent with ischemic or infectious colitis and therefore
colonoscopy or endoscopy was not necessary.  Patient did not
have any further episodes of bright red blood per rectum and his
Hct remained stable.  He was transfered back to the floor where
[**Hospital1 **] Hct were checked.  He was placed back on his home
cardioproctective medications slowlying including asa, beta
blocker, and ACE-I.  Patient's Hct remained stable, his WBC
count trended to normal, and his abdominal pain resolved.  He
was transitioned to a regular diet which he tolerated well.
.
# Hyperkalemia - Patient initially with elevated K on arrival of
6.0, however this was a hemolysed specimen.  Repeat K was 4.7.
This elevated is likely secondary to acute on chronic renal
failure in the setting of lower GI bleed. Patient got kayelexate
in the ED which normalized his K. He never had any EKG changes.

.
#. Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease (Stage III): Cr on admission
2.9 which is above baseline values of 1.5-2.0. Likely related to
volume depletion in the setting of lower GI bleed. Potassium
elevated to 6.0 on admission repeat K 5.9. Previous K was
4.6-5.6.  Initially patient's ACE I was held and his was treated
with gentle IVF.  His Cr returned to its baseline of 1.5 by time
of discharge.
.
#. Chronic Systolic CHF, biventricular heart failure, EF 40%.
