MICROBIOLOGY [**3-8**]:

Stool: + Cdiff toxin
Blood Cultures: Pending
Sputum Cx: pending
Urine: Negative
=========
ECG:
Probable multifocal atrial tachycardia. Low limb lead QRS
voltage. Left axisdeviation may be due to left anterior
fascicular block and/or possible prior inferior myocardial
infarction. Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS
transition is non-specific. Since the previous tracing of
[**2178-3-8**] there is probably no significant change.
==========
IMAGING:

CXR:
Indwelling devices are unchanged in position, and
cardiomediastinal
contours are stable in appearance. Worsening opacity in left
retrocardiac
region is likely due to a combination of atelectasis and small
pleural
effusion, but infectious pneumonia should also be considered in
the
appropriate clinical setting.

CT Torso:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or dissection. Aneurysm of
the ascending
aorta. Trace pericardial fluid.
2. Dilated, ahaustral, and hypoenhancing segments of the sigmoid
colon with
bowel wall thickening and adjacent fat stranding, concerning for
infectious
process, less likely ischemia.
3. Enlarged prostate with prostatic stent. Foley catheter ends
proximal to
stent with balloon inflated within the prostate.
4. Small atrophic bilateral kidneys.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo male presenting with altered mental status, hypotension
and hypoxia. Patient required emergent intubation, central line
placement, and initiation of pressors in emergency department. A
CT abdomen showed thickening of the sigmoid colon with
surrounding fat stranding suggesting inflammatory process. On
exam abdomen was distended and guarded. Given high suspicion for
CDiff he was given PO Vancomycin and IV flagyl. Patient was seen
and evaluated by the general surgical service. The surgical team
discussed option of surgical intervention with the [**Hospital 228**]
health care proxy who ultimately decided that surgery was too
aggressive. [**Name (NI) **] HCP decided on DNR/DNI code status. The
patient was admitted to the MICU where he was aggressively
hydrated and continued on vasopressor support (a total of 3
vasopressors were eventually needed). Hemodynamics were further
complicated by MAT for which he was started on IV amiodarone.
Despite aggressive fluid resucitation and eventual initiation of
a total of three vasopressors patient remained hypotensive with
a rising lactate. [**Name (NI) **] HCP decided on comfort measures at
which time vasopressor support was stopped and patient died soon
after. His HCP requested an autospy be performed. Notably,
Clostridium Difficile toxin returned positive.
