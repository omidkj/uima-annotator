Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
aspiration s/p intubation for [**First Name3 (LF) **]


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2109-1-8**] [**Month/Day/Year **] and intubation
[**2109-1-11**] Placement of post pyloric Doppoff feeding tube
[**2109-1-16**] Dobhoff replacement in post pyloric position
[**2109-1-19**] Extubation
[**2109-1-20**] Pulled Dobhoff feeding tube

History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year-old male with a history of depression who was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after [**Hospital Unit Name **] complicated by aspiration and
hypoxic respiratory failure.  Briefly, this patient was admitted
to an outside hospital initially with abdominal pain and concern
for choleycystitis.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2108-12-31**] for
[**Date Range **] as there was a presumed stone in the CBD, but no stone was
seen.  Therefore, he was transferred back to [**Hospital1 392**] and
underwent a laparascopic choleycystectomy.  This procedure was
complicated by a very friable gallbladder and a persistent by
duct leak.  He was then transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] for stenting.
He was intubated for his procedure.  During a successful stent
placement he vomited and aspirated.  Anesthesia performed a
bronchoscopy and there was a significant quantity of bile in the
RML.  He was transferred to the ICU on a ventilator given
concern he would develop [**Doctor Last Name **]/ARDS after his severe aspiration
event.  His vent settings at the time of transfer were AC, Tv
600,RR 14,PEEP 8,FiO2 100%.  ABG was 7.42/45/207.

[**2109-1-8**] [**Month/Day/Year **]: IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent bile leak from the cystic duct stump with contrast
directed
away from the drainage catheter.
2. Status post cholecystectomy with cholecystectomy clips and
drainage
catheter at the end of the cystic duct remnant.
3. On this study the tip of the endotracheal tube is near the
right main stem bronchus however on radiographs from subsequent
days, the tip of the
endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned.

[**2109-1-10**]: CT Abdomen and Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis characterized by lack of enhancement
of the
pancreatic head, neck and proximal body with marked
peripancreatic
inflammatory stranding.
2. No evidence of hematoma in the abdomen or pelvis. The
previously
described abnormality in Morison's pouch likely represented the
surgical drain in this region.
3. Multifocal nodular opacities throughout the bilateral lung
fields, near-
complete consolidation of the bilateral lower lobes and small
bilateral
pleural effusions. These findings are suspicious for an
infectious etiology and given the bibasilar consolidation,
aspiration pneumonia is suspected.
4. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

[**2109-1-14**]: CT Torso
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening of diffuse patchy alveolar opacities
throughout both
lungs and persistent bibasilar consolidations concerning for
pneumonia.
Aspiration pneumonia remains a diagnostic consideration.
2. CT evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis as previously
described. Although the study was not specifically tailored to
assess the enhancement of the pancreas, decreased areas of
enhancement in the head and body are again evident. Enlarged
mesenteric lymph nodes likely reactive and related to ongoing
inflammatory and/or infectious process. Markedly attenuated SMV.

3. Prominence of the left intrahepatic biliary ducts in the
setting of a
biliary stent, could represent obstruction, but unchanged.
4. Anasarca and increase in bilateral pleural effusions and
small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.

[**2109-1-14**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.


[**2109-1-25**] TTE:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No apparent valvular vegetations identified. Mild
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular
regional and global systolic function.
