Blood culture [**3-15**], [**3-16**], [**3-18**] NGTD (pending)
Urine culture [**3-17**] final negative

Imaging:
.
CXR [**3-15**]- Low lung volumes, making evaluation of the lateral
view
suboptimal. Given this, there is right>left bibasilar linear
atelectasis/scarring without definite focal consolidation.

CTA [**3-15**]-
1. No PE or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Streaky density in the right lower lobe may represent
atelectasis,
aspiration, or early infection.
3. Hepatic cysts.

CXR [**3-16**]:
Bibasilar opacities -- ? atelectasis and/or scarring -- are
unchanged. Due to respiratory motion, there is limited
assessment for focal infiltrate on the lateral view.

Renal U/S [**3-17**]:
Normal renal ultrasound. No evidence of perinephric fluid
collection.

[**3-19**] CXR (PICC placement)
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
4 French
single-lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous
approach.
Final internal length is 46.5 cm, with the tip positioned in
SVC. The line is ready to use.

[**3-20**] RUE US - no hematoma



Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo F with h/o MS presenting with shortness of breath and
chest pain, found to have sepsis with unclear infectious source,
PNA vs UTI.

# SEPSIS
Patient met SIRS criteria for septic shock on admission with
fever, white count, and tachycardia. Likely source was urinary
+/- PNA (see below). Patient denied abdominal pain, and had no
diarrhea; however, with recent antibiotics, also at risk for
c.difficile. Patient broadly covered with vancomycin, cefepime
and flagyl; flagyl stopped 4d prior to discharge with plan to
continue vanc/cefepime via PICC line for 7-day course to end
[**3-22**].
.
# HYPOTENSION
On the evening of admission patient was noted to be hypotensive
to systolic 60s. This was in the context of receiving a total of
2L ivf since admission and home lasix, hctz, furosemide as well
as her home sedating medications: seroquel, trazodone, doxepin,
tizanidine, klonopin, fexophenadine. Patient was noted to be A+O
x 1 during this episode. Due to her hypotension she was
transfe
