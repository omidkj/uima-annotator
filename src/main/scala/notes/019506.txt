Carotid Bruit        Right: -   Left: -

Pertinent Results:
[**2184-6-8**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis 0%. Left ICA stenosis
<40%.

[**2184-6-10**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). The right atrium is
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20%). with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm
from the incisors.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt.
There seems to be a bileaflet restriction. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Mitral annulus is 37mm in the
LAX view and 35 mm in the commisural view in the endsystolic
postion. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Tricuspid annulus is 40mm in the ME4C view. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results on Miss Shaughness prior to surgical incision.
Post_Bypass: Patient is on milrinone and epinephrine. Moderate
RV global hypokinesis. The tricuspid ring is in place, seated
and well functioning with no regurgitation/stenosis. The m itral
mechanical valve is in place and functioning well. The classic
washing jets are present. There is no other regurgitation. There
is no evidence of stenosis. Intact thoracic aorta. Overall LVEF
is 30% to 35%.

[**2184-6-20**] CXR: The patient is status post mitral and tricuspid
valve replacement and CABG with intact median sternotomy wires.
The heart is stably enlarged. Retrocardiac opacity likely
representing atelectasis persists. Again seen are small
bilateral pleural effusions which are not appreciably changed.
Clips are noted in the right axilla.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from outside hospital to [**Hospital1 18**]
for operative management. Upon admission she was medically
managed and underwent appropriate pre-operative work-up. Given
her acute left ventricular dysfunction and her history of
radiation and chemo therapy for breast cancer, a left
ventricular biopsy was also planned to look for myocardial
changes related to that treatment. On [**6-10**] she was brought to the
operating Room where she underwent mitral valve replacement,
tricuspid valvuloplasty, Coronary bypass graft x 1, left
ventricular biopsy and resection of Left atrial appendage.
Please see operative report for details. Following surgery she
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. She initially did require inotropes and pressors but
these were weaned off on post-op day one. On post-operative day
one she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. Beta-blockers and diuretics were initiated and
she was diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Coumadin was
initiated and a Heparin infusion was utilized as a bridge while
Coumadin was loaded. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires
were removed per protocol. She developed rapid atrial
fibrillation which was treated with IV and po amiodarone. She
then required cardioversion to SR on post-op day 11. She was
evaluated by Physical Therapy and cleared for discharge to home.
Arrangements were made for her Coumadin management by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 8579**]. Precautions, restrictions, medications and follow up
were discussed with her prior to discharge.
