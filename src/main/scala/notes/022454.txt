Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intensive Care Unit Therapy


History of Present Illness:
HPI:
Patient is a 53 year old female with past medical history
significant for diabetes, CAD, sarcoidosis, and tracheostomy,
who presents with acute worsening of shortness breath.
.
Of note, she wsa recently admitted on [**2189-12-12**] and discharged on
[**2189-12-19**] for chief complaint of hemoptysis. She underwent a
bronchoscopy at that time which did not reveal any source of
active bleeding. A CTA was completed at that time, which could
not rule out subsegement total PE. Her CTA did demonstrate
several new findings of ground glass opacities. Her BAL at that
time grew out >100,000 MRSA and pseudomonas, however it was felt
that she was chronically colonized with the flora. She also had
acute renal failure during her admission, which resolved.
.
ED Course: Patient's vital signs in ED were : T 99.3, BP 175/94,
RR 28, HR 94, and Ox Sat of 95% on NRB. She was given PO
levofloxacin, prednisone, and 40 mg IV lasix. A heparin gtt was
started for presumed PE, and morphine was given for pain. She
was also initated on a nitroglycerin gtt.

The tracheostomy remains in the midline. There are surgical
clips in the mediastinum. The heart appears enlarged. There is
stable pulmonary vascular congestion, left basilar atelectasis
or infiltrate, and left greater than right pleural effusion,
underlying pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in this
setting.

MICROBIOLOGY
ESBL E coli

Brief Hospital Course:
ACUTE, DISTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
Patient had several potential causes of her dyspnea, including
pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, hypoventilation secondary to
obesity, asthma/COPD exacerbation, progressive sarcoid,
superinfection (r/o viral, r/o MRSA, Pseudomonas), and anxiety
related among others. With an elevated BNP and CXR showing
worsening interstitial pattern, the patient was diuresed with
improvement. She responded to 40mg IV lasix, titrated to ~2L
negative per day. Her renal function should be closely monitored
given acute renal failure that developed last admission.  Upon
discharge she was converted to an oral lasix regimen, and
continued to diurese heavily.  Urine output and volume status
should be closely monitored and lasix adjusted accordingly.
Creatinine upon discharge was 1.2

DIABETES
Patient usually takes 64 units of lantus at 10pm daily, along
with novolog sliding scale, the details of which she is unsure
of. She was continued on her home lantus and a humalog sliding
scale.

TRACHEOSTOMY
The patient's trach was changed during this admission to allow
for mechanical ventilation if needed, which was not the case.

ABNORMAL URINALYSIS / ?UTI
The patient  had an abnormal U/A, as she had in the past. The
Foley catheter was changed and repeat cultures were sent. This
again grew ESBL E. coli. The patient was afebrile, and had no
suprapubic tenderness to suggest infection, though she did have
white cells, leuk+, and bacteria. She likely has chronic
inflammation in her bladder from the foley, and was not treated,
though she should be treated with nitrofurantoin if she becomes
symptomatic.
