CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pulmonary embolism found incidentally on a
routine staging CT.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66 year old male
who was most recently discharged from the hospital on [**2161-3-4**].  He
had been in his usual state of good health until approximately
mid-[**Month (only) 958**] when he began to notice dark colored urine, [**Doctor Last Name 352**]
colored stools and jaundice.  Subsequent workup including
abdominal CAT, liver biopsy as well as multiple ERCPs as well as
multiple interventional radiology interventions, concluded the
diagnosis of adenocarcinoma at the head of the pancreas with
liver metastasis as well as biliary obstruction.  During the past
hospital admission patient underwent interventional radiology
stenting for a biliary drain and had a routine staging chest CT
prior to discharge.  Review of the CT revealed a pulmonary
embolism in a proximal branch of the right pulmonary artery
extending to the right lower lobe.  The radiologist communicated
this to the discharge attending and patient was called back to
[**Hospital1 18**].  In the emergency department patient had a CT of the head
done which showed no intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass shift,
shift of midline structures or enhancing masses seen.  There
was no obvious intracranial hemorrhage or obvious metastasis.
Patient was then started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation
for the pulmonary embolism and admitted to the medicine service.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reports he has had dyspnea
for approximately two weeks which has not changed since his
past admission.  He particularly noticed that he is fatigued
while climbing stairs.  He denies chest pain, cough, fever,
hemoptysis.  He denies nausea, vomiting.  He denies diarrhea,
bright red blood per rectum or melena.  Stools are normal
color now.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Benign gastric cancer, status post
partial gastrectomy in [**2142**].  Status post right inguinal
hernia repair and left inguinal hernia repair.  Denies
coronary artery disease, hypertension or diabetes.  Right
Achilles tendon heel rupture, status post repair.  Right knee
surgery for a question of cartilage problems, status post
surgery.  Recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer with liver
metastasis, status post biliary stent placement and
intervention.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  Adverse reactions:
codeine causes nausea.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked one pack per day of
cigarettes times 40 years.  He quit approximately two weeks prior
to admission when diagnosed with cancer.  He is a social drinker
and drinks a few drinks every week.  He is married and lives on
[**Hospital3 **] with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] previously worked in auto repair, but
is now retired.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother died of pancreatic cancer 1.5 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission were
temperature 99, heart rate 107, blood pressure 149/74,
respiratory rate 28, O2 saturation 97% in room air.  HEENT
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Scleral icterus.  Extraocular
motions intact.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.
Neck was supple, there was no lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary
diminished breath sounds bilaterally and poor air movement,
but with good inspiratory effort.  Had bibasilar crackles.
Cardiac S1, S2, normal, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,
gallops or rubs, no elevated JVD.  Abdomen normoactive bowel
sounds, soft, nontender, had a biliary drain intact,
nontender.  There was no erythema, rebound, guarding.  There
was trace guaiac positive biliary fluid.  There was
tenderness in the right upper quadrant and left upper
quadrant.  On GU exam trace guaiac positive, but patient had
positive hemorrhoids.  Extremities no lower extremity edema.
Dorsalis pedis 2+ pulses bilaterally.  Neuro AAO times four.
Cranial nerves II-XII intact.  No focal weakness.  Good
muscle tone and strength.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 138, potassium 4.1, chloride 102,
bicarb 23, BUN 23, creatinine 0.8, glucose 150.  White blood
count 18.9, hematocrit 30.1, platelets 431.  INR 1.2, PTT
23.9.  CEA 547, CA19-9 226,937.  CT of the chest inferior
posterior margin of pericardium with a 7 to 8 mm nodular
density.  Small hiatal hernia.  Atelectasis.  A 4 mm
subpleural nodular density along the lateral aspect of the
left lower lobe.  There was no effusion.  There was a filling
defect of the proximal branch of the right pulmonary artery
extending to the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.  The
appearance of this was consistent with pulmonary emboli.  The
impression of the CT was that intraluminal filling defects
within the pulmonary artery branches to both the right middle
lobe and right lower lobe were consistent with pulmonary
emboli.  CT of the abdomen multiple low attenuation lesions
of the liver, low attenuation of the head of the pancreas.
CT of the head no intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage, no
metastasis.  EKG sinus rhythm, rate 90 beats per minute,
normal axis, no ST-T wave changes.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 66 year old white male with a history
of recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer who was called back
to [**Hospital1 18**] for pulmonary embolism which was found incidentally
on a routine staging CT.  As there is no contraindication for
anticoagulation (negative head CT, guaiac negative stools),
patient was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
Patient subsequently had a prolonged hospital course and the
hospital course will be dictated by date.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2161-3-6**] patient had a head CT, no metastasis
to the head, no intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage.  Patient
was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation and was then
subsequently changed to Lovenox. Patient as well as his wife
received teaching on Lovenox administration.  Oncology consult
(Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Driver) came and evaluated patient again
and felt that the best anticoagulation therapy would be Lovenox.
They felt that once his bilirubin normalized, treatment options
would include weekly intravenous therapy with gemcitabine or oral
therapy with capecitabine.  Due to his high bilirubin and the
potential interactions of Coumadin with capecitabine, the
oncology consult recommended dosing of enoxaparin (Lovenox)
instead of Coumadin as anticoagulation.  Patient wished to
receive treatment on [**Location (un) **] and Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **]/Driver referred
him to a local oncologist in [**Hospital1 1562**].

Additionally, interventional radiology saw the patient and took
him to the IR suite for evaluation of his stent.  This evaluation
revealed a patent common bile duct, however, a new diagnosis of
stenosis proximal to the common bile duct stent was seen.  IR
felt that patient needed additional biliary stenting at a later
point in time.  On [**2161-3-7**] biliary drainage turned bloody with
some clots in the drainage bag. There was a question of whether
this was secondary to tumor bleeding, possible liver bleeding
with anticoagulation or possible tube track-communication to the
portal branch of one of the vessels.  Approximately 20 cc of
bloody clot was found in the bag, but patient was hemodynamically
stable.  Interventional radiology was notified and evaluated
patient.

On [**2161-3-8**] the patient began to have abdominal pain, particularly
lower back pain.  There were small amounts of bloody drainage in
his biliary bag.  Patient began to complain of nausea and
positive vomiting.  Abdomen was soft, nontender with no rebound
initially.  It appeared that there was no output from the stent
and that the biliary drainage catheter was obstructed.  Secondary
to the concern for retroperitoneal bleed/tumor bleeding/any
further bleeding, CT of the abdomen was done stat to evaluate
patient's abdomen. The results of the CT abdomen showed again
liver with numerous hypodense lesions consistent with metastasis,
but there were no signs of intrahepatic ductal dilatation, no
evidence of hemorrhage of the liver lesions and no e
