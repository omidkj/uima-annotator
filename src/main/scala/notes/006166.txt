History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75 yo male w/ HTN, CAD s/p MI 4 weeks earlier, dementia
w/ poor po's, chills, increased fatigue over last several days.
On evening of admit, developed acute abdominal pain then
followed by acute resp distress. In field, found w/ narrow

Pertinent Results:
CXR - Findings consistent with CHF, although underlying
bilateral lower lobe pneumonias cannot be excluded. Follow up.
.
[**4-12**] ECG -  Regular tachycardia - may be sinus tachycardia but
consider also atrial tachycardia. Left ventricular hypertrophy
by voltage. Poor R wave progression could be due in part to left
ventricular hypertrophy, but consider also anteroseptal
myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Clinical correlation
is suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison
.
[**4-14**] ECG - Baseline artifact. Narrow complex tachycardia may be
atrial flutter or fibrillation, but baseline artifact makes
assessment difficult. Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage.
Poor R wave progression could be due in part to left ventricular
hypertrophy, but consider also anteroseptal myocardial
infarction of indeterminate age. Anterolateral ST-T wave
abnormalities. Cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2167-4-13**] sinus rhythm is
now absent.
.
[**4-13**] TTE - mild LVH. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
There is mild global  left ventricular hypokinesis (lateral
basal segments contract best). Overall  left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately  dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets  are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
CHF - the patient was found to be fluid overloaded on CXR.  This
was attributed to his tachycardia and hypertension.  He was give
IV lasix in the ED.  The patient was rate controlled with a beta
blocker.  Once his electrolytes stabilized he was started on an
ACE inhibitor.  TTE was obtained and showed global hypokinesis
with an EF of 40-45%.  Outside hospital records were obtained
and the patient's EF was found to be at baseline.  Cardiac
enzymes were cycled x3.  The patient's troponin was elevated in
the setting of his renal failure, however; his CK's were found
to be negative.  Once his tachycardia and BP were controlled the
patient was weaned from a NRB to a nasal cannula.  He was
eventually d/c on room air.
.
Pneumonia - The patient presented with a fever to 101.6, wbc of
17.2, and questionable b/l pneumonia on cxr.  He was initially
started on levaquin, ceftazadime, and vancomycin.  Upon transfer
to the floor the patient was maintained on levaquin which was
dosed every other day in light of his renal failure.  He was d/c
to home with treatment for a total of 14 days.
.
Tachycardia - cardiology consult was called to address the
patient's SVT.  Based on their initial assessment, they felt his
rhythm may have been in atrial flutter that eventually
transitioned to atrial tachycardia vs. sinus tachycardia.  They
recommended rate control with an IV beta blocker to keep the
patient HR < 100.  It was felt that his ECG changes represented
his recent completed anteroeptal MI and cardaic catheterization
was deferred.  Upon transfer to the floor the patient had
several episodes where he was tachycardic to the 120's.  He was
treated with IV beta blocker.  It appeared by ECG and telemetry
that the patient was in atrial fibrillation though it was not
completely clear.  His heart rate eventually responded to
titration of his oral beta blocker.  He was eventually d/c to
home with 300 mg of Toprol XL every day.

Shortness of Breath: the patient's shortness of was attributed
to 1) fluid overload from tachycardia and hypertension 2)
possible pneumonia based on fever, leukocytosis, and
questionable opacities on CXR.  The patient was Pt white count
and O2 sat stable
- cont levofloxacin q 48 in light of pt renal function
- continue nebs
- prn lasix for fluid overload
.
ESRD - The patient was seen by the renal service and underwent
dialysis on two occassions.
.
Dementia - the patient was often agitated on the floor.  He
required a 1:1 sitter and occasional haldol for sedation.  Per
his wife the patient had done poorly in the hospital in the
past.  She felt his behavior was not out of the ordinary.  His
MS slightly improved with treatment of infection though he was
never completely lucid.  Per conversation with the patient's
wife and PCP the patient functions much better in his home
environment.  Per the wishes of his wife he was d/c's to home
with VNA.
