HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year-old
male admitted earlier then anticipated, because of failure to
thrive, respiratory difficulties, peripheral edema and
pericardial effusion after having been discharged for a prior
hospitalization for aspiration pneumonia where he was found
to have a collapse of his left main stem bronchus, distal
trachea and right main stem bronchus for which he
subsequently had a stent placed during that previous visit.
He returned on [**4-23**] of [**2195**] earlier then anticipated as
mentioned previously for removal of these stents and
tracheoplasty and pericardiotomy for intraoperative
pericardiotomy for pericardial effusion that he developed.

At the time of his admission the patient was afebrile with
blood pressure 150/80, pulse 70, respiratory rate 20 and he
was sating 95% on room air.  Notably on examination his
cardiac examination revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm.
The lungs revealed bilateral crackles throughout and there
was 1 to 2+ pitting edema most markedly notable in the lower
extremities.

On admission his electrolytes were all within normal limits
with a BUN and creatinine of 18 and 1.0.  His white blood
cell count was 4.4.  Hematocrit 37.5 and platelet count was
131.  PT was 13.7, INR 1.2 and PTT was 59.4.

The patient was admitted and had his stents removed on [**4-28**]. He subsequently underwent a number of bronchoscopies for
clearing of secretions.  He was optimized preoperatively for
surgery.  On [**4-30**] he underwent right thoracotomy with
posterior membrane tracheoplasty and bilateral
bronchoplasties along with pericardial window.  The surgery
went smoothly without complications, but due to the patient's
size and anatomy the distal portion of the left main stem
bronchus could not be corrected, therefore some
tracheomalacia remained at that edge.  Initially
postoperatively, the patient's course went fairly smoothly.
Several days postoperatively the patient developed acute
renal failure for which his creatinine jumped to 3.5 and this
was found to be partially due to acute tubular necrosis and
hypovolemia.  The patient remained in and out of atrial
fibrillation throughout the course of his hospitalization.
One week postoperatively the patient went into pulmonary
congestion and subsequent respiratory arrest at which time he
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, but was
subsequently extubated with aggressive diuresis and
aggressive antimicrobial therapy.  The patient was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit after his tracheal
bronchitis had cleared and he subsequently went back to the
floor.  While on the floor the patient developed severe
pneumonia, which required him to return to the Intensive Care
Unit.  Again with aggressive care and antimicrobial therapy
he regained enough strength to return to the floor.

After discharge to the floor toward the end of his
hospitalization he did well for two weeks.  He did have
repeat bronchoscopies, which showed the distal tracheal
malacia as previously mentioned, but there was excellent
clearance of secretions throughout.  It is anticipated that
as his airway edema resolves his clearance will become even
more improved.  Of note, late in his hospital course the
patient developed recurrent right pleural effusions with some
loculations, but the majority of this was cleared with
placement of a chest tube.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  On discharge the patient was doing
well without shortness of breath and he comfortably cleared
secretions without assistance and has an excellent cough.
The deconditioning from the hospitalization needs aggressive
rehabilitation and he does need to anticoagulation for his
atrial fibrillation.  While in the hospital he was on
Lovenox, but he needs to be converted to Coumadin while in
rehab.  He needs to follow up with his cardiologist for
further management of this atrial fibrillation.  He should be
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] within two weeks.
