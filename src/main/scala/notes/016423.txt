Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
67 M w CAD, severe COPD (FEV1 31% FEV1/FVC 78), CHF (LVEF 55%)
presents with dyspnea x 2 wks which has acutely worsened since
this morning. Pt reports chronic dyspnea & cough productive of
clear sputum. For the past 2 weeks, he has felt increased SOB &
is unable to identify aggravating/allieviating factors. He tried
taking albuterol nebulizers at home without improvment. This
morning he awoke with worse dyspnea, he checked his O2 sat and
found SaO2 72% and called EMS. Enroute he was given nebs with
improvment in symptoms. He had previously been in 4-6L O2 but
since quitting, he reports O2 sats of 92% in the AM which
improve to as high as 96% with ambulation.
.
At baseline pt has cough productive of clear sputum.  There have
been no changes in its color or quantity.  His home nebulizers
have not improved his symptoms. Denies fevers, but endorses
chills, no leg swelling, orthopnea, PND, CP.  This AM, pt
checked his sat & found it was 72% on RA so he decided to call
ED.
.
On arrival to ED, oxygen 70% on RA
.
The pt was given albuterol/atrovent nebs with sats improved to
98% on the neb then 88% on 3L NC.  Peak flow 160.
.
In the ED, the patient was given methylpred 125 mg IV for likely
COPD exacerbation. Initial CXR showed evidence of new RLL
consolidation.  He was also started on azithro, cftx, levoflox,
& flagyl to cover for CAP & possible aspiration PNA.  He was
also given 500 cc IVNS.  He was noted to be tremulous and given
0.5 mg IV lorazepam for concern of EtOH w/d.
.
Pt's ABG on 10L revealed PCO2 of 57 (7.37/57/149).  He was
placed on BiPAP which transiently decreased his PO2; FiO2 was
subsequently increased (7.39/57/72 on BiPAP with 33% FiO2,
appears comfortable, increased fio2 to 40%
.
EKG showed sinus rhythm without STE/STD.
.
Prior to transfer: Afebrile 137/79  72  BiPAP 5/5 with FiO2 40
.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood culture [**2108-5-20**]: pending

IMAGING:
CXR [**2108-5-20**]: No definite acute cardiopulmonary process

[**2108-5-23**] ECHO: Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with low
normal systolic function. Mild global right ventricular systolic
function. Elevated left sided filling pressures. Pulmonary
pressures could not be determined.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 M hx/o severe COPD recently off home oxygen, dCHF, CAD s/p
stents presents with worsening dyspnea x 2 weeks.
.
# Dyspnea & Hypoxia: THe patient was treated for a COPD
exacerbation.  There was no evidence of acute infection.  He was
initially given Solumedrol and was transitioned to prednisone
which should be tapered.  He was given azithromycin as well
which he should take for 5 days. He was given ipratropium and
albuterol nebs with improvement.  He will restart his outpatient
regiment including Advair and Spiriva at discharge.  He was
evaluated by PT who recommended rehab.  His goal O2 sats are
90-93%
.
# Hypercarbia: Pt's ABG consistent with compensated metabolic
acidosis. He chronically retains CO2.  Review of pulm notes
reveal that his stauration should be maintained around 90-92%.
.
# EtOH Abuse/Withdrawal: He was monitored for EtOh withdrawl
with a CIWA scale but did not show signs of withdrawl.
.
# dCHF, CAD: He did not appear volume overloaded.  ECHO was done
to eval for possible changes to suggest pulmonary hypertension
or other etiology.  There was no dramatic change but pulmonary
pressures were not able to be recorded.  He was continued on his
aspirin, betablocker, and statin.  He should follow up with his
PCP to discuss monitoring of his ejection fraction given that it
is low normal now and he may benefit from an ACEI in the future.
BNP was not elevated during this hospitalization.
.
# Cystinuria: Continued on penicillamine.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: Continued on fluoxetine and Valium.
.
# HLD: Continue simvastatin
.
# B12 Deficiency: Checked vitamin B12 level in setting of
macrocytosis.  Levels were slightly low. Folate was normal.  Pt
should follow up with PCP to discuss rechecking levels with MMA
and homocysteine and replacement as needed.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Patient's code status was full code this admission.
-Consider outpatient sleep study to assess for sleep apnea.
-follow up with PCP regarding possible Vitamin B12 deficiency
and progressive CHF.
