bleeding.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 74762**] presented [**5-15**] with 1 wk h/o LLQ pain and was found
by CT scan to have sigmoid diverticulitis with associated
perforation. She was managed conservatively without operation,
with a combination of bowel rest and antibiotics (Zosyn ->
augmentin). Course also notable for diarrhea, and although 3 C
dif toxin assays were negative, flagyl was added empirically for
presumed c dif colitis. Patient was also noted to have labile
blood sugars.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 74762**] was found by her grandson this afternoon to be
somnolent and difficult to arrouse, diaphoretic,and called EMS.

been eating much since the recent discharge, stating that she
had a poor appetite. She states that she has not had a similar
episode of hypoglycemia for approximately two years.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 74762**] also reports an episode of rectal bleeding this am,
with blood on the bowel movement and turning the toilet water
red. She denies having BRBPR prior to this episode, and did not
notice bleeding with a subsequent bowel movement. SHe has
continued to have loose bowel movements since recent discharge,
with approx [**1-15**] bm/day. No fevers, no NS. No abdominal pain.

Pertinent Results:
Abd CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant interval change in sigmoid diverticulitis with
associated contained perforation. No drainable collection is
identified.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
3. No short change in cystic right adnexal lesion, as discussed
on the recent CT.
4. Trace amount of air within the bladder, which could be
consistent with prior instrumentation. Clinical correlation
recommended.
5. New small right pleural effusion.
-----
CXR [**5-23**]:IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
-----
CXR [**5-25**]:IMPRESSION: Small left effusion without evidence of
overt CHF.
-----
CXR [**5-28**]:IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of congestive heart
failure or pneumonia.
-----
Echo:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
probably normal
though the views are limited and the study technically
difficult. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is probably normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Though
difficult to assess
given the limited views, probably moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation present.
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
-----
CXR PA/Lat:
Subsegmental atelectasis.
Incidental anterior compression fracture of thoracic vertebral
body, as seen on the preoperative film.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. GI bleed: In the ED, she had guaiac + stool and Hct=26.4(down
from 29.8 on D/C several days earlier).  Went to floor for a
short time, but there was noted to have BRBPR and passed
multiple clots.  Her BP also dropped from systolic of 130s to
100s.  She wasn't symptomatic from this BP.  She was transferred
to the ICU and given IVfs which brought her BP up quickly.  She
was also given 3 units PRBCs.  In ICU, she had no bloody BMs,
and her Hct was stable since transfusions.  Surgery also saw her
in the ED and believed that surgery not indicated at this time.
Her ASA/Plavix was held during admission given bleed, but
restarted on discharge.  She did have traces of blood in her
stools several more times during admission, but her Hct remained
stable.  She had nL BMs for 3-4 days before D/C without blood.
Believe bleed was secondary to her diverticulae.  Does not
appear to be result of her known perforation.  Her diet was
advanced slowly and she did well, without nausea/vomiting or abd
pain.  Discussed with GI, and no possibility of colonoscopy for
at least 6 weeks after her perforation.  She will see her PCP as
[**Name9 (PRE) 3782**] and can have GI colonoscopy set up for 6-8 weeks from now.

.
2. Diverticulitis - She was started on Augmentin and Flagyl with
plans to finish 7 day course on last D/C.  On readmission, she
was switched to flagyl and Unasyn given known perf and
possibility of diverticulitis.  She also had bandemia, but nL
WBC ct. Cxs and CXR were neg, and no other obvious [**Last Name (un) 68421**] of
infection. Abd was benign throughout.   She was febrile for much
of her stay here (low grade), but this had resolved by
discharge.  We stopped her Flagyl several days before D/C, and
sent her out on Augmentin(had switched from Unasyn when she came
to floor) to finish 14 day course of abx.
.
3. Wheezing - She began to have wheezing on [**Last Name (un) **] and has
