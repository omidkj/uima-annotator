STUDIES:
CXR: Diffuse left lung opacities which are nonspecific, and
differential considerations include infection, infarction, or
hemorrhage.
CT head: no acute intracranial process.
CT C-spine: no fracture or traumatic malalignment. Degenerative
changes are noted with mild ventral thecal sac effacement at
C4/5. If concern exists for intrathecal abnormalities, these
would be best evaluated with MRI.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: L renal cyst, large ventral hernia with
dilated loops proximally unchanged from previou

Brief Hospital Course:
76yoM with a history of CHF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin
found down by neighbor at home who presented with pneumonia and
sepsis to the medical ICU.  He had a recent history of declining
aggressive care for a hernia, but gave verbal consent to
intubation in the emergency department.

On arrival he had a left-shifted leukocytosis and hypotension
thought to be due to pneumonia given the large inflitrate seen
on CXR. His urine did not have evidence of infection. He had a
recent history of incarcerated hernia without repair, but his CT
did not have evidence of abscess or perforation. He was started
on vancomycin, Zosyn and Flagyl on arrival and required Levophed
to maintain his blood pressures.  Over the next 24 hours his
clinical situation deteriorated significantly.  He had cool
mottled extremities and required significant pressor support to
maintain blood pressures.  He had an elevated troponin and acute
on chronic renal failure.  He was seen by surgery because of his
ventral and inguinal hernias.  Neither appeared incarcerated and
the patient had recently expressed his desire not to be operated
upon.

The patient required increasing pressor support through hospital
day#2 and his health care proxy (HCP) [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 59353**] expressed
a desire to not escalate care.  Pressors and mechanical
ventilation were maintained while the HCP [**Name (NI) 653**] family
members.  WIth the family members it was decided to withdraw
care.  The patient was extubated and his pain controlled with
fentanyl.  He passed away peacefully.
