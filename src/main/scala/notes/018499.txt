[**2122-9-22**] Head CT : 1. Small right frontoparietal subdural
hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage with foci of subarachnoid
bleed in the left parietal and left occipital suggesting
contrecoup injury. No significant change since the prior study
done at outside hospital.
  2. No fractures identified.

[**2122-9-22**] C Spine CT : 1. No acute C-spine fractures or abnormal
alignment detected. Please note that MRI is more sensitive for
ligamentous /cord injury.
2. Mild degenerative changes of the C-spine, without significant
spinal canal stenosis.
3. Bilateral apical lung opacities. Correlate with dedicated
chest imaging, either x-ray or CT.

[**2122-9-22**] Chest/Abd ST : 1. Consolidation in the dependent portion
of the lungs bilaterally, possibly due aspiration, atelectasis
or infection. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
  2. No evidence of traumatic injury to the remainder of the
torso.
  3. Moderate diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
  4. Over-distention of the endotracheal tube balloon.
  5. 6 mm enhancing lesion within the periphery of the left lobe
of the liver is non-specific and may represent a flash-filling
hemangioma, adenoma, or area of FNH.

[**2122-9-23**] Cardiac echo : The left atrium is dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the distal 40
percent of the left ventricle. Estimated left ventricular
ejection fraction is 30 percent. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 3 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

[**2122-9-24**] Cardiac Echo :
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of mid left ventricular
walls and akineisis of apical walls and apex. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. Estimated
ejection fraction is 25-30%. There is evidence of diastolic
dysfunction. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2122-9-23**], there is worsening of the of pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension, which is now moderate.
IMPRESSION: Severly depressed left ventricular systolic
function, evidence of diastolic dysfunction with elevated PAWP
(> 18 mmHg). Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation, moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2122-9-27**] CXR : There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
mildly decreased on the right since prior study. Clips are
present in the right axilla. Heart and mediastinum are within
normal limits. Lungs are otherwise grossly clear.

Carotid duplex [**9-29**]: no stenosis


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred  to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
management of her SDH.  During her stay in the ER she
desaturated to the mid 80's and was urgently intubated.  A
repeat Head CT was done which showed no change and she was
subsequently transferred to the Trauma ICU.  Her vital signs
were stable and her neurologic status was evaluated off
sedation.  She was able to move all four extremities and
responded appropriately to commands.  She was extubated 24 hours
later successfully and again her neuro exam was unchanged.  She
was then transferred to the Trauma floor for further management

Unfortunately on [**2122-9-24**] she desaturated again and was
transferred back to the ICU. She was in CHF and required
vigorous diuresis and BIPAP.  A cardiac echo was done which
revealed diastolic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and an
EF of 25%.  She subsequently developed atrial fibrillation and
was placed on a diltiazem drip.  She eventually converted to NSR
and the cardiology service was consulted. Their recommendations
included further diuresis then [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, beta blockers for afib
with discontinuation of diltiazem and starting an ACEI.  A
follow up echo is recommended in [**5-25**] weeks with her cardiologist
and if her diastolic dysfunction improves then her ACEI may be
able to be stopped.  Their thought is that she may have
Takotsubo's stress cardiomyopathy which may resolve in time.
Carotid studies were normal.

She was transferred back to the Trauma floor and was seen on
multiple occasions by PT and OT.  She was slowly making progress
with ambulation.  Her neurologic exam was unchanged and she will
