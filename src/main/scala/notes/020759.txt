Pertinent Results:
OSH Imaging:
CT abd/pelvis [**11-24**]: Prominent CBD (11 mm) and pancreatic duct
(7 mm) with probable 7 mm distal CBD stone at level of
pancreatic head. Given dilation of both the CBD and panc. duct,
consideration should be given to distal obstruction (stone,
stenosis/stricture, pancreatic
head mass). Aorta is heavily calcified. No evidence of free air,
SBO or pneumotosis. No intra-abdominal abscess of fluid
collection. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Gallstones as seen on US.
.
CXR [**11-24**]: There is no acute cardiopulmonary process. The lungs
are clear and pleural surfaces are smooth with no effusion or
pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
.
RUQ U/S [**11-24**]:
1. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. Son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**]
sign was not able to be elicited, though the patient just
received pain medication.
2. Prominent common bile duct, however, it can be traced in
nearly its entirety with no evidence of CBD stones.

Imaging:
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2189-11-24**]
1. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. Son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**]
sign was not able to be elicited, though the patient had just
received pain medication.
2. Dilated common bile duct and pancreatic duct; however, the
CBD can be traced quite distally to the region of the pancreatic
head, with no evidence of CBD calculus.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-11-25**]
1. Dilatation of the CBD and pancreatic duct, raising the
possibility of distal obstruction at the ampullary level due to
stone, stricture/stenosis, ampullary or pancreatic head mass.
Evaluation for mass is significantly limited due to lack of IV
contrast. There is a 7 mm hypoattenuating structure within the
distal CBD, proximal to the ampulla, which is likely a stone.
Given the patient's clinical scenario of RUQ pain, marked
leukocytosis and sepsis, cholangitis is a consideration and ERCP
should be considered.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Extensive vascular calcification throughout the aorta. No
evidence of free air, pneumatosis, or bowel pathology.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Though there is an apparent
calculus in the distalmost CBD, as mentioned above, the duct
does not appear to taper to it and, in fact, remains dilated to
the ampullary level. There is also a suggestion of abnormal
rounded soft tissue in the region of the ampulla (2:38;
301b:29), protruding into the 2nd portion of the duodenum. While
this could represent edema surrounding an impacted calculus
(given the other calculi), an ampullary carcinoma is a distinct
consideration and an additional reason for ERCP with
brushings/biopsy, if feasible.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2189-12-1**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Pathology Reports:
AMPULLARY BIOPSY [**2189-11-25**]
DIAGNOSIS: Ampullary body biopsy: Fragments of adenoma with
low-grade dysplasia.
AMPULLARY BIOPSY [**2189-12-16**]
DIAGNOSIS: Ampulla (major papilla), biopsy:
1.  Fragments of adenoma.
2.  Adjacent duodenal mucosa with chronic active enteritis and
focal ulceration.
3.  Multiple levels are examined.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Septic [**Name (NI) 21020**]
Pt was found to have an ampullary mass and stricture leading to
cholangitis thought due to clostridium perfringens. He initially
required 2 pressors and his extremities were cyanotic. He was
initially treated with meropenem, penicillin, cipro, vancomycin,
metronidazole and clindamycin. Once his blood grew out gram
negative and gram positive rods, the antibiotics were tappered
to meropenem, cipro and vanc with renal dosing.  He was started
on empiric treatment with hydrocortisone for 5 days. His
pressors were weaned in the first 2-3 days and he seemed to be
improving.  He subsequently was treated for a 14d course of
cipro and meropenem to treat c. perfringens and GNR per d/w ID.
He intermittently had hypotensive episodes and intermittent
fevers requiring volume resuscitation in the MICU.  We also
intermittently treated with vanco although this was not
supported by cx data.  Repeat cxs were NGTD. Ultimately, given
that he was afebrile and there were no positive culture data,
all antibiotics were stopped.  On the floor his blood pressure
was noted to be increased and he was started on Metoprolol and
Amlodipine for control.

# Respiratory Failure
Pt was intubated in setting of severe sepsis. He had no known
previous lung disease. Pt was slow to wake up given sedation on
board in setting of ren
