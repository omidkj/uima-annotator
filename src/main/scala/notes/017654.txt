Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per ostomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 61 year old male with past medical history
significant for rectal cancer s/p LAR with end colostomy
([**2174**])and XRT, CAD s/p CABG ([**2172**]), CHF (EF=25%) s/p placement
of PPM, HTN and DM who presents to ED with complaints of bloody
output from ostomy accompanied by dizziness. Patient reports the
first episode occurred about 10:00 this a.m. This was then
followed by an additional output around 10:30a.m. The patient
described the output as dark red and "jelly" like. In the
setting of this bloody output, the patient reports that he feels
tired and lightheaded. He denies however any associated chest
pain or shortness or breath. The patient reports that he takes
aspirin daily, which he has been doing for 10+ years, but
otherwise has not added any additional NSAIDs or anti-platelet
drugs to his daily regimen.
.
The patient reports that he has been eating and drinking well at
home without any associated nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain
currently. However, the patient does reports dull abomdinal pain
for 1-2 days preceeding the current episode.
.
In the ED, the patient was evaluated and a gastric lavage was
negative for acute bleeding. The patient was additionally seen
and evaluated by surgery. Since his presentation to the ED to
his evaluation by surgery, the patient had decreased bloody
output and more normal appearing stool. The decision was made at
that time to admit the patient to medicine, assess the patient
again in the morning, and make possible plans for colonoscopy.
In the evening, around 8:00 pm, the patient again began to have
bloody output, with 425cc documented in the ED nursing chart. 50
minutes later there was an additional 225cc of maroon, partially
clotted bloody output. The patient reported that he still felt
lightheaded, but denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.
The patient was non-orthostatic at this time with a lying BP of
105/27 and HR of 62; sitting BP of 111/41 with a HR of 64; and a
standing BP of 114/23 with a HR of 65. Pt will be admitted to
medicine for further care.

Pertinent Results:
[**2185-6-13**] CXR - No evidence of congestive heart failure
[**2185-6-15**] ECHO - The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are  normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe hypokinesis of the
inferior and lateral walls including the apex. The anterior wall
is not weel seen. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle.  There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2185-6-20**] LE Doppler (R) - No deep venous thrombosis within the
right common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, or
popliteal veins
[**2185-6-21**] GI Bleeding Study - No evidence of active bleeding.
[**2185-6-21**] UGI SGL W/ SBFT - No reason for bleeding identified in
this study.
[**2185-6-27**] GI Bledding Study - No evidence of active bleeding
[**2185-6-28**] CXR - Interval development of congestive heart failure
with perihilar and basilar edema and new small right pleural
effusion.
[**2185-7-3**] CXR - The patient is status post sternotomy with
mediastinal clips. There is mild cardiomegaly. A left-sided dual
lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium and
right ventricle. A third lead may also be present, not well
visualized here. There is minimal upper zone redistribution, but
no overt CHF. There is a small-to-moderate right effusion with
underlying collapse and/or consolidation. The left costophrenic
sulcus is clear. Aside from the right base, no focal infiltrate
is identified. There is mild diffuse parenchymal scarring.
Compared with [**2185-6-13**], the right pleural effusion is new.
Compared with [**2185-6-28**], there has been improvement in the CHF
findings and the left base has cleared.
[**2185-7-4**] CXR - There has been interval right thoracentesis with
near complete resolution of a previously noted right pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax is identified, and there is otherwise
no significant change since the recent chest radiograph of 1 day
earlier.
