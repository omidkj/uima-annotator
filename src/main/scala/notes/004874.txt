=============
IMAGINGS:

CT ABD/PELVIS with contrast ([**8-24**]) final:
1. Large left rectus sheath hematoma measuring up to 16 x 10 x
6.1 cm, with possible focus of active extravasation in the lower
portion. A follow up contrast-enhanced study (CT or MR) should
be performed to ensure no underlying mass lesion is present in
[**5-17**] weeks time.
2. Colonic diverticulosis with evidence for diverticulitis.
3. Small sliding hiatal hernia.
.
CXR ([**8-24**]) final: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
.
CXR ([**8-27**]) final: New mild pulmonary edema. Stable position of
the pacemaker leads and new right central venous line with its
tip in the upper SVC.

=============
EKG ([**8-25**]): a-paced, nml axis, prolonged QT interval (460,
likely in setting of sotalol), no STT changes concerning for
ischemia.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 81 yo F on coumadin for AFIB presenting with a rectus
sheath hematoma in the setting of a slightly supratherapeutic
INR and vigourous coughing.
.
# Rectus Sheath Hematoma: INR elevated at 4.3 which is the
highest INR she has recoreded in our system (followed as outpt
for coumadin mgt). No predisposing trauma; it is conceivable
that severe cough could have caused this. In the early morning
on HD2, pt triggered for hypotension SBP in the 80s, stat Hct
was found to be 23 and was transferred to MICU after minimal SBP
response to fluids and 2u pRBC. In the mean time, pt's abdominal
ecchymosis was expanding to the right side. Patient was then
taken to IR for inferior epigastric artery embolization. Patient
was transferred back to the floor the next day. Since the
embolization, patient's BP has been in the 90-140 range since.
Hct has been stable at 26-30. Pt received bicarb and mucomyst
for prophylaxis of contrast induced nephropathy.
.
# Cough. Patient has been having a minimally productive cough
following a viral illness. The most likely etiology is
bronchitis. CXR showed no infectious process, so antibiotics was
discontinued. Patient received one dose of levofloxacin. She
also received albuterol nebulizers, robittusin, and benzonatate
for cough. Patient was afebrile during the hospitalization.
.
# A-fib: Sotalol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] was continued except for when patient
was hypotensive. Coumadin was held, and patient needs to discuss
with PCP regarding the risks/benefits of anticoagulation.
.
# HTN: Home antihypertensives dyazide 37.5/25mg daily and cozaar
(50mg qAM / 25mg qPM) were held during the hospitalization.
Patient was told to continue to hold the anti-hypertensives
until follow up with her PCP.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Home simvastatin 40 mg daily was continued.
.
# Dementia: Aricept was continued.

Patient received IVFs, a total of 4u pRBC during this
hospitalization. She had regular diet, and was tolerating POs.
Patient had 2 large bore PIV and CVL for access. She used
pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis. She had full code. Family
(husband and daughter) were updated regularly.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to be involved in your care, Mrs. [**Known lastname 6330**]. You
were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of
bleeding into your abdominal wall in the setting of vigorous
coughing and blood being too thin on coumadin. Your INR on
admission was 4.3 (your therapeutic INR range should [**3-16**]). We
held your coumadin. Your bleeding was stopped by our
interventional radiologiest by embolization (coiling the
bleeding vessel). Your blood pressure, and blood counts have
been stable since the procedure. It will take o
