Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pulmonary artery catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
81 yo M with CAD s/p MI x3 (last '[**76**]) and PTCA w/stent x2 to RCA
and LCx(@ [**Hospital1 112**], [**11-5**]), systolic heart failure EF ~20% (by cath
report; 35% by echo [**10-5**]) and IDDM, p/w SOB. Pt reports that he
has been having periodic episodes of dyspnea since [**August 2185**], requiring x3 prior admits to [**Hospital1 112**]. He underwent cardiac cath
last month, as he was not a good candidate for CABG, but notes
no improvement in sxs since the procedure. He was last admitted
to [**Hospital1 112**] [**Date range (1) 55744**], where he was treated for hyperkalemia in the
setting of ARF with K 5.4 and Cr 4.1 (baseline 1.9-2.0). He also
c/o SOB at that time, but CXR showed no evidence of failure and
he was d/c'ed home after his potassium had come down. This
morning, he called EMS after waking up multiple times over night
feeling as though he "was suffocating."  Pt states that this has
been going on for several weeks but happens more each night over
the past week.  In the field, EMS found him to be hypotensive
w/BP in 80s and hypoxic with O2sats 84%. He was bolused 500cc
and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management. Pt has stable 3
pillow orthopnea, occ PND, can walk several blocks with minor
difficulty, but cannot climb a flight of stairs without getting
SOB. He awakens 3-4x per night to urinate. He denies any recent
LE swelling, any non-compliance with med regimen, and any change
in dietary habits (follows low Na diet). He does not use O2 at
home.

In the ED, he received ASA, SLNTGx1 (which relieved his chest
tightness), lasix 40mg IVx2 and 0.5 in NTP. He was hypoxic with
O2 sats 84%2L, which increased to 87% on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was placed
on BiPAP. He responded to the decreased preload/afterload in
addition to diuresis, and O2 sats increased to 100% on 4L. He
was transferred to the floor for further management.

Past Medical History:
-CAD as above. Cath at [**Hospital1 112**] [**2185-11-9**] showed 95% d2 ostial, 70% Cx,
and diffuse RCA dz. Cypher DES x2 were placed (RCA and Cx);
estimated EF 20%; prior echo ?[**10-5**] showed EF 35%.
-ischemic CM, as above
-chronic renal insufficiency
-GERD

Social History:
Pt is originally from [**Country 3594**]. He is a retired diesel
mechanical engineer. One of his daughters lives in [**Name (NI) 669**]. He
lives alone in JP and has a homemaker come in x3/wk and VNA
services at home.  His daughter [**Name (NI) **] lives in [**Name (NI) 108**] and helps
him to make most medical decisions - she is a LPN.

PULMONARY ARTERY CATHETER PLACEMENT:
COMMENTS:     1.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevted
left
and right-heart pressures (RA mean 20mmHg, PA mean 36mmHg, PCWP
mean 21
mmHg).  The estimated cardiac output was 1.9 l/min.  Dobutamine
10
mcg/kg/min was started in the catheterization laboratory with
systolic
augmentation of the aortic pressure.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Cardiogenic shock.
2.  Severely elevated left and right heart filling pressures.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo M with DM2, CRI, CAD s/p MIx3, ischemic CM, EF ~20%, with
x5 months SOB not relieved by cath/PTCA, whose primary complaint
is waking up extremely short of breath multiple times at night
for the past few days.

1) Heart Failure: Pt's hypotension (most-likely explaining his
acute weakness and LH this am) and hypoxia on presentation [**1-4**]
decompensated failure as evidenced by CXR and exam. Per [**Hospital1 112**] cath
report, EF 20%. Acute myocardial infarction was ruled out by EKG
and negative enzymes. He was found to have a urinary tract
infection which could possibly be the cause of the acute
decompensation of his heart failure. He reports compliance to
meds and diet. However, he states that his primary doctor has
told him that his regimen has not been adequate and may need to
be changed. His carvedilol and Captopril were discontinued
during hospitalization in the setting of hypotension and acute
renal failure during hospitalization.  During this
hospitalization he was first diuresed and improved
symptomatically briefly but then began to decompensate with
development of acute pre-renal failure, hypotension, and
multiple episodes of awakening at night acutely short of breath.
During this time he continued to deteriorate and further
diuresis was attempted with natrecor without response.  He was
transferred to the CCU for further management.  While in the CCU
he was monitored closely and it was found that he was having up
to 5 episodes of [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing perhour, often times
with ventricular ectopy and on few occasions with desaturation,.
Apneic episodes lasted up to 60 seconds.  During this time he
also had acutely worsening renal failure, elevation of liver
enzymes, and demonstrated change in mental status.  A pulmonary
artery catheter was place with elevated PCWP and elevated right
sided pressures and a mixed venous 02 saturation of 24%.  He was
started on Dobutamine and within 24 hours his mental status
improved, and the [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing episodes decreased in
frequency as the cardiac index increased.  Within two days the
renal funtion began to improve and the liver enzymes began
trending down.  After several days on Dobutamine he was started
on digoxin qd, level was 1.7 and so regimen was decreased to
every other day.  It was felt that an inotrope was required and
though pt had CRI digoxin would be the most beneficial
medication to him at this time though it would have to be
monitored closely.  A follow-up appointment was made with his
primary cardiologist for two days from discharge for monitoring.
Beta blocker was held as it was felt that it would not be
beneficial to him in the current declined state of cardiac
function. He was monitored for three days off the docutamine
before discharge.
.
2) Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia: Episodes occurred in
setting of apnea and also while on Dobutamine.  In a family
meeting it was decided that Dobutamine would be continued
despite the increased ectopy.  EP was consulted and found that
the pt was no currently a ICD candidate.
.
3) DM2: Glyburide and Lantus discontinued during episode of ARF
but restarted on return to baseline creatinine.
.
4) Acute Renal Failure on CRI: Per [**Hospital1 112**] records, baseline Cr
around 2.0. Currently 1.5. During worsening heart failure prior
to CCU and Dobutamine initiation acute renal failure developed
likely secondary to poor perfusion.  During this time BUN was
elevated to over 100. Function returned to baseline as cardiac
index improved.
.
5) [**Name (NI) 12007**] pt was treated for complicated UTI with a course of
Bactrim.
.
6) Code: DNR/DNI. Discussed with pt and family extensively.
