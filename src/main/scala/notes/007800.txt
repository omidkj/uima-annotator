Chief Complaint:
nonhealing left great toe ulcer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PTA/stents to RCIA and LCIA.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman who was admitted for placement of
bilateral common iliac artery stents for peripheral vascular
disease for nonhealing toe ulcer on [**2-18**] and thrombin injection
for left common femoral pseudoaneurysm. She was s/p op day 2 and
was to be discharged when she developed the sudden onset of
shortness of breath. Her BP was 190/90 and O2 sat 68% on 4 L NC
she went up to 72%. An arterial blood gas obtained showed
7.28/47/51. She was started on a nitro drip and lasix IV. She
had rales all the way up and upon emergent intubation, froth was
visualized in ET tube.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
afebrile, BP 126/76, HR 74,
Gen: pleasant and cooperative
HEENT: MMM, CN II-XII grossly intact
Cor: RRR III/VI systolic murmur heard throughout the precordium
Pulm: mild crackles bilaterally
Abd: soft, NT ND + BS
Ext: WWP, friable skin, trace pitting edema LE bilaterally, left
toe with 2 x 2 cm ulcer. Pedal pulses not palpable but are
dopplerable.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: The heart size is enlarged compared to the film from the
prior day. There is bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right. There is increased retrocardiac opacity that may be
due to effusion/consolidation/atelectasis. There is pulmonary
vascular redistribution. Compared to the film from the prior
day, the effusions are larger, the retrocardiac opacity is
greater but the remainder of the lungs have a slightly improved
appearance.

EKG with increased lateral ST segment depressions and TW
inversions.

TTE Conclusions: Ejection Fraction: 40%. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate-to-severe aortic valve stenosis with mild aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2183-2-24**],
the mean pressure gradient across the aortic valve is marginally
reduced.

catheterization with Common iliac stenting:
1. Retrograde access of bilateral CFA were obtained.
2. Diffuse peripheral vascular disease was noted in bilateral
lower
extremities. The abdominal aorta had mild distal disease. The
renal
arteries were single without apparent flow-limiting disease.
3. The right lower extremity had proximal disease. The CIA had a
70%
origin lesion with mild calcification. The EIA had mild disease
that was
no flow-limiting. The CFA was without flow-limiting disease.
4. The left lower extremity had disease througout its course.
The CIA
had a long tubular 80% lesion. The EIA had mild diffuse disease.
The
CFA was without flow-limiting disease. The SFA was totally
occluded
proximally. The PFA provided robust collaterals to the
popliteal. The
PT and PA supply run-off to the foot. The AT is severely
diseased with
reconstitution of the DP from PA collaterals.
5. Limited hemodynamics revealed a significant lesion in both
the RFA
and LFA compared to the central aorta with a 15 mmHg gradient
noted
after administration of IA nitroglycerin. This gradient
disappeared
after intervention. Opening pressures were markedly elevated
with blood
pressure 210/69 mmHg.
6. Successful stenting of bilateral CIA with "kissing stents"
using a
7.0 x 28 mm Omnilink in the right and 7.0 x 38 mm Omnilink in
the left.
postdilation was with 7.0 mm balloons. Final angiography
demonstrated no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and
normal
flow. FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Bilateral common iliac artery disease.
2. Severe diffuse arterial disease in the left lower extremity.
3. Severe central hypertension.
4. Successful treatment of bilateral CIA disease with stenting.

cardiac catheterization: COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant
system with
severe 3-vessel coronary disease.  The LMCA was heavily
calcified with a
distal 70% stenosis involving the origin of the LAD and LCx.
The LAD
had heavy proximal calcification and an ostial 90% stenosis.
The prior
LAD stent was widely patent, and there was mild distal diffuse
disease.
The LCx had an ostial calcific 80% stenosis.  The RCA had an
ostial 80%
stenosis.  The previous RCA stent was widely patent.  There was
also a
60% stenosis in the distal RCA at the origin of the RPDA.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right- and mildly
elevated
left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 6 mmHg, mean PCW 13 mmHg).
 The
pulmonary artery pressure was moderately elevated (mean PA 34
mmHg).
The cardiac output was low-normal at 2.3 L/min/m2.  Simultaneous

measurement of arterial and left ventricular pressures critical
aortic
stenosis.  The peak-peak gradient across the aortic valve was 78
mmHg,
the mean gradient was 56 mmHg, and the calculated aortic valve
area was
0.48 cm2.  Post-valvuloplasty (see below), the peak-peak
gradient
decreased to 32 mmHg, the mean gradient to 28 mmHg, and the
calculated
valve area increased to 0.69 cm2.
3. Successful aortic valvuloplasty with a 22 x 60 mm balloon.
Final
valve calculation demonstrated a valve area of 0.69 cm2. No
apparent
complications were noted after the procedure (See PTCA
Comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe 3-vessel coronary disease.
2. Minimal diastolic dysfunction.
3. Critical aortic stenosis.
4. Successful aortic baloon valvuloplasty without apparent
complications.

extremity catheterization:
1. Retrograde access was obtained via the right femoral artery
to the
contralateral TPT. There was mild distal aortic disease. The
previously
placed right iliac artery stent was without significant
stenoses. The
prior left iliac artery stent was without significant stenoses.
The left
common femoral artery was without obstructive disease. The left
superficial femoral artery was totally occluded at its origin.
The left
profunda femoris artery supplied collaterals to the popliteal
artery.
The trifurcation was without significant disease though the
posterior
tibial artery was totally occluded proximally. The peroneal and
anterior
tibial arteries filled the ankle to the foot.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal central blood
pressures
of 135/43 mmHg.
3. Successful placement of three overlapping self-expanding
stents in
the previously, chronically, totally occluded left SFA (from
proximal to
distal 7.0 x 38 mm Dynalink, 7.0 x 100 mm Dynalink, and 6.0 x
100 mm
Dynalink) all postdilated with a 5.0 mm balloon. Final
angiography
demonstrated a 10% residual stenosis and normal flow (See PTCA
Comments).
4. Successful treatment of popliteal artery with a 5.0 x 40 mm
cryoplasty balloon over 5 inflations. Final angiography
demonstrated a
10% residual stenosis and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
5. Successful placement of 7.0 x 28 mm Genesis stent in the
disrupted
right common iliac artery stent as well as balloon angioplasty
using the
stent delivery balloon in the left common iliac artery stent to
smooth
out the struts due to this difficult procedure.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Totally occluded left superficial femoral artery (SFA).
2. Totally occluded posterior tibial artery.
3. Normal central blood pressure.
4. Successful placement of self-expanding stents in left SFA.
5. Successful cryoplasty of left SFA into popliteal artery.
6. Successful placement of stent in right common iliac artery.
7. Successf
