Imaging:
Head CT ([**9-15**]):
IMPRESSION: Hyperdense sellar mass extending to suprasellar
region, most
likely a pituitary macroadenoma. MRI of sella would be helpful
for further
evaluation.

Head CTA([**9-15**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Sellar mass with suprasellar extension and potential mass
effect upon the optic chiasm. MRI is recommended if possible to
further evaluate these
structures. Diagnostic possibilities include macroadenoma, with
or without
hemorrhage, and less likely a Rathke's cleft cyst.
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. However, the density
of hte lesion itself may reflect prior bleeding. Pituitary
apoplexy cannot be excluded on CT imaging. Normal CTA circle of
[**Location (un) 431**].

Cards ECHO([**9-16**])
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional left ventricular systolic
function. Mild global right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mechanical mitral valve prosthesis with borderline-high
gradients. Normally-functioning tricuspid annuloplasty ring.
Mild pulmonary hypetension.

CXR [**9-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
2. Unchanged cardiomegaly.
3. Subsegmental atelectasis left lung base.

Head CT [**9-21**]:
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW:
1) No short-interval change in hyperattenuating, round primarily
intrasellar mass with suprasellar extension, remodeling the
dorsum sellae; dDx includes macroadenoma, perhaps with
hemorrhage, as well as intrasellar
craniopharyngioma or Rathke cyst.
2) Possibly low-lying cerebellar tonsils (unrelated), which
should be
clarified at time of MRI.

Head CT [**9-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Posteroperative chcanges of trans-sphenoidal resection of
pituitary mass, with decreased volume of mass within the sella
turcica.



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**9-15**] via ED with complaint of Nausea and
vomiting for three days. Head ct was performed and a pituitary
mass identified.
Dx:Non-hem. pituitary lesion. After adequate work up and
consults with opthomology for visual field testing and
endocrinology, transpenoidal pituitary resection was conducted
on [**9-21**]. Post operatively her neuro exam was completely intact,
but there was question as to her pacemaker working appropriated.
It was interrogated, and deemed appropriate. Diuretic therapy
was withheld for several days post operatively to ensure the
absence of DI symptoms. She was restarted on Lasix on [**9-28**] at
60mg twice daily, as she appeared to be adequately diuresed
after surgery.  Serum sodium and osm, as well as urine sodium,
osm, and specific gravity remained stable during
hospitalization, only requiring one dose of vasopressin on
POD#3. On POD#5, systemic heparin drip was started for her
mechanical valve.  Coumadin was restarted on [**2163-9-27**].  She
received the following doses, 10mg, 10mg, 15mg, and 5mg during
her hospitalization.  On [**10-2**] she was discharge to home without
the need of services with a INR of 2.5 and direction to follow
up with PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] AM for blood drawing to ensure adequate
INR level.
