Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17226**] was admitted to the I CU with respiratory distress
and chest pain. The pain was pleuritic in nature, and did not
sound cardiac. The pt was noted to have an elevated white count
and fever, likely secondary to pneumonia/pneumonitis. The pt's
repeat chest x-ray also showed a blossoming right-sided
infiltrate. The ICU team did consider the possibility of a
pulmonary embolism, and less likely aortic dissection, but no
there was no clear evidence for either. The pt was treated with
vancomycin and ceftriaxone for community acquired pneumonia. He
has a history of likely MAC colonization (TB already ruled out),
and azithromycin and Levaquin were not used so that they could
be saved to treat symptomatic MAC in the future, if needed. The
pt responded well to this treatment, and was quickly weaned of
pressors on his first ICU day. The next morning he began
wheezing, suggestive of a COPD flare. Therefore he was started
on IV steroids, and his inhalers were changed to Q4hr nebulizer
treatments. He stabilized on this regimen and was called out to
the floor. On the floor the pt remained afebrile. He was noted
to have penicillin sensitive S. pneumoniae growing in his
sputum. The pt's antibiotic regimen was changed to Amoxicillin.
He was also noted to have an elevated WBC count, in the setting
of being on steroids and diarrhea. A stool Cdiff toxin was
positive and the pt was
started on oral Flagyl. The pt was discharged with instructions
to follow-up with his PCP.
.
Pneumonia:
The pt was noted to have a right lower lobe pneumonia on CXR.
His sputum culture showed S. pneumoniae sensitive to
penicillins. The pt was started on a 10 day course of
Amoxicillin.
.
COPD Flare:
The pt was started on IV steroids in the ICU. These steroids
were tapered to PO prednisone. While on steroids he was noted to
have a rising WBC count. His WBC counts will need to be followed
as an out-patient.
.
Hypotension: It was unclear the hypotension was secondary to
sepsis vs. over-diuresis (pt was hypertensive on presentation to
ED, placed on a Nitro drip and 80 iv Lasix after which he became
hypotensive). He was placed on Levophed in the ICU, which was
gradually weaned off. The pt's hypotension did not appear to be
cardiac in etiology as his cardiac enzymes were negative.
.
Acute on chronic renal failure: (baseline Creatinine: 1.5)
The pt was noted to have acute on chronic renal failure for
which he was hydrated with IVF. His creatinine trended down from
1.9 to 1.3 on the day of discharge.
.
Elevated WBC count:
The pt was noted to have a rise in WBC count in the setting of
steroids and diarrhea. His stool for Cdiff toxin was positive.
The pt was initiated on oral Flagyl therapy which will be
continued to complete a 14 day course.
.
Anemia:
The pt was noted to have a hematocrit drop from 37.6 to 26.7.
This drop was attributed to hydration, but there was some
concern given guaiac positive status. The pt was noted to have a
gradual improvement in his HCT to 35.2 on discharge.
.
CV:
The pt has a history of CAD and atrial fibrillation. The pt was
not on Coumadin on admission. Per the pt's PCP the Coumadin was
held for a lung biopsy 2-3 weeks ago. The pt's home Coumadin
dose was restarted and he was continued on digoxin (dose
decreased to 0.0625 mg). No events were noted on telemetry. His
Coumdin became supratherapeutic on the day of discharge (to 4.0)
thus the dose of Coumadin will be held on [**2125-2-27**], with
instructions for the pt to have his INR checked on [**2125-3-1**] for
titration of Coumadin dose by the pt's PCP.
.
Oncology:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17226**] has NSCLC and RCC for which has had no treatment to
date. The pt was noted to have clinical stage II non small cell
lung cancer and was thought to not be a good candidate for
surgical resection, as it would require a pneumonectomy. He has
been evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3274**] and was offered
chemo-radiation. He is contemplating this option currently and
has been scheduled for follow-up in the [**Hospital **] clinic.
.
Gout:
The pt was continued on allopurinol for gout. He has no active
symptoms of gout.
.
Anxiety:
The pt was maintained on Celexa for anxiety.
.
Prophylaxis:
The pt was maintained on prophylaxis with SC Heparin and
Protonix. He had a RIJ placed [**2-17**] in the ED which was removed
prior to transfer to the floor.
.
FEN:
The pt was initially NPO, and then restarted on a cardiac diet
with no complications. Electrolytes were monitored and repleted.

.
He is DNR/DNI per his stated wishes
