CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2196-2-13**] 4:39 AM

CHEST AP:

The tip of the left IJ line lies in the left innominate vein.
There is no pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are again
seen, not significantly changed since the prior chest x-ray of
[**2-12**].

IMPRESSION: No change since prior chest x-ray. Failure persists.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Small
secundum ASD. The  IVC is normal in diameter with <50% decrease
during respiration (estimated RAP 11-15mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderately
depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No
MVP. Moderate  mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of
mitral valve chordae. No MS.  LV inflow pattern c/w restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated LA  pressure.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.


Conclusions:

A small secundum atrial septal defect is present. The estimated
right atrial  pressure is 11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic  function is mildly
to moderately depressed with global hypokinesis (the  inferior
and infero-lateral walls appear slightly more hypokinetic in
some  views). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is  mildly dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. The aortic  valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral  valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse.  The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling  abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets  are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2196-2-8**]  4:33:34 PM

Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular response rate, 97
with ventricular premature depolarizations. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities
consistent with left ventricular strain pattern. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2196-2-3**] multiple abnormalities persist
without major change.
