Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic coronary angiography
Coronary angiography and stent placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85 year old female with hypertension and
diabetes who presented to ED with atypical CP. The patient began
to experience chest pressure at 5:30 AM on [**2156-6-7**] after eating
breakfast.  It was located in the left side of her chest and
radiated to her shoulder and to her back.  It was not associated
with nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, lightheadedness,
palpitaions, or any other symptoms.  Her husband called EMS.
She received one dose of sublingual nitroglycerine and it
resolved.  She was brought to the BIMDC ED.
.
In the ED she was noted to be afrebrile with a heart rate of 70
and a blood pressure of 240/120.  Her hypertension was
controlled with 5 mg IV lopressor.  She also received 20 mg
lasix.  While in the ED she had two sets of negative cardiac
enzymes.  EKG with non-specific inferior T-wave changes.  A
persantine MIBI was performed with equivocal EKG changes but
nuclear imaging showed a reversible anterior/apical defects and
TID. The patient did experience one episode of chest pain of
similar quality while in the ED on the evening of presentation.
It resolved by itself.
.
On review of symptoms she denies fevers, chills, cough,
shortness of breath.  She denies lightheadedness or dizziness.
She denies prior episodes of chest pain or palpitations.  She
denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, BRBPR.
She denies PND, orthopnea, nocturia.  She does have peripheral
edema at baseline and this is unchanged.

Images:
CXR: PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to [**2155-4-17**].
The heart size is top normal. The aorta is mildly elongated with
aortic arch calcifications. There is mild bronchial wall
thickening and Kerley B lines are seen bilaterally in the lower
lobes. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are
no focal lung infiltrates or masses.
The patient is after cholecystectomy.
IMPRESSION: CHF with mild interstitial edema.
.
EKG: NSR, borderline first degree AV block, LAD, RBBB with left
anterior fascicular block, inferior T wave changes that are
non-specific.
.
Exercise Stress:
IMPRESSION: Equivocal EKG changes in the absence of anginal
symptoms.
.
Persantine MIBI:
IMPRESSION:  1.  Abnormal myocardial perfusion study
demonstrating a severe, predominantly reversible defect in the
distal anterior wall and apex consistent with a lesion in the
mid to distal LAD.    2. Transient cavitary dilatation is
present.  3. Apical hypokinesis (LVEF @ 53%)
.
Cardiac Cathterization [**2156-6-9**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
40% LMCA lesion and severe three vessel disease (diffuse). The
LAD had a  long segnemt of proxinmal and mid vessel lesion with
most severe lesion being 99%. There was an ostial D1 lesion. The
LCX had an 80% ostial lesion and was diffusely diseased. The RCA
had a 90% ostial lesion with
mild diffuse disease throughout.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Limited hemodynamic assessment showed markedly elevated
systemic aortic pressures.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.

*** Not Signed Out ***
COMMENTS:
1) Dissection of the left main with guide engagement resulting
in
successful stenting of the left main with a 3.0x18 mm Cypher
stent
postdilated to 4.0 mm.
2) Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal and mid LAD with
a
3.0x23mm Cypher, 2.5x18mm Cypher stent, and a 2.5x13mm Cypher
stent.
3) Successful stenting of the proximal and mid CX with a
3.0x33mm Cypher
stent and a 3.0x18mm Cypher stent both postdilated to 3.5mm.
4) Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow in the LM, LAD, and CX.
(see PTCA
comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the left main after dissection
3. Successful stenting of the LAD and CX
.
ECHO ([**6-11**])
Conclusions:
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
ejection fraction is normal (LVEF 60%); there is a significant
area of apical hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

C. Cath ([**6-14**])
COMMENTS:
1) Initial coronary angiography revealed a 95% ostial RCA lesion
and
widely patent left main, LAD, and Cx stents with mild diffuse
disease.
2) Renal angiography revealed an 80% proximal left renal artery
lesion
and a 30% right renal artery lesion.
3) Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with a 3.5x18
mm
Cypher Rx stent which was post-dilated to 4.0 mm.  Final
angiography
revealed a 10% residual lesion, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
(see
PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Left 80% renal artery stenosis.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 85 year old female with hypertension and
diabetes who presented to emergency room following one episode
of atypical CP.
.
Coronary Artery Disease: In the emergency department the patient
had three sets of negative cardiac enzymes and no EKG changes.
She underwent a PMIBI which showed a reversible defect in the
territory of the mid LAD.  She was started on a heparin drip and
received aspirin and metoprolol.  On [**2156-6-9**] she underwent
diagnostic cardiac cath
