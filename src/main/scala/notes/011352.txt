Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-12-23**] Aortic Valve Replacement (#19mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue)/Mitral
Valve repair (#26mm CE Phsio ring)


History of Present Illness:
This is a 58yo female with known valvular heart disease and
COPD. Recently presented to OSH in [**Month (only) 216**] with chest and
epigastric pain along with shortness of breath. Troponins were
mildly elevated at that time. She underwent extensive cardiac
workup which included echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization
which revealed moderate aortic stenosis and insufficiency along
with moderate mitral
regurgitation. Based upon the above results, she was referred
for cardiac surgical evaluation. Her current symptoms include
dyspnea on exertion and two pillow orthopnea. She currently
denies chest pain, SOB at rest, syncope, presyncope, pedal
edema, fevers and chills.

Pertinent Results:
[**2132-12-23**] Intraop TEE -
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size is
top normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with XXX. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
POST CPB:
1. Improve global LV systolic function /EF +50% (Epinephrine
Infusion)
2. Preserved right ventricular systolci function
3. Full annuloplasty ring identrified in the mitral position.
Well seated and no leaflet restriction. Peak gradient = 4 mm Hg.
MVA by PHT = > 3 cm2
4. Bioprosthetic valve in aortic position. Well seated and
stable with good leaflet excursion. No AI and PG = 19 mm Hg.
Intact aorta. No other change.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2132-12-23**] patient underwent aortic valve replacement (#19mm
St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue) and mitral valve repair with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. CROSS
CLAMP TIME=105MINUTES. CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME=128 minutes.
Please refer to operative report for further surgical details.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring. She awoke agitated and was given
Precedex with good effect and was weaned to extubation on POD1
morning. Later that day she developed mental status changes. She
required Lorazepam for agitation and CPAP for hypercarbia
secondary to sedation necesssary to prevent self injury. She
went into respiratory distress, developed a respiratory acidosis
and was reintubated. It was thought that her mental status
changes were due to alcohol withdrawl vs toxic metabolic
encephalopathy post bypass.  She was started on Versed and
Fentanyl, new lines were placed and she was kept intubated for
several days. On [**2132-12-26**] she was weaned from the ventilator and
sedation and extubated without incident. She was given
nebulizers and Flovent with a history of smoking and intravenous
Tylenol for pain.  She weaned off intravenous antihypertensives,
was started on PO beta-blockade. All lines and drains were
discontinued per protocol and without complication. She remained
in the CVICU until postoperative day five due to postoperative
confusion and tenuous pulmonary status. She was transferred to
the step down unit for further monitoring. Physical Therapy was
consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility. Beta blockade
was titrated up for better heart rate control and Lisinopril was
added for blood pressure control and depressed LV function(EF
35%). On postoperative day seven, she became slightly
tachycardic and short of breath.  She was given additional Lasix
with improvement in symptoms. She gradually weaned off oxygen
with a sat of 92-97% on room air at the time of discharge. At
time of discharge, she was ambulating without difficulty,
tolerating a full oral diet and surgical incisions were healing
well. She continued to progress and was ready for discharge to
[**Hospital **] Nursing and Rehab on postoperative day eight. All
follow up appointments were advised and arranged prior to
discharge.
