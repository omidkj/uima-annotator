HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 103774**] is an 84 year-old
man with an extensive past medical history including end
stage renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes type 2,
gastrointestinal bleed, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure with an
ejection fraction of 15 and is status post a cerebrovascular
accident who presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] Intensive Care Unit after an episode of hypotension
following dialysis catheter placement.  He was also noted to
be tachycardic.  The patient was rehydrated, but
unfortunately his blood pressure remained low in the 80s with
a mean arterial pressure in the 40s and 50s.  He was treated
with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl for suspected sepsis,
however, the patient's blood pressure failed to improve and
it was believed this was due to his worsening ischemic
cardiomyopathy with a known EF of 14% prior to this
presentation.  The patient was placed on pressor medications
with little improvement in his blood pressure, which remained
too low to have hemodialysis performed.  After consultation
with the family and with the kidney specialist, a family
meeting was held and it was determined that the patient's
wife Mrs. [**Known lastname 103774**] requested to have her husband made as
comfortable as possible, taken off any pressor medications
and made comfort measures only.  He was then transferred to
the floor where he received morphine prn for pain and for
respiratory distress.  Over the two days on the floor the
patient gradually deteriorate with worsening blood pressure,
tachycardia and an increasing respiratory rate.  On the
evening of [**1-3**], the patient expired.  He remained as
comfortable as possible throughout the last few days at the
[**Hospital1 69**].  The patient's wife
refused a post mortem examination and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] his
attending was notified.  The patient's wife was at the
bedside at the time of death.
