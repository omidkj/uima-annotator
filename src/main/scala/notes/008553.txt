ADDENDUM:

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  In addition to the prior dictated
summaries the patient was scheduled to be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.  However, on the morning of [**2140-4-5**]
repeat laboratories revealed an elevated BUN and creatinine
of 48 and 2.8 from a creatinine of 2.1 previously.  Due to
the rise in his creatinine the decision was made to delay his
discharge.  He was given additional intravenous hydration and
his creatinine came down to 2.6.  A repeat renal ultrasound
was performed on [**2140-4-6**] which again revealed bilateral
nonobstructing renal calculi with no hydronephrosis and an
empty bladder.  He was given additional intravenous
hydration.  Renal was contact[**Name (NI) **] and from their perspective he
was stable to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility and
follow up with them in clinic.  This was thought to be from
mild dehydration.  In addition his Levofloxacin was stopped
in case this was contributing to his worsening renal
function.  In addition, he had a few episodes of atrial
fibrillation and a rapid heart rate and as noted on his
telemetry was in and out of atrial fibrillation.  His
Lopressor dose increased to 150 mg three times a day and he
remained rate controlled with rhythm between sinus rhythm,
atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter pattern.  Additionally his
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain was noted to be putting out more fluid of
a brownish initially thick then thin consistency up to 200 cc
per day.  The decision was made then to limit his oral intake
and to change him to the Carnation Instant Breakfast three
times a day by his G tube and to give him additional
hydration via his G tube with him taking only sips of water
or small sips of ice chips by mouth until he follows up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
See prior summary.

2.  With Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6073**] from cardiology on [**2140-5-2**] at 3
P.M., phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2386**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Diet, only small sips of water or ice chips by mouth
until follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at which time his [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**]
drain will be pulled if the output is low.
2.  Sugar free Carnation Instant Breakfast via G tube three
times a day.
3.  The G tube is remain clamped between feedings and to be
unclamped and placed to gravity if there is any abdominal
distention or nausea or vomiting.
4.  He is to receive a total of 2 liters of additional water
via his G tube.  This can be divided in 500 cc aliquots given
four times a day.
5.  His [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain is to remain in place to bulb
suction.  The output is to be recorded and sent in with him
when he follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2140-4-14**].
6.  He is to be anticoagulated.  However, his [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**]
drain will likely be pulled by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on his follow up so he
is not to receive any Coumadin until he follows up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  He would have received his last dose of Coumadin on
[**2140-4-7**] and his INR as of [**2140-4-6**] is 2.8.  After he follows
