carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

         Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.

[**2177-2-13**] 3:04 pm URINE  - NGTD

Imaging:

- ECG	Study Date of [**2177-2-5**]  3:43:54 PM
Sinus bradycardia with left bundle-branch block and secondary
ST-T wave
abnormalities with occasional premature ventricular
contractions. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2177-1-27**] the
occasional ventricular premature beats are new. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

- CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2177-2-5**] 3:52 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Thickened, enhancing wall of the sigmoid colon concerning for
colitis;
infectious or inflammatory causes most likely, less likely
ischemic
2. Hyperemic small bowel, in some places may be minmally
thickened, with
normal caliber IVC, may indicate enteritis less likely sequela
of hypovolemia.
3. Mildly thickened, hyperemic gastric wall, may be due to
gastritis.
Recommend clinical correlation and consider endoscopy if not
performed
recently to exclude a more aggressive process.
4. 24 x 15 mm hypodensity near the pancreatic head, difficult to
discern
whether pancreatic in origin vs duodenal/gastric diverticulum vs
biliary(if
there is a history of prior pancreatitis, pseudocyst would be
another
consideration). Second hypodensity in the pancreatic body may be
a cystic
neoplasm (IMPN). Recommend MRCP for further evaluation.
5. Ventral wall hernia without evidence of obstruction, but with
small amout of fluid in hernia sac, new since the prior study,
may be reactive

- CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2177-2-5**] 4:26 PM
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.
