Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted and underwent laparoscopic incisional hernia
repair with mesh. She tolerated the procedure very well. On
postoperative day one her urine output decreased and her
creatinine rose to 2.2. She was bolused with intravenous fluids,
renal service was consulted and she was monitored closely in the
intensive care unit. With fluids her urine output picked up and
her creatinine dropped back to baseline. On postoperative day
two she was started on clear liquids and resumed her lasix.

Currently she is tolerating a regular diet, passing gas and has
good pain control with oral narcotics. We will discharge her to
home with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and have instructed her
to follow up with her primary care and endocrinologist.
