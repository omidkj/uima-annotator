Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Caffeine / Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placed and removed
?EGD

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 83yo woman who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with 3
days of BRBPR found in her diaper. She has a medical history of
breast cancer s/p mastectomy, radiation, tamoxifen who had LN
recurrance 2 years ago treated initially with chemo and then
with radiation. More recently (6 weeks ago) she had a cerebellar
ICH/CVA, coag negative bacteremia and presumed endocarditis (on
vanco via PICC line) and c. diff colitis (with WBC max of 42,000
on [**5-26**] requiring flagyl + po vanco and associated with LGIB)
and a left superficial thrombosis associate with her PICC.
.
She was first noted to have blood clots mixed with her stool on
[**6-9**] and which worsened over the next 3 days. She was transfused
2U pRBC on [**6-6**] and [**6-10**].
.
In the ED her vs were stable; 99.2, HR in 80-90's, systolics in
120's, O2sat 90's on RA. Her physical exam showed her to be
alert and would open eyes to command (unclear baseline), benign
abdomin, bright red blood in diaper, rectal not done. NG tube
was already in place from [**Hospital1 **] (but above the diaphragm).
Reportedly an aspiration showed gastric contents without blood.
Hct was 27.2 and plts 54. She was transfused plts. CXR showed NG
tube mal-placement.
.
Surgery was made aware. GI was consulted and plans to see
patient on floor.
.
Unable to obtain ROS. [**Name (NI) **] son/HCP reports that since her
strokes 6 weeks ago that she is slow to respond, difficult to
wake up, but will respond with opening her eyes/shaking her head
and speaking, although her speach is difficult to understand. He
reports that her memory of people's identity is good, but she is
not oriented to place or time


Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
In the MICU, pt was found to be HIT positive and was taken off
all heparin products. She required numerous transfusions of
PRBCs but her VS never showed changes indicating HD compromise.
Rather, her transfusion requirements were similar to those she
experienced as an outpatient. Abd CT showed an enlarging splenic
infarct.
Her mental status slowly improved over the course of her MICU
course such that she was responsive and more alert upon call out
to the floor but still only A and O x1.1
_______________________________

#Lower GI Bleed - Patient was initially admitted for the
hospital for passing blood clots mixed with stool.  She
initially required multiple units of PRBCs.  EGD done while in
the unit was unrevealing for a source of bleeding.  Initially
colonoscopy was deferred because it was thought to be of limited
utility and benefit.  While on the floor, the patient's HCT was
initially stable.  She was continued on IV flagyl for her CDiff
colitis, which was thought to be a possible source of her
bleeding.  Her HCT started trending down and there was noted to
be a few clots and some blood mixed with the stool.  She was
again transfused 2 units PRBCs.  GI was again consulted and they
decided to perform a colonoscopy to attempt to identify a source
of continued bleeding.  Colonoscopy only showed multiple
diverticuli and internal hemorrhoids, both of which were thought
to be possible sources of her GI bleeding.
.
#Recent CVA and Intracranial hemorrhage - Before this admission,
the patient had a history of multiple embolic strokes as well as
an acute intracranial hemorrhage.  After initial discharge from
the MICU, there was a question of possible anticoagulation in
this patient because of concern for HIT.  A repeat MRI was
performed which showed an interval increase in embolic
phenomenom as well as a subacute on chronic hemorrhage.  Repeat
echo was performed to evaluate embolic strokes.  Again, no
vegitations were seen on the cardiac valves and no PFO was seen.
.
#Thrombocytopenia - There was an initial concern for HIT in this
patient.  Hematology was consulted to help with assessment for
the diagnosis and determination if anticoagulation is needed.
With regard to the diagnosis of HIT, it is unlikely that she has
this.  Her thrombocytopenia has been going throughout her
inpatient stay at both the [**Hospital1 18**] and [**Hospital1 **] hospitals.  In
addition, there are many confounding factors for this finding,
including consecutive infections and polypharmacy (vancomycin,
ciprofloxacin).  Furthermore, her optical density value is 0.45
and the cut-off for a positive test result is 0.40.
Publications support an optical density of 1.0 better for the
diagnosis of HIT.  For these
reasons, the heme service did not believe that she had HIT and
thus argatroban was not indicated.
.
#Coag Neg Staff Endocarditis - On past admission, the patient
had 4/4 bottles positive for coag neg staff.  T
