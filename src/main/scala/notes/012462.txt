Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers, hypotension at HD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of a tunnelled dialysis catheter.


History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 75 year-old male with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p MI and
vfib arrest [**2183**] s/p AICD, CHF (EF 20%), atrial fibrillation,
HTN who presented from HD in [**Location (un) 2498**] with a fever to 101.6F and
hypotension. Mr. [**Known lastname 18575**] reports feeling in his usual state of
health until the evening PTA, when he [**Last Name (un) 4996**] to have a headache
and difficulty sleeping, though denies any fevers, chills, night
sweats, or dyspnea. Shortly after arrival to his HD session on
the day of admission, he began to have rigors, chills, and was
noted to be diaphoretic and cyanotic. He was given vancomycin 1g
and 100mg gentamicin, and referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Of note, Mr.
[**Known lastname 18575**] also had a much abbreviated HD session, reportedly
secondary to difficulty with his L tunneled HD line. He denies
noticing any recent discharge from his line, or any tenderness
around the line.

On ED arrival, T=100.5, P96, BP 73/36, RR 20 sat 96%. BP
increased with a saline bolus (unclear from [**Name (NI) **] records how much
fluid he received, though appears to be 250cc fluid) as well as
empiric levofloxacin 500mg. BP increased to 90-100's, and
lactate declined from 2.5 -> 1.6. However, he then became more
hypotensive to sbp 70's, looked more lethargic, ICU evaluation
called.
He denied any recent sick contacts, cough, sore throat,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, or new rashes.  Just feels
generalized fatigue.

He spent one evening in the MICU where his blood pressure was
stabilized with NS boluses.  He defervesced. He received one
dose of vancomycin when he was discovered to have 4/4 bottles
with GPC.  His tunnelled catheter was removed by IR today.

At the time of transfer, the pt. stated that he felt "great."
He offered no complaints.  He specifically denied fever, chills,
rigors, chest pain, SOB, N/V/D.  Denied pain.

Pertinent Results:
[**2188-5-3**]:
CHEST AP: There is stable cardiomegaly. The aorta is unfolded.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Single lead ICD and

pulmonary vascular congestion. Diffusely increased interstitial
markings are noted. There are no definite pleural effusions.
Osseous and soft tissue structures are stable.
IMPRESSION: Pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia.

TTE ([**2188-5-5**])
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right  atrium is moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity  is moderately dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. [Intrinsic  left
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
severity of  valvular regurgitation.] Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include  inferior, inferolateral and septal
akinesis. The remaining left ventricular  segments are
hypokinetic.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is mild global
right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No AI
seen. No mass seen on aortic valve [**Last Name (un) **].
6. The mitral valve leaflets are normal. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. No mass seen on the mitral valve.
7.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
8. There ia an echogenic density in the right ventricle
consistent with a wire (AICD).
Impression: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
No change from the previous study of [**2187-12-5**].


Brief Hospital Course:
1. MRSA bacteremia:  The source was felt to be due to a
tunnelled line infection given the temporal relation of the
symptoms to use of the dialysis line.  Cultures from
hemodialysis center and the first set of cultures at the [**Hospital1 18**]
grew out MRSA.  The dialysis line was removed by the IR service
on hospital day 2.  He was given vancomycin, dosed by level.  He
defervesced over the course of the first hospital day.  A TTE
was performed on hospital day three and was not suggestive of
endocarditis.  There was no murmur on [**Hospital1 **].  Surveillance
cultures remained negative.  He was discharged with the plan
that he was to receive an additional 2 week course of vancomycin
to be dosed by level at hemodialysis (to complete a three week
course).

2. ESRD: The hemodialysis catheter was removed on hospital day
2.  He was followed by the renal service who felt that the pt.
did not re
