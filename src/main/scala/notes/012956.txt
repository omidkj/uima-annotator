Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old male
transferred from an outside hospital in Bermuda for liver
transplant evaluation.

In early [**2148**], the patient's wife noted an increase in his
abdominal girth, clumsiness, tremor, and skin color changes.
Over the Summer, his symptoms rapidly progressed.  At a
hospital in Bermuda, cirrhosis was diagnosed by abnormal
liver function tests and ultrasound.

The patient was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical Center on
[**2148-9-10**] where a workup revealed a negative workup for
hepatitis C.  Iron studies were negative.  Normal anti-SM,
RNP.  Normal alpha-1 antitrypsin.  Normal rapid plasma
reagin.  A magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 2.5-cm
hepatic nodule, nonmalignant on ultrasound-guided fine-needle
aspiration.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed four
large tortuous varices that were banded at that procedure as
well as gastropathy.  Serum ceruloplasmin was slightly low.

The patient was subsequently seen by an ophthalmologist in
Bermuda who noted Kayser-Fleischer rings.  Upon return to
Bermuda, penicillamine was started for a presumptive
diagnosis of Wilson's disease.

He was admitted to an outside hospital on [**2148-11-3**]
with generalized weakness and falls.  At that time, the
penicillamine was held for concern of myasthenic reaction.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for transplant evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cirrhosis (as above).
2.  Pericarditis.
3.  Viral syndrome with fevers, chills, cerebrovascular pain,
and pericarditis.
4.  Hand injury with a circular saw.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lactulose 30 cc p.o. six times per day.
2.  Nadolol 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Spironolactone 100 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Vitamin K 10 mg intravenously q.d.
6.  Albumin 50 g intravenously q.d.
7.  Ranitidine 50 mg intravenously q.12h.
8.  Metronidazole 500 mg intravenously b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a welder.  He has CCL4 exposure.  He
lives in Bermuda.  He traveled to Batswana in [**2140**].  Trained
with Bermuda armed forces in camp lives in [**Doctor First Name 5256**].
Vaccinated times three against hepatitis B virus.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Father died of a stroke at the age of 76.
Mother and sister are alive and well.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Review of systems on this admission
revealed no fevers or chills.  Positive for nausea and
vomiting.  After starting penicillamine he admits to
shortness of breath correlating with the increased abdominal
girth.  No chest pain.  Positive abdominal discomfort and
back pain.  No dysuria.  No stool passage for several days.
No bleeding from nose, mouth, rectum, or noted in stools.  He
admits to difficulty swallowing.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed temperature was 95.5, blood pressure
was 116/82, heart rate was 64, respiratory rate was 24,
oxygen saturation was 93% to 94% on room air.  In general, he
was an ill-appearing and jaundiced, in no apparent distress.
He had icteric sclerae.  Pupils were 3 mm and reactive to
light.  Oral mucosa was dry.  The neck was supple.  Normal
jugular venous distention.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
anteriorly.  Heart had a regular rate and rhythm, normal
sinus.  Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was tense, positive
fluid wave, dullness to percussion.  Extremities with 1 to 2+
pitting lower extremity edema bilaterally.  Skins with spider
angiomata and palmar erythema.  Neurologically, he was alert.
He responded to questions with blinks, thumbs up, and
occasional whispers.  He appeared to attend to questions
well.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  The
patient would not maintain upward gaze long enough to assess
fatigability.  Perioral and facial muscles were weak.  Deep
tendon reflexes were 2+ in biceps, brachioradialis, 1+
quadriceps.  Strength was [**4-26**], deltoids, biceps, and triceps
bilaterally; 4-/5 in the left.  Flexion extension was 3+/5 in
the right, 3+ hip flexion bilaterally, [**4-26**] knee flexion, knee
extension and ankle flexion and ankle extension bilaterally.
Finger-to-nose was slow with fine intention tremor and
possible fatigability.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
from the [**Hospital 44961**] hospital on [**1-5**] revealed white blood
cell count was 7.5, hematocrit was 35.7, and platelets were
70.  Sodium was 129, potassium was 3.9, chloride was 100,
blood urea nitrogen was 26, creatinine was 0.8, and blood
glucose was 95.  ALT was 82, AST was 136, alkaline
phosphatase was 176, total bilirubin was 4, direct bilirubin
was 0.2.  Total protein was 5.4.  Pulmonary function tests
showed no obstruction.

CODE STATUS ON ADMISSION:  Do not resuscitate/do not intubate
(per patient).

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted for evaluation
for possible liver transplant.  In addition, a therapeutic
paracentesis was recommended.  He was continued on his
nadolol and diuretics.

Part of the workup for the liver transplant was to evaluate
the diffuse muscle weakness as well as the possible
fatigability.  It was most likely thought to be a myesthetic
syndrome secondary to penicillamine.  Thus, the penicillamine
was discontinued.

Speech and Swallow was also consulted in order to evaluate
the patient's ability to protect the airway due to his bulbar
weakness.  The patient failed the Speech and Swallow
evaluation, and thus was recommended for an alternate
nutrition source.

In addition, due to the patient's progressive weakness,
negative inspiratory forces were recorded to monitor the
patient's ability to breathe, and to determine at what point
he would need to be ventilated to be maintained.  It was due
to the concern over his respiratory status that the patient
was admitted from the Medicine Service to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

The patient was managed supportively while the liver workup
was in progress; which included multiple laboratory studies
in addition to an Ophthalmology examination to again look for
Kayser-Fleischer rings which were found bilaterally and
superiorly.

It was eventually determined on [**11-8**], given the
uncertainty of his neuromuscular disorder and polyneuropathy,
he was not a transplant patient candidate.  During this time
he was being maintained with nasogastric tube feedings in
addition to CPAP to help with his respirations.

Around this time, it was determined that he appeared to be
fatiguing with respirations, and discussed with the family
whether he would want to be intubated in order to continue
potential aggressive care to see if the neuropathy resolved
in order to make him a transplant candidate.  Initially, the
patient stated that he would only be intubated if it could be
less than for 24 hours, which was not guaranteed.

On [**11-9**], Mr. [**Known lastname 44962**] agreed to an elective intubation in
order to maintain an aggressive level of care; i.e.,
nutrition and physical therapy in order to strengthen him to
become a liver transplant candidate should his neurologic
issues resolve.  The patient was continued at this level of
care and was also started on pyridostigmine as well as other
neurologic agents in order to attempt to reverse his
neuropathy.

Even with the aggressive level of care, the patient was noted
to have progressive weakness and was no longer able to
communicate.

Of note, during his stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit,
he also was hypotensive, requiring pressors to maintain blood
pressure.

On [**11-21**], the patient had a percutaneous tracheostomy
performed without difficulty in order to better ventilate.
Throughout his stay, the patient continued to have waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, primarily unresponsive.  In addition,
he continued to have hypotensive episodes, requiring normal
saline resuscitation in addition to pressors.

On [**11-26**], the patient was noted to be hypotensive during
the afternoon, and at a
