Allergies:
Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 107485**] is a 61yo M with ESRD on HD (last HD yesterday)
and AF not on coumadin who presented from hus nursing home with
vomitting and decreased po intake. He also endorsed SOB and
chest pain, which is reportedly chronic. Pt denied hematemesis,
dark stools, or BRBPR.

Initially ED vitals T 98.5, HR 170, BP 103/89, RR 20, O2 sat
100%. He triggered for tacycardia. ECG showed AFib with RVR.
Initially, the tacycardia was thought to be [**2-15**] dehydration, and
he was given 2L without improvement in his HR. Tm in the ED
100.6; he got Tylenol x1. CXR showed B/L opacities, concerning
for PNA vs volume. He was given vanc/levoflox. He was given
boluses of dilt, followed by a drip. he briefly dropped
pressures to 90s, came back up with slowing HR.

Other issues in the ED include a glucose of 50, for which he
recieved D50. K was 5.8 on arrival. there were no pleaked T
waves, and he was given Calcium gluconate, insulin, and D50.

He was hemodynamically stable upon transfer to the MICU.

Of note, he was last admitted [**Date range (1) 107563**] for AFib with RVR
leading to volume overload and respiratory distress requiring
BiPAP on admission. He required HD for volume control. Of note,
patient has CHADS-2 score of 3, but is maintained on [**Date range (1) **]
prophylaxis due to history of GI bleed. Hyperthyroidism was
thought to be contibuting to A fib last admission, and he was
discharged on methimazole. His course was complicated by On
[**8-16**], the patient first complained of new onset right lower
extremity calf pain, followed by dense sensory loss of right
foot late on [**8-17**] with loss of plantar and dorsiflexion of ankle.
Neurology suspected compressive sciatic nerve neuropathy; MRI of
lumbar spine showed no evidence of mass or cauda equina
syndrome.

On the floor, pt is sleeping but arousable.

Microbiology:
blood cultures ([**9-1**]): negative
.
EKG:
[**9-1**]:  Probable atrial flutter with 2:1 A-V conduction with an
atrial rate of about 320 and a ventricular rate of about 160.
Poor R wave progression.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Low QRS voltage in the limb
leads. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-8-15**] rapid atrial
flutter is present.
.
[**9-3**]:  Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
Since the previous tracing the rate slower.
.
[**9-5**]:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Borderline low limb lead voltage. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since
the previous tracing of [**2158-9-3**] the rate is faster. Otherwise,
findings are unchanged.
.
Imaging:
CXR ([**9-1**]):  IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with patchy opacities
in the lung bases which
may reflect atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.
Mild pulmonary
vascular congestion.
.
Arterial study of lower extremity ([**9-4**]): Normal triphasic
Doppler waveforms were acquired in the common femoral arteries
bilaterally. The Doppler waveform at the right popliteal,
posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis is monophasic. The Doppler
waveform at the left popliteal artery is still triphasic with
monophasic waveform at the posterior tibial artery and dorsalis
pedis. The ABI index on the right 0.58 and ABI index on the left
is 0.85. The pulse volume recordings are symmetrical.
IMPRESSION: Moderate outflow disease on the right at the level
of superficial femoral artery and posterior tibial artery and
mild outflow obstruction at the level of left posterior tibial
artery.
.
Lower extremity ultrasound ([**9-10**]):   IMPRESSION: No DVT in the
right lower extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
61yo M with DM, ESRD on HD, AF, sCHF (EF 30%), and
hyperthyroidism who presents from rehab with nausea and poor po
intake found to be in AF with RVR.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Rates to 170s initially.
Received 2L of fluids in the ED without improvement in HR. He
was given dilt boluses in the ED followed by gtt and transferred
to MICU. He had a transient hypotension to the 90s (SBP) in the
setting of rate and dilt gtt, however his pressures improved
with slowing his rate. He is not anticoagulated with coumadin
given history of GIB; on full-dose [**Month/Year (2) **]. His rate slowed to the
80s-90s and he was taken off of the dilt gtt and started on
Diltiazem 90mg Q6H. Had an admission 2 weeks ago where
hyperthyroism / thyrotoxicosis was felt to be contributing to
tachycardia. His TSH remained <0.02, and Endocrine was
reconsulted (see below).  His rate control improved with
treatmen
