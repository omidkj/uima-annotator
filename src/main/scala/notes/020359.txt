Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 43251**] was admitted on [**2104-7-18**]. She was prepared and
consented for surgery as per standard. In the operating room,
estimated blood loss was 1500cc. She received 2 units of packed
red blood cells and 5 litres of intravenous fluids in total. The
surgery was done in conjunction with the GYN service. Operative
notes are available on OMR. There were no complications during
the surgery. However, the Pt had transient hypotension during
the procedure and was put on Levophed. Upon completion, Ms
[**Known lastname 43251**] was taken to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU, where she was monitored
closely. Pt was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] hemodynamically stable,
not on pressors, and intubated. Initially, she was drowsy, on
propofol.  IN the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the following events occured:
.
.
1)Respiratory status- Pt extubated without events. Is currently
sating well on 3L NC.
.
2)S/P cystectomy- Transfused 1 U pRBC yesterday for post-op Hct
drop 35.1 --> 32.8 --> 28.8. Responded to Hct of 30.5. Started
on dilaudid PCA yesterday, and increased basal rate for pain
control. Pt has ileoconduit and continues to have adequate urine
output. s/p Cefazolin 1g IV q8 hrs X 3 doses for post-op
prophylaxis.
.
3)[**Name (NI) 12329**] pt's bp stable, no longer on pressors, continue to
monitor
.
4)Hypothyroidism- stable as outpt, continue Levothyroxine 137.5
mcg
.
5)Asthma - Albuterol/Atrovent MDIs prn. Resume home meds
(Advair).
.
6)[**Name (NI) 1623**] pt NPO, pt has NG tube. Tube feeds were held as was
expecting NGT to be d/c'd. Will f/u c surgery regarding length
of need for NGT. If pt continues to require NGT, will start tube
feeds. Will monitor lytes and replete prn
.
7) Access: PIV. may d/c a-line as BPs now stable, d/c central
venous catheter.
.
.
Once Ms [**Known lastname 43251**] was stable, she was then transfered to the floor
(12 Resiman) where she continued to progress. The ostomy nurse
visited her to [**Known lastname **] with changing her ostomy bag - an
interpreter was required, and at first, Ms [**Known lastname 43251**] did not make
much of an effort to learn how to change her bag independently.
Upon discharge, this did not improve greatly, as Ms [**Known lastname 43251**] was
under the impression her bag would be changed for her on a
regular basis. She was assigned a visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with
ostomy and wound care upon discharge.
.
Her pain was moderately well-controlled. She was using a PCA for
the intial 3 days on the floor but had difficulty understanding
how to use it; hence, her pain levels ranged from minimal to
extremely high. She was then switched on to IV morphine PRN, and
her pain was controlled better.
.
On [**7-26**], Ms [**Known lastname 43251**] began to complain of abdominal pain and
there was slight evidence of cellulitis at her midline incision.
She was started on Ancef, and the following day, three staples
were removed to drain a potential seroma. Upon opening the
wound, no fluid was drained and no seroma to be found. The wound
was packed with iodoform and changed twice daily from then on
(wet to dry). Ms [**Known lastname 43251**] stated her pain did decrease with this
opening. A swab was taken from the wound.
.
Ms [**Known lastname 43251**] complained of continous vaginal discharge, which the
GYN service believed would decrease with time. She was given
pads and mesh underwear upon discharge to [**Known lastname **] with this
discharge.
