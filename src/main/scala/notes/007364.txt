1. No evidence of focal fluid collections to suggest abscess.
2. No evidence of pneumonia.
3. GJ tube in place.

[**3-26**] Portable abdomen -
Contrast injection was performed by technologist. Exam is
limited secondary to patient positioning. A tube is extending
from patient's right with apparent tip overlying the right
abdomen. Contrast is seen over the right abdomen in a pattern
suggesting small bowel.


Brief Hospital Course:
29 yof with cerebral palsy and h/o recurrent aspiration
pneumonia admitted with tachypnea and increased wbc.
.
#  Respiratory Failure - Patient with chronic trach and history
of recurrent pseudomonas pneumonias.  Initially held of on
antimicrobials for PNA, however soon after admission she was
noted to have increased productive secretions and continued
elevated WBC she was started on aztreonam and tobramycin for
aspiration pneumonia.  Pseudomonas from sputum culture was
sensitive to tobramycin and aztreonam was discontinued.  She was
also maintained on AC mechanical ventilation.
.
#  Bactremia - Patient had 1/4 bottles blood culture with
Enterococcus and coag negative Staph.  She was started on
Vancomycin.  She was switched over to linezolid because the
enteroccus was resistent to vancomycin.  Given history of poor
access PICC line was left in place and serial blood cultures
were drawn which showed no growth by the time of discharge.  She
should get 5 more days of linezolid.
.
#  J tube malfunction - Patient had a seperate J tube and a G
tube, since her last admission she's had difficulty with
drainage around the J tube site. Surgery was consulted who
replaced a 14F foley catheter in the Jtube site and sutured the
tract close, however patient continued to have drainage from the
site.  An ostomy bag was placed over the j tube for drainage
collection.  J tube floro study did not reveal any extravasation
of contrast.  Tube feeds were attempted however she had
increased drainage and the plan is to maintain patient on TPN
and let the tract close overtime.
..
#  h/o seizure disorder - Given malfunctional J tube she was
switched to IV valium and phenobarb.   Keppra and Topamax were
held.
..
#  h/o anemia - baseline anemia - had one hematocrit of 19 and
she received one unit of prbc, thereafter hematocrit remained
stable.
.
#  FEN- initially TFs held.  Per surgery TFs were slowly started
however given increased ostomy output TFs were decreased to
10cc/hr.  She should be maintained on this, however if she has
skin breakdown around the J tube stie TFs should be held and she
should be continued on TPN only for nutritin.
