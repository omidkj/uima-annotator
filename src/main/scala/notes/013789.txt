Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH with hypotension, leukocytosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement and removal of central venous access
debridement of sacral ulcers


History of Present Illness:
59yoM with h/o Afib, HTN, s/p right hip replacement c/b right
hip osteomyelitis, colostomy, who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**]
with complaints of "dehydration," and was found to by
hypotensive and with a leukocytosis.  He was also noted to have
an ARF and anemia (Hct 20), and coagulopathic.  He was given a
dose of Vancomycin and Zosyn, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Baseline Hct [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital 46**] Hosp 2.0.  Baseline Hct 27.
.
Per reports from the patient and his son, the patient has been
bed bound x2-3yrs secondary to a failed right hip fracture c/b
osteomyelitis.  He developed two large sacral/peroneal decubitus
ulcers which eventually requireda diverting colostomy to
encourage healing.  He continues to suffer from depression and
non-healing ulcers despite multiple courses of antibiotics.
.
In the ED he was still hypotensive to 70s/30s, received 5L NS
and had a negative head CT, and was admitted to the MICU.  In
the MICU he was treated with continued iv fluids.  He was
continued initially on Zosyn and Vanco.  Blood culture results
from [**Hospital3 3583**] returned showing gram negative rods.
Antiobiotics were changed on [**2109-4-2**] to Zosyn and Levofloxacin
for double gram negative coverage.  Speciation showed it to be
Proteus, sensitivities still pending.  CT of the chest, abdomen,
and pelvis showed bilateral opacities concerning for pneumonia
or aspiration, and a sacral ulcer with concern for
osteomyelitis.  A cortisol stimulation test was done; the
results were within normal range.  The patient was sent for MRI
of the right hip; results now pending.  Blood cultures since
[**2109-4-1**] at [**Hospital1 18**] have been no growth to date. Echo [**2109-4-2**] showed
dilated RA, mild LVH, nml EF (>65%), mild AS, moderate AR.  No
vegetations were seen, but could not be excluded by this study.

.
On presentation tonight he denies current fevers, chills,
sweats, headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal
pain, nausea, dysuria, or skin changes.  He complains of
continued back pain.  He states that all of the above symptoms
have bothered him at some point over the past few days, but he
had no current complaints other than back pain.

Pertinent Results:
[**2109-4-1**] Head CT:  No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.

[**2109-4-1**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1)  Patchy centrilobular opacities at both lung bases,
consistent with an
infectious process or aspiration.
2)  Deep gluteal ulcer extending to the sacrum, which is
concerning for
osteomyelitis. Sacrum is suboptimally evaluated, and MRI or bone
scan is
recommended. Mild inflammatory changes posterior to the rectum
without
evidence of an abscess.
3)  Enlargement of the left adrenal gland with possible adenoma.

4)  Probable cyst in the left kidney.  Further characterization
by ultrasound is recommended.
5)  Dysplastic right femoral head and acetabulum. Advanced
degenerative
changes in the left hip.


Brief Hospital Course:
59yoM with history of atrial fibrillatin, osteomyelitis, and
chronic sacral decubitus ulcer, transferred from outside
hospital with sepsis secondary to GNR bacteremia.  During his
hospitalization, the following problems were addressed:
1.  Sepsis:  the patient presented in sepsis and was admitted to
the MICU where he was given aggressive iv fluid and treated with
Zosyn and vancomycin. Blood cultures at the OSH grew gram
negative rods, and antibiotics were changed to Zosyn and
levofloxacin.  He stabilized hemodynamically and was transferred
to the floor.  Speciation of the blood cultures at the outside
hospital showed Proteus that was sensitive to levofloxacin.  The
Zosyn was stopped, and he was continued on po levofloxacin.  He
had no positive blood cultures at [**Hospital1 18**].  Urinaralysis and urine
cultures were negative.  His decubitus ulcers were swabbed and
cultures sent.  These too grew pansensitve Proteus, and this was
thought to be the source of his bactermia.  CXR and chest CT
also showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates concerning for
pneumonia.  Initially he required supplemental O2 by nasal
canula. He remained afebrile and was weaned off oxygen while
continuing on the levofloxacin.  Transthoracic echo showed no
vegetations.  MRI of the pelvis and right hip was concerning for
osteomyelitis.  Infectious disease service was consulted and
recommended six week of antibiotics.  Plastic surgery was
consulted.  They performed bedside debridement of the ulcersThey
recommended continued [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes of his wounds with
wet to dry dressings and supportive care.  He received QID
fingersticks.  With the exception of two blood glucose
measurements in the 170s at noontime, blood sugars remained
within normal range, and fingersticks were discontinued.  He did
not require insulin to maintain good glucose control.  He was
given folate, zinc, and vitamins A, C, and E to provide
nutritional support for wound healing.  On the day prior to
discharge, culture results from the sacral ulcers grew sparse
pansensitive Proteus and VRE.  ID service was consulted and
recommended a two week course of Linezolid 600mg [**Hospital1 **].  He will
require an additionally 5 weeks of Levofloxacin 500mg po daily.
He should have twice weekly CBC and creatinine levels checked
while on Linezolid.  Results can be faxed to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11382**]
in Infectious Disease at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].
2.  Decubitus ulcers:  the patient has chronic ulcers.  Plastic
surgery and wound care services were consulted.  They initially
did not feel he was a candidate for VAC. It was recommended he
continue with supportive care.  They later determined that he
should have a VAC placed on the sacral and perineal ulcers.
There is no evidence of osteomyelitis on the MRI.  Despite this
he will be treated for 6weeks as precaution treatment for osteo.
 He should have [**Hospital1 **] wet to dry dressing changes with narcotics
pretreatment for pain control until the VAC is placed.  VAC to
be changed every 3 days.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
Plastic surgery for further care of these wounds.
3.  Atrial fibrillation:  patient has a longstanding history of
Afib.  When he presented to the intensive care unit he had a
coagulopathy.  This was reversed with Vitamin K, and his INR
normalized.  He was not previously on any rate control
medications, but has continued to be bradycardic to normocardic
with heart rate 38-80.  He was monitored on telemetry.
Metoprolol was not started given that he was hypotensive and d
