PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission
temperature was 96.4, pulse 88, blood pressure of 132/64,
oxygen saturation 100% on room air and 98% on ambulation.  In
general, lethargic.  Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
revealed the right eye deviated to the right.  Chest had fine
crackles on the left.  Heart had a regular rate and rhythm.
A 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex.  The abdomen was
distended, dull flanks, nontender.  Extremities revealed no
edema.  Neurologically, positive for asterixis.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On admission white blood
cell count was 12.2, hemoglobin 12.9, hematocrit 36.7,
platelets 120.  Differential of 88% neutrophils, 6.3%
lymphocytes.  PT 14.5, PTT 37.8, INR of 1.5.  Chem-7 revealed
sodium of 115, potassium 5.3, chloride 86, bicarbonate 19,
blood urea nitrogen 24, creatinine 0.9, glucose of 115.  ALT
of 161, AST 232, alkaline phosphatase 179, total
bilirubin 3.3, albumin 2.7.  Serum toxicology screen was
negative.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest CT revealed diffuse infiltrates,
left greater than right, of unclear etiology.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's very poor prognosis
with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and cirrhosis, he
elected to make himself do not resuscitate/do not intubate.

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  It was unclear what the source of
his respiratory, if any, was.  He was started on levofloxacin
as well as empiric antibiotics for Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia coverage.  He had sputum tested for acid-fast
bacillus.  Two sputum samples were negative for acid-fast
bacillus by smear and also by culture at the time of death.
He received a bronchoscopy, and the lavage fluid was negative
for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  He has a history of gastrointestinal
bleeding for esophageal varices, and was therefore started on
Protonix for prophylaxis as well as Octreotide for
prophylaxis.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  He was profoundly hyponatremic
throughout the entire hospital stay.  This was felt due both
to syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic
hormone and also to cirrhosis.  He was fluid restricted and
given albumin, as well as 3% normal saline in attempts to
increase his intravascular fluid and correct his
hyponatremia, but the hyponatremia did not resolve, and he
was persistently in the 110 range to 115 range for his
sodium.

4.  PULMONARY:  He continued to complain of frequency
coughing requiring nebulizer treatments every two hours.

On the morning of [**2104-11-17**], he was noted to become
bradycardic/systolic and then asystolic on his cardiac
monitor.  Time of death was [**2104-11-17**] at 9 o'clock
a.m.
