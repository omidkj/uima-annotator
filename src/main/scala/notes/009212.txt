PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs reveal a
temperature 99.1, pulse 105, blood pressure 233/97,
respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 90% on room air.  In
general the patient was alert and oriented times three in
mild discomfort.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination shows pupils equally round and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles intact with moist mucous membranes.
There is no lymphadenopathy and no neck tenderness.  The
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular,
tachycardiac, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen, soft,
nontender, nondistended with good bowel sounds.  There is no
organomegaly, no rebound or guarding.  Neurological
examination shows cranial nerves II through XII intact.  The
patient has no sensation to light touch below the thighs on
both lower extremities, and below the elbows in both upper
extremities.  She has 4 out of 5 muscle strength in the lower
extremities, 4+/5 muscle strength in the upper extremities.
Extremity examination, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
pulses were not palpable bilaterally.  On the left heel there
is a superficial ulceration on the medial aspect. On the
right lower extremity there is a superficial closed
ulceration of the second toe.  The lateral malleolus had a
superficial ulceration with fibrotic center and mild serous
drainage.  There is no pus or purulence.  There is no exposed
base.  There is no tracking of the wound.  There is warmth of
the lower extremities.  There is a descending cellulitis on
the right side to the mid anterior shaft, no calf vein, mild
tenderness directly adjacent to the ulceration of the lateral
malleolus.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 13.1,
hematocrit 35.5, platelets 236.  Coagulation screen shows PT
of 19.5, INR 2.5.  Chem-7 within normal limits except for
glucose of 263.  The patient's creatinine is 1.0 which is her
baseline.  Lactate is normal.  Magnesium is 1.5, calcium and
phosphorus are normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  (By issue)  1.  Right lower extremity
cellulitis and ulcerations - The patient was admitted to the
Podiatry Service on [**3-10**] for the cellulitis of the right
lower extremity.  On admission she was started on Vancomycin,
Levaquin and Flagyl for broad coverage.  Blood cultures and
wound cultures were taken.  Both grew out Escherichia coli.
In order to more specifically cover, the patient's
antibiotics were changed to Oxacillin and Ceftriaxone.  The
patient has also had hardware in her right ankle and because
of the possibility that this was seated, the patient required
surgery.  Her Coumadin was discontinued and once her INR had
decreased close to baseline, she was taken to the Operating
Room for hardware removal.  This was done on [**3-18**].
Postoperatively the patient is stable on Oxacillin and
Ceftriaxone until two days after the operation.  Then due to
concern for pneumonia her antibiotic coverage was changed to
Zosyn and Vancomycin.  She continued this for three days and
then was only on Zosyn.  Her right lower extremity was in a
vacuum-assisted closure dressing and continued to improve,
healing by secondary intention.  She has been followed by
Podiatry.  Her left lower extremity ulcer also continued to
improve.  X-rays showed an old fracture without any changes
in the left foot.  The patient did not have any further signs
of worsening cellulitis or infection of her extremities.

2.  Respiratory - On [**3-20**], the patient developed hypoxia
with an oxygen saturation of 80% on room air and hypertension
with systolic blood pressure in the 190s.  She was also
complaining of a new productive cough.  Chest x-ray done on
that day was consistent with congestive heart failure and the
patient was given Lasix.  There is also question of a right
lower lobe infiltrate on the chest x-ray, so Azithromycin was
initially added to her regimen of Ceftriaxone and Oxacillin.
On the same day, the patient also developed mental status
changes which was possibly thought to be related to her
hypoxia.  At this point, due to concern for pneumonia and
respiratory compromise, the patient's antibiotic coverage was
changed to Vancomycin and Zosyn and she was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring.  She was never
intubated.  She was continued on Zosyn and Vancomycin and a
sputum culture was obtained.  The sputum culture showed
[**Female First Name (un) 564**] and did not grow out any bacteria.  The patient's
respiratory status improved with decrease in oxygen
requirements.  Once the sputum culture was negative for any
bacteria and there was no evidence of Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus her Vancomycin was discontinued.  She
was continued on Zosyn for treatment of possible aspiration
pneumonia and for her cellulitis.

3.  Congestive heart failure - The patient required Lasix
intermittently for mild hypoxia and crackles on lung
examination indicative of congestive heart failure.  She was
also on Zestril 20 mg b.i.d. initially and then titrated up
for afterload reduction.  Her blood pressure was labile but
was controlled with Catapres, Lopressor, and Zestril.

4.  Anticoagulation - The patient's Coumadin was discontinued
as was previously mentioned in order to be taken to the
Operating Room.  While off Coumadin the patient was on a
heparin drip for her history of deep vein thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism.  Once it was decided that no further
procedures would be done by Podiatry she was restarted on
Coumadin.  Her heparin drip was continued until her INR would
be in the goal range of 2 to 3.

5.  Chronic back pain - The patient had chronic back for
which she had been on Nubain at home.  While in the hospital
she was started on a morphine PCA.  Initially there was no
basal rate, however, the patient was not using the PCA and
therefore basal rate was added.  Plan was for the patient to
have a morphine placed by Neurosurgery once her active acute
issues are cleared.  This will probably be done after
discharge.  Sh
