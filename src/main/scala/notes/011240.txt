History of Present Illness:
67 year old male with relapsed AML on chemo who presents with
fatigue and weakness.

He was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 86908**]/11 with febrile neutropenia.
At that time, he was treated for multifocal pneumonia with a
course of vanc/meropenem, and it was ultimately felt that he had
aspergillosis and was started on voriconazole.  He was also
discharged on a 7 day course of cipro.  Also had a recent
admission for strep viridens and E Coli bacteremia.

He had been feeling well at home until 2 days ago.  He was seen
in onc clinic at that time and had a low grade fever that
self-resolved.  Then started to feel chills the next day and
decided to come in for evaluation.  Denies cough, SOB, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, and headache

In the ED, he triggered for tachycardia with rate 156 on
arrival, temp 103.5.  He was rigoring and very warm to the
touch. Denied nuchal rigidity.  Labs were significant for WBC
1.3 with 88% blasts, platelets 17, and elevated LFTs.  Lactate
2.0.  CXR showed irregular density in the superior aspect of the
RLL, increased compared to prior, concerning for worsening
infectious process.  He was given vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin,
and acetaminophen.  RUQ ultrasound was normal.  BP was in the
80's after 2L IVF and right IJ CVL was placed.  Levophed was
then started, and subsequently neosynephrine was added for
refractory hypotension.  Shock ultrasound showed a trace
pericardial effusion.  CVP was measured to be 12.  BP now 93/56
and close to being maxed out on neo.  Did get stress dose
steroids in ED.  Given 7L IV fluids total in ED.  Tachypneic in
mid 20's to 40's.  Full code.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he reports feeling very discouraged and
fatigued.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest
pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in

IMAGING:

[**8-6**] CXR: Increasing conspicuous irregular opacity of right
lower lobe,
likely represents worsening infectious process though cannot
exclude
malignancy. Strongly advise imaging to resolution.

[**8-7**] RUQ US:
Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound, except for simple right
renal cyst.

[**8-7**] CT chest/abd/pelvis:
1. Progression of pulmonary opacities in bilateral lower lobes
of the lungs with non-enhancing wedge like opacity in the right
lung, and nodular opacities in the right upper lobe likely
inflammatory or infectious in nature. Associated likely reactive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
2. No acute intrabdominal process.
3. Mild periportal edema suggesting third spacing.
3. Bilateral cortical and parapelvic renal cysts.
4. Splenomegaly.
5. Lumbar spine and left hip DJD.

[**8-8**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

[**8-8**] Hip xray: 1. No evidence of joint effusion.
2. Right total hip arthroplasty without hardware complications.
3. Left hip degenerative changes.

[**8-8**] Knee xray:
Left total knee arthroplasty without hardware complications.
Small suprapatellar effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 67 year old male with
relapsed AML on chemo who presented with septic shock from
multiple organisms and who passed away in the MICU.

#. Septic Shock/Neutropenic Fever: The patient had positive
blood cultures with E. coli as well as VRE. He also appeared to
have a severe pulmonary process which was thought to be a
progression of his recent pulmonary aspergillosis. He was
treated
