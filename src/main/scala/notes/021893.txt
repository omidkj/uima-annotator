Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
anterior STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with placement of BMS x 2 to mid-LAD

History of Present Illness:
78 M with history of CAD s/p BMS to LAD in [**2111**] presenting from
[**Hospital3 3583**] with STEMI.

Mr [**Known lastname 18691**] reports that he was in his usual state of health
until the night of admission, when he developed sudden back pain
and a feeling of "being squeezed by two linebackers" when he
woke up to use the bathroom. (+) Diaphoresis, nausea, no syncope
or light-headedness. This pain was then associated with right
arm tingling, all the same as his presenting symptoms in [**2111**].
He has not had any anginal episodes since his last stent
placement 12 years ago.

At [**Hospital1 46**], patient was initially treated as NSTEMI then
developed into anterior STEMI. Started on heparing gtt,
integrillin gtt and given ASA and Plavix. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**],
in cath lab found to have TO RCA, unable to cross with wire and
felt to be chronic given the lack of ECG changes to the inferior
segment. Had tight LAD which was stented with 2 BMS with
restoration of good flow. Of note he developed a large groin
hematoma after femoral puncture with extravasation of contrast
under fluoro; femoral stop placed with successful cessation of
oozing. Transferred to CCU for further management.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Hhe denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Of note, patient has
dental procedures scheduled in the near future. Also, he has
develped a rash in his back for which he was started on
Prednisone 60mg daily for approximately one week. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

STUDIES:
[**11-13**] Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
two
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a <50% distal
stenosis. The
LAD had mild ostial disease with a proximal stent which was
widely
patent. There was a 95% stenosis in the mid LAD after D1 with
slightly
decreased flow. The LCx had a 50% ostial lesion. The RCA was
totally
occluded proximally  with extensive left to right collaterals
from the
LAD.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
systolic and diastolic blood pressure with an SBP of 120 mmHg
and a DBP
of 70 mmHg.
3. Femoral angiography performed for development of hematoma at
the
femoral puncture site revealed contrast extravasation at the
puncture
site. Integrilin was stopped, sheath was pulled, and a Femstop
was
applied with good hemostasis.
4. Unsuccessful attempt to wire the RCA.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with overlapping
2.5 x
18mm Mini Vision bare metal stents which were postdilated to
2.5mm.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.  (see PTCA comments for
details)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Right inguinal hematoma from femoral puncture site controlled
with
Femstop.
3. Unsuccessful attempt to wire the RCA.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 M with CAD with prior LAD [**Hospital 18692**] transferred from outside
hospital with anterior STEMI for emergent cardiac catheterizaton

1. CORONARIES: Transferred from outside hospital for emergent
catheterization which showed 2 vessel disease with presumed
chronically occluded RCA and mid 95% stenosis in the LAD with
TIMI 2 flow. Placed BMS x 2 on LAD.  Cardiac enzymes were
trended peaking until CK-MB peaked at 11.  Continued on ASA 325
mg, atorvostatin 80mg daily and started on a low dose of
B-blocker.  Patient was also started on plavix 75mg which he
will need to continue for at least one month following placement
of stents.  Remained chest pain free without other signs of
ischemia for the remainder of hospital course.

2. PUMP: Despite occlusion of RCA and new anterior MI, patient
had no evidence of systolic dysfunction or heart failure on
cardiac catheterization or physical exam.  Echo showed mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
basal to mid inferior hypokinesis AND distal septal/apical
akinesis; EF 40%.  As above, emphasis placed risk factor
modification with optimization of blood pressure and cholesterol
management.  Will require an outpatient Echo 4-6 months
following hospitalization.

3. RHYTHM:  Sinus rhythm, started on metoprolol.

4. Right groin hematoma: Following cardiac catheterization,
patient developed a right groin hematoma conservatively managed
by a fem stop. Fem stop was discontinued and there was no
further enlargement of hematoma.

5. Hyperlipidemia: per history not optimally controlled,
regardless required high dose statin in peri-stemi period so
started on atorvostatin 80mg.

6.  Rash: Admitted with maculopapular rash thought to be caused
by psoriasis.  Upon admission, prednisone was discontinued
because although no randomized trial data is available to
support increased cardiovascular risk of corticosteroids,
observational data would suggest
