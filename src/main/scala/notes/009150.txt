Imaging:
[**2112-7-28**] - CXR - Moderate pulmonary edema.

[**2112-7-29**] TTE - There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe inferior,
inferolateral and lateral hypokinesis (LCx distribution), as
well as hypokinesis of the anterior septum (LAD distribution).
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen, secondary
to posteromedial papillary muscle dysfunction. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with history of CAD s/p MI, diabetes mellitus
type 2, and dementia who presented with shortness of breath and
found to have an inferior ST-elevation MI that was managed
medically in keeping with his goals of care.

# Inferior STEMI:
Following the patient's overall goals of care, pt was managed
medically with ASA 325mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily, Atorvastatin
80mg daily, and Metoprolol 12.5mg twice a day.  He was also
started on Lisinopril 10mg daily.  He was given a follow-up
appointment with cardiology.

# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:
The patient was diuresed with Lasix as needed to maintain
euvolemia. CXR during admission showed interstitial markings
consistent with pulmonary edema and a left pleural effusion.
ECHO performed showed moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction (c/w multivessel CAD), mild aortic
regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary
hypertension. LVEF was 30%.  On date of discharge, pt was
clinically stable and CXR showed pulmonary status had improved
significantly.

# Episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia:
During stay, patient had runs of NSVT, which are to be expected
following acute myocardial infarction.  Pt was not treated with
antiarrhythmics, and was monitored on telemetry.  Rhythm
remained in sinus for remainder of hospitalization.

# Anemia:
Patient was noted to have a drop in his hematocrit.  His stools
remained guaiac negative, and he was hemodynamically stable.
Baseline Hct appears to be around 30, but not frankly
microcytic.  Outpatient follow-up is recommended.

# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
Patient was controlled on Lantus and insulin sliding scale
during the majority of stay.  His home oral medications,
Pioglitazone and Metformin, were re-started toward end of stay.

# Dispo: The patient was discharged in stable condition to
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
