Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress/hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
41F with no PMH who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] [**10-29**] c/o high
spiking fevers (104 tmax)and joint pain, achyness, rigors, no
swelling.  She c/o frontal HA not relieved by tylenol and
motrin.  Eventually she became overwhelmed with cough, weakness,
and fatigue and presented to [**Location (un) 620**] ED.  She also c/o corryza,
increased mucousy phlegm and DOE.  She had poor PO intake.  ROS
was positive for 10lb weight loss. She denied rashes, travel.
.
Outpatient lyme and flu were sent and were negative. She did not
have a flu shot this year or ever.
.
In the [**Location (un) 620**] ER, initial vital signs were 103.1, 100, 108/70,
18 and 95% room air.  She received 5 liters of normal saline
with approximately 500 mL of urine output.  CXR was performed
and revealed an RLL and she received Robitussin AC and Levaquin
750 mg IV. While in the ER, her saturation dropped to 91% on
room air and with supplemental 2 liters of oxygen it came up to
96%.  Initial laboratory eval was notable for pancytopenia, with
18% bands and 65% neutrophils.  ESR was 14, CRP was 108.  She
was started on Ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
.
.
Hospital course:  CT chest was performed revealing extensive
dense consolidation predominantly involving the right lower lobe
and in decreasing order of severity at the left lower lobe, and
left upper lobe.  Essentially multifocal pneumonia without lung
abscess  and no PE.  Suggestion of pulmonary arterial
hypertension.  Oxygen requirements never exceded 6L to maintain
95%.
.
Blood cultures from the ER eventually returned 3/4 bottles Staph
Epi, pan sensitive which cleared on HD#2.  No further
surveilance cultures were performed.  She is being treated with
vancomycin for this.  ID recomended echocardiogram which is
being preliminarily read as ?mitral valve endocarditis.
.
On the day of transfer creatinine was noted to be 2.4 from 0.7 3
days after CTA and RTC ibuprofen.  Per report urine output
remained "good."
.

TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the incisors. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve or chordae. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal valve morphology without echo evidence of
discrete vegetation/abscess or pathology flow.

CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of
the
pre-existing pleural effusions has slightly decreased but
parenchymal
opacities with air bronchograms are still visible at both lung
bases.
Moderate areas of atelectasis at both lung bases. The patient
has been
extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed, explaining
in part for
the slightly lower lung volumes. Unchanged size of the cardiac
silhouette.
