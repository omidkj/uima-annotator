Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Prednisone / Cortisone

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for episode of neurologic deficit

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of right carotid stent

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83yo gentleman with h/o CAD, "ischemic and
valvular" cardiomyopathy with EF 15-20%, s/p BiV pacer without
ICD, paroxysmal AFib not on coumadin admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with subacute left-sided weakness and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] after episode of transient L upper extremity weakness and
dysarthria after using the commode.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with complaints
of weakness. He was found to have a digoxin level of 3.8, and
his digoxin was held. On the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 **], he
experienced transient dysarthria and left arm weakness after
using the commode. He was transferred to the neurology service
at [**Hospital1 18**]. His initial event was felt to be vagally mediated, and
the neurology service was further investigating whether the
patient would benefit from intervention of his known carotid
artery stenosis. He had been evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 958**] of
[**2133**] and intervention was deferred in light of his multiple
co-morbidities.

During the patient's work-up, he had a similar episode on [**5-26**]
when he was on the commode and developed transient left-sided
weakness, at which point it was decided to pursue carotid stent.

suggest that the patient has equal pupils, according to Neuro
note from [**2134-1-16**] in OMR: "Left pupil 4 to 2mm and brisk. R
pupil 5-->3mm (surgical)," which is similar to current exam.

EKG demonstrated AV paced rhythm at 60 with no significant
change compared with prior dated [**2134-5-5**]. Upon arrival to the
CCU, EKG demonstrated regular wide complex tachycardia with LBBB
pattern, no visible pacing spikes. EKG from [**2-/2130**] (prior to
PPM) demonstrates LBBB with same morphology. Repeat EKG
demonstrated rate of 112 with same QRS morphology and visible
pacing spikes.

TELEMETRY demonstrated: Regular wide complex tachycardia at
about 100.
