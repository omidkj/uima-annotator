HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year old gentleman
with coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2153**], a long history of congestive heart
failure (ejection fraction less than 20%). He was last
admitted in [**2158-2-16**], for cellulitis and noted to have
fluid overload, requiring increasing doses of Lasix. Blood
urea nitrogen/creatinine increased to 140/3.7 but creatinine
returned to baseline after Cozaar was held and Foley was
placed.  He was discharged to the TCU where his weight
gradually increased from 151 pounds on [**2158-3-1**], to 165
pounds on [**2158-3-17**], despite increasing Lasix doses with
positive fluid balance and increasing creatinine from 1.9 on
[**2158-3-9**], to 4.2 on [**2158-3-17**].  He has chronic orthopnea,
dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity swelling which has
severely worsened over the past several days prior to
admission.  He denied chest pain, palpitations,
light-headedness, fever or chills.  Of note, he completed
fourteen days of Vancomycin and five days of Gentamicin from
[**2158-3-9**], to [**2158-3-14**], for recurrent highly resistant E. coli
urinary tract infection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease for which the patient had a
    coronary artery bypass graft in [**2143**].  He had a left
    internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
    and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and
    saphenous vein graft to the OM. These grafts were found
    to be patent in [**2154**].
2.  Congestive heart failure times eight years and ejection
    fraction less than 20% noted [**2157-12-15**].
3.  Mitral regurgitation, moderate.
4.  Diabetes mellitus type II times forty years with
    triopathy.
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine of 2.0
    to 3.0.
6.  Atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia.
7.  Sick sinus syndrome, status post DDD pacer.
8.  History of ventricular fibrillation arrest.
9.  Hypertension.
10. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
11. Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
12. History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
    positive anal swab in [**2157-2-15**].
13. History of right foot cellulitis.
14. History of anemia and thrombocytopenia.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, question if the patient has a
reaction.  Had a fever in the setting of being given Tetanus
boost and Penicillin.  Also by history, states allergy to
Sulfa, Minipress, Procainamide, Mexiletine.  All these have
unknown reactions.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed blood pressure
140/70, pulse 66, respiratory rate 20, temperature 96.5,
oxygen saturation 96% in room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.
Moist mucous membranes.  The oropharynx is clear.  Anicteric.
Neck - 12.0 centimeter jugular venous pressure, supple, no
bruits, no lymphadenopathy.  Heart regular rate and rhythm,
no murmurs, gallops or rubs, S3 was appreciated.  Lungs -
bibasilar rales, dullness one third the way up bilaterally.
Extremities 4+ pitting edema to the thighs bilaterally.
Genitourinary - Marked scrotal edema.  Neurological
examination alert and oriented times three, no gross motor
deficits.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.
Nonfocal examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.1, hematocrit
11.7, platelets 136, INR 1.8.  Sodium 131, potassium 4.3,
chloride 92, bicarbonate 24, blood urea nitrogen 130,
creatinine 4.2, albumin 3.3.  Creatinine kinase enzymes were
the following:  79, then 97, then 92.

[**Year (4 digits) **] on [**2158-3-17**], showed an ejection fraction of
20%, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis, right ventricle markedly
dilated, severe global right ventricular hypokinesis, right
ventricular volume overload, moderate mitral regurgitation,
severe tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary
hypertension, no pericardial effusions. There were no changes
from a previous [**Date Range 461**] on [**2157-12-15**].
Electrocardiogram showed AV paced at 64 beats per minute.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular, congestive heart failure - The patient
was admitted with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy,
biventricular congestive heart failure, and profound azotemia
secondary to poor cardiac output.  Initially, he was placed
on a Lasix drip with Zaroxolyn to promote aggressive
diuresis.  He was also continued on Hydralazine for afterload
reduction with nitrates.  However, both the Lasix drip and
then Bumex infusions were ineffective.  He was then
transferred to the CCU for a Dobutamine trial off nitrates
and Hydralazine, but this intervention too was unsuccessful.
He was oliguric, and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
continued to rise.  He therefore underwent four episodes of
dialysis which he tolerated well without hemodynamic
instability.  His congestive heart failure became far more
compensated, his breathing significantly improved, no longer
having orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  His rales
and peripheral edema markedly decreased and his oxygen
saturation remained in the 90s at room air.  Afterload
reduction was resumed with Captopril which was switched to
Lisinopril prior to discharge, and his outpatient Digoxin was
also resumed for his profoundly decreased ejection fraction
and history of atrial fibrillation.

2.  Cardiovascular, rate and rhythm - The patient remained AV
paced while on his outpatient dose of Amiodarone.  Doctor
[**First Name (Titles) 73**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] the telemetry readings and noted no
significant episodes of atrial tachycardia which the patient
has had a history of in the past.

3.  Renal - It was felt that the patient had a predominant
prerenal azotemia with a questionable component of Gentamicin
toxicity.  After failing Lasix, Bumex, then Dobutamine,
hemodialysis was started as a bridge to chronic hemodialysis
given profound fluid overload, metabolic acidosis and uremia,
all of which significantly improved once dialysis was begun.
On [**2158-3-27**], the patient had a permacath placed for long term
dialysis on a Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday schedule.  The
patient also received TUMS for hyperphosphatemia and
hypocalcemia.

4.  Infectious disease - The patient was admitted with a
recurrent E. coli urinary tract infection resistant to
Ciprofloxacin which was discontinued on admission.  While the
patient has a listed allergy to Penicillin, the family stated
he had developed a fever and diaphoresis while receiving
Penicillin and Tetanus booster concurrently.  He was
therefore started on and completed a seven day course of
Ceftriaxone without complications.  Urine culture on
[**3-25**]/.01, showed gram negative rods at 1000 colonies and
therefore no further antibiotics were given.

5.  Hematology - The patient was maintained on his Epogen.
His hematocrit was 29.2 with a MCV of 79 on discharge.  Renal
team plans to give intravenous iron for low iron state.
