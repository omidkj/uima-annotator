Admission Date:  [**2163-9-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2163-10-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2091-4-26**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old
woman with a history of HOCM, CHF, diabetes mellitus who had
been complaining of right upper quadrant pain for three
weeks.  She went to the emergency department where patient
became acutely short of breath.  CT angio shows no signs of
pulmonary embolism.  Patient was found to be in pulmonary
edema.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound on the 18th showed
echogenic parenchyma suggestive of fatty infiltration of the
liver.  No intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  Gallbladder
normal without stones or evidence of cholecystitis.

Patient was admitted where she responded to Lasix with
improvement of her respiratory status.  Patient normally is
on high doses of Lasix, Aldactone and verapamil.  Patient was
started on carvedilol.  She had an echo done on [**9-19**] which
showed normal LV systolic function, low peak LV outflow tract
gradient of 14 mm, mild LVH.  Her clinical status improved
until the night of [**2163-9-20**] when she was noted to start
getting dizzy.  Patient had massive melena and hemoptysis of
600 cc of bright red blood.

Patient was transferred to the MICU where endoscopy was
performed and showed a massive clot in the stomach mucosa
consistent with portal gastropathy.  It also showed grade 2
varices in the lower third of the esophagus.  Patient had
three endoscopies performed on the 25th.  Two bands were
successfully placed on the grade 2 varices in the lower
esophagus.  Status post banding of the esophageal varices
patient's hematocrit stabilized.  Patient had required
frequent transfusions of packed red blood cells and FFP to
maintain normal INR.  Patient's hematocrit had remained
stable and her stools progressively had less melena. She was
continued on PPI.

Hepatic failure.  Patient has long standing cryptogenic
cirrhosis leading to portal hypertension.  Patient's GI bleed
caused shock liver which led to fulminant hepatic failure.
AST and ALT rose to the thousands.  Patient had the ascites
tapped which showed SAAG greater than 1.1 consistent with
portal hypertension.  Patient's transaminases resolved in the
ensuing days after her initial hypotensive shock and her
blood pressure was maintained normal.  However, she became
encephalopathic.  She was started on lactulose for hepatic
encephalopathy and over the ensuing week showed improvement
in her mental status.  Patient was also started on nadolol
for portal hypertension.

Patient was electively intubated for airway protection.
However, she became vent dependent secondary to fluid
overload secretions and decreased central draws.  Patient
required a vent placed on [**10-7**] and increasingly required
higher PEEP in order to maintain lungs from collapsing in the
setting of increasing intra-abdominal pressure.

Infection.  Patient developed staph aureus pneumo and UTI.
She was started on clindamycin and Levaquin of which she
completed a 14 day course.

Patient gradually became hypotensive and her urine output
began to fall.  She went into renal failure.  She was boluses
normal saline, however, to third space.  Swan-Ganz catheter
was placed to assess fluid status and it was found that
patient had good cardiac output and low SVR.  Patient was
given packed red blood cells to help improve cardiac
pressure, however, her renal failure continued to worsen.  It
was felt that patient likely had hepatorenal syndrome.  She
became increasingly fluid loaded up 30 liters from admission.
It was decided that patient should be started on CVVHD to
help with fluid removal.  Patient also tolerated Lasix and
Zaroxolyn and was able to remove fluid.  She was on CVVHD,
however, her urine output dropped off even further and her
creatinine continued to rise.  CVVHD was discontinued.

Thrombocytopenia.  Platelets had fallen.  Heparin was
discontinued.  Heparin antibodies were sent off, however, it
was found that they were negative.  It was felt that
thrombocytopenia was likely secondary to hypersplenism.

On [**10-11**] patient's clinical status was discussed with
the family.  Her poor prognosis was described.  Patient's
family requested withdrawal of care and comfort measures
only.  Patient was taken off all medications.  She was put on
a morphine drip.  Patient was taken off the ventilator at
family's request.  Patient expired the evening of [**10-11**]
secondary to cardiac arrest from hypoxia.
