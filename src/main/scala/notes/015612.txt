Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2160-3-25**]

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. Mild spontaneous echo contrast in
the body of the
LA. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA.
Depressed LAA
emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) Cannot exclude LAA thrombus.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Mildly
depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in aortic
root. Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Focal calcifications
in ascending
aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Severely thickened/deformed
aortic valve
leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Trace AR. Eccentric AR jet.


MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification. No MS. Mild to moderate ([**11-27**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation. Results
were
Conclusions for
post-bypass data The post-bypass study was performed while the
patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium.
2. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in
the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s).
A left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be excluded. No atrial
septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is mildly depressed.
4. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild
global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending
aorta is
moderately dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet
is eccentric.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-27**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive
infusions including epinephrine and phenylephrine.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic
position with
normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 7 mmHg). No
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
2. LV function is slightly improved, RV function is unchanged.
3. A ascending aorta graft is seen.
4. Other finding are unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**3-24**] off coumadin and underwent AVR /replacement of
ascending and hemi-arch aorta with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] on [**3-25**].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on titrated
epinephrine and propofol drips. Extubated on POD #2 after
bronchoscopy was done for thickened secretions.  The
bronchoscopy noted tracheal malacia.  Beta blockade, aspirin and
a statin were resumed. On postoperative day three, he was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. He developed
atrial fibrillation which was treated with diltiazem and an
increase in his beta blockade. As he had chronic atrial
fibrillation, heparin in transition to coumadin was started for
longterm anticoagulation. The opthalmology service was consulted
for an injected left eye. He was placed on tobradex for five
days for conjuctivitis. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. By post-operative day ten he was ready for discharge
to home in good condition with coumadin follow-up.
