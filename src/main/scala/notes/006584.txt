Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, CVL

History of Present Illness:
51 yo F paraplegic with multiple prior admissions for PNA and
UTI complicated by sepsis presented to the ED with three days of
worsening lethargy and difficulty breathing. Her husband states
that the pt started noticing foul smelling urine and lethargy on
friday (3 days PTA). She called her PCP's Office and had a
UA/UCx done at an outside clinic--she did not start any Abx at
that time. She had no symptoms of UTI as she straight caths q4h
and has no sensation in the area at baseline. Lethargy and
productive cough worsened over the weekend until late last night
when the patient produced dark sputum and had O2 sat of 82% at
home.
.
Since her MVA in [**2143**], she has been hospitalized 15 times,
almost all of these admissions have been for UTI/PNA and many of
them have involved MICU stays. She was most recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2147-10-3**]; she was admitted for PNA and UTI,
underwent a prolonged intubation & tracheostomy & had a PEA
arrest.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98.1, HR=102, 84/49, 16, 80% room air.
She was placed on non-rebreather and given 2L NS with little
effect on her BP. RIJ CVL was placed in the ED and pt was
started on levophed. Pt was noted to be increasingly lethargic,
blood gas notable for hypercapnea & acidosis (7.14/84/151). She
was intubated in the ED. In total, she received, 7L normal
saline, levophed, nebs, zosyn, vanco, fentanyl/versed prior to
transfer to the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, BP=150/90 on a-line with HR in 80s-90s.
Levophed was weaned quickly. Initial CVP was [**11-13**] & CXR was
notable for pulmonary vascular congestion with possible focal
areas of infiltrate in the LUL and RML.
.
Review of prior Micro data revealed that during her most recent
hospitalization in [**Month (only) **] [**Numeric Identifier 66979**], her sputum grew pan-sensitive
kleb and MRSA. In [**2147-6-2**], her urine had grown [**Year (4 digits) 40097**] Kleb. UA
and UCx were obtained from the outside clinic where she had sent
urine on friday, this showed Citrobacter freundii resistant to
cefazolin and flouroquinolones, and senitive to Imipenem but
with only MIC<=4.
.
ROS: Pt unable to answer, but per her husband, she had
experienced some shoulder and neck aching, no subjective fevers
at home, no focal weakness. Had not c/o photophobia. No recent
sick contacts---they screen visitors given pt's frail health,
but she had been out in public recently and had been to MD
office visits.

Imaging:
Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
MRI Head:
FINDINGS: There are bilateral confluent areas of
hyperintensities seen in the parietooccipital lobes and a small
focus of hyperintensity is seen in the left thalamus consistent
with posterior reversible encephalopathy. No evidence of
restricted diffusion seen in these regions. There is no midline
shift or hydrocephalus. Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy is seen.
Suprasellar and craniocervical regions are normal on the
sagittal images. The vascular flow voids are maintained. Small
amount of fluid is seen in the left mastoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral parietooccipital white matter
hyperintensities also
involving [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter consistent with posterior reversible
encephalopathy. No evidence of restricted diffusion seen.



Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo F paraplegic with a hx of recurrent UTIs, PNAs, sepsis,
presenting with 3 days of UTI (with + urine culture) and
worsening productive cough/hypoxia likely representing PNA, who
developed PRES in ICU setting.
.
# PNA: Patient presented in hypoxic & hypercapneic respiratory
failure, requiring intubation in ED. CXR was notable for
pulmonary vascular congestion with possible focal areas of
infiltrate in the LUL and RML. Patient received empiric
vanco/zosyn. She briefly required levophed, which was weaned at
arrival to the MICU. Given recent hospitalization in [**Month (only) **] and
MRSA in sputum, she was treated for healthcare associated PNA,
as well as for UTI, with vancomycin, meropenema and gentamycin.
She completed a 7 day course of vanco and gent, and 14 d of
meropenem.
On [**12-25**], she was extubated, but given her sedation and
incresed work of breathing, she was reintubated.  The
possibility of a tracheostomy was raised but apparently the
patient refused.
The patient was educated about good airway clearance. She
received chest PT and was able to provide good coughing on her
own. 02 sat was 94-95% on room air at discharge.
.
#PRES:  Patient became hypertensive to the 180s in the MICU
setting and was started on IV hydralazine. On [**12-29**], she
developed a severe headache with binocular blindness and
decreased facial sensation in the setting of high blood
pressures; CT and MRI were consistent with diagnosis of PRES
syndrome.  Neurology was consulted who recommended a blood
pressure between 120 and 140.  Chlorthalidone was started and BP
remained largely within goal range, with some blood pressure in
90-100s. Headache and vision greatly improved by discharge.
Neurology recommended follow-up MRI in 2 weeks and neuro clinic,
as well as [**Hospital 2081**] clinic appointments. The patient was instructed
to continue chlorthalidone and check BP at home twice daily. Dr
