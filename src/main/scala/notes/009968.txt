SOB

[**3-12**] homograft bentall


History of Present Illness:
25 yo M with a history of
IV drug abuse with strep viridans endocarditis, bicuspid aortic
valve and new severe AI with prolonging PR interval.
.
The patient was in his usual state of health until 8 days prior
to admission when he developed palpitations, fevers,
lightheadedness and DOE with minimal activity. Three days prior
to admission he presented to [**Hospital6 302**]. Out of concern
for pneumonia, the patient was started on Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin. Subsequent evaluation for persistent and
progressive shortness of breath and orthopnea revealed signs of
volume overload. TTE at the OSH revealed aortic regurgitation
with concern for a vegetation on the aortic valve.

Brief Summary of Patient History: 25 yo M with h/o IVDA,
intranasal heroin, poor dental care who presented with fever,
sudden onset of palpitations, lightheadedness, dyspnea with mild
exertion, murmur. Treated at OSH for pneumonia and then
subsequently had an echocardiogram which revealed AI and then
TEE
which revealed moderate-sized vegetation (1.2 x 1.1 cm) on the
posterior leaflet of the aortic valve with flail leaflet. Blood
cultures on admission grew strep viridans and he was treated
with
vancomycin and gentamicin and then transitioned to ceftriaxone
and gentamicin. Subsequent blood cultures demonstrated no
growth.
On the evening of [**3-10**], he developed prolonged PR and was
transferred to the CCU and on [**3-11**], a temporary pacing lead was
placed. He underwent extraction of complete bony impaction of
multiple teeth (he had noted right inferior decayed / fractured
molar in place for several months).  On [**3-12**], he underwent
aortic
valve replacement, bentall procedure with homograft placement.
Valve tissue was sent for culture and pathology. Culture did not
demonstrate any growth.  Plan was made to continue ceftriaxone
for 4 weeks with synergistic gentamicin for the first 2 weeks
from the time of his surgery on [**3-12**].

INDICATION: Status post PICC.

COMPARISON: Multiple priors, most recent from [**2185-3-14**].

AP PORTABLE CHEST: The tip of a left PICC terminates at the
cavoatrial junction. There is a right chest wall pacemaker
generator with a single intact lead projecting over the right
atrium. Median sternotomy wires and epicardial pacer leads are
unchanged in position. Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
Pneumopericardium is again noted. A tiny right apical
pneumothorax persists. There is improving left retrocardiac
opacity consistent with resolving atelectasis. Right lower lobe
atelectasis remains stable. Small bilateral pleural effusions,
greater on the right, are without change.

IMPRESSION: Improving left basilar atelectasis. Otherwise no
significant interval change.
