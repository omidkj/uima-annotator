Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
89 year old man with hx atrial fibrillation, HTN, BPH,
bronchiectasis presenting with cough for the past week. Per
family member, he was having a worsening productive cough. He
was evaluated by his PCP who thought it was an sinus allergy and
prescribed a nasal spray. She denied his having a fever. She
denied he had chest pain or particular shortness of breath. He
had a mild headache yesterday. Today, he said to her that he did
not feel well which prompted a trip to the ED.
In the ED, his initial vital signs were notable for 98.5
(100.2rec) 178/128 22 94%4L. He subsequently stated that he had
shortness of breath. A CXR was unchanged from prior. He had
progressive respiratory fatigue and was intubated with etomidate
prior to having a CTA chest. Following intubation, he dropped
his blood pressure to 70s systolic which improved following IVF
and removal of the propofol.
.
ROS: per the patient's wife: denies chest pain, abd pain,
dysuria, back pain. no leg swelling.

.
CXR - Bilateral lower lung pleural
plaques are consistent with prior asbestos exposure. An apparent
interstitial abnormality is better evaluated on recently
performed CTA chest ([**2172-3-8**]). There is no focal airspace
consolidation or pleural effusion. The bony thorax is
unremarkable.
.
CTA chest - (wet read) No PE. Again cardiomegaly, pleural and
interstitial abnormalities c/w asbestosis exposure and mild
asbestosis.
.
CXR - (post-intubation) - Post-intubation with endotracheal tube
and orogastric tube in satisfactory position.
.
Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**11-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Severely dilated right ventricle with at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (may be underestimated as
right atrial pressures are probably elevated). Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old man with history of CAD, HTN, atrial fibrillation,
and bronchiectasis who presented dizziness to have progressive
hypoxic respiratory failure from presumed pneumonia who also
developed urinary tract infection and traumatic hematuria.
.
1 Hypoxic respiratory failure: Leading cause given low grade
fever and bandemia would be CAP although he did not have an
impressive chest xray for infection on admission. After
intubation with fluid resuscitation, the patient had bilateral
patchy infiltrates superimposed on evidence of chronic
parenchymal disease on prior films. The patient was intubated
for 4 days. He was treated with double coverage (levo/CTX) for
CAP requiring ICU admission. He was extubated and did well,
aided by one day of diuresis with lasix, but has been
auto-diuresing since.  His EKG was not significantly changed
from prior. CT was also negative for PE. He completed 5 days of
levofloxacin 750mg qdaily and 8 days of ceftriaxone 1g q24hours.
He was noted to be deconditioned after extubation and felt to
have difficulty clearing secretions so was aided with the use a
flutter valve, incentive spirometer, chest pt, regular pt,
albuterol and ipratropium nebs, and guaifenesin. He was slowly
weaned from supplemental oxygen, with sats in the low 90's on
RA.
.
2 Rising leykocytosis: After being transferred from the MICU,
the patient was noted to have a rising WBC.  After a UA came
back with moderate bacteria and >1000 WBC, a UTI was suspected
and a course of Cipro 500mg PO Q12 hours was started.  This was
later discontinued after 1 dose and a repeat UA was completely
negative. He developed loose stool and was started on empiric
Flagyl 500mg PO TID on [**2173-4-19**] out of concern for C. Difficile
(sample negative x1 on discharge; 2nd sample pending).  His
diarrhea was improving by time of discharge and his WBC had
decreased from 15k to 12k after one day of metronidazole.  He
will continue metronidazole through [**2173-5-4**].
.
3 Atrial fibrillation: Beta blocker was titrated up in MICU.
Digoxin was initially held then restarted, with level noted to
be 0.4. Aspirin 325mg was continued throughout.  He is
chronically not anticoagulated due to fall risk per Dr. [**Known lastname 1007**].
Before discharge,his BP's were running low (systolic high 90's
and low 100's) necessitating holding of the metoprolol and HCTZ.
 It was decided to decrease the metoprolol to 50mg PO BID,
closer to his initial home dose of 50mg PO daily.
.
4 Hematuria: He was noted to develop hematuria, presumably from
foley placment. Once the foley was removed he continued have
bloody urine but never became obstructed. This should be
followed up as an outpatient to determine resolution.
.
5 Dementia: Alzheimer's type per Dr. [**Known lastname 1007**]. He was continued on
donepizil. He became delerious at night in the icu but improved
with haldol/trazadone. On the floor he only needed haldol and
remained lucid with good attention.
