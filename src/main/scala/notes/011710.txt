HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old
female with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15% who
presents with chest pain and cough for a one month period.
She was previously admitted to the Coronary Care Unit in
[**2122-2-4**] for congestive heart failure secondary to
medication noncompliance.  Approximately one month ago, the
patient says she began developing productive cough with no
fevers or chills, and has been having intermittent chest pain
controlled by Ultram.  She only takes brand name medications
due to a concern for allergies to generic medications.
However, she is only able to take some of her prescribed
medications due to the cost.  She denies any lightheadedness
or dizziness, and also denies any medication noncompliance or
dietary indiscretion.  On arrival in the Emergency
Department, the patient's vital signs were a heart rate of
97, blood pressure of 120/60, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen
saturation of 96% on room air.  She had transient episodes of
hypotension to the 70's over 40's and received 500 cc of
normal saline.  She was treated with aspirin, Levaquin and
Zofran.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Postpartum cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction 15%.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.

4.  Hepatitis B.
5.  Hepatitis C.
6.  Elevated cholesterol.
7.  Gout.
8.  Asthma.
9.  Status post cholecystectomy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to penicillin, Lasix and

2.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Bumex 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Avandia 4 mg p.o. q. day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient discontinued tobacco use ten
years ago, she has a history of crack cocaine usage.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a heart
rate of 101, blood pressure 120/45, respiratory rate 16, and
oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  In general, the patient
is an extremely obese female in no apparent distress who was
very anxious an histrionic.  Head and neck examination
revealed moist mucus membranes, clear oropharynx and mildly
elevated jugular venous distention.  Lungs had bibasilar
crackles with good air movement.  Cardiac examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2, no
murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft with positive bowel
sounds and mild tenderness which has been present for one
year.  She has an ulcer measuring 1 cm x 2 cm size inferior
to her umbilicus which is clean and dry.  Extremities had 1+
lower extremity edema bilaterally with 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses.  Neurologically cranial nerves II through XII were
closely intact.

LABORATORIES:  Significant for a BUN of 51 and creatinine of
2.9.  CBC showed a white count of 4.4 with hematocrit of
32.5.  CK was 295 with an MB of 3 and troponin less than 0.3.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle
branch block which was unchanged from prior EKG.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray demonstrated stable cardiomyopathy
with indistinct pulmonary vasculature and no definite
effusion which was consistent with congestive heart failure.
It was not significantly changed from prior chest x-ray in
[**2122-2-4**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Congestive heart failure:  Patient was treated with
nesiritide and Bumex, which resulted in significant diuresis.
At no time did she require supplemental oxygen.  Arterial
line was inserted and demonstrated blood pressures ranging 90
to 100 systolic, which is the patient's baseline.  She was
treated with intravenous nesiritide for three days and
discharged home on a stable regimen of 1 mg of Bumex b.i.d.

2.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine was mildly elevated at
2.9 on admission.  With continued diuresis, her creatinine
decreased closer to a baseline of 2.3 at the time of
discharge.

3.  Chest pain:  The patient ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.  She continued to complain of intermittent chest
pain which was relieved by narcotics.  A significant portion
of her chest pain is thought to be due to anxiety.

The patient was discharged in stable condition to home with
services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Postpartum dilated cardiomyopathy.
2.  Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 15%.
3.  Diabetes.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
