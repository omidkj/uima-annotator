Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly depressed LVEF.


RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Critical AS (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) MR. [**Name13 (STitle) 15110**] to
the eccentric MR jet, its severity may be underestimated (Coanda
effect).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate to
severe [3+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

1. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is globally mildly depressed
(LVEF= 45%). However intrinsic LV systolic function may be
further impaired given the degree of MR
4. Right ventricular chamber size is moderately dilated Free
wall motion is normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending
thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2) with peak and mean
gradients 25 and 14 respectively. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
8. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen with
a dilated TV annulus 4.6cm.
9. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results
during surgery on [**2136-5-11**] at 843.

POSTBYPASS
1. Patient is on phenylephrine and epinephrine infusions.
2. A well functioning, well seated tissue valve is noted in the
mitral position. A small perivalvular leak is noted. Max
pressure gradient 27 and mean PG 9 mmHg.
3. A well functioning, well seated tissue valve is noted in the
aortic valve. A small perivalvular leak is noted along the
anterior LVOT wall. Max pressure gradient is 19 with a mean
gradient of 9 mmHg.
4. A tricuspid annuloplasty ring is noted. Residual mild
tricuspid regurgitation is noted.
5. LV EF is similar to prebypass.
6. Aortic contour is smooth after decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
