Admission Date:  [**2122-6-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2122-6-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2061-9-8**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU/ACOVE
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Increasing shortness of breath times 10 days.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old male
with a past medical history significant for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery
disease, status post myocardial infarction, with known sleep
apnea who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**6-1**] with 10 days of progressive dyspnea on exertion.

In the Emergency Department at that time, he was noted to be
in respiratory distress utilizing his accessory muscles. Arterial
blood gas indicated hypercarbic respiratory failure with a blood
gas showing pH of 7.19, PCO2 of 62, PO2 of 142.  He was treated
with Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenously, given one dose of
Levaquin, and then continuous nebulizers.  He was placed on
oxygen and did not require BiPAP at that time.  Subsequent
arterial blood gas improved to 7.29/49/118, and the patient was
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for nebulizer therapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Congestive heart failure with transthoracic
echocardiogram in [**2122-2-6**] showing decreased left
ventricular function; ejection fraction not calculated.
 2.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2118**]; likely in an inferoposterior distribution
based on transthoracic echocardiogram.
 3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with pulmonary
function tests in [**2122-2-6**] showing an FEV1 of 1.44
(or 58%), FVC of 2.72 (or 78%), FEV1:FVC ratio of 74%.
 4.  Asthma.
 5.  Question of seizure disorder in [**2118**].
 6.  Multiple hernia repairs.
 7.  Bursitis.
 8.  Gout.
 9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10.  Obstructive sleep apnea; does not utilize BiPAP.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Outpatient medications were as
follows)
1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Zestril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Singulair 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.

It was not clear which medications the patient actually
takes, as the patient is on free care and a number of these
medications are not on the free care formulary; as such, he
most likely could not obtain them.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired galvanizer.  He is
divorced.  He lives in senior living.  He does all of his own
activities of daily living.  He smoked one pack per week for
30 years; discontinuing approximately two weeks prior to
admission.  He admits to one pint of alcohol per week.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  (Admission physical
per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] was as follows)  The patient was afebrile,
pulse of 118, blood pressure of 127/82, respiratory rate
of 22, with an oxygen saturation of 100% on 100%
nonrebreather.  His head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination was unremarkable.  The admitting resident noted
jugular venous distention.  Otherwise, the neck was supple.
Carotids had slightly reduced upstroke.  No bruits were
noted.  His lungs had diffuse expiratory wheezes with poor
air movement and prolonged expiratory phase.  No crackles
were noted.  His heart was regular in rate and rhythm but
distant and difficult to auscultate.  There was a question of
third heart sound on examination.  No murmurs were
appreciated.  His abdomen was obese.  Bowel sounds were
present.  No hepatojugular reflux was noted.  His extremities
had mild pitting edema.  His distal pulses were 2+
bilaterally, and neurologic examination a nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  (Admission
laboratories were as follows)  White blood cell count of 9
(with a differential of 35 neutrophils, 0 bands,
51 lymphocytes, 9 monocytes, 5 eosinophils, 0.5 basophils),
hematocrit of 39.2, platelets of 352.  PT was 13.6, INR
was 1.3, PTT was 25.6.  Sodium of 145, potassium of 4.4,
chloride of 110, bicarbonate of 21, blood urea nitrogen of 8,
creatinine of 1.3, blood glucose of 103.  Initial creatine
kinase was noted to be elevated at 1225 but with a negative
MB index.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray was under penetrated.  The
lungs were noted to be clear.  No evidence of congestive
heart failure or infiltrate.

His electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate
of 120.  No significant changes when compared to prior.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for close observation and the
requirement of q.1h. or less nebulizer treatments.

Given that the patient had a recent admission in [**2122-2-6**], at which time he responded to diuresis, the decision was
made to diuresis the patient despite having no radiologic and
very minimal examination findings of failure.  The question of
pulmonary embolism was also raised; however, review of CT
angiogram did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism, and lower
extremity noninvasive ultrasounds were negative for deep venous
thrombosis.

With continued diuresis the patient's creatinine rose to 2.2,
and he had a FENa consistent with prerenal physiology.  As such,
further diuresis was held, and the patient was given back volume.
The patient's creatinine responded well, going down to his
baseline of 1.1.  The patient no longer required q.2h. nebulizers
by [**2122-6-6**], and was transferred to the floor at that time.

The patient continued to recover well on the floor and was
transitioned to a medication regimen that was available on the
free care formulary.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  On [**2122-6-10**], the patient was
discharged to home with outpatient Pulmonary followup.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2.  Beclovent inhaler 4 puffs b.i.d.
3.  Ipratropium inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d.
4.  Albuterol inhaler 1 to 2 puffs q.i.d. p.r.n.
5.  Prednisone taper starting at 30 mg p.o. q.d. for three
days; followed by 20 mg p.o. q.d. for three days; followed by
10 mg p.o. q.d. for three days; followed by 5 mg p.o.
thereafter.
6.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  (The patient was scheduled for the
following appointments)
1.  Pulmonary rehabilitation on Tuesday, [**2122-6-23**]
at 2:30 p.m., [**Last Name (un) 469**], [**Location (un) 1773**] (telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2484**]).
2.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital6 733**] East,
[**Last Name (un) 469**], sixth floor, on Wednesday, [**2122-6-17**] at 4 p.m.
(telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]).  At that time, it was
expected that Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] will restart the patient's
ACE inhibitor and discontinue the use of hydralazine as renal
function returns to baseline.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Asthma.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
