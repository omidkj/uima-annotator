Service:  CARDIAC

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is an
82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, as well as a history of
bradycardia with syncope.  He presented with epigastric
discomfort times three to four days, as well as increasing
low back pain and muscle pain.

Admission evaluation included admission chest film, which
showed him to be in mild CHF, as well as admission labs
showing the hematocrit of 27.5.  He is guaiac negative.  He
also had a bump in creatinine from 1 to 1.5.  The patient's
CPK and MB were 237 and 6 with the troponin of 3.7 and EKG
changes in V4 through V6 showing ST depression.  He was
admitted for evaluation of CHF and rule out MI.

The Department of Cardiology was consulted per the Medicine
Service.  The patient was reluctant to undergo cardiac
catheterization.  So, originally, he was clinically studied
with Persantine thallium.  However, after several days of
deliberation, the patient finally agreed to a cardiac
catheterization on the 25th, which showed a 90% stenosis in
the left marginal circumflex artery, as well as a tight
stenosis at the right coronary artery and 60% stenosis at the
oblique marginal OM1 artery.  He was, therefore, slated to
undergo CABG.  Cardiac surgery was consulted by the Medicine
Service.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw the patient.  He deemed him an
appropriate candidate for surgery.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on presented revealed the
following:  The patient was noted to have vital signs of
97.1, 106/63, pressure of 66, pulse of 93% on room air.  He
was cool and clammy.  Lungs had decreased breath sounds at
the bases.  He was regular rate with an S3, which was
audible.  He had 2+ edema peripherally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data was previously
stated with the hematocrit of 27.5, creatinine 1.5 up from
1.0.  The admission enzymes were previously stated.  The EKG
results were also stated.  During the hospital course, once
he was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery, he ultimately went to
the operating room for bypass on the 28th.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
performed four vessel CABG.  He utilized the left internal
mammary artery for the LED graft, as well as the saphenous
vein graft from the OM1 to D1 and RPDA.  The patient was
noted to have EF of 60% preoperatively and postoperatively.
He was extubated on the night of surgery and brought to the
Cardiac ICU, where his drips were weaned.  He was given a
diuresis with Lasix.

On postoperative day #2, he was doing well and discharged to
the floor.  He was converted to oral medications and began
ambulating.  By postoperative day #4 the chest tubes and the
Foley catheters were out.  The patient was voiding and
tolerating the diet with good pain control, afebrile.

By postoperative day #6, the patient was deemed stable and
appropriate for discharge.  Foley catheter was re-inserted
the day prior to discharge because of failure to void with
the Foley out.  He does not have a Foley at this time as it
was removed on the morning of discharge.  He is due to void
by later this afternoon.

The patient's condition on discharge is stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He will be going to a rehabilitation
facility.

DIAGNOSIS:  Acute coronary syndrome, ruling in for myocardial
infarction, three-vessel disease warranting coronary artery
bypass graft times four completed on [**2168-11-29**].

FOLLOW-UP CARE:  The patient will be seen back in the Cardiac
Clinic in one month.  He will have wound check in one to
days.  He additionally will get Percocet as needed for pain,
as well as recommendations to utilize Ibuprofen 600 mg p.o.
t.i.d. with meals.
