Echocardiogram:
Due to severely limited suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is difficult to estimate but
appears at least mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. The valvular structures are not well
visualized. There is no anterior pericardial effusion. The
remainder of the pericardium is not seen.

LE dopplers
Limited exam demonstrating normal variability and waveforms
except the left popliteal vein demonstrates limited variability
with normal augmentation. Non-occlusive thrombus in the lower
SFV or upper popliteal vein cannot be excluded in this area.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7594**] is a 28 yo male with morbid obesity and OSA admitted
on [**7-14**] with somnolence and mental status changes.  Found to be
in hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient was intubated on
[**7-15**]; he had a difficult airway and was intubated with help of
fiberoptics.

1)Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Several possible etiologies
were considered including heart failure, possible ACS or PE
(patient was apparently immobile and home for several months
prior to presentation), obesity hypoventilation and OSA.  It was
thought that his respiratory failure was most likely a
combination of several of these including OSA, obesity
hypoventilation and heart failure. Patient was intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure on [**7-15**] and ABG were consistent
with both hypercarbia and hypoxia. He was put on albuterol and
ipratropium nebs.  In terms of PE, the patient's weight excluded
him from undergoing a CTA. As a result, he was intubated and
empirically started on a heparin drip to treat presumptively for
PE.  ACS was unlikely since his troponins were <0.01. Giving
difficulties weaning him off the ventilator due to high PEEP
requirements (28)and difficulties with the initial intubation,
the possibility of tracheostomy was entertained. His respiratory
course was complicated by high PEEP requirements to 28/30.  An
esophageal balloon had been placed to measure his transpulmonary
pressures which showed that his high PEEP requirements were
appropriate for his body habitus.  On [**7-22**], he was noted to have
almost white out of [**2-9**] of his right lung.  Subsequent chest
x-rays showed mild improvement, but continued to have this
opacity.  Interventional pulmonology was consulted for
thoracentesis and possible chest tube placement for concern of
hemothorax.  The pleural fluid was consistent with hemothorax,
but chest tube was unable to be placed by IP, and thus had to be
placed by thoracic surgery.  In hopes to eventually place a
tracheostomy tube, the patient's PEEPs were attempted to be
weaned.  He initially tolerating weaning to a PEEP of 16,
however he acutely decompensated afterward with hypotension and
worsening oxygenation, and was turned back up to a PEEP of 25.
This was not an acceptable level for safe tracheostomy
placement. Mr. [**Known lastname 7594**] soon after passed away.

2)Sedation: After the patient was intubated, there were
difficulties with sedation given his body habitus. He was
initially placed on fentanyl and versed but there was concern
that these medications were being stored in his fat stores given
their pharmacokinetics. The decision was made to transition him
to Methadone; the regimen was safely created with the help of
the pharmacist. For a brief period of time the patient did well
on this regimen. As the patient's PEEP started to increase again
and the poor prognosis, the decision was made to transition him
back to Fentanyl and Versed.

3)Bleeding complications: After heparin was started empirically
for PE, the patient had several bleeding complications including
a right hemothorax, left forearm compartment syndrome, and
subcutaneous bleeding.  Heparin was immediately stopped and each
of these issues were treated appropriately (as described below).
 Hematology was consulted and they agreed with this decision.  A
work up to find a possible bleeding diathesis was performed, but
did not reveal any underlying abnormalities.

4)Right heart failure: Echo on [**7-15**] was suboptimal [**2-8**] patient's
body habitus, but showed a depressed LVEF (45-50%), and a
dilated RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis. This
evidence of R heart failure was thought to most likely explained
by OSA/obesity hypoventilation leading
