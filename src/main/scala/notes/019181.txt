Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Bleeding from colostomy and foley


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
84 year old male with multiple co-morbidities including rectal
cancer s/p resection and radiation in [**2157**] now with colostomy,
coronary artery disease s/p stents, systolic CHF, dilated
cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation not on [**Year (4 digits) **], cardiac
arrest and complete heart block s/p AICD/pacemaker, recent
trach/peg after prolonged hospitalization for rib
fractures/flail chest s/p fall who presents with large amount of
bleeding from colostomy and Foley. The patient also endorsed
increased shortness of breath, weakness and fatigue. The patient
had been recently admitted 8/21-25/[**2163**] to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for
pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia/sepsis and had been discharged on
Vancomycin and baby aspirin (for his atrial fibrillation and
coronary artery disease).
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were: Afebrile, HR70,
BP107/53, RR24, 91% on trach vent. Given his tender abdomen,
there was initial concern for an intrabdominal event.
ACS/General Surgery was consulted and CT abdomen/pelvis was
performed. As the imaging was negative, there were no acute
surgical concerns; ACS recommended tagged RBC if he continued to
bleed. GI was also consulted and recommended two units pRBC for
Hct 22, IV PPI initiation. The patient also underwent PEG lavage
which was clear but was passing small amounts of maroon colored
stools. There was also initial concern for DIC but labs not
suggestive of this (the patient has history of heparin induced
thrombocytopenia but platelets normal). The patient has had
hematuria in the past, with three-way foley in place.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient was resting comfortably in
bed with trach/PEG, endorsing fatigue and abdominal pain. Per
the patient's wife, the patient looked good on discharge two
days ago but seemed under the weather on arrival to [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab. When she saw him at 6pm yesterday evening, he was stable
without signs of bleeding.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) [**Hospital 4273**] fever, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or
wheezing. [**Hospital 4273**] chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or
weakness. [**Hospital 4273**] nausea, vomiting.

IMAGING:
[**2163-9-9**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Blunting of the left costophrenic angle and left
base opacities consistent with left pleural effusion with
overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be
entirely excluded. Cardiomegaly and prominent right hilum again
seen. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved.
.
CT ABD and PELVIS:
1. Ascites is new since most recent exams dating back to [**2161**],
likely
correlating with diffuse anasarca.
2. Slight increase in size of 9-mm enhancing left liver lobe
lesion which is incompletely characterized on this exam. This
might be a flash filling
hemangioma or focal nodular hyperplasia. No other acute
intra-abdominal
process. If more definitive characterization is desired,
multiphasic CT of
the liver could be considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
84yo M PMHx CAD s/p stenting, systolic CHF (EF40-45%), atrial
fibrillation, recent hospitalization for MRSA bacteremia of
respiratory source, who represented from MACU with hematuria and
blood in colostomy bag, thought to be secondary to recent
initiation of ASA, now resolved after holding ASA,
hemodynamically stable x multiple days, being discharged to
MACU.
.
ACTIVE
# Blood in Ostomy: Patient w/ history of UGIB secondary to
angiectasias in the duodenum who presented w/ trace blood in his
ostomy; patient remaining hemodynamically stable w/ PEG lavage
negative; Trace blood in his colostomy bag suggests lower GI
bleed; given temporal relationship to initiation of ASA, this
was felt to most likely be an exacerbation of underlying issue;
bleeding resolved with holding of ASA.  He received 2 units of
pRBC on the day of admission.  His hemoglobin/hematocrit was
thereafter stable.  Patient/family have declined scoping at this
time but may be amenable to this as an outpatient (of note,
colonoscopy in [**2160**] was normal).  Continued patient's home
omeprazole; held ASA (see below).  His cardiologist was notified
because the patient is now no longer on aspirin or [**Year (4 digits) **], but
bleeding risk strongly outweighs stroke risk at this time.
Patient will need to readdress issue of colonoscopy as an
outpatient with outpatient providers.  Scheduled follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] on [**10-31**].  Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] office to see if
can get EGD sooner.

# Hematuria: Patient with a history of hematuria of uncertain
etiology who presents w recurrence of bleeding, thought to be
secondary recent initiation of
