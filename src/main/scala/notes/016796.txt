Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 29767**]
Chief Complaint:
mental status change and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral line placement

History of Present Illness:
care on [**5-18**] to the ED with hypotension SBP 60s and change in
mental status x 1-2 days, hypoxia with O2 sats 84% on 2L NC.
Nursing home reported decreased PO intake and lethargy, fevers
low grade 99.9. Pt was started on [**5-16**] Levo/Flagyl at the NH for
RLL PNA on CXR.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile, BP initially 96/74, transiently
decreased to SBP 68/43 responsive to IVF (received 4L NS). Her
lactate was 2.3. Received Flagyl and Vancomycin in ED. Tried
briefly on dopamine but HR increased substantially so was
stopped and has not required further pressor support. Vascular
surgery evaluated pt and opened left AKA stump wound which
expressed pus and wound cultures were sent. Right femoral TLC
was placed (after arterial stick). UA was positive for UTI,
urine culture sent, also copious liquid stool present.
Transferred to MICU for further w/u of sepsis. She was
transfused one unit of blood in the ICU for a HCT of 21.
Her previous hospital course at [**Hospital1 336**]:Left AKA done at [**Hospital1 336**]
[**2142-2-23**] [**1-3**] embolic phenomon (pt has afib and was not on
anticoagulation). She was discharged to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Rehab on
[**2142-3-1**] without complications. She was then readmitted to [**Hospital1 336**]
on [**2142-3-5**] - [**2142-3-17**] with CHF and chest pain with EKG changes. At
that time, she ruled out for an MI, echo showed EF 30% (repeated
later and was 40%), 4+ TR, and elevated PAP. She underwent a
stress that showed no perfusion defects. She then developed
sepsis [**1-3**]/ MSSA PNA and was transfrred to the MICU, was on
pressors for 1 night. She was treated with oxacillin. Due to the
increased fluids she was given in the MICU, she was in
decompesated heart failure, was sloly diuresed, then discharged
to NE [**Hospital1 **] again. She was there between [**3-17**] - [**4-11**] during
which she was c.diff positive treated with Flagyl and recurrent
UTIs. Her AKA wound was slow to heal and she was repeadly seen
by vascular for debredments. She was then discharged to
[**Location (un) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 2 weeks before admission to [**Hospital1 18**].

2. Anemia - chronic disease
3. h/o C diff in [**4-5**], treated with Flagyl
4. h/o UTIs- klebsiella and VRE in [**4-5**] treated with Linezolid
5. h/o MSSA PNA causing sepsis and brief pressor support
6. h/o MRSA wound infection
7. afib - on digoxin and coumadin
8. h/o CVA 6 yrs ago
9. ?tardive dyskinesia - involuntary movements of arms on [**5-16**] -
started on benadryl
10. Phantom Limb pain and chronic LE neuropathy (started prior
to amputation)- on Fentanyl patch and neurontin
11. CHF - EF of 40%, 4+TR on echo [**3-6**]
12. GE Refulx/nausea


Social History:
She had been functioning on her own with husband until her L AKA
in [**Month (only) 958**], then has lived at NH since and required requent
hospitalizations at [**Hospital1 336**] per granddaughter. [**Name (NI) **] h/o EtOH, remote
tob use 30yrs ago, no IVDA.

Staphylococcus
      aureus and beta streptococcus).
