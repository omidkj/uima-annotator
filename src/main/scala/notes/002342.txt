Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 80848**] is a 75yo woman with h/o dementia and CHF who comes in
from her nursing home after being found hypoxic.

Per her nursing home, she was short of breath all day with O2
sats of 86% on RA.  She also complained of generalized weakness,
decreased po intake, and increased confusion per reports.  Also
had tachypnea.

She initially presented to the [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital ED with VS BP
83/45, HR 97, RR 16, T 97.4, O2 Sat 91% on 2L.  Her Hct was low
at 25 and she received 1 units of packed RBCs.  She was guaiac
negative.  CXR was felt to show LLL PNA as well as some heart
failure.  Peripheral dopamine was started for a systolic blood
pressure in the 80s.  She also received hydrocortisone 100mg IV
as well as levofloxacin, vancomycin, and imipenem for coverage
of health-care associated pneumonia in an ICU-level patient.
She also had hyperglycemia to the 400's and has no past h/o
diabetes.

Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her initial VS were:  97.6   66/53
87   86% on ?L.  She remained talkative and pleasant.  CXR
demonstrated possible b/l consolidations.  She was given 1500cc
of IV fluids and continued on a dopamine gtt.  Her guardian was
[**Name (NI) 653**], and it was agreed that placement of a central line
would be consistent with her care.  Therefore, a right IJ
catheter was placed and her pressors were transitioned to
levophed.  Her code status was confirmed with her guardian as
DNR/DNI.

Upon arrival to the ICU, she wasn't sure, but she thought she
was short of breath.  She denied headaches, chest pain, or
abdominal pain.

gas-filled bowel loops in the RUQ.  No tenderness to palpation,
no distention.
EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis on left
and 1+ on right.
SKIN: No rashes/lesions, ecchymoses.
NEURO: Alert, oriented to self only. Answers questions about
where she grew up appropriately. CN 2-12 intact. Preserved
sensation throughout. Strength is [**4-23**] in LUE and LLE.  In RUE,
distal strength appears intact but she has 4+/5 proximal
strength.  In RLE, she has difficulty raising her leg from the
bed or bending her knee from the bed but can bend her knee with
gravity.  2+ reflexes in UE that are equal BL, difficult to
elicit knee or ankle jerk b/l. Gait assessment deferred

Studies:

ECG [**2176-11-21**]
Sinus rhythm with first degree atrio-ventricular conduction
delay. Right
bundle-branch block. Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.

Echo [**2176-11-21**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60-70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: dilated, hypocontractile right ventricle without
evidence of major pulmonary hypertension (although pulmonary
artery pressure may have been underestimated), tricuspid
regurgitation, or pulmonic valve dysfunction

Chest Xray [**2176-11-21**]
Extensive left lung changes including interstial opacity,
effusion and hilar enlargement as well as right pulmonary edema.
Ongoing followup to resolution is recommended to exclude left
lung malignancy.

CTA Head/Neck [**2176-11-21**]
1. 7-mm aneurysm of the right M2 segment of the MCA. 3-mm
aneurysm of the 2 segment of the left MCA. No hemorrhage or
areas of significant vascular stenosis or occlusion.
2. Left pleural effusion and soft tissue density along the left
pulmonary artery, incompletely assessed.

CT Chest Abd Pelvis [**2176-11-21**]
1. Left hilar mass with upper lobe lymphangitic spread
concerning for a primary lung malignancy.
2. Left greater than right pleural effusions.
3. Numerous diffuse metastases within the liver and right
adrenal gland.
4. Left anterior abdominal wall subcutaneous metastasis

Abdominal ultrasound [**2176-11-21**]:
1. Diffusely infiltrated liver with innumerable nodules,
concerning for
diffuse metastatic disease. A CT is recommended for further
evaluation
2. Small perihepatic ascites, and as well as right pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old woman with history of dementia and CHF who presented
with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock and found to have
metastatic cancer.  She expired on [**2176-11-25**] at 1:40pm.

# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure. She originally presented with
hypoxia and dyspnea, likely related to an underlying lung
malignancy.  Her respiratory status continued to decline despite
high flow oxygen mask use and she ultimately went into hypoxic
respiratory arrest causing her death.  She was DNR/DNI during
this stay.

# Septic Shock: She presented with hypotension requiring
pressors.  She met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis > 12K, RR>20
and it was felt most likely to be a pulmonary source of
infection.  She was started on Vancomycin and Meropenem, as well
as Levaquin for healthcare-associated pneumonia.  She was later
found to have a left hilar lung mass that may have been
contributing to a post-obstructive pneumonia.  She was given IV
fluids for resuscitation and maintained on Levophed for pressure
support.

# Metastatic Cancer: She was diagnosed with metastatic cancer
during this admission of unknown primary.  She had subcutaneous
nodule on her abdomen and elevated liver enzymes and was found
to have a left hilar lung mass suspicious for a lung cancer
primary on CT scan.  She was also found to have multiple
metastases to her liver.

# Congestive Heart Failure:  She had some evidence of volume
overload on exam and chest xray but was not diuresed due to
likely septic shock.  She had a TTE on admission that showed a
preserved EF but hypocontractile right ventricle with severe
pulmonary hypertension.

# Weakness on neurologic exam: She had right lower extremity
weakness that was felt to be due to her prior hip fracture
