CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right first toe gangrene.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old black
female with right first toe gangrene refractory to
conservative treatment x1 month with a history of right calf
claudication x1 year.  She denies rest pain.  She claudicates
at least 8 feet.  Underwent arteriogram on [**2108-3-8**] which

common iliac with diffuse disease.  Right external iliac,
common femoral, and SFA were totally occluded.  The right
popliteal reconstitutes below the knee level.  The right
tibioperoneal trunk and PT are occluded.  The right AT is
attenuated, but refuses a DP with distal stenosis.  The right
peroneal reconstructs proximally, but is attenuated.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for angina at rest, relieved
with nitroglycerin.  The last episode was two weeks prior to
initial assessment which was on [**2108-3-8**].  Frequency is
infrequent.  She does complain of dyspnea with walking.  She
denies recent congestive heart failure, PND, orthopnea, or
edema.  She does have a history of CVA with no reoccurrence
of symptoms.  The patient is now admitted for elective
revascularization.

left ventricular systolic-diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary
wedge pressure 22, left end diastolic pressure 27.  Cardiac
index 2.6, ejection fraction of 24%.  Right coronary artery
was dominant.  Left main trunk was patent. AD was totally

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her family and ambulates with
a cane or walker.  She denies alcohol or smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  97.9, 142/72, 73, and
18, and 96% O2 saturation on room air.  Chest examination:
lungs are clear to auscultation.  Heart is a regular rhythm.
There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdominal
examination:  Obese, nontender, and nondistended, bowel
sounds diminished x4, no bruits.  Vascular examination:
Carotids without bruits.  Left brachial artery site of angio
without hematoma, clean, dry, and intact.  Pulse examination
shows brachioradial arteries on the left side 1+, 2+, ulnar
2+, femorals are absent on the left, popliteals absent on the
left.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are absent.
The patient has 1+ femorals on the right with no pulses
palpable distal to the femorals on the right.  Neurologically
she is grossly intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2108-3-28**], and she underwent a
right axillofem bypass which was complicated by
intraoperative ischemic ST changes.  Transesophageal
echocardiogram showed essentially only lateral minimal wall
motion and with lateral wall being akinetic to hypokinetic.
The patient was admitted to the SICU, intubated for continued
vasopressor and respiratory support.  The patient required
dobutamine at 3 mcg/kg/min for pressor support, IV Heparin
was begun, serial enzymes were obtained.

Postoperative hematocrit was 35.7 which drifted to 31.3.  BUN
and creatinine remained stable at 19 and 0.4.  Initial CK was
105 with a MB of 1 and troponin less than 0.30
.................... troponins remaining flat.  Cardiology
was requested to assist in patient management and management
of her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  Recommendations were
continue hydration, hold diuresis.  They could increase her
metoprolol to 75 tid.  Echocardiogram was obtained which
showed an ejection fraction of 10%.

Patient was transferred after extubation to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care.  By postoperative day three,
her diet was advanced to tolerated.  She continued with
aggressive pulmonary toilet.  Her Swan was discontinued, and
she remained in the VICU for continuing monitoring and
surveillance.  Physical Therapy to see the patient and felt
that she would require rehabilitation once she is medically
stable.

As she continued to have episodes of atrial
fibrillation/flutter, which eventually was controlled with
increasing her beta blockade.  The patient required
manipulation of her ACE inhibitors and beta blockers to
improve her rate control.  She remained on perioperative
Levaquin while lines were in place.  She was transferred to
the regular nursing floor on postoperative day number eight.

Often blood pressure systolically is 120-150, and they felt
from their standpoint that she was at a bed at
rehabilitation, they can be discharged from their standpoint.
Remaining hospital course is unremarkable.

At the time of discharge, lungs were clear, dry, and intact.
She had a functioning axobifem graft.  The patient should
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in two weeks time.  She is then
to followup with her primary care physician once discharged
from rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Acetaminophen 325 mg [**2-2**] q4-6h prn as indicated.
2. Protonix 40 mg q day.
3. Pravastatin 80 mg q day.
4. Digoxin 250 mcg q day.
5. Metoprolol 50 mg tid.
6. Aspirin 81 mg q day.
7. Lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
8. Coumadin 3 mg q day.
9. Captopril 50 mg tid.
10. Insulin-sliding scale in six insulin doses.  Please see
enclosed flow sheet.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient's INR should be monitored on
a continual basis until she is in a steady therapeutic state
for her atrial fibrillation with a goal INR 2.0-2.5.  Patient
should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in two weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Aortoiliac disease status post axillobifemoral bypass.
2. Myocardial infarction by enzymes, stable.
3. Diabetes controlled.
4. Blood loss anemia corrected.
5. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation rate controlled.
