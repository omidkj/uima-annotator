History of Present Illness:
HPI: 73 y/o male with HTN, h/o of a GI bleed, presented to
[**Hospital3 7569**] on [**8-25**] with right foot pain.  The right hallux
was found to be grossly gangrenous and was subsequently
amputated under local anesthesia.  There is concern for
osteomyelitis, and his physicians at [**Location (un) **] felt a BKA was
appropriate.
.
Report from [**Location (un) **] stated that pt's ECG showed possible
ischemic changes, his troponin climbed from 1.23 to 8.31, and an
echo showed anterior apical hk (ef 40-45%), so it was felt he
would need to be transferred for evaluation of possible ongoing
ischemia, and failing this, to clear him from a cardiac
standpoint to undergo this surgery.  He has denied chest pain
throughout the admission.  Other pertinent findings include a
creatinine of 2.9 and a serum glucose of 447 with no known
history of diabetes.

He was transferred on IV nitro and heparin, as well as asa,
