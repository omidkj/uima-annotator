Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypertensive urgency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 29585**] is a 70 year-old female with a history of
hypertension and diabetes who presents with hypertensive
urgency.
.
Over the past 3 weeks, the patient has had dyspnea on exertion.
She noted that after 2 blocks she is very short of breath; there
is no associated chest pain, nausea/vomiting.
.
The patient gets her routine medical care in [**Country 29586**] and is
currently visiting family in the [**Location (un) 86**] area.  She has
previously been seen at [**Company 191**]; given her disatisfaction with her
blood pressure management, she presented for evaluation in
[**Hospital Ward Name 23**] today.  Exam at that time showed a blood pressure of
250/108; she was oriented to person, time but thought she was in
[**Location (un) 29587**].  Given the degree of hypertension noted, she was
sent to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, vitals showed a temperature of 97.7, HR 60, initial
blood pressure of 164/90 and a RR of 20. The blood pressure
increased to 224/94.  Finger stick was 234.  An EKG showed
ST-elevations in V2-V3; given these findings, the cath lab was
activated and she was taken for angiography.  IV heparin, plavix
600mg and 5mg IV lopressor were given; aspirin was held given
her allergy.
.
In the cath lab blood pressures was 258/92 with a HR of 56;
nitroprusside was started (0.194 mcg/kg/min) and titrated up to
1.613 mcg/kg/min.  The blood pressure remained elevated to >250
systolic with MAPs >150.  10mg of IV hydralazine was given at
the end of the case.
.
Currently, the patient denies any headache, blurry vision, chest
pains.  She is generally feeling well.
.
Upon review of her OMR record, she has a note from [**2149**] that
notes a BP of 240/110.  At that time, she was on lisinopril 40mg
daily.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.  All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.

Past Medical History:
Cardiac Risk Factors: (+)Diabetes, (-)Dyslipidemia,
(+)Hypertension
Cardiac History: CABG, PCI, Pacemaker/ICD:  None.
.
OTHER PAST HISTORY:
1. Hypertension:  Patient says she's been hypertensive
"forever".  She cannot recall any prior BP meds other than the
lisinopril or hydralazine.  She occasionally check her BP and
noted it to regularly be >200 systolic.
2. Diabetes
3. Dementia
.


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse; she drinks an
occasional glass of wine on special occasions.  There is no
family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden
death.  Her mother and one sister have high blood pressure.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 158/58 mm Hg while lying flat.  It decreased
to 130 systolic and the nitride was shut off.  Soon thereafter,
it increased back to 230s systolic.  Pulse was 65 beats/min and
regular, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min with an 02 of 98%
on room air. Generally the patient was well developed, well
nourished and well groomed.
.
There was no thyromegaly. The respirations were not labored and
there were no use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to
ascultation bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no
adventitial sounds or rubs.
.
The heart sounds revealed a normal S1 and the S2 was normal.
There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.  There was an
audible S4.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft
nontender; there was mild distension/obesity. The extremities
had no pallor, cyanosis or cyanosis; there was 1+ edema
bilaterally.  There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits; a right femoral sheath was in place.  Inspection and/or
palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis
dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate in the 60s.  The PR
interval was slightly prolonged.  There was evidence of LVH.
ST-elevations were noted in V3-V4.

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through a 7 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French left [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.

Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed a
LMCA
without angiographically significant coronary artery disease.
The LAD
had a 30% mid-segment stenosis. The LCX had a 70% discrete
stenosis in
the mid portion. The RCA had an 80% mid-vessel stenosis with a
40%
distal stenosis.
