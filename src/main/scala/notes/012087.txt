sick contacts, N/V, diarrhea, weakness, paresthesias,
visual/auditory changes, dysuria, rash, or mental status
changes. She has mild orthopnea and DOE, both of which are
baseline, but has been mildly more SOB this week.
.
In the ED she was found to be in Afib w/ RVR up to the 130s and
received 10mg IV diltiazem x 3 and given 30mg PO diltiazem. A
RUQ ultrasound revealed dilated biliary and pancreatic ducts and
her pain was controlled with IV morphine 0.5mg x 2. ERCP was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and plan to take the patient for an exam in the AM.
.
On the floor, the patient remained tachycardic and she remained
tachypneic. The MICU was called to evaluate the patient for

the patient "felt better" and denied any chest pain. Her
abdominal pain was mild and she denied nausea.

[**2136-1-31**] Chest Xray - The heart size is moderately enlarged but
stable. The ascending aorta is very tortuous, unchanged. There
is no significant change in perihilar interstitial opacities
suggesting mild pulmonary edema associated by bilateral pleural
effusions, small to moderate.
.
[**2136-1-25**] U/S liver: Dilated intra- and extra-hepatic biliary
ducts, common bile duct, and pancreatic duct. Tiny hyperechoic
focus in the distal common bile duct, suggesting obstructing
stone versus extrinsic compression. Single enlarged lymph node
in the porta hepatis. Single non-mobile, non-obstructing
gallbladder stone. No evidence of acute cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 2952**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of CAD, HTN, Afib, s/p
pacemaker, severe AS who presents with abdominal pain, rapid
Afib, and chest pain.
.
1)Atrial fibrillation with RVR: She has history of atrial
fibrillation, not previously treated with anticoagulation,
controlled prior with amiodarone and amlodipine.  She presented
in rapid atrial fibrillation with associated tachypnea requiring
transfer to the MICU.  She was seen by the cardiology consult
team and she was treated with diltiazem and continued on
amiodarone.  In addition, she was started on coumadin, with a
heparin bridge, per cardiology recommendations.  She was not
cardioverted during this admission, but will follow up in one
month as an outpatient to further address whether cardioversion
is indicated.  She did well and was converted to long acting
diltiazem prior to discharge and continued on outpatient regimen
of amiodarone 100mg every other day.  She will follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] as an outpatient.
.
2)Chest pain/CAD: she has h/o stable angina at home, on
aspirin/statin/acei/ntg. Episode of increased chest pain w/
palpatations likely represents demand myocardial ischemia in the
setting of RVR, cardiac enzymes and slight troponin leak also
consistent with this.  Her rate was controlled and her chest
pain resolved.  She was continued on statin and aspirin.
.
3)Abdominal Pain: Initially there was concern for possible CBD
stone and biliary obstruction based on patients symptoms and
ultrasound.  She was evaluated by the ERCP fellow, however no
intervention was undertaken given patients acute cardiac issues.
 Her abdominal pain resolved and she had no LFT abnormalities or
concerns for cholangitis.  Given underlying medical issues,
intervention was deferred given symptom resolution.  She will
follow up as an outpatient, as she did have gall bladder stone
on ultrasound.
.
3)Asthma -pt with 20-30 year h/o asthma, although no h/o
smoking, living with a smoker or other exposures. She has been
treated for acute infection and COPD flare since admission.  She
completed a course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone during her
admission.  She was also treated with prednisone taper of 30mgx3
days ([**Date range (1) 2953**]), 20mg x3days([**Date range (1) 2954**]), 10mg x3 ([**Date range (1) 2955**])days
then stop.  She was also continued on inhaled agents including
fluticasone and salmeterol as well as prn atrovent nebulizers.
Albuterol nebulizers were held because of her tachycardia.
.
4)Aortic stenosis: severe AS (<0.8cm2) and moderate LVH on ECHO,
h/o chronic dizziness but no syncopal episodes at home recently.

.
5)Hypertension: normotensive currently on regimen of dilt and
amio.  Her lisinopril 10mg daily was held during admission
because of sbp <120.
.
6)Dyslipidemia: continue lipitor
.
7)Chronic renal failure: approximately baseline currently, with
Cr 1.
.
8)Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid (TSH checked on admission,
wnl)
.
9)Glaucoma: continue timolol

10) FEN: nectar thick liquids, soft diet per speech and swallow
evaluation.

11)Code status: No CPR; Intubation OK (confirmed with daughter
[**Name (NI) 2956**] [**2136-2-1**])
