Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with diastolic CHF, COPD, restrictive lung
disease ([**3-2**] to scoliosis), OSA on home O2 at night (1-1.5L)
presented to the ED with four days of dyspnea on exertion over a
few days prior to admission with accompanying ankle swelling. Pt
attributes this acute change to consuming a large amount of
salty foods while spending time with family visiting from out of
town. She denies any weight change, fever/chills, cough, wheeze,
sputum, or hemoptysis, no recent colds or URI symotoms. In the
ED, her initial ABG was 7.33/75/61. She was briefly tried on
BiPAP but eventually refused it. She got Furosemide 40mg IV,
Methylprednisolone, Ceftriaxone, and Azithromycin. Given the
abnormal ABG, she was admitted to the ICU for treatment of CHF
and obstructive lung disease.

While in the ICU, she was diuresed overnight and the following
day with a total of 700/930 from midnight of the day of
admission until approximately 3:30 when she was assessed by the
general medicine team. During this time, she received a total of
100 mg IV of Lasix, 15 mg of Zaroxolyn and 2mg of Bumetanide.
She was transferred to the floor on 4L NC at 87-90% O2
saturation which is her baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with HTN, Diastolic CHF, PAF, COPD, OSA and
restrictive lung disease here with increasing dyspnea on
exertion and peripheral edema x 4 days, transferred from the
MICU on [**9-15**] for continued treatment of CHF exacerbation. The
following issues were investigated during her hospitalization:
.
#Dyspnea on exertion/CHF: Likely due to a CHF decompensation on
top of baseline poor pulmonary function. Pt has a history of
diastolic dysfunction with reported dietary non-compliance
shortly before hospitalization, increasing peripheral edema and
rales, and evidence of pulm edema on CXR. No obvious ischemia on
EKG. She was aggressively diuresed with Zaroxolyn and Lasix. Her
outpatient regimen of Bumex was also used. A repeat CXR showed
resolution of the pleural effusion and no worsening of CHF.
However, she developed azotemia as a result of the aggressive
diuresis and for the remainder of her hospital stay, the goal
was even volume balance maintained with frequent, gentle fluid
boluses and prn diuresis. She was gradually started back on her
outpatient dose of Bumex by discharge.

# C. difficile: Pt. was found to be C. diff. positive on [**9-21**] at
which time she was started on Flagyl and placed on precautions.
Plan for 14 day course.
.
#Obstructive Lung Disease - The cause of the patient's
presenting symptoms was not felt to be a COPD exacerbation. She
was maintained on albuterol and spiriva inhalers and O2, with an
O2 saturation titrated to <92% given her history of C)2
retention and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
#Renal insufficiency - Initially the renal insufficiency was
thought to be due to the CHF exacerbation and with inital
diuresis, the patient's creatinine improved. However, with
additional diuresis, both BUN and creatinine rapidly increased.
Once patient's O2 requirement decreased and her pulmonary exam
improved with diuresis, her diuretics were held and frequent,
small boluses of NS were given to improve kidney function.
Kidney function was improved and stable on discharged.
.
#HTN - Patient was maintained on outpatient regimen of
Nifedipine and Diltiazem.
.
#Anticoagulation - Pt. has a history of PAF and retinal artery
thrombosis for which she was anticoagulated with Coumadin. Upon
admission, she was supratherapeutic with an INR of 5.3. Her
Coumadin was held and restarted once she'd become therapeutic.
.
# Anemia - Pt. had a 5 point Hct drop on transfer from ICU,
which was then found to return to baseline. With the multiple
fluid shifts during this hospitalization, her Hct fluctuated.
She was guiaic negative with no other sources of bleeding.
.
#Hypothyroidism - Pt's TSH was 1.1. She was maintained on her
outpatient regimen of Levoythyroxine
