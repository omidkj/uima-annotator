This is a continuation of the previous discharge summary
dictated up to the hospital course:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Gastrointestinal:  The patient was
initially admitted with a transaminitis with very elevated
alkaline phosphatase.  Abdominal CT did not show any evidence
of ductal dilatation.  It was initially thought that his
transaminitis was most likely due to infiltration of his
lymphoma in the patient's liver.  GI was initially consulted
for the possibility of performing a liver biopsy, but since
the patient's other issues took precedence over his immediate
liver biopsy, the decision was made to put this off and watch
his liver function tests through the rest of his hospital
course.  The patient's stool studies were checked for C.
difficile and ova and parasites.  These studies were
negative.  The patient was continued on Protonix q. day.  He
was also started on Flagyl and Levaquin for empiric coverage
of any possible abdominal infection.  It was also thought
that possibly the patient's increased transaminitis could be
secondary to a reinfection with CMV.  A CMV viral load was
checked which returned on [**2188-9-12**] as not detectable.
Infectious disease was consulted and the details of this
consultation are in the next section.  The patient's liver
function tests remained elevated until the patient received
his first pentostatin dose on [**2188-9-10**].  Because the patient
had not spiked a temperature and his renal and liver function
tests continued to be elevated, the decision was made to
discontinue his antibiotics, Levaquin and Flagyl, on
[**2188-9-10**].  After the patient received his first dose of
pentostatin on [**2188-9-10**], the patient's liver function tests
continued to improve throughout his hospital course.  At the
time of this dictation the patient's liver function tests are
considerably decreased from his admission tests.  It is now
thought that his transaminitis was most likely due to
infiltration of lymphoma in his liver and may have been
improved with therapy with pentostatin.  The patient
currently has no real complaints of abdominal pain and his
diarrhea has resolved.  The patient also had new splenic
masses on CT initially.  This was also thought to have been
due to infiltration of his lymphoma.  The patient will have a
repeat CT in one week after discharge, currently scheduled
for Tuesday, [**2188-9-23**] at 2 PM, to evaluate the progression of
his disease.

2. Pulmonary:  Upon admission the patient had complaints of a
chronic cough productive with yellow sputum, shortness of
breath, and increased oxygen requirement.  He had recently
completed a ciprofloxacin course of Pseudomonal pneumonia.
The chest CT performed on admission showed scattered small
nodules throughout.  It was unclear whether this may be due
to his lymphoma or a new infection.  The patient had a sputum
culture sent but it did not yield any data.  The patient's
Bactrim dose was temporarily held secondary to his decreased
counts, but was restarted the next day after admission for
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  The pulmonary team was consulted to perform
a bronchoscopy if indicated to rule out whether the patient's
pulmonary status was most likely due to lymphoma or whether
his pulmonary issues could be secondary to an opportunistic
infection.  Initially when pulmonary was consulted, they felt
that bronchoscopy was not indicated since the patient's
pulmonary issues were most likely secondary to the advance of
his lymphoma.  However, status post patient's pentostatin
dose on [**2188-9-10**], the patient's pulmonary status continued to
decrease.  Overnight on [**2188-9-10**] the patient had desaturated
to the 80s and had an increased oxygen requirement from 1.5
liters of oxygen to 2-3 liters.  He improved with Lasix 20 to
40 mg IV in one-time doses somewhat, however his pulmonary
status still remained poor.  In addition his lung examination
was worsened with more diffuse rhonchi and expiratory
wheezes.  Pulmonary evaluated the patient again and the
decision was made to perform a bronchoscopy on [**2188-9-12**] to
rule out any possible source of infection.  On [**2188-9-12**]
bronchoscopy was completed which showed inflamed airways with
thin white/clear secretions throughout.  The right middle
lobe and lingula were lavaged.  Specimens were sent for micro
and cytology.  However, post procedure, the patient had
decreased saturation, hypoventilating, and was dyspneic with
diffuse rhonchi.  He was given Lasix 20 mg IV and put out 300
cc.  He received albuterol nebulizers and was suctioned
nasally, with only partial improvement in his respiratory
status.  His saturations remained 92-96% on 40-100% oxygen.
Since required [**Hospital 30958**] nursing care, he was transferred to
the intensive care unit.  The patient was diuresed further in
the intensive care unit with 40 mg of Lasix one-time dose,
and his respiratory status improved from saturating on a
nonrebreather, to saturating 94-95% on four liters.  On the
next day, [**2188-9-13**], the patient was stable and was
transferred back to the bone marrow transplant service for
further management.  His pulmonary status continued to
improve throughout the rest of his hospital course.  He
currently is saturating 95-96% on four liters and this has
been stable for him.  He still has diffuse rhonchi through
his lung examination, predominantly at his bases, however
this is improved from prebronchoscopy.  The patient is to be
continued on a total 14-day course of Levaquin.  He should
continue with his Combivent inhaler every four to six hours.
The patient often refused nebulizer treatments.

On [**2188-9-16**] the patient's bronchoalveolar lavage results
returned showing positive Aspergillus infection in his
respiratory and fungal cultures.  The patient was started on
AmBisome 5 mg per kg dose q. day, and at the time of this
dictation has received two doses.  The patient will likely
continue with this therapy for at least one to two weeks if
not longer, since it will take some time for him to clear
this fungal infection.  Per pulmonary, the patient should
have a repeat CT scan which is currently scheduled for
[**2188-9-23**] at 2 PM to evaluate the effectiveness of the
treatment on his disease and the size of the nodules on CT.
The patient has been doing well with his AmBisome therapy.
He continues to have a productive cough with yellow sputum.

3. Recurrent DIC:  The patient had a significantly decreased
fibrinogen and platelet count on admission.  He was given
cryoprecipitate one-time dose.  He was also placed on a
heparin drip at 600 units per hour, which was increased to
800 units per hour several days later.  His fibrinogen began
to improve on this heparin drip and the patient was also
given [**1-31**] bags of cryoprecipitate prior to his pentostatin
infusion.  The reason for the heparin drip was because his
primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], stated that he had improved on
this in prior hospitalizations.  The patient received
fibrinogen and coagulation laboratory studies twice a day and
was closely monitored through his hospital course.  After his
pentostatin dose, the patient's fibrinogen levels continued
to improve.  At the time of this dictation, they have
remained above 100 for four to five days.  He has not
required any cryoprecipitate and he has not been on his
heparin drip since [**2188-9-12**].  The patient should continue to
be monitored for recurrence of his DIC, however it appears
that possibly the pentostatin has improved this issue.

4. Infectious disease:  Infectious disease was consulted with
regard to whether the patient may have a reinfection with
CMV.  They suggested performing liver and colon biopsies to
truly rule out whether this is a recurrence of the CMV and
also suggested starting valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis.
In light of the patient's negative CMV viral load on [**2188-9-12**]
and the patient's increased liver function tests, the
decision was made by the primary team to hold off on CMV
prophylaxis.  An
