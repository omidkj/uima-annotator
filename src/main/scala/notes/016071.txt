Date of Birth:  [**2054-7-16**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NSU


PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Right subdural hemorrhage.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Hematuria.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a pleasant 78-year-
old gentleman who was previously seen on Byros service and
discharged on [**2132-8-7**]. He had previously undergone
evacuation for right acute subdural hemorrhage. During his
prior admission, he had a traumatic Foley placed and
subsequently had copious excretion of blood from his
catheter. He required placement of a three-way catheter with
continuous irrigation for several days. Ultimately, he was
discontinued to rehabilitation with a regular Foley. On
[**2132-8-11**], he was brought to the Emergency Room from his
rehabilitation facility with increasing hematuria. He had
previously been doing well. Per report, the nurse [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 15651**] the Foley due to minimal urine output and had been
noticing an increasing amount of clots being excreted. He had
a creatinine of 4.5 at rehabilitation. Ultimately, he was
sent to the [**Hospital6 256**] for further
evaluation and management of acute renal failure with
hematuria. When he was seen at [**Hospital6 2018**], he complained of pain in his penis, as well as
secondary to Foley placement. He denies any nausea, vomiting,
chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath. He otherwise
denied complaint of any new issues.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic right subdural hematoma,
status post right parietal bur hole evacuation. He was noted
to have a left subdural collection, which was not evacuated
on his prior admission.

Coronary artery disease.

Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 50
percent.

Diabetes mellitus.

Hypercholesterolemia.

Right rotator cuff injury.

Cerebrovascular accident.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

Hematuria.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Folic acid 1 mg p.o. once daily.
2. Percocet.
3. ____________ p.o. b.i.d.
4. Lopressor 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Sliding scale insulin.
6. Subcutaneous heparin.
7. Dilantin 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is afebrile with a temperature of
98.7, blood pressure 115/55, heart rate 77, respiratory rate
18, saturation of 96 percent on room air. He appeared awake,
oriented and well. He had equal pupils and full extraocular
movements. His face was symmetric and his tongue was midline.
Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact. He had bilateral
rhonchi, right greater than left, and slight crackles at the
right lower base. Otherwise, his heart rate was regular. He
had a normal pulse. His abdomen was soft and nontender to
palpation. He had slight pitting edema of his bilateral lower
extremities below the knees.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the Medicine service
initially for management of his acute renal failure. He was
believed to have acute renal failure secondary to obstruction
given his decreased urine output from the Foley. Ultrasound
showed no hydronephrosis. His Foley was replaced and he was
ultimately switched to continuous irrigation.

During his course in the hospital, he was seen by Neurology
and followed. The repeat head CT showed slight progression of
the left subdural. Ultimately, he was taken to the Operating
Room for drainage of the left subdural. Upon admission, his
aspirin was discontinued.

On [**2132-8-12**], the Neurosurgery service was involved for
assessment of his increasing left subdural collection. He was
alert and oriented with fluent speech. He did not complain of
any worsening weakness compared to his prior baseline but did
have four to four plus weakness throughout bilateral
extremities. His speech and language function remained
intact. During his course in the hospital, his hematocrit
stayed stable in the range of 20-30.

On [**2132-8-13**], he was taken to the Operating Room for
drainage of his left subdural hemorrhage. He underwent two
bur hole drainage and placement of subdural catheter. He
tolerated the procedure well with no complications. Please
see Operative Note for further details. He spent the night in
the recovery area and did well. Subsequently, he was slowly
elevated from his bed and ultimately, the drain was removed.
Postoperative CT scans showed a stable appearance of his
fluid collection and likely some cerebrospinal fluid
accumulation in the cavity.

He was seen by Physical Therapy and continued to do well. He
continued to have some hematuria and was seen by Urology.
Ultimately, Urology recommended continuous irrigation until
he cleared for 24 hours and then switching the three-way
catheter to a Foley. However, his hematuria persisted for
several days. Ultimately, Urology took him for cystoscopy. On
[**2132-8-22**], he underwent cystoscopy showing some bladder
stones and a small laceration that has scarred over. He
underwent lithiasis and currently is doing well. He currently
has a Foley in place.

He should continue on ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. for
four days. The Foley should remain in until he is fully
ambulatory and then can be removed. Urology would like to
hold the antiplatelet medications for ten days. However,
Neurosurgery would prefer to hold it for 14 days until follow-
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] and a repeat head CT.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Folic acid 1 mg p.o. once daily.
2. _______ 150 mg p.o. once daily.
3. Nystatin oral suspension 5 mg p.o. once daily p.r.n.
4. Zolpidem tartrate 5 mg p.o. q h.s. p.r.n.
5. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n.
6. Finasteride 5 mg p.o. once daily.
7. Subcutaneous heparin 5,000 units b.i.d.
8. Dilantin 30 mg p.o. b.i.d. to be continued until seen in
   follow-up.
9. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10.      Tamsulosin 0.4 mg p.o. q h.s.
11.      Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. times four days.


FOLLOW UP:  He should see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in clinic for follow-up
in two weeks from the date of discharge with a repeat head
CT. All anticoagulation except for subcutaneous heparin
should be held until then.

He should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the urology clinic in
[**1-31**] weeks and per Urology, the Foley can be discontinued
after he is fully ambulatory.
