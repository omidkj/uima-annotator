Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R IJ placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 89 year-old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG,
CHF (EF 25%) and PAF who initially p/w respiratory distress,
transferred to the ICU on day of admission for continued
borderline hypoxia and tachypnea, DNR/I, briefly on Dopa gtt for
hypotension, then called out to floor on [**3-20**] at night, now
re-transferred to MICU for recurrent SOB.
.
Of note, two recent admission: First admission ([**2-18**] - [**2-20**]) was
for an enterococcal UTI; he was treated with ampicillin and
discharged to home. Second admission ([**3-1**] to [**3-8**]) was for CHF
in the setting of afib with RVR; he was treated with rate
controlling agents (amiodarone was added to metoprolol);
valsartan was also added to his regimen. At rehab the day before
admission, he developed labored breathing and inability to
urinate.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were HR 124 BP 80s-90s/30s-40s
RR:20-30 O2Sat 97% on 2L NC. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 101296**], down from [**Numeric Identifier 101294**] on last
admission [**2165-3-1**]. A CXR showed bilateral effusions,
atelectasis, and appearance concerning for left lower lobe
pneumonia. He was given 500 mg levofloxacin given and 2 liters
of NS. Also recieved nebs given.
.
On the floor, his labored breathing -> IV lasix, foley placed ->
350cc of cola-colored urine. ABG 7.40/38/64. On arrival to the
MICU, pt with SBPs in 80's then drifting into ?60's-70's. He was
transiently on Dopa gtt, weaned off and started on empiric Vanc
and Zosyn for possible PNA although afebrile and normal WBC but
productive cough. Lactate was initially 3.0, then trended down
to 1.4. Pt had reportedly his flu shot. Legionella Ag was
negative. A repeat Echo did not show worsening EF or tamponade
but worsened MR. Elevated cardiac enzymes were felt to be due to
past event or demand ischemia. Also in acute on chronic renal
failure with Cr of 3.3. INR supratherapeutic, thus coumadin was
held. Once off the dopa, he was called out to the floor in AM on
[**3-20**]. However, developed AF/RVR and was kept in the ICU until
9PM. He received 5mg IV lopressor with rate control. He also
received 40 IV lasix since it was felt that he was now fluid
overloaded. Once stable, he came to the floor on 9PM on [**3-20**].
.
On the floor, he triggered overnight for tachypnea and AF/RVR.
He received 10 IV dilt with rate control. He also received
2x250cc IVF boluses for SBP in 90s. A foley was placed and 1L
dark urine came back. UA without infection. In the morning, he
was restarted on abx (Vanc/CTX this time). He was found to be
tachypneic again. ABG was 7.38/41/77. CXR was ordered. He was
given 40 IV lasix, O2 was uptitrated on NC, then switched to FM.
Nebs were given. It was felt that he was tiring out and would
benefit from retransfer to MICU, also for possible lasix gtt
since BP dropped to low 90s after IV lasix bolus.
.
On arrival to the ICU on [**3-21**], he was less tachypneic, satting
100% on 3L NC but still using accessory muscles. He denied any
CP, palpitations, but has productive cough (whitish sputum x2
weeks). No F/C/N.
.
ROS: negative for abdominal pain, N/V/D, urinary sxs. Last BM
few days ago.

Brief Hospital Course:
89M w/ CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 25%), PAF p/w tachypnea, cough,
course c/b hypotension in MICU (briefly on dopa gtt), Vanc/Zosyn
for PNA, AF/RVR, A/CRF, on floor again tachypneic,
re-transferred to MICU for possible noninvasive ventilation,
instead pt remained stable on NC, was treated for 7 days with
Vanc/CTX for PNA, remained labile with regards to BP and UOP,
was initially started on NTG gtt and Lasix gtt, then switched to
Milrinone gtt and continue on Lasix gtt with moderate increase
in UOP. His Cr continued to increase and the patient stated that
he would not want hemodialysis if this became necessary.
Decision was made to transition to comfort c
