Diarrhea x 8 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75 year old man with a history of metastatic colon cancer to
liver s/p lobectomy, CAD s/p MI, and CVA with residual weakness
who presented to the ED with weakness. Pt was recently admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**7-9**] to [**7-13**] with dx of diarrhea, NSTEMI in setting
of hypovolemia and an enterococcal UTI. Pt was discharged after
3 days with a 7-day course of Levaquin. At home, pt's family
states that he continued to complain of stomach pressure, "felt
like air inside". He also continued to have [**3-16**] loose bowel
movements per day. He was drinking some but not taking good po.
On day of admission, pt was noted to be more lethargic, not
getting out of bed. Pt's family states that they were taking his
temps and he has been afebrile.
.
On arrival to the ER, pt's HR was in the 140s with an SBP in the
70s. After 2L of fluid, pt's SBP was still in the 70s so a
femoral line was urgently placed for pressors. He was then
cardioverted with resumption of sinus rhythm and improvement of
his SBP to 110s. Pt received a total of 3L in the ED and one
dose of Vancomycin.


Past Medical History:
-Colon cancer status post 5-FU and leucovorin [**1-15**] and s/p right
liver lobectomy for three liver mets in [**1-16**], complicated by a
bile leak with catheter removal in [**11-16**], persistent sinus tract
drainage from the site.
-CAD s/p MI
-Hypercholesterolemia
-HTN x 10 years
-CVA (left cerebellar stroke)
-Glaucoma resulting in right eye blindness. Both eyes were
operated on at some point.


Social History:
He lives with his wife and daughter; he neither smokes nor
drinks
alcohol.  He formerly worked as a cook.


Family History:
There are no strokes or neurological disorders in the family.

Imaging:
CXR [**7-20**]: There is a right CVL with the tip at the junction of
the SVC and right atrium and no PTX. Compared to the prior, the
left lung is stable but the right lung shows some density
increasing towards the base and laterally suggestive of pleural
fluid/thickening and increased atelectasis; followup is
recommended to see if there is further progression. The heart
and mediastinum are stable.
.
CT Abd/pelvis s IV contrast (po contrast only):
1. Diffusely edematous small bowel is a nonspecific finding.
There is no evidence of bowel obstruction, perforation, or
pneumatosis intestinalis.
2. Stable 14 mm left hepatic hemangioma.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Stable subcentimeter bilateral renal hypodensities, too small
to
characterize, but probably representing cysts.
.
TTE [**7-9**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small
and underfilled. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). A mid-cavitary gradient is identified (61 mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old man with a history of metastatic colon cancer to
liver s/p lobectomy, CAD s/p MI, and CVA with residual weakness
who presented to the ED on [**7-16**] with fever, weakness, diarrhea;
found to have BPs in the 70s with HR in the 140s. He was found
to be in afib with RVR, was cardioverted successfully in the ED.
He received 6L NS IVF resuscitation and transferred to the unit
for further management.
Of note, he had a CT abd in the ED which showed diffusely
edematous bowel edema c/w enterocolitis. He was started on
levaquin/flagyl to cover GI organisms and cover for ? c.dif
given a recent course of Levaquin for an enterococcal UTI.
.
Pt was continued on IVFs in the ICU, and briefly started on
pressors to maintain his MAPs >65. He was quickly weaned off
pressors and transferred to the floor on [**7-18**]. On the floor, he
was evaluated by GI who felt it was likely infectious vs
ischemic and recommended adding cholestyramine +/- flex-sig if
his diarrhea did not resolve. His stool output continued to
worsen on [**7-20**], and the MICU was contact[**Name (NI) **] at 1900 regarding a BP
of 62/P in a patient who had lost IV access. A R SC line was
urgently placed and patient received 1L IVF bolus which raised
his BP to 110/68 prior to transfer to the ICU for further
observation.
.
Of note, patient had received Lisinopril 5mg x1 and Metoprolol
12.5gm x1 that AM as well as Lasix 20mg IV x1 at 1440. He
otherwise was started on a heparin gtt for atrial fibrillation.


# Hypotension:
Pt with increased stool output of >2L on readmission to MICU,
with poor IV access and negative fluid balance. Pt appeared
hypovolemic per exam likely from combination of diarrhea,
aggressive diuresis and antihypertensive medications. Placed CVL
and given 2L NS resuscitation with improvement of BP to 110/68
prior to tx to ICU. CVP 6cm. Antihypertensives were initially
held and IVF resuscitation continued. Once BPs were stable,
lopressor 12.5 BIB was started for rate control as this was
thought to be contributing to his hypotension. With [**Month (only) **]. HR the
patient's diastolic dysfunction improved and BP remained stable.
The patient failed [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test so stress dose steroids were
started and cont. for 5 days.
.
# Diarrhea:
Pt with persistant diarrhea that appeared to improve prior to
arrival on the floor, with acute worsening prior to returning
