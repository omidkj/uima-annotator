Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for pulmonary eval

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
Central Venous Line

History of Present Illness:
48 year-old woman with history of chronic interstitial lung
disease/pulmonary fibrosis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on
[**6-12**] liters oxygen at home who presented to [**Hospital 67742**] Medical
Center (NH) on [**2129-10-8**] with c/o SOB.  She was found to have O2
saturations in the mid-80's (baseline is low 90's) and was
tachypneic.  Her saturations improved on Bi-PAP of 16 and 7 with
100% FiO2.  While still in the ER, she went into atrial flutter
which resolved with Metoprolol 5 mg x 3. The patient was moved
to the [**Location (un) 67742**] MICU. On [**10-9**] she was emergently intubated. She
had a R IJ central line and a left radial a-line placed. The OSH
records are spare, but it appears that the pt was on abx,
possibly bactrim, zithromax, and/or zosyn, and solumedrol though
more information is unavailable. The pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further pulmonary w/u.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU the pt was already intubated but was
breathing uncomfortably and was in A fib with rapid RVR. The pt
was given lopressor 5 mg IV X3 with no effect on her heart rate.
The pt was placed on a dilt gtt for planned improved rate
control.

RADIOLOGY:
==========
CTA [**2129-10-15**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Ill-defined ground-glass opacities in a peripheral and
basilar distribution. Findings are compatible with patient's
provided history of interstitial lung disease.
2. Linear calcification at the left lung base with anterior rib
fractures visualized along the seventh and eight ribs; likely
post-traumatic
.
CT ABD/PELV:
===========
IMPRESSION:
1. Significantly limited study due to attenuation by the
patient's large body habitus.
2. No significant change in diffuse ground-glass opacity of the
visualized lungs. This could represent chronic interstitial lung
disease; however, underlying infection cannot be excluded.
3. Prominence of the extrahepatic biliary duct at 12 mm. No
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Possible tiny gallstones
but there is no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
4. No intra-abdominal fluid collection or abscess identified
.
ECHO [**2129-10-13**]:
===========
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is difficult to assess but may be normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

[**Date range (1) 51721**] and 1022-10/25- Stool cx negative for c diff x 3
(twice)
[**11-10**], [**11-26**] sputum + for Klebsiella multidrug resistant

[**11-23**]: CTA IMPRESSION:
1. Very limited study secondary to ventilation state of patient
and arm positioning. No evidence of pulmonary embolism in the
main pulmonary artery, right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary
artery. Distal vessels not fully assessed secondary to technical
difficulties.
2. Slight improvement of the left apex and anterior aspect of
the right and left lower lobes in terms of ground-glass
opacities. Worsening/progression of opacities at the bases. This
could represent intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
3. Extensive mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy essentially
unchanged in appearance compared to the previous study.
.
[**12-3**] KUB :One portable supine view of the abdomen. Comparison
with [**2129-11-30**]. A Dobbhoff feeding tube is in place. This
terminates in the region of the distal end of the gastric antrum
or duodenal bulb. The bowel gas pattern is not remarkable.
IMPRESSION: Feeding tube in place.
