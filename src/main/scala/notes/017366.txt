Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**5-26**] and taken to the Operating Room for L3-S1 interbody fusion
through an anterior approach. Please refer to the dictated
operative note for further details. The surgery was without
complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a
stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative
DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were given per standard
protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2
he returned to the operating room for a scheduled L3-S1
decompression with PSIF as part of a staged 2-part procedure.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The second surgery was also without complication and the patient
was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. Postoperative
HCT was stable. A bupivicaine epidural pain catheter placed at
the time of the posterior surgery remained in place until postop
day one. He was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet
was advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral
pain medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on
POD#2 from the second procedure. He was fitted with a lumbar
warm-n-form brace for comfort. Physical therapy was consulted
for mobilization OOB to ambulate. Hospital course was otherwise
unremarkable. On the day of discharge the patient was afebrile
with stable vital signs, comfortable on oral pain control and
tolerating a regular diet.
