Service:  MEDICINE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Dyspnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old
female with a past medical history significant for end stage
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on four liters of home
O2 with O2 saturations in the low 90s, multiple intubations
in the past, on chronic steroids, who is admitted for
dyspnea.  The patient was recently seen at the [**Hospital1 346**] in [**2137-11-16**] for dyspnea and
cough.  She was treated with steroids and nebulizers and she
was discharged to Pulmonary Rehabilitation.

The patient was discharged to Pulmonary Rehabilitation and
then was only at home for two days and experienced dyspnea
and was readmitted on [**2138-1-22**], this admission.

The patient states that she has worsening dyspnea on
exertion.  She has a cough which has been productive of white
sputum for approximately one month.  She denies any nausea,
vomiting or abdominal pain; she has stable two pillow
orthopnea.  She denies any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She
denies any lower extremity edema.

In the Emergency Department, she was given Solu-Medrol
nebulizer, Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin.  She had a chest x-ray
done which showed enlarging right pulmonary mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; four liters of
nasal cannula oxygen at home; on chronic steroids ,
Prednisone 20 q. day.   She had pulmonary function tests in
[**2134**] which showed FEV1/FVC ratio of 48% predicted.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diverticulosis.
4.  Status post appendectomy and cholecystectomy.
5.  Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus secondary to
steroid use.
6.  Multifocal atrial tachycardia.
7.  Depression.

ALLERGIES:   She has an allergy to percocet which causes GI
upset.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Flonase.
2.  Glipizide.
3.  Lisinopril.
4.  Calcium carbonate.
5.  Fosamax.
7.  Magnesium.
8.  Multivitamin.
9.  Paxil.
10. Protonix.
11, Verapamil.
12. Vitamin C.
13. Nifedipine.
14. Prednisone.
15. Ativan.
16. Atrovent.
17. Lipitor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission she had a temperature of
99.0 F.; heart rate of 84; blood pressure of 120/72;
respiratory rate of 24.  She was saturating 94% on four
liters.  Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.  Chest:
She had right basilar crackles.  Cardiac examination was
normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.  Abdominal examination was
benign.  Extremity examination showed no edema.  Neurological
examination was nonfocal.

LABORATORY:  She had a white blood cell count of 24.2,
hematocrit of 39.2, platelets of 437.  Her chem-7 was notable
for an elevated glucose of 184.

She did have a chest x-ray done which showed an interval
enlargement in right pulmonary nodule.

She had an EKG done which showed wandering pacemaker with a
rate of 90; no ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was maintained on intravenous
Solu-Medrol and was started on Levofloxacin for presumed
pneumonia.  Her pulmonary status remained stable until
[**2138-1-26**], where she was found to have an O2
saturation of 80% on four liters nasal cannula.  This
responded to an O2 saturation in the low to mid 90's on
non-rebreather.  Considering her history of end stage chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and multiple intubations, she
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  At that time she
was intubated.  A repeat chest x-ray was done which showed
enlarging mass of the lateral segment of the right middle
lobe with near total collapse of the right lower lobe.  This
is highly concerning for a neoplastic process.

The patient did have a PET scan in [**2136**] for work-up of this
mass which was negative for cancer, however, this interval
enlargement is suspicious for a neoplastic process.

The patient did receive a bronchoscopy at that time while she
was in the Intensive Care Unit.  Cytology specimens were
taken, however, were not catalogued and analyzed, thus no
cytology specimens are available.  The patient did have
cultures sent on bronchial washings which were negative for
infection.

She did complete a full course of Levofloxacin.  The patient
was told of her presumed diagnosis of cancer.  She did not
want to pursue any further diagnostic procedures such was
repeat bronchoscopy or CT guided biopsy; however, the patient
still requests to be intubated if needed and to be full code.
The patient was extubated successfully and was transferred
back to the floor.  The patient was changed to Prednisone 60
mg p.o. q. day and her intravenous Solu-Medrol 40 q. eight
was discontinued.  She completed a full course of
antibiotics.   All micro data is no growth.

The patient was seen by Physical Therapy who recommended
placement into a rehabilitation facility.

On the floor, a repeat discussion was had with the patient in
regards to her prognosis and her presumed diagnosis of
cancer; again she declined any diagnostic procedures or
further work-up.

Code status was again discussed.  She did want to remain full
code and to be intubated again if necessary.  The patient is
currently awaiting placement to pulmonary rehabilitation
facility.  She is on oral Prednisone and multiple inhalers
including Salmeterol steroid inhalers, Atrovent and albuterol
p.r.n.
