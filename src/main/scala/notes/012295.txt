Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
acute renal failure and pneumonia (transfer from outside
hospital)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy, lumbar puncture x2

History of Present Illness:
Pt 46 y/o female with PMHx significant for HIV who presented to
Good [**Hospital 5159**] Hospital on [**2125-2-5**] with cough, fever, and
diarrhea. She had visited her freind in the hospital with PNA 2
weeks prior to presentation. Patient was initially put on 5 day
course of Zithromax outpatient but did not improve and was
admitted to the hospital. On admission her CXR was significant
for right sided pneumonitis. Patient was admitted and being
treated for CAP with levofloxacin and ceftriaxone when she
apparently decompensated from a respiratory standpoint on [**2-8**],
requiring intubation. At that point she had CT chest which
showed dense consolidation of RUL with b/l ground glass air
space disease throughout both lobes. Patient was put on
respiratory isolation for concern for TB and [**Month/Year (2) 11381**] x2 sent, fist
one [**2125-2-6**] came back negative.
.
While at the OSH patient also developed ARF with Cre going from
2.7 on admission to 5.5 on day of transfer. Renal was consulted
and felt could be secondary to volume depleation from diarrhea.
She underwent renal U/S at OSH which was negative. She was
started on bicarb gtt for treatment of metabolic acidosis. On
[**2-9**] patient started on steroids and pentamidine given concern
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 11091**]. She also become hypotensive at OSH and was started
on neo and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Also during admission at OSH patient found to have 7mm left
posterior parietal hemorrhage on head CT without mass effect.
She was seen by neurosurgery at OSH who felt hemorrhage unlikely
after repeat head CT showed no change in mass. Patient also
noted to have severe sinusitis.

.
[**2125-2-9**] CXR: 1. Right upper lobe consolidation, likely
pneumonia.
2. Moderate interstitial abnormality is likely pulmonary edema,
though viral pneumonia is also possible.
3. Possible mediastinal lymphadenopathy - recommend Chest CT for
further evaluation on a nonemergent basis.
.
[**2125-2-11**] CXR: Markedly improved airspace process in the right
upper lobe and mildly improving interstitial edema.
.
[**2125-2-12**] MR HEAD: 1. Abnormal FLAIR sulcal hyperintensity ,
differential includes any leptomeningeal process. In a patient
with HIV, meningitis is not excluded and correlation with lumbar
puncture is recommended. Also, contrast enhanced study could be
performed if patient's renal function improves, or hemodialysis
can be arranged.
2. A 6 mm lesion within the left occipital cortex, which may
represent a meningioma, but is incompletely characterized. A
hemorrhage in this area is not entirely excluded, and short
interval followup with non-contrast CT was recommended.
3. Pansinus opacification.
.
[**2125-2-12**] CXR: Cardiac size is top normal. ET tube is in the
standard position. NG tube is in the stomach. Right subclavian
vein catheter terminates in the cavoatrial junction. There has
been mild interval worsening of mild-to-moderate pulmonary
edema. Right upper lobe consolidation is stable. Ill-defined
right lower lobe perihilar opacity is new. This could be due to
asymmetric pulmonary edema, but infection cannot be completely
excluded.
.
[**2125-2-12**] SPINAL FLUID: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
                      Lymphocytes and monocytes.
.
[**2125-2-13**] CXR: Mild improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema
as well as the previously noted right upper and lower lung field
consolidations.
.
[**2125-2-13**] EEG: This is an abnormal EEG due to the right greater
than left
central sharp waves, the bursts of generalized slowing and the
slow and
disorganized background rhythm. The first two abnormalities
suggest
dysfunction of deep subcortical midline structures, while the
slow
background suggests a m
