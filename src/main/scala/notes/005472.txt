History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11367**] is a 68yo man with h/o COPD, LLL lung adenocarcinoma,
chronic respiratory failure, PE s/p IVC filter, CHF, VAP who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ER from his long term rehab facility after
his trach tube was foundto be loose and falling out today
associated with high airway pressures of 60s-70s. He was
otherwise without complaint and was afebrile.  In the ER he was
seen by respiratory therapy who pushed his trach tube back into
place with immediately resolution of airway pressures to the
20s.  Shortly thereafter the patient became hypotensive to 60s
systolic with HR 97. He was given 2L NS to which he responded
with return of his BP to the 110s.
.
In the ER the patient received a total of 4L NS. blood cultures
and UA were sent.  He was given vancomycin. He was admitted to
the ICU for monitoring and for bronch by interventional
pulmonology tomorrow morning.
.
Notably the patient was in the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU about two weeks ago at
which time his trach tube had been changed from a #6 to a #8
Bovina.  He was also diagnosed at that time with Pseudomonal
pneumonia and was treated with a course of vanco, cefepime,
Flagyl, which he has completed.
.
Per conversation with the pt's daughter and HCP, she has seen
her father pulling on his own trach tube many times and believes
that he pulls it out. Per her description he appears to be at
his baseline pleasant, interactive but somewhat confused
baseline.
.
ROS: pt unable to answer specific questions to this effect at
this time
.

CXR [**2159-9-30**]:
1. Tracheotomy tube tip just at the thoracic inlet,
approximately 8 cm from the carina, similar in position compared
to prior study from [**2159-9-10**].
2. Similar sized left lung mass.
3. Similar appearing left retrocardiac opacification consistent
with atelectasis and/or consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo man with h/o cOPD, recent pseudomonal pneumonia,
longstanding trach on ventilation presents with dislodged trach
tube, high peak airway pressures which resolved with
manipulation of tube and elevated white count as well as
transient hypotension in the ER.
.
1.  Respiratory failure: likely secondary to dislodged trach
tube. Pt's respiratory distress resolved upon physical resetting
of the trach tube while he was in the emergency department.
Bronchoscopy was done later and the trach tube was advance to a
better position.  Of note, a small air leak from his trach cuff
was discovered, but it is not significant enough to comprimise
his respiratory status.  Intervention pulmonology did not feel
this needed further workup.  His vent settings during this
hospitalization was: assisted control with fiO2 of 40%, 550mL x
22, PEEP 5.  (His vent setting at rehab prior to admission was
SIMV, RR 16, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.)  He recieved ipratropium and
albuterol inhalers standing and prn for copd, as he was getting
prior to admission for his COPD.
.
2. Hypotension: Pt had a transient episode of hypotension to SBP
of 60's in the emergency department after his trach tube was
position.  It resolved quickly in about 30 minutes with fluid
rescucitation.  He received a total of 30 minutes.  The
hypotension was initially suspicious for sepsis, but later
thought likely to be secondary to auto-PEEP from his vent.
Urine cultures and blood cultures were sent and were still
pending at time of discharge.  He was covered with antibiotics
empirically for sepsis: vancomycin for MRSA and zosyn for gram
+/- and pseudomonas.  Please note: patient was discharged on
these two antibiotics.  Please follow up on final results.  If
negative, should be able to discontinue vancomycin, and zosyn
after 7 days (last day [**2159-10-7**]).
.
4. UTI: pt with positive UA. Sent urine for culture and will
follow. On zosyn which should empirically cover.  Last day of 7
day course: [**2159-10-7**].
.
5. DMII: his blood glucose was controlled with an insulin
sliding scale and qid fingersticks.
.
7. oral thrush: nystatin swish and spit qid.
.
8. HTN: will give pt's home dose of metoprolol 50mg po bid.
.
9. Nutrition: per nutrition consult,  he received Probalance
Full strength with Beneprotein 35 gm/day at goal of 60ml/hr.
Residual were checked q4h and held for residual >= :100 ml.
Flushed w/ 150 ml water q6h
.
10. PPX: lansoprazole, heparin SQ given h/o PE, pneumoboots.
