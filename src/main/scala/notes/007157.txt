IMAGING:

Admission CXR [**1-7**]: IMPRESSION: Resolving right lower lobe
pneumonia. Persistent left lower lobe opacity.

Repeat CXR [**1-9**]: FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been
obtained with patient in semi-upright position. Apparently a
very poor inspirational effort accounts for the high positioned
diaphragms resulting in markedly crowded appearance of the
pulmonary vasculature on the bases. In the accessible mid lung
fields in apical areas, there is no evidence of any vascular
congestion nor is there any acute infiltrate or pneumothorax.
Available for comparison is a previous similar portable
examination of [**2125-1-7**] at which time the patient makes
a significant better inspiration with clear diaphragms but a
persistent left lower lobe opacity unchanged since the next
previous examination of [**12-7**]. It was also felt that there
existed some densities in the right lower lobe which were
interpreted as resolving opacities.

The present examination cannot make any statements regarding
these basal findings because of the patient's poor inspirational
effort. It is recommended the portable examination is repeated
if possible by adding also a lateral view.

EGD [**1-7**]:
Findings: Esophagus:
 Lumen: A large size hiatal hernia was seen.
 Protruding Lesions There were 2 cords of grade II varices at
the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the esophagus.
They were not actively bleeding. There was no stigmata of recent
bleeding, however due to the patient's hypotension and Hct of 18
on presentation, ligation was performed. 2 bands were
successfully placed.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Mosaic appearance of the mucosa with no bleeding was
noted in the whole stomach. These findings are compatible with
portal gastropathy. There was no active bleeding in the stomach.

Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Large hiatal hernia
Mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal
gastropathy
Varices at the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the
esophagus.

No active bleeding in stomach or esophagus.

Due to Hct drop and hypotension on admission, 2 bands were
placed on the esophageal variceal cords.

Recommendations: Can take sips of clears for dinner tonight. If
Hct remains stable on next blood draw, OK to leave ICU to floor.
Continue pantoprazole, octreotide. Hold nadolol for now.
Follow serial Hct.
Repeat EGD in 2 weeks with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7306**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7307**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1586**]

Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo F with h/o cirrhosis secondary to EtOH abuse c/b varices,

no h/o SBP, h/o recurrent C. Diff colitis, and depression/PTSD
presented with melena.
.
# GI bleed. The patient was scoped in the ED by the liver
service. Received 5 units PRBC's and 2 units FFP.  She was
banded in the ED and sent to the ICU for monitoring.  Octreotide
drip was initiated and continued for 5 days.  PPI IV was given
(GTT -> [**Hospital1 **] -> QD).  Nadolol was initiated in setting of
hypertension and GIB.  The pt initially had a groin cordis
placed in the ED for volume as access was difficult.  EJ was
placed and the cordis was removed.  HCT remained stable
thereafter.  The patient no longer required ICU level care after
HD #2, however no floor beds were available.  The pt remained in
the ICU for the remainder of her hospitalization and was
discharged home with stable HCT in stable condition with no sign
of bleeding with VNA and f/u instructions.
.
# EtOH cirrhosis. Received 2 units of FFP on arrival.
Thereafter she received no more.  She was started on CIWA
precautions, but received no PRN benzo
