Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchcoscopy


History of Present Illness:
82 yo female from [**Hospital **] Rehab in [**Location (un) 583**] admitted following
acute respiratoy decompensation and pneumothorax. The patiet was
admitted to the CCU between [**10-9**] - [**11-9**] for complete heart
block s/p pacer placement. Her long ICU course was c/b
hypercarbic resp failure requiring prolonged intubation and
trachestomy and PEG placement, new afib, CHF with diastolic
dysfunction, and contraction metabolic alkalosis. In mid
[**Month (only) **] she was transferred to [**Hospital3 105**] for long term
weaning of ventalitor. She had been doing well reportedly from
her son - slowly weaning with periods of up to 12 hours of
breathing without the ventalitor. She had been eating and
working with PT to walk.
    The pt had been doing well at rehab. The attending physican
ther, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30084**], reports that she had been spending some time
without the ventaliator. She had been treated for staph
bronchchitis with a course of Augmentin which was finished 1 - 2
weeks ago. During the last few days, she had been accumulating
fluid for an unknown reason. No recent fevers.
    In the ED she was given Lasix 40 IV, Azithromycin 500, Zosyn
4.5, and dopamine for a BP in the 80's. Blood cultures were
taken. CXR preformed which showed a 10 - 15% PTX on left. CT
surgery consulted in the ED.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Eval for PTX with upright chest xray

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with AVR and CHB with trach and peg, sent for
PTX
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval for PTX with upright chest xray
INDICATION: 82 y/o with reported pneumothorax at rehab post
chest tube placement.

PORTABLE UPRIGHT FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH. Comparison [**2169-11-23**].

FINDINGS:

There has been interval worsening of CHF pattern in both lungs
with increased alveolar and interstitial markings. In addition,
there appears to be an increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
An underlying consolidation at the right lung base cannot be
excluded. No pneumothorax is identified on this radiograph.
There is likely a left sided pleural drainage catheter with its
tip at the left lung base.

The tracheostomy tube, PEG tube, and left sided pacemaker are
all unchanged in position.

IMPRESSION:

Interval worsening of CHF and possible new right lower lobe
infiltrate. No pneumothorax is seen on this study. Left sided
pleural based catheter.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. PTX: The patient had a PTX at [**Hospital3 105**] temporally
replated to a bronch, but not likly caused by it. She likely had
a bleb that burst with air trapping. She had a chest tube place
at [**Hospital1 **] and here has been stable. CT surgery followed her
progress. As of [**1-4**], her air leak was closed and her lung was
reinflated by CXR. The chest tube was pulled by the ICU team
prior to discharge.  Follow up CXR showed no evidence of
pneumothorax.

2. Resp Distress: She has had an acute decompensation due to
mucous plugging. Bronch at the [**Hospital1 **] revelaed tracheomalacia
with dynamic collapse and right lower lobe obstruction.
Bronchoscopy was repeated in the ICU, and showed no evidence of
tracheomalacia, but dynamic collapse throughout likely related
to her COPD; as well as evidence of friable mucosa.  Continued
chest PT, Azithromycin and Zosyn for possible pneumonia as seen
on chest x-ray. Sputum cx and blood cultures were negative to
date. Pt is discharged back to [**Hospital1 **] for further attempts to
wean onto trach collar. She is continued on the Zosyn and
Azithromycin antibiotics.

3. CHF/MR: From clinical history and her physcial exam, she
appeared to be in failure. She continued to be diuresed, albeit
gently given her history of metabolic alkalosis, and her
persistent hypotension.  She was initially started on dopamine
drip for pressure support, but was eventually weaned off the
drip.  On discharge, her CT continued to show evidence of
pulmonary edema, and she was continued on PRN Lasix with goal
I/O of negative 1 L/day as her BP tolerated.

4. Decrease in Hct: The patient's Hct slowly decreased over a
few days after admission, from 37 to 33 to 29.  Retic count was
3.0%, with elevated LDH and haptoglobin of 103.  There was no
evidence of hemorrhage, and this drop was thought to likely be
secondary to some dilution with the IVFs given for hypotension.
It can continue to be followed on discharge, with furth
