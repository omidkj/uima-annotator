Service:  Vascular Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
obese white male with a history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who, in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year, was found to
have an abdominal aortic aneurysm measured at 5.9 cm.

The patient presents for an elective abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair.  The incidental finding was during a cardiac
angiography done at [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital.  The patient
denies any claudication, rest pain, abdominal pain, or back
pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history is significant
for)
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Coronary artery disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history is significant
for an umbilical hernia repair in [**2140**] and a right inguinal
hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was obese,
in no acute distress.  Vital signs were stable.  The chest
was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart was
regular.  The abdomen was soft and nontender.  There was a
small palpable hernia lateral to the umbilicus which was
reducible.  There was no expansile mass.  Bilaterally, distal
pulses were intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Preoperative
laboratories were significant for a hematocrit of 50.  INR
was 1.1.  Blood urea nitrogen was 17, and creatinine was 1.1.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Preoperative imaging included
an angiography which showed a severely angulated abdominal
aorta with aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal aorta.

Preoperative electrocardiogram revealed sinus with a left
shift.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission, the patient went
to the operating room and underwent an open abdominal aortic
aneurysmal repair and incisional hernia repair.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated
postoperatively and transferred to the Vascular Intensive
Care Unit after an uneventful recovery in the Postanesthesia
Care Unit.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable during the
postoperative period requiring no pressor support.  The
patient was maintained on an epidural for the first three
postoperative days with adequate pain control and was
transitioned to subcutaneous and oral pain regimens.  The
patient's wound remained clean, dry, and intact.  He
completed a course of perioperative antibiotics.  The
patient's distal pulses remained intact, and the patient was
evaluated by Physical Therapy and was ambulating without
difficulty at the time of discharge.

On postoperative day four, the patient's diet was advanced,
and the patient has since had flatus and a bowel movement.

The patient's laboratory values were significant for a drop
in his platelet count, and a heparin-associated
thrombocytopenic antibody was sent which was still pending.
The patient had been off of heparin since then, and his
platelet count has since stabilized.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was stable and ready for
discharge to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm; now status post repair.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Medications on discharge
included)
1.  Tylenol No. 3 one to two tablets p.o. q.4h. as needed.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice per day times two weeks and as
needed thereafter.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in 7 to 10 days for staple removal.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.
