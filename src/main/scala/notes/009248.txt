Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
The patient is an 83-year-old gentleman referred to the thoracic
clinic for newly diagnosed esophageal cancer.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-11-20**] - minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83-year-old gentleman referred to the thoracic
multidisciplinary clinic by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for an evaluation
of newly diagnosed esophageal cancer.  The patient states that
he has had gastroesophageal reflux disease for many years that
he had self-medicated by milk and over-the-counter antacids.  In
the setting of a knee infection five years ago, he underwent a
surveillance endoscopy that according to the patient showed
[**Last Name (un) **] esophagus.  No endoscopic followup was recommended by the
gastroenterologist; however, this past month the patient's
primary care physician upon reviewing his medical record
recommended a followup
endoscopy.  The patient did undergo an endoscopy at [**Hospital 27034**] Hospital that showed long segment Barrett's of
approximately 12 cm in length.  Random biopsies were taken
during this endoscopy that showed multiple areas of high-grade
dysplasia with a focus of adenocarcinoma.  The patient was then
referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] here at [**Hospital1 827**].
 A repeat upper endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound was
performed.  During that procedure, Barrett's esophagus was noted
to 26 cm from the incisors, an the area of ulceration of the
esophageal mucosa was noted proximally in the mid thoracic
esophagus.  Endoscopic ultrasound revealed a mass at this area
that involved the musculus propria.  There were two small but
suspicious appearing periesophageal lymph nodes and therefore
endoscopic ultrasound stage was T2N1.  Of note, biopsy nor FNA
of the suspicious lymph node was performed during this
procedure, as the lymph node was adjacent to the area of mucosal
abnormality.

Subsequently, the patient underwent a PET CT scan here at [**Hospital1 18**],
performed [**2120-10-19**].  The CT showed no obvious mass in esophagus.
There was noted to be some mildly increased uptake in the mid
esophageal region.  There was an 8 mm precarinal lymph node that
was not FDG avid.  However, there was noted to be a mass in the
left upper quadrant adjacent to the splenic flexure with an SUV
of 17.5.  There was noted to be significant inflammatory change
in the fat surrounding this mass.  In addition there was left
iliac node with an SUV of 33.4.  There was no evidence of FDG
uptake in the lung or liver on this recent PET CT scan.
Currently, the patient reports that he feels quite well.  He
does
have symptoms of reflux but he has no dysphagia, odynophagia.
He does disclose that he lost 8 pounds of weight over the past
two weeks.  He feels that this is more likely related to loss of
appetite given the recent diagnosis of esophageal cancer.  He
has no other complaints at the current time and states that he
feels to be otherwise in very good health.

valve regurgitation, carotid artery stenosis bilaterally, benign
prostatic hyperplasia.


Social History:
He currently lives at home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is retired.  He
states that he is quite active at home and gardens outside

UGI AIR W/KUB  [**2120-11-27**] 11:25 AM
TECHNIQUE/PROCEDURE: Scout image demonstrates JP drain and
staples overlying the left neck. Vascular calcifications are
present. Water soluble Conray contrast followed by thin barium
was administered orally. Contrast passes freely through the
esophagus into gastric pull-through with no evidence of
obstruction or contrast extravasation at the upper anastomosis.
Degenerative changes are noted involving the cervical spine.

IMPRESSION: Status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through
without evidence upper anastomotic leak.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2120-11-29**] 8:54 AM
Additional interval decrease in right apical pneumothorax is
demonstrated. The amount of the right subcutaneous emphysema is
unchanged. The post-esophagectomy mediastinal contours with
creating of the new esophagus are stable. The lungs are clear.
The pleural surfaces are smooth and there is minimal amount of
pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of post-surgical chest.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1024**] was admitted on [**2120-11-20**] and underwent successful
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, minimally invasive esophagectomy
with cervical esophagogastric anastomosis and feeding
jejunostomy catheter placement.  He taken to the PACU and
monitored prior to transferring to the intensive care unit with
a chest-tube and neck JP drain.  On POD #1 he was extubated and
transfer to the floor.  He remained in stable condition.  He had
good pain control with an epidural and dilaudid PCA managed by
the acute pain service.
He had continued in this fashion until POD#3, at which time both
his epidural and foley catheters were removed as well as his
nasogastric tube.  His nutritional requirements were met through
tubefeeding, with appropriate increases in rate/quantity at this
time.  Over the short term of his hospital course, these tube
feeds were able to advanced readily to goal without any
interruption.  His chest tube drainage was consistently
non-chylous, with a barium swallow demonstrating no evidence of
a leak.  Furthermore, the patient was advanced to a full liquid
diet, which he was able to tolerate exceptionally well.
Throughout the entire post-operative course patient demonstrated
an exceptionally positive attitude and truly participated in his
own care.  He was evaluated by the thoracic surgery as being
stable for discharge, requiring lovenox bridging therapy for
coumadin anticoagulation with INR checks by his PCP/coumadin
clinic.  These outpatient needs were established for the patient
by the Thoracic Surgery Team.
