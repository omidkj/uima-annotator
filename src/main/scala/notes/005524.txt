Admission Date: [**2113-4-23**]        Discharge Date: [**2113-4-25**]

Service:  NME


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In summary, this is a 60-year-
old woman with history of pineocytoma diagnosed in [**2108**]
status post removal in [**2109-8-16**], status post removal
of bleeding into the residual tumor and placement of a right
ventriculoperitoneal shunt in [**2109-8-16**], who was
initially diagnosed in [**2108**] after she developed right ear
tinnitus and gait imbalance.  She had slowing word finding
difficulties and a change in the quality of her voice.

She eventually had a MRI, which showed a 2 cm by 2 cm by 2 cm
pineal mass and had it resected.  Resection was complicated
by hemorrhagic stroke in presumably the right posterior
temporal region as well as a thalamic pain syndrome.  This in
turn was complicated by hydrocephalus and a VP shunt was
placed.

She was admitted to Neurosurgery last in [**2112-6-14**] and x-
ray irradiation was offered at that time for the enlarging
tumor.  The family declined this and the patient was sent to
the nursing facility for palliative care.  She returned in
[**2112-12-15**] for lethargy and was found to have a urinary
tract infection.  She was discharged after she was thought to
be back to baseline.

She saw a neuro-oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] in followup in
[**Hospital 746**] Clinic, and he communicated to the family that
he does not feel that further radiation, surgery, or
chemotherapy would be helpful at this time.  Since then, the
patient had a gradual decline in energy with also the ability
to communicate.

One week prior to this admission she was able to nod yes and
shake her head no appropriately and occasionally to get
single words out.  On the Wednesday prior to this admission,
a visiting nurse felt that her lungs sounded "junky" and
levofloxacin was prescribed.  There have been no fevers.
Possibly her urine has had ammonia-like smell recently.
Otherwise, she is tolerating her tube feeds via J tube
continuously.  Today she was much less responsive and could
not be woken up by her family.  They noticed that her pupils
were not reacting.  Of note, they have noticed that most
times that her head is turned towards the right and eyes are
turned towards the right.  They had noticed occasionally
rhythmic twitching of the right foot.  She is doing none of
these currently at the time of admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Pineocytoma as above.
2. Hypertension.
3. J tube for feeding.
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.


MEDICATIONS:
1. Roxanol for pain.
2. Reglan.
3. Lactulose prn.


ALLERGIES:  She has an allergy to Dilantin, which causes a
rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She was a nonsmoker, no alcohol or drugs.
She worked formally 20 years for the U.S. Department of Labor
in [**Location (un) 86**].  Has many family members in the area, and her
daughter, [**Name (NI) 32634**] is the healthcare proxy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, she was afebrile.  Her
temperature was actually hypothermic at about 94.5.  Her
blood pressures fluctuated from the systolics of 70s to
systolics of 130s.  Her heart rate was bradycardic anywhere
from the high 20s to 50s.  In general, was ill appearing,
lying in bed with a face mask on.  Her mucous membranes were
moist.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Her heart was regular with no murmurs.  Abdomen was soft.
Her J tube site was clean.  Extremities showed no pedal edema
or rashes.  On mental status, the patient was unarousable to
voice or sternal rub.  There was no blink to threat
bilaterally.  The pupils are 4 mm and nonreactive.  At rest,
the right eye is deviated to the right and the left eye is
midline.  The oculocephalic maneuver revealed extraocular
movements that were intact laterally.  There were no corneal
reflexes and a gag was depressed, but did elicit a slight
response.  She had tone that was normal in all four
extremities.  There was slight withdrawal to painful stimulus
in all four extremities and no adventitious movements.  Her
coordination could not be tested.  Deep tendon reflexes were
present and symmetric.  Her sensory exam was intact to
nailbed stimulation in all four extremities.  Her gait and
stance could not be tested.

Her imaging CAT scan revealed a very large pineal tumor that
had an enlarging appearance with a resultant edema,
hydrocephalus and effacement of the sulci.  The rim of the
hyperdensity surrounding the central portion of the tumor
could represent a rim of hyperdense tumor, which was pushed
outside approximately 5.5 by 5.5 cm in size, which is an
enlargement.

She was initially monitored in the ICU where she was
breathing spontaneously.  Her family and daughter mainly said
that she was a full code.  She was stable and was transferred
to the floor.  After discussions with the Ethics Committee
and the family, it was decided that she could be intubated,
but not to have any resuscitation efforts or CPR.  This was
so to allow other family members to arrive.

On hospital day number three, she became very hypoxic and had
agonal breathing.  She was intubated and transferred to the
ICU.  The Ethics Committee was again consulted who felt that
it was appropriate to be intubated, however, just only until
the family was able to arrive, and then they can say goodbye.

On the evening of [**2113-4-25**] at 9:30 p.m., the patient had
a cerebral blood flow scan done which showed no cerebral
blood flow, which suggested brain death.  Her clinical exam
showed that she had lost her extraocular movements.  She had
no corneals.  Her brain stem function was nil.  She had no
withdrawal to pain.  She was extubated and the time of death
was 9:30 p.m. on [**2113-4-25**].  Her daughter, [**Name (NI) 32634**] and
family members were at her bedside.
