elevated troponins.  At that point, a cardiac catheterization
was recommended, but the patient refused.  She went home from
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital and returned the following day with

She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 **] for cardiac cath, as

NEURO EXAM:  Nonfocal.

STUDIES:  She also had an echocardiogram on [**2156-5-18**] which
revealed mild left ventricular enlargement with moderate to
severe impairment of the left ventricular systolic function,
and an estimated LVEF of 25-30%.  There was akinesis of the
mid and apical portion of the septum.  There was mild
thickening of the mitral valve leaflets and annulus, with
moderate to severe MR, and mild tricuspid insufficiency.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  So, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] where she underwent an emergency cath which
revealed that the left main had a small filling defect.  The
LAD had ostial proximal subtotal stenosis with decreased
flow, and they felt there was a clot in the left main
coronary artery.  The left circumflex had diffuse moderate
disease.  The RCA was proximally occluded with distal vessels
filled by LCA collaterals, and aortography showed diffuse
atheromatous disease of the aorta and significant disease in
the left iliac.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] was consulted and took the patient for an
emergency CABG x 2 with LIMA to the LAD and reversed
saphenous vein graft to the OM, and a mitral valve
annuloplasty with a #26 [**Doctor Last Name 405**] band.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on
milrinone and epinephrine.  She remained intubated overnight
and was extubated the following day.  She remained
hemodynamically stable, and her epi was weaned off on the
first day.  Postop day #2, her milrinone was weaned and then
DC'd on postop day #3.  On postop day #3, her chest tubes
were DC'd.

She continued to slowly progress, and on postop day #4 she
was transferred to the floor in stable condition.  She had
her wires DC'd on postop day #5 and was very slow with
ambulation, and slow to progress.  She was followed as well
by [**Last Name (un) **] and had her insulin changed to Lantus with still
Humalog sliding scale.  She also had a white count of
13-16,000, and had an echo on postop day #7 which showed no
vegetations.  All of her cultures were negative, and she was
discharged to rehab in stable condition.

LABS ON DISCHARGE:  White count 14,700, hematocrit 30.7,
platelets 376,000, sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride
98-232, BUN 18, creatinine 0.9, blood sugar 143.
