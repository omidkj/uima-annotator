Pathology Examination #[**-4/3312**] [**2158-10-16**]
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Mediastinal pleura (AA):
Lung parenchyma with chronic inflammation and fibrosis.
No malignancy identified.
2.  "Part of thymus and anterior mediastinum" (A-E):
Adipose tissue with focal collection of macrophages, many
ladened with carbon pigment.
3.  Endobronchial tumor (F):
Non-small cell carcinoma (see synopsis).
4.  4R, node (G-H):
One lymph node, no malignancy identified.
5.  Right lung, pneumonectomy (I-P):
Non-small cell carcinoma (see synoptic report).
Vascular and bronchial margins are free.
Uninvolved lung shows collapse with hemorrhage and chronic
inflammation.
6.  Ribs (Q-R):
Bone and marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2158-10-24**] 7:15 PM
1. Evidence of viscus perforation with free air seen in the
right lower quadrant. Fat stranding and a small amount of free
fluid are also seen in the right lower quadrant. There is
possible pneumatosis of the cecum. Findings are consistent with
a perforated cecum likely due to ischemia.
2. Scattered diverticula seen throughout the remainder of the
colon without frank diverticulitis.
3. Marked distention of the cecum measuring up to 10 cm. There
is also distention of the ascending and transverse colons. There
is no evidence of obstruction.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2158-10-24**] 5:06 PM
Right subclavian vein thrombosis. Limited examination, as above.
The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time
of the exam.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2158-10-24**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.

3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is a small pericardial effusion.
8. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2158-9-15**],
there has been no significant change.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2158-11-6**] 8:03 AM
1. Slight increase in the size of the left pleural effusion.
2. No evidence of pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19641**] was admitted to Thoracic Surgery on [**2158-10-16**] for an intrapleural, intrapericardial pneumonectomy with
serratus muscle flap bronchoscopy and mediastinal lymph node
dissection.  For details of the procedure, please see the
operative report.  Upon completion of the operation, the patient
was sent to the MICU as a border for hypotension.  His course in
the MICU was significant for afib/flutter which was controlled
with verapamil and quinidine.  Of note, the patient was
extubated in the OR but which subsequently failed requiring
re-intubation.  He was then extubated the following day without
issue thereafter.  In the MICU, EPS interrogated his AICD after
noting rare PVCs.  Then on POD#3 he was found to be stable
enough and was then transferred to the floor.

On POD#4, patient was seen by EPS for an occurrence of
A-flutter; was refractory to metoprolol and was then treated
with digoxin and diltiazem which converted patient's rhythm to
sinus.  The digoxin and diltiazem was then subsequently
discontinued with no need to start any antiarrhythmics at that
time.  However, on POD#7, patient was noted to have A-fib and
was started on quinidine 324mg (1.5 tabs PO Q8hrs), a heparin
drip and coumadin for anticoagulation.

Furthermore, on POD#7, patient began having changes in mental
status, complaining of abdominal pain and distention and had
need of increased fluids.  Despite having a completely benign
exam and a white blood cell count within normal, he did have an
elevated creatinine and lowered systolic blood pressure.  The
patient was then moved to the ICU, a cardiac echo was done, a
general surgery consult was obtained and the patient was made
NPO and had a nasogastric tube and arterial line placed.  An
abdominal CT showed free air within the right upper quadrant
with significant inflammation/stranding about the cecum/appendix
and questionable distention of the right colon.  His abdominal
exam also worsened at that point and general surgery was
concerned about possible a perforated appendix, colonic ischemia
secondary to the A-fib, or a perforation secondary to [**Last Name (un) 3696**]
syndrome; an exploratory laparotomy was suggested and discussed
with the family who agreed and wished to proceed.

On [**2158-10-25**] patient underwent the exploratory laparotomy but was
found to have no gross evidence of perforation.  It is believed
that the patient suffered a microperforation resulting in free
air but which had subsequently healed.  He was then taken to the
SICU.  On [**2158-10-26**] was restarted on a heparin drip, amiodarone
and also extubated.  On [**21
