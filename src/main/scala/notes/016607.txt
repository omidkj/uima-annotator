carotid stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2101-7-19**] Left carotid endarterectomy
[**2101-7-20**] Cardiac catheterization
[**2101-7-22**] Balloon pump
[**2101-7-22**] Tandem heart+ECMO and high risk PCI with 2DES to the LAD

History of Present Illness:
71 year old female with PMH COPD on home oxygen, HTN,  PVD s/p
b/l Fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bipass who is pod #1 from Lt CEA.  Immediately post
operatively she was hypotensive requiring neosynephrine ggt for
several hours and received ~5L IVF.  She was very transiently
weaned of the neosynephrine to bp's in the high 90's but then
decompensated again in the early am hours requiring retransfer
to the PACU and reinitiation of neosynephrine. CXR performed
showed pulmonary edema and she received 20IV Lasix with some
good relief.
.
On initial evaluation, she was feeling somewhat better. She only
complained of some shortness of breath. She didn't have any
chest
pain or pressure.  We did a trial of BIPAP which she didn't
tolerate, and on re-evaluation ~1-2 hours later she began
feeling
nausea with chest burning and worsening dyspnea. ECHO was
performed which showed, "severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the setpum,
inferior, inferolateral, distal 2/3rds of the anterior and the
apical walls." Given changes on ECHO patient was taken to the
cardiac cath lab for evaluation for ACS versus demand ischemia.
.
In the Cath lab, he was noted to have elevated filling pressures
with PA pressures of 48/29 and mean wedge of 32 and diffuse two
vessel disease with 90% LAD, 80% proximal Lcx and occluded
distal and 30% Left main prox with nondominant RCA.  She was
given IV lasix 120 x 1 with UOP of 600 cc.  She was also noted
to have subclavian stenosis with 10-20 mm Hg gradient.  Swan was
left in place to measure PA presures.  No intervention was done
and she was tranferred to CCU for monitoring and CT surgery
evaluation for CABG.
.
On cardiac review of symptoms, prior to arrival to the hospital
she denies any chest pain, sob, orthopnea, doe.  She does use
home oxygen. She isn't very active due to hip pain. All other
ROS
negative.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

[**7-25**] ECHO The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25%), with
some regional variation, most consistent with multivessel CAD.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There is a
trivial circumferential pericardial effusion, outside of a
rather large anterior fat pad. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
.
[**7-22**] TTE: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse
process. Mild mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2101-7-20**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly reduced.
.
[**7-24**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-24**], the
monitoring and support devices remain in place. The degree of
pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased, especially on the
right. The central pulmonary vessels and hila are also much less
prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
71F with PVD (fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass and AAA repair) post-op from CEA
who suffered NSTEMI complicated by acute systolic heart failure
and flash pulmonary edema requiring emergent balloon pump
followed by tandem heart and high risk PCI [**7-22**] ultimately made
CMO after failure to wean from cardiopulmonary support.

Vascular Surgery Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service under
the care of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She underwent an uncomplicated left
carotid endarterectomy. In the PACU on POD 0 she became
hypotensive and required starting a neo ggt as well as
resuscitation w 5 L of crystal. She then became acutely hypoxic
and was administered IV lasix after a CXR demonstrated pulmonary
edema. A stat cardiac consult was done and an Echo obtained. The
echo showed diffuse ventricular disfunction. The patient was
intubated in the PACU and taken ungently to the cath lab. The
cath showed multivessel dx and the patient was transfered to the
cardiac ICU for further work up and treatment.
