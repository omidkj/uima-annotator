History of Present Illness:
75 year old male with CAD s/p MI and CABG, CHF (EF 20%), and
Aflutter, admitted [**2-24**] w/AFib s/p ablation, admitted from [**Hospital **]
rehab for hemoptysis.
Pt coughed up sputum this am after waking (normal for him) but +
blood clots, x 5 today, totaling [**1-20**] cup.
Feels congestion in chest and coughing up blood, rather than
blood from nasopharynx or emesis.  Chest CT today showed chronic
PEs, mucoid impaction in right bronchus, and unchanged
mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy.  No specific tx was
given in ED.  Pt was admitted for further eval given his
comorbidities.
.
Pt had repeat episode this am, one tsp of bloody clots.

Hematocrit and Cr were stable during this admission.
.
ECG: V paced at 79 bpm, LAD with RBBB pattern
.
ECHO: [**2-24**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction
20-30 percent).  The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. The ascending aorta is
moderately
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in  the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis. No  aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.  There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid  regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate
pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2149-1-28**], no major change is evident.
.
Chest CT [**5-27**]: 1. Evidence of chronic thromboembolic disease and
pulmonary hypertension with pruning and narrowing of distal
branches. IVC filter noted on scout image. 2. Right hilar mass
which encases a pulmonary artery and appears to slightly
compress the right bronchi. Slightly increased attenuation
material within the bronchi is seen -- while this may represent
mucoid material or thrombus, invasion of a malignant tumor into
the bronchus cannot be excluded. 3. Left flank hernia involving
a small portion of the descending colon. 4. Right adrenal
nodule, which cannot be further characterized on this
examination. 5. Prominent ascending aorta with dense
calcification.
.
CXR [**5-27**]: 1. Unchanged appearance of emphysema and chronic lung
disease. 2. Slight increase in probable left pleural effusion.
3. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Cardiomegaly.
.
CXR: [**2149-5-30**]:
INDICATION FOR STUDY: Right hilar mass with hemoptysis, status
post bronchoscopy, evaluate for any interval change.

Comparison made to prior radiographs from [**2149-5-27**]. Cardiac
pacing lines in satisfactory positions. Again seen is a right
hilar mass. The lung volumes are low, with consolidation now
noted in the right lower lobe. These features are superimposed
on emphysema and chronic lung disease. The left pleural effusion
is again noted and not significantly changed. The retrocardiac
space is obscured and consolidation cannot be excluded in this
region.

IMPRESSION: New right lower lobe and probable left lower lobe
consolidation in this patient with a right hilar mass.
.
[**5-31**]: Biopsy of R lung mass:
Lung, right lower lobe, biopsy:

Organizing hemorrhage and scant bronchial tissue with squamous
metaplasia; no malignancy identified.
.
[**2149-6-1**]: CXR:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to chest films since
[**5-27**], most recently [**6-1**] at 11:08 a.m.

Progression of small foci of consolidation in the right upper
lobe over the past three days, most likely pneumonia. Small
right pleural effusion and right basal atelectasis unchanged.
Mild interstitial edema and moderate cardiomegaly stable. Right
ventricular pacer defibrillator and right atrial and ventricular
pacer leads unchanged in their respective positions.
.
[**2149-6-4**]; CXR:
FINDINGS: Pulmonary edema continues. Bilateral pleural effusions
are unchanged as well as bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable. The patient is status post
CABG.

IMPRESSION: Continued pulmonary edema.
.

[**6-5**]: Right lower lobe, transbronchial biopsy:

a. Bronchial mucosa with distorted atypical cells suspicious for
large cell carcinoma, see level 1 recut.

b. Fibrinous exudate in alveolar spaces.

Note:  Immunoperoxidase studies for cytokeratin are not
contributory
.
[**6-5**]: IR Procedure:
IMPRESSION:  No active bleeding was identified doing right
pulmonary artery arteriogram and right brachial artery
arteriogram.No abnormal arteries identified
.
[**6-10**]: IR Embolization:
FINDINGS:  Right fifth intercostal arteriogram demonstrates a
patent artery with no evidence of blood supply to the lung.  The
right sixth intercostal artery origin from t
