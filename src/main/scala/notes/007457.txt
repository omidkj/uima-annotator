Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**]
Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**10-18**]: Right Crani for Mass resection


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 44263**] is a 72 y/o male in previously good health who began
to notice left hand weakness approximately 2 weeks ago.  He
states the hand felt clumsy, and then noticed progressive
weakness in the left arm and also left leg.  Over approximately
the same time period, he complained of bifrontal headaches for
which he took over the counter pain medications with some
relief. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2153-10-14**] from an OSH
where he was evaluated for weakness.  A head CT without contrast
revealed a right frontal intraaxial hypodensity with
approximately 1.2 cm of frontal midline shift toward the left.

participate with pronator drift testing. He did not understand
what was being asked of him. Simple commands were followed
without difficulty.

Labs on Discharge:
Dilantin 9.1.

Imaging:
MRI Head [**10-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Multiple brain lesions, the largest one being in the
right
frontal lobe which involves the corpus callosum. Differential
diagnostic
considerations include GBM with metastatic spread versus
intracranial
metastatic disease from non-CNS primary.

CXR [**10-17**]:
FINDINGS: No previous images. Mild hyperexpansion of the lungs
with slight
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Some prominence of
interstitial
markings could reflect chronic lung disease, elevated pulmonary
venous
pressure, or both. However, no evidence of acute pneumonia or
pleural
effusion.

Head CT [**10-18**]:
MPRESSION:
1. No acute hemorrhage. Post-surgical changes consistent with
frontal
craniotomy.
2. Improvement of midline shift to the left when compared to
prior scan.
3. Previously identified right temporal lobe lesion not clearly
identified on today's CT scan.

MRI Head [**10-20**]:
Status post resection of right frontal lobe tumor with air-fluid
level in the surgical cavity. Residual enhancement is seen
around the surgical cavity and unchanged appearance of the right
temporal lesion identified. No acute infarct or hydrocephalus.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 72 y/o male in previously good health who began
to notice left hand weakness approximately 2 weeks prior to
admission.  He states the hand felt clumsy, and then noticed
progressive weakness in the left arm and also left leg.  Over
approximately the same time period, he complained of bifrontal
headaches for which he took over the counter pain medications
with some relief. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2153-10-14**]
from an OSH where he was evaluated for weakness.  A head CT
without contrast revealed a right frontal intraaxial hypodensity
with approximately 1.2 cm of frontal midline shift toward the
left. On [**2153-10-18**], he underwent an uneventful surgical
resection of the lesion. He was maintained overnight in the ICU
for observation, and subsequently transferred to the
neurosurgical floor. He was then evaluated by both physical and
occupational therapy, who deemed him to be an appropriate
candidate for rehab. The patient had low a dilantin level so he
was bolused and his maintenance dose was increased. He also had
an extra dose on [**2153-10-25**] for a corrected level of 9.1. On
[**2153-10-25**] he was discharged to a rehab facility with instructions
to follow up as noted earlier in this document.
