CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Elective prostate biopsy in the setting of
anticoagulation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year-old
male with a past medical history significant for a
[**Known lastname **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] prosthetic mitral valve and atrial fibrillation

in the past who presented as a direct admission for prostate
biopsy scheduled for [**2149-2-20**] in the setting of

He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,
loss of consciousness, abdominal pain or bright red blood per
rectum.

exertion and occasional feeling of head tightness, occasional
dry cough and occasional loose stools for several years.

admission.  2.  Toprol XL 200 mg po q.d.  3.  Zestril 40 mg
po q.d.  4.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d.  5.  Multi vitamins.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for diabetes mellitus, myocardial
infarctions and cancer, pancreatic.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife, quit tobacco in
[**2136**]. Drinks occasionally.  He has three children.  He
retired in [**2143**], he was a job planner in a private company.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Significant for stable
vital signs.  General, no acute distress, pleasant and
talkative.  Extraocular movements intact.  Anicteric sclera.
Oropharynx clear.  Neck was supple, right greater then left
carotid bruits.  Heart regular rate and rhythm.  Mechanical
S1.  Regular S2.  Loud 3 out of 6 systolic murmur heard
across the chest.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally
with no wheezes, rhonchi or crackles.  His abdomen was
protuberant with positive bowel sounds, nontender.
Extremities were significant for trace pitting edema, 1+
pedal pulses bilaterally.  Neurologically he was alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.
Full strength and sensation throughout.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 5.8,
hematocrit 33.3, platelets 133, PT 19.8, INR 2.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on a heparin drip
on his admission and his Coumadin was held in anticipation of
the prostate biopsy.  He underwent an uncomplicated prostate
biopsy on the morning of the 17th two days after admission.
At this time his INR was .1 and .3, which was considered
sufficiently low for the procedure.  Again the procedure was
uncomplicated and he was restarted on his heparin drip six
hours post procedure.  He was restarted on his outpatient
dose of Coumadin with a goal INR between 2.5 to 3.5, which is
his normal outpatient goal range.  On the 20th three days
subsequent to his biopsy he had an episode of bright red
blood per rectum.  At this point his INR was 1.4, PTT 83.  He
had 300 to 400 cc of lower gastrointestinal bleed, bright red
blood without stool.  He had a subsequent five to six
additional episodes each one with approximately 300 cc of
bright red blood.  Symptomatically he felt anxious, but
denied any lightheadedness, dizziness or shortness of breath.
His heparin was stopped.  Gastroenterology and
interventional radiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and he was transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

He received a mesenteric angiogram by the Interventional
Radiology Service looking for evidence of an acute rapid
bleed.  This was negative.  He additionally had a colonoscopy
the following day, which was again unrevealing for bleed, but
was notable for mild colitis of the splenic flexure.  In the
intervening time he received 3 units of packed red blood
cells, although his hematocrit had dropped only three points.
Given the negative results of the angiography and the
colonoscopy it was felt that the most likely etiology of his
bleed was prostatic in the setting of his biopsy.

Two days subsequently he was called out of the Medical
Intensive Care Unit to the floor in stable condition.  Given
these complications cardiology was asked to comment on
anticoagulation in this difficult setting given his past
history of cerebrovascular accidents off anticoagulation.
His heparin was initially held for approximately 24 hours on
the basis of this recommendation and then restarted with a
lower target range.  His new target PTT was approximately 60
with an average goal of 40 to 50.  Throughout his subsequent
stay his PTT was maintained in this range.  Additionally a
tagged red blood cell scan was obtained, which was negative
as well.  In addition, hematology was asked to comment on
appropriate management of this anticoagulation and they felt
that a goal PTT was appropriate.  On the 22nd he had a repeat
episode of bright red blood per rectum, which required
transfusion of an additional two units of packed red blood
cells.  He had no further events of this sort.  His
hematocrit remained stable.  The subsequent day his heparin
was again restarted given the risk of stroke.  One day
following this he was restarted on his Coumadin.  His INR
rose slowly over the subsequent days.  He was maintained
between 7.5 to 10 mg of Coumadin.  Finally on the [**1-9**] his INR reached 2.6, his heparin was discontinued
and he was felt to be stable to be discharged home.

The results of his prostate biopsy were essentially negative,
but significant for a missing R5 apex specimen and a LV based
specimen with a single atypical glandular focus with a small
angulated glands, crystalloids and rare nucleoli.  It was
noted that while some of the diagnostic features of carcinoma
were present that they were not conclusive.  These results
will be followed up by his regular urologist.

At the time of discharge Mr. [**Known lastname **] had no further
bleeding for approximately one week.  He was not orthostatic.
His INR was 2.7.  He had no recent complications.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post prostate biopsy.
2.  Prostatic bleeding.
3.  Mechanical mitral valve.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  As upon admission.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with his
regular primary care urologist.
