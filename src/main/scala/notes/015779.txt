Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 22964**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization, with 2 drug eluting stents placed in
the mid-left anterior descending artery.

History of Present Illness:
70 yo M with PMH of HTN, HLD and recent admission (d/c
[**2189-3-7**])for syncope attributed to orthostasis without
appropriate heart response secondary to medications and beta
blockade who presented to ED with four days of worsening SOB,
chest fullness, diaphoresis. Normally has excellent exercise
tolerance and walks 3 miles a day, but over last several days,
becaome SOB just walking in his house. He reports no antecedent
symptoms such as fever, chills, or recent URI. He denied sputum
production or cough at the time of admission. Triggered on
arrival for tachycardia to 154 and found to be in AF with RVR.
.
In the ED, initial VS 96.8 154 143/99 24 97% RA, received iv
dilt with good hr response and got dilt 60mg po x1. Labs with
metabolic gap acidosis, lactate normal, normal WBC with slight
left shift, BNP >21,000, trop 0.03 with normal CK. CXR with
large RML infiltrate, treated with CTX and azithro for CAP. VS
prior to transfer. 1L IVF. EKG with flipped Tw v2-v6. Developed
worsening hypoxia and O2 requirement increased to 4L nc,
crackles on exam, got 20iv lasix. VS prior to transfer: 98.2 102
138/97 92% on 2L, 89%L on RA.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
.
He was subsequently found to have TWI on his ECG on the lateral
leads and he underwent ECHO to determine whether or not need
needs to undergo emergent Cath. He does not have a previous Echo
in the [**Hospital1 18**] system.
.
Upon evaluation on the floor, he endorsed the history given
above but became acutely short of breath and desated to the mid
80's during a rectal exam, and became cyanotic. He was sat
upright with an improvement in his O2 sat to the low 90s. His HR

CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
.
1. Moderate right and small left lower lobe consolidations,
consistent with pneumonia.
2. Medial ground-glass opacity, smooth gravity dependent
intralobular septal thickening and bilateral pleural effusions,
consistent with pulmonary edema.
3. Coronary arterial calcification.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrates single vessel disease. The left anterior descending

contains a long 90% lesion in the mid-vessel. The left main
contains no
angiographically apparent disease, and circumflex contains minor
disease
only. The right coronary is a small non dominant vessel that is
free of
angiographically apparent disease.
2. Hemodynamics demonstrate a low cardiac output with elevated
biventricular filling pressures.
3. Successful PTCA/stenting of mid LAD with overlapping 2.5 X 18
mm and
2.5 X 23 mm PROMUS DES, post dilated to 2.75 mm with NC balloon
at high
pressure. (details under PTCA comments). Final angiogram showed
0%
residual stenosis in the stent, no dissection and normal flow.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Successful PTCA/stenting of mid LAD with overlapping PROMUS
DES.
4. Aspirin 325 mg daily for 1 month, then 81 mg daily
5. Plavix 75 mg daily for > 3-6 months as tolerated.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal
two-thirds of the ventricle and preservation of the basal septum
and inferior walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve is mildly thickened (?#) with no aortic stenosis or
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
