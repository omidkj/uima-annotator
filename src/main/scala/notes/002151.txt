CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Right upper and right lower lobe pneumonia.
3. Consolidation in the left lower lobe.
4. Sideports of the NG tube located at the level of GE junction.
.
TTE: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

.
Abd xray: FINDINGS: One vew of the abdomen on spine position
demonstrates no evidence of bowel loop dilatation. No evidence
of obstruction. Unremarkable bowel gas pattern.
.
PORTABLE CHEST: Endotracheal and NG tube have been removed. A
right internal jugular line is unchanged in position. Previously
noted asymmetric increased interstitial opacity diffusely
throughout the right lung may be slightly any improved compared
to three days prior. Left lung appears grossly clear. There is
no evidence of effusion. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 55 y/o female with breast cancer and new right middle and
lower lobe PNA.
.
#. Hypoxia/Right Lower Lobe PNA: Patient admitted to MICU and
intubated, required pressors briefly.  Was extubated on [**4-1**] and
did well.  No PE on CTA.  No evidence post obstructive disease.
Treated with vancomycin and zosyn with azithromycin on admission
and received 6 days here (3 days azithro).  On room air at time
of discharge.  Intubated. Hypoxia likely due to airspace disease
(PNA) on top of poor lungs (smoking history). No PE on CTA.
Negative cardiac enzymes. TTE repeated and unchanged from
previous (normal).  At time of discharge plan to change to
levofloxacin for 14 day course total.  Patient should get repeat
CXR to see resolution of infiltrates in [**3-10**] weeks.  Seen by
swallow specialists here and no abnormality found; can continue
regular diet.  Still unclear why two recent episodes of
pneumonia, although in different locations by report.  Can
continue to investigate as outpatient.
.
#. Hypotension: Combination sepsis and hypovolemia.  Had [**Last Name (un) 104**]
stim test with appropriate bump and appropriate am cortisol.
This can be repeated in outpatient setting if desired.  TFTs
also normal and normal TTE.
.
#. Breast Cancer: No evidence of lung metastasis.  D/w patient's
oncologist and will get outpatient follow up.  Continued on
aromasin while here.  Patient did complain of lower back pain
but appears to be chronic issue with negative bone scan last
fall.
.
#. Schizoaffective Disorder and Mood Disorder:  Followed by
psychiatry here and medications adjusted as outlined.  Initially
in ICU patient very agitated when extubated but became calm and
redirectable (with bouts of yelling) after transfer to floor.
No prolonged QTc on EKG on haldol.  Lithium level 0.9.  Also on
depakote so LFTs should be followed as outpatient.
.
#. h/o Liver disease: Labs show preserved synthetic function and
LFT's not elevated.
.
# h/o chronic constipation:  Continued zelnorm and miralax.
.
