IMAGING:
[**2147-5-19**] CXR: Cardiomegaly and moderate bilateral pleural
effusions with pulmonary vascular congestion is concerning for
congestive heart failure. An underlying infection is not
excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.

[**2147-5-24**] CXR: Supine portable chest radiograph was obtained.
Bibasal atelectasis and likely effusions are increased with
unchanged engorgement of the central pulmonary vasculature.
Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged without findings of edema.

[**2147-5-29**] CXR: 1. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement without
evidence of pulmonary edema.
2. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
with
accompanying bibasilar atelectasis.  In the right clinical
setting, pneumonia within the lower lobes cannot be excluded.

[**2147-5-20**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of hypertension, asthma, and
prior CVA who presented with shortness of breath. Patient had a
complicated hospital course with MICU admissions for respiratory
distress and treated for HCAP, influenza and asthma
exacerbation. Given patient and family's stated wishes for
comfort-focused care, palliative care was consulted and patient
was transitioned to home hospice.

# Goals of care discussion: patient and family requested
palliative care consult yesterday, with question about hospice
program. Seen by palliative care consult, referral to home
hospice made by case management. Discussed with the patient
further about hospice and what it means. Patient understands
that hospice means symptomatic management of her illness and not
trying aggressive curative measures which may cause discomfort,
and it may mean shorter life here and she is in agreement with
that philosophy. She reports that she [**Last Name (un) 103360**] wants to be in the
hospital again, and that she wants to be taken care of by her
24-hour caregiver at home and pass at home. She was enrolled and
discharge on home hospice.

# Shortness of Breath: Patient was empirically treated for HCAP
with vancomycin and cefepime from [**Date range (1) 44596**]. She was also treated
for asthma exacerbation with nebs and prednisone 60mg daily.
Additionally, there was felt to be a component of pulmonary
edema so she was diuresed with IV lasix. On [**5-26**] her respiratory
viral culture returned positive for influenza B so she was
started
