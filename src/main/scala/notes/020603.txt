Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizzineness, status post fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Femoral temporary venous pacer
2. A line
3. PPM (DDD) placement


History of Present Illness:
84 y/o F with severe AS (0.8), chronic lymphoma, DVT on
coumadin, asthma who p/w falls X 1 month.  Also had one episode
of "fainting" one week ago.  Came to ED for fall.  Admitted to
medicine floor.  Noted to have 8 sec run of non-conducted P's
(assymptomatic).  Baseline ECG reveals bifasicular block with
prolonged PR.

Came to CCU for CHB.  Recieved 3U FFP.  Attempt at RIJ for temp
wire unsuccessful.  Pt became hypotensive requiring max dose
dopa and neo gtt's.  Intubated for airway protection.  R fem
temp wire placed successfully under flouro.  Pacing at 80 BPM's
with threshold 0.4mAMP set at 10.  Coming down on pressors.  Due
to ventricular ectopy, weaning dopa first.

Past Medical History:
1) Aortic stenosis: last echo [**6-16**] with EF > 55%, severe AS
(worse than prior echo)
2) Rheumatoid arthritis (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Rheum, on
methotrexate)
3) asthma
4) HTN
5) LLE DVT

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2148-12-3**] 10:49 AM
CONCLUSION
1. Moderate size hematoma in the subcutaneous tissues of the
right groin. No pelvic or intra-abdominal hematoma.
2. Large hernia containing two separate segments of colon.
3. Mild circumferential thickening along part of the ascending
colon partly located within the abdomen and within the right
inferolateral abdominal wall hernia with mild adjacent stranding
compared to previous CT. No sign of mechanical obstruction.
Possibilities would include an area of focal segmental
congestion or even colitis depending on clinical correlation.
4. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 3.9 cm
transverse unchanged.
5. Moderate right basal pleural effusion and minor associated
right posterobasal atelectasis.
6. Cholelithiasis.

ECHO [**2148-12-2**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left
ventricular chamber size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is probably
borderline normal (EF~50-55%) but views are technically
suboptimal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (estimated [**Location (un) 109**] ~0.6 cm2 but LVOT
velocity estimation is technically limited) . There is no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is a 84 year old female with severe AS (0.8), chronic
lymphoma, DVT on coumadin, asthma who p/w s/p fall and complete
heart block. Now s/p DDD pacer.
.
#Cardiovascular -
#Ischemia - no previous history of ischemia. Continued on ASA
325.
# Pump - Recieved 3U FFP. Attempt at RIJ for temp wire
unsuccessful. Pt became hypotensive during attempt at RIJ temp
wire requiring max dose dopamine and neosynephrine gtt's.
Hypotension was thought to be secondary to increased vagal tone
with pressure and manipulation at the RIJ. Patient was intubated
for airway protection in setting of right neck hematoma. Patient
was subsequently weaned off pressors. Repeat ECHO showed
preserved EF 50-55%, tight AS valve area 0.6 cm2. Patient became
hypotensive and required fluid boluses and resumed on dopamine
ggt temporarily after removal of right femoral sheath and right
groin hematoma was seen on CT. Patient was resumed on diltiazem
and was diuresed with IV lasix with goal of -500cc/day.
# Rhythm - Noted to have 8 sec run of non-conducted P's
(assymptomatic). Baseline ECG reveals bifasicular block with
prolonged PR. Admitted to CCU for CHB. Received temp wire in R
groin under fluoro. Patient had PPM (DDD) placed on [**2148-12-3**].
.
##Respiratory - S/P Intubation for airway protection given
hematoma in neck. Initially propofol used for sedation, however
was changed to fentanyl and versed with better effect. Patient
was extubated sat'ing well on room air. Continued advair,
ipratropium and albuterol NEB PRN.
.
##Hematomas - Patient developed multiple hematomas at access
sites including RIJ, left forearm, right groin and left chest
(pacer site). Bleeds stopped with pressure bandages, FFP and vit
K. Abdominal CT showed right groin bleed and no RP/intrapelvic
bleed. Anticoagulation was held and patient was transfused as
needed.
.
## AS:  Severe with area of 0.8, mean gradient 50's. CT surgery
was consulted and spoke with patient who said that she does not
wish to go to surgery at this time.
.
## UTI:  Enterococcus 100K, PROVIDENCIA RETTGERI 10-100K on ucx.
Was on vanco 1g for 48 hours perioperatively. Completed 1 week
of ampicillin for Entercoccus UTI and levoquin 4 days,for GN
coverage.
.
## Anemia: Labs consistent with iron def anemia. Started PO iron
repletion. In an elderly with iron def. anemia concerning for GI
origin and should have outpt workup.
Patient received blood after decreased Hct after RIJ attempt, R
femoral groin cordis removal and left chest hematoma at pacer
site. Hct now stable and patient off coumadin.
.
## [**Name (NI) 14572**] - Pt with h/o dvt (dx'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**2148-6-12**]) and
anticogulated with coumadin on admission, INR was 2.5. Coumadin
was held and patient was put on heparin gtt.
Patient received FFP prior to central line placement and after
right groin bleed. Patient also received vit K prior to PPM
placement and s/p right groin bleed and heparin ggt was held.
Initially patient was started on coumadin with heparin bridge
however had pacer bleed and so coumadin and heparin were held
given bleeding risks.
.
## Falls:  Likely [**2-14**] CHB.  Head scan negative.  PT consult,
will need to go to rehab.
.
## PPX: colace/senna PRN
