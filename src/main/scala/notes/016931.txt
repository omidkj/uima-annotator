Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Penicillins / Levaquin in D5W

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute ischemia of the left lower extremity, left lower extremity
ischemia and rest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-6-11**] - left femoral thromboembolectomy, vein patch
angioplasty

[**2163-6-12**] - Arteriogram of the left lower extremity, Primary
stenting of the left superficial femoral and above-knee
popliteal artery, Balloon angioplasty of the left peroneal
artery, Perclose closure of the right common femoral
arteriotomy.


History of Present Illness:
This unfortunate 75-year-old lady was transferred from [**Hospital1 10151**] Center. She is ventilatory-dependent and had a
stroke and is noncommunicative, but was noted to have a cool
pale left lower extremity prior to admission. She was
heparinized. A CT angiogram was done which suggested embolus and
some thrombosis of her superficial femoral artery. She was
admitted and underwent emergent Left femoral thromboembolectomy
with vein patch angioplasty on [**2163-6-11**]. Her superficial femoral
artery was occluded all the way down to the above-knee popliteal
artery where it reconstituted through collaterals in the
profunda femoris artery. After undergoing embolectomy she did
not improve, and her foot continued to be threatened. She was
take to the OR for left lower extremity arteriogram on [**2163-6-12**]
with primary stenting of the left superficial femoral and
above-knee popliteal artery with balloon angioplasty of the left
peroneal artery.

anxiety, multiple hernia repairs, colostomy, h/o MRSA, C.diff,
Pseudomonas, VRE

Per records, positive for CAD.


Physical Exam:
VITALS:  Afebrile, vital signs stable.
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. EOMI. PERRL. Nares clear.
Mucous membranes moist. Neck supple without lymphadenopathy.
CVS: Regular rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
S1 and S2. No evidence of carotid bruits. Trach tube in place
for chronic ventilatory needs.
RESP: decreased breath sounds to auscultation bilaterally
without adventitious sounds. No wheezing, rhonchi or crackles.
ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended, with normoactive bowel
sounds. No masses or peritoneal signs.
EXTR: The right lower extremity is warm well-perfused and is
without erythema, drainage or edema. The left lower extremity is
warm well-perfused and is with mild reperfusion changes that are
stable, mild erythema, but without mottling or changes in pulse
exam (below).
PULSE EXAM: Left PT dopplerable, R DP/PT dopplerable signals
(monophasic)

[**2163-6-11**] CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC RUNOFF W: Widespread severe
atherosclerotic disease as outlined above including occlusion of
most of the left superficial artery. Abdominal aortic aneurysm,
stable in size and measuring up to 41 mm. Mixed sclerotic and
lytic appearance of bones without discrete lesions, possibly
reflecting a metabolic abnormality; correlation with laboratory
testing and consideration of bone mineral density screening are
suggested when clinically appropriate. Irregular appearance of
each femoral head, potentially related to avascular necrosis.
Large ventral hernia containing most of the solid organs and
bowel.


Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV pain medication in
the immediate post-operative period and transitioned to PO
narcotic medication with adequate pain control on POD#[**1-30**]. The
patient remained neurologically stable from previous exams; of
note she is non-communicative and withdraws to pain, on exam.
She is without change from baseline.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient remained hemodynamically stable
intra-op and in the immediate post-operative period. Their
vitals signs were closely monitored with telemetry in the
cardiovascular ICU.

The patient did well following their vascular procedures. The
patient was closely monitored with serial pulse exams in the
post-op period. If appropriate, doppler signaling was frequently
assessed in the involved extremity. Their post-op pulse exam
demonstrated dopplerable signals of the left lower extremity
DP/PT. The patient was placed on a heparin gtt for
anticoagulation once she was admitted, given the concern for
acute ischemia, and was bridged to oral Coumadin. Their PTT was
assessed every 6 hours (PTT goal 60 - 80). The patient was
started on Coumadin 3 mg PO daily on [**2163-6-13**] and this was
increased to 5 mg PO daily, which was her dosing on discharge.
She continues to bridge from heparin gtt to Coumadin. She needs
INR monitoring.

RESPIRATORY: The patient remained chronically vented with
respiratory support and intermittent episodes of CPAP were
maintained. The patient had no episodes of desaturation or
pulmonary concerns. The patient denied cough or respiratory
symptoms. Pulse oximetry was monitored closely and the patient
maintained adequate oxygenation.

GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient was NPO following their procedure.
The patient experienced no nausea or vomiting. The patient was
transitioned to her regular tube feeding regimen of Novasource
at 60 cc/hr continuous, following her procedures, after a
Dobhoff tube was replaced. IV fluids were discontinued once
adequate Dobhoff tube feeds were established.

GENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was closely monitored
in the immediate post-operative period. A Foley catheter
remained in place on admission, and the patient was able to
successfully void without issue. The patient's intake and output
was closely monitored for UOP > 30 mL per hour output. The
patient's creatinine was stable.

HEME: The patient's post-op hematocrit was stable and trended
closely. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and
received transfusion of 4 units of packed red cells with
favorable response. The patient's coagulation profile remained
normal and was monitoring given her Coumadin dosing. The patient
had no evidence of bleeding from their incision.

ID: The patient showed no signs of infection and remained
afebrile in the post-op period. Their white count was stable
post-operatively and their incision was closely monitored for
any evidence of infection or erythema. The patient received only
standard peri-operative antibiotics, and did not require further
antibiotics post-op.

ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood glucose was closely monitored in
the post-op period with Q6 hour glucose checks. Blood glucose
levels greater than 120 mg/dL were addressed with an insulin
sliding scale.

PROPHYLAXIS: The patient also had sequential compression boot
devices in place during immobilization to promote circulation.
GI prophylaxis was sustained with Protonix/Famotidine when
necessary. The patient was discharged in stable condition to her
acute ventilatory rehabilitation facility.
