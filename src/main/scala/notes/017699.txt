Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Latex / Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain/pressure/nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization [**2107-7-1**] with bare metal stent to mid left
anterior descending artery and thrombectomy to proximal left
anterior descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
54yo female with h/o CAD s/p PCI with stenting of first diagonal
and proximal LAD in [**10/2102**], HTN, and hyperlipidemia who
presents now after emergent cardiac cath for STEMI with stent
thrombosis of LAD stent.

Patient had outpatient surgery earlier today for nasal polyp
removal. Had been holding aspirin about 2 weeks prior to
procedure. On driving home, developed nausea and bilateral arm
pain. Pain radiated to her left jaw, and she then developed [**6-18**]
substernal chest pain as well as SOB.  Her husband pulled the
car over, called 911, and the patient was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
via ambulance. In ambulance patient received aspirin and SL
nitro without improvement in symptoms.
.
Initial VS: HR 50, BP 140/80. On arrival to ED VS were 47 144/78
18 and 100% on non-rebreather.  Patient was fatigued but alert
and oriented x3.  ECG revealed ST elevations in I, AVL, V1-V3,
V4-6. Code STEMI called. Guaiac negative. Patient was started on
heparin bolus and gtt, integrillin.  She was bradycardic and had
pacer pads placed on chest, but did not require pacing.  She was
brought emergently to the cath lab.

In cath lab, was found to have stent thrombosis in proximal LAD
stent. Large clot was removed via aspiration thrombectomy, and
stent was dilated by balloon angioplasty.  She also had a BMS
placed in the mid-LAD. While in the cath lab, she was on a
bivalirudin drip, was continued on integrillin, and also was
loaded with 60mg Prasugrel.  She tolerated the procedure well
and was transferred to the CCU for further management.
.
On arrival to CCU, VS: 95.9 72 128/71 14 100% on oxygen face
mask 6L. Patient was chest pain free and denied any
lightheadedness, SOB, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, pain at
right groin site, or leg pain. She c/o mild headache which she
felt was secondary to her flat position in bed.
.
She has h/o CAD and underwent PCI with stenting of first
diagonal and proximal LAD (DES) in 11/[**2101**]. She was on Plavix
following the procedure, but has been off Plavix now for
approximately two years.  She has not had any cardiac
interventions since that time, but did undergo a stress test
about 2 weeks ago prior to her nasal surgery which by patient's
report was unremarkable.  SHe has been off ASA for the last two
weeks prior to the surgery today.

Prior to today, she has not had any recent episodes of CP at
rest or on exertion. She has had some SOB, secondary to her
nasal polys.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias,
cough, or hemoptysis. She denies any recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. Positive for recent chest
pain, SOB, and nausea as above.

Reports
Cardiac Catherization [**2107-7-1**]:

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiogrpahy in this right dominant system
demonstrated acute
thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD stent. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease. The mid LAD had 70-80%
stenosis after
the diagonal branch which had a patent stent. The LCx had 50%
stenosis
in the mid vessel. The RCA had 60-70% mid to distal stenosis
with TIMI 3
flow.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial
systolic
hypertension with SBP 154 mmHg. Following reperfusion the
patient
transiently developed an accelerated idioventricular rhythm
without
hemodynamic compromise and then reverted to sinus rhythm.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Very late stent thrombosis of the proximal LAD.
2. Mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
3. Transient reperfusion-related accelerated idioventricular
rhythm.
.
[**2107-7-1**] EKG
Sinus bradycardia. ST segment elevation in leads I, aVL and
V1-V6 consistent with myocardial injury/acute myocardial
infarction. Downsloping ST segments in the inferior leads with T
wave inversion could be reciprocal changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2102-10-31**] the ST segment changes are new and
ventricular rate is slower.
.
[**2107-7-2**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid
to distal anterior septum, anterior wall and lateral wall. The
apex is dyskinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Extensive regional LV systolic dysfunction
consistent with prox
