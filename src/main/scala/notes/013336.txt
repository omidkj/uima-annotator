Brief Hospital Course:
42 yo woman with anxiety and asthma exacerbation.
.
1. Asthma exacerbation: Multiple triggers for this: URI,
cigarette smoking, started on propanolol recently.  Patient was
not intubated on this admission.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] ICU,
she appeared to be improving clinically, saturating at 98% on 5L
nasal canula with a peak flow of 300.  She did appear to have a
worsening exacerbation a few hours later, causing her to
desaturate to 89% on room air, at which point she was given
nebulizer treatment and increased to 50% oxygen on high flow
mask.  A CTA of chest showed no PE, but sig for central and
sublpleural peribronchial predominently ground-glass opacities
in the upper lobes concerning for cryptogenic organizing
pneumonia.  Patient ultimately improved without antibiotics and
prednisone taper. Upon transfer to the floors, pulmonology was
consulted and given her quick clinical improvement did not think
further evaluation for COP was necessary.  Patient was continued
on steroid taper, advair, nebs. Upon discharge, patient nolonger
required oxygen and ambulatory O2 sats were stable.
.
#. Hx Substance Abuse: Initially patient was placed on CIWA
precautions and clonidine for possible residual withdrawal.
Patient did not show any signs of withdrawal and CIWA was d/c'd.

ativan prn. SW was also consulted and patient stated she wanted
to continue her care w/ her new PCP at [**Hospital1 2177**], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 39008**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11463**]), who specializes in addictions. Patient also made
follow up w/ outpatient methadone clinic.
.
#. Depression/Anxiety: Propanolol (started at Bornewood) was
discontinued as possible exacerbation of respiratory distress.
Patient was continued on citalopram and oxcarbazepine (also new
medications started in [**Hospital1 **]).  Per psych, patient was
given ativan prn for anxiety and trazadone for sleep.  Patient
was discharged w/ followup with close follow up PCP and plans to
receive group treatment at methadone clinic.
