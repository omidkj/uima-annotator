Chief Complaint:
transfer to MICU for tachypnea, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated ([**2173-2-11**])
A-line ([**2173-2-11**])


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with two vessel CAD, COPD, CVA and
hypertension who was presented to [**Hospital1 18**] Ed with worsening
dyspnea over the previous few days.
.
Per the patient's fiance, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has difficulty breathing at
baseline. He was previously weaned off of supplemental 02 while
in rehab and is not on O2 at home. His breathing markedly
worsened 3-4 days prior to admission. He did not experience any
symptoms of cold; denies cough, fever, chills, sputum
production, nausea, and vomitting. He was very constipated and
took miralax this morning following which he had "incredible
diarrhea."
.
On day of admission, patient was noted by VNA to be short of
breath while standing and talking, with wheezes and rales on
pulmonary exam. [**Hospital3 **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the
patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Of note, his weight had been
stable at home, oxygenating 93% on RA when seen by VNA.
.
Initial vitals in the ED were as follows: Temp:97.8 HR:84
BP:147/84 Resp:18 O(2)Sat:99. Subsequently he desated to mid-80%
and triggered. Patient received azithromycin, solumederol, and
combivent x3 in the ED (last doses at ~1pm). A CXR and CT Chest
demonstrated no acute intrathoracic process and unchanged
emphysematous changes particularly in the right lung; there were
no signs of PE. An EKG was concerning for new TWI in V2-V4 and
Troponin was elevated to 0.08. Cardiology was not consulted. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] stabilized with on O2 sat of 97% on 4L NC and was
transfered to the medical floor.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was 93% on 4L with marked
tachynpea (~60 breaths/min) with a nine beat Vtach run. He was
tachycardic to 130-140s and hypertensive to SBP170-180s. The
patient received Lasix 40mg IV, combivent neb X2, morphine 1 mg
IV. A Foley was placed with good urine output. EKG demonstrated
no changes when compared to those from the ED. ABG showed pH
7.33; pC02 38; p02 83, HCO3 21. Repeat ABG at 1 hr showed pH
7.37; pCO2 35, pO2 79, HCO3 21. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the
MICU for further care.
.
In the MICU, he reports slight improvement in his breathing. He
was alert and oriented to person, place and time. He did not
report chest pain, dizziness but does report shortness of
breath.

CXR ([**2173-2-11**]): The patient was intubated in the interim with
the ET tube being approximately 6 cm above the carina. In
addition to the known lucency of the left upper lung, there is
interval development of left pneumothorax, moderate with the
presence of deep sulcus sign. The right lung is unchanged and
the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, although slight
additional shift to the right is noted, most likely due to
pneumothorax.

CT Chest ([**2173-2-11**]): Large left pneumothorax persists. Large
left apical component causes resulting LUL atelectasis, with
second left chest tube now terminating in pleural air
collection. Left basilar catheter extending along fissure,
terminates above basal component of PTX. Increased left basilar
atelectasis compared to chest CTA the prior day. Expiratory scan
demonstrates
tracheobronchomalacia, with focal left lobwer lobe complete
bronchial
collapse.

CT Head ([**2173-2-11**]):
1. No evidence of acute intracranial process.
2. VP shunt in unchanged position
3. Left subdural collection is unchanged in size.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male two vessel CAD, COPD, CVA and hypertension who
was presented to [**Hospital1 18**] Ed with worsening dyspnea over the
previous few days.
.
# Acute respiratory distress: Initilaly thought to be flash
pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive emergency due to
ACS on the floor. His anginal equivalent for his two disease CAD
seems to be shortness of breath but no chest pain and V4-V6 as
noted by his stress test in [**2150**]. CTA negative for PE. CXR not
consistent with pneumonia. ABG and clinical presentation not
consistent with COPD exacerbation. Improved with nitroglycerin
gtt.  On [**2173-2-10**] around midnight, he was noted to be acutely
hypoxic and satting in 50%.  Anesthesia was called to intubate.
He was requiring 100% FiO2 and 10 cm PEEP with peak pressures
extremely elevated around 50 but pO2 only in 60s.  He was noted
to have left tension pneumothorax.  IP placed two chest tubes
with one tube showing persistent air leak.  There was concern
for bronchopulmonary fistula especially on [**2173-2-13**] when he was
noted to have worsening of his subcutaenous empysema tracking
down to his scrotum and up to his eyes.  IP placed a 14 french
pig tail catheter.  He was weaned down to 50% FiO2 and 5 cm PEEP
by [**2173-2-14**].  However he required increased FiO2 back to 70% on
[**2173-2-15**].  He continued to have significant air leak and
worsening subcutaneous emphysema.  Family meeting was held with
son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] on [**2173-2-15**], and decision was made to make patient
CMO.  ET tube removed at 4:30pm, and patient expired at 6:15pm.
.
# Two vessel CAD/Systolic heart failure: EF of 35-45% on TTE in
10/[**2172**].  Continued on asprin, metoprolol and high dose statin.
.

spiriva and albuterol nebs prn
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 25 mcg po qdaily
.
# BPH: Continued finasteride 5 mg po qhs
