Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute onset of dysarthria and right sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 47 year-old man with PMH only known to have Afib (on
Coumadin) who presents with acute onset of right-sided weakness
today.  The time of onset is
unclear from the transfer notes, but his initial Head CT was
performed at 20:00.  He was found to have a large left thalamic
hemorrhage, with extension and filling into the left lateral
ventricle and some blood in the right lateral ventricle, with
midline shift.  He was intubated at [**Hospital6 3105**].
He was found to have an INR of 1.8 (on coumadin for Afib), and
was given FFP and Vitamin K.  His SBP was approximately 200 and
he was given 10mg labetalol, with a drop in his HR to 56.  He
was medflighted to [**Hospital1 **], and on arrival he was on propofol for
sedation, and his pupils were found to  be fixed and dilated
bilaterally.

CXR:
Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.
Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.9 cm
above the level of the carina. Nasogastric tube is seen coursing
below the level of the diaphragm, distal aspect not included on
the images. There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities are
seen, which could be due to aspiration or infection. There is
also mild pulmonary vascular congestion. The cardiac silhouette
is mildly enlarged. No pneumothorax is seen. There is slight
blunting of the left costophrenic angle which is most likely due
to overlying soft tissue, though a trace pleural effusion cannot
be excluded.

NCHCT [**2137-1-26**]: Large left thalamic parenchymal hematoma with
intraventricular and subarachnoid extension. Moderate
surrounding edema and 8-mm rightward shift of midline
structures. Left uncal herniation and diffuse cerebral edema.
There is extension of parenchymal hemorrhage into the left
midbrain and that there is both downward transtentorial and
early cerebellar tonsilar herniation.

NCHCT [**2137-1-27**]: Large left thalamic intraparenchymal bleed with
surrounding edema and intraventricular extension, similar to the
prior study. Stable rightward shift of midline structures by
approximately 8 mm.
Stable left uncal herniation and diffuse cerebral edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 92479**] was admitted to the neuro-Intensive care unit for
the management of his anticoagulation-related left
intraparenchymal CNS hemorrhage. In the setting of this massive
hemorrhage, his admission neurologic examination was very poor
including dilated and nonreactive pupils, absent VORs or
corneals and a poor gag/cough. He was seen by neurosurgery who
deferred intervention given the poor prognosis overall. He
received one dose of 100g of mannitol, but this did not improve
his neurologic examination. His blood pressure was controlled
with a nitroprusside drip. He was seen by our supervising
physician the following day, and at that point he had been off
all sedating medications for almost four hours. He had no
spontaneous or purposeful movements, and his only intact
brainstem reflex was a low spontaneous breathing rate
(approximately [**8-9**]/min).

His family was made aware of the gravity of the situation. They
were emotionally overwhelmed, and asked for an extra day to make
their decision. In the interim, Mr. [**Known lastname 92479**] had problems with
low BPs (down to the 80s/90s systolic) and developed a new
elevated WBC with low grade fever, acute on chronic renal
failure (Cr 1.5-3.0) and became slightly oliguric. On the 30th
of [**Month (only) 404**], the daughter and wife of Mr. [**Known lastname 92479**] agreed to
switch to CMO status and we pushed ahead with a terminal
extubation. Prior to extubation, the priest was called to
perform a prayer. He was given 2mg of morphine as a palliative
measure. He passed approximately 45 minutes later. The family
declined autopsy.
