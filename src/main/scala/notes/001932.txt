PATIENT'S ANTICIPATED DATE OF TRANSFER IS [**2110-12-20**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 16 year old female
with a history of cystic fibrosis status post bilateral lung
transplants in [**2108-9-11**], who was admitted on [**2110-12-12**], following a rigid bronchoscopy with dilation and
Mitomycin application to reduce swelling and scar tissue in
the left main stem bronchus.  Shortly after application of
Mitomycin, the patient developed a stridor and was treated
with Albuterol and racemic epinephrine treatment before
transfer to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit for observation.

While in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient acutely
desaturated with a pulse oximetry of 60%, was given a
nebulizer treatment, non-rebreather mask and failed to
improve with hypoxia in a range of pAO2 of 44.  The patient
was on CPAP with a pressure support of 8 and PEEP of about 10
and FIO2 of 100, and her oxygen saturations improved to the
90s.  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for observation.

Initially, this was thought to be an allergic reaction to
Mitomycin and was treated with intravenous steroids, Benadryl
and Pepcid.  For the next 36 hours in the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, the patient could not be weaned off oxygen and
would acutely desaturation if the FIO2 dropped below 90%.
With the concern of her possible PE causing shunt, the
patient was intubated on the third day of hospital stay for a
CT scan.  The patient acutely desaturated with oxygen of 60s
while on the vent prior to having the CT scan.  Multiple
blood gases drawn showed pO2 in the 31 to 35 range.  The
decision was made for an emergent bronchoscopy at the bedside
where a mucous plug was discovered in the left main stem
bronchus.  Once removed, the patient's oxygen saturations
rapidly improved.

The patient was extubated the following day with oxygen
saturations in the 95 to 96% on room air.  She was observed
overnight and transferred to the Medical Floor.  The patient
was scheduled for a stent on Friday, [**2110-12-19**].

[**2108-9-11**].
2.  Asthma.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

.............and tobramycin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives in [**Hospital3 **].  Sister also
with cystic fibrosis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:
1.  Prograf 7 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Bactrim Double strength Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
6.  Neurontin 300 mg p.o. twice a day.
7.  Procardia 30 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Ultrase 7 to 8 with meals, 3 to 4 with snacks.
9.  Insulin NPH 32 units q. a.m.
10. Humalog 2 units q. a.m.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 101.6 F.; blood pressure
between 100 and 140 over 50 to 90; pulse between 70 and 145;
the patient's respirations between 20 and 30.  She was 96% on
room air.  In general, pleasant young female in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Moist mucous membranes.  No oropharynx
lesions.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi or crackles.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Bowel sounds are positive.
Extremities are warm, two plus dorsalis pedis pulses.  No
edema.  Neurological:  Answers questions appropriately.

LABORATORY:  On [**2110-12-19**], white blood cell count of
5.4, hematocrit of 26.7, platelets of 150, neutrophils of
64.7, lymphocytes 30.4, monocytes 3.4, eosinophils 1.0,
basophils 0.5.  Chemistry sodium 139, potassium 4.2, chloride
99, bicarbonate 27, BUN 18, creatinine 0.6, glucose 113,
calcium 8.9, phosphorus 3.6, magnesium 1.4.

The patient had a CT scan of the chest which ruled out
pulmonary embolism and showed diffuse air space and disease
in the right lung and left lower lobe consistent with
infection.  It showed parenchymal opacification around the
left lower lobe consistent with bleeding.  There were
multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilum,
consistent with post-infectious lymphadenopathy or with
secondary post-transplantation lymphoma.  A small right
pleural effusion.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 16 year old white female with a
history of cystic fibrosis status post bilateral lung
transplant now status post stent placement in the left
mainstem bronchus with a right middle lobe and left lower
lobe pneumonia, awaiting transfer back to the [**Hospital3 18242**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  The patient is now status post stent
placement with oxygen saturations in the mid-90s on two
liters.  Currently, the patient is continued on her
immunosuppressants including mycophenolate mofetil and
tacrolimus and she is on a Prednisone taper.  She should be
receiving 30 mg for the next two days, and 20 mg for the two
days after that, 10 mg for the two days after that and then
back down to 5 mg every day as her baseline dose.  It should
be noted that prior to the stent placement, the patient's
oxygen saturations continued to decline.  It was unclear
whether or not the patient was not appropriately hypoxic
vasoconstricting versus if she had a pulmonary embolism.  A
CT angiogram showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolism.

The patient was instructed to lay on her right side to help
with the ventilation perfusion match.  Post-stent placement
the patient now is saturating well.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient continued to spike
temperatures up to 101.6 F., after transfer from the Medical
Intensive Care Unit to the floor.  Pan cultures show the
patient has a likely source of pulmonary given the findings
on chest x-ray and follow-up CT scan.  At the time of
dictation, sputum Gram stain and culture were pending.  The
patient was started on Clindamycin for questionable
aspiration.  At the time of this dictation, the patient was
to be started on tobramycin, Ciprofloxacin and Vancomycin as
well although these are pending to be started upon her
transfer to [**Hospital1 **].

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient with a history of
pancreatic insufficiency.  The patient takes her own Ultrase,
pancreatic enzymes prior to meals and snacks.

4.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient with insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus.  Blood sugars have been completely out of control
given that the patient's p.o. intake has also been very
erratic.  The patient usually takes 32 units of NPH in the
morning with 2 units of Humalog.  These will need to be
adjusted according to the patient's p.o. intake.  She is also
covered with a Humalog insulin sliding scale.  We are just
covering with q.a.d. fingersticks and adjusting as necessary.

5.  OPHTHALMOLOGY:  The patient was seen by Ophthalmology
regarding blurry vision.  No pathology was seen on
examination.  It was determined that she likely has a
refractory error and they recommended follow-up as an
outpatient.

6.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had an echocardiogram while
she was at the [**Hospital1 69**].
Findings were consistent with right ventricular strain.
Question whether this is acute versus chronic.  A CT scan
showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.  The patient also
with status post new lung status post transplant, so it would
be less likely that it is a permanent pulmonary process as
usually right ventricular strain would improve with improved
lungs.  We would recommend a follow-up echocardiogram once
her acute issues have been treated.

7.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has been
very hypophosphatemic and hypomagnesemic treated with p.o.
Neutra-Phos and magnesium oxide.  Once the patient gets a
PICC line placed, we would recommend intravenous replacement.

8.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient has history of seizures,
questionable secondary to cyclosporin.  Would continue
patient on Gabapenti
