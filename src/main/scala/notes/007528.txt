Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath/Fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-5-17**] Cardiac catheterization
[**2162-5-19**] Minimally-invasive mitral valve replacement with
a size 27-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve


History of Present Illness:
58 year old gentleman with no prior history of mitral valve
regurgitation who developed what he thought was a pneumonia
three weeks ago. He noted being short of breath with orthopnea
and severely fatigued. He was afebrile throughout the episode
and was treated with two courses of antibiotics with slowly
improved
symptoms. A new murmur was heard on exam and an echocardiogram
was performed. This revealed severe 4+ mitral valve
regurgitation with anterior leaflet prolapse and a likely torn
chord. Given the severity of his disease, he was referred for
surgical evaluation. Of note, he also underwent a chest CT on
[**5-4**] which showed moderate bilateral pleural effusions and
multi-lobar ground glass
opacifications.  He is admitted after cath today with plans for
OR on Wed [**5-19**]

Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is bilealet mitral leaflet flail
anterior worse than poterior with obvious torn chorde visible.
The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt.

Post Bypass: Patient in sinus rhythm on phenylepherine.
Mechanical mitral valve in place with no perivalvular leaks (#27
St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] per surgeon). No perivalvular leaks. Peak mitral
gradient 17, mean 7 mm Hg with cardiac output 9 L/min. Overall,
preserved biventricular function but note is made of some
atypical septal motion post bypass. LVEF 50-55% Aortic contours
intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeon at the time of the exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
Presented for cardiac catheterization as preoperative evaluation
for mitral valve surgery which revealed normal coronary
arteries.  He was admitted post procedure and preoperative chest
Xray revealed right middle lobe opacity that he underwent CT
scan which revealed ground glass opacities without focal
consolidation.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2162-5-19**] where
the patient underwent Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve
Replacement with a 27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve.   Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Flomax was initiated for urinary retention.  Chest tubes were
discontinued without complication.  Heparin was initiated as a
bridge to coumadin until INR became therapeutic.  The patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 6
the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged home with VNA services in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
