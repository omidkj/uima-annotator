[**7-17**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) with regional variation: the inferior and
posterior walls are akinetic; the apex is dyskinetic, and the
remaining segments are moderately or severely hypokinetic. The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
FINDINGS:
.
Right internal jugular catheter again terminates in the lower
SVC.  There is no main, branch, lobar, or segmental pulmonary
embolus.  The main and right pulmonary arteries are prominent at
3.2 and 2.6 cm, and may indicate pulmonary hypertension in the
correct clinical setting.  Heart is normal in size, with no
evidence of right heart strain and trace physiologic pericardial
fluid.  Incidental note is made of a bovine aortic arch.  There
are dense calcifications throughout the thoracic aorta, coronary
arteries, and posterior descending artery.  Mild calcifications
involve the aortic and mitral valve annuli.
.
Endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina.  There is
evidence of
retained secretions in both mainstem bronchi.  Pleural
parenchymal scarring and paraseptal emphysema are noted at the
lung apices.  Mild pulmonary edema with smooth interlobular
septal thickening, moderate simple bilateral pleural effusions,
and central venous congestion.  There is bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis/collapse.  Superimposed bilateral ground-glass and
solid opacities are present in a peribronchovascular
distribution, with "tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]" sign and partial consolidation
in the right upper lobe.
.
Prominent intrathoracic lymph nodes measure up to 14 mm in the
prevascular, 13 mm in the superior right paratracheal, and [**8-2**]
mm in the right hilar stations. There is mediastinal
lipomatosis.
.
Examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but
reveals
nasogastric tube coursing into the stomach.  There is borderline
fatty
infiltration of the liver.  Several colonic diverticula are
noted at the
splenic flexure, without acute inflammation.
.
Multiple bilateral old healed rib fractures are identified.
.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No pulmonary embolus.
2.  Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral effusions.
3.  Multifocal pneumonia, most severe in the right upper lobe.
.
[**2122-7-26**] Renal US
Right kidney measures 11.1 cm.  Left kidney measures 11.1 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis, stone, or mass seen bilaterally.
The kidneys are normal in contour and echogenicity.  The bladder
is underdistended but unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
#ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL:
After stabilization and intubation in the emergency department
the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Initial CXR showed
evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion/edema and probable
pneumonia. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics to cover
CAP and aspiration pneumonia, vancomycin/Zosyn/azithromycin,
which he receved for 8 days. Pulmonary edema resolved steadily
with IV furosemide.  Pulmonary embolism was considered in the
differential diagnosis and the pt had a CTA on the second day of
admission which revealed no PE, but extensive bibasilar
atelectasis and evidence of pneumonia. His repiratory status
steadily improved on ventilator over the first few days. His
oxygenation was PEEP responsive. He was successfully extubated
on [**2122-7-21**]. BiPap was used during the first 12hrs
post-extubation, but then was no longer required. He has been
successfully clearing secretions and was on supplemental O2 via
nasal cannula when transferred to the floor, which he
successfully weaned to room air in short time.  On day of
discharge, he had no respiratory symptoms and was breathing
comfortably on room air.
