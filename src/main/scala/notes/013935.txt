History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2026**] is a 58 year old gentlemen with a PMH significant for
HTN, ESRD on MWF HD, seizure disorder, Hepatitis B, and CHF
admitted for altered mental status and fever. The patient was
brought in to [**Hospital1 18**] by EMS after complaining of bilateral leg
pain, HA, NBNB emesis x1, and RUE weakness. Upon initial
presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS 102.4 120 16 175/100 100%RA.
The patient was complaining of left-sided arm and leg weakness
as well as a diffuse HA. Exam was notable for left facial droop,
CXR with bibasilar atelectasis, and ECG was notable for peaked T
waves with a potassium of 6.8. The patient was treated with
bicarb, 10 units regular insulin, 1 amp D50, and kayexalate with
improvement in potassium to 4.8. The patient received gentle
IVF, vancomycin, pip/tazo, and ceftriaxone. An LP was attempted
but the patient refused periprocedurally. Of note, the patient
has a history of dialysis line infections, most recently in [**2113**]
by tip culture and [**2115**] by swab. Following insulin
administration, the patient became persistently hypoglycemic
requiring 3 amps D50 and then continuous infusion for D10 at 100
cc/hr.
The patient was then transferred to the MICU for further
management. Currently, the patient denies HA, weakness, CP/SOB,
f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA. The patient further denies any
history of recent HA.
.
Review of systems: As per HPI. Patient states that he has a
history of past CVA. Patient is anuri

Past Medical History:
- Seizure disorder, onset of seizures in mid [**2097**] after
starting dialysis. He seems to have seizures quite frequently at
dialysis, per neurology this seems to be attributed to both
non-compliance with the medications, as well as taking his
medications later on those days.

nephropathy. [**2-1**] right thigh HD graft placed. Removed from
transplant list [**2-1**]. History of MSSA TDC line infections, most
recently in [**2113**] (tip culture) and [**2115**] (swab).
- Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 25-30% per echo in [**10/2114**]
- AV fistula, status post thrombectomy [**7-/2114**]
- Hungry bone syndrome status post parathyroidectomy
- Hepatitis B
- Pituitary mass
- LUE AVG thrombectomy [**2115-12-11**]
- Anemia
- Recent L arm fistula repair (declotting) at [**Hospital1 3278**]

Social History:

career until [**2103**], when he went on disability for unclear
reasons. The patient currently lives alone. He is an organist

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2026**] is a 58 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
ESRD on MWF HD, HTN, seizure disorder, and CHF admitted for
fever, altered mental status, and iatrogenic hypoglycemia.
# Altered mental status/Bacteremia: The patient presented with
altered mental status concerning for infectious delirium,
meningoencephalitis or  post-ictal state.  His Chest x-ray was
without evidence of  infiltrate.  Because of the patient's
headache, inattentitiveness, and fever, the patient was treated
empirically for meningitis, recieving one dose of ceftriaxone,
vancomycin, acyclovir, and ampicillin.  LP was unable to be
obtained and additional attempts were declined by the patient.
The patient's mental status rapidly improved and full meningeal
antibiotic coverage was discontinued.   The patient was
continued on vancomycin for concern of an infected hemodialysis
line (pt has a history of repeated HD line infections).  He was
continued on leviteracetam and oxcarbazepine and he remained
alert and oriented times 3 the remainder of his hospitalization.
 On the AM of [**2117-5-16**], the patient requested to leave the
hospital against medical advice.  At that same time, it was
noted that his blood cultures from admission were positive for
gram positive cocci (eventually beta strep and staph).   The
importance of continued IV antibiotics was explained to the
patient who refused to stay in the hospital.  In conjunction
with the renal fellow, it was arranged that the patient would
continue to receive IV antibiotics at dialysis.

# Hyperkalemia: The patient had missed a scheduled dialysis
session and presented with a potassium of 6.8.  EKG was
concerning for peaked Twaves.  The patient was treated with
calcium carbonate, insulin and glucose and repeat ECG with
resolution of ECG changes.  His potassium was corrected and he
then underwent hemodialysis with stable post HD potassium.

# Seizure disorder: The patient had a seizure during dialysis,
which is apparently not uncommon for him.  On further discussion
with the patient and neurology, it appears the patient does not
take any of his anti-epileptic drugs as an outpatient.  While
hospitalized, he was kept on leviteracetam and oxcarbazepine.

# CHF: The patient had no current signs or symptoms of volume
overload. He was continued on ASA 81 mg daily and digoxin.

# HTN: Not currently treated with anti-hypertensives.

# Discharge: The patient left AMA on hospital day 2.
