Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23203**] is a 66 yo man with pmhx HTN, DM2, hyperlipidemia, R
MCA CVA who presented with altered mental status, fever, c diff,
seizure and was found to have pna and uti.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.4 HR 103 BP 120/60 R 26 O2 sat
90 % on RA. He was given 1 g vanco, 1 g ceftriaxone, 500 mg IV
flagyl, 975 mg rectal tylenol, 3 liters IVF for presumed UTI and
pna. He had a seizure in ED characterized by tonic clonic
movements witnessed and he was given 2 mg ativan. CT head done
in ED showed evolution of R MCA infarction. While in the ED, he
went into afib with rvr to the 140s which was new for the
patient. He was bolused with fluids but not given beta blockers
because of borderline low blood pressure. Patient was also noted
to be hypoxic to 80s on room air and cxr showed b/l infiltrates.
He was put on NRB and sats went up to mid 90s. Patient's family
confirmed DNR/DNI and did not want central line placed either.
.
On admission to the ICU, patient was tachy to 120-140s, SBP low
100s, afebrile, RR 20-30s and satting 88-90% on 100% NRB.
.
#. MS [**Name13 (STitle) 52034**] had multiple reasons for ms changes. Most
likely reason is infection given fever, newly diagnosed pna and
uti and recently diagnosed c diff infection. Patient had normal
ms after his cva and was alert and oriented x 3 before the past
few days when he began to spike fevers. He is somnolent now
after seizure in ED follwed by ativan and morphine. His stoke
may also be contributing although head CT showed evolution of
cva not a new stroke or bleeding into the stroke already
present.  He was initially treated with vanc, zosyn and flagyl
He was given a dilantin load and then continued on q 8 hour
dilantin at 100 mg.  EEG was done although seizure occured in
setting of fever of 104 which is likely culprit although he does
have known stroke focus.  He was not communicative, but did move
right side, respond to painful stimuli and eye flutter to voice.
 Neurology consulted but not following. MS changes likely
multifactorial, infection (PNA, UTI, Cdiff), stroke, hypoxia, w/
some residual deficits from old stroke. His mental status did
not recover after 2 days and after conversation with his wife,
his status was changed to [**Name (NI) 3225**].

#. Hypoxia- Patient had a large Aa gradient. This is likely due
to pna. He is unlikely to have PE given supratherapeutic INR of
6.1 and his cxr shows b/l infiltrates c/w pna. This could be
aspiration pna given ms changes and recent stroke. Pt may also
have a component of fluid overload from IVF given in ED.
He was treated with vanc and zosyn for broad coverage of nursing
home/hosp acquired pna and aspiration. Non-invasive ventilation
was started but he became uncomfortable, NC was used, then
discontinued after he became [**Name (NI) 3225**].
.
#. Hypotension- Fever, bandemia, consolidations on cxr, dirty
ua, recent c dif dx point towards sepsis as likely cause.
Patient also in afib with rvr which is contributing. Attempted
to slow hr down with 5 mg IV lopressor and pressure dropped to
70s systolic. He was given IVF to keep MAP > 65.  No central
access or a-line was placed as per his wife.
.
# cdif- He was continued on IV flagyl as he could not take po
due to mental status changes.
.
#. UTI- UA positive for leuks, bacteria and nitrites.  He was
treated with vanc and zosyn as he was covered for PNA was well.
Antibiotics were discontinued when the patients status was
changed to [**Name (NI) 3225**]
.
#. PNA- Patient could have nursing home associated pna and he
has recently been hospitalized. He had bands on diff,
consolidation on cxr and fever. Treated initially with
vanc/zosyn, then discontinued.

.
#. ARF- likely pre-renal given low bp and afib with rvr, sepsis.
Bolused w/ IVF and renally dosed meds. Held lisinopril.
.
#. Stroke- Patient has known MCA infarct and on CT head here he
has evolution of infarct but no new stroke or bleed.
Dilantin loaded and maitenance doses given, INR was
supratherapeutic, held coumadin
continued asa pr.
.
#. Seizure- patient had seizure in ED likely related to high
grade fever or known cva. Given ativan in ED. Dilantin as above
and eeg with results as reported.
.
#. hyperlipidemia- held statin as npo
.
#. HTN-held anti-hypertensives as pt was hypotensive
.
#. Afib- patient already supratherapeutic on coumadin, rate
under better control after 5 mg IV lopressor
.
#. DM- RISS, finger sticks qachs
.
#. FEN- IVF bolus to keep MAP > 65, replete lytes prn, npo
.
#. PPx- IV protonix, no need for subq heparin as last INR was 6
.
#. Access: 2 PIV, family does not want central access
.
#. Communication: with wife: [**Name (NI) 2048**] [**Name (NI) 23203**], p# is (c)
