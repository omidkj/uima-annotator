History of Present Illness:
66F with CAD s/p MI [**2108**], now with 3VD awaiting 5v CABG
(scheduled [**9-26**]) that presents from an OSH with +CEs in setting
of fever to 102.9, HR 113, RLL infiltrate on CXR.
.
The pt underwent an abnormal ETT-MIBI ([**2125-8-15**]). During that
test the patient exercised for 4 minutes 59 seconds to a HR 123.
 No CP, however, the patient did report DOE and ECG revealed 1mm
of horizontal ST segment depression in leads II, III, AVF and
V4-V6. Imaging revealed apical hypokinesis, evidence of a
reversible anteroseptal and an anteroapical perfusion
abnormality and an EF of 65%. The pt subsequently underwent
cardiac catheterization (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] on [**9-3**] that revealed
diffuse 3VD (see details below.)
.
Last night the pt notes she was in her usual state of health.
She was awoken from sleep with sub-sternal chest pressure with
radiation to the arm, -N/V, + diaphoresis. The pt took 3
Sub-Lingual Nitroglycerin which resolved her symptoms. The pt's
friend subsequently called EMS and she was taken to [**Hospital 6451**] Hospital. Upon arrival to the hospital the patient was
noted to have temperature to 102.8, 111/70 HR 89 (113 at time of
EMS). RR 18-20. Exam notable for bibasilar crackles. Cardiac
exam benign. WBC 13K. Pt with infiltrate on CXR, troponin > 20.
The pt was given ASA, loaded with plavix, given Lopressor 12.5mg
and started on Heparin gtt. The pt was given 1 dose of
Solumedrol 100mg. The pt was given doses of Levaquin and
Vancomycin for RLL infiltrate. The pt was subsequently
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managament of NSTEMI.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. Denies chills or rigors. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. The pt notes she had felt slightly confused over
the last few days.
.
Upon arrival to the patient had no complaints.

Pertinent Results:
[**2125-9-22**]:  Offical CT read:
1.  Lytic lesion is consistent with a hemangioma
2.  Bones do have a mottled appearance
3.  Subacute DVT in R external iliac vein
4.  Mild T12 compression fracture
5.  Cyst in left ovary- 15mm (follow with pelvic ultrasound)
6.  Retroperitoneal lymphnodes are not pathologic because they
are <1cm.  Recommend CT follow-up in 3 months to monitor for
progression.  Could be due to DVT.
.
MRI head [**2125-9-17**]:
IMPRESSION: No direct evidence to support lupus cerebritis.
Diffuse symmetric white matter lesions do not appear acute in
nature and most likely representing chronic microvascular
ischemic disease; however, correlation with prior imaging if
available is recommended.
.
Non-contrast head CT [**9-16**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of normal pressure hydrocephalus. Mild
ventricular
prominence may be explained by age-appropriate involutional
changes given
proportionate sulcal prominence.
2. Moderately severe chronic microvascular infarction.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**9-15**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-12**], there is little
change. The heart remains within normal limits and there is no
vascular congestion or pleural effusion. Specifically, no
evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
.
EKG: NSR, HR 86, Mild Left Axis shift, Normal PR, Narrow QRS,
TWI in V1-V4, PRWP.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three
vessel disease. The LMCA had non-obstructive CAD. The LAD was
moderately
calcified with an 80% ostial and a subtotally occluded stenosis
mid
vessel. There was a filling defect consistant with thrombus at
the
distal margin of the mid LAD lesion. The LCx had non-obstructive
CAD.
The OM1 had an 80% stenosis in the proximal vessel. The RCA was
moderately calcified and had a mid 95% stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal central arterial
blood
pressure with a systolic of 124, diastolic of 63, and mean of
69mmHg.
3. Unsuccessful PTCA of the mid LAD with a 2.0 x 20mm Sprinter
balloon
complicated by subintimal dissection. Final angiography revealed
99%
residual stenosis, a grade IV proximal to distal LAD dissection,
and
TIMI 2 flow. (see PTCA comments for details)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Unsuccessful PTCA of the LAD.
4. Emergent CABG.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o female with CAD s/p MI in [**2108**], now with 3VD on cardiac
catheterization ([**2125-9-3**]), awaiting 5v CABG on [**2125-9-26**], who is
tranferred from OSH with NSTEMI and SIRS/Sepsis from presumed
PNA, with a hospital course complicated by fevers of unclear
etiology.
.
# Fevers of unclear etiology - patient developed fevers as high
as 105.2 of unclear etiology.  She had negative blood cultures,
negative urine cultures, negative C. diff, was treated for
presumed pneumonia on cxr (despite significant symptoms) with a
7 day course of vencomycin and levofloxacin, underwent LP (which
was negative at the time of this report).  Patient also had
remote history of SLE, has been on chronic steroids for 30+
years, and rheumatology was consulted for possible rheumatoligic
etiology.  [**Doctor First Name **] returned po
