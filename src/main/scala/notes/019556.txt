Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 46 yo female with severe depression who p/w suicidal
overdose of CCb, BB, thiazide, trileptal and Clonopin.
.
# CCB and BB and lisinopril and HCTZ overdose: associated with
hyperglycemia, bradycardia and hypotension.  The patient was
intubated for airway protection.  Toxicology was consulted and
helped manage care.  For beta blocker overdose she was given
calcium gluconate, and was started on emergent glucagon, insulin
and D50 dirps with a goal insulin dose of 1U/kg.  For her
Lisinopril/ HCTZ overdose she received supportive care. A
central line was placed and the patient's hypotension was
treated with Levophed, Neosynephrine and Dopamine.  She was
emergently dialyzed with CVVHD for x 2 days for removal of
atenolol from her system.  Pressors were gradually weaned as
tolerated and insulin and glucagon drips were subsuquently
weaned.  Her mental status improved and she awoke without any
apparent neurologic deficits.  She was extubated greater than 48
hours prior to transfer to psychiatry
.
# Trileptal/ Clonopin overdose: was felt to likely not be
contributing to current pathology other than with sedative
effects.  As above she was intubated for aiway support and
sedated mainly with propofol (avoiding benzodiazepines).  She
did recieve flumazenil x 1.
.
# With regard to her hypotension/shock, she was also
pan-cultured with negative results.  She had a questionable
infiltrate on CXR and is being treated with a 7-day course of
levofloxacin..
.
# ARF: Ms [**Known lastname 45956**] renal failure was likely from shock which
resolved.  She was emergently dialyzed as above for overdose.
.
# Bipolar/depression: s/p suicide.  Psychiatry service was
notified.  A sitter was with the patient at all times.  She is
being discharged to a psychiatric in-patient service at [**Hospital1 18**]
for further treatment.
