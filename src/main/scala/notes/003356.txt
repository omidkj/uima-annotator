Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 81 year old female with Abd pain, biliary dilation, 8
mm stone in CBD, fever, elevated WBC and hypotension.  She was
transferred here for further treatment for cholangitis/
choledocholithiasis.  She was on ASA and Plavix.

In the ED she was hypotensive and tachycardic. She went to the
ICU for aggressive IVF resuscitation for hypovolemia. She
received Lopressor for her tachycardia.

Tachycardia: She continued to have intermittent
A-fib/tachycardia once on the floor. She was triggered for A-fib
on [**2127-12-24**]. All of her home meds were restarted and she received
additional Lopressor as needed. Her cardiologist in NH was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and she will follow-up with him next week. Our
cardiologist were consulted and they recommended a ECHO which
will be done in NH.

COPD: She continued on her inhalers and pursed lip breathing.
Her O2 by nasal cannula continued as she is home dependent.

CHF: CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary
edema. Findings are typical for congestive heart failure.
She received Lasix with good effect and diuresis for fluid
overload.

Rectal exam: On rectal exam, a rectal/cervical mass was noted.
After further investigation, she was found to have a pessary,
and not a rectal mass. It was recommended that she follow-up
with her PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] colonoscopy.

Choledocholithiasis: She went for ERCP on [**2127-12-20**] and a
cholangiogram shows dilated CBD with at least two filling
defects consistent with stones. A plastic biliary stent was
placed across the stones. Numerous filling defects are seen
within the gallbladder consistent with stones. Cystic duct is
normal.
Her LFT's, Tbili recovered and trended down to normal levels.
Her diet was slowly advanced as she was able to tolerate a
regular diet by time of discharge.
Her abdominal pain resolved and abdomen was soft and
nondistended.
She will need ERCP and stent removal in the future.

ABX: Levofloxacin  started [**12-20**] (received 1 dose Zosyn at
[**Location (un) 8641**]), received 4d of Flagyl. She will complete 10 day course
of antibiotics.

Imaging:
