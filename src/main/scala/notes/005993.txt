Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No thrombus in
the RAA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Low normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Normal RV systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque. Normal aortic diameter at
the sinus level. Simple atheroma in aortic root. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: The pericardium may be thickened.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications. The
patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with inferior hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
4. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal
free wall contractility.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.
8. The pericardium may be thickened.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. A-pacing . Preserved
biventricular systolic function. LVEF = 55%. Trace MR. Aortic
contour is normal post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2169-1-24**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] went to the operating room and underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting x
4(LIMA->LAD/RIMA->RCA/SVG->OM1/OM2). Please refer to
Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report for further details. He was
transferred sedated and intubated to the CVICU. He awoke
neurologically intact, weaned off drips and was extubated in a
timely fashion. All lines and tubes were discontinued when
appropriate criteria was met. POD#1 beta-blocker, statin,
aspirin was initiated and he was transferred to the step down
unit for further telemetry monitoring. The remainder of his
postoperative course was essentially uncomplicated. He continued
to progress and was ready for discharge on POD# 4. All follow up
appointments were advised.
