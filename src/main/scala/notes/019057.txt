Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the OR on [**2145-3-25**] for DCD renal transplant by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]. The donor was a 22-year-old, brain-dead male
donor who was Hep C and Hep B core antibody positive with a
prior history of drug use. IV Vanco was given for recent blood
culture. Induction immunosuppression consisted of solumedrol,
cellcept and simulect. Urine output was 9-17cc/hour. He was then
taken back to the OR for emergent ex-lap for postop hemorrhage
from the drain site.  Please see operative dictations for the
above procedures.

Postop he was tachycardic with Hct drop to 31.4 and K+ 8.4. He
was emergently dialyzed without ultrafiltration after
insulin/dextrose and calcium were given. He was transferred to
the SICU. Post K+ was 5.2. Serial Hcts dropped to 22 with inr
1.8. He was given 5 u PRBC,3 FFP, vit K and DDAVP for plt
dysfunction. An ultrasound done of the transplanted kidney was
normal with no perinephric collection. On pod 1 he was dialyzed
again for K 5.6. Labetolol was given for sbp ranging b/w
160-180. He remained on Levo for previous bacteremia. Lamivudine
was continue for HAART and HBV prophylaxis. ID followed closely.

On pod 2 ([**3-27**])he spiked at temp 102. Blood cultures were done
and negative. CXR showed plate-like atelectasis in the right
lower lung. The previously visualized question of a nodular
opacity in the right mid lung was not visualized. There were no
new infiltrates. Lasix iv was given x1 with minimal response.

On pod 1&2 he experienced loss of consciousness. He was
transferred back to the SICU for an unresponsive episode.
Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI/EEG. MRI showed no
acute ischemia. Chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No
findings indicative of posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy.
1.8 cm cyst within the posterior nasopharynx indicating a
Tornwaldt's cyst. Slight heterogeneity of the signal intensity
of the clivus which may represent sequela of chronic anemia or
possibly a marrow infiltrative disorder.  EEG was negative for
seizure activity. No anti-seizure medication was recommended
given that it was unclear whether he had had a seizure.

LFTs increased. Hepatology followed and recommended u/s with
doppler to assess PV. U/S was unremarkable. LFTs trended back
down. Hemodialysis was done intermittently for delayed graft
function. Diet was advanced.

He received several doses of prograf then became
supratherapeutic with a level of 47. Prograf was held. He
continued to receive dilaudid for c/o back pain and RLQ pain
near drain site. [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was removed on pod 7. He continued
to be anuric requiring intermittent hemodialysis.

On POD 9 he continued to complain of pain. A KUB was done for
abdominal distension and tympanitic exam which showed possible
bowel obstruction. An abdominal CT revealed a large heterogenous
perinephric collection measuring 16 cm in maximum diameter and
which most likely represents hemorrhage. He was taken to the OR
by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] for exploration and evacuation of a
large hematoma evacuation and a biopsy of the renal transplant.
On [**4-4**] Prograf 1mg was given for a level of 9.7.

On POD 10 the renal biopsy returned positive for rejection.
Solumedrol 500mg IV QD was ordered for 3 days then 250mg once
then 20mg qd. Prior to d/c prograf level was 5.6. He was given a
one time dose of 2mg. Outpatient labs will be drawn every Monday
and Thursday. The transplant clinic will call him with next dose
of prograf based on levels.
Abd pain decreased following evacuation. He tolerated a renal
diet and he was ambulating with a cane and rolling walker.
Hemodialysis continued intermittently based on labs and physical
exam. Labs will be drawn on Tuesday. Nephrology will order HD.
Lasix 100mg  qd was ordered. He was dialyzed on [**4-8**] prior to
discharge home.
