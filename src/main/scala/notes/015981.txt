fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:


History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old female with history of SLE, left
sialolithiasis s/p ENT removal of stone who presents today with
high spiking fevers of 1 day's duration up to 104. She states
that she went to her ENT Dr.[**Name (NI) 18353**] office yesterday for
increased swelling and pain of her left submandibular region.
During that office visit Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] massaged a 2mm sialolith out
of her [**Location (un) 21511**] duct and expressed a small amount of pinkish
tinged pus. She has a history of submandibular MRSA cellulitis,
and as such was started on Bactrin DS.
.
However, once she returned home, she developed frank rigors and
fever up to 104. She also had N/V x4, after which she developed
right sided chest and back pain which she attributes to the
retching. She has had this pain in the past. She also states
however that she has had a headache over this same period with
some neck pain associated. The pain is worse with neck flexion
and she had some relief with tylenol. With neck flexion she also
has some lumbar pain. She also describes pain behind her eyes,
although she denies photophobia or sound sensitivity. She states
that while she has had fevers in the past with SLE flares along
with generalized body pain and weakness, she has never had a
headache in the past. Of note, she has been on immunosuppresive
drugs in the recent past, with MMF being stopped only on [**6-23**].
She was also on prednisone as recently as [**5-27**].
.
On day of admission, she continued to complain of left
mandibular swelling and tenderness, although her main complaints
are primarily the fever as well as the headache. Of note, she
states that she had been feeling well since her submandibular
gland resection in early [**Month (only) 205**], but as recently as last week had
diaphoresis and the feeling of generalized malaise.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 102.8 P 87 BP 139/73 R 20 O2 sat.
99% on RA. Patient was given tylenol, vancomycin, unasyn and 3L
of NS
.
On the floor, patient had neck stiffness and lower bck pain.
Givent concern for [**Last Name (LF) 21514**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] LP was planned.  INR was 2.6
from coumadin and she was giving FFP, with a goal INR < 1.5.
She got 5 units, while procedure service was on call.  On the
fifth unit, she had a desaturation to 82 % on RA.  She got a neb
treatment for diffuse wheezing.  She was briefly on a
non-rebreather, but quickly improved and was [**Doctor Last Name 21515**] 98% on room
air on evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:

with fevers spiking to 104 and vomiting x2 after expression of
saliolith and pus from left [**Location (un) 21511**] duct.

# Meningismus: The patient upon transfer to the floor endorsed
neck stiffness, headache and lumbar pain on neck flexion.  ENT
was consulted and direct spread from a submandibular abscess was
deemed unlikely.  She was started empirically on ceftriaxone,
flagyl and vancomycin, and the decision to LP was made.
However, the patient was anticoagulated and FFP was given to
transiently decrease the INR to make the procedure safe.  The
patient's INR did not drop sufficiently, and after 5 units of
FFP became transiently hypoxic.  She was transferred to the
MICU, where she was stabilized and given vitamin K.  ID was
consulted, and after further discussion it was decided that LP
would still yield helpful information even if the cultures
