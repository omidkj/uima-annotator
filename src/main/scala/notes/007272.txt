This dictation will cover the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course from
[**2191-12-24**], to [**2191-12-30**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60 year old female
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
requiring intubation, who was admitted [**2191-12-24**], intubated
secondary to hypercarbic respiratory arrest due to a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  Prior to this
admission, the patient reports increasing shortness of breath
over the last month, one week of increasing lower extremity
edema and orthopnea.  She remained intubated for four days in
the Intensive Care Unit and treated with steroids, Albuterol,
Atrovent, Levaquin and Flagyl.  She was felt to have a
component of congestive heart failure and was subsequently
diuresed.  She was maintained on a CIWA scale for ethanol
abuse/withdrawal.  Her Medical Intensive Care Unit admission
was complicated by upper airway obstruction and edema felt to
be secondary to traumatic extubation as the patient self
extubated in the Emergency Department on presentation and
reintubated.  She also had a metabolic alkalosis which was
treated with Diamox.  Her agitation in the Medical Intensive
Care Unit was thought to be secondary to ethanol withdrawal.
The patient was extubated on [**2191-12-28**], without event.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, pulse 101, blood
pressure 120/62, respiratory rate 28, oxygen saturation 88 to
89% on five liters.  Pertinent findings revealed she was
sitting up in bed comfortable in mild respiratory distress.
Her heart was regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs had
decreased breath sounds throughout with scattered expiratory
rhonchi.  Abdominal examination was soft, nontender,
nondistended.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of transfer, laboratories were
remarkable for a bicarbonate of 35.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the floor
and progressed well.  On [**2191-12-30**], she did describe some mild
cough but was breathing better.  No dyspnea.  Her CIWA scale
had not been continued on transfer as she had not required
Ativan the day before transfer.

In terms of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation, she was continued on Prednisone and the patient
was started on a slow taper of 30 mg times an additional
three days, 20 mg times four days and 10 mg times four days.
She was also continued on the Combivent inhaler.  She was
also continued on Levofloxacin for a ten day course.

In terms of her diastolic heart dysfunction, she was
continued on Diltiazem 120 mg p.o. once daily.

In terms of her tobacco and ethanol abuse, she did have a
social work consultation while in transient to the floor.

As the patient is known to be a CO2 retainer, the patient
should not have her oxygen turned up for fear of respiratory
arrest.
