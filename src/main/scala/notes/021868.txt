Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
70 yo M with [**Hospital 7235**] medical problems including ESRD on HD
M/W/F iwth HD line that was changed [**6-11**], diabetes (? not on
insulin per discharge meds from earlier this month), sCHF FE
40%, HTN, HLP, boderline PD who was found to be unresponsive at
HD yesterday with BP 70/40 and fingerstick to fs 41.  Recent
admission for pseudomonal urosepsis in [**Month (only) 547**] and c. diff in [**Month (only) 116**].
Also has ? discitis/osteomyelitis but negative bone biopsy in
[**Month (only) **].

At HD, he received an amp of D50 and MS improved to - A/O x3 and
he was brought to [**Location (un) 620**] ED. There, EKG showed with AV pacing
and trop found to be elevated to 0.4 (baseline per ED there is
0.3). Got PR ASA and was sent here for ROMI/NSTEMI.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED last night, pressures remained low,
hypoxic on 3L (unclear baseline O2 requirement).  BP's were
90/palp and pt was bradycardic to 38 (though unclear how it's
possible given that pt is paced).  Given slightly higher trop,
there was initial concern for NSTEMI.  He receive 2L IVF for his
hypotension and cardiology was consulted.  They were not
concerned given trop around baseline.  Unclear if EKG's were
faxed for them to look at.  Overnight, pressures improved with
IVF, no antibiotics or blood cultures were drawn.  Fingersticks
continued to be low 40-80 and he was started on D5 gtt at 100
cc/hr.  BP's overnight continued to be low and this morning D5
increased to 150cc/hr.

CT torsos (one without contrast and one with contrast) were
obtained to look for source of hypoglycemia and found a
large-moderate intussception and L3/L4 discitis.  Surgery was
consulted for intussception and felt comfortable with medical
admission, no emergent surgery given lactate 0.6 this morning at
3am.  Radiology read partial obstruction with small amount of
contrast passing through but very edematous bowel and
recommended that surgery address. Additionally, renal masses
concerning for RCC were noted which are old.  Per prior
transplant note, nephrology/urology aware, last urology visit
[**2-/2167**] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3748**].

This morning, blood cultures were drawn and CTX/vanco were
ordered (unclear if given) in the [**Name (NI) **].

Vitals prior to transfer to the ICU: 4L nc, sating 99%.  BP
114/64. HR 60 paced. Per ED resident. abd exam totally benign.

CXR ([**2167-7-7**]) - IMPRESSION: No pneumonia. Mild pulmonary
congestion.

CT A/P ([**2167-7-7**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Prior gastric bypass surgery with enteroenteric
intussusception in the
left upper quadrant at the distal anastomosis. No evidence of
proximal
dilation of bowel to suggest obstruction at the time of the
examination but correlation with physical examination is
recommended.
2. Destructive change of L3-4 endplates with appearance of
widening of
intervertebral space, unchanged from CT of lumbar spine of
[**2167-6-29**], may
again represent noninfective spondyloarthropathy although
superimposed
infection (discitis/osteomyelitis) cannot be entirely excluded
and clinical correlation is necessary.
3. Cholelithiasis in a moderately distended gallbladder. Cannot
assess
gallbladder wall without IV contrast. If concern for acute
cholecystitis,
recommend ultrasound or HIDA. Unchanged probable stone or sludge
in the CBD.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to large on the left
and small on
the right. Ascites and anasarca.
5. Marked coronary artery calcifications. Marked vascular
calcifications
throughout the abdomen.

CT A/P ([**2167-7-7**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent jejunojejunal intussusception at the distal
anastomosis with
marked bowel wall edema in the intussuscepted bowel and partial
small bowel obstruction.
2. Oral contrast in the excluded stomach and afferent limb,
consistent with either represent reflux secondary to obstruction
from the intussusception or a fistula between the gastric
remnant and the excluded stomach or components of both
processes.
3. Bilateral enhancing renal masses. The largest one in the left
upper pole demonstrates interval increase in size. Findings are
again concerning for renal cell carcinoma.
4. Unchanged cystic pancreatic lesions. Could be further
assessed by MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 40806**]y indicated.
5. Similar destructive appearance of L3-L4 compared to the prior
L-spine CT study eight days ago. Findings again may represent
renal spondyloarthropathy but clinical correlation is necessary
to exclude osteomyelitis/discitis.
6. Similar cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis, without
evidence of acute cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo M with [**Hospital 7235**] medical problems including ESRD on HD
M/W/F, diabetes, sCHF EF 40%, HTN, HLP, borderline PD who was
found to be unresponsive at HD with BP 70/40 and fingerstick to
fs 41 thought to be secondary to UTI.

# Hypoglycemia: Etiology unclear. In the MICU, patient initially
required D10 gtt which was then weaned off. However, several
hours after the D10 gtt was stopped, the patient's blood sugars
dropped back down to the 60's, ultimately requiring the D10 gtt
to be restar
