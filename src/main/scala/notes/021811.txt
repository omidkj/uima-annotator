Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
female with multiple medical problems who was transferred
from [**Hospital3 **] for management of congestive heart
failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and mental status
changes.  The patient originally presented on [**12-11**]
with complaints of increasing shortness of breath,
nonproductive cough, and altered mental status.  The husband
stated that the patient was well until two days prior to
admission to [**Hospital3 **] when she began feeling weak.
Per report, she was unable to arise from the chair.  She had
increased pain at her decubitus ulcer site and some watery
diarrhea from her colostomy site.  This was associated with
some shortness of breath, but the husband denied any focal
pain in the chest or abdomen of the wife.

The patient had a baseline creatinine of 1.4 in early
[**Month (only) 1096**], and her creatinine was 1.9 on admission to [**Hospital3 21232**] which bumped to a high of 2.9 on [**12-15**]
(discontinued Lasix on [**12-15**]) after aggressive diuresis
and then fell back to 2.5 on transfer.

Renal consult was obtained on [**12-14**] who suggested a
prerenal azotemia secondary to dehydration versus congestive
heart failure.  They recommended stopping diuresis with
Lasix, stopping the patient's ACE inhibitor, and providing
gentle hydration.

The patient was noted to have a urinary tract infection at
the time of discharge and was started empirically on Rocephin
at [**Hospital3 **].  It did not appear that she demonstrated
an increase white blood cell count nor did she become
febrile.  Her original chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 **] demonstrated a
left lower lobe consolidation (atelectasis versus pneumonia),
and she was continued on Rocephin therapy.

Neurology was consulted for mental status changes who
suggested checking a head CT which was without evidence of
bleed or mass.  Other suggestions including an EEG and MRI
were not performed at the time.

In addition, the patient was noted to have a low hematocrit
at [**Hospital3 **] with normal iron studies, normal B12, and
folate.  Her hematocrit stayed stable at 26-27.  She had an
elevated INR of 6.0 on [**12-14**], and therefore, her Coumadin
was held.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] as it became difficult to
manage her congestive heart failure in the setting of acute
on chronic renal failure and secondary to mental status
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 76-year-old female with
multiple medical problems who was transferred from an outside
hospital for further management of acute on chronic renal
failure, congestive heart failure, and mental status changes.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was known to have a history
of coronary artery disease and known congestive heart
failure; however, the patient had never undergone a
catheterization.  Echocardiogram obtained at the outside
hospital in [**Month (only) 1096**] showed a decrease ejection fraction
compared to her echocardiogram at our facility in [**2113-6-11**].

On original presentation to the outside hospital, the patient
was thought to be in congestive heart failure and underwent
significant diuresis with perhaps some component of
overdiuresis.  At the time of discharge to [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was felt to be
rather dry, and therefore her Lasix dose was held, and she
was given a gentle fluid challenge of 500 cc.  The patient
responded to this with an increase in her urine output and
improvement in her creatinine.
