Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year-old female with a history of metastatic
non-small cell lung cancer on hospice brought in by her family
for altered mental status. Patient unable to give me any
information regarding her symptoms. She was able to shake her
head that she was not in any pain. Family is divided in the type
of care they think their mother should receive. I spoke with the
HCP, [**Name (NI) 717**], who is the patient's daughter. She confirmed that
her mother would not want to be intubated or rescusitated. She
reports that over the last week she has been more lethargic. She
is mostly sedentary and has not walked in the last week but was
previously walking. She was noted to have a fever friday and the
son was concerned that she was developing a pna. Per pcp notes,
plan was to have her come into the office if possible for an
xray. No sob, cough or increased oxygen requirement. Pt is on 2
liters nc at home. She was noted to have no appetite and was
barely eating. Her family gave her solids yesterday and she had
an incident of coughing/choking with that per HCP. HCP left her
mother the night of admission and reports she was sleeping
comfortably. Her other daughter and son came over and thought
the patient looked worse and brought her into the ED. She was
also just started on thorazine for "terminal agitation". It was
making her very lethargic so the dose was decreased from 50 mg
tid to 25 mg tid. Last dose just prior to coming to the ED. Pt
on fentanyl 200 mcg q 72 and oxyfast at her usual doses.

CXR: Interval increase in right pleural effusion. Right lower
lobe
opacity is likely due to pneumonic consolidation. Asymmetric
interstitial
prominence probably due to edema.

CTH:  No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. No change

significantly more sensitive for metastatic disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 11480**] is an 87 year-old female with a history of
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer on hospice who presents
with altered mental status, fever, and leukocytosis likely
secondary to aspiration pneumonia.  Patient was DNR/DNI on
admission, and intially received IV antibiotics and NIPPV while
goals of care were discussed with family. After discussion with
her family, the patient was transitioned to NRB. Patient became
progressively hypotensive and hypoxic and expired shortly
thereafter.

1.Altered mental status: Patient has underlying vascular
dementia. Given her fever and tacchycardia with CXR
demonstrating a focal infiltrate, likely secondary to pneumonia.
 Other possibilities include medications including her narcotics
but patient did not respond to narcan or thorazine which was
just started this week. Pt is also volume depleted which can
contribute. Head CT negative for midline shift, hemorrhage or
metastatic disease. Neuro exam not suggestive of acute stroke.
No e/o seizure. Hypercarbia is only mild. Patient was started on
clindamycin and levofloxacin for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Patient was also initially provided with NIPPV, which was
transitioned to a NRB upon discussion with her family.

2. Sepsis: Patient meets SIRS criteria with fever, tacchycardia,
and hypotension.  Likely source was penumonia. CXR concerning
for worsening pleural effusion/infiltrate on right side.
Patient given levoflxoacin and clindamycin presumed aspiration
pna given her mental status. She was also aggresively volume
repleted.

3. Hypoxia: Patient uses supplemental oxygen at home due to her
underlying lung disease (lung cancer and copd). Likely worse in
setting of pneumonia.  Received systemic steroids and nebulizers
doing hospitalization.

4. Acute renal failure: In setting of infection and poor oral
intake, likely pre-renal. This is further supported by elevated
BUN and hematocrit well above her baseline. Patient received
aggresive fluid rescucitation during admission.

5. History of marginal zone lymphoma treated with
fludarabine/Rituxan [**2168**]-[**2169**]. No active issues at this time.

6. History of hemolytic anemia status post splenectomy in [**2171**].
Per notes, vaccine status unclear.

7. COPD: Treated with atrovent and albuterol nebs as well as
systemic steroids.

8. GERD: Continued on PPI during admission.

9. PPx: Patient received heparin SQ and PPI during admission.

10. Code status: Patient on presentation was DNR/DNI.  Family
expressed clear wishes that patient was not to be intubated and
that central access, other invasive procedure, or pressors were
not to be initiated.
