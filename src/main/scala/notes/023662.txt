TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2187-5-2**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial
septum is seen at rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] EF >
60%. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen (caused by tenting of the mitral
leaflet due to inferior/inferolateral akinesis) . The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o female w/ [**Age over 90 1902**], afib, severe MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1902**] and [**Hospital **]
transferred to Cardiology service for further management of
heart failure after a short course in the ICU.  She remained in
the ICU for < 2 days.  On the medical floor, heart failure
service was consulted as it was felt that her shortness of
breath may be predominantly due to heart failure (possibly from
MR).  She was transferred to the cardiology service.  The
remainder of the hospital course, by problem, is listed below:

1) [**Hospital 1902**]:  Mild systolic dysfunction with severe MR.  On admission
she had pulmonary edema/volume overload.  Unfortunately, during
her period of acute renal failure she was unable to be diuresed.
 However, on [**5-3**] once creatinine began trending down she was
started on a lasix drip and had  several liters of fluid
removed.  Unfortunately when she developed C. Diff infection
with copious diarrhea she became volume depleted, at which time
her lasix drip was stopped.  As her diarrhea improved she became
volume overloaded again and went back on the lasix drip briefly
for 24 hours.  The day prior to discharge the drip was stopped
and she was started on bumetanide 1 mg daily.  She maintained
even to slightly negative fluid balance on this dose, with
stable weight.  Her weight on discharge is 39.7 kg on the
standing scale and we believe this to be her dry weight.  If her
weight increases by more than 3 pounds she should have her
bumetanide frequency increased to 1 mg twice per day.  If she
has more acute shortness of breath can consider 10 mg IV lasix.
Her blood pressure chronically runs around 90-110 systolic.

2) Mitral regurgitation:  The primary cause of her heart
failure.  Patient was being considered for possible percutaneous
mitral valve repair as an outpatient.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her primary
cardiologist, is looking into this, though she would need
special permission as she does not meet criteria.  For the time
being, she is being managed with afterload and pre-load
reduction with hydralazine 10 mg TID and isosorbide dinitrate 10
mg TID, which she has tolerated well.
