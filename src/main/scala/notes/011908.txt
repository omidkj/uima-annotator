Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9824**]
Chief Complaint:
Rigors

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Tunneling line removal
2. RIJ Tunneling

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 66F with complex medical history significant for DM2,
HTN, ESRD and h/o of multiple HD line infections, transferred to
medicine from the ICU where she had been recovering from proteus
bacteremia and sepsis. Per report, pt was in her normal state of
healthy until [**2128-7-15**], when she went in for dialysis through
Right IJ tunneling line and developed rigors one hour into the
procedure. She was given 250mg Vancomycin x 1, blood cultures
were apparently collected and she was referred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for further management.
.
In the ED initial VS were noted to be HR 123, BP 156/88, RR 28,
Sat 83% on RA. She was triggered for her hypoxia, her hypoxia
improved to 98% on 4L. She further developed hypotension to the
70s, and was started on Levophed. Initial labwork was notable
for WBC 9.6 (86%N), Hgb/Hct 12.6/42. Chem panel showed BUN/Cr
30/5.7, and CXR showed mild vascular congestion. Subsequently
5/6 bottles grew pansensitive GNR, speciated to be proteus. He
was started on vanc/aztreonam/tobramycin initially, changed to
cipro on [**7-18**] following speciation and sensitivity. HD line has
been pulled and culture final report shows no growth. Infectious
workup have been negative thus far: 1) CT initially showed
increase in bile duct size from 7 to 10mm on CT, concerning for
early obstruction, but MRCP that was unremarkable (no stenosis,
stone, dilation). 2) TTE was of poor quality due to poor body
habitus, and could not definatively r/o veg
.
Pt has been off of levophed since [**7-18**] 4PM. Pt has been
hemodynamically stable. She was dialyzed today ([**7-20**])via a
temporary right femoral groin line. She needs a new tunneled HD
line for permanent access by IR prior to discharge. However, her
INR is 3.6 today. She has not gotten any vitamin K, need to have
INR <1.5 tunneling line to be placed.

Imaging:
1. Chest Portable AP ([**2128-7-15**])
PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Right-sided dual-lumen dialysis
catheter tip
terminates in the upper SVC. There are low lung volumes. The
heart size is
normal. The aorta remains tortuous and calcified. Increased
pulmonary
vascular markings is suggestive of vascular congestion. No focal

consolidation, large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
identified. No
acute osseous finding is seen.

2. CT with Contrast Abd & Pel ([**2128-7-16**])
-No intra-abdominal or intrapelvic fluid collection or abscess.
No
pulmonary consolidations.
-Severe stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC
around catheter
resulting in extensive lateral and posterior chest wall
collateral flow mostly through the azygos vein. Chronic
occlusion of the left IJ, subclavian and
brachiocephalic veins.
-Cholelithiasis. Mild intrahepatic bile duct dilation and a 10
mm CBD
increased from [**2126**]. This raises concern for choledocholithiasis
and early
obstruction though papillary stenosis is a consideration.
-Chronic renal failure with cystic changes likely secondary to
chronic
dialysis. Right upper pole AML as before.
-Hepatic steatosis.

3. MRI Abd without contrast ([**2128-7-18**])
-Normal tapering common bile duct. No evidence of
choledocholithiasis or
ampullary stenosis. No intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
-Small pancreatic cystic lesions, the largest within the head of
pancreas
measuring 8 mm. Interval follow-up in 12 months recommended to
ensure
stability.
-Bilateral cystic lesions in both kidneys could reflect lithium
nephropathy.
Please correlate with exposure hostory.
-Incidental angiomyolipoma noted in the upper pole of the right
kidney.
-Hemosiderosis of the liver and spleen.

4. Echo ([**2128-7-19**])
Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus. Left ventricular
systolic function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be excluded. Mild LVOT gradient is seen. The
right ventricle is not well seen. There is aortic stenosis that
is probably mild to moderate. Mild aortic regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation seen but image quality means endocarditis cannot
be excluded. If clinically s
