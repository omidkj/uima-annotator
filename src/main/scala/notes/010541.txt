CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS

Reason: Please evaluate for dissection
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old woman s/p thoracic aortic stent graft with back
pain.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for dissection
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 73-year-old woman with thoracic aortic stent graft with
back pain evaluate for dissection.

COMPARISON: [**2168-11-24**] and [**2168-11-17**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector contiguous axial images of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis were obtained prior to and following the
administration of intravenous contrast.

CTA: No aortic dissection is identified. The patient has a
thoracic aortic stent graft at the level of the aortic arch
which excludes the previously seen eccentric aneurysm at this
level. The maximal diameter of this focal eccentric nonenhancing
aneurysm in the AP dimension is 3.8 cm, relatively unchanged
from the prior two studies.

Again seen are atherosclerotic changes in the abdominal aorta.
The celiac, superior mesenteric artery, both renal arteries,
inferior mesenteric arteries, and common iliac arteries are
patent.

CT CHEST: There are small axillary lymph nodes bilaterally, with
fatty hila measuring up to 7 mm in short-axis diameter. There
are small shotty mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as a small
right hilar lymph node measuring up to 7 mm in diameter series 3
image 23. Largest mediastinal lymph node measures 7 x 9 mm
(series 3 image 19) is right paratracheal in location. No
pericardial effusions are present.

Lung windows demonstrate extensive emphysematous changes in both
lungs, and a small left pleural effusion is seen. There is small
amount of basilar atelectasis present at the left base. There
are dependent changes seen in the portions of the left upper and
right upper lobes.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The gallbladder, liver, pancreas,
spleen, adrenal glands are normal in appearance. Small cyst
(6mm) is seen in the interpolar region of the left kidney
(series 3 image 60), there is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter
on either side.

There is no free air or free fluid in the pelvis. No enlarged
retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present. The caliber of the
loops of small and large bowel are normal in appearance.

CT PELVIS: There is air seen in the bladder of uncertain origin.
The bladder is not fully distended. The uterus and visualized
adnexa are normal. The sigmoid colon is not distended. There is
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon without diverticulitis.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No aortic dissection. No evidence of endoleak. Stable
appearance of the stent graft at the level of the aortic arch.
2. Emphysema.

stent graft, n/w chest pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?interval change
CHEST TWO VIEWS ON [**12-18**]

HISTORY: Status post carotid bypass and thoracic aorta stent
graft, now with chest pain.

REFERENCE EXAM: [**12-15**]

FINDINGS: There has been interval removal the endotracheal tube
and skin staples. The appearance of the aortic graft is
unchanged. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
unchanged. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. No focal
infiltrates identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year-old woman who presented to [**Hospital1 **] Center's cardiac surgery clinic with
progressive dyspnea on exertion and a chest CT revealing a
saccular aortic aneurysm.  She was taken to the operating room
on [**2168-12-13**] and underwent a carotid to carotid bypass graft with
endovascular thoracic abdominal aneurysm repair with a 34 x mm
15 graft.  This procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 22423**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **].  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was
transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgiccal
intensive care unit.

In the surgical intensive care unit she failed intitial
extubation on post operative day 1 requiring re-intubation.  On
post-operative day 2 she was successfully extubated but was
hoarse.  She was seen in consultation by the speech and swallow
service, which suggested that her post-op dysphagia was due to
post-op swelling. Her pressors were weaned and she was gently
diuresed.  By post-operative day 4 she was ready for transfer to
the step-down floor.

On the step-down floor Ms. [**Known lastname **] was seen in consultation by
physical therapy.  Her oxygen was weaned and she was further
diuresed.  She was seen a second time by speech and swallow,
which recommended advancing her diet as tolerated as she no
longer exhibited signs of aspiration.  By post operative day 7
she was ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility.
