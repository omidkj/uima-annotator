History of Present Illness:
PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] (ATRIUS)

Mr. [**Known lastname 66658**] is a 42 year old man with history of chronic back
pain, spinal stenosis, on chronic pain medications, as well as
hypertension, morbid obesity, and asthma, who is admitted with
acute exacerbation of his back pain. He reports that the day
prior to admission, he had returned from running errands and
started to watch the basketball game. He was lying down when he
noticed pain in his neck radiating down the spine to his
feet/legs. The pain was so intense that he had to rush to the
car (he reports that his son carried him to the car). He has
numbness and tingling in his feet but is able to ambulate with
severe pain. This had never happened before. He says that he has
had surgery in the past, and has seen multiple surgeons for

While in the ED, triage vitals were T99F, BP 170/117, HR 110, RR
14, Sat 97%. He complained of chest pain, sharp, substernal,
without radiation or associated symptoms. CXR and CTA showed no
obvious etiology. He was given Toradol x 1 and dilaudid x 1 and
subsequently admitted to the hospital for further pain control.

All systems were reviewed and are negative except as noted
above.

Additional information was obtained from the PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has a long
history of acute episodes of back pain; most of which do not
result in admission. He is quite concerned about the "tumors" in
his back (epidural lipomatosis), but his most recent MRI shows
no evidence of cord compression. He has a narcotics contract
with her.

.
CTA: No evidence of acute aortic syndromes.
.
CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes
have
decreased. Newly occurred bilateral basal areas of opacity.
Although
atelectasis is the most likely diagnosis, early pneumonia cannot
be excluded.  Short-term PA and lateral confirmatory radiographs
should be performed.
.
MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE: Vertebral body height, signal, and
alignment are preserved. There is no STIR signal abnormality.
There is no disc herniation. There is prominent posterior
epidural fat, unchanged, suggestive of epidural lipomatosis.
There is thickening and calcification of the ligamentum flavum
at several levels.
There is no abnormal STIR signal in the paraspinal soft tissues.
The thoracic cord is normal in signal and morphology.
Sag T2 weighted images of the cervical spine demonstrate normal
sagittal
alignment and no cord signal abnormality. There is right neural
foraminal
narrowing at T2-3 due to prominent calcified ligamentum flavum.

MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE: Vertebral body height and sagittal
alignment are
preserved. The conus terminates at L1. There is normal signal
within the
conus medullaris and the cauda equina. There have been prior
laminectomies at L3 through S1. The axial images are overall
degraded by motion. There is no high-grade canal or foraminal
stenosis. Disc bulges are suggested at L4-5 and L5-S1 which do
not cause significant canal or foraminal stenosis. There does
not appear to be abnormal enhancement after the administration
of gadolinium.  Given the motion degradation on the axial, it is
difficult to discern the epidural scarring described on the
prior MRI. There are some foci of susceptibility artifact in the
surgical postoperative bed at the L5-S1 level which appears
unchanged. There is subcutaneous STIR signal abnormality in the
area of the lumbar spine which is nonspecific.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of infection involving the thoracic or lumbar spine.
No evidence of drainable fluid collection. Stable post-surgical
changes at L3 through S1.
.
ANKLE FILM:
Three views of the foot and three of the ankle show no evidence
of
acute fracture or dislocation. There is a small bony
opacification projected between the medial aspect of the talus
and the inferior projection of the medial malleolus. This most
likely represents a sequela of previous injury.  No associated
soft tissue swelling is seen.
Small inferior calcaneal spur is seen. There is also a spur
arising from the posterosuperior aspect of the navicular.
.
SHOULDER FILM:
No previous images. Degenerative changes are seen about the
glenohumeral joint. The acromioclavicular joint is not
adequately assessed on any view presented, and the possibility
of subluxation cannot be excluded.
.
CTA:
1. Normal thoracic aorta with no evidence of dissection.
2. One perifissural nodule and one subpleural nodule measuring 4
mm each. If the patient has no risk factors for malignancy no
further follow up is
required.



Brief Hospital Course:
42 male with multiple medical problems including obstructive
sleep apnea and chronic back pain admitted on [**2110-5-2**] for
worsening back pain with hospital course complicated by fever
and altered mental status.
.
BACK PAIN: Patient with a longstanding history of chronic lower
back
after sustaining a fall s/p multiple spinal surgeries at outside
hospital admitted with worsening back pain with relatively
normal neurological exam. He was initially admitted to the [**Location 66659**] service and later transferred to the West service
following a brief ICU stay. During this hospital course, he
spiked a temperature to 103 requiring a cooling blanket. The
neurosurgery service was consulted for concern for infectious
spinal processes given his back pain and fever. An MRI was
performed that showed no evidence of fluid collection or
infectious spinal process or any other process requiring acute
intervention. His pain was controlled with his home dose
narcotics in addition to ketorolac, which he received for 48
hours, and lidocaine patch. On discharge he was ambulating
without assistance and felt his back pain was well controlled.
He declined follow up with the pain service to manage his back
pain as an outpatient.
.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: He was given higher doses of opiates in
addition to his home neurontin and benzodiazepines for pain
control. He became obtunded responding only to sternal rub. His
mentus improved with narcan and being transiently placed on
Bipap given his history of obstructive sleep apnea. Blood gas in
the ICU was consistent with chronic respiratory acidosis. He was
transferred to the ICU given his fever, worsening back pain, and
altered mental status. His mental status slow
