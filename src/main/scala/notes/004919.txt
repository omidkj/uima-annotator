History of Present Illness:
85-year-old female with history of pulmonary fibrosis, recurrent
UTIs pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary embolism (pulmonary
embolism and DVT in [**2192-12-13**] s/p IVC filter and six months
of warfarin stopped in [**Month (only) 205**] and then restarted in [**9-/2193**] given
admission with worsening hypoxia and persistent Pulm emboli thus
re-bridged to coumadin) presenting to the emergency department
with worsening weakness, increased oxygen requirement. (Although
baseline O2 requirement is 6L O2 and patient known to desat to
mid 80s at home).  Over the last 24 hours patient has had to
titrate up her oxygen. Patient has had a mild cough, non
productive, and stuffy left nostril, but otherwise, denies
fevers or chills, nor chest pain and is currently on cefdinir
for UTI although unclear where this U/A was taken from (likely
PCP's office). Sick contact includes daughter whom she lives
with who has URI sx.

In ED initial VS were  98.2  77  127/60  24 100% NRB
Labs were remarkable for [**Year (4 digits) 263**] 2.2, Cre 1.4. (1.1), Hct 30 (27),
Lactate 4.4, neg Trop.
Imaging: CXR - wet read, no PNA
EKG: no acute changes from prior
.
In the ER, patient was hypoxic to 80% on 6L of nasal cannula. ED
team was concerned for PNA despite no findings of such on CXR
wet read as well as UTI although no U/A sent and no symptoms and
given lactate of 4.2 began treating for presumed urosepsis +/-
PNA source w/ levoflox and cefepime. Vanc not given while down
in ED. Patient refuses foley catheter.

IMAGING:
[**2193-10-22**] CXR: FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest
were obtained.  There are
relatively low lung volumes.  Diffuse increased interstitial
markings are
grossly similar to prior, consistent with patient's pulmonary
fibrosis, with
possible of overlying edema.  No large pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is
seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable
compared to
[**2193-7-12**] and [**2193-9-29**].  The patient is rotated in position.
There is severe
compression of an upper lumbar spine vertebral body, also seen
on the prior
study from [**2193-1-10**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10113**] is an 85 year old female with history of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, recurrent UTIs, pulmonary hypertension and
pulmonary embolism (pulmonary embolism and DVT in [**2192-12-13**]
s/p IVC filter and six months of warfarin stopped in [**Month (only) 205**] and
then restarted in [**9-/2193**] given admission with persistent
Pulmonary emboli) who presented with concern for fatigue,
increased O2 requirement at home.  No etiology was found for an
second process in her lungs, rather it is possible she has had
mild progression of her severe pulmonary fibrosis.
.
# Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF): Previous notes designate
that she easily drops sats with minimal pertubations, which she
was doing also during admission.  No other exacerbating factors
were found including no obvious worsening pulmonary edema on
CXR, no fevers, WBC elevation, or productive cough to suggest
pneumonia, urine was clean without evidence of urinary tract
infection.  She did have copious watery nasal discharge,
consistent with a viral upper respiratory infection.  This made
it difficult for her to tolerate nasal cannula for oxygen
delivery because her nostrils were plugged.  Most likely dx is
baseline severe hypoxemia due to IPF with mild pertubation from
a viral upper respiratory track infection.
    Her primary pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] was [**Last Name (STitle) 653**] and
he agreed that this was most likely due to progression of IPF.
He wanted to leave her prednisone at 20 mg daily rather than
increase the dose because it would not ultimately change her
prognosis or symptoms.  Also, the MICU team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**]
spoke with the patient about the advantages of hospice for her
end-stage pulmonary disease.  She was continued on the bactrim
prophylaxis since on steroids.
.
# Lactic acidosis: Appears most likely due to dehydration plus
metformin given hemoconcentration, no leukocytosis or fevers and
the chronic elevations.  Her primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name (NI) 653**]
about changing to another oral hypoglycemic or even insulin.  He
felt these would be appropriate options and added that her high
sugars are only due to prednisone therapy.  She was started on
glipizide 5 mg daily for this and metformin was discontinued.
.
# Recent diagnosis of cystitis: Was on outpt cefdinir 300 mg [**Hospital1 **]
started on [**10-21**].  Repeat urinalysis here showed clearing of the
urine and urine culture was contaminated.  She was given
ceftriaxone while in house and then discharged to complete
cefdinir therapy.
