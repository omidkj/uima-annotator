Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
85 yo male being transferred on [**4-11**]/6 from OSH after he had
dizziness, syncope, and had fallen to the ground outside the
[**Hospital1 1474**] VA.  A head CT showed subarachnoid blood.  Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  He denies any HA, dizziness,
lightheadedness prior to syncope and states that he "just
dropped" and landed on his face.  Wife witnessed this and states
there was no seizure activity.  At the time of this event,
patient was on coumadin and plavix after having a coronary
artery stent placed at the VA on [**2104-3-7**].

Pertinent Results:
[**4-16**]: ECHO
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The  right atrium is moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity  size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion  abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic  function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
aorticvalve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**4-14**]: CXR: Moderate pulmonary edema and moderate right and small
left pleural effusion along with cardiomegaly and mediastinal
vascular engorgement have all worsened.  Focal consolidation at
the apex of the left lung could be pneumonia, appearing since
[**4-10**].
.
[**4-12**] C-spine: Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and grade 1
retrolisthesis of C5 on C6 are stable during flexion and
extension.
.
[**2104-4-10**]: trauma CT torso: No evidence of acute traumatic injury
or active extravasation. Large right pleural effusion with
associated atelectasis. 1.4 cm cystic-appearing lesion is seen
in the head of the pancreas. Followup imaging is recommended
when patient is stable
.
[**2104-4-10**] CT head:
1.  Large subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and
suprasellar cisterns.  While this may relate to subarachnoid
hemorrhage secondary to trauma and anticoagulation, a CT
angiogram would be necessary to exclude underlying aneurysm.
2.  Third and lateral ventricular dilatation, raising
possibility of early obstructive hydrocephalus.
3.  Chronic small vessel ischemic change and involutional
change, with old right cerebellar hemispheric infarct.
.
[**2104-4-11**] CTA: per report showed no aneurysm, official report
pending.


Brief Hospital Course:
# SAH - CT scan in the ED showed large subarachnoid hemorrhage
in the basal cisterns and suprasellar cisterns.  On admission to
trauma surgery team with neurosurgery consulting patient's
anticoagulation was reversed.  He was admitted to the trauma
SICU and started on dilantin.  A CTA of the head showed no
evidence of aneurysm, bleed was likely due to trauma from fall
and anticoagulation.  Patient's neurologic status was stable and
without deficit.  He completed one week of dilantin without any
evidence of seizure activity.  Patient will need to schedule a
follow up appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23813**] in neurosurgery 6 week from
discharge.
.
# SOB - [**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by shortness
of breath attributed to CHF and chronic pleural effusions.  He
was ruled out for an MI, treated for possible aspiration
pneumonia with levofloxacin and flagyl, and had a
diagnostic/therapeutic right sided thoracentesis.  ECHO showed
EF 60-65%.  Pulmonary felt his symptoms were due to fluid
overload and the pleural fluid was consistent with a transudate
with lymphocytic predominance.  The patient was diuresed with
Lasix with improvement in his symptoms.  He will be transferred
to an acute rehab center for further diuresis and weaning from
oxygen.  His daily fluid goal is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1999**] cc/day and may be able
to reduce his lasix dose as he diuresed 1.5 L yesterday on 100
mg Lasix [**Hospital1 **].  Patient should follow up with his outpatient
pulmonologists at the VA for further monitoring and management
of his shortness of breath after discharge from rehab.
.
# CAD - Patient was s/p bare metal stent placement to left
circumflex on [**2104-3-7**] at the [**Hospital1 59561**].  Plavix and aspirin were held
initially due to concern for bleeding.  Patient had episodes of
chest pain during this admission which were not correlated with
any evidence of ischemic injury concerning for clotting of the
stent.  Both plavix and aspirin were restarted after approval by
neurosurgery.  Patient had a troponin leak to 0.07 on [**2104-4-13**],
though his CKs remained normal.  Cardiac medications were
titrated by consulting cardiologists and are as described in d/c
plan.
.
# Syncope - Pt had no further syncopal episodes while
hospitalized, but was noted to have up to 2 second pauses on
telemetry.  He has been on a BB prior to admission and this may
have led to prolonged pause causing his syncopal episode.  Pt's
BB was discontinued permanently per cardiology and pt should
avoid nodal blockers in the future as well.  Pt may benefit from
a pacemaker in the future.
.
# Hypernatremia - Patient was hypernatremic initially, which
resolved with hydration of D5W and remained normal once his diet
was advanced and he was able to take PO liquids.
.
# AF - Patient was in NSR during this hospitalization.  His
coumadin was held throughout.  He can restart his coumadin on
[**2104-5-4**].
.
# Anemia - Hct remained stable, was 30.4 at discharge.
.
# Dysphagia - Pt has had dysphagia for the past few months.  He
had a video swallow which showed mild to moderate oral, mild
pharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids which were
prevented by chin tuck maneuver.  Patient was started on a thin
liquids/soft solids diet without further aspiration/coughing
episodes.  Pt should have a repeat swallow study done at a later
date to assess for improvement in function.
