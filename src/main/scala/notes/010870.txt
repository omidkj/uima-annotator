Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo with hypertension, hypothyroidism and hx of ESBL
klebsiella urosepsis in the past was admitted with mental status
changes and subjective fevers.
.
# Urosepsis: Admitted with mental status changes which were most
likely attribute to presence of fevers; transferred to the MICU
after development of dyspnea. She was found to have a urinary
tract infection as well as bacteremia with E.coli. E.coli was
sensitive to multiple drugs including Levofloxacin,
Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin, Meropenem, Ceftriaxone and
Ceftazidime, however due to pt's many allergies she was started
on Gentamicin. She did not require intubation, and improved on
Gentamicin. She was transferred to the floor where Gentamicin
was discontinued and Levaquin was started. Pt. tolerated
Levaquin without any difficulty and remained stable without any
changes in mental status. Repeat blood and urine cultures after
initial ones were negative. She is to continue Levaquin for 8
more days for a total of 14days of antibiotic therapy.
.
# NSTEMI: She was evaluated by cardiology upon admission and
started on a heparin infusion. She did not have any new changes
to her EKG and the lateral ST depression noted were old. After
stabilization in MICU for mental status changes and respiratory
distress, heparin infusion was d/c'ed and she was transferred to
the floor. She did not have any events on telemetry or
experience any symptoms of chestpain or shortness of breath
while on the floor. Pt did have an elevation in her troponin
level which peaked at 0.77 and was trending down, 0.21 at
discharge. Cardiology felt demand ischemia vs. NSTEMI was
causing the troponin leak. She was followed by cardiology during
her stay in the hospital. An echo done revealed nml EF, however
inferior wall hypokinesis. P-MIBI done prior to discharge did
not show any defects. She was continued on ASA and Metoprolol
while in house. Pt is to follow up with PCP; Would consider d/c
of HRT due to NSTEMI.
.
#. Altered mental status: Confusion, most likely related to
fevers and urinary tract infection. Pt's mental status improved
on Gentamicin. Her UTI and bacteremia was treated with Levaquin.
She did not have any more episodes while on admission.
.
# Hypertension: Pt was maintained on home dose Atenolol 75mg
daily. She also is on a home regimen of HCTZ. To be continued
upon discharge home.
.
# Anemia: She has had episodes of anemia in the past as evidence
by OMR. She remained hemodynamically stable without evidence of
active bleeding. Did not require any blood transfusions while in
the hospital.
.
# COPD: History of COPD, had PFT's done while in house. Will
need to be followed up by primary care provider.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued her home regimen of Armour Thyroid
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Plts were trending down after admission, had
been on Heparin infusion at the same time. There was the
question of HIT, however low suspicion, no evidence of
thrombosis and Heparin drip was discontinued. Plt level remained
stable.
