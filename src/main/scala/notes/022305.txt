Imaging:
========
CT C-SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no acute malalignment,
prevertebral soft tissue swelling, or acute fracture. There are
severe degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine. The
C4 vertebral body demonstrates a large (approximately 5 mm)
round lucency, which likely represents a large subchondral cyst
with cortical breakthrough at the superior surface, however less
likely consideration is a lytic lesion. There is anterior and
posterior osteophyte formation at all levels, with disc height
loss throughout the cervical spine. At C6-C7, there is severe
disc height loss, with near bone- on-bone appearance. There is
no evidence of indentation of the thecal sac, although CT does
not provide the intrathecal detail comparable to MRI. The lung
apices demonstrate no nodule or other opacity. There is no
submandibular or cervical lymphadenopathy.

IMPRESSION:

1. No fracture or acute malalignment abnormality.
2. No prevertebral soft tissue swelling or other evidence of
acute injury.
3. Round lucency in C4 vertebral body with cortical breakthrough
at superior surface likely represents large subchondral cysts,
but lytic lesion is a less likely possibility.
4. Severe degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no hemorrhage, mass, mass
effect, edema, or shift of normally midline structures.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci with increased bifrontal
CSF space are suggestive of age-related parenchymal atrophy. No
fracture or soft tissue injury is identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or fracture.

Chest XRAY

FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is reviewed
without comparison. Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of
normal, with left ventricular prominence, which could suggest
underlying hypertension. Prominence of the pulmonary vascularity
may suggest pulmonary hypertension, but there is no pulmonary
vascular engorgement or other evidence of pulmonary edema. There
is ill-defined 1-cm nodular opacity in the right perihilar
region. There is no focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
1. 1-cm ill-defined right mid lung nodular opacity, incompletely
evaluated. CT is recommended for further evaluation to exclude
underlying mass.
2. Prominent cardiac silhouette with left ventricular
configuration could suggest underlying hypertension. Prominence
of the pulmonary vasculature, but no evidence of pulmonary
edema.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2112-4-19**] at 10:33:19 AM
Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no
ventricular septal defect. The aortic root is moderately dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate
([**11-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous.
There is probable (partial) mitral leaflet flail. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed j
