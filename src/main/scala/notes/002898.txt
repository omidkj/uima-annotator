Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath for 1 night, productive cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28030**] is an 86 year-old man with a history of
non-ischemic CM (EF 30-35%), hx PAF on coumadin and s/p recent
successful cardioversion [**8-28**] followed by initiation of
amiodarone, and a history of difficult to control volume status
secondary to dietary indiscretion.  He is now presenting with
respiratory distress for one day and found to be in atrial
fibrillation.
.
Over the past few days he has had increased productive cough of
brownish sputum, however, he does mention having this productive
cough at baseline.  He has not noticed any fevers or chills at
home.  Last night was particularly difficult for him to sleep
because he could not lie flat in bed without feeling short of
breath.  He denies ever having to sleep in a chair and says the
he usually lies on 2 pillows.  He feels like he has gained some
weight over the past week or so.  Otherwise he denies any chest
pain or palpitations.  He can not feel when he goes into atrial
fibrillation unless his rate is really quick.
.
In the ED, initial VS T 98, BP 126/72, HR 114, RR 20, O2 91% on
RA.  Exam was notable for bibasilar crackles and irregularly
irregular HR.  EKG showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic
changes.  CXR showed evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion
and ? RLL pneumonia. O2 Sat fell to 85% on RA and he was placed
on high-flow facemask. He received ASA 325 mg, 750 mg IV
levofloxacin, and 1 g IV vancomycin and was admitted to the CCU
for further managment.
.
On review of systems, he does have a history of pulmonary
embolism and is currently anticoagulated.  He denies any prior
history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.
He does have dyspnea on exertion.  No palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
.
CXR [**9-4**]: UPRIGHT AP RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There is increased
opacity in the right lower lobe. There is cephalization of the
pulmonary vasculature. The left lung is relatively well aerated.
There is moderate cardiomegaly, stable. Backrgound prominence of
interstitial markings, consistent with known interstial disease
seen on prior CT is noted, ([**2118-7-17**]).
Aortic arch calcifications are noted. Hilar contours are
unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with more confluent right lower
lung
opacity, concomitant infection in this region cannot be
excluded.
.
CXR [**9-5**]: FINDINGS: Since [**2118-9-4**], increased
opacification of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe
and of the right lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia or less
likely asymmetric pulmonary edema. Unchanged cardiomegaly and
cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature. There is no pleural
effusion, and there is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Increasing lung opacity consistent with pneumonia,
less likely
asymmetric pulmonary edema. Unchanged cardiomegaly and pulmonary
venous
hypertension.
.
EKG [**9-4**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Delayed precordial R wave transition. Non-specific inferolateral
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-8-23**]
the ventricular response is faster.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 86 yo man with a history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p successful
cardioversion [**8-28**] presenting with an acute exacerbation of
chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure and
found to again be in atrial fibrillation.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart
failure:  EF 30-35% on echo [**6-28**].  Given exam, elevated BNP,
CXR, most likely etiology of hypoxia is volume overload.
Precipitant seems to be a combination of dietary indiscretion,
failure to adjust his home furosemide dosing based on his daily
weights, and poorly tolerating atrial fibrillation.  No clear
evidence of infection.  No evidence of ischemia on EKG.
- He responded well to diuresis with Lasix 40mg IV and PO. times
two doses.  He lost about 3 kg from his admission weight and his
dry weight seems to be 95 kg.  His home dose of Lasix was
switched to 40mg once daily from 20mg twice daily.  He was also
advised to follow a low salt diet and give himself an extra dose
of Lasix 40mg if his weight increases 5 pounds above his
baseline dry weight.
- He will also be discharged on his home dose of olmesartan
40mg, spironolactone 25mg daily was started, digoxin 125mcg
every other day was continued.  His home amlodipine was
discontinued. Referral to the Heart Failure Clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] was
done, he will follow-up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP.
