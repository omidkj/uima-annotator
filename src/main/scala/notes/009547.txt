Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Pacemaker pocket infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker explantation [**2107-10-13**]
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intubation

History of Present Illness:
82 y/o male with permanent afib with h/o stroke currently on
warfarin, [**Month/Day/Year **] sinus syndrome s/p single-chamber pacemaker
implantation [**2-/2105**], heart failure, presents with swelling
around site of single chamber st. [**Male First Name (un) **] pm, referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
with concern for pocket infection & plans to explant device.

Pacemaker was placed in [**2105-2-23**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1140**] at [**Hospital3 19345**] for atrial fibrillation w/ [**Hospital3 **] sinus syndrome.  Had
bleeding but no infection.  No recent manipulations.  A few
weeks ago developed swelling and redness at pacemaker site.

Mode of pacer set to VVIR with lower pacing rate of 60 bpm.
Pacing only 11% of the time mostly at night.  Takes warfarin due
to afib with hx of TIA.

[**2107-8-30**] presented to office feeling tired and having dyspnea with
moderate exertion.  Ordered for Lexiscan and Echo.

[**2107-10-5**] echo: LVEF is 42%, mild concentric LVH, left and right
atrium mild mildly dilated.  Mild MR.  Mild septal hypokinesis.
Changed from [**11-3**] echo: LVEF normal 56% with mild concentric
LVH

[**2107-9-27**]: Lexiscan: Normal perfusion, normal systolic function,
negative ECG.

Blood cultures drawn [**9-28**] were negative, ESR 20.  Denies fevers,
chills, rash, decreased appetite, weight loss.

Also complains of orthopnea, edema, PND.  Started on lasix on
[**10-5**] with some improvement in symptoms.  Referred by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5017**] for device explantation.

On arrival to the floor, patient denies any acute complaints.
Mild pacemaker pain.

IMAGING
[**2107-10-11**] CHEST X-RAY
IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of any
prior chest imaging studies.
Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead terminates along the
anterior wall of the right ventricle.  Heart is moderately
enlarged, predominantly left atrial. Mild interstitial
abnormality could be chronic.  There is no appreciable vascular
congestion or any pleural effusion to suggest that it is acute
edema. Right upper costal pleural thickening could be
asbestos-related plaque, but there are no other findings to
suggest asbestos-related diseases.

[**2107-10-13**] CHEST X-RAY
IMPRESSION:  New endotracheal tube in appropriate position.  New
hilar and juxta patchy opacities, compatible with pulmonary
edema.

[**2107-10-13**] TTE
Preoperative:
The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened with fusion between the left and
noncoronary cusps. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.5 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to
moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen with vena contracta
of 0.6 cm. Estimated Ejection Fraction is 40% with moderate
global hypokinesis. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2107-10-13**] at
1000.

Post operative:
There is no pericardial effusion post lead extraction. There is
no evidence of new or worsened tricuspid insufficiency.

[**2107-10-15**] CHEST X-RAY
REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Flash pulmonary edema clinically.
Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to [**10-14**], [**10-13**], [**2107**].

Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Mediastinum is stable.  Minimal
interstitial edema is seen, but no overt alveolar pulmonary
edema is present.  Atelectasis in the left perihilar area has
improved.  No interval increase in pleural effusion or
development of pneumothorax is present.
