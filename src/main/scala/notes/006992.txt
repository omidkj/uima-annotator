Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transesophageal echocardiogram
EGD
Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
74 yo M with history of cardiomyopathy (EF 45%), atrial
fibrillation, HTN, CKD with ICD for h/o arrhythmia presenting
after 6 episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation leading
to ICD firing.  Patient was on his way to [**Hospital3 4107**] today
for a scheduled colonoscopy when he became drowsy, vomited and
his ICD fired.  It fired a total of 3 times before emergency
services arrived.  It fired again in the ambulance, and twice in
the ED.
.
Patient reports that over the last several weeks, he has been
feeling "lousy", reporting fatigue, loss of appetite and
weakness.  He saw his PCP who ran several tests and recommended
a colonoscopy.  Colonoscopy was scheduled for [**7-30**] and patient
prepped the night before.  However, he was extremely weak and
could not stop having diarrhea and cancelled the colonoscopy.
The procedure was re-scheduled for [**10-8**] with plan for patient to
be admitted the night before for bowel prep and ?2U blood
transfusion.  Patient reports that he had not eaten for >24hrs
as he was concerned he might "get the call" to come in for the
colonoscopy.
.
Patient's ICD was placed in [**2150**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] after he "flat-lined."
He has only been shocked once, which was approximately 1 week
following original ICD placement and reports that it was because
he "didn't have enough sotalol." Of note, patient had a
generator change of his ICD on [**2162-7-14**], and has "not felt right"
since.
.
Patient reports a 31lb weight loss over the past 4 months which
was partly intentional, but he believes he "went overboard,"
losing more than intended.  He denies chest pain or palpitations
recently, but does report shortness of breath.  He denies
orthopnea or PND.  He has noted worsening fluid accumulation in
his lower extremities.
.
Per report of the patient, he had a stool guaiac which was
positive which prompted the colonoscopy.  However, patient
denies any melena or hematochezia.  In addition, he has not
noted any changes in the caliber of his stool, and denies
abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.  He denies dysuria or
hematuria.  He does report recent nocturia, urgency and
occasional overflow incontinence.
.
In the ED, patient had two episodes of witnessed Vtach and was
unresponsive and shocked by ICD.  12 lead EKG captured override
pacing of monomorphic VT decompensating into ventricular
fibrillation during the first episode.  The precipitating rhythm
was not captured.  During the second event, 12 lead EKG captured
a PVC decompensating into VF.  Patient was started on a
lidocaine drip.  His potassium and magnesium were low and were
repleted.  Patient was seen by the EP team who increased his
pacer settings to a rate of 80 and the patient was admitted to
the CCU for further management.

EKG: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing at rate of

fibrillation.
.
IMAGING:
-CXR ([**2162-10-7**]):  Retrocardiac density. In light of lack of
respiratory
symptomology, this likely represents atelectasis, although an
early developing focus of pneumonia or possibly aspiration
cannot be excluded.
.
-CXR ([**2162-10-11**]):  Upright PA and lateral views of the chest are
unchanged from prior. Again seen is a retrocardiac density which
could represent atelectasis or pneumonia in the correct clinical
setting. Left pacemaker wires course through the brachiocephalic
and terminate in right atrium and right ventricle. Mild aortic
tortuosity. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged without
evidence of pulmonary edema. No definite pleural effusion.
Incidental note is made of pericardial calcifications.
.
-Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2162-10-8**]):  The left atrium is
moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. LV systolic function
appears moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30
percent) secondary to extensive apical akinesis, hypokinesis of
the interventricular septum, and marked mechanical dyssynchrony
(pacing vs left bundle branch block). The right ventricular free
wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
with depressed free wall contractility (the apical half of the
right ventricular free wall is akinetic and aneurysmally
dilated). There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertensi
