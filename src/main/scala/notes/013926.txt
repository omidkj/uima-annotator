Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Keflex / Clindamycin / Vancomycin / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
88F h/o CHF, Afib on coumadin, AAA s/p repair p/w worsening
productive cough x 4 weeks associated with mild dyspnea over the
past 24 hours. Her cough has been persistent with yellow-white
sputum. No fevers or chills reported. Denies CP, diaphoresis,
nausea, or vomiting. Denies sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] h/o smoking or
asthma. The patient has chronic LE swelling that is unchanged.
Last saturday was discharged from rehab ([**Hospital3 537**]). In the
ED, T 101.1, RR of 20, O2sat 88% on RA -> 99 % on 4L. Exam
notable for rales and poor air movement. CXR consistent with RLL
PNA and minimal CHF and started on levaquin for presumed CAP.
LENIs neg for DVT. Also noted to have diffuse fine maculopapular
rash (?allergic reaction) although no new meds, foods, or skin
irritants and was given 60mg prednisone. Patient reports rash
present for approx 3 weeks. U/A checked but was dirty sample.
Admitted to medicine for further management.
.
Transferred to MICU on HD #3 with increased rate of breathing.
Her ABG at that time was consistent with chronic CO2 retention
(7.42/72/175 w/ HCO3 38 taken earlier in day). In MICU,
continued on levoflox, and metronidazole added for concern of
aspiration. Also started on steroid taper. Negative speech and
swallow eval. Neuro called to evaluate known myopathy and
possible contribution to chronic hypoventilation. NIF borderline
at -25. Of note, no h/o smoking or asthma. The patient has
chronic LE swelling that is unchanged. On [**2138-2-16**] she was
discharged from rehab ([**Hospital3 537**]). Stabilized in MICU and
transferred back to the floor.

ECG: Atrial fibrillation, 105 bpm, LAD, IVCD, nonspecific ST-T
changes
.
CXR ([**2-21**]): Since most recent film, there is new opacification
involving a large segment of the right lower lobe containing air
bronchograms and probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is slight prominence to the right main pulmonary artery as
noted on prior CT, which may be reflective of underlying
pulmonary hypertension.  Left lung remains clear, and there is
no evidence of
pneumothorax.  Heart size is enlarged but unchanged as is
calcification within the tortuous thoracic aorta and a large
hiatus hernia. IMPRESSION: 1)  Right lower lobe pneumonia.
Cardiomegaly with no evidence of failure. 2)  Hiatal hernia.
.
LENIs, bilateral ([**2-21**]): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
either lower extremity.
.
Prior studies -
.
TTE ([**2137-8-18**]): EF>55%
The left atrium is elongated. There is an echodensity seen
posterior to left atrium in some views that may represent an
extracardiac mass. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There
is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
88F h/o CHF, AFib, s/p AAA repair p/w RLL pneumonia.
.
# PNA: Hypoxic with RLL opacity on CXR at presentation. Started
on levoquin in ED for CAP, but given patient coming from recent
rehab setting and multiple recent hospital admissions there was
concern for hospital-acquired pathogens. Diagnostic sputum
culture unable to be obtained. Negative LENIs in ED, low
suspicion for PE. Thought to have possibly aspirated on HD#3
prior to MICU transf
