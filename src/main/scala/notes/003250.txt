Reports:
Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated
three-vessel disease. The LMCA had a 30% distal stenosis. The
mid-LAD
had serial 90% stenoses. The LCx was patent, but a large first
obtuse
marginal branch had serial 90% stenoses. The RCA had serial 90%
stenoses
in its proximal and middle portion.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial blood
pressure.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three-vessel coronary artery disease.
.
CXR PA/LAT: Diffuse perihilar opacities and vascular congestion
have resolved. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. There
are no
pleural effusions. Chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
is stable
since [**2148**].
.
ECHO: Overall left ventricular ejection fraction is normal (LVEF
65%). However, the basal segment of the inferior wall and the
apex are hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Intra-op echo [**2157-6-1**]:
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results on [**2157-6-1**] at 1030am.

Post bypass

Patient is on phenylephrine and is AV paced. Biventricular
systolic function is unchanged. Mild mitral regurgitation
present. Aorta is intact post decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 72yo gentleman who presented to the ED with a
hypertensive emergency and ruled in for NSTEMI by EKG and
enzymes.  Cardiac cath revealed multi-vessel disease and cardiac
surgery consultation was requested.  The patient underwent the
routine preoperative workup.  He was taken to the operating room
on [**2157-6-1**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass x3
LIMA-LAD, SVG to Oobtuse marginal and SVG to PDA.  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was used for surgical
antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1 found the patient extubated,
alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight.  He was restarted on his preoperative  medication
Lisinopril but at a lower dose given marginal systolic blood
pressure in the 80's.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for blood sugar management and his insulin
regimen was changed to Lantus.  He is to follow up Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 57318**] as
an outpatient for further adjustments in insulin.
By the time of discharge on POD #5 the patient was ambulating
with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was cleared for discharge to
[**Hospital3 **] rehab in good condition with appropriate follow
up instructions.
