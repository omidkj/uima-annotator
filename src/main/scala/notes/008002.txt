ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2121-11-28**] 3:31 PM
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)
Reason: evaluation for RUQ with elevated lipase and amylase
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old woman with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluation for RUQ with elevated lipase and amylase
INDICATION: Status post CABG with elevated lipase and amylase.
COMPARISONS: None.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The gallbladder is unremarkable without
evidence of stones. The liver shows no focal or textural
abnormalities. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary
dilatation. The portal vein is patent with appropriate
hepatopetal flow. The right kidney measures 12.0 cm. The left
kidney measures 11.9 cm. There are no stones or hydronephrosis.
Evaluation of the pancreas is limited as only the head was
visualized. The spleen is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No cholelithiasis.
2. Unremarkable but limited examination of the abdomen as the
pancreatic body and tail were not evaluated.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. PFO is present.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Eccentric MR jet. Severe (4+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:

N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is dilated.
2. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen
at rest. A small secundum type ASD IS SEEN
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Echogenicity
noted in the descending aortic distal to the arch, consistent
with a intra-aortic balloon pump.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen with noted restricted posterior leaflet motion. Anterior
leaflet length in 2.0cm and the Posterior leaflet length in
1.0cm with a C-[**Month (only) **] distance of 2.4 cm.
8. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
9. There is a small pericardial effusion.
10. There is a large right sided pleural effusion.

POST-BYPASS:
1. Patient is on an epinephrine infusion along with small doses
of phenylephrine.
2. Normal RV systolic function.
3. Overall LVEF is 40%. There is some mild improvement of
lateral wall functions.
4. There is a mitral annulus ring seen and it is stable and
functioning well with no residual MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
5. Thoracic Aortic contour is intact.
6. Intact interatrial septum.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
