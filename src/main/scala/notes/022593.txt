Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
52 y/o male w/ PMHx nonischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 30%-35%,
Type 1 DM, Hep C who presents with shortness of breath and chest
pain.
.
Per patient, he was feeling in his usual state of health until
he smoked crack 2 days ago.  Since that time, he complains of
progressive shortness of breast, substernal chest pain similar
to prior episodes of heart failure. Denies any cough, wheezing,
fevers or other symptoms of systemic illness.  No peripheral
edema, weight gain, medication noncompliance or dietary
indescretion.
.
Of note, patient has had 2 similar episodes of dyspnea requiring
intubation, most recently on [**2112-12-8**] at [**Hospital1 18**].  On recent
hospital stay, he was initially diagnosed with CHF/ pulmonary
edema but CT chest showed multifocal PNA.  He was treated with
broad spectrum antibiotics and in less than 2 weeks, respiratory
status and CXR had returned to baseline.
.
On arrival to the ED, initial VS 101 126/76 25 100% NIPPV.  Labs
showed leukocytosis to 11.7, BNP of 4942 with mild troponin
elevation to 0.03.  EKG showed diffuse ST depressions, CXR with
patchy bilateral infiltrates.  Patient was treated for
presumptive CHF exacerbation with nitro gtt, lasix with
resultant 2L urine output.  Patient was able to be weaned
transiently from BiPAP to 6LNC but desaturated to mid 80%.
Placed back on NIPPV and transferred to the CCU for further
care.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient dyspneic and unable to complete
full sentances.  He denies any current chest pain or cough.

.
On review of systems, he complains of chronic bilateral knee
pain.  He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

MICROBIOLOGIC DATA:
[**2196-1-10**] BAL bronchial fluid - negative AFB, negative culture,
PCP negative, Legionella negative
[**2196-1-16**] MRSA screen - negative
.
IMAGING:
[**2196-1-16**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Diffuse bilateral severe
parenchymal opacities, similar to that seen previously in
[**2195-11-19**] with multifocal pneumonia. These findings are more
consistent with multifocal pneumonia, supperimposed pulmonary
edema is possible.
.
[**2196-1-16**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Diffuse bilateral airspace
opacities, predominantly of ground-glass pattern, with areas of
more confluent consolidations. The distribution of disease is
nearly identical to the prior CT; however, it is noted that
there was interval resolution of these abnormalities (see chest
radiograph [**2195-12-30**]). Based on these findings, the
pulmonary parenchymal abnormality is felt likely to reflect
re-exposure an [**Doctor Last Name 360**] causing a reactive hypersensitivity
pneumonitis or possibly an eosinophilic pneumonitis. Pulmonary
edema is not considered likely given the distribution. Atypical
infection such as PCP cannot be excluded. Bulky mediastinal
lymphadenopathy is unchanged when compared to the prior study
and is likely reactive. Small bilateral pleural effusions,
similar in appearance to the prior study. Small pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION: 52M with a PMH significant for non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (LVEF 30%-35%), insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus, hepatitis C infection, HTN, HLD, schizophrenia and
depression who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory distress
found to have bilaterally diffuse airspace opacities with
ground-glass appearance on CT chest imaging with suspected
component of CHF exacerbation, in the setting of recent illicit
substance use.

# DIFFUSE, BILATERAL LUNG OPACIFICATION AND ACUTE RESPIRATORY
DECOMPENSATION - His initial presentation was concerning for
pulmonary edema vs. multifocal pneumonia vs. hypersensitivity
pneumonitis. He had a similar presentation in [**2195-11-19**]
thought to be secondary to multifocal pneumonia, although rapid
radiographic resolution in less than 2-weeks at that time was
more consistent with crack lung. Per the ED, he improved
symptomatically on BiPAP, Nitroglycerin gtt and a Lasix gtt
which made a component of decompensated non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy a likely superimposed diagnosis. He diuresed
roughly 2L on transfer from the cardiac and medical ICUs to the
floor which marked improvement in oxygenation status. He was
weaned from a non-rebreather to 1L of oxygen via nasal cannula -
ultimately on room air upon discharge. A CT chest was obtained
showing diffuse bilateral airspace opacities, predominantly of
ground-glass pattern, with areas of more confluent
consolidations. The pulmonary parenchymal abnormality was felt
likely to reflect re-ex
