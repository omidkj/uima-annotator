Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
IVC filter placement
Chest tube placement
Tracheostomy
PEG placement

History of Present Illness:
57yoF w/extensive CA burden in lungs from metastatic cervical
adenocarcinoma, on 4L of O2 at home, who p/w acute SOB and
hemoptysis after cyberknife treatment. Two hours into her
treatment the day of admission, she experienced worsening
dyspnea and coughed up phlegm and approximately 30cc of blood.
She apparently had been having episodes of hemoptysis every few
days. A respiratory code was called, and she was stabilized on a
NRB mask sating in 90s.

In the ED, she was tachycardic to 120s-130s (sinus tachycardia)
on EKG. She was otherwise hemodynamically stable w/sbp 116-120.
She required intubation due to hypoxia. A CT chest was performed
showing multiple bilateral subsegmental PEs. IP was consulted
for PEs and recent h/o hemoptysis. They felt that the risks were
greater than benefits in anticoagulating pt. Thus, she was not
heparinized. She did receive stress dose steroids and
Ceftriaxone/Flagyl/Levofloxacin for empiric treatment of
postobstructive PNA.

She was admitted to the ICU for further care.

Significant labs during hospital course:
Hct 34 on admission, down to 26 after hemoptysis.  Drifted down
to 22 and has been stable.

INR 1.2

Platelets 170-270 up until [**2133-1-16**].  Labs not checked for several
days, then platelets noted to be 95 on [**2133-1-20**].

WBC 9.4 on admission, drifted down to 3.9, was never neutropenic
in house.

PF4 sent, found to be positive.

Cr 0.8 on admission, down to 0.5 but then acutely increased to
1.0 [**1-22**], renal function otherwise normal in house.

*************RADIOLOGY
[**2133-1-9**] CT-A
1. Stable large metastatic lesions throughout the lungs.
2. Left lower lobe segmental pulmonary emboli.
3. New left lingular atelectasis.
4. Worsened right upper lobe ground-glass and airspace patchy
opacity which could represent developing infection,
post-inflammatory changes, or atelectasis.
5. Nasogastric tube tip coiled within the esophagus. Recommend
replacement.
6. Endotracheal tube tip approximately 8 cm from the carina.
Recommend advancing approximately 4 cm.
7. No evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2133-1-9**]
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes as above.
Consider advancing endotracheal tube at least 4 cm for optimal
placement. Nasogastric tube needs repositioning.

CT Head [**2133-1-9**]:
Limited evaluation due to recirculation of intravenous contrast
from previous CTA chest. Cannot exclude small subarachnoid or
extraaxial hemorrhages. No obvious evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect.

[**1-10**] IVCgram:
Successful placement of OptEase IVC filter immediately below
renal veins.

Renal US [**1-23**]:
The right kidney measures 10.5 cm in its long axis and the left
kidney measures 12.7 cm. The left collecting system shows mild
hydronephrosis. The ureter could not be assessed being obscured
by overlying bowel gas. Right kidney is normal. No focal mass
lesions or calculi identified. There is an indwelling Foley
catheter in the urinary bladder which was empty at the time of
the examination.

CXR [**1-27**]:
Comparison with [**2133-1-23**]. A new large left pneumothorax
causes some tension as evidenced by slight tracheal buckling to
the right and hyperlucency of the right medial costophrenic
angle. The massive pulmonary metastases are unchanged; right
lung shows no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position. Osseous structures
appears similar.

CT Chest w/o contrast [**1-29**]:
1. Slight decrease in the overall size of the multiple soft
tissue masses with multiple areas of internal air within the
mass, most likely related to recent treatment.
2. Small loculated left apical pneumothorax that might be
related to air- collections in the left upper lobe mass.
3. New small left pleural effusion.
4. Unchanged mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
5. Splenomegaly. Mild left hydronephrosis.

CXR [**2-1**]:
Small left pneumothorax may be present, but not appreciably
changed. Subcutaneous emphysema in the adjacent left chest wall
is stable. Left pleural catheter unchanged in position. Aside
from the large masses in both lungs, the lungs are grossly
clear. Heart size normal. Tracheostomy tube in standard
placement. No right pleural abnormality.

CXR s/p chest placed to water seal [**2133-2-2**]:
There is no appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Subcutaneous
emphysema in the left chest wall is stable.  Large lung masses
show little
interval change except for recent cavitation.  Tracheostomy tube
in standard placement.  Left PIC line tip projects over the
junction of the
brachiocephalic veins.  Heart size normal.

Patient had multiple blood, sputum, BAL, and urine cultures sent
during her admission.  She never grew a clinically significant
pathogen from any of her cultures.

Brief Hospital Course:
57yoF w/ adenocarcinoma of the cervix w/known extensive lung
metastases who p/w respiratory failure in the setting of
hemoptysis at cyberknife therapy, found to have new bilateral
subsegmental pulmonary emboli.

#. Respiratory failure
Felt to be multifactorial, including very large pulmonary masses
with possibility of bleeding or inflammation from radiation, PE,
post obstructive pneumonia, and anxiety.  Bandemia on
presentation suggestive of possible infection.  Ms. [**Known lastname 69069**] was
treated with a burst of steroids for possible post-radiation
edema as well as a course of antibiotics (vanc, zosyn, and
flagyl) for possible post-obstructive pneumonia; antibiotics
were stopped when the team decided she did not have an
infectious picture.  Multiple cultures were never positive.  She
was not a candidate for systemic anticoagulation because of the
concern that her tumor might erode into her pulmonary artery,
making her a high bleeding risk.
