CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever, sore throat and confusion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 41 year-old
female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary
artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency, antiphospholipid
syndrome, scleroderma, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, and
diastolic congestive heart failure initially presented to
[**Hospital1 69**] for fever and change in
mental status on [**2151-12-13**].  While on the medical floor the
plan was to do a lumbar puncture, however, the patient was
found to have a high INR so she needed to be transfused with
4 units of fresh frozen platelets prior to the lumbar
puncture.  After receiving the 4 units of fresh frozen
platelets, the patient began having difficulty breathing
secondary to pulmonary edema.  Therefore on [**2151-12-14**] she was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for a BiPAP.
While in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was diuresed and
then weaned down to nasal cannula oxygen.  The lumbar
puncture was eventually performed, which was negative.  A CT
of the chest was done, revealing bilateral lower lobe opacity
consistent with pneumonia and/or pulmonary edema.  The
patient was started on Levaquin.  Infectious disease consult
team then recommended Doxycycline for Ehrlichiosis.
Vancomycin and Zosyn was also recommended for nasochromial
pneumonia coverage.  Her last fever was on [**2151-12-19**] morning
with a temperature of 102 Fahrenheit.  On [**2151-12-20**] the
patient was then transferred back to the medical floor.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE MEDICAL FLOOR FROM
THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  Temperature 97.3.  Blood pressure
138/78.  Pulse 84.  Respiratory rate 20. 96% on 3.5 liters
O2.  HEENT eyes are anicteric.  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Mucous membranes are moist.  There are some pustules
on the hard palette.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy.
 Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.
No murmurs or thrills noted.  Chest decreased breath sounds
at the bases bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.  Neurologically, cranial
nerves II through XII.  Alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 5.2,
hematocrit 24.6, platelets 250, sodium 140, potassium 4.2,
chloride 104, bicarb 23, BUN 70, creatinine 2.4, glucose 353,
albumin 3, calcium 8.7, magnesium 2, PT 424.7, PTT 68.5, INR
4.  Microbiology tests revealed Legionella and microplasm
were negative.  Urine culture on [**12-19**] is negative.  Blood
culture on [**12-19**] is pending.  Throat culture shows no strep
or gram C.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  In regard to the
patient's diastolic congestive heart failure she was
continued on her treatment with beta blockers.  As far as her
coronary artery disease the patient was continued on
secondary prevention with aspirin, beta blocker and a statin.
Her blood pressure was well controlled in the 130s with
Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d.  The patient did have an episode of
feeling lightheaded with decreased blood pressures so her
Cozaar and Hydrochlorothiazide were never restarted.

2.  Infectious disease:  The patient finished her seven day
course of Doxycycline for possible Ehrlichiosis.  As for her
community and Nasochromial pneumonia, the patient was
initially continued on the regimen of Vancomycin, Zosyn, and
Flagyl.  By day of discharge her Vancomycin and Flagyl were
discontinued.  It was felt that a two week course of Levaquin
at 250 mg po q day and Augmentin 500 mg po b.i.d. would be
enough to cover the pneumonia.  Mycoplasma serum antibodies
were checked and are pending.  Attempts were made to do
obtain a nasopharyngeal wash collection for viruses.
However, given the fact that the patient recently had some
nasal pluggings removed by ENT that was initially placed for
a nose bleed, we were unable to obtain the nasopharyngeal
washings.  The patient did have diarrhea one day prior to
discharge, so Clostridium difficile ASA was sent.  The
Clostridium difficile was negative.

3.  Renal:  The patient does have chronic renal insufficiency
secondary to diabetes mellitus with a creatinine baseline at
2.1.  Her creatinine during the hospital resumed back to
baseline at 2 to 2.1.

4.  Hematology:  On transfer to the medical flor the patient
was found to be anemic, so she was given 2 units of packed
red blood cells.  Her epoetin shots were restarted.
Hematocrit was followed on a daily basis.  Iron studies were
sent, but are still pending upon discharge.

5.  Endocrine:  For management of the diabetes mellitus, the
patient was continued on only half of her normal regimen
given the fact that her po intake was not at her normal
level.  She was managed on Glargine 36 units at night and NPH
13 units in the morning, being covered by a Humalog sliding
scale.  The patient did have an event of hyperglycemia for
refusal of taking her NPH dose in the morning.  Her [**Last Name (un) **]
doctors did [**Name5 (PTitle) **] by to consult and recommended that the
patient should be taking the NPH despite the fact that the
sugars may be within reasonable levels in the morning.

6.  Rheumatology:  The patient had a rash that may be
associated with her scleroderma.  She was encouraged to
follow up with her rheumatologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as needed.
