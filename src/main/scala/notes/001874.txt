and eating normally. This morning, she had decreased O2 sats and
change in mental status with decreased attetivnss and ability to

.

She was treated with linezolid for MRSA and p aruginosa PNA.
FInichsed course on [**2-1**].

Otherwise, she does not follow commands

arrest and was severely hypercarbic. Pulm: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
NWH
2. ?tracheomalacia + tracheal stenosis - bronch at NWH on [**1-6**]
demonstrated dynamic exp collapse of the trachea extending to
tbe mainstem bronchi and stenosis above the stomal trach
involving the croicoid
3. DMII
4. hypothyroidism
5. HTN
6. OA
7. OSA
8. hypoventaliation syndrome
9. Depression

CXR:  Limited study due to patient rotation, with:
1. No evidence of heart failure or definite pneumonia
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Increased bibasilar opacities suggestive of
atelectasis/aspiration.

Elbox Xray:
IMPRESSION:  Left elbow joint effusion with malalignment of the
medial humeral condyle is suggestive of underlying fracture.  CT
of the elbow is recommended for further characterization.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Only two views are provided,
both of which are obliquely positioned. Allowing for this, there
is no evidence of joint
effusion, the alignment is normal and there is no fracture. A CT
of the elbow has already been arranged.

CT elbow: Limited study due to patient motion and habitus;
allowing for
this, there appears to be normal alignment without definite
fracture or joint effusion.

CT Head:
There are no comparisons on record.  There is no intra- or
extra-
axial hemorrhage, the midline structures are in the midline and
the ventricles and cisterns are normal in size and in contour.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is, overall, maintained,
with no focal sulcal effacement or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation to indicate acute vascular territorial
infarction.  There are scattered and somewhat ill-defined low-
attenuation foci in both cerebral hemispheres, particularly
evident in the left frontal subcortical, bilateral
subinsular/external capsule and left periatrial regions, likely
representing a combination of chronic microvascular and lacunar
infarction.  There is no evidence of significant soft tissue
injury and no underlying skull fracture is seen.  The middle ear
cavities and included portions of the paranasal sinuses are
largely clear; the mastoid processes, bilaterally, appear
sclerotic and may be congenitally non- pneumatized.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial abnormality.
2.  Evidence of chronic microvascular and lacunar infarction, as
described.

CT Spine: No fracture.  Marked degenerative changes involving
the cervical
spine notably grade I anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 with focal
angular kyphosis.  There is also moderate canal narrowing
secondary to exuberant posterior  endplate osteophytes at C5-C6.


EKG:
Sinus rhythm
Atrial premature complex
First degree A-V delay
Left atrial abnormality
Left bundle branch block
No previous tracing available for comparison
