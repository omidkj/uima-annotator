Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line insertion

History of Present Illness:
66 yo F with PMH of morbid obesity, PAF, DM2, COPD on 2L home
oxygen, CAD and recent diagnosis of PE who presents from OSH
with SOB and fevers. She was taken from rehab to [**Hospital3 **]
hospital with SOB and fever to 100. She was recently at [**Hospital1 18**] in
the beginning of [**Month (only) **] with SOB. It was thought that she likely
had PE. Given her shellfish allergy, she had a VQ scan rather
than a CTA. This returned indeterminant and the decision was
made to treat her with coumadin for presumed PE. She also had a
cellulitis on her pannus and was sent to rehab on vancomycin and
ceftazidine which ended on [**2174-10-13**].
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were T 101.8, HR 94, BP 166/30, RR
28, O2sat 95% 3L NC. She was noted to have a subtherapeutic [**Date Range 263**]
of 1.8 and she was started on a heparin gtt. She also complained
to RUQ pain and had an ultrasound which was negative. A CXR was
also negative. A U/A was positive and it was thought she had a
UTI from a foley catheter. She was admitted to CC7 for further
work up. On admission there, she was in no acute distress. She
noted her SOB was improved but was still having fevers. She was
given vancomycin and ceftriaxone for UTI antibiotics and the
plan was to likely send her home in the AM.
.
A trigger was called shortly after admission for hypoxia and
tachypnea. She was found to have blue lips and SOB. She also
felt chest pain that was across her entire chest wall and around
to her back. She had an EKG which was unchanged, given
nitroglycerin which did not change her pain. She was also given
nebulizers for wheezing, and given lasix but did not put out
much to it. Another CXR was performed which was largely
unchanged. She had an ABG which was 7.26/65/339 on NRB. She was
changed to a 35% face mask. She was transferred to the ICU for
further care.
.
Currently, she feels her breathing is slightly improved but
still not at baseline. She still has some chest pain as well.
+nausea. No vomiting. No abdominal pain currently. +fevers. No
chills. Can not assess dysuria given foley in place. No
diarrhea.
