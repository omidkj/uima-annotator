Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
L MCA stroke (transfer)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation and subsequent extubation
Left decompressive hemicraniectomy
Tracheostomy and subsequent removal
Percutaneous gastrostomy placement
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 62yo [**Country 13622**] woman with a history of hysterectomy,
frequent prior syncopal episodes versus falls (?), and no prior
vascular risk factors who is transferred from [**Hospital 487**] Hospital
for the management of a left MCA stroke.
The history is obtained from the patient's family (as the
patient is intubated without sedation at this time), as well as
paper transcripts of outside hospital reports.

[**Known firstname 110474**] is originally from the [**Country 13622**] Republic and visits
her family in [**Location (un) 86**] intermittently. Her health has recently
been well, although her daughters noted that she had perhaps had
a 20 pound weight loss over the past
year or so, and it's not clear whether this is intentional. Over
the past five days, she had been complaining of left sided neck
pain, and further detials are not available. Of note, the
patient has previously complained of intermitted left arm and
leg numbness that is paroxysmal and that has been worked up
without a clear diagnosis. On [**3-14**], she was doing well, out
and about with her daughters, walking and talking without
difficulty. On
the morning of [**2192-3-15**], she woke up at about 750AM to go
to the bathroom. It's not exactly clear what happened then, but
the daughters report that she walked to the bathroom but
stumbled
backwards. She somehow managed to walk back to the bed and lay
back
on the bed with a thump which woke her husband up. [**Name2 (NI) **] noticed
that she was not able to talk or understand what he was saying
to
her. She was not moving her extremities on either side, and he
did not notice if her eyes deviated one way or the other. EMS
was called and
she was transported emergently to the ED. While in the ED, she
was noted to be vomitting/drooling (?) and with "level of
consciousness diminished. She was intubated for airway
protection. On [**3-15**] history and physical examination, the
patient was noted to be hyporeflexic on the left, symmetric
upper extremity reflexes, and no other abnormal cranial nerve
signs. A NCHCT was done which was normal save for an old right
cerebellar
hypodensity. She was then admitted to the CCU. This was the
assessment and plan at that time:

- "Change in loss of consciousness with possible CVA. The
patient
is on a vent for airway protection. We will rule out exogenous
causes such as myocardial infarction with EKG and enzymes.
Repeat
neuro checks and CT for the head showed no bleed. Aspirin was
given in the emergency room. We will discuss further meds with
neurology."

Her troponins remained stably negative. The following day,
apparently there was a change in her neurologic examination for
which a CT scan was done which showed a large left superior
division MCA stroke with 5mm of midline shift. A dense MCA sign
was noted. She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] per patient's
family's request for a higher level of care.

Laboratory analysis performed at this OSH has shown no
significant abnormality including A1c, lipids, TFTs, TOX panels,
etc.

She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and admitted to the
neuro ICU for further management.

Past Medical History:
- No history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia or smoking
- Hysterectomy
- Tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy
- Very unclear and unsure history of a previous bleed (?)
requiring angiographic intervention, but then later confirmed to
be not an intracranial bleed. Experienced outside the US.
- Frequent falls: this was denied by one of the daughters, but
has been mentioned in the outside hospital initial note


Social History:
She lives in the DR [**Last Name (STitle) 151**] her husband. [**Name (NI) **] of a
large family with six children. No history of smoking, drinking
or illicit substance use.


Family History:
Mother with history of "brain tumor", half
brother with stroke in the past. Daughters are healthy.


Physical Exam:
ADMISSION EXAM
Physical Exam:
Vitals: AF, 121/62, 59 (regular), 100%, 14
General: Intubated without sedation, eyes closed, no apparent
distress.
HEENT: NC/AT, no conjunctival icterus noted, MMM, no lesions
noted in
oropharynx
Neck: Supple, no masses or lymphadenopathy
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W
Cardiac: Slow but regular, nl. S1S2, no M/R/G noted
Abdomen: Obese, soft, NT/ND, no masses or organomegaly noted, no
bowel sounds auscultated.
Extremities:warm and well perfused
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:
- Eyes are closed. She does not respond to her family or myself
calling her name. She does grimace to painful supraorbital
stimulation and on sternal rub, she will localize with her left
arm.
- Both pupils are 5mm and reactive. Eyes are conjugate and in
midposition with positive VORs. There is a gag/cough. Corneal
reflex is difficult to assess. She initiates her own breaths.
- Right arm is without spontaneous movements. Tone is increased
in the right arm with maintained reflexes. It does withdraw to
noxious stimulation
- Right leg is without spontaneous movements. Tone is
symmetrically increased with dropped reflexes. It does
withdraw/flex to pain.
- Left arm and leg do have some spontaneous movements and
localize. Reflexes are present and normal in both upper and
lower
extremity. Tone is normal.
