URINE CULTURE (Final [**2188-1-11**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml

CTA:
1) No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.
2) Multiple right hilar, and subcarinal calcified lymph nodes
consistent with prior granulomatous infection.
3) 5 mm right middle lobe calcified nodule consistent with prior
granulomatous infection. Additionally, two smaller non-specific
nodules as described above.
4) Diffuse atherosclerotic disease.

CXR: The heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal
limits. Sternal suture wires and mediastinal clips consistent
with prior CABG. The pulmonary vasculature appears unremarkable.
At the left base, an area of apparent increased opacity likely
relates to superimposition of vascular and osseous structures at
the crossing of two ribs. No pleural effusion and no
pneumothorax. The osseous structures appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61356**] is a 54 year old man s/p CABG, who presented with a
COPD flare. He was initially started on azithromycin x 5 days
and a prednisone taper. He was also started on albuterol,
ipratropium nebulizers. He was also found to be positive for
influenza A by nasal aspirate. On his second hospital day, Mr.
[**Known lastname 61356**] had an acute decompensation and was found to be in
respiratory distress. His ABG showed 7.29/53/100 despite
numerous nebulizers. He was transferred to the MICU and
intubated. He was stabilized, started on Tamiflu, and
successfully extubated 3 days later. He was found to be growing
4+ gram positive cocci in his sputum and started a course of
levofloxacin prior to discharge.

In terms of Mr. [**Known lastname 61357**] CAD, he remained stable. He was continued
on ASA, Lipitor, and BB. His ACE I was held initially given mild
acute renal failure. The ACE was restarted at discharge.

Regarding the acute renal failure, this was thought to be a
combination of intravascular depletion (prerenal) and contrast
induced from the CTA obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism.

Mr. [**Known lastname 61356**] was vaccinated against the flu and pneumococcal
pneumonia. He was discharged to a local hotel in excellent
condition and with his sister's company. He had been counselled
to quit smoking and take rests on his car trip home to [**State 4260**].
