Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation on [**2118-8-30**] for increased PCO2 and somnolence
Extubation on [**2118-8-31**]


History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 51 y.o. Spanish-speaking female with COPD, OSA,
diabetes insipidus, ?Down's Syndrome, hypothyroid,
?pan-hypopituitary, who presented to ED with dyspnea, fever
headache and abdominal pain and was later admitted to the MICU
for hypotension. On presentation to the ER, she was febrile
101.5, HR 76, BP 99/59, RR 16, 95% RA. She desaturated with ABG
7/32/78/46 and was placed on 31% ventimask. She received
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin and 4mg of Dexamethasone. She then
became hypotensive (BP 60/30), received 2L NS with improvement
(BP 96/50), but was transferred to the MICU.

While in the unit, her BP improved with fluids and dexamethasone
and remained stable. It was thought that the hypotension was due
to adrenal insufficiency as well as her DI in the absence of her
DDAVP since she her hourly urine output was >300cc/hour during
her transfer from the ED to the unit. Her hyponatremia and ARF
resolved and because of her sleep apnea, she was started on
BIPAP at night with weaning during the day. She was maintained
on Albuterol/Atrovent for COPD. Her initial complaint of LUQ
pain was worked up with an abdominal CT which showed a right
adnexal mass with a fluid attenuation mass inferiorly and
cardiomegaly with a right-sided predominance. A pelvic US and
echo were both suggested. Pt. was also found to be
thrombocytopenic, which is her baseline, etiology unknown. On
[**2118-8-30**], she was intubated because of increased PCO2, somnolence
and concerns for airway protection, but she has known sleep
apnea and was extubated successfully on [**2118-8-31**] and trasferred to
the floor.

5) Pulmonary artery hypertension: attributed to COPD/OSA
6) ASD with shunt: shunt study demonstrated R-> L shungt with
12% shunt fraction (precluding meaningful repair)
7) Central diabetes insipidis
- ? pan- hypo pit: on prednisone 5 mg daily, levothyroxine,
desmopressin
8) Down Syndrome

Brief Hospital Course:
51F Spanish speaking h/o COPD, OSA, diabetes insipidus, ? Down's
syndrome, hypothyroid, ?pan-hypopituitary xferred to the MICU
after being admitted for abdominal pain, then developed
hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure, now resolved.
Patient's blood pressure stabilized in the MICU and was thought
to be due to adrenal insufficiency. While in the MICU, patient
went into hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear etiology
(apnea?) and was intubated, but successfully extubated the next
day and transferred to the floor. The following issues were
investigated during her admission:
.
# Hypoxia - The differential in the MICU included angioedema [**3-3**]
Lisinopril use vs.
hypercarbic respiratory failure from underlying COPD exacerbated
by insufficient corticoster
