ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  The patient is a 73 year-old
woman who was in her usual state of health until about
[**2176-12-11**] when she started noticing increasing swelling
in her extremities and also some edema in her face and some
dyspnea.  She was initially treated with diuretics and
subsequently underwent a cardiac evaluation, which was
notable for elevated pulmonary artery pressures and possible
right heart failure.  Further workup of this noted elevated
pulmonary artery pressures and imaging showed that she had a
right upper lobe lung mass.  As per the patient she had a
negative bronchoscopy and a mediastinoscopy in the past, but
fine needle aspiration of this mass was positive for
malignancy.  Given the nature of her lesion it was determined
that the patient would benefit from right upper lobectomy.
At the time of admission the patient was alert and oriented.
Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements intact.  There was no lymphadenopathy in the neck
nor was there a bruit.  She had a well healed mediastinoscopy
incision.  Her chest was clear with good breath sounds
bilaterally.  Her heart was regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender without any ascites.  Extremities were
warm.  Dorsalis pedis pulses are 2+.  As per prior note she
had minimal pitting edema in the lower extremities.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  Hemoglobin was 8.9 with platelet
count of 270.  Her BUN and creatinine at the time admission
were 59 and 1.9 respectively with a potassium of 5.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2177-6-30**].
She underwent preoperative placement of a pulmonary artery
catheter to monitor pulmonary artery pressures.  She was
taken to the Operating Room on [**2177-7-1**] where she
underwent an exploratory thoracotomy with multiple lymph node
biopsies and biopsy of right diaphragmatic plaque.
Intraoperatively it was found that the patient had extensive
nodal involvement and it was determined that a lobectomy
should not be undertaken and the patient was taken to the
post anesthesia care unit.  In the post anesthesia care unit
she developed some respiratory difficulties and required
reintubation and also required vaso active pressors and
fluids to improve her low blood pressure and heart rate.
Nitroglycerin was used for elevated pulmonary artery
pressures.  On postoperative day one the patient remained
intubated and was noted to have a significant rise in
creatinine at 2.7.  Nephrology was consulted and determined
that this was acute renal failure superimposed upon a history
of chronic renal problem and advised gentle diuresis and
avoidance of agents that induce renal vaso constriction.
Neurology was also consulted for mental status changes.  The
patient had undergone an examination and was nonfocal and had
no further recommendations or indications of acute
neurological pathology appearing at that time.  The patient
was weaned to extubation on the course of postoperative day
two and on postoperative day three was placed on CPAP.  By
postoperative day four the patient had weaned off all drips
and had been extubated and was doing well and was therefore
transferred to the floor.

During her period on Far 2 she experienced some confusion as
a result of her narcotics, which were subsequently stopped,
but otherwise her course was unremarkable.  She continued
aggressive incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet with
ambulation and her respiratory examination improved and she
was able to maintain good O2 sats on room air.  On
postoperative day six the patient was weaned down from her O2
and given the ability to ambulate and her respiratory
condition she was discharged to home and asked to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in three days at his clinic.  She was also
told to follow up with her primary care physician in one
week.  To note laboratories at the time of discharge showed a
hematocrit of 29.9 with a BUN and creatinine of 46 and 1.6
respectively with a potassium of 4.1.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg po q day.
2.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
4.  Atenolol 50 mg po q.d.
5.  Spironolactone 25 mg po q.d.
6.  Furosemide 40 mg po q.d.
7.  Potassium chloride 20 milliequivalents po q.d.

She was advised to seek immediate medical attention if she
experiences onset of shortness of breath or chest pain.
