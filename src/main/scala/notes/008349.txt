Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2202-11-25**] Esophagogastroduodenoscopy

History of Present Illness:
57 y/o female s/p redo-sternotomy, mitral valve replacement and
tricuspid valve repair, with prior admission for GI bleed and
hematocrit of 13 with elevated INR from [**11-4**] to [**11-16**] who
presented to ED with lightheadedness and a hematocrit of 12 and
INR 5.1.
.
Recent admission [**11-4**] for hct of 13 admitted with hct 12 on
[**11-28**]. Last admission she had guaiac + stool in the setting of
high INR and she underwent an EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] which was relatively
unrevealing for a source of GI bleeding. She was discharged home
in a stable condition after receiving PRBC and FFP with no signs
of continous bleed. Last admission, she underwent a TTE to
assess for integrity of the artificial valve site and revealed
trivial paravalvular mitral leak with a normally functioning
mitral valve and aortic bioprosthesis and tricuspid ring.

Past Medical History:
Mitral regurgitation and Tricuspid Regurgitation s/p
Redo-Sternotomy w/ Mitral Valve Replacement and Tricuspid Valve
Repair [**2202-10-11**], s/p Aortic Valve Replacement, Systemic Lupus
erythematosis, Hypertension, Pulmonary Hypertension, Raynaud's
disease, s/p cholecystectomy, Lupus nephritis, Rheumatic heart
disease, Portal hypertension, Anemia

Social History:
Patient is married with one son, denies tobacco, minimal EtOH.

Family History:
Grandmother died from a CVA at age 50. Father died at age 70
from complications of diabetes.

Physical Exam:
Gen: No acute distress, pale
Heart: Regular, rate and rhythm with + mechanical valve click
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
Abd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended
Ext: Warm, well-perfused -edema
Skin: Sternal wound clean/dry/intact and well-healed

Pertinent Results:
[**11-25**] Echo: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A
bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is
present. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2202-11-4**], the findings
are similar.
[**11-24**] CXR: The patient is status post sternotomy and aortic and
mitral valve replacement. The heart is enlarged. The lungs are
clear.
============================
EGD: Normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI Ms. [**Known lastname 9996**] presented to the ED with
lightheadedness with HCT of 12 and INR of 5.1. She was admitted
to the CVICU and transfused 4 units of PRBC's and 2 units of
FFP. She again had a GI work-up which included a EGD. EGD
revealed no sources of bleeding and she then underwent a capsule
study. Again on hospital day two she received an additional 2
units of blood. Hematocrit on the following day was 28.
===========================================
Pt was subsequently transferred to the medicine service for
further work-up of her anemia and atrial flutter:

1. Anemia: This is the pt's second admission for a markedly low
Hct. Haptoglobin added to admission labs was 20 suggesting
hemolysis, but LDH and bili should have been elevated if
hemolysis was cause of Hct drop to 13.  Pt states that stools
are chronically dark as a consequence of iron supplementation,
but that her stool leading up to this hospitalization was
somewhat darker than usual.  Given labs atypical for hemolysis,
GI bleed was felt to be more likely cause of her anemia.  No
bleeding sources were found on two EGD's and a colonoscopy,
promptimg a capsule endoscopy which showed a non-bleeding ulcer.
 Pt hematocrit stabilized and was at 26.7 at the time of
discharge.

2. Atrial flutter: Pt successfully cardioverted and in sinus
rhythm, flipped back into atrial flutter the day of discharge,
EP was made aware and did not wish for any additional
cardioversions.  Pt. was given an extra dose of metoprolol and
discharged on metoprolol XL 75 QD, with her rate in the 80's.

3. S/p AVR/MVR: Pt's INR target is [**2-7**]. This needs to be very
closely followed as outpt given significant bleeds occuring when
slightly supratherapeutic and significant risk of thrombus
formation with mechanical mitral valve if subtherapeutic.  Pt.
will follow up in [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 263**] clinic and have cardiology NP at
[**Hospital1 **] follow it up ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).  Pt. was discharged when INR
was 2.1 so there was no need for Lovenox as per CT surgery.

4. Lupus: Pt states that she developed joint pain last time she
discontinued hydroxychloroquine. It was continued during this
admission.

Discharge Condition:

medically stable for discharge.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with anemia thought due to a gastrointestinal
bleed.  The source of the bleeding remains unclear, however, you
had a capsule endoscopy during admission, the results of which
are pending.  Your INR was supratherapeutic on admission, and
your goal INR was changed to 2.5-3.0.  You should follow-up with
the anticoagulation nurses on Friday at the [**Hospital **] clinic in
the same way you had done previously.

During admission you developed an irregular heart rhythm called
atrial flutter.  You were cardioverted with reversion of your
heart rhythm back to normal sinus rhythm.  However, you reverted
back to atrial flutter/fibrillation, so we increased your dosage
of
