CXR [**3-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Placement of left subclavian central venous catheter
terminating in the left jugular vein. Repositioning needed. This
has been flagged to the ED dashboard.
2. Near complete opacification of the left hemithorax, which
could represent pneumonia and/or effusion.

CXR [**3-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post replacement of an endotracheal tube with a
tracheostomy tube in satisfactory location.
2. Better aeration left main bronchus, but persistent left
atelectasis.

CXR [**3-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent left upper and lower lobe pneumonia.

CXR [**3-28**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the normally ventilated
apical areas in the left lung have further decreased. Otherwise,
the radiographic appearance is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 37 yo male with spina bifida, h/o hypercarbic resp failure
on chronic vent support, h/o recurrent UTIs, a/w sepsis
(hypotension, fever, LLL infiltrate, positive UA)

#. Sepsis: Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] tachycardic,
initially hypotensive responding to IVFs, and leukocytosis with
positive UA and CXR c/w pneumonia.  He was initially started on
vanco/cefepime in the ICU.  His blood cultures remained
negative, but his urine grew resistant E.coli which was
sensitive to cefepime.  The sputum grew P. aureginosa which was
also found to be sensitive to cefepime.  His fever curve
improved, his WBC improved, and he was hemodynamically stable.
He did not require any changes to his home ventilator settings
except for a slight decrease in TV to prevent barotrauma to his
right lung that did not have evidence of PNA.  He had diarrhea,
but was found to have negative C.diff.  He also had a large
sacral stage IV decubitus ulcer which was evaluated by wound
care.  The patient does not like frequent turning, but nursing
tried to maintain the area clean.  His hypotension resolved with
IVFs.  He had a left subclavian placed initially which was then
removed and a Left IJ was placed.  He also had a midline placed
prior to coming to [**Hospital1 18**].  He will be treated for a full 2 week
course of cefepime (started [**3-22**]) to cover for complicated UTI
and Hospital/Ventilator associated pneumonia.

#. Acute Kidney Injury: creatinine up to 1.9 from 0.7 on [**3-21**];
this was most likely in the setting of hypotension/sepsis in the
setting of infection.  With IVFs his creatinine improved back to
his baseline of <1.0.  His furosemide was held initially but
then restarted at home dose prior to discharge.

#. Chroni
