cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47097**] is an 82 year old woman with in stent thrombosis s/p
cath on [**3-20**] and [**3-22**]. She did not take her plavix on the
morning of the admission. She was brought to the cath lab for
angiojet and POBA. Her EKG reveals Q waves in V1-V4 and ST
elevations in V1-V4. An intraortic balloon pump and a PA
catheter for further support and monitoring were placed as she
was in cardiogenic shock.

? h/o TIA
arthritis

Retired secretary in army-worked as a switch board operator. Now
does a lot of arts and crafts at home. Lives alone in an
apartment in senior living apartment complex. Manages her own
meds and finances. IADLs. Stopped smoking 60 years ago. No
alcohol or illicits. Has three children- one daughter [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 60871**] lives closest in [**Location (un) 15749**].

Family History:
Father died of an MI @ age 54
Mother died of cancer at 88 years old.
No CAD in brothers or sisters.


Physical Exam:
VS: afebrile    156/64   93   100% RA
Gen: very pleasant elderly female, NAD
HEENT: PERRL, OP clear
Neck: difficult to assess JVD
Lungs: coarse BS/rhonchorous BS bilaterally
CV: RRR, nl s1/s2, no m/r/g
Abd: obese, nt/nd, nabs, no masses
Extr: no c/c/e, PT 2+ bilaterally
Groin: with IABP, right groin

Pertinent Results:
Echo Conclusions:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
with akinesis of the anterior and anteroseptal, distal inferior,
and apical walls. The anterolateral wall is hypokinetic but
moves best. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle. The
aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

ECG: Compared with the prior study (tape reveiwed) of [**2130-3-23**],
the extensive left ventricular wall motion and right ventricular
apical abnormalities are new and c/w interim infarction/ischemia
(distal anterior septum and distal anterior wall hypokinesis
were present on review of the prior study). Sinus rhythm with
PVCs Possible acute anterolateral myocardial infarction

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Cardiovascular: Ms. [**Known lastname 47097**] is 82 year old with in stent
thrombosis. She required a balloon pump and milrinone for her
cardiogenic shock. After 3 days, the balloon pump was
successfully weaned. Her milrinone was weaned two days later,
after she developed NSVT. She was continued on aspirin, and her
plavix was increased to 150 mg per day. Once she was stable, she
was started on and ACE inhibitor and beta blockade which were
titrated up as her blood pressure allowed.  She was also started
on a Lasix and Spironolactone prior to discharge for management
of her CHF.

Ms. [**Known lastname 47097**] had a surface echocardiogram which showed an EF of
25% and an akinetic apex. For her akinetic ventricle,
anticoagulation was considered, but it was decided that she was
too much of a fall risk. She was also seen by the
electrophysiology service for question of placement of ICD. It
was felt that her EF should be evaluated with surface echo in
[**4-12**] weeks. If it is still low at that time, she should be
considered for ICD placement.

Ms. [**Known lastname 47097**] remained in sinus rhythm except for a few hours when
she developed NSVT while on milrinone. She initially required a
nonrebreather, but as her shock improved, the oxygen was weaned.
She was on a 7 day course of levofloxacin when she spiked a
fever and developed what appeared to be a pneumonia on chest x
ray. Once she was stable, she was seen by the physical therapy
team.

Her telemetry prior to discharge showed a 3 second pause
(asymmetric, while sleeping); this was thought to be vagal
response vs. evidence of conduction problem. As per
electrophysiology, she was discharged on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hears Monitor
for 1 week, and she will follow up with EP as above in 4 weeks.

2.  Leukocytosis: She had a leukocytosis while in-house of
unclear [**Name2 (NI) 60874**] (WBC 14-16).  She was afebrile, without signs of
infection, and had negative urine, stool cultures and a negative
CXR.  This should be worked up as an outpatient.

3.  Headaches.  She had severe migraines while in-house.  She
was seen by neurology who recommended continuing Percocet and
Butalbital as needed (triptans contraindicated given heart
disease).

4.  Disposition: She was discharged to follow up with a TTE/EP
evaluation in 1 month.  She will have her creatinine/potassium
checked a few days after discharge (she was not discharged on
potassium supplementation even with Lasix, for she did not
require much potassium supplementation on this regimen
in-house).  She will follow up with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], who
should arrange for outpatient cardiology follow up as well.
