Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2499**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old female with a history of stage
IIIA NSCLC s/p lobectomy, radiation, chemotherapy [**10-20**] and
remote history of breast cancer as well as worsening chronic SOB
who presented to outpatient hem/onc clinic on [**2-24**] with worsening
SOB.
.
Since [**2134-6-17**] she has had progressive dyspnea and has seen Dr.

[**Doctor Last Name 2168**] to w/u this process (per husband, breathing has not
been the same since lobectomy). And has had a bronch [**8-/2134**]
negative for malignancy; + atypical cells suggestive of post-XRT
change however; Cx + for MAC (grew out after 1 month). She has
not undergone any therapy for this. She developed SOB and
pleuritic chest pain in middle of [**Month (only) 1096**] and was admitted from
[**Date range (1) 104003**] and found to have a large pericardial effusion which
required emergent pericardiocentesis.  Cytology did not show
malignant cells and stains for AFB, viral, fungal, bacterial,
gram stain were all negative (2+ PMNs).  Her SOB greatly
improved and she was treated with azithro and cefpodoxime for
RUL opacities on admission CT and history of MAC (dx [**2134**], never
treated, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] as outpt) for a total of 7
days, as well as oxygen and nebs at home.  Since the patient was
discharged from the hospital she has been SOB at rest with very
limited ambulation and on O2 at all times.  2 weeks ago went to
OSH ED with SOB and was diagnosed with pericarditis, unclear
treatment.  1 week prior to admission patient was more somnolent
and taking ativan regularly in an attempt to treat worsening
SOB.  She went to [**Hospital3 **] ED two days PTA where she was found
to be 84% on ambulation.  CXR was done which showed RML opacity
and bilateral effusions. She was discharged home on doxycylcine
but represented to [**Hospital1 18**] for second opinion.  She was seen in
clinic and d/t respiratory distress was had CT of chest which
showed new PNA in RUL and increasing bilateral effusions.  She
initially came to the floor and ABG demonstrated chronic
respiratory acidosis with compensation.  Serial ABG's showed
worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia, she become more somnolent,
and was transferred to MICU.

CT [**2135-2-24**]:
IMPRESSION:  New pneumonia in the upper lobes. Mild increase
mediastinal node size, probably reactive. Decreased pericardial
effusion.  Stable radiation fibrosis in the right middle lobe
and anterior segment of left upper lobe. Unchanged left lung
apical tuberculous scar. Increased left nonhemorrhagic pleural
effusion.
Coronary calcifications.
.
[**2135-2-25**] ECHO:
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated. LV wall thickness [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] [**First Name3 (LF) **] (>55%).  RN
[**First Name3 (LF) **].  RV free wall hypertrophied.  Trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) 650**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] HTN.
There is a
small partially echodense pericardial effusion.  Unchanged ECHO
from prior on [**1-20**].
.
[**2135-2-27**] CXR:
Again noted is right-sided volume loss with associated increased
opacity involving the right lung pulmonary parenchyma,
unchanged.  Bilateral pleural effusions persist.  No
pneumothorax detected.  Bibasilar atelectasis is present.  No
interval change. Calcified granuloma is again noted in the left
lung apex.  Left perihilar
opacity remains similar in appearance.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted to the OMED service from clinic for further
work-up and care. On presentation, the pt was extremely
somnolent and was noted to be sating in the low 90s on 4L NC. An
ABG was significant for a significant respiratory acidosis with
compensatory metabolic alkalosis that appeared to be more
chronic in nature. Given the history of the pt taking Ativan
everytime she felt short of breath since her prior admission,
this was thought to be the primary cause of her respiratory
acidosis, especially as the pt was not tachypneic on physical
exam. She was placed on IV vancomycin, cefepime, and
azithromycin to broadly cover for a nosocomial PNA that was
visualized on CXR and CT on admission. She was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] overnight on hospital day 1 given concern for
increasing somnolence and PCO2. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], ativan was held and
the pt's mental status improved back to baseline. She also
underwent a L thoracocentesis that was not significant for an
empyema and cytology was negative for malignant cells. Her O2
requirement was weaned from 6L to 4 L and she was then
transferred back to the floor where she completed a 10 day
course of IV vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. She was
also placed on standing nebs and started on an ipratropium
inhaler. It was thought that the pt's SOB on presentation was
likely multi-factorial including chronic issues of radiation
changes, lobectomy, restrictive disease on PFTs, and possibly
cancer.  More acute worse
