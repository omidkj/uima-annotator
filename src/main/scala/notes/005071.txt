Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Endoscopy
- Cystoscopy
- Bilateral lower extremity angiography


History of Present Illness:
85 year-old man with a remote history of CVA minimally verbal
with residual right-sided defects who presents with dyspnea and
increasing falls.  Per his family he is generally unsteady on
his feet but has been falling more recently.  He fell several
times at home today, hitting his forehead and nose.  This
morning, following the falls, he was not talking at all (usually
communicates one word sentences and can yell for help).  His
family called EMS.  Per their report, he has been complaining of
foot pain, but denied shortness of breath or chest pain.  When
EMS found him, he was in respiratory distress, with a low
saturation (number no[**Serial Number 12047**]) on room air.

Per his primary NP, he speaks in one word sentences at baseline.
 He recently has been seen for difficulty walking, possilby
related to plantar fascitis and in the past two days has been
looking somewhat pale.  On [**8-23**], he had a physical with labs:
Hb/Hct 10.1/30.6 with MCV 87.9, B12 deficieny.  BUN/Cr was
58/2.1

In the ED, initial VS were: 95.6 72 140/49 32 96 on NRB.  He was
tachypnic to 32, using accessory muscles.  An EKG was attempted,
but was limited due to motion.  It was reviewed with cardiology,
who recommended aspirin and blood given his elevated cardiac
enzymes.  He was treated with 600 mg PR aspirin.  He was also
noted to be in acute renal failure.  His chest x-ray was
suggestive of a RUL PNA.  He was treated with continuius nebs,
solumed 125, and mag 2g for h/o asthma.  He had blood cultures,
levoquin and flagyl for possible aspiration pneumonia.  Given
the right frontal head abrasion, he had a head/neck CT that was
negative for acute bleed or fracure.  Prior to transfer, VS: HR
92 BP 145/52 18 100% on continuous neb @ 12 L FM.  His
respiratory exam had improved from initially no air movement to
increasing wheezing.  He got kayexalate for an elevated K and
500 cc IVF.
.
Currently, he appears more comfortable.

STUDIES:
========
[**2129-1-8**] TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- and
distal septal segments, as well as of the apex and distal
inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
40%), most c/w multivessel CAD. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.1 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg)
due to mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate aortic stenosis. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2124-1-26**], new wall motion abnormalities are
seen. Severity of all valvular abnormalities has progressed.
Estimated pulmonary pressure is higher.

[**2129-1-8**] PORTABLE CXR:
SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Evaluation is somewhat limited by
patient
position and exclusion of the costophrenic angles bilaterally.
Within these limitations, and allowing for technique, the heart
size may be mildly enlarged. There are increased vascular
markings and hilar fullness suggestive of volume overload but
underlying infection is not excluded. The aorta is tortuous as
before.

IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the chest with probable
cardiomegaly and
pulmonary edema. Underlying infection not excluded.

[**2129-1-8**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage. No midline shift. Left frontal
encephalomalacia.
2. No depressed skull fracture.
3. Mild opacification of the mastoid, more prominent on the left
with no bony destruction. Correlate clinically. Mild ethmoidal
sinus mucosal thickening.

[**2129-1-8**] CT C-SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture of the cervical spine. Severe degenerative
changes
predispose this patient to spinal cord injury with minor trauma.
In the
appropriate clinical context, (for example myelopathy), consider
MR for
further characterization.
2. Right apical nodule versus apical scarring. Recommend
dedicated chest CT, which can be done as an outpatient.
3. Right pleural effusion.
4. Extensive degenerative changes at cranio-cervical junction.
