Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32090**] was transfered to the OMED service from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
after a one day stay which had required intubation.  Initially,
he required 4 LPM O2 via nasal cannula, and on arrival on the
floor, he experienced and episode of irregularly irregular
tachycardia, with rates b/t 100 and 150.  An EKG was ordered, an
interpreted as MFAT vs. ATACH with occasional PVC's.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 32090**] remained stable throughout this episode, and was
asymptomatic.  He was given 10 mg of Diltiazem, IVP, with
immediate rate control to the 70's.  He was followed with 30 of
Dilt PO, and then put on a regular schedule of 90 mg Dilt tid.
He was monitored on telemetry while on the floor.  He was
diuresed with Lasix IV 20 mg 1-2 doses/day, with occasional need
for K, Ca, and Mg repletion.  His SOB continued to improve
through this interval, with lessening O2 requirements, finally
needing only 2 lpm via NC.  On [**6-29**], after walking to the
bathroom without assistance, he was noted to have another
episode of atach with RVR with rates of approx 100-150.  He was
again asymptomatic and stable during this episode.  No Afib was
noted.  He was managed at this time with rest and an additional
po dose of Dilt, 30mg. Later in the day of the 29th, his rhythm
was stable, and he completed a video swallow study.  The
recommendations of the SLP were for no gulping, and sitting bolt
upright for any po.  He was d/c'd on the following day with F/U
in heme/onc clinic, home O2, and home PT.  His Dilt was
prescribed in ER form, at one 240 mg capsule qd.
