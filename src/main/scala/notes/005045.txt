Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
DKA/hyperglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right internal carotid central line

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13469**] is a 41yo F w/ h/o T2DM, depression and frequent past
admissions for DKA/hyperglycemia who presented to the ED w/ SOB,
tachycardia and tachypnea and found to have glucose 626. Pt
reports poyuria and polydypsia for past few days and often
skipping evening dose of insulin due to financial constraints
and stress/distractions at home. Pt woke this morning with
nausea and one episode of nonbloody nonbilious vomiting, rapid
heart rate and feeling of anxiety and rapid heart rate, similar
to prior episodes of hyperglycemia. She did not take her morning
insulin. Pt also endorses headache, blurry vision which she says
is at baseline due to cataracts and dabetic retinopathy, and
post-nasal drip due to allergies. She denies fever/chills,
productive cough, abdominal pain, change in bowels or sick
contacts. Pt has depression  treated with Paxel which she has
not taken for the past 2 wks after running out of the
medication, and reports sleeping more and feeling more depressed
lately. She denies current suicidal/homocidal ideals or thoughts
of self harm.

On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt's VS: T 98.7, HR 128, BP 111/55, RR 20,
Sa02 100% on 2L. Blood glucose 626. UA with glucose 1000 and
ketones 150. VBG showed pH 6.88, Bicarb 3, Anion gap 39. In the
[**Name (NI) **], pt was given a total of 5L NS, 10U insulin boluses x 2 and
started on insulin drop at 8U/hr and 2 mg lorazepam due to
anxiety and tachypnea/tachycardia.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 98.3 HR 91, BP 109/77,
RR 13, Sa02 96% on RA. IVF were switched to D51/2NS + 20mEq KCl
as BG 263. Due to inability to get PIV, central line placement
was required for blood draws and IVF administration.

CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Tip of the new right internal jugular line ends in the region of
the superior cavoatrial junction.  Lungs clear.  Heart size
normal.  No pneumothorax, pleural effusion or mediastinal
widening.


Brief Hospital Course:
41yo F w/ T2DM and frequent admissions for DKA/hyperglycemia
presenting with DKA and glucose >500 secondary to medication
non-compliance.

# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient presented with hyperglycemia,
anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonuria, likely secondary to
DKA in setting of insulin therapy non-adherence.  Patient had
mild leukocytosis, though no fevers/chills or localizing signs
or symptoms of infection.  UA not suggestive of UTI, and CXR
shows no acute process.  EKG similar to priors, and not
concerning for ischemia.  FSBS has improved on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
down from >600 to 315 and 260s on transfer to ICU.  Patient was
aggressively volume resuscitated with 5L NS in ED, and is
currently hemodynamically stable without evidence of significant
volume depletion. Glucose came down to wnl and gap closed.
Insulin drip was stopped.  [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes was consulted, who
recommended re-starting the patient's home regimen of insulin
70/30 25units qam, 20units pm. Urine culture was no growth to
date. Given an episode of mild hypoglycemia overnight the
patient regimen was adjusted to 70/30 27units QAM and 18 units
QPM. For 48hrs prior to discharge the patients blood sugars were
well controlled with the exception of one mild hypoglycemic
episode to the mid 60s. Prior to discharge the patient regimen
was:
- 70/30 27units QAM and 18 units QPM
- Humalog Sliding Scale QID with her QHS SS only receiving
humalog for PM FS of >250.

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis: This was secondary to DKA as
above, though lactate also elevated (in setting of DKA and
volume depletion).  Patient denies any ingestions. Had anion gap
initially of 39, which has resolved and currently anion gap of
9.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr elevated to 1.4 on admission, up from baseline of
0.5-0.7, now back to baseline at 0.7.  This was likely secondary
to pre-renal azotemia in setting of volume depletion from DKA.
Home lisinopril was been held given lower blood pressures,
volume depletion and risk of [**Last Name (un) **].

# Leukcytosis: Likely caused by stress response in setting of
DKA.  No localizing signs/symptoms of infection.  UA negative,
CXR negative, no fevers/chills.
On admission leukocytosis to 13.1 which has resolved to 7.5.

# HTN: Pt was restarted on ACEi while in house

# Depression: Pt has h/o psychiatric hospitalization in [**2150**] for
suicidal ideation. Pt denies SI, HI or thoughts of self harm
during current admission, although admits to feeling more
depressed and having her anxiety and fi
