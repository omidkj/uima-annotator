Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 year old woman with a history of Asthma,
CHF, admission from [**Date range (2) 97803**] for HCAP/VAP c/b intubation,
acute liver failure, and acute kidney failure requiring
hemodialysis now resolved with CKD with recent admission from
[**Date range (1) 79119**] for COPD exacerbation who presents from her [**Hospital 4382**] facility with shortness of breath.  Per report, the
patient was found to be short of breath by aides at the nursing
home.  EMS was called - they were unable to obtain access so
gave her 1 SL nitro as well as started her on CPAP and brought
her to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, initial VS were: 0 95.2 100 224/116 28 100%.  The
patient was difficult to obtain access on so a right femoral IJ
was placed as the patient was not able to lie flat.  She was
continued on CPAP, started on a nitro gtt, and given lasix 40mg
IV.  She put out ~500cc of urine to the lasix bolus.  Labs were
remarkable for a WBC of 17, Na of 129, Cr of 1.6.  Because of
the leukocytosis, the patient was given ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin for ?HCAP.  On transfer, vitals were: 98.5 79
154/75 20 100%.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient states her breathing is more
comfortable on the mask, although she does not like wearing it.
She states she missed a few of her doses as she had 27 medicines
to take and couldn't deal with all of them.  She also admits to
eating a couple saltier meals at home.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
============
Admitted to MICU for respiratory failure, type I in the setting
of significantly elevated BP (200s/100s) and a recent admission
for COPD exacerbation.  Given history of medication
noncompliance and pulmonary exam significant for crackles, acute
pulmonary edema was suspected.  Lack of fevers, productive
cough, aspiration event argued against pneumonia, and
antibiotics were discontinued after empirics were given in the
ED.  Initially started on nitro gtt and transitioned to home
hypertension medications (metoprolol, hydralazine, isosorbide)
with good response in blood pressures.  Was put on CPAP for
respiratory support and given 80mg of IV furosemide with 1.5 L
negative and improvement of her respiratory status.

Remained in sinus rhythm on this admission although patient has
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was noted to be in
a-fib during prior admisision.

Ms. [**Known lastname 20893**] is a 63 yof with CHF (EF >55%), asthma, and CKD (base
crea [**12-23**]) who was admitted to ICU for hypoxic respiratory
failure in setting of hypertensive emergency and pulmonary edema
