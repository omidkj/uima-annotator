Microbiology:

CXR ([**7-16**]) -
FINDINGS: The study is limited secondary to positioning. The
patient was
imaged in a lordotic and rotated orientation. Within those
limitations, the lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
The mediastinum is grossly stable. The cardiac silhouette is
within normal limits for size. No effusion or pneumothorax is
noted. Degenerative changes are noted throughout the mid and
lower thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Limited study with no definite acute pathology
identified.

KUB ([**7-19**]) -
INDICATION: Abdominal pain and hypoactive bowel sounds, concern
for ileus or obstruction.
TECHNIQUE: Portable supine and left lateral decubitus
radiographs of the
abdomen.
FINDINGS: Moderate amount of stool is seen in the large bowel
with an
otherwise unremarkable bowel gas pattern. There is no evidence
of
obstruction. There is no free intraperitoneal air seen. There is
no acute
fracture, or bony abnormality.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of ileus or obstruction. Moderate amount
of stool in the colon.

EKG ([**7-16**]) Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Possible biatrial
abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19376**] is a 76yo F with severe COPD
on 4 L home O2 admitted to the MICU with hypercarbic respiratory
failure.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient's hypercarbic
respiratory failure was thought to be due to a COPD exacerbation
 in the setting of medication non-compliance, resumption of
smoking. She was noted to be hypercarbic on admission on serial
ABGs. She is also likely a chronic retainer of CO2 given the
severity of her COPD and her chronically elevated bicarbonates,
and her serial ABGs demonstrating an underlying chronic
respiratory acidosis. She appeared clinically euvolemic on exam,
so acute heart failure exacerbation was less likely. Her sputum,
blood, and urine cultures showed no evidence of underlying
infection. She was admitted to the MICU, underwent intubation
and mechanical ventilation, received nebulizers with
ipratroprium and albuterol around the clock, IV steroids
(solumedrol). She also initially received Azithromycin and
Ceftriaxone for treatment of possible community acquired
pneumonia -- sputum returned without any growth so antibiotics
were tapered, and she completed 5 days of Azithromycin in the
hospital. She was eventually extubated to BiPAP. Her oxygen was
weanred to nasal cannula, with oxygen saturations between 88-95%
on [**3-3**] L NC. She occasionally desaturates down to 80% when
eating or beig turned, which returns to her baseline oxygen
saturations with repositioning and increased oxygen delivery.
She was weaned to prednisone and was discharged on an oral
prednisone taper. H2 blocker was started for GI prophylaxis and
aspirin was held in setting of steroids -- latter can be
restarted once prednisone taper is stopped. She will need
rehabilitation with focus on pulmonary treatment.

# Smoking cessation: Dicussed with patient, she will stop
smoking. Nicotine patch give in-house.

# Breast mass: Noted on left breast on physical exam. Recent
normal mammogram in [**2165**] with some fibrocystic changes. Would
defer this to outpatient primary care physician.

# Secondary Polycythemia: Elevated Hematocrit chronic, likely
from uncorrected hypoxemia and history of smoking. Would
recommend continued monitoring.
