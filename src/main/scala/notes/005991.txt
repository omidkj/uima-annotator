CXR [**2187-3-30**]:
The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
pulmonary vascularity is not engorged. Patchy opacity is noted
within the left lung base. The right lung is grossly clear.  No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are mild
degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. Right-sided rib
excrescences are again demonstrated.

IMPRESSION:
Patchy opacity in left lung base which may be infectious in
etiology.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old male with a h/o AML, CKD, and possible COP, now s/p
double cord transplant over three years ago who presents with a
1 day history of fever, cough, malaise, and hypotensive in the
ED.
.
# Fever/Pneumonia:  On admission, pt found to have LLL pneumonia
likely explaining fevers with leukocytosis to 11.8.  Respiratory
viral culture, CMV viral load, urine culture, and blood cultures
were all negative.  Pt was started on vanc/ceftazidime which he
tolerated well.  Fevers resolved and patient became
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the floor.  IV
antibiotics were changed to levofloxacin on HOD # 5 and
SOB/cough continued to improve.  He was discharged on
levofloxacin to complete a total 14 day course of antibiotics.
He was provided with tesslon perels for his cough on discharge
though this had almost entirely improved.
.
# Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive upon admission to the ICU.  He
met SIRS criteria with fever and leukocytosis, though was not
bacteremic.  He was likely dehydrated with poor PO intake in the
days leading up to admission, along with possible adrenal
insufficiency in setting of chronic steroids.  He was fluid
resuscitated with 4L NS in the ED and given Hydrocortisone 100
mg IV.  He was given antibiotics as above, and his lactate
decreased from 2.1 on admission to 1.2 the next day.  He was
switched back to his home dose of Prednisone 3 mg PO daily.  His
BP steadily improved and he was restarted on his home Carvedilol
12.5 mg PO BID, which had been held on admission.  He rema
