Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11784**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation [**2127-8-10**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75yo F PMHx L MCA stroke with residual dysarthria /
aphasia / partial R hemiplegia, AF on coumadin, DM, HTN, HLD,
who initally presented with lethargy to an OSH.  Per patient's
family, they had found her increasingly lethargic that AM, and
"looked sweaty".  At OSH, there was concern for whether or not
neurologic exam findings were acute or chronic (family was not
there to clarify), so patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], intial vital signs were 97.2 70 159/93 18 99%NRB.
Exam was significant for alterred mental status, neuro exam
significant for dysarthria, partial R hemiplegia (family arrived
at this point and reported these were ALL CHRONIC, no new
deficits). NCHCT did not demonstrate any acute changes.  EKG w/o
prior for comparison, demonstrating qwaves.  Labs were
significant for WBC 9.5, Hct 38.1, Cr 0.7, Trop 7.66, UA w 1WBC,
no bacteria.  CXR w/o acute process.  Patient denied CP, SOB,
cough, fever.
.
Given AMS and initial concern for CVA, patient was evaluated by
neurology who felt that given lack of new findings on exam and
imaging, it was unlikely that patient was having a stroke, but
that close neuro monitoring in an ICU was recommended.
.
Given elevated troponin, cardiology was consulted, who felt that
cause of troponin elevation was unclear given ECG without signs
of acute ischemia/infarct in a patient without chest pain; they
felt that potential causes could include demand ischemia [**1-22**]
afib vs neurogenic myocardial mediated by catecholamines.

Patient was admitted to MICU for further monitoring Vital signs
prior to transfer were 96.5 110 114/81 2L98%3LNC.

Patient was comfortable, and on ROS had back pain but no chest
pain, dyspnea, headache, fever, abdominal pain, or extremity
pain.  This was limited by her dysarthria and expressive
aphasia.

Imaging:

[**8-2**] CXR: Mild CHF

[**8-3**] CT Head: There is a moderate sized hypodense area in the
right occipital lobe parasagittal in location, ( se 2, im 15-18)
involving the cortex and adjacent white matter with effacement/
indistinct appearance of the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], representing
an acute infarct in the right PCA territory. D/w Dr.[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91264**]
by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2127-8-3**] at 2.35pm. Cllinical team is aware of
the findings earlier.

[**8-4**] CTA Head and Neck:
HEAD AND NECK CTA: Occlusion of the distal right posterior
cerebral artery,
compatible with distribution of infarction. Otherwise, the
remaining arteries are patent with no evidence of stenosis. No
evidence of aneurysm formation.
IMPRESSION:
1. Extension of the previously described right posterior
cerebellar artery
infarction now including the right occipital and right temporal
lobe.
2. New area of infarction involving the right cerebellar
hemisphere.
3. Occlusion of the distal right posterior cerebellar artery
compatible with the distribution of infarction.
4. No evidence of herniation or midline shift.

[**8-4**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This is a markedly abnormal record. It shows
significant
loss of background frequencies suggestive of either multifocal
disease
or significant encephalopathic component. There are paroxysmal
epileptiform features seen independently in the left central and
over
the right central temporal region. The activity in the right is
occasionally very rhythmic suggesting a brief electrographic
seizure.
These occurred perhaps 30-40 times during the course of the
record and
usually lasted 10-20 seconds in duration. There is no clinical
accompaniment with these events. The cardiac monitor, in
addition, is
abnormal.

[**8-5**] NCHCT
IMPRESSION:
1. Technically limited study due to artifacts from monitoring
devices on the scalp. Evaluation of inferior cerebellar
hemispheres is particularly limited.
2. Evolving infarcts in the right PCA and SCA territories. No
evidence of new intracranial abnormalities.

[**8-5**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This 24-hour recording is most compatible with a
moderately
severe to severe diffuse encephalopathy with multifocal features

suggesting both an encephalopathy and underlying structural
pathology.
The left frontal central region seems to be one area of
independent
abnormality, as well as the more posterior aspects of the right
hemisphere. There were no sustained events that appear to be
compatible
with electrographic seizures and it should be noted that the
record does
wax and wane throughout the course of the 24-hour recording
session.

[**8-6**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This EEG gives evidence for marked encephalopathic
disorder
manifest by marked suppression of normal background rhythms,
suppressive
bursts with periods of one to four seconds of flatline EEG, and
high
voltage triphasic waves that are seen synchronously.
Additionally, at
least two areas appear abnormal independently in that there is
delta and
sharp slow activity in the left frontal region a
