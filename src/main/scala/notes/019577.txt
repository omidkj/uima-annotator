Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/P MV repair (#30 physio ring)[**2198-5-28**]


History of Present Illness:
52-year-old gentleman with a 10 year history of a heart murmur
who was noted to have a more pronounced murmur on exam this past
[**Month (only) 956**]. He was subsequently sent for an echocardiogram which
revealed significant mitral regurgitation.  He underwent an
transesophageal echocardiogram and a cardiac catheterization for
further diagnostic evaluation. His transesophageal
echocardiogram
was reported to have severe mitral regurgitation. He underwent a
cardiac MRI for further assessment which revealed a moderately
dilated left ventricle with a slightly depressed ejection
fraction. He denies any exertional fatigue, shortness of breath,
chest pain, or palpitations. Given thsese findings, he has been
referred for surgical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2198-5-28**]
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. The mitral valve leaflets are elongated. There is
moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There
is partial posterior mitral leaflet flail. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1. Unchanged LV and RV systolic function, with EF = 40-45%.
2. A complete annuloplasty ring is identified in mitralposition.
Well seated and stable with good anterior and posterior leaflet
excursion.
3. Redundant anterior leaflet with chordal [**Male First Name (un) **] is seen. There is
only trace valvular mitral regurgitation, no appreciable LVOT
gradient or any evidence of turbulenty flow in the LVOT.
3. No other change

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted and taken directly to the operating room
where he underwent a mitral valve repair (#30 physio ring II).
Arrived to the ICU immediately post-operatively intubated and
sedated. Awoke from sedation and was weaned from sedation and
extubated. Required NGT drip briefly for hypertension.
Betablockers and diuretics were started on POD#1 and he was
transferred to the stepdown unit for ongoing post-operative
care. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per protocol. He
was noted to have a small left pneumo on CXR but has remained
sable. He was evaluated by physical therapy for strength and
conditioning. He was cleared for discharge to home on POD# 4.
All follow up appointments have been arranged.
