Admission Date:  [**2130-5-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2130-5-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**2059-4-11**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and a remote history of minor hemoptysis who presented to the
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management
of massive hemoptysis from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.

For about one week prior to admission, he noted increased
upper respiratory secretions and a cough which was secondary
to seasonal allergies.

On [**5-21**], the day prior to admission, he coughed up some
gross red blood and went to the local hospital.  He was
intubated there for airway protection and had a flexible
bronchoscopy at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital which showed large clots
diffusely in the airways.

Overnight, on [**5-21**] at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital, his hematocrit
dropped from 40% to 30%, and on the following morning, he had a
repeat bronchoscopy.  At that time, the bronchoscopy revealed
blood throughout the airways, with a possible source
in the left upper lobe apical/posterior segment.  He was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Severe low back pain.
3.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm which is 4 cm in diameter.
4.  History of lacunar cerebellar infarction.
5.  History of hemoptysis one year ago - reported negative
evaluation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Combivent.
2.  OxyContin 80 mg p.o. twice per day.
3.  Percocet five tablets p.o. every day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  His social history includes one pack of
cigarettes per day for over 30 years.  No known alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination, temperature was 100.5, heart rate was 82, blood
pressure was 119/51, respiratory rate was 12, and oxygen
saturation was 100% on 50%.  The patient was ventilated on
assist-control.  He was sedated initially on paralytic agents
to prevent cough.  His lung sounds were coarse throughout,
particularly on the right, with inspiratory wheezes.  His
cardiovascular examination was significant for distant heart
sounds.  A regular rate and rhythm.  A [**1-26**] holosystolic
murmur loudest at the apex.  Abdominal examination revealed
bowel sounds were present.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  Extremity examination revealed cool
extremities.  Pulses were 1+.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   His laboratory
data was notable for a hematocrit of 30.6 and platelets were
199.  Partial thromboplastin time was 27.  INR was 1.  His
electrolytes included a sodium which was 136, potassium was
3.8, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea
nitrogen was 12, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was
92.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient had a chest x-ray
that was unremarkable.  A chest CT showed a 1.5cm nodule in the
left upper lobe (? BAC).

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient was had a flexible
bronchoscopy which revealed old blood diffusely, with a large
clot in the left mainstem.  There were no other endobronchial
lesions.  As to not disturb the clot, a rigid bronchoscopy was
schedueld.

On hospital day two, he had a rigid bronchoscopy that showed
dry blood in the left mainstem, which was removed.  The uptake to
the left lower lobe was erythematous and abnormal in appearance
and brushings, washings and transbronchial needle aspirates were
obtained.

Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be hypertensive, so
he was started on a nitroglycerin drip but otherwise had an
uneventful recovery.  The day after the rigid bronchoscopy
the patient was extubated and had adequate oxygenation for
the duration of his Intensive Care Unit course.

However, on the day following extubation the patient was
noted to have an opacity/infiltrate in the left lower lobe
that was consistent with a ventilator-acquired pneumonia.
Therefore, the patient was started on vancomycin and
ceftazidime.

The diagnosis of pneumonia was consistent with his low-grade
temperatures from 100 to 100.9 in the days following his
extubation.  The patient's oxygen requirements gradually
decreased over the course of his Intensive Care Unit
admission; weaning down to two liters by nasal cannula on the
day of transfer to the floor.

The pathology results from his bronchoscopy came back
negative for malignant cells.  These included two samples of
washings of the bronchial tree as well as a transbronchial
needle aspiration.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was noted throughout
the duration of his Intensive Care Unit stay to be
hypertensive with a blood pressure ranging from the 140s to
over 200 that coincided with his degree of pain medications.

It was noted after his rigid bronchoscopy for his blood
pressure to stay consistently over 200.  Due to concerns
about the effects on his cerebral vasculature, he was started
on a nitroglycerin drip which adequately reduced his blood
pressure into the 150s.  The nitroglycerin drip was turned
off the following day, and he was started on captopril for
afterload reduction, and this was maintained throughout the
remainder of his Intensive Care Unit course; initially
starting at 6.25 mg three times per day and titrating up to
25 mg three times per day.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was noted
following extubation to have a new left lower lobe infiltrate
that was consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia; as
noted above.  He was started on ceftazidime and vancomycin
for this infection which necessitated outpatient intravenous
therapy.

4.  PAIN ISSUES:  The patient came in with a history of
severe low back pain with a home regimen of 80 mg of
OxyContin twice per day with up to five Percocet tablets per
day.  He was initially started on a morphine drip for pain
that was titrated to his blood pressure and heart rate.
Following extubation, these requirements as he was able to
take oral intake.  His narcotic regimen was gradually
increased to his baseline regimen; including 80 mg of
OxyContin and five Percocet tablets.

5.  REHABILITATION ISSUES:  On the day following his
extubation, the patient was seen in consultation by Physical
Therapy who allowed him to walk around the Unit and increase
his capacity which had likely been reduced during his time on
the respirator.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient had a computed
tomography scan of his chest in the middle of his Intensive
Care Unit stay that was notable for a thickened esophagus.
This finding was not inconsistent with an esophageal
malignancy and should be followed up on as an outpatient, and
this was relayed to the floor team.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient to be discharged to the
Medicine Service at the [**Hospital1 69**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hemoptysis.
2.  Ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Severe low back pain.
5.  History of lacunar infarction.
6.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

The patient will follow-up with his referring pulmonologist for a
follow-up chest CT to evalute the nodule seen in the left upper
lobe (? BAC).
