History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81021**] is a 76 year old male who presented to outside
hospital on [**3-8**] for revision of left hip prosthesis and
underwent surgery. He was doing well post-operatively, ambulated
with physical therapy today without symptoms, however when he
returned to bed he developed crushing substernal chest pain with
radiation to bilateral arms and the back of his neck. He had
never experienced pain like this before. It was associated with
shortness of breath and diaphoresis. He did not have nausea. He
was treated with nitro paste, morphine, aspirin, and IV
metoprolol. He believes the morphine relieved the chest pain.
CXR reportedly showed pulmonary vascular congestion. Labs
returned with CK 771, Trop 3.63, Hct 27.7. He has been pain free
since the original episode aside from a 20 second period of
shortness of breath which occurred at 4PM and resolved on its
own. He is transferred for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred from [**Hospital6 **] after ruling in
for non ST elevation myocardial infarction.  He was found to
have epitaxis with integrilin and ENT was consulted, nose was
packed and no further occurence with intergrilin stopping.  Was
also noted to have hematoma at left hip and orthopedic surgery
was consulted, it remained stable, required no surgical
intervention and no evidence of sciatic nerve dysfunction. He
underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated extensive
three vessel disease as well as aortic stenosis. He underwent
surgical evaluation for cardiac surgery.  On [**2114-3-16**] he was
brought to the operating room and underwent coronary artery
bypass graft surgery and aortic valve replacement.  See
operative report for further details.  He received vancomycin
for perioperative antibiotics.  He was transferred to the
intensive care unit for hemodynamic monitoring.  He required
inotropes due to systolic heart failure but were weaned off in
the first twenty four hours postoperatively.  He was also weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated.
He remained in the intensive care unit for hemodynamic
monitoring, and had atrial fibrillation post operative day one
at night, treated with betablockers and amidarone which after a
few hours converted to normal sinus rhythm.  He was transferred
to the floor for the remainder of his care.  He had intermittent
episodes of atrial fibrillation and was started on coumadin for
anticoagulation.  On post-operative day three he was found to
have a right forearm phlebitis.  Further, there was a small
amount of sero-sanguinous drainage from his mediastinal
incision.  He was placed on Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.  On
the following day the sternal drainage abated.  The forearm had
improved, but because Mr. [**Known lastname 81021**] has a new aortic valve, a
PICC was placed and a plan was set for 2 weeks of IV Vancomycin
and oral ciprofloxacin.  Vanco troughs should accordlingly be
followd along with the progress of these wounds.  On the
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.  He
continued to progress and was ready for discharge to rehab on
post operative day four.
