Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left  ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber  size and free wall motion
are normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated.  Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. [Intrinsic right
ventricular  systolic function is likely more depressed given
the severity of tricuspid  regurgitation.] The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace  aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are  mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is  severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-1-4**]
estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
.
CXR [**7-19**]:
1. Increased interstitial markings, nonspecific in appearance.
Differential diagnosis includes CHF or other interstitial
processes. The appearance is likely accentuated by low
inspiratory volumes.

2. Bibasilar atelectasis and small effusions. An early
infiltrate would be difficult to exclude in this setting.

3. There has been some interval clearing of the left base
compared with [**2199-7-17**]. Otherwise, no significant change is
identified.

4. PICC line tip difficult to visualize.

3. ET tube and NG tube removed compared with [**2199-7-17**].


Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo F with DM, HTN, AFib presents with LLE cellulitis,
refractory to oral Abx.
.
#. Respiratory distress/decreased oxygen saturation: Pt noted to
have decreased oxygendation saturations on HD #[**1-5**], dropping
into the 70s while on RA with improvement to the 90s on oxygen.
On HD #6, pt was sent to the ICU for hypoxia and for initiation
of BiPAP with the thought that OSA was contributing to the
hypoxia.  During her ICU stay, pt developed worsening hypoxia.
She was initially treated empirically for a PE with a heparin
drip but this was stopped after a VQ scan was low probability.
Due to increasing hypoxia and resp distress, she was intubated.
due to CHF, aspiration pneumonia and OSA.  She was diuresed with
a lasix drip, treated with cipro and vancomycin for possible
aspiration pneumonia and she was successfully extubated on HD#14
after eight days.  She did well and was sent to the floor. On
the floor, she still required 6L of O2 to maintain sats in the
low 90s.  She continued to be diuresed with 80mg of IV lasix [**Hospital1 **]
but when her urine output dropped, Diuril was added to the
lasix, 30 minutes before.  Her BP was controlled as below.  She
diuresed 1-1.5L per day and her creatinine remained stable at
her baseline of 1.5-1.7. She should continue to be diuresed with
lasix and diuril to maintain goal of 1L negative per day.  She
was treated with 14 days of vanc and 10 days of cipro for her
aspiration PNA.
.
# Obstructive Sleep apnea: Pt had been on CPAP 3 years ago but
discontinued due to repeatedly having to take the mask off at
night due to urinary incontinence and repeated trips to the
bathroom.  As above, it was thought that OSA was contributing to
her hypoxia but she was not tried on BiPAP while in ICU.  We
attempted to try mask on the floor but she did not tolerate.  Pt
would benefit from additional sleep study testing as an
outpatient.
.
# Hypertension: Pt's BP was difficult to control in the
hospital.  She cannot tolerate beta blockers due to bradycardia.
 She was continued on diltiazem, norvasc, lisinopril and
hydralazine.  Her hydralazine was discontinued due to poor
outpatient choice for BP control and clonidine patch was
started.  Due to bradycardia, her diltiazem was decreased to
60mg qid and clonidine patch increased.  She tolerated these
adjustments well and her BP was stable in the 130s/80s.
.
# Afib: Pt is chronically in afib but has refused
anticoagulation.  She is very well rate controlled on calcium
channle blocker.  Her digoxin was stopped as it was thought that
is was not needed for rate control and is not indicated for her
diastolic heart failure.
.
# Cellulitis: Cellulitis not resolving with outpatient PO
amoxicillin/clavulanate. Pt. is afebrile, hemodynamically
stable, with white count trending upwards. Wound Cx positive for
and treated for Pseudomonas sensitive to Ciprofloxacin.
Bilateral LE US to r/o DVT was negative.  She was treated for 10
days with ciprofloxacin.  Podiatry followed patient while in
house.
.
#. Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, creatinine
increased to 1.5 from baseline of 1.3-1.4.  This increased to
2.0 and her lasix was held due to thought of volume depletion.
With some fluids and holding renally cleared meds, creatinine
stabilized to 1.5-1.6.  This remained stable even with
reinitiation of lasix and ACE.  She likely requires a higher
creatinine to maintain euvolemic state.
.
# DM: Pt with some episodes of asymptomatic hypoglycemia while
in house. Her 70/30 was titrated to decrease hypoglycemia.
.
#. Urinary incontinence: Foley was kept in to watch I2 and Os
carefully.  Oxybutynin was stopped due to foley and incidence of
orthostatic hypotension.
.
# Diarrhea
