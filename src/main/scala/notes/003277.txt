History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 84 yo female with h/o diastolic CHF who presents
with dyspnea and lower extremity edema. The patient states that
she has been having increasing lower extremity edema for the
past 3 weeks.  Last night, she woke up in the middle of the
night to go to the bathroom and experienced abdominal cramping.
She called the nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 100**] Rehab, who evaluated the patient
and found her to be dyspneic and satting 94% on room air.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 94752**] denies orthopnea, as she states she now always sleeps on
an incline because of her C2-C4 fusion in [**Month (only) 359**].  The patient
also denies PND and states that she never felt subjectively
dyspneic.  Of note, the patient states that she takes Lasix 40
mg daily and has been compliant with her medications.  She also
denies eating many salty foods, but admits to frequent
consumption of soups.
.
In the ED, the patient's VS were BP 189/86, P 76, R 20, O2 74%
on 4L.  She was placed on Bipap and received Lasix 80 mg IV, ASA
325 mg, was placed on a nitro gtt.  An ECG demonstrated that the
patient is in AFib, which is altered from her previous baseline.
 The patient diuresed 1.1L and her O2 requirement decreased to
2L.  She was then admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for further workup and
evaluation.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.   Cardiac review of
systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

.
[**2199-12-2**] EKG - Sinus bradycardia. Left axis deviation likely due
to left anterior fascicular block. Lateral ST-T wave changes are
non-specific. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-11-29**] the
findings are similar.
.
[**2199-12-2**] echo - The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac shunt identified. Mild aortic valve
stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
[**12-1**] - echo - IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Bilateral simple
renal cysts.
.
[**12-1**] PA/Lateral chest x-ray - FINDINGS: Comparison is made to
prior study of [**2199-11-27**]. There is again seen bibasilar
atelectasis and small pleural effusions. There are no signs of
overt pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation is seen. The
filter and spinal fixation hardware is again seen.
.
[**2199-11-24**] - CT chest - IMPRESSION:
1. New centrilobular "tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]" and nodular opacities in the
lower lobes and right middle lobe consistent with infection or
aspiration.
2. Moderate centrilobular upper lobe predominant emphysema.
3. Extensive moderate aortic valve calcifications of uncertain
physiologic
significance.
.
[**12-2**] - echo with bubble study - IMPRESSION: No intracardiac
shunt identified. Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Hypoxia: With pulmoary engorment on CXR and elevated BNP of
9000 and new AF, the etiology of the patient's hypoxia was felt
to be acute exacerbation of diastolic dysfunction.  Over the
course of her 4 day admission, the patient had been diureesed
with IV lasix with removal of 6 liters.  The patient had
continued to be hypoxic during the hospitalization, and a chest
CT was obtained, showing a question of right middle and lower
lobe infitrate vs. aspiration.  The patinet was  started on
levofloxacin/vanc/flagyl to treat a potential pneumonia.  The
patiet triggered after being noted to be hypoxic at 76% on 4L
NC, 82% on 6L NRB despite the aggressive diuresis.  The patient
was transfered to the CCU for futher care.
   Differential for patient's hypoxia included blossoming PNA
vs. aspiration pneumonitis vs. flash pulmonary edema with dCHF
and AF vs. PE.  The patient had been significantly diureesed
during the course of the hospitalization, and on exam appeared
euvolemic to dry.  Patient was not acutly hypertensive during
inciting event.  Chest XR was without evidence of acute
pulmonary edema.  The patient was being treated for pneumonia
and had been afebrile.  Chest CT showed dependent area of
nodular opacities which could be consistent with likely
aspiration pneumonia.  Patient has a history of severe
aspiration on swallow study, and felt that this would be most
likely explanation of patinet's hypoxia.  PE seems less likely
given supratherapeutic INR throughout hospitalization and IVC
filter in place.
   The patient's O2 requirement improved over three days.  She
was given supportive nebs and a course of solumendral given
wheezes on physical exam.  With high O2 requirement, pulmonary
was consulted, who agreed that aspiration pn
