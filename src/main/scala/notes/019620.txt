CT C/A/P
IMPRESSION:
1.  The pancreas is enhancing homogeneously.  There are multiple
peripancreatic fluid collections as described above which are
essentially
stable.
2.  Small amount of free fluid.
3.  Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis are stable.
4.  Anasarca

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  75F with Hx of Parkinson's admitted with gallstone
pancreatitis and suspected cholangitis.

1. Gallstone pancreatitis/Cholangitis- on admission: [**Last Name (un) 5063**]
criteria- at least 4 points- motality 15-20%.  Abdominal U/S
with stones in gallbladder, no stones in CBD, CBD not dilated.
Since the stones had passed, no ERCP was done at this time.
The patient was kept NPO and treated with aggressive IVF
hydration with NS on admission.  As her Na rose, free water
boluses were used (free water deficit measured as 2L on [**7-24**]).
She was also treated with Unasyn to cover enterococci, gram
negatives, and anaerobes.  A 7 day course was completed. A CT
abd on [**7-25**] showed no necrosis, no hemorrhage, large
peripancreatic fluid, and a small amount of intraabdominal
ascites.  Morphine was used for pain control.

2. Tachycardia/afib and HTN:
The patient was maintained on metoprolol 37.5 TID.  During her
initial ICU stay, the patient has gone in and out of rapid
atrial fibrillation (HR to 190's).  Also with several runs of
sinus tachycardia (to 180's). Usually responsive to Diltiazam.
EKGs during rapid A.Fib showed rate dependent t wave inversions.
(Home HTN meds: metoprolol 25mg TID, lasix 40mg QD, captopriil
25mg TID)

3. Pain was controlled with morphine as needed (meperidine held
b/c of old age and risk of seizure).

4. Hypernatremia: Na trended up to 147 on [**2199-7-26**].  Responsive to
free water boluses through NG tube.

5. [**Name (NI) **] pt had elevated trop- max 0.4 at OSH trended downward,
with negative CK, likely from demand ischemia.  Trop down to
0.11 from 0.13 here. An EGK showed no evidence of ischemic
changes.  No old EKG available for comparison. Pt was started on
ASA, and low dose BB. Statin was not started as pt was NPO at
this time. Pt was also not heparinized due to risk of
hemorrhagic pancreatitis

6. Tachypnea: pt has been tachypneic with hypercarbia

7. FEN: Had IR placed post-pyloric dobhoff.

8. Parkinson's: held sinemet (Home dose of Sinemet 50/200 QID).

8. PPx- SC heparin, pneumoboots, PPI

9. Glucose control: Insulin SC sliding scale.

10. [**Name (NI) 2638**] HCP is daughter [**State 64162**] Cell: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64163**]
Home: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64164**]
PCP is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 56152**]

11. Pt was DNR/DNI. On [**7-30**], she was again transferred to
the ICU for fevers, respiratory failure, worsening hypoxemia,
and mental status changes. Following a discussion between the
ICU team and the pt's family, she was made CMO. She expired
shortly thereafter.
