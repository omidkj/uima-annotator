BRIEF HISTORY:   Patient is a 63 year old male who has not
sought care
for many years.  He presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] last week with
CHF.  He
was diuresed 20 pounds and diagnosed with having diabetes.  EF
was 40%
on echo with mild LVH.  He is now referred for cath for new
diagnosis of
cardiomyopathy.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
CHF, cardiomyopathy

PROCEDURE:
RIGHT HEART CATH- was performed via 8F sheath in Right Femoral
Vein via
a PA catheter.
LEFT HEART CATH- was performed via a 5F sheath in Right Femoral
Artery.
Multiple projections of coronary arteries were performed with 5F
JL4 and
JR4.
VENTRICULOGRAM was performed wia a 5F pigtail with 39 cc of
contrast
injected over 3 seconds.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography in this
co-dominant
patient revealed severe three vessel native coronary disease.
The LMCA
had a distal 40% stenosis.  The LAD had a 90% long tubular
stenosis
proximally.  The LCX system was diffusely diseased with 80%
large OM1,
small diffusely diseased OM2 and 90% large OM3.  The mid LCX had
a 60%
lesion and the distal LCX had a 95% lesion before the last
posterolateral.  The ramus was small and diffusely diseased with
a 95%
mid lesion.  It gave off a very small PDA.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severe elevation of right and
left
sided filling pressures with mean RA of 16mmHG and mean PCWP of
31mmHG.
The LVEDP was also elevated at 35mmHG and there was
moderate-severe
elevation of pulmonary pressures with mean PA of 39mmHG.  The
cardiac
index was depressed at 2.11.  There was no gradient on aortic
valve
pullback.  Systemic blood pressure was normal at 106/67
3.  Ventriculogram revealed moderate global hypokinesis with a
dilated
ventricule. There was severe anteroapical hypokinesis. EF was
about 35%
with mild mitral regurgitation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systolic dysfunction
3. Severe diastolic dysfunction with elevated right and left
filling
pressures and reduced cardiac index.
