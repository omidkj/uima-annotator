Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
Right above the knee amputation
Central Line placement
PEG tube placement

History of Present Illness:
67 y/o male with severe RA was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a
tracheostomy.  He initially was admitted to an OSH with
respiratory failure appromixately 6 weeks prior to admission to
[**Hospital1 18**], thought to be secondary to a viral illness, during which
time he was sucessfully intubated and extubated, and, upon
recovery, was transferred to a rehab facility.  At the rehab, he
was involved in a wheelchair accident that resulted in a right
tibial fracture, for which he was re-admitted to the OSH and
underwent a successful ORIF.  However, post-operatively he
developed hypercarbic respiratory failure; he was unable to be
intubated due to a difficult airway so underwent a nasotracheal
intubation.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tracheostomy.
On admission, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable but was
found to have severe musculoskeletal deformities from his RA.
His lower extremities showed signs of severe skin changes and
necrosis (especially of the toes) with obvious super-infection.

Past Medical History:
Rheumatoid arthritis on chronic steroids
Hip and shoulder replacements
Recent respiratory failure from unknown viral infection

Social History:
Patient had previously been fairly independent, but with the
progressive worsening of his RA had become increasingly
dependent on family and health aides over the past few years.
No recent tobacco use.

Family History:
No family history of RA.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o male with severe [**Hospital **] transferred from outside hospital for
tracheostomy and found to have lower extremity necrosis and
infection.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] initially had a succesfuly tracheostomy placement.
Given the appearance of his legs, especially the right side,
orthopedic, podiatric, and wound consults were called.  As he
began growing out pseudomonas, he was started on ciprofloxacin
and gentamicin, given the sensitivities.  He began to develop
signs of sepsis, with decreasing blood pressure, tachycardia,
and increasing WBC.  Levophed was started to support his blood
pressure.  In discussions with orthopedics, the patient, and his
family, it was decided that as his right lower extremity was the
likely nidus of infection, an amputation was indicated.  He went
to the OR and had a succesful right AKA.  Upon returing,
however, he showed little clinical improvement, remaining
pressor depedent.  He also developed new onset afib with rapid
ventricular response; to investigate the cause, he had full
electrolytes drawn, and ecg was checked, he was ruled-out for
MI, and had a CTA to evaluate for pulmonary embolus, all of
which was negative.  He was rate controlled with intermittent
diltiazem.  However, Mr. [**Known lastname **] overall clinical picture
continued to deteriorate, with increasing pressor requirements
and declining mental status.  His blood cultures grew out a
highly resistant E. faecium.  A family discussion was held, and
they felt that given his baseline severe chronic illness, his
quality of life, even if an aggressive course of treatment for
his acute illness was successful, would remain quite poor.
Based on this discussion, support was withdrawn, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
made comfortable, and he died shortly therafter.
