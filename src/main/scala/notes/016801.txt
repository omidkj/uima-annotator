Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 2184**] [**Known lastname 14096**] is an 81 yo f with a history of COPD on 2L of home
O2 at baseline, and dementia who presents with dyspnea to [**Hospital1 18**]
from her [**Hospital1 1501**].  She complained of shortness of breath today at
her [**Hospital1 1501**] and was noted to be coughing.  She desaturated to 77% on
2L NC.  She was given nebs without relief and sent to the ED.
The patient reports that she feels generally unwell, but cannot
be more specific.  She denies shortness of breath, cough, fevers
or chills when questioned.  She is alert and in no apparent
distress.  Family members report good PO intake.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.8 98 93/75 24 oxygen saturation
81% while receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at
2L/min. Patient was given Albuterol and Ipratropium Nebs,
MethylPREDNISolone Sodium Succ 125mg IV x1, CeftriaXONE 1g IV
x1, Acetaminophen 650mg PO x 1, Levofloxacin 750mg IVx1.  She
was found to have a PNA on CXR.  She was put on CPAP briefly but
that seemed to make her more uncomfortable.  Her blood pressure
dropped to 60/30 at worst.  She was given 3L of fluid and
started on levofed prior to transfer.   She was febrile to 101.8
in the ED and current VS are: 103/79 21 96% NRB.

Micro:
[**10-27**] Blood Cx pending
[**10-28**] RSV Screen negative

Imaging:
[**10-27**] EKG - Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. No
change from prior.
[**10-27**] CXR - This study is extremely limited by low lung volumes
and motion. A focal opacity of the left mid lung is similar in
location to the previous study. Prominence of the pulmonary
vasculature may reflect pulmonary edema and/or crowding of
structures due to low lung volumes. The cardiac silhouette is
accentuated by low lung volumes.
[**10-28**] CXR - There are persistent low lung volumes. Mildly
enlarged cardiac silhouette is accentuated by the low lung
volumes and their projection. If any, there are small bilateral
pleural effusions. There is mild vascular congestion. The
central main pulmonary arteries are prominent. Left lower lobe
retrocardiac opacity has increased, a combination of pleural
effusion and atelectasis.
[**10-30**] CXR - As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities, the moderate
cardiomegaly and the relatively extensive bilateral hilar masses
are unchanged in extent and severity. Also unchanged is the
diffuse increase in density of the entire lung parenchyma. The
lung volumes are still below average. No changes have newly
occurred.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 81 yo F with history of COPD, dementia, HTN
presenting with dyspnea/hypoxia, likely related to PNA and
septic physiology.

# Respiratory Status: Patient was admitted with elevated WCC,
CXR w lower lobe consolidations bilaterally and new onset
dyspnea/hypoxia.  Given that patient was a [**Hospital1 1501**] resident, she was
being broadly covered for HCAP with vanco, cefepime and cipro.

#Bacterial Conjunctivitis: Pt admitted with bilateral injection
of sclera with pus-like exudate.  She was treated with erythro
and cipro eye drops.

# Hypotension: Patient admitted with hypotension most likely
from septic etiology given source of PNA.  Was treated as
discussed above, briefly required peripheral pressors, but was
then able to maintain MAPs >65 without support.

# Acute Kidney Injury on chronic kidney disease: Admitted with
Cr 2.1 up from baseline of 1.2.   Likely pre-renal associated
with hypotension [**3-13**] sepsis.  Cr resolved with volume
resuscitation.

# Heart Failure: Day#3 of hospitalization, CXR demonstrated and
CXR increased infiltrates and effusions thought to be secondary
to CHF.  Patient was gently diuresed with improved physical
exam.  However as discussed below her respiratory requirements
did not improve.

#Acute Respiratory Failure: Despite treatment of PNA and CHF,
patient had increasing O2 requirements.  By Day#4, patient was
requiring vented face mask and was laboring to maintain her sats
above 90%.  This was of uncertain etiology.  After meeting with
the family, patient was made comfort measures only.  In the
pressence of her family, patient expired at 8:58pm on [**10-30**].
