Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
63 year-old man with a history significant for stage IIIA NSCLC
(dx [**11-24**]) s/p right pneumonectomy ([**6-25**]), presented to the ED
with increasing productive cough and dyspnea over several days.

The morning of admission he had been doing errands and found
himself getting increasingly SOB (specifically that he could not
catch his breath). He got home at which time EMS was called, and
he was transported to the ED. He has DOE at baseline, but noted
worsening DOE over the past several days. He also has a chronic
cough with productive sputum, but noted this being worse
recently as well, and noted a yellow discoloration. On admission
he also c/o chest heaviness and diaphoresis. Denies
palpitations, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Additional ROS: He reports decreased appetite (despite using
Megace) and weight loss. His baseline weight is approx 180 lbs
before his dx of lung CA. After his pneumonectomy he was as low
as 140 lbs, and has fluctuated between 140-150 lbs for the last
several weeks. Over the past weeks he has reported some night
sweats, but no rigors or fevers. He denies orthopnea or PND at
home prior to admission, although he coughs a lot during the
night. He has a chronic cough and has difficulty clearing sputum
(which is occasionally green in color). No blood in sputum. He
was given a 2-week course of Levaquin (started [**11-9**]) due to
concern for superimposed bronchitis. Cough improved with abx
treatment. No pneumonia seen on recent CXR prior to admission.
In addition, the patient has a history of respiratory tract
infections during hospitalizations within the past year. During
his [**4-25**] hospitalization, sputum cultures grew GNR and MSSA.
During his [**6-25**] hospitalization, sputum cultures grew MRSA and
he was treated with Vancomycin and later transitioned to
Linezolid on discharge for a total of a 10-day course.

The patient additionally reports right-sided chest pain and pain
with swallowing. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is aware of this and has been
working up this issue. In prior exams he has had no evidence of
thrush or mouth ulcers. It has been suggested that mediastinal
lymphadenopathy is a possible cause of his dysphagia. The
patient may have had a barium swallow last Tuesday?. Of concern
is that this pain with swallowing is contributing to his poor
intake. He was taking OxyContin 10mg [**Hospital1 **] and an occasional
oxycodone with decent relief of his right-sided chest pain/pain
with swallowing.

He reports a long-standing hx of diarrhea, although none since
his SBO/LOA in [**4-25**]. He does report occasional constipation for
which he takes Ex-Lax. He has blood on the toilet paper when he
is constipated, which is attributes to his hemorrhoids. Denies
melena or recent changes in his bowels. He also reports pain in
his left knee and loss of hearing in his right ear.

Past Medical History:
1) Non-small-cell lung cancer dx [**11-24**]. RLL, stage IIIA,
squamous type. He had two cycles of induction chemotherapy w/
Carboplatin and Taxol (initiated [**2172-12-22**]) followed by concurrent
XRT with Taxotere chemotherapy (initiated [**2173-2-2**]). He was
scheduled to undergo surgical resection on [**4-25**], but it was
deferred secondary to SBO/LOA. Pneumonectomy performed on [**6-25**]
w/ radical mediastinal lymph node dissection and a muscle flap.
He was found to have recurrent lung cancer in the mediastinal
area on [**10-25**] PET scan. Now taking Taxotere and has had 3 doses
(once per week for 3 weeks -[**11-9**], [**11-15**], [**11-23**]). He is followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

2) SBO s/p emergent exploratory laparotomy ([**4-25**]). LOA
performed. Two small perforations were found in the small bowel;
these were repaired. Concern for sepsis post-op.

3) HTN. At 10/25 visit BP was low at 86/56 so the patient was
told to take only half of his Toprol XL pill.

4) Depressed Cardiac Function. Echo [**6-25**]: Estimated EF 35%. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Global hypokinesis. RV
systolic function depressed. 1+ AR, 1+ MR.

5) Hemorrhoids and anal fissure s/p lateral sphincterotomy
([**11-24**]).

6) GERD.

7) Laparotomy s/p gunshot wound to the abdomen when he was in
high school.

Social History:
Married w/ 1 son (age 35). He works as a custodian for [**University/College **]
[**Location (un) **]. He has a significant (40 pack-year) smoking history.
Also has a history of alcohol use. He quit both cigarettes and
alcohol 6 months ago. No recreational drug use. Has difficulty
with a low Na diet.

HTN, and heart disease runs in his family.

CXR [**12-4**] (AP): There is again evidence of prior pneumonectomy
with white-out of the right lung and surgical clips seen in the
superior right hilum. The left lung is clear without
pneumothorax, effusion, or focal consolidation. There is
expected shift to the right of the mediastinum. Degenerative
changes are noted in the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION: Expected
post-surgical changes with unremarkable left lung.
