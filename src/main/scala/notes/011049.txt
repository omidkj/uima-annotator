AGE:  52.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old male
patient with a known history of coronary artery disease, who
is status post myocardial infarction followed by three-vessel
coronary artery bypass graft in [**2126**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with unstable
angina.  He has had recent increase in symptoms about a month
prior to admission.  On the day of admission to the hospital,
the patient had significant increase in symptoms and was
directed to the emergency department.  He was admitted to the
Cardiology Medicine Service at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, as previously stated.
2.  Hypertension, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia, status post right rotator cuff
surgery repair, status post right submandibular gland removal
secondary to stone and erectile dysfunction.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prinivil 10 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Atenolol 10 mg p.o.q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
4.  The patient also is enrolled in a study for
hypercholesterolemia for which he is on unknown medication,
as well as vitamin C and vitamin E.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed the following:  Vital signs were within normal
limits.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS:  Lungs
were clear to auscultation, bilaterally.  CARDIOVASCULAR:
Examination revealed regular rate and rhythm with grade 2/6
systolic murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Obese and benign.  EXTREMITIES:
Unremarkable with palpable pulses.  NEUROLOGICAL:
Neurologically, he was alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II
to XII grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values, upon admission to the
hospital were all unremarkable.  The patient's EKG revealed
normal sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block, no
Q-waves or ST-wave abnormalities.  The patient was admitted
to the telemetry floor on the Cardiology Medicine Service.

The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory on [**2146-1-12**].  Cardiac catheterization
revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease, occluded
saphenous vein graft to the circumflex, LAD, as well as a
patent saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.  He
also was found to have mild left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, as well as elevated left ventricular and
diastolic pressure.

Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation was obtained at that
time.  It was felt that the patient should be taken to the
operating room for redo coronary artery bypass graft.

On [**2146-1-13**], the patient was taken to the
operating room, where he underwent redo coronary artery
bypass graft times three; with LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein to
OM2, saphenous vein to diagonal branch.  (please see
operative note for full details of surgical procedure)

Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the
operating room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit with an
intraaortic balloon pump in place.  He was on Levophed,
Milrinone, Insulin and Amiodarone drips.  The patient was
placed on IV Pressonex drip for sedation due to a
questionable adverse reaction in the operating room to
propofol.

On postoperative day #1, the patient had stabilized overnight
and was slowly weaned off his vasoactive and inotropic drips.
The intraaortic balloon pump was discontinued late in the day
on postoperative day #1.  He was weaned from the mechanical
ventilator and ultimately extubated on that day as well.

On postoperative day #2, the patient had remained
hemodynamically stable.  Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued.
The IV Amiodarone was converted to oral.  Chest tubes were
discontinued and he was transferred from the ICU to the
Cardiothoracic Telemetry Floor.  Later in the day, on
postoperative day #2, it was noted that the patient had an
episode of atrial fibrillation.  Blood pressure was stable at
that time and he was maintained on his Amiodarone.

Over the next twenty-four hours the patient had a few more
episodes of atrial fibrillation.  He was started on Lopressor
and this was increased.  He converted to normal sinus rhythm,
early in the morning of [**Month (only) 1096**] and he has remained in
normal sinus rhythm since that time.  The patient was begun
on physical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation.  He has
progressed with increasing mobility.  The epicardial pacing
wires were discontinued on [**1-17**].  The patient was
being diuresed and tolerating that well.  He remained
afebrile.  He continued to progress from the cardiac
rehabilitation standpoint.

Today, on postoperative day #5, [**2146-1-18**] the
patient remained stable and is ready to be discharged home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  Temperature is 99.4, pulse
70, normal sinus rhythm.  Regular rate and rhythm 20:  Blood
pressure 135/75.  Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air.  Most
recent laboratory values are from [**2146-1-17**], which
include a white blood cell count of 10.8, hematocrit of 23.4,
platelet count 141,000, sodium 139, potassium 4.1, chloride
100, CO2 30, BUN 26, creatinine 0.9, glucose 146.
Prothrombin time 13.4.  Weight today, [**1-18**], is
125.6  kg, which is up from his preoperative weight of 117.8.
Neurologically, the patient is grossly intact with no
apparent focal deficits.  Pulmonary examination is
unremarkable.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Coronary examination is regular rate and rhythm with no rubs
nor murmurs.  Abdomen is obese, soft, and nontender with
positive bowel sounds.  Sternum is stable.  Staples to the
sternal incisions are intact.  There is no erythema or
drainage.  There is a scant amount of serous drainage from
his old chest-tube site.  Left flank incisions are clean,
dry, and intact with no erythema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o.b.i.d. times one week.
3.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. times one week.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
5.  Zantac 150 mg p.o.b.i.d.
6.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
7.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.b.i.d. times five days, then 400 mg
p.o.q.d. time two weeks, then 200 mg p.o.q.d.
8.  Ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o.t.i.d.
9.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o.q.4h.p.r.n.pain.
10. Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o. q.6h.p.r.n.pain.

FOLLOW-UP CARE:  The patient is to followup with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one month for postoperative check.  The patient is
to followup with primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1395**] in
two to three weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease status post
redo coronary artery bypass graft times three.


DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.
