Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: pneumonia vs. Cardiac?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
38 year old woman with sob, decreased o2 saturation, fevers
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pneumonia vs. Cardiac?
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Shortness of breath, decreased
saturations, and fever.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to [**2123-5-2**].

There are bilateral widespread opacities, predominantly patchy
and some of them nodular involving mostly the right lower and
the entire left lung. They are completely new in comparison to
the previous chest x-ray. There is no sizable pleural effusion.
The heart size is grossly unchanged only related to lower lung
volumes.

IMPRESSION: New bibasilar patchy consolidations. Given the
patient's history of immunocompromising due to treatment with
methotrexate and steroids, the infection such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1065**],
atypical viral infection should be suspected but
community-acquired pneumonia cannot be excluded. Close followup
with chest x-ray or CT is recommended

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). TVI E/e' < 8, suggesting normal PCWP (<12mmHg). No
resting LVOT
gradient. No LV mass/thrombus. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP. Normal
mitral valve supporting structures. Normal LV inflow pattern for
age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal
tricuspid valve supporting structures. Normal PA systolic
pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal
image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal image quality
- poor apical
views. Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Suboptimal image
quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes. The
patient appears to
be in sinus rhythm. Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%). Tissue
velocity imaging
demonstrates an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular
filling pressure
(<12mmHg). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

An acoustic density measuring approximately 24 by 13 mm is
present abutting
the free wall of the right atrium. Although this finding could
represent an
artifact due to the technically suboptimal nature of this study,
a mass such a
thrombus cannot be excluded.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2122-9-17**], a new acoustic density (mass vs artifact) is now
seen in the
right atrium. A transesophageal echocardiogram could better
define this
anomaly if clinically indicated.
