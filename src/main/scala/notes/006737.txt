RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2106-7-12**] 11:15 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o inf., effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old woman with CAD
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf., effusion
EXAMINATION: PA and lateral chest.

HISTORY: Coronary artery disease. Possible pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to prior chest
radiographs since [**2106-6-26**], most recently [**2106-7-7**].

Since [**7-7**], the Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, and
there is less mediastinal vascular engorgement. Moderate
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is also decreased. Small
bilateral pleural effusions and mild left lower lobe atelectasis
are new. The upper lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax.

A right PIC catheter projects over the expected course to the
SVC.

COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary coronary angiography revealed a right
dominant
system with three vessel coronary artery disease. The [**Month (only) **] had a
50%
distal bifurcation lesion. The LAD had 50% ostial disease with a
70%
ostial small D2 lesion. The LCX had had sequential 90%, 50%, and
70% mid
vessel lesions. The RCA had mild ostial disease
and an 80% mid vessel lesion at the origin of a large acute
marginal
branch which had sequential 90% lesions, and 70% mid to distal
disease.
  2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated significantly
elevated
system pressures with moderately elevated left sided pressures
(LVEDP 28
mmHg) and no gradient upon movement of the catheter from the
ventricle
back to the aorta.
  3. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel and moderate left main coronary artery disease.
2. Mild elevation of left ventricular diastolic pressure.

Brief Hospital Course:
She presented to the ER on [**6-26**] and was hypertensive in the
180s-200s.  She ruled in for an MI and was started on heparin
and Plavix.  She had a negative MRI/MRA of the chest. Hematology
saw her for the G6PD and found that she does not have it, she is
a
carrier, and she was started on ASA.
She had angina at rest and was hypertensive when this would
occur.  On [**6-30**] she underwent cardiac cath which revealed:
50%[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 2435**]., 50% ostial LAD, 70% ostial D2, 90% LCX, and 80%
mid RCA lesion.  She had an echo which showed an EF of 60-70%
and minimal AS.
Following her cath, her creatinine rose and peaked at 2.9.
Eventually it came down to 2.4 and on [**7-6**] she had a CABGx4 w/
LIMA->LAD, SVG->RCA, OM, and Ramus.  She tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CSRU on Neo and Propofol in
stable condition. She was extubated on POD#1 and her urine
output dwindled on that day.  Renal was consulted and she was
given volume and Lasix and this eventually resolved.
She continued to progress and had her chest tubes out on POD#1
and epicardial pacing wires on POD#3.  She was transferred to
the floor on POD#3 and required aggressive antihypertensive
therapy.  Her creatinine came down to 2.1, and she progressed
slowly and was discharged to rehab on POD#7 in stable condition.
