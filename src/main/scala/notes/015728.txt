Reports:
CT head: No acute intracranial hemorrhage seen

MRA: No evidence of significant renal artery stenosis

Multiple renal cysts; two lesions in the left kidney may
represent hemorrhagic cysts but are not definitively
characterized. Followup study is recommended to assess for any
size change.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 77 y.o. Female with history of resistant htn, DM II,
Right subclavian stenosis s/p recent hospitalization for HTN
complicated by stroke p/w SOB.

The patient initially presented with dyspnea, hypoxia and
[**Month/Day/Year **] BP.  Her hypoxia was initially attributed to CHF
secondary to diet non-adherence, decreased diuretic therapy as
well as diastolic dysfunction. She was placed on CPAP with
initial improvement in oxygenation. Aggressive diuresis was
attempted; however, urine output dropped off accompanied by
rising Cr. BP control was attempted with multiple agents with
little success. Of note, BP exacerabations were largely
accompanied increased agitation and delerium at night. On [**8-16**],
the patient began to tire on CPAP with worsening sats and was
intubated. Central venous access was obtained and an arterial
line was also placed. The patient subsequently underwent MRA to
evaluate for renal artery stenosis as underlying etiology of
resistant HTN which was negative. After intubation, the patient
began to auto-diurese.  This was augmented with Lasix and
Metolazone and by the end of her MICU stay, the patient was
nearly 7L negative.  On [**8-19**] the patient was extubated. Renal
and Cardiology were consulted re: BP management. On [**8-20**] an TTE
was performed demonstrating moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] pulmonary
HTN. At this time the patient also began to go into AF with RVR
requiring a sotalol drip for rate control. She was eventually
loaded with Amiodarone and her AF stopped. This was immediately
discontinued for concern of prolonged QTC associated here
additional psychiatric medications. After several weeks of
attempting BP control with high doses of multiple medications
including metoprolol, clonidine, hydralazine, nitro drips,
lobetalol - it became clear that the patient had systolic HTN
and afterload reduction had been maximally achieved. She
continued to have persistent, impressive pulmonary edema despite
this afterload reduction and substantial diuresis, attributed to
severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 101310**] with likely stiff aorta. This was not a
[**Last Name (Titles) **] issue or an afterload reduction issue.  The patient
continued to have desaturations and was placed back on BIPAP
with improved saturations.  Geriatrics was also consulted and
nightly seroquel was started for delerium and agitation with
substantial improvements. After long discussions with family and
patient, the decision was made for DNR/DNI and then CMO as
medical therapy had largely been exhausted. Patient began
morphine / dilaudid regimine for palliation to reduce air
hunger. Hospice was consulted and patient was transitioned to
the floor.  Arrangements were made for home hospice care.

While on the medicine floor, the goals have been comfort
measures. We are no longer checking regular vitals and getting
labs. Her HTN medicine regimen was weaned to a Clonidine and
Nitroglycerin patches, with IV Hydralazine in case she had flash
pulmonary edema. She was taking PO Morphine elixir and Seroquel,
Sertraline, and Ativan pills crushed and put into liquids,
although she was not taking many.  She has been comfortable on
nasal cannula oxygen and has not used BiPAP in over a week.  She
has been taking minimal soft solid po when with family.
Symptoms to shortness of breath seem to be well controlled on
the current regimen.  She has been complaining of itching likely
due to worsening uremia and we have provided benadryl and sarna
lotion for relief.  If she develops new symptoms that are
uncomfortable to her, please call her PCP to assist with
additional medications for symptom relief.
