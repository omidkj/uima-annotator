INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Lipomatous hypertrophy of the
interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild
regional LV
systolic dysfunction. Low normal LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal inferior
- hypo; mid inferior - hypo; inferior apex - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in ascending
aorta. Normal
aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderate-severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**2-5**]+)
AR. Eccentric AR jet directed toward the anterior mitral
leaflet.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Physiologic MR
(within normal limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
Pre Bypass: Image quality is poor overall. The left atrium is
mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild to moderate inferior
wall
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is focal
calcifcation
of the aortic root. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated
but poorly seen,
with measurements ranging from 3.7-4.5 cm-- recommend
correlation with CT and
clinical findings. There appear to be simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta,
but image quality is poor here.. There is complex atheroma in
the aortic arch
and the descending aorta. There is moderate to severe aortic
valve stenosis
(area averages 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**2-5**]+) aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward
the anterior
mitral leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).

Post Bypass: Patient is on epinepherine infusion a
