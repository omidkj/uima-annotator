Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21007**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid
bleeding, presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately
one week. She notes that she felt some left chest cramping last
week; however, the pain did not become severe until [**2173-11-26**].
Pain initially radiated to back and now is going down to her
left buttocks. This is in background of ~2 months of dyspnea on
exertion which has noticably worsened in last two weeks. Also
patient is reporting that she had sudden onset BLE edema that
she first noticed after a plane trip to St. [**Doctor First Name **] (4 hour leg to
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 8880**] [**Country **] was longest time on plane). She denies any LE edema
at this time. Also denies cough, hemoptysis, fevers, chills,
sick contacts.
.
Regarding her uterine fibroid bleeding, patient is seen in
OB/Gyn by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She notes that her last menstral period
(and start of her abnormal uterine bleeding) was [**2173-9-27**].
Patient took a high dose OCP taper starting [**2173-10-22**] for large
uterine fibroids that were causing significant uterine bleeding.
At time of admission she was taking one pill daily, though she
had been instructed to start another high dose OCP taper due to
increased vaginal bleeding in the last 4 to 5 days. She did not
take the high dose OCPs due to not feeling well in the last few
days. She had planned for an open myommectomy on [**2174-1-12**] due
to persistent bleeding. As a bridge to surgery, patient was
going to receive information about a Lupron injection this week.
She explicitly denies any history of pregnancy, abortions, or
miscarriages.
.
Upon presentation to the ED vitals were T 98.8, HR 96, BP
138/83, RR 16, O2Sats 100% RA. Presented with chest pain. Was
found to have elevated d-dimer to ~[**Numeric Identifier 7206**] and subsequently found
to have extensive bilateral PE on CTA chest. Was started on a
heparin drip. EKG was without wigns of right heart strain.
Troponin was negative at <0.01. Was originally destined for the
floor, though the floor attending was concerned about full
anticoagulation in the setting of recent uterine bleeding. Needs
to be typed, crossed, and consented for blood products in the
event of uterine bleeding while anticoagulated. Vitals prior to
transfer to the ICU were T 98.4, HR 92, BP 119, RR 28, 100%/4L
NC.

Studies:

[**2173-11-28**] CT Chest with and without contrast
There are multiple filling defects in the bilateral pulmonary
arteries supplying the right upper lobe, anterior segment (2,
23) and right lower lobe (2, 31-40). There is a nodular
subpleural opacity within the periphery of the right lower lobe
(2, 40) which may represent a small pulmonary infarct. Filling
defects within the left upper lobe segmental arteries (2, 19),
lingula (2, 24), and left lower lobe (2, 36) segmental arteries
are also identified. There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a
small left pleural effusion. There is no evidence of bowing of
the interventricular septum to suggest right heart failure at
this time. Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
identified.  IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli as
described above.  Possible right lower lobe pulmonary infarct.

[**2173-11-29**] Transthoracic Echo
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2173-11-29**] Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either lower extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid
bleeding who presented with pleuritic chest pain for
approximately one week and was diagnosed with pulmonary emboli.

#VB: She had increased bleeding in the 4 to 5 days leading up to
presentation to the hospital.  She was started on Lupron to
minimize uterine bleeding on [**11-28**].  Her bleeding worsened after
being placed on a heparin gtt for PE, and in the setting of
acute Lupron injection but and she was followed closely by the
gynecology service while in the ICU.  She was transfused 1U
overnight from [**Date range (1) 52935**] and her Hct responded appropriately.
Given her continued bleeding, myomectomy and uterine artery
embolization were considered, however after discussion with the
gynecology team, decided that as long as Hct was responding, we
should wait for Lupron to work.  Hct was 27.2 upon transfer out
of the ICU.

#Anemia: On Hospital Day #4 ([**12-1**]), Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred
out of the Intensive Care Unit. On HD#6, her hematocrit trended
down to 25 and she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood
cells as the goal was to keep her hematrocrit >25. Her
hematocrit showed an appropriate rise to 29.9 and it remained
stable after that time and she did not require any additional
blood products.

#Tachycardia: Throughout the first 10 days of her hospital
course she was tachycardic to 140s with ambulation. This
eventually subsided and she remained in regular rate. Telemetry
did not demonstrate any arrythmia. the tachycardia was
attributed to the pulmonary embolism.

#PE: She was continued on the Heparin gtt until
