History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 36 year old female with history of recently
diagnosed ALL, who came to the oncology clinic to receive her
chemothrapy and complained of worsening shortness of breath and
chest pain for a few days, and was referred to ED for further
evaluation and treatment. Per patient, she has been experiencing
worsening dyspnea for the past week when she had to increase the
number of pillows from 2 to 4 due to shortness of breath when
she slept.  States a [**6-14**] midsternal chest pain that radiates
circumferentialy around the ribs to the back that started a few
days ago. Pain is gradual and constant and worse with
inspiration, gets better when she is sits up.  Has a productive
cough with white/clear phelegm.  Denies any fevers/chills/night
sweats.
.
She has also been experiencing severe nausea and vomiting for
the past week where she has been unable to hold any food down.
Her weight has been fluctuating but no big weight loss recently.
She does endorse dizziness since yesterday when she stands up,
relieved when she sits or lies down.
.
With her hx of asthma, she only uses her inhalers. Has not been
to the ED for any exacerbations. States an increased frequency
of use of her inhalers in the past few weeks.
.
Of note, patient recently presented to ED on [**2172-8-11**] with some
RUE weaknesa and parethesia, and was found to have a WBC of
140K, and emergently leukopheresed, and was diagnosed with ALL.
She was discharged on [**2172-9-22**], and has been receiving
chemotherapy regularly. Today is her phase II day 25 therapy.
.
In the ED, patient's initial vitals were: Afebrile, T98.2 BP
154/120 HR 138 RR 18 SPO297% on R/A. Sat's: off oxygen 93%, 97%
on 4L (depends on position). She was slightly tachypneic, RR
25-30s, and it hurts for her to breath in.  She underwent CTA to
rule out PE. Her scan demonstrated large bilateral pleural
effusions and a small pericardial effusion. bedside US showed no
tamponade, and small effusion. She was given 1 gram of Cefepime,
500-1000cc of normal saline, had 200cc urine (no foley). No
change in HR was seen after receiving morphine or IVF. The
oncology fellow was notified of the patient's planned admission
and course. per onc fellow, no urgent need to tap, but may need
to tap overnight if pt is very symptomatic from the pleural
effusion.
.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
On the floor, she continued to complain of shortness of breath
while lying down, and is sitting up while talking. She continued
to complain of nausea.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied any palpitations. Denied diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria.

IMAGING:
- CXR ([**2172-10-15**])
IMPRESSION: New interstitial edema and moderate bilateral
pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
.
- TTE [**2172-10-16**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = XX %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-8-12**],
global biventricular systolic dysfunction is new. The
pericardial effusion is new.
.
- CTA report [**2172-10-15**]: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of
pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or
pneumothorax. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber.

There are bilateral moderate new pleural effusions with adjacent
atelectasis
in the lower lobes bilaterally. There are scattered noncalcified
pulmonary
nodules, which are new compared to the recent prior study of
[**9-19**]. Small-
to-moderate pericardial effusion is present. There is diffuse
interstitial
septal thickening, compatible with edema. The airways are patent
to the
subsegmental levels bilaterally. There is no hilar, mediastinal
or axillary adenopathy.

This study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.
Known liver mass in segment VI is not imaged on this study.

IMPRESSION:
1. New large bilateral pleural effusions, small-to-moderate
pericardial
effusion, and interstitial septal thickening, compatible with
edema.

2. Bilateral noncalcified pulmonary nodules. Short interval
development
since the prior study favors infectious/inflammatory etiology,
progression of
the disease less likely.

.
EKG on admission ([**2172-10-15**]):
rate 127, sinus rhythm. normal axis. pr, qrs and qt intervals
within normal range. low amplitude qrs in limb leads. t wave
flattening in limb leads.  less than 0.5mm ST depression in V5,
V6.
.
ECHO [**2172-10-16**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = XX %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular cha
