Allergies:
Ace Inhibitors

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of CHF (EF 25% in [**3-1**]) presents
with shortness of breath and mild chest tightness for 3-4 hours
at her nursing home on the morning of admission and was sent to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation. She describes her pain as a
pressure and SOB w/ exertion, similar to her previous episodes
of CHF. After her recent discharge, she was increased from 40mg
to 60mg Lasix [**Hospital1 **]. At baseline, she used 2L of O2 and a few
pillows when she sleeps at night.  She does not wake up in the
middle of the night short of breath.

Prior to her arrival to the ED, she received ASA and NS 250cc by
EMS.
In the ED, she was found to be in a fib with HR 130's, without
any prior history. She continued to be tachycardic and her BP
improved from as low as 90/52 with 500cc NS bolus. She was
satting 95% on 4L and her CXR showed bilateral pulmonary edema.
She received 40mg IV lasix and her HR came down to the 120s.
Despite her stable transfer vitals (BP 114/85, HR 113 and
decreased O2 requirement of 2L and satting O2 99%), the floor
felt she was too unstable and she was admitted to the ICU.
.
She was previously discharged on [**2182-12-30**] after a 3-day long stay
for a CHF exacerbation.  At that time, the patient's daughter
was [**Name (NI) 653**] to clarify her medical history.  Over the past
year, her mother has visited the hospital for at least 3 times
because of exacerbations.
The patient also has a previous history of anxiety and these
exacerbations make her very anxious and disoriented.  At
baseline, the patient uses a hearing aid and needs it to
understand what is being told; otherwise she becomes even more
anxious.
.
In the ICU, the patient is quite comfortable, in continued
atrial fibrillation, on 2L O2.  She is complaining of a mild
"tightness" between her shoulder blades.
.

.
Micro:
Blood culture: No growth.
.
EKG: atrial fibrillation, LBBB, TWI in I, II, aVL, V4-V6 (apart
from irregular rhyth, no changes from previous)
.
Imaging/studies:
.
CXR - worsening vascular congestion reflective of pulmonary
edema with cardiomegaly, poor inspiratory volumes.  Bilateral
pleural effusions.
.
TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis with visual dyssynchrony (LVEF =
25-30 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
function. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is suggested. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global
hypokinesis. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Increased PCWP.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] F with systolic CHF, anemia, ITP admitted with shortness of
breath, found to have new onset a fib and acute on chronic
systolic CHF exacerbation.
.
CHF exacerbation.  CXR remarkable for pulmonary edema and
bilateral pleural effusions. The likely precipitant was new
atrial fibrillation.  BNP of >12,000.  No EKG changes reflective
of ischemia and mild troponin leak was not felt consistent with
acute ischemia. The patient received IV diuresis in the ICU.
Echo confirmed severely depressed EF and global hypokinesis. She
was transitioned to oral lasix at previous home dose and was
started on spironolactone. She diuresed well and is now back on
her home PRN 2L NC oxygen without any symptomatic shortness of
breath. The patient will continue on lasix and spironolactone
therapy. The patient must have daily weights and a low salt
diet. She will continue beta-blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] therapy.
.
Atrial fibrillation. The patient presented in new A Fib. She had
a small troponin leak without EKG changes and this was felt not
consistent with ischemia. She had a normal TSH. Anticoagulation
would be recommended based upon her CHADS-2 score however after
discussion with her PCP by the previous hospitalist, she was
felt to be a high risk candidate based upon age and ITP history
and will not be started on anticoagulation. She is on aspirin
therapy. The patient required uptitration and achived good rate
control on both metoprolol and diltiazem and she will leave on
these medications. She was taken off of her home carvedilol
after initiation of metoprolol for rate control.
.
The patient did have a slight increase in Cr to 1.3 where it was
stable for several days prior to discharge after starting
spironolactone and restarting her home [**Last Name (un) **]. She also has chronic
anemia (with normal B12, folate and iron studies). She requires
repeat blood work in 5 days to monitor renal function and
hematocrit.
.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] medical issues are stable.
