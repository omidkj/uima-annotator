Brief Hospital Course:
Goals of Care: During this hospitalization there were extensive
conversations about goals of care.  The patient, her family,
Palliative Care, the ICU and floor teams, her outpatient
doctors, Farsi interpreters and social work were involved to try
to clarify what was in her best interest.  The overall result
was a decision to focus on care measures.  Pt and her family are
interested in palliative/hospice care after leaving the
hospital.  Pt written for comfort medications, including
morphine, hyoscyamine, tylenol, lopressor.

Hypoxia: DDx pulm edema [**1-4**] AF, PNA, PE, worsening pleural
effusion. Cardiogeneic pulm edema possible, altho small CAD hx.
Now stable on [**1-6**] L oxygen. PE most likely diagnosis given h/o
dvts and malignancy.
- did not tap pleural effusion as pt not in distress; likely
secondary to CHF, vol overload and possibly malignant
.
Hypotension: persisted throughout stay, started midodrine with
some benefit, still giving metoprolol despite bp in 80's for
tachycardia in 140s.
.
ESRD: Pt ultimately unable to tolerate HD because of
hypotension.  Pt also desired stopping.  Last HD was [**7-2**].
.
DM2: diet controlled at home, FS qid and ss insulin while in
ICU, FSs were discontinued on the floor per patient and family
request.
.
AF: While in the ICU pt was rate controlled on dilt.  After
transfer to floor and stopping HD it was changed to lopressor
for rate control.
.
DVT/LE ulcers/thrombolphelitis/left atrial thrombus: cont
coumadin empirically at 0.5mg QHS (no blood work). situation
worse with chronic venous stasis and DVT, cont dressing changes.

.
Pancreatic cancer/mass; vague abd pain, treated pain with
morphine; family decided not to work up pancreatic cancer.
.
Guiac + stool: hct at pt's baseline, will monitor; likely no
major intervention given pts goals of care
.
UTI: Pt was treated with ceftriaxone for e.coli while on HD.
E.coli is not sensitive to any PO abx and pt is asymptomatic at
discharge.
.
FEN: diet as tolerated.
