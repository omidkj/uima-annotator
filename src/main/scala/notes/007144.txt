Date of Birth:   [**2115-8-6**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Decreased blood pressure and decreased
hematocrit, post renal artery stent.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease and
peripheral vascular disease, status post left artery stent,
here for nausea and lightheadedness which began the morning
after the stent was placed when the patient got up out of bed
to go to the bathroom.  She experienced no chest pain or
shortness of breath.  Her hematocrit was found to be 28.5 on
[**2183-10-2**] and her hematocrit on [**2183-10-8**] was 22.  Her
creatinine at this time was 1.6 which was down from 1.9.  The
patient had received verapamil 120 mg the morning of her
lightheadedness, but had received no other blood pressure
medication.  With dopamine drip begun at 15 mcg/kg, the
patient had a heart rate of 78 and blood pressure of 94/31.
One unit of blood was given to her on the floor and another
unit was subsequently transfused in the CCU to raise her
blood pressure and improve her hematocrit.  The patient also
received iron shots every week secondary to a history of
anemia.  Her last transfusion was approximately one year ago
with an unknown source of bleeding.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease.  In [**2170**], the patient had a right coronary artery
PTCA with a right dominant system.  In [**2178**], she had a right
coronary artery stent with a PTCA of D1.  In [**2180**], she had a
mid-RCA ISR treated with PTCA.  On [**2183-4-3**], she had an 80%
mid-RCA which was PTCA'd and stented.  On [**2183-8-12**], she had
catheterization for dyspnea and CHF which showed left main
disease 30% ostial, LAD 30-40% lesion proximally, a D1 ostial
40%, circumflex proximally occluded, right CA with mildly
patent stents, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, and an
ejection fraction of 75% with trace MR, and severe LV
diastolic dysfunction.  On [**2183-9-17**], she had an MRA which
showed reduction of size and perfusion of the left kidney and
evidence of right artery stenosis.  Her echo showed LVEF of
50-80% with normal wall motion and normal mitral and aortic
valves.

The patient also has a history of peripheral vascular
disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, anemia, history
of GI bleed with sigmoid colectomy, coronary artery disease,
status post left carotid stenosis, history of depression,
history of renal artery stenosis and chronic renal
insufficiency.

2 tbsp po bid, iron shots q week, Flovent 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **],
Serevent 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **], albuterol 2 puffs IH q 4-6.

ALLERGIES:  Include aspirin at a higher dose of 325, codeine,
percocet, beta blockers which lead to bronchospasm, shellfish
and dye.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a widow who lives alone.  She
has several children in the area and is followed by [**Hospital3 **] VNA multiple times per week.  She used to smoke two
packs per day for approximately 50 years and quit in [**Month (only) 216**]
of this year.  She drinks socially for six to seven years and
stopped a few years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs included a blood
pressure of 104/50 not on any drips and a heart rate of 72
upon admission to the CCU.  General appearance -
well-appearing, pale, obese female, talking and alert.  HEENT
- moist mucous membranes.  Neck exam - no JVD, some obesity.
In the right carotid there was a scar present but no bruits.
Cardiac - regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Pulmonary - bilaterally clear to auscultation.
Abdomen - positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, obese, no
periumbilical bruising, no flank ecchymoses.  Extremities -
no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm extremities, palpable DP
and PT bilaterally.  Bilateral femoral bruits, right greater
than left with no hematoma and twitching of both lower
extremities given history of restless leg syndrome.

LABS:  That morning she ruled out x 3 for an MI.  She also
had a hematocrit of 22.1, K 4.4, BUN 48, creatinine 1.6.  She
had an EKG done which showed normal sinus rhythm at [**Street Address(2) 99881**] elevations in I and AVL, left axis deviation, but no
criteria for LVH and no other changes.  The patient had a CT
of the abdomen and pelvis done to rule out an acute bleed
which showed minimal atelectasis and no pulmonary nodules,
normal liver, pancreas, spleen, kidney.  There was a renal
stone in the right kidney pelvis, but otherwise no signs of
retroperitoneal bleeding.  No signs of hydronephrosis.  No
pelvic free air or fluid, and otherwise unremarkable CT of
abdomen and pelvis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the above, the patient was hydrated
and her hypotension was thought to be secondary to the
verapamil she received the morning she was transferred to the
CCU.  She was given two units of blood with improvement in
her hematocrit.  A rectal exam was performed which showed
that she was guaiac negative, and with this chronic history
of anemia which subsequently stabilized, the patient was
deemed stable for discharge.

She was discharged to home and will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
in one week's time, and follow-up with her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
given copies of her catheterization report, and she was
continued all of her previous medications except lasix,
hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and her Imdur dose was
halved to 30 mg po qd.  The other medications would be
restarted by her PCP as her blood pressure was monitored.
The patient was discharged in stable condition.
