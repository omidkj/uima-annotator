Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Seroquel / Fentanyl / Flagyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2146-11-7**] - Cardiac catheterization
[**2146-11-11**] - Coronary artery bypass grafting x4: With the left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery,
the first and second obtuse marginal artery.


History of Present Illness:
Of note, pt is a poor historian. 68 y/o M with PMHx significant
for h/o atrial fibrillation, COPD, HTN, PVD, HLD, liver disease,
and ? h/o PE, who presented to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with chest
pain and shortness of breath. Pt reports that he was initially
diagnosed with a PE approximately 2.5 months ago at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. He had been on coumadin; however, he reports that his
coumadin had been stopped a few weeks ago for unclear reasons
(with plans to restart soon). Pt reports that when his visiting
nurse was at his house today, he reported some chest pain and
shortness of breath. Describes chest pain as pressure-like and
located in the left chest. It was associated with shortness of
breath and lightheadedness but no diaphoresis or nausea. It
lasted approximately 15 seconds. Pt reports similar episodes
over the past several months ever since he was diagnosed with
the PE. Each episode lasts anyhwere from 5 seconds to several
minutes. The visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) 12690**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and the patient was
brought to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for further evaluation.
.
In the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the patient underwent a CT chest which
showed a stable PE in the RLL. There was some concern regarding
anticoagulation in this patient because he had a previous
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**8-30**] that was complicated by GI
bleeding. Therefore, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management of his anticoagulation. On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED,
the patient's VS were 96.8; 144/90; 106; 16; 99% on 4L. He was
guaiac negative. He was started on lovenox for anticoagulation
and received his first dose (90 mg SC) at 00:00 on [**2146-11-5**]. Lab
wokr in the ED was significant for a sodium of 132 and a
negative set of CEs. No further imaging was performed. ECG was
not significant changed from prior. He was admitted for further
evaluataion. VS prior to transfer: 126/83 99 19 96%2L.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient's VS were T 97.9; BP
122/83; HR 100; RR 20; SaO2 100% on 2L. He denied any current
chest pain or shortness of breath. He denied any other
complaints at this time. Of note, pt did report some LLE pain
(calf and shin) recently that has since resolved.
.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI. The patient also reported some chronic R-sided
weakness. He also complained of recent episodes of epistaxis.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight changes.
Denies rhinorrhea, or nasal congestion. Denies cough,
palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
abdominal pain. Denies change in bladder habits, dysuria. Denies
arthralgias or myalgias.

Carotid Ultrasound [**2146-11-10**]
Findings are consistent with less than 40% stenosis bilaterally.

RUQ ULTRASOUND ([**2146-11-8**])-
1. Mild dilatation of the extrahepatic common duct and of the
pancreatic duct. This diatation is of unknown etiology. The
pancreatic duct is noted to be also dilated, but smaller than on
the CT of [**2146-8-21**]. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation noted.

2. Ectatic aorta measuring up to 2.8 cm at the widest diameter.
3. Small non obstructing stone in the left kidney.

CARDIAC CATH ([**2146-11-7**]) -
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated left main and two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA
had a 60% stenosis in the distal vessel.  There was an 80%
ostial LAD
stenosis.  The LCx had a 40% stenosis at the origin.  The RCA
was
calcified with a 90% stenosis in the mid-vessel.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 10 mmHg and LVEDP 14 mmHg.  There was high
normal
pulmonary arterial systolic pressure with PASP 32mmHg.  The
cardiac
index was preserved at 2.47 l/min/m2.  There was normotension of
the
systemic arterial pressure 134/79 mmHg.
3. There was no evidence of gradient on careful pullback of the
angled
pigtail catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.

4. Left ventriculography was deferred.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 63108**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2146-11-5**] for further
management of his chest pain. Heparin was continued for
anticoagulation given his history of atrial fibrillation and
pulmonary embolism. He r/o for MI, but underwent cath which
