Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Clindamycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea at OSH, now intubated

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy
chest tube placement and removal
pigtail catheter placement and removal

History of Present Illness:
32 M w/ h/o HIV, IV drug use, ETOH, initially admitted to SICU
from OSH due to empyema.  The patient presented on [**7-3**] for
chest pain and shortness of breath and was admitted to the
medical service there where he was discovered to have positive
blood cxs (GPCs). He was started on IV Abx but continued to
clinically worsen. During his hospital course at [**Hospital1 1562**] he
developed persistent fevers, sepsis, and MODS. He was intubated
on HD1. Bilat CT's were placed on [**7-13**] [**1-20**] a concern for right
sided endocarditis and bilateral pleural effusions. Additionally
he has had both TTE and TEE that have been negative for evidence
of endocarditis at [**Hospital1 1562**]. The patient was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Prior to his transfer from
[**Hospital1 **], both of his chest tubes were removed.

On the floor, the patient is hemodynamically stable, but avoids
eye contact and is dismissive of the physical exam.  Vitals are
99.6, 125/63, 85, 22 and 97% on 3L.

IMAGING
.
Chest CT scan [**2105-7-13**] - OSH read
Impression: 3 x 3 cm anterior LUL loculated effusion, 3 x 5 cm
posterior ring enhancing lesion suspicious for empyema. Multiple
smaller right lobe efusions; LUL 9x8mm cavitary lesion, lingual
14-16mm fluid collection, R apex 17x16mm oval cavitary lesion
.
Abdominal CT scan OSH [**2105-7-13**]
Periportal edema, small amount of ascites, extensive
lymphadenopathy in the periceliac, periportal and periaortic
regions
.
Chest x-rays:
[**7-14**] - IMPRESSION: Mild improvement of left lower lobe
atelectasis and left pleural effusion. Multiple bilateral
circular opacities, some with cavitation, consistent with septic
emboli remain unchanged.
[**7-15**], s/p right pigtail catheter placement - IMPRESSION: Right
pleural effusion has decreased. Improvement in left lower lobe
atelectasis with better aeration of the lung.
[**7-16**] - Of note, the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax was
not included on this
film, the evaluation of the right pleural effusion is limited.
Right basal
pigtail catheter remains in place. Cardiac size is top normal.
The
mediastinum is widened as before due to mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. Multiple lung nodules and masses, some with
cavitations, are unchanged. Left lower lobe opacity has
increased. It could be due to increasing pleural effusion and
atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be totally
excluded. There is no evident pneumothorax. Left PICC tip is in
the SVC.
[**7-19**] -PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right upper extremity
PICC remains in
place. A right pleural pigtail catheter has been removed. There
is no new
pneumothorax. Small right and likely left pleural effusions
remain. Multiple
peripheral nodular and mass-like areas of consolidation are also
as previously
seen. No new consolidation or pulmonary edema is noted.
Cardiomediastinal
contours remain normal.
IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax after removal of right pleural
drain.
.
TTE ([**2105-7-15**]):
IMPRESSION: No vegetation or pathologic flow identified. Normal
biventricular systolic function.
.
CT chest ([**2105-7-17**]):
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Multiple peripheral, nodular, and mass-like areas of
consolidation in both lungs are compatible with septic emboli.
While lesions in the right lower lobe are newly apparent due to
reexpansion of the right lower lobe, no other new or enlarging
lesion is seen. Some lesions have decreased in size. Some show
new cavitation while others previously shown to have cavitation
no longer have apparent cavitation.
2. Bilateral small complex loculated pleural effusions with
enhancing rind,
smaller on the right since [**2105-7-13**]. Adjacent relaxation
atelectasis involves nearly the complete left lower lobe, with
sparing of the anterior segments only. Dependent atelectasis
also in the right lung. Minimal right
pneumothorax, with pleural catheter in place.
3. Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy.
.
Teeth panorex ([**2105-7-19**]): tooth #2 bone loss and radiolucency, #7
previously started root canal, radiolucency


Brief Hospital Course:
**For outside hospital course at [**Hospital1 1562**], please see HPI**

# MSSA bacteremia and ?right-sided endocarditis with pulmonary
septic emboli: Blood cultures grossly positive at OSH for
Gram-positive cocci, sensitive to Oxacillin, Levaquin, and Gent;
resistant to PCN, erythromycin. CT findings were suggestive of
pulmonary septic emboli with cavitation. TTE and TEE was neg and
no new murmurs.  No splinter hemorrhages, [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions, or
Osler nodes on exam.  Dental team ordered a panorex which showed
non-active abscesses in one ante
