Pertinent Results:
Echo [**5-12**]: The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional
wall motion abnormalities include basal to mid
inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Cardiac Cath [**5-15**]: Selective coronary angiography revealed left
main coronary artery disease. The LMCA had an 80% ostial
stenosis. The LAD had a 40% stenosis proximally. The remainder
of the LAD and diagonal branches were without flow limiting
disease. The LCX and OM branches were without flow limiting
disease. The RCA was a dominant vessel without flow limiting
disease. Resting hemodynamics from right heart catheterization
revealed normal right and left heart filling pressures
(RVEDP=6mmHg and mean PCWP=5mmHg). Cardiac output and index were
4.0 L/min and 2.3L/min/m2 respectively. Moderate systemic
arterial hypertension.
CT [**5-16**]: Moderate cardiomegaly. Dilation of the ascending aorta
to 4.2 cm without focal aneurysm. 4.3-cm infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm. Eight-mm right lung base pulmonary nodule.
Small but functioning right kidney with mild dilatation of the
calices and pelvis. The right ureter is not opacified, but there
is no evidence of stones or mass. Unremarkable left kidney. No
cause for patient's hematuria identified. Degenerative changes
of the spine, including Grade I anterolisthesis of L4 over L5
and chronic disc space narrowing at T12-L1 and L5-S1.
