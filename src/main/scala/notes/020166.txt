History of Present Illness:
61 year old female with a history of HTN, dyslipidemia, and a
strong family history of CAD(The patient's twin sister died at
age 58 from an MI). She underwent a stress test shortly after
her sister's death which she was told was
normal. During a routine physical this year in [**Month (only) 958**], the
patient was found to have an abnormal EKG and was sent for
stress testing which was positive. The results were never
relayed to her, so she presumed they were normal. Pt was told
recently that the results were in fact abnormal and pt presented
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] for a second opinion and she was referred for
cath at that point. Now
asked to evaluate for surgical revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2183-7-31**] Cardiac cath: 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system revealed two vessel coronary artery disease. The
LMCA was without angiographically apparent stenosis. The LAD had
a 95% complex lesion in the mid vessel at the take off of D1,
which was had an early bifrication and ostial 95% stenoses in
its upper and lower poles. The LCx was totally occluded
proximally. The RCA had no angiographically apparent stenoses.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial systolic and diastolic pressures with an SBP of 110
mmHg and a DBP of 58 mmHg.
[**2183-8-1**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral and inferior
wall moderate to severe hypokinesis. (LVEF= 30-35 %). The
remaining left ventricular segments contract normally. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST CPB: 1. Mildly improved focal V function with improved wall
motion. 2. Perserved RV systolic function. 3. Moderate eccentric
MR jet(posteriorly directed) immediately after separation from
CPB. It improved to mild intensity over the next few minutes. 4.

Brief Hospital Course:
Presented and underwent a cardiac catherization and was found to
have severe two-vessel coronary artery disease. She was admitted
and underwent pre-operative work-up for cardiac surgery. On [**8-1**]
she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft. Please see operative report for
surgical details. She received cefazolin for perioperative
antibiotics.  Postoperatively she was transferred to the
intensive care unit for hemodynamic management.  In the first
twenty four hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.
Postoperative day one she was transfer to the floor and started
on diuretic and betablockers.  She continued to progress,
physical therapy worked with her on strength and mobility.  She
did well except for issues with nausea, was noted for gastric
air on chest xray and improved with simethicone.  She was ready
for discharge home on postoperative day four with services.
