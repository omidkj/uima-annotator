Physical Exam:
On admission...

General: Intubated and sedated.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pupils reactive but minimally so
(3.5->3). No nystagmus. ETT and NGT in place. MMM.
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation anterolaterally
CV: Tachycardic, regular, S1 S2, soft SM at LUSB
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema. Healed scars on upper extremities from past cutting.
Neuro: Sedation limiting exam. Currently nonresponsive to all
stimuli, does not withdraw to pain. No clonus. Tone normal

Pertinent Results:
CXR 1V ([**2127-10-16**]):  AP single view of the chest has been obtained
with patient in upright position. The heart size is normal.
Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable. No signs of acute
infiltrate and the lateral pleural sinuses are free. No evidence
of pneumothorax. When comparison is made with the next previous
chest examination of [**2127-10-13**], the patient has been
extubated. The previously identified bilateral pulmonary
parenchymal densities that existed at that time when the patient
was taking care of for status post overdose intoxication, have
cleared up completely and the findings now are within normal
limits.

EKG ([**2127-10-16**]):  Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing
precordial T waves improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
19 year-old male with bipolar disorder vs. schizoaffective
disorder admitted [**2127-10-10**] following suicide attempt by clozaril
overdose. At outside hospital prior to transfer, patient was
also noted to have tonic-clonic seizure. Hospital course was as
follows.

1. Overdose.  Suicidal gesture. Clozaril overdose. Tox screen
negative. Also with lithium in past, though level negative.
Toxicology was consulted, and did not feel that the patient's
clinical exam was consistent with NMS or serotonin syndrome (no
clonus, rigidity). He was placed on bicarb gtt, and serial ECG's
after bicarb was stopped were stable. Patient initially endorsed
suicidal ideation after extubation. He was placed on 1:1
observation. He was given haldol for PRN agitation while
monitoring for QTc prolongation. Psych meds were still being
held upon transfer from the MICU.

2. Seizure. In setting of overdose, fever, and leukocytosis.
Likely overdose related. No prior seizure history. LP, culture
data, and HSV PCR were without indication of meningitis.

3. Aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.  Febrile to 102F with
infiltrates on CXR, bands on diff. Likely related to altered
mental status/somnolence due to overdose. Likely due to
aspiration.  Bronchoscopy showed erythema without evidence of
active infection. BAL showed 1+ PMNs, and was without active
growth (although patient was on antibiotics prior to
broncoscopy). Unasyn was discontinued due to rash. Patient was
started on levaquin for aspiration pneumonia coverage.

On transfer to the medical floor, patient continued to do well.
He completed a 5-day course of levofloxacin for aspiration
pneumonia. He did not have recurrence of fevers. Given his
asthma history and wheezing on exam, he was started on
fluticasone standing and albuterol inhaler as needed. He was
noted to have hematuria. Urology was consulted given pain with
urination and hematuria, and felt that this was due to Foley
trauma. Patient should ensure good oral hydration. Pyridium was
started for short course. If patient continues to have visible
blood in urine on [**2127-10-22**], he should contact urology for further
follow-up. If bleeding persists on [**2127-10-21**], please call [**Hospital1 18**]
urology for follow-up appointment at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10797**]. Psychiatry
followed the patient closely. He was not started on any
psychiatric medications during the hospital course.
