IMAGING
-[**5-28**] PELVIS XR:
FINDINGS:
No acute fracture or dislocation is present.  Diffuse
demineralization of the osseous structures is noted.  There is
no diastasis of the pubic symphysis or sacroiliac joints.  No
suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormalities are seen.
Scattered phleboliths are seen within the left hemipelvis.
There are surgical clips noted pelvis.  There are mild
degenerative changes with joint space narrowing of the hips.
IMPRESSION:
No acute fracture or dislocation.
.
5/31 L-spine XR
IMPRESSION:
No acute fracture or subluxation.
.
[**5-28**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Mild pulmonary edema, with continued bilateral pleural
effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right. Fluid is
noted to track over the apices bilaterally.  Left basilar
opacification may reflect compressive atelectasis though
infection is difficult to exclude.
.
[**5-28**] C-spine w/ contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No fracture or change in alignment.
2.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**5-28**] Head CT:
FINDINGS:  There is no acute hemorrhage, edema, or shift of
normally midline structures.  Prominence of the ventricles and
sulci is compatible with age-
