History of Present Illness:
THis is a 52 year old spanish speaking (minimal history given
the decreased mental status and unable to reach family for
corroboration of contact) female w/ history of OSA on BIPAP at
home, restrictive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension,
cognitive impairment, CHF, was found down and unresponsive at
home.
She was in her usual state of health until 3 days pta when she
was not feeling well (per her family). Her family found her to
be lying in bed incoherent and febrile to 104.
She was recently admitted here on [**8-29**] for CHF/COPD and was
intubated in the MICU.

EEG: IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the slow and disorganized
background
and bursts of generalized slowing. These findings indicate a
widespread
encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and
subcortical
structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection
are
among the most common causes. No focal abnormalities were
evident, but
encephalopathies can obscure focal findings. There were no
epileptiform
features.

MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are no
abnormal areas of slow diffusion or susceptibility. The signal
intensities of the brain parenchyma are stable again
demonstrating minimal scattered white matter hyperintensities,
rarely significant as an isolated finding. There is no shift of
normally midline structures, mass effect or hydrocephalus. Note
is made of motion artifact limiting several sequences. There is
again note of a partially empty sella as described previously.
Normal vascular flow voids are present. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and osseous structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1.
No evidence of acute infarction. Stable appearance of the brain.

ECHO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color
Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers (but cannot exclude; views are
technically
suboptimal). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion

CT ABD: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of renal stones.
2. Allowing for limitations of study performed without IV oral
contrast, bowel appears grossly unremarkable. No evidence of
free air or free fluid within the abdomen.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old female, cognitive impairment, history of OSA and
COPD, pulm hypertension, found unresponsive on bed and febrile
and concerning for infection/dehydration and decreased mental
status of unclear etiology.

#Mental status changes
- Felt to be due to both hypotension and medication
non-compliance

Hypotension
- Felt to be be due to adrenal crisis and DI

Renal insuffiency
- felt to be ATN due to hypotension


OSA
-will put pt back on CPAP at nite

History of CHF-no evidence of CHF on admission CXR
-will monitor O2 sats, I/O, daily wts

Hypothyroid-continue on home dosage

hypernatremia
-2.6L free water deficit
Patient appeared to be hypovolemic. Also has history of central
DI and was to be on desmopression at home. This is likely in
setting of non-compliance with DDAVP. WIll try to given back
free water w/ D5 1/2 NS IVF.

Anemia-chronic anemia
- Last ferritin 26 in [**2-4**] was suggestive of iron defiency.
