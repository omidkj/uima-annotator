History of Present Illness:
Please see admission note for full details. In brief this a 56
year old female h/o ESRD on HD (MWF), DM2, who was admitted with
acute respiratory failure, s/p 2 PEA arrests in the ED and with
acute MI s/p DES X2. She was in her usual state of health until
monday morning [**2156-10-18**] when on her way to dialysis she had
acute onset dyspnea. EMS was called and transferred her to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED. She was noted to be hypoxic to the 60's. When she was laid
flat for intubation she had PEA arrest. CPR was initiated for 3
minutes and patient was given epi and calcium chloride, with
spontaneous return of circulation. She was given lasix and prior
to transfer to MICU, she became bradycardic and PEA arrested
again. CPR was initiated for 4 minutes and she was given Epi and
atropine. She then awoke and was following commands and
therefore cooling protocol was not performed. The patient was
planned for emergent dialysis however her RUE AVG was noted to
be thrombosed and therefore a temporary dialysis line had to be
placed. A left IJ line was attempted with difficulty and U/S
confirmed the presence of a left IJ clot. Also on [**2156-10-18**] EKG
was performed which was remarkable for atrial fibrillation,
ventricular rate 155bpm, STE in III, STD in V4-6. CKMB was
elevated up to peak of 86, troponin was also elevated and has
not yet peaked. Cardiology was consulted who recommended cardiac
catheterization. Proximal and mid LAD stenoses were noted and
were treated with DES x2. She was also started on heparin, given
ASA 325 and started on Atorvastatin, and plavix was continued
(home med). On [**2156-10-19**] (post cath), she was extubated and was
following commands. She was then transferred to the cardiology
service on [**2156-10-20**] for further management of acute MI.

Other Studies:
TTE [**2156-10-18**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the inferior wall and septum and distal
inferior dyskinesis. There is mild-moderate hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive
regional and global systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or
other diffuse process.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-12-25**],
the abnormalities are new and c/w interim ischemia/infarction.

TTE [**2156-10-22**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior akinesis and mid to distal
anteroseptal hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-10-18**],
left ventricular systolic function is now improved (particularly
anteroseptal and apical motion).

Admission CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube 5.5 cm above the carina in standard
position.
2. New moderately severe pulmonary edema.
3. Increased cardiomegaly, now moderately severe.
4. Stable foreign body (uncertain etiology) overlying the right
medial lung base.

[**10-18**] ECG: Probable sinus tachycardia with premature atrial
contractions. Anterolateral ST segment depressions which may be
due to ischemia. Possible ST segment elevation, one millimeter
in leads III and aVF. Cannot exclude ongoing inferior wall
myocardial infarction. Q wave in lead III and non-diagnostic Q
wave in leads aVF which may be due to prior inferior wall
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2156-8-27**] ST segment elevations in lead III and aVF are new.
