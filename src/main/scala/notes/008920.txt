CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and hypoxia after a
fall.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86-year-old woman who
fell at home around 8 AM stating she "lost her footing, it
was unwitnessed and was found sitting up.  She called out to
her daughter on their intercom at home who came to help her.
She was very lucid according to the daughter.  There was no
complaints after the fall, loss of consciousness or head
injury.  She fell on the left side and possibly hit her flank
and chest on her dresser.  After approximately 30 minutes
became increasingly shortness of breath associated with left
pleuritic chest pain and came to the Emergency Room.  Sats
were noted to be 75 to 80% with tachypnea, with increased
respiratory rate in the 40's.  The patient was intubated and
seen by the Trauma Team.  Had a left pleural effusion on
chest x-ray and trauma placed an apical left chest tube.

Also had a fever of 101.1 the previous night with nausea,
diaphoresis and episode of watery diarrhea without blood.
There is no vomiting.  The temperature decreased with Tylenol
and she did not note a fever this morning.

On [**12-27**] she noted a headache, nausea as well as feeling
chilled.

In the Emergency Room got a Atomadate 20 intravenous times
one, Succinyl choline one intravenous times one, Propofol for
sedation (blood pressure decreased on the Propofol) also
received Fentanyl 500 mg intravenous times five and 1 mg of
Versed.  Got Levaquin 500 mg intravenous times one, 2 liters
of normal saline in the Emergency Room and her vent was set
at assist control, 450x12 with 5 of PEEP and 100% FIO2.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her great grandchildren had a stomach
virus recently.  No chest pain, persistent cough without
sputum that was thought to be either congestive heart failure
or gastroesophageal reflux disease at her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] lower
extremity edema recently, no dysuria, abdominal pain.  Two
pillow orthopnea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.5, heart rate 96, blood
pressure 146/76 then 106/38, then an SPT in the 90's,
respiratory rate 36, O2 sat 100%

General:  Elderly woman sedated and intubated.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Eyes are taped shut.  Mucous
membranes are dry.  Neck:  Supple, flat jugular venous
distention.  CV:  Distant but regular rate and rhythm.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with
decreased breath sounds at the left base, left chest tube is
in place.  Abdomen: Normal active bowel sounds, soft,
nondistended, pulsatile abdominal mass.  Extremities:  warm
1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  No edema or clubbing.
Rectal:  Trace positive per surgery.  Normal tone.

DATA:  White blood count 5.6, hematocrit 33.3, platelets 130
with a differential of 13 polys, 0 bands and 60 lymphocytes.
135 sodium, potassium 4.4, chloride 95, bicarbonate 18, BUN
63, creatinine 2.2.  Glucose 76.  Anion gap of 22, a lactate
of 5.2.  EDG equals 7.3/40/134/20/-5.  A Urinalysis revealed
100 protein, trace ketones, small bili, no leukocytes or
nitrates.  3 to 5 red blood cells, 0 to 2 white blood cells,
0 to 2 epis.  No blood,many bacteria.

STUDIES:
1.  Electrocardiogram:  95 normal sinus rhythm, normal
intervals, normal axis.  UST depressions approximately 1 mm
in V4,V5 and V6.  T-wave inversions in V4, V5 and V6, 2, 3, L
(old) and a flat T-wave in F.

2.  Chest x-ray:  Endotracheal tube in good position with
normal heart size.  Left lower lobe opacity revealing either
consolidation or contusion with a small effusion.  Left chest
tube in place.  Healed right rib fractures and no
pneumothorax.

3.  Abdominal CT:  Per Surgery this was negative.  5.5 cm
abdominal aortic aneurysm which is old and no change from
[**2121-12-2**].  There is sludge in the gallbladder and
splenomegaly.

4.  Chest CT:  Large left pleural effusion, consolidation in
the left lower lobe.  Small left pneumothorax.  Chest tube
was tip at apex, emphysematous changes, calcified aorta and
carotid vessels.  Old healed rib fracture on the right.

5.  Head CT.  Negative for hemorrhage, shift or fractures.
Left frontal lobe with a prior infarct.

6.  Pelvis CT was negative.

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 86-year-old woman with a one day
history of fever, nausea, status post a fall this morning and
later presented with increased short of breath, O2
desaturations requiring intubation with a left lower lobe
pneumonia and effusion, status post a chest tube, and
metabolic acidosis with an elevated lactate likely secondary
to sepsis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Room blood pressure had
decreased to the 90's, however, this was attributed to recent
sedation and the patient was stable otherwise.  Within hours
of transfer to the floor the patient's blood pressure began
to drop and a Neo-Synephrine drip was started.  Pleural fluid
revealed an exudative effusion with a low glucose (2) likely
representing a parapneumonic effusion.  It was decided to
double cover with Levaquin and Ceftriaxone (she was
pre-medicated and we were to watch for possible rash or
allergic reaction.

Blood pressures continued to fall ultimately requiring four
pressors (Neo-Synephrine, Dopamine, Dobutamine, and
Vasopressor).  Also requiring continues fluid bolus and her
TH had decreased to 7.01 with a metabolic and respiratory
alkalosis with a lactate rising to 5.7.  Respiratory rate and
total volumes on the vent were increased in an attempt to
decrease her pACO2.  She began to brady done and at one point
her heart rate was in the 30's and then briefly in asystole
which responded to compressions, Epinephrine, Atropine and
bicarbonate.

Her Troponin returned at greater than 50 with negative CKs
and a repeat Electrocardiogram showed more pronounced ST
depression.

Cardiology was called and since there was no pericardial
effusion on CT it was felt that depressed blood pressures
were likely not cardiogenic however, she was obviously having
an acute myocardial infarction in the setting of sepsis.
Heparin was held since a chest tube was recently placed with
a plan to start it if she stabilized.  She did receive
aspirin.

Because of the patient's rapid deterioration the family was
called and came in.  After discussion it was decided to make
the patient DNR/DNI with a focus on comfort measures.
Aggressive support was discontinued and the family was at the
patient's bedside.  She passed away at approximately 5:10 AM
with cessation of heart rate, breathing and fixed dilated
pupils.  Since the patient died within 24 hours of admission
Medical Examiner was notified however, the case was waived.
