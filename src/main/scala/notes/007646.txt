History of Present Illness:
86M referred with a carcinoma of the rectum which was thought to
be partially obstructing, but in fact as it turns out, it was
his diverticulosis which was
giving him the partial obstruction. His family noted that he had
begun to fail over the past year and that he had some rectal
bleeding. Colonoscopy showed a lesion which was advertised as 16
cm, but in fact was 10 cm. He had previously
had an abdominal aortic aneurysm and 2 hernias repaired with
mesh which made things somewhat difficult.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**2114-5-15**] with T3N0 recti-sigmoid
adenocarcinoma. He was taken to the operating room on [**2114-5-17**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the surgical staff for a  Exploratory laparotomy,
lysis of adhesions (2.5 to 3 hours), low-low anterior resection
with a coloproctostomy with hand-sewn anastomosis and feeding
jejunostomy. Procedure was uncomplicated.
Post-operatively the patient did well, his pain was controlled
with an epidural.
On POD #1 he was out of bed, was given TPN, and made adequate
urine. His hematocrit remained stable. He was seen and evaluated
by radiation oncology.  His JP drains continued to have
serosanguinous drainage. His dressings were clean, dry, and
intact. His pathology showed low grade adenocarcinoma with
negative margins and 0/12 lymph nodes and therefore was not a
candidate for XRT. He worked with physical therapy and made
progress. A condom catheter was used for his incontinence.
He was maintained on coumadin for DVT prophylaxis. On [**2114-5-23**] he
was started on amp/gent/flagyl. On [**2114-5-24**] he ambulated well
with PT, however with a decreased step length.
Patient had a gout flare during the admission and was started on
indomethacin 25mg PO TID.
By [**2114-5-26**] he was tolerating a soft diet and was passing flatus.
He moved his bowels on [**2114-5-27**] and his antibiotics were
discontinued.
On [**2114-5-28**] his JP drains were discontinued. His TPN was stopped.
His coumadin was also stopped. He tolerated a regular diet which
is to be supplemented by 30cc/hour of Impact with fiber cycled
overnight. He was started on iron treatment for his anemia and
Paxil for a depressed affect. His PICC line was discontinued.
His Indomethacin was changed to a PRN medication should he have
an another gout flare.
