HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1124**] is a 64 year
old man with a past medical history of coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting times
two with mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude valve in
[**2117-6-1**], who presented to the Emergency Room on [**2117-10-10**] complaining of abdominal pain which he had been having
since his heart surgery in [**Month (only) 116**].

The patient reported that his abdominal pain was increasing
in severity, persisting for a longer amount of time and was
more intense.  It was postprandial.  He reported diarrhea.
He reported that the pain was associated with bowel
movements.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a temperature of 97.9, heart rate 77, blood pressure
144/78, respiratory rate 18 and oxygen saturation 99%.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Unremarkable.  Neck:  Supple
without lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  Irregular with a
loud S1 and II/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Diffusely tender with
diminished bowel sounds.  Neurologic:  Nonfocal.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Atrial fibrillation for years,
resistant to cardioversion.  2.  [**2108**], inferior myocardial
infarction with angioplasty time two.  3.  [**2114**],
cerebrovascular accident times two.  4.  Congestive heart
failure.  5.  Asthma.  6.  [**2117-5-2**], myocardial infarction,
congestive heart failure and rib fractures.  7.  [**2117-6-1**],
coronary artery bypass grafting times two, mitral valve
replacement with St. Jude valve and dual pacemaker.  8.
[**2117-9-1**], cardioversion.  9.  [**2117-8-1**], cholecystectomy.
10.  [**2117-5-2**], patient found to have a solitary lung
nodule.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to benzodiazepines, which
cause a paradoxical reaction.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg p.o.q.d., lisinopril
10 mg p.o.q.d., Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.b.i.d., amiodarone 200
mg p.o.q.d., Coumadin 2.5 alternating with 5 mg p.o.q.h.s.,
Ambien p.o.q.h.s.p.r.n., albuterol meter dose inhaler two
puffs b.i.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  A KUB demonstrated dilated loops of bowel.
An abdominal CT showed no bowel wall thickening; it did show
dilated loops of bowel and no diverticulosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service with a presumptive diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia.
He underwent an abdomen angiogram on [**2117-10-10**] and
had angioplasty of his superior mesenteric artery, with
decreased abdominal pain.

On [**2117-10-12**], the patient was seen by the thoracic
surgery service because he had been previously noted to have
a left upper lobe lesion by chest x-ray in [**2117-5-2**].  A CT
scan revealed a T2N2 left upper lobe lesion and possible
right rib metastases on recent bone scan.  Thoracic surgery
recommended consulting medical oncology.

On [**2117-10-14**], the patient complained of increasing
abdominal pain and was found to have evidence of obstruction.
He underwent an [**Year (4 digits) 33270**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2117-10-14**], with pathology results confirming a carcinoid
tumor.

On postoperative days two through four, the patient was noted
to be doing well, with an oxygen saturation of 99% on three
liters nasal cannula.  However, some rales were noted on
examination.  On [**2117-10-19**], the patient was noted to
have an increased respiratory rate to 30 and rales on
examination, which was treated with albuterol nebulizers with
some relief.  A chest x-ray revealed mild congestive heart
failure.  His oxygen saturation decreased to 87% to 91% on
three liters and respiratory rate was in the 30s to 40s.  He
was treated with Lasix with some improvement.  He was ruled
out with cyclic cardiac enzymes.

On [**10-20**] and 20, [**2117**], the patient was not noted to
improve.  He was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit on [**2117-10-21**] and treated with clindamycin and
ciprofloxacin as per infectious disease on [**2117-10-22**].  On [**2117-10-24**], the patient was started on
vancomycin and, by [**2117-10-25**], the patient was noted
to be much improved, feeling well, with decreased shortness
of breath.  He still had a cough which was productive of
clear sputum.  He denied fever, chills, chest pain, nausea,
vomiting or diarrhea.  He was tolerating a small amount of
oral intake, but this was limited secondary to his oxygen
needs.

On a 15 liter nonrebreather mask, the patient's oxygen
saturations were 91% to 96%.  Please note that the [**Hospital 228**]
transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit was in order to
allow utilizing continuous positive airway pressure to
improve oxygenation and gain alveolar recruitment.

On [**2117-10-26**], the patient was found to have a
systolic blood pressure in the 70s to 80s.  This responded to
gentle hydration and return to 104/40.  His oxygen saturation
was 92% to 96% on high flow humidified oxygen at 15 liters
per minute.  His heart rate was 85 in atrial fibrillation.
At this time, the patient was transferred to the Vascular
Intensive Care Unit.

On [**2117-10-26**], the patient was postoperative day 12,
hospital day 16.  He reported that he felt okay, although he
appeared to be in mild respiratory distress.  He was able to
speak in full sentences.  He was afebrile with stable vital
signs.  His oxygen saturation was 86% to 94% on 15 liters
high flow humidified oxygen.

Cardiology was consulted regarding the pulmonary
consultation's recommendation of discontinuing amiodarone.
This was recommended secondary to a rare occurrence of
amiodarone causing pulmonary infiltrates in an acute manner.

On [**2117-10-27**], the patient was postoperative day 13
and hospital day 17.  He reported that he had had a good
previous night, with no complaints.  His oxygen saturation
was 95% on 60% oxygen by face mask.  His blood pressure range
was 88/46 to 110/56.  His examination demonstrated an
irregularly irregular heart rhythm with an S1 present.  His
lungs were clear on the right with some end-expiratory
rhonchi on the left.  His sputum culture had grown out
Hemophilus influenzae, beta lactamase negative.

It was decided to continue the amiodarone at this time.  The
patient's liver function tests, which had been previously
elevated, were trending down, with his AST at 124, down from
352, ALT 148, down from 265, alkaline phosphatase 161, down
from 177 and total bilirubin 0.4, down from 1.1.  His
pneumonia appeared to be clinically improving and he had a
decreased oxygen requirement.

On [**2117-10-29**], postoperative day 15 and hospital day
19, the patient was doing very well, with no complaints.  He
was afebrile and his vital signs were stable.  His oxygen
saturation was 95% on three to four liters by nasal cannula.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  On
[**2117-10-29**], the patient's antibiotic regimen was
changed to oral Levaquin 500 mg daily after pulmonary
recommended this change.

On postoperative day 17, hospital day 21, the patient was
doing well, with no complaints.  He was able to walk with
assistance.  He was afebrile with stable vital signs.  His
respiratory rate was 18 and he was breathing at 97% on three
liters nasal cannula.  His prothrombin time was 13.3, partial
thromboplastin time 58.8, INR 1.2, sodium 134, potassium 4.6,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 25, BUN 15, creatinine 0.8 and
glucose 118.  His heparin drip was increased at this time to
1,200 units/hour.  His Coumadin dose was increased to 7.5 mg
at bedtime.

On [**2117-11-1**], the patient was doing well, with no
complaints.  He was postoperative day 18, Levaquin day four.
He was afebrile with stable vital signs.  His oxygen
saturation was 98% on two liters per nasal cannula.  His
heart was irregular.  His lungs had an occasional crackle but
were otherwise clear.  His abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended, with normal active bowel sounds.  His incision
was clean, dry and intact with Steri-Strips.  His appropriate
was 13.8, partial thromboplastin time
