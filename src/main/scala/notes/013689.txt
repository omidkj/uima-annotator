Chief Complaint:
RUQ pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
60 yo male with history of CABG in [**2176**], DM, and HTN, presented
to an OSH last night with RUQ pain.  Over the past few days
prior to admission, the patient was having intermittent RUQ pain
associated with fevers, chills, and nausea.  The pain has been
progressively worsening in the RUQ and epigastric area, with a
sense of abdominal fullness and excessive burping.  He also
notes cough and feels as if he is unable to take a deep breath
as a result of the pain.  He denies CP, SOB, vomiting,
hemoptysis, and melena, but notes three episodes of diarrhea
last night.  At the OSH, he was found to be hypotensive upon
arrival.  He was given IVF with peripheral dopamine for support.
 Labs were notable for a lipase of 5000, WBC of 20K with 10%
bands, creatinine of 2.9 up from 1.6, bili of 4.2, and
transaminases in 80-150s.  CXR was within normal limits.  RUQ
U/S with pancreas obscured by gas and multiple mobile stones and
debris but no acute signs seen.  CT abdomen revealed a mild
prominent pancreatic head with very mild surrounding stranding,
hepatomegaly, cholelithiasis, duodenal diverticulum, and chronic
diverticulosis.  UA on [**7-29**] reveals SG of 1.027 with 10 WBC's,
and positive leuk esterase.   He was given IVF and sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.
.
On the floor, the patient was in a significant amount of
abdominal discomfort with excessive burping.  He reports that he
has never had this pain before, has never had a gallstone
before, and does not drink EtOH.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P
# Gallstone pancreatitis:
-lipase of 1600 on admission
-No history of EtOH abuse. TG were 175.
-ERCP was done which showed multiple filling defects c/w sludge
/ stone fragments in the CBD.  Otherwise normal cholangiogram. A
sphincterotomy was also performed and multiple stone fragments
and sludge were extracted using a balloon.
Prior to ERCP the patient received 1 unit of blood and 2 units
of FFP.

# Hypotension: presented with Hypotension with leukocytosis and
bandemia only responsive to pressors at OSH. Suspected that this
was likely a result of pancreatitis, and less likely a second
infection.
-did not require pressors at the [**Hospital1 18**]

#A. Fib/aflutter
-on [**8-1**] developed AF with RVR and angina
-described angina, though likely rate-related, was easy to
terminate with NTG, O2, ASA,
-the RVR required three IV Metoprolol 5mg doses Pkus oral
metoptolol followed by Dilt 20mg IV followed by standing oral
metoprolol. Converted to sinus rhythm and has been in SR or
sinus brady in the 50s ever since.   Also his atenolol was held
on presentation.  He also had recurrent afib rvr on [**8-7**] that
was controlled with IV diltiazem and he has been in sinus since
dose adjustments.  He will be sent home on diltiazem 180mg xl qd
for rate control
-Ruled out for MI. Suspecion that his AF was due to volume
overload in the ICU.
-CHADS = 2.  Initially started on ASA 325mg given recent
procedure and since his CBC remained stable we started coumadin
5mg on [**8-7**] without a LMWH bridge.  He was guaic negative on
exam.  He is instructed to have his INR checked within 5 days
and have results managed by his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] he will see on [**8-13**].  He
will also see his cardiologist on [**8-17**].   He Was not
anticoagulated due to his recent GI procedure with bleed, but
was started on ASA 162mg and given stable hematocrit this was
advanced to 325mg.
--TSH checked for afib w/u and returned at 5.2 (elevated),
possible sick euthyroid.  Recommend outpatient repeat TSH value.

#Acute systolic and diastolic heart failure: with h/o CAD s/p
3vCABG
-Echo ([**2181-8-1**]) = LVEF of 50%, increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg), Grade II (moderate) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction, focal hypokinesis of the
distal septum c/w CAD (new since [**2176**]) - has known CAD
-diuresis was started with furosemide and the evidence of volume
overload (likely due to aggressive fluid resuscitation in the
ICU), including B/L LE and scrotal edema, improved. Of note, he
did not respond to 20 mg or oral lasix, but did respond to 40mg.
 Cardiology was consulted and did not feel he required cath or
stress test at this time.  Serial troponins negative.  No BB on
board as he is on CCB for rate control.  Ace-I dose reduced as
BPs in the low 100-110s.

# Acute kidney injury:
-Creatinine initially elevated from baseline of 1.6 to 2.9.
-was aggressively hydrated and his serum creatinine fell to 1.1

#Right ankle and foot pain:
-acute, severe - clinically consistent with his history of gout
-responded to oral colchicine, which is stopped prior to
discharge
-NSAIDS were avoided due to his renal failure and heart failure
-steroids avoided in the setting of DM
 .
# DM II - questionable history as A1c is 5.6 on check.  Not
discharged on any diabetic drugs at discharge.

# HTN: Lisinopril and now diltiazem, atenolol stopped.
