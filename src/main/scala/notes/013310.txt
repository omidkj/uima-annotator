History of Present Illness:
71 yo F w/ CAD, ischemic [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7921**] (EF 10%) s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD, atrial

.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a resident at NE [**Hospital1 **] where she is convalescing
from a polyarticular MRSA septic arthritis. She has NYHA IV CHF
at baseline but over the last 4 days has developed 4+ LE edema
and ascites where there was previously none. She was presented
with the choice to pursue cardiac transplantation more than 12
years ago when given the diagnosis of end-stage CHF. She opted
against that.
.
Per her recent visit note at [**Hospital **] clinic, she continues to have L
shoulder pain, though significantly improved from a few weks
ago. She continues to work with PT to improve her ROM. She has
no pain at her R 3rd MCP, though has difficulty extending her
finger at that joint. She continues to have mild pain and
significant weakness at her L
hip, though improved since hospital discharge. She has had no
F/C/NS, and no problems with her midline. She has had
progression
of a sacral decub, which gives her the majority of her pain.
There has not been concern on the part of her rehab for
superinfection, and it is being treated with local wound care
and
frequent turning. Her sister is hoping to transfer her to [**Hospital1 599**]

within the next several days.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2180-1-12**]: IMPRESSION:
1. High lying right PICC line, terminating in the region of the
right
subclavian vein. Recommend repositioning or removal.
2. Persistent severe cardiomegaly.
3. Small left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
4. Mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle, may be due to
a trace
effusion and/or thickening.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2180-1-13**] 7:49 AM
AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Marked cardiomegaly is stable. A
right internal
jugular catheter with its tip in the low SVC, a right-sided
venous catheter
with its tip in the subclavian vein and left-sided AICD with its
leads
overlying the right atrium and right ventricle are unchanged.
Small bilateral
effusions are stable. There is slight increase in vascular
engorgement since
[**93**] hours prior. There is no consolidation or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Mild increase in vascular engorgement, otherwise no
change since
[**81**] hours prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo F w/ CAD, ischemic [**Month/Day/Year 7921**] (EF 10%) s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD, atrial
fibrillation, CKD, with past history of DVT and PE on Coumadin
who was recently discharged from the CCU ([**11-5**]) for CHF
exacerbation c/b C.diff infection and on [**12-3**] for septic joint
washout c/b failure to extubate [**1-18**] CHF exacerbation, who was
admitted from [**Hospital 1902**] clinic with total body fluid overload.
.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:
Patient has endstage systolic heart failure [**1-18**] ischemic [**Last Name (LF) 7921**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
10%, s/p BiV ICD ([**Company 1543**] Concerto C154DWK) [**12-24**] with EF 10%,
presenting with significant fluid overload. She was diuresed 9L
of fluid during her stay in the CCU with symptomatic
improvement.  Her blood pressure and forward cardiac flow were
maintained initially with neosynephrine, then with a milrinone
drip for two days.  After a trial of stopping the milrinone
drip, systolic blood pressures dropped from 90s to 70s, so
milrinone was restarted for one more day. Milrinone was again
stopped after the primary goal of care became comfort measures
only.

Patient had been made aware of her endstage condition by her
primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], during past hospitalizations;
on presentation at this admission, her long term goals were
comfort.  Her ICD was turned off during her stay in the CCU.
The primary CCU team and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] held a family meeting, at
which the goals of care were made clear to be comfort measures
only.  Palliative Care was also consulted to help with the
transition to comfort measures.

After milrinone was discontinued the second time, patient's
blood pressures were maintained in the 90s systolic.

The patient should not be hospitalized further for congestive
heart failure.  Her anticoagulation was stopped, and she will
remain on po antibiotics for her septic joints to prevent pain
associated with worsening infection which would cause further
pain.  Her pain medications may be uptitrated as necessary.  She
is maintained currently on 20mg torsemide once daily. If she
develops shortness of breath, she may be given morphine for
comfort.

# Septic Joints:
Patient with history +staph aureus in left shoulder treated by
washout and vancomycin, 4 weeks of monotherapy by the time of
this admission. She has had no positive blood cultures since
before [**2179-11-25**].  Her pain was controled on ultram, standing
tylenol, and long-acting morphine.  On [**2180-1-20**], the vancomycin
course finished, and she was switched to oral doxycycline for
indefinite prophylaxis.
.
# Sacral Decubitus Ulcer:
Patient has unstageable decubitus ulcer, which she had prior to
admission.  Her pain is being controlled with standing ultram,
standing tylenol, MS Contin, and immediate release morphine.
Her pain worsens significantly when moved.  These pain
medications may be uptitrated as necessar
