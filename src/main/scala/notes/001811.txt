Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers/rigors.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy
Endoscopic ultrasound with biospy
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 426**] is an 85 year-old woman with a history of CAD
recently noted abdominal mass who presents with fevers/rigors
and bandemia.
.
Over the last few weeks leading up to admission, she has been
experiencing mid-abdominal pain, radiating to the left flank.
It lasts throughout the day is not increased by eating though
there is associated vomiting and is worsened with coughing.
.
Was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] on [**4-14**] who felt that the pain might be
seconodary to diverticulitis.  CT abdomen without contrast was
then performed on [**4-20**] showing a large 9.5 x 7.5 x 6.0-cm
heterogeneous left upper abdominal mass.
.
On the morning of admission, was noted to have rigors/shaking
chills.  Also felt nauseated and fatigued.  She presented to the
ED for further care.
.
In the ED, initial vitals included T 100.9, HR 76, BP 145/61 and
SaO2 96%.  CXR and UA were negative.  Given possible GI source,
empiric zosyn was given.  Noted to be transiently hypotensive to
80s and recieved a total of 4 liters of IVF with improvement in
lactate 4.0-->2.2-->1.8.  Also spiked to 102.
.
ROS:
(+) 4lb weight loss over months; due to "poor appetite"
(-) night sweats
(-) chest pain, shortness of breath, palpatations
(+) diarrhea after oral constrast for CT abd
(+) nausea, occasional vomiting
(+) BRBPR after oral constrast for CT abd
(+) arthritis

CT ABD ([**2140-4-20**]):
1. Large 9.5 x 7.5 x 6.0-cm heterogeneous left upper abdominal
mass with areas of low and high density suggesting hemorrhage.
Underlying tumor is suspected, however, not fully assessed
without IV contrast. Origin of mass is not clear, but not likely
adrenal, renal or gastric in origin. Given mass effect on the
colon, retroperitoneal mass such as pancreatic hemorrhagic tumor
or hemorrhagic pseudocyst arising from the pancreatic tail is
considered, although no findings of acute pancreatitis are seen.
Exophytic splenic or colonic mass are also considered, although
less likely.
2. Large amount of stool proximal to the compressed splenic
flexure.
3. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Several hypoattenuating foci in the liver are incompletely
characterized.
5. Cholelithiasis.
.
CXR (5/16/0):  No consolidation or edema is evident. Mild
prominence of the right hilum is evident. There is a tortuous
atherosclerotic aorta. The cardiac silhouette is borderline
enlarged with incidental note made of mitral annulus
calcification. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The
visualized osseous structures are osteopenic.
.
RUQ U/S ([**2140-4-23**]): Panc duct dilated but panc not well
visualized; if pncreatitis suspected coorelate with labs GB
appears distended with cholelithiasis but no GB wall thickening,
fluid or CDB dilatation
.
CT abd:
IMPRESSION:
1. No free air in the abdomen.
2. Interval decrease of splenic flexure mass. Corroboration with
the
colonoscopy report would be helpful. The reported drainage of
pus after
biopsy at the depressions site suggests a fluid component of
this mass. This could represent an abscess or hematoma from
possibly prior colonic
infection/inflammation, especially given the sigmoid
diverticulosis. 3.
Unchanged appearance of pancreatic head mass, with abrupt ending
of the
dilated pancreatic duct. Please refer to the recent MRCP for
better
characterization.
4. Sludge-filled gallbladder without evidence of acute
cholecystitis.
5. New small left pleural effusion.

Repeat CT:
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:
Again seen in the left upper quadrant is a heterogeneous lesion
centered at the pancreatic tail/splenic hilum/splenic flexure.
This lesion is centrally hypoattenuating (28 [**Doctor Last Name **]) and was
previously characterized as containing blood products on the
prior MRCP dated [**2140-4-25**]. This lesion has decreased in size
when compared to the prior CT scan dated [**2140-4-20**] perhaps
secondary to decompression after biopsy of the splenic flexure
at colonoscopy as there is a description of purulent material
emanating from the colonic biopsy site. This lesion currently
measures 4.6 cm TV x 2.6 cm AP x 2.6 cm CC. While this mass
lesion abuts the splenic artery, there is no evidence of splenic
artery encasement or thrombosis.
Pancreatic Tumor Table:
I: Pancreatic tumor present: Yes.
a) Location: Pancreatic head.
b) Size: 2.1 cm TV x 2.5 cm AP x 3.1 cm CC.
c) Enhancement relative to pancreas: [**Name (NI) **].
d) Confined to pancreas with clear fat planes (duodenum and IVC
do not
apply): Yes.
e) Remaining pancreas: Fluid-attenuating lesion (blood products)
centered at the pancreatic tail as described above. Pancreatic
duct dilation measuring up to 5mm.
II. Adenopathy present: No.
III. Metastatic disease, definitely present: No.
IV: Ascites/peripancreatic fluid: No evidence of ascites.
Pancreatic Vascular Table:
I: Vascular Tumor Involvement: No.
a) Celiac involvement: No.
b) SMA involvement: No.
c) SMV involvement and percent encasement: No.
d) Less than 1 cm SMV between tumor and first major SMV branch:
Yes,
approximately 5 mm.
e) Portal vein involvement: No.
g) Splenic vein involvement: No.
h) Splenic artery involvement and distance from tumor to celiac
artery
bifurcation: No, approximately 3.3 cm.
II: Thrombosis, any vessel: No.
III: Aberrant Anatomy: No.
Stable hypoattenuating lesions are seen in the liver measuring
up to 6 mm
which were characterized as hepatic cysts on the prior MRCP
dated [**2140-4-25**]. No evidence of intra- or extra- hepatic bile duct
dilation. Sludge and gallstones layer dependently in the
gallbladder.

Adrenal glands are unchanged. As previously described, the right
kidney is
smaller than the left kidney. Hypoattenuating lesions are seen
in the kidneys bilaterally, likely representing renal cysts. The
largest of these lesions is in the low
