[**5-26**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in the prominence of a left subdural acute
hemorrhage. 2. Mild increase in a left subarachnoid hemorrhage
and unchanged right subarachnoid hemorrhage. 3. Increasingly
prominent right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 5
x 7 mm.

[**5-26**] CT Torso: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute fracture.
2. Peripheral round-glass opacities in the right upper lobe
concerning for
pulmonary contusions. 3. A septated right mid polar and a
high-density right lower pole cyst should be further evaluated
with a renal ultrasound on a non-emergent basis. 4. ETT
terminates ~ 1 cm above the carina, suggest withdrawal by [**11-19**]
cm. 5. Bibasilar atelectasis and possible aspiration.

[**5-26**]: CT C-spine: IMPRESSION: Rotation of C1 on C2 is likely
positional. No acute fracture.

[**5-27**]: CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. New trace IVH. Decreased left SAH and rightward shift.
Unchanged diffuse SAH and focal IPH. 2. ICP monitor. 3.
Paranasal sinus disease.

[**5-29**]: Chest X ray
Diffuse opacities in left lower lung with atelectasis.

[**5-29**]: Sputum gram stain and culture
2+ Gram negative rods, gram positive rods and gram positive
cocci.

[**5-31**] CXR
In comparison with the study of [**5-29**], there is continued
opacification involving much of the lower half of the left lung.
Again this is consistent with volume loss and pleural effusion.
However, suggestion of some air bronchograms would be consistent
with the clinical suspicion of supervening pneumonia.
The right lung remains essentially clear and the monitoring and
support
devices are unchanged.

[**6-1**] CXR
Moderate left pleural effusion with left lower lobe opacity that
could
represent pneumonia or atelectasis.

[**2181-6-5**]
In comparison with study of [**6-1**], the endotracheal tube has been

removed and has been replaced by a tracheostomy tube.
Nasogastric tube has
been removed. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
with engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels consistent
with elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Atelectatic changes are
seen at the bases and the left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen.
This is consistent with atelectasis and effusion, though
supervening pneumonia can certainly not be excluded.

[**2181-6-5**]
 No evidence of right or left lower extremity DVT.

[**6-5**] CTA chest
1. Solitary fresh non-occlusive pulmonary embolism segmental
branch of the
right middle lobe. No evidence of pulmonary infarction, right
heart strain or pulmonary hypertension.

2. Progression of now complete atelectasis of both lower lobes
is more likely to account for the patient's shortness of breath.


CXR [**2181-6-6**]:
Tracheostomy is in standard position. Left lower lobe opacity is
a
combination of moderate pleural effusion and left lower lobe
collapse. Right pleural effusion is small. There is a platelike
atelectasis in the right mid lung. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is unchanged. There is mild cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 44M motorcycle accident with traumatic brain
injury, he was admitted to the ICU for close neurological exam
and placed on seizure prophylaxis medications. During the first
few hours of his hospitalization he had a poor neurological exam
for which a bolt was placed. His ICPs remained within normal
level and the bolt was discontinued on [**5-28**]. His neurological
exam was stable with him MAE's, but did not follow commands. On
[**5-29**] his SBP was liberalized to 160. He was written for transfer
to the SDU but his oxygenation decompensated and he dropped to
70% O2 saturations. He was intubated and stat chest x ray showed
complete white out of his left lung. A bronchoscopy was
performed and secretions were cleared. A gram stain of the
sputum showed GPC, GNR and GPR. Antibiotics were started on [**5-30**]
for empiric treatment of VAP. His WBC remained in normal limits
and he was afebrile.

On [**5-31**], he remained intubated.  His neuro exam improved as per
nurses.  He is scheduled for a tracheostomy and Percutaneous
G-tube placement on [**6-1**].  He tolerated the procedure well
without complications.  His sedation was weaned and
neurologically he began to improve.  On [**6-4**], he was trasnferred
to SDU in stable condition.  He was screened for rehab by pt/ot
and speech.  He was started on Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia.

On [**6-5**], his WBC raised to 18 and a UA was sent. IT was without
sign of infection. sputum culture showed....His oxygen
saturation was in the low 90's and a RR in the 30's. CTA showed
a small subsegmental PE. While in the scanner, saturation
dropped to the 70's. ABG showed a metabolic alkalosis. Medicine
was consulted. They recommended continuing Vancomycin to treat
MRSA PNA and wanted ID consulted. They recommended transfering
the patient to the ICU for closer observation and possible need
of vent and frequent chest PT. For his PE it was decided due to
the small size it would only be treated with SQ Heparin and full
anticoagulation was held due to intracranial hemorrhages.

Early on [**6-7**] he was transferred out of the ICU his most recent
sputum and urine cultures were finalized as negative. His
respiratory status was much improved now respirations were in
the 20s and saturing 98% on 40% FIO2.  On [**6-8**], pat was afebrile
and respiratory status was stable.  A picc line was placed in
routine fashion.  ID recommend he continue Vancomycing for 14
days from the date of [**6-7**].   He was set for d/c rehab in stable
condition and will follow-up accordingly.
