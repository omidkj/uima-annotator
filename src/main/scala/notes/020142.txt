Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) unsuccessful pericardiocentesis
2) successful anterior pericardectomy and drainage of
pericardial effusion

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 38 year-old female with a history of SLE,
anticardiolipin antibodies, multiple DVTs, including while on
therapeutic coumadin dosing, who now presents with 3-4 days of
constant pleuritic chest pain. The patient reports that the pain
is central in the chest, mid-sternum, and radiates through the
chest to the back. The pain does not radiate to the arm or to
the neck. There has been no associated diaphoresis, nausea,
vomiting, or shortness of breath, although the patient does note
that breathing is uncomfortable due to the pleuritic nature of
her pain. She reports that the pain is worsened by lying down,
and gets better when she sits up. The patient reports that she
has been compliant with all her medications. She denies any
antecedent illnesses, cough, sputum production, or URI symptoms.
She states that she has had pleuritis in the past, caused by her
SLE, but does not recall if this current pain is similar.
.
In the ED, the patient was found to be febrile to 101.1. She
denies dysuria or urinary frequency. She denies abdominal pain,
no nausea or vomiting. Basic labs obtained in the emergency room
revealed a markedly supratherapeutic INR at 10.9. She states
that she has not deviated recently from her usual warfarin
dosing regimen.

.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.  There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
Renal u/s:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis or renal vein thrombosis.
2. Normal ultrasonographic appearance of the kidneys.

[**2185-5-11**] Chest CTA: Study is limited by patient's body habitus
and breathing artifact. New large pericardial effusion,
measuring greater than 3 cm is identified. There appears to be
slight indentation on the ventricles and atrium. There is no
evidence of aortic dissection. No central pulmonary embolism is
seen. No focal consolidations or pleural effusions are seen.
Linear opacities consistent with atelectasis are seen at the
lung bases. The previously described hilar lymphadenopathy and
pulmonary nodules are not well appreciated on today's study,
possibly secondary to breathing motion artifact. Limited views
of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are
identified.
Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large new pericardial effusion.
2. No evidence of aortic dissection or central pulmonary
embolism.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] immediately
following completion of study with recommendation for
echocardiogram.

[**5-12**] Transthoracic echocardiogram:
PERICARDIUM: Large pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential. No
significant respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve
flows. Brief RA diastolic collapse. RV diastolic collapse, c/w
impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
Conclusions:
There is a large pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse. There is right
ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.
IMPRESSION: TAMPONADE

[**2185-5-13**]: CXR: Large post-operative cardiomediastinal silhouette
stable. No pneumothorax. Small left pleural effusion, probably
unchanged. Residual left perihilar consolidation probably
atelectasis, improved. Right lung grossly clear. No
pneumothorax.

[**2185-5-16**] Echocardiogram: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.  Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
38 year-old woman with history of SLE, anticardiolipin antibody,
multiple DVTs, frequent chest pain who presents to the ED with
chest pain x3 days and fever, likely pleuritis/pericarditis from
SLE flare.  Course complicated by developmen t of pericardial
effusion with tamponade s/p emergent pericardectomy.
