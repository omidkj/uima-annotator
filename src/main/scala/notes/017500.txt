Admission Date: [**2132-4-27**]        Discharge Date: [**2132-5-1**]

Service:  Neurology


Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old Russian female found unresponsive on
[**2132-4-26**] and brought to the Emergency Department at the
[**Hospital1 69**].  Subsequent workup showed
large interventricular hemorrhage in all four ventricles and
hydrocephalus and subarachnoid hemorrhages bilaterally.
Patient was deemed to be DNR/DNI, and was initially
transferred to the Neuro/ICU here at the [**Hospital1 346**].

While in the ICU, the patient has been somnolent and unable
to be aroused.  Neurosurgical consult was called on the
patient and they did not recommend intervention at family's
request.  She developed bilateral pleural effusions in the
ICU from CHF that had been treated with p.o. Lasix, yet
remained persistent.  Her blood pressure was controlled with
IV medications, but now that has been D/C'd.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Chest x-ray.
3. Hypertension.
4. Degenerative joint disease.
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6. Essential tremor.
7. Urinary incontinence.

After extensive discussion and education with the patient's
family and healthcare proxy, it was decided that a non-
aggressive palliative approach would be adopted in directing
care for this patient given the poor prognosis with the
interventricular hemorrhage complicated the goal of the
patient's admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.4, blood pressure
142/76, pulse 108, respiratory rate 16, and 98 percent on 35
percent O2 face mask.  Physical examination was pertinent for
the following:  The patient was an elderly female lying in
bed in modest distress with labored breathing.  Decreased
breath sounds on pulmonary exam halfway up both lungs.
Patient's heart rhythm was regular.  There was a 3/6 systolic
ejection murmur radiating to the right upper sternal border.
On neurologic examination, on mental status:  The patient
grimaces and opens eyes to vigorous sternal rub, but prefers
her eyes closed.  On cranial nerve examination, the patient
has dolls intact, corneal intact, and gag reflex intact.
Pupils are surgical bilaterally.  Motor examination:  The
patient moves right upper extremity to painful stimulus, but
there is no movement in the left upper extremity to painful
stimulus.  Patient dorsiflexes both lower extremities to
pain, but does not withdraw.  Patient has flexor plantar
responses bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  Patient had CBC, Chem-8, and chest x-rays in a
serial fashion drawn throughout the admission.  Chest x-ray
showed static bilateral pleural effusions despite treatment
with Lasix.  Follow-up head CT showed blood in all
ventricles, positive atrophy, and questionable hydrocephalus,
which remains unchanged from initial head CT.

Patient had an elevated sodium at 146 and BUN of 31.  Patient
also had a troponin of 0.25 on serial cardiac enzymes that
were drawn throughout the admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's palliative goal,
patient was kept DNR/DNI throughout the admission, and
comfort care was established after the patient was
transferred to the Neurologic floor on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 from the
Neuro/ICU.  Patient was given Lasix for symptomatic relief of
bilateral pleural effusions and aortic stenosis.  Patient's
mental status remained static on the Neurology floor.  She
was unresponsive to voice and vigorous painful stimulus.
Neurosurgical consult signed off on the case after deeming
that the patient was not a surgical candidate.

On [**2132-4-30**], the patient's daughter decided to make the
patient comfort care only.  Morphine drip was started.
Patient's respirations and vital signs were monitored
regularly to assess comfort.  Palliative Care consult was
called, which recommended scopolamine patch for secretions,
Tylenol for fever, and Morphine drip.

Patient then expired on [**2132-5-1**].  Family was informed.
Autopsy was accepted.
