Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Elongated LA. No spontaneous
echo contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Cannot exclude LAA
thrombus. All four pulmonary veins identified and enter the left
atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler. Prominent Eustachian valve (normal
variant).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size. Normal regional LV systolic function. Low normal LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Characteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve leaflets
with fused commissures and tethering of leaflet motion. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Mild valvular MS (MVA 1.5-2.0cm2). Eccentric MR
jet. Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Due to image
quality, a left atrial appendage thrombus cannot be completely
excluded. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The mitral valve shows
characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is moderate thickening
of the mitral valve chordae. There is mild valvular mitral
stenosis (area 2.0cm2). An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet
of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen originating between
the A1 and P1 mitral valve scallops. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the operating room at the time of the
study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being AV paced. Epinephrine was used
initially when separating from bypass but then quickly weaned.
The right ventricle displays normal systolic function, though
the amount of tricuspid regurgitation is now moderate and so
intrinsic right ventricular function may be somewhat less than
normal. The left ventricle displayed severe lateral wall
hypokinesis during initial separation from bypass but this
quickly resolved. Left ventricular systolic function was the
