HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
woman with a history of longstanding multiple sclerosis
treated with baclofen intrathecal pump that was recently
reinserted on [**11-29**] due to a low signal on the
previous pump.

The patient was in her usual state of health after that
procedure until two days prior to admission when she
developed fevers and chills.  The patient noted a fever at
home of 102.7.  She also had some nausea and decreased p.o.
intake over the previous two days as well.  She did have
lightheadedness.  She denies photophobia and back pain, chest
pain, shortness of breath, and diarrhea.  She did note neck
stiffness, however.  The patient went to the Emergency
Department, where she was febrile to 102, and her blood
pressure was as low as 85/36 and was given a total of 3
liters of normal saline down in the ED with improvement of
her blood pressure.  She was then transferred to the Fenard
ICU for further management.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives in nursing home.  She has a 20
pack year smoking history, quit 20 years ago.  She has
occasional alcohol and no IV drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, her temperature was
97.8, heart rate 26, blood pressure 105/62, respiratory rate
18, and satting at 94% on room air.  In general, she was an
elderly woman in no acute distress.  Head and neck exam was
notable for having extraocular movements intact, dry mucous
membranes.  Her neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.  Her
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  On cardiac
examination, showed a regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended with active bowel sounds.  She had significant
erythema, warmth, and tenderness over her left lower quadrant
over the incision site.  There was no tracking towards the
back.  Her extremities had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Neurologic examination:  She was alert and oriented times
three.  Her upper extremities [**5-13**], bilateral lower
extremities was [**2-13**], this is approximately her baseline.  Her
back had slight tenderness over the L2 area without any
erythema.

LABORATORY DATA:  She had a white count of 24.1 with 86%
polys, 2% bands, 4% lymphocytes, her hematocrit was 45.8,
platelets 320.  Her Chem-7 was unremarkable.  Her lactate was
2.9.  Her urinalysis had no leuks, nitrite, or blood.

Abdominal CT scan showed no abscess or obstruction.  Due to
artifact in the abdominal wall, the pump was not easily
evaluated.

She had a chest film that showed no evidence of pneumonia.

Her EKG was unchanged.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cellulitis:  The patient was admitted to the ICU
presumably for sepsis.  She was initially covered with
Vancomycin and ceftriaxone with a steady improvement over the
next several days with erythema and tenderness over the area.
The patient did not have any Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign
and there was no nuchal rigidity despite the neck and head
ache.  There was no photophobia.

Due to her rapid improvement and the fact that there was no
tracking on her abdomen, a LP was not performed.  Blood
cultures were taken and were negative at the time of this
dictation.

With respect to her hypotension, the patient was responsive
to normal saline, and so it was felt to be a combination of
hypovolemia and potentially sepsis.

2. Baclofen pump/chronic pain:  The Pain service was
consulted, who knows her well, and while they initially
considered removing the device, her rapid improvement over
several days allowed the patient to keep her current pump in
place without having to remove it.

After two days, the patient was initially on Vancomycin and
ceftriaxone, which was changed to ceftazidime due to the
presence of intrathecal device.  On transfer to the floor,
the patient was afebrile and her blood pressure improved
steadily back to her preadmission values and her home
medications were restarted.  The patient will continue to
have two weeks more of antibiotics with Vancomycin and
ceftazidime.
