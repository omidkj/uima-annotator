Service:  Cardiac Intensive Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 3315**] is an 83-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, aortic stenosis,
hyperlipidemia, and mild congestive obstructive pulmonary
[**2-8**] complaining of dizziness after a
breath, or palpitations.  The etiology of the fall and the
dizziness was unclear to her primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 12883**].

The patient was sent home and did well until the day of
presentation when after lunch while lying on her bed, she
diaphoresis.  This sensation did not radiate.  It was not
associated with any shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or
she tried standing during this episode.  The pain lasted
roughly 30-45 minutes unabated.  She then called 911, and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Room.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate to the 150s with
blood pressure systolic in the 60s.  The patient was
unsuccessfully cardioverted x2 at 200 joules, and given Lopressor
2.5 mg IV x2 without any improvement in her rate or blood
pressure.  The patient however, mentated throughout the
entire treatment in the Emergency Room without any chest pain
or shortness of breath.

Following the unsuccessful second cardioversion, the patient
was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.  At that
time, she was still found to be in atrial fibrillation with a
rapid ventricular rate into the 120s. Then she had an arterial
line placed in her right arm during which the patient
spontaneously converted to sinus bradycardia with occasional
premature atrial complexes.  Her heart rate dropped to 50s to
80s, and her blood pressure rose to 120/30s. She was then
admitted to CCU for further observation and workup of the atrial
fibrillation and evaluation of her aortic stenosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Aortic stenosis.  Catheterization in [**2133-8-28**]
showed an area of aortic valve at 1.04 cm squared, a gradient
of 0.23.  An echocardiogram in [**2134-9-27**] showed an
ejection fraction of 55%, previous echocardiogram in [**2135-9-27**] showed a left atrium 4.4 cm in size and valve area of
0.9 cm squared.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5. Mild congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
6. Rotator cuff injuries bilaterally status post left rotator
cuff repair six weeks ago.
7. Cholecystectomy.
8. Status post appendectomy.
9. C section x3.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa drugs unknown reaction and sublingual
nitroglycerin results in hypotension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives by herself in elevator apartment.  She
has a son and a daughter who live in [**Name (NI) 17679**], and another
daughter who lives in [**Name (NI) 3914**].

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies any recent illnesses,
but since her shoulder surgery six weeks ago she had
decreased po intake secondary to cup holding difficulties.
She denies any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, or
edema.  She does note that she has had dizziness for several
weeks that was worked up by her primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
has remained of uncertain etiology.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon arrival on the Cardiac Care Unit
post arterial line placement, the patient was found to have a
temperature of 97.4, blood pressure 124/56, heart rate 88,
breathing at 19, and sating 99% on two liters nasal cannula.

General:  She is lying in bed, sitting up in no acute
distress.

HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx is clear and
slightly dry mucous membranes, left surgical pupil.

Neck:  Supple, carotid upstrokes and no jugular venous
distention.

Cardiovascular:  Irregularly, irregular, normal S1, S2, 4/6
systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border and left
lower sternal border radiating both to the neck and to the
axilla.  It is a crescendo-decrescendo murmur.  There were no
rubs or gallops.

Lungs:  There is sparse crackles at the bases, no wheezes or
rhonchi.

Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal bowel sounds.

Extremities:  There is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Neurologic:  She is alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII are grossly intact and moves all
extremities symmetrically and sensation is intact.  Her left
leg was generally held in extension, but had full passive and
active range of motion without pain.

LABORATORIES AND STUDIES:  On admission, the patient had the
following complete blood count:  White count of 14.2,
hematocrit of 34.1, platelet count of 234.  MCV was 91, 82%
polys, 0% bands, 12% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes.
Urinalysis showed 15 ketones, [**3-1**] white cells, rare bacteria.
Urine culture and blood cultures were negative throughout
this hospital stay.

Chemistry-7 was as follows:  Sodium 140, potassium 3.6,
chloride 103, bicarb 26, BUN 26, creatinine 0.8, and glucose
109, calcium 9.0, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 3.4.  She had a
TSH at 1.2.

Her arterial blood gas at the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit on a
100% NRB mask was the following:  7.39, 42, 400, and
98%.

Her CKs through the hospital stay were as follows:  The first
one was 59.  The second one was 107 with a MB of 12.  Third
one of 148 and MB of 10, 152 with a MB of 5, and 202 with a
MB of 4 on the day of discharge.

Her chest x-ray on admission showed mild cardiomegaly, no
congestive heart failure, or pneumonia were present.  Of
note, a cardiac catheterization in [**2133-8-28**] showed
only a 30% occlusion in the first diagonal branch, no other
coronary artery disease.

She had electrocardiogram done revealed normal sinus rhythm
in the 50s.  There were no ST-T wave changes indicating acute
ischemia.   An echocardiogram done on [**12-15**] showed the
following:  Her left atrium had increased in size from 4.4
enlarged to 5.6 now.  Her A-V valve area was 0.6 cm squared.  Her
ejection  fraction remained high with a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 70-80.  Her TR gradient had increased from 14 to 33.
The RA was mildly dilated with no septal defect.  She had mild
symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy.  Her right free wall
was hypertrophied.  She had severe AS, she had severe mitral
annular calcification with no stenosis, moderate mitral
regurgitation, mild pulmonary systolic hypertension, but no
pericardial effusion.

On the day of discharge, her laboratories are as follows:
complete blood count:  White count of 12.5, hematocrit of
32.3, platelet count of 203.  PT 12.5, PTT 24.3, and INR of
1.0.  Chemistry 7 showed a sodium of 143, potassium 4.0,
chloride 108, bicarb 37, BUN 21, creatinine 0.6, calcium 8.3,
magnesium 1.8, and phosphorus 2.0.

During her hospital stay, she also had the following studies:
She had a ultrasound of her left groin which showed a 10.5 x
12.5 x 5.8 cm hematoma in the left groin.  Flow was good in
the femoral arteries and veins with no pseudoaneurysm.  She
had CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis on the [**12-15**]
which showed no retroperitoneal hematoma, extensive
diverticular disease, and two cysts in her right kidney, and
an abdominal hernia.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Pump:  Following her conversion to normal sinus rhythm
spontaneously in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, the
patient's blood pressure was still 120-130/56.  She has
remained in that range throughout the remainder of her
hospitalization.  She was given total of roughly 7 liters of
fluids during her hospital stay, and became fluid
overloaded.  She was subsequently diuresed over several days,
and was euvolemic on the day of discharge.

In addition, she had the echocardiogram previously mentioned.
This demonstrated a progression of her aortic stenosis with a
valve area of now 0.6.  This is likely in some
