Chief Complaint:
nausea/vomiting

GJ tube placement
exploratory laparotomy with surgical GJ tube placement


History of Present Illness:
68 year old female w/ ESRD on dialysis, gastroparesis, and Type
II diabetes presents with 1 week of increased nausea, vomiting
and generalized weakness. She was recently hospitalized in [**9-22**]
with a MSSA bacteremia (TEE negative for vegetations), for which
she was treated with 2 weeks of vancomycin. Since then, she has
felt generally weak, but this has worsened over the last [**11-18**]
weeks to the point that she is having difficulty ambulating,
although she has not had any falls. She has chronic
nausea/vomiting, which is attributed to gastroparesis, however
this has been worse over the last week, with minimal PO intake.
The vomiting can occur at any time and is not only associated
with eating. No hemetemesis or coffee grounds emesis. She notes
reflux symptoms which have worsened over the last 1-2 weeks, but
denies abdominal pain. She has chronic diarrhea (1 loose
BM/day), but has noted increased frequency of BM ([**12-20**]/day) over
the last week. (+) 5 lb weight loss over the last 2 weeks.  (+)
sensation of solids occasionally "getting stuck," which she has
had for several months, but which has been worsening over the
last several weeks. No difficulty swallowing liquids. No
coughing after meals. She was seen in the ED [**10-11**] c/o N/V and
weakness, at which time a CXR was negative and 2 sets of CE were
negative; she underwent dialysis and was d/c'd home. She saw a
physician at [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] [**10-23**] after dialysis, at which time she was
noted to be dehydrated and referred to the emergency room. Of
note, she had a GJ tube placed in [**4-22**], which was removed during
her recent hospitalization given that she was eating by herself.
Since its removal, the patient's daughter reports that the
patient has eaten minimally.

ROS: as above, in addition: No fevers. (+) occasional sweats.
Gradual decline in vision over the last several years, but no
recent change. (+) dry mouth. No sinus pain or sore throat. No
chest pain, palpitations, LE edema, DOE, SOB. (+) mild cough X 1
week, minimally productive. No focal weakness, no headache. (+)
generalized pruritis since starting dialysis, no focal rash.
Minimal urine production at baseline, no dysuria. No
bleeding/bruising.

EKG: Sinus rhythm. Since the previous tracing of [**2200-10-12**] the
axis is more leftward. The Q-T interval is longer. Otherwise, as
previously described.

Radiology
[**10-24**] KUB: No evidence of obstruction.

[**10-24**] CXR PA/lateral: There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. The
aorta is noted to be tortuous and calcified. The mediastinal and
hilar contours are stable and normal in appearance. The
pulmonary vascularity is normal. The lungs are clear. There are
no pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. The soft tissues
and osseous structures are unremarkable.

[**10-31**] CXR: Moderate free intraperitoneal air. Clinical
correlation is recommended. Hyperinflated lungs and stable
cardiomyopathy. No evidence of pneumonia, CHF.

[**10-31**] CT Abd/pelvis:  Free intraperitoneal air could be
consistent with recent percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.
Intrahepatic vascular calcifications are again identified. There
is probable mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, not
significantly changed from previous study. Previously described
low-attenuation lesion in segment 6 is not visualized on this
noncontrast- enhanced study. The spleen is unremarkable. The
pancreas is unremarkable. The patient is status post right
nephrectomy, and multiple surgical clips are again noted within
the abdomen. The left kidney again demonstrates multiple
low-attenuation lesions, which allowing for differences in
technique are not significantly changed in size or appearance
from previous study. No free fluid is present within the
abdomen. No evidence of intraabdominal abscess or fluid
collection.

[**11-2**] CXR: Compared to the film from 2 days ago, there continues
to be free air under the hemidiaphragm. There is increased
opacity in the retrocardiac region suggesting volume
loss/infiltrate. The right lung is clear.

[**11-3**] MRI Head: The study is somewhat degraded by motion. There
are stable T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities within the
periventricular and deep white matter of both cerebral
hemispheres consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
There is no restricted diffusion to suggest an acute infarct.
The ventricles are normal. There is no shift of normally midline
structures, enhancing mass, or osseous/soft tissue
abnormalities. The signal intensities of the brain parenchyma
are normal.

[**11-4**] EEG: This was abnormal EEG due to the slow and
disorganized
background and bursts of generalized slowing, consistent with a
mild to
moderate encephalopathy. The most common causes include
infection,
vascular disease, toxic/metabolic disturbances, or medications.

[**11-5**] KUB: GJ tube in place with free intra-abdominal air,
likely unchanged from [**10-31**] CT.

[**11-7**] right hip plain film: No fracture or dislocation. Mild
degenerative changes within both hips. Diffuse osteopenia.
Extensive vascular calcifications.

[**11-7**] CT Head: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, shift of
normally midline structures, major vascular territorial infarct,
or hydrocephalus. There are stable low attenuations in the
periventricular white matter consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemia. There is also stable evidence of atrophy
with prominence of the bifrontal CSF spaces. There are dense
calcifications in the cavernous internal carotid arteries
bilaterally as well as the vertebral arteries bilaterally. There
is no acute fracture or sinus opacification. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved

[**11-8**] Head CT:  No acute intracranial process. Unchanged from
prior study dated [**2200-11-7**]

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old female admitted with nausea, vomiting, weight loss,
likely secondary to gastroparesis. Hospital course complicated
by hemetemesis and peritonitis following GJ tube placement.

1) Gastroparesis: Following admission, the patient was placed on
reglan with meals and the gastroenterology service was
consulted. Given minimal PO intake (calorie
