Admission Date:  [**2153-4-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2127-1-20**]



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 86 year old
man with a history of laryngeal cancer status post radiation,
who initially was admitted to the Plastics Service on [**4-13**],
after increased secretions from an oral cutaneous fistula as
20 and [**4-5**] with a history of bleeding from an oral
cutaneous fistula on his left neck which was approximately 7
by 8 centimeters in size, and at that time, a skin flap was
placed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Laryngeal cancer status post laryngectomy in [**2149**].
therapy.  The patient also had radiation therapy on
[**2153-3-10**], as well.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Aortic valve replacement with ST. Jude's valve.
5.  Subdural hemorrhage noted incidentally on CT scan of the
head in [**2153-2-19**].

ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known history of any
allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   As noted, the patient was admitted on [**4-13**] for increased secretions from the oral cutaneous fistula.
Pulmonary was consulted at that time and they felt that he
likely had an aspiration pneumonitis and hypoxia with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  He was treated with
Ceftazidime as well as Clindamycin.  Also, it was felt at
that time that he might have some possible congestive heart
failure and he was diuresed as well.

On [**4-22**], the patient was seen by Surgery for severe acute
bleeding from his tracheostomy site.  He required eight units
of packed red blood cells as well as seven units of fresh
frozen plasma.  His throat was packed and there was a
suspicion for fistula close to his right carotid.  Of note,
at that time the patient had been anti-coagulation and on
Coumadin for his AVR.

On [**2153-4-24**], there were no signs of acute bleeding from
his fistula sites and Plastics as well as Surgery were
following him.  The plan was to discuss with Interventional
Radiology the possible angiography with wound blockage of the
carotid with or without embolization.  Plans from Plastic
Therapy was for possible hyperbaric oxygen therapy as well as
closure of the oral cutaneous fistula.

A family meeting with the Intensive Care Unit Team occurred
and the family elected for a conservative approach which
included no angiography or no surgical repair at the time.
In addition, there was the decision not to continue
anti-coagulation with Coumadin on this patient.  The family
is aware of the risks of not anti-coagulating including the
risk of stroke, given that the patient has an aortic valve
replacement.  In addition, for the patient's bleeding at that
time, it was a self-limited bleed requiring multiple units,
however, there was still felt to be a high risk of the
patient to rebleed.  As stated, the family elected for
conservative therapy at this time.

Also of note, the patient has been noted to be in atrial
fibrillation.  He became bradycardic when treated with a beta
blocker per report.  The patient also had a CT scan of the
chest which showed moderate pleural effusions as well as
interstitial lung disease.

During the patient's course in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, the patient was diuresed for mild congestive heart
failure.  In addition, the patient was attempting to wean on
Trache collar.  The patient was placed on pressure support of
5 and 5 and as possible was weaning on Trache collar.

The patient had hypertension treated with Captopril as well.
There was a concern for a possible recurrence of the
patient's Pseudomonas tracheobronchitis.  Sputum was sent
which had four plus Gram negative rods and was treated with a
ten day course of Ceftazidime for the Pseudomonas
tracheobronchitis.  In addition, the patient had a
thoracentesis for the pleural effusion on his left side; 1.8
liters were removed and the pleural fluid was consistent with
a transudative fluid.

The pleural total protein to serum protein was less than 0.5.
The pleural LDH to serum LDH was less than 0.6.  There were
111 white cells, 2500 red cells and less than 6 protein.  The
patient also had been on Captopril for hypertension and the
Captopril was held for systolic blood pressures in the 90s.

During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, the patient was noted
to have had a decrease in his hematocrit which required
approximately four units of blood over a period of about four
days.  The patient was noted to have had clots removed during
suctioning from his trachea.  The patient also had guaiac
positive stools.  It was felt at that time that the bleeding
was occurring from the fistulas which previously had been
bleeding.

The patient also had an episode of acute renal failure with
creatinine rising from his baseline of approximately 0.7 to
3.2.  It was felt that the renal failure that he was
experiencing was acute renal failure secondary to
hypoperfusion causing acute tubular necrosis.  The
renal failure is resolving. In addition, we are
continuing to follow the hematocrit which has been stable.

The patient also was seen by Psychiatry for agitation and
depression.  Psychiatry felt that the agitation may be
secondary to delirium and the decision was made at that time
to decrease the patient's Paxil dose.  In addition, standing
doses of Haldol were added to the patient's regimen for
agitation.

The patient, in addition, had a bronchoscopy on [**2153-5-22**], for an episode of bleeding mentioned earlier at that
time.  Normal mucosa was noted with clots in the left base
and a left lower lung basilar segment.  An adherent clot was
noted in basilar segment.  Attempts to clear it were
unsuccessful so could not exclude endobronchial lesion distal to
the clot.

Throughout the admission, we continued to wean the patient
from his ventilator with Trache mask trials.

Also of note, please note that the patient's Captopril doses
had been held while the patient had been in acute renal
failure.

In summary, this is an 85 year old male with a history of
laryngeal cancer with a oral cutaneous fistula with bleeding
from the fistula.  The patient also has a history of aortic
valve replacement which, per family discussion, is not being
anti-coagulated with Coumadin, given the high risks of
possible re-bleeding.
