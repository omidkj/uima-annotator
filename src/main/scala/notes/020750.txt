CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cough and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 32 year-old male with
a history of Down Syndrome, autism and [**2097**] pneumonia
complicated with ARDS who presents with one day of productive
cough and low grade fever as well as yellowish nasal
discharge for the past few days.  The patient was prescribed
Doxycycline outpatient and took only two tablets before
refusing to take anymore.  He then became short of breath.
The patient has had some fatigue and anorexia for the past
couple of days.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or
diarrhea.  The patient generally gets an infection once every
two to three months especially infection of the sinuses,
which is treated with Amoxicillin.  He is hospitalized back
in [**10-3**] to [**2098-11-4**] for similar symptoms, which progressed
to ARDS.  At that time he was treated with Cefuroxime,
Clindamycin and Erythromycin.  He was intubated at that time
for 27 days.  In the Emergency Room his saturation was low to
mid 90s on 80% on room air and 94 to 95% on a nonrebreather.

ALLERGIES:  Haldol, prolonged QT, benzodiazepines and
narcotics, positive to severe hypertension.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  None.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cataracts bilaterally status post
surgery.  Downs and autism with mental age level of 4 years
old, recurrent sinusitis.  History of pneumonia in [**2097**]
complicated by ARDS.  [**2099**] tetanus and pneumovax vaccination
with a negative PPD at that time.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He does not smoke or drink.  He lives with
his parents.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Pulse 119.  Blood
pressure 113/61.  Respiratory rate 24.  Temperature 103.  94%
on a nonrebreather.  Generally, this is an agitated male who
is breathing with much effort.  HEENT pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Oropharynx is
difficult to examine.  There is no sinus tenderness.  Neck is
supple.  Chest there are rhonchi bilaterally.  No wheezes or
crackles noted.  There is some nasal flaring and use of
abdominal muscles to breath.  Cardiovascular regular rate and
rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, obese, which is nontender with decreased
bowel sounds.  Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 5.7, 79.3%
neutrophils, 10.6% lymphocytes, 7.5% monocytes, 0.6%
eosinophils and 2% basophils.  Hemoglobin is 14.3, hematocrit
42.1, platelet 208, sodium 144, potassium 4.7, chloride 103,
bicarb 31, BUN 17, creatinine 1.4, glucose 128, INR 1.3, PTT
28.8.  Chest x-ray on [**8-15**] shows no signs of pneumonia and
chest x-ray on [**8-16**] showed prominent pulmonary vasculature.
Blood cultures are pending.  Arterial blood gas, which is
polyvenous had a pH of 7.33, PCO2 60, PO2 48% and this is
done while on 85% on room air.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Respiratory:  The patient had hypoxia
and probable hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
tracheal bronchitis and mucous plugging.  The patient was
treated with antibiotics and given Albuterol Atrovent
nebulizer to improve the breathing.  He was given a
nonrebreather, but could not tolerate it.  The patient was
switched over to 8 liters of oxygen on nasal cannula.  The
patient then was able tolerate the nonrebreather for a couple
of hours before needing to switch over to a simple mask.  The
patient began to have low oxygen saturations and required
intubation.  However, the patient's family decided to have
his code status switched from full code to DNR/DNI so the
patient was not intubated.  The patient became progressively
more hypoxic until he expired.  On the second day of
hospitalization the patient's respiratory distress was
further complicated with mucous plugging that caused right
upper lobe collapse.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was tachycardic upon
admission secondary to dehydration so he was given 125 cc an
hour of D5 half normal saline.  His tachycardia did resolve
transiently until he became quite anxious in the Intensive
Care Unit.  He then became tachycardic secondary to anxiety.

3.  Renal:  He had some prerenal azotemia due to dehydration
with a creatinine of 1.4.  We did hydrate him with D5 half
normal saline.

4.  Infectious disease:  In regards to tracheal bronchitis,
he was given empiric treatment with Levaquin 500 mg
intravenous q.d. and Ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenous q.d.
However, his right middle lobe opacity did not improve.  The
patient also had sinusitis, which was treated with the
antibiotics, saline nasal spray and a 45 degree bed position.

On [**2103-8-19**] Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 3794**] expired at 9:05 a.m. due to
respiratory arrest secondary to pneumonia and lung collapse
that is secondary to mucous plugging.
