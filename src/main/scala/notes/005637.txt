abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42484**] is a 80 year old man with Crohn's disease s/p recent
laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, and ileocecectomy with end
ileostomy on [**2167-3-12**] for small bowel obstruction and anastamotic
stricture.  He was discharged to rehab on [**3-17**] after return of
bowel function, tolerating a regular diet, on a steroid taper.
He remained at rehab until today when he began having increasing
abdominal pain after eating a large breakfast.  He denies nausea
and continued to have ileostomy output.  He was taken to
[**Hospital 26380**] Hospital where a CT scan showed a small amount of free
intraabdominal air. He was reportedly hypotensive at the OSH.
He was transferred to our ED for further evaluation. Upon
arrival, his blood pressure was initially 86/58 however
subsequently improved with a SBP in the 110s. Upon evaluation in
the ED he actually reports the pain has improved somewhat.

CT abd [**4-2**]: IMPRESSION:
1. 16 mm splenic artery pseudoaneurysm with focus of mural
calcification.
2. Multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections which contain foci
of gas with rim enhancement. Findings may be simply secondary to
irrigation following laparotomy; however, intra-abdominal fluid
collections or abscesses could have a similar appearance.
3. Unusual linear hyperdense focus in the third part of duodenum
is of
uncertain etiology but appears intraluminal and likely
represents an ingested material.
4. satisfactory appearance following extended cecectomy and end
ileostomy. Mild ileal mural thickening is suggestive of an
enteritis but may be secondary to ongoing intra-abdominal
inflammation.
5. Diverticulosis, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis at
this time.
6. Small abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.2 cm.

CT abd [**4-7**]:
1. The intra-abdominal abscess is overall of similar volume
compared to
[**2167-4-2**], although the shape is variable. A tiny fluid tracks
to the right upper quadrant with small foci of free air adjacent
to the gallbladder, unchanged.
2. Gallbladder distention, with nonspecific wall stranding in
the setting of anasarca. Distention is similar to [**2167-3-10**] but
increased from [**2167-4-2**].  If clinically indicated, HIDA could
be performed for further evaluation.
3. Abdominal aortic aneurysm to 3.1 cm is unchanged. Marked
stenosis of the celiac artery origin and mild stenosis of SMA
origin due to atherosclerotic plaque.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions are increased from [**2167-4-2**].

Brief Hospital Course:
80M w/ Crohn's disease s/p ileocecectomy for stricture and
enteroenteric fistula, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with a lactate of 4, a
dirty U/A, and intraabdominal abscesses on CT abd. He was
admitted to the ICU for aggresive fluid resuscitation. Over the
course of his three days in the TICU he was administered 10 L
crystalloid and albumin. His lactate improved and pressors were
weaned. He was started on IV vanco and zosyn. IR was consulted
for possible drainage of his multiple intraabdominal abscesses
but it was determined initially that the abscesses were not
amenable to drainage. A discussion was had with the patient's
HCP regarding operative washout but the family decided against
surgical intervention. Given his improved exam, laboratory
values and stable hemodynamics, he was transferred to the floor
on [**2167-4-5**] tolerating sips of fluids.

On the floor maintenance IV fluids were continued and he
remained hemodynamically stable. He remained afebrile and his
WBC count trended downward to normal. However, he continued to
have decreased oral intake and leukocytosis and so a repeat CT
scan was obtained on [**4-7**] to assess whether the prior noted
fluid collections would be amenable to drainage. However, the
collections again were determined to not be amenable to
drainage. Therefore, his IV antibiotics were continued but
changed to cipro and flagyl for empiric coverage of his
abscesses. A CVL in his right IJ had been placed on admission,
and was removed on [**2167-4-8**]. A PICC line was inserted at that
time with a plan for a 2 week total course of IV cipro/flagyl.

His diet was slowly advanced as tolerated. Nutritional
supplements were added to his diet. He was able to tolerate a
regular diet without nausea/vomiting or abdominal pain. His home
medications were resumed at that time and IV hydrocortisone was
discontinued and his PO prednisone taper was resumed per GI
recommendations from prior admission for management of Crohn's.
As his oral intake increased, his ileostomy output was noted to
increase as high as 2 liters per day. On [**4-10**] he was started on
loperamide for this. He also required daily repletions of his
electrolytes.

His urine culture from admission return as MRSA. He had received
4 days of vancomycin coverage for this prior to his antibiotics
being changed to cipro/flagyl. A foley catheter was inserted on
admission given aggressive resuscitation and need for urine
output monitoring. It was removed on [**4-8**]; however, he failed to
void and the foley was replaced for urinary retention.

He was encouraged to mobilize out of bed and ambulated as
tolerated with a walker, with which he required assistance.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation who recommended
discharge to rehab when medically stable. He was started on SC
heparin for DVT prophylaxis. His pain level was routinely
assessed and well-controlled with tylenol.

Of note, pt's INR was elevated on admission and throughout his
hospital course  (1.7-2.4). This was thought to be likely due to
malabsportion and poor nutrition, and he was given IV vitamin K
2 mg X 2 and his INR
