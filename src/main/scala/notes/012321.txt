Date of Birth:  [**2049-3-11**]             Sex:   F

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Upper GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of Right Femoral Cordis

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 y.o. female with h/o duodenal adenocarcinoma
(dx in [**2-14**] @[**Hospital1 112**]) h/o epidoses of hematemesis, h/o CAD s/p
stent placement, ?h/o esophageal cancer? per nursing home
records but not found in records from [**Hospital6 **], who
presents from a nursing home after an episode of hematemesis.
In the ED she was found to be hypotensive to 74/42, tachy to
120s and HCT = 23. She was given protonix 40 mg IV x T, IVF, R
fem cordis placed, transfused 1 unit then transferred to the
MICU. Of note her ECG in the ED demonstrated ST depressions in
leads V2 and V3. Upon transfer to the MICU the patient was
tachycardic to 110s, SBPs = 90-120. An NGT was placed and NG
lavage produced blood which did not clear even after lavaging
with 1L.

Past Medical History:
PMH:
1. h/o duodenal dysplasia then found to have duodenal adenoCA
diagnosed at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**2-14**]. Not a surgical candidate
2. NSTEMI in [**7-12**] with EF = 60% on echo in [**2121**] with RVH and
depressed RVEF
3. Diabetes.
4. Chronic atrial flutter (times 10 years).
5. Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2107**] with
residual facial droop.
6. Hypertension.
7. Status post herniorrhaphy.
8. Status post bladder surgery.


Social History:
Shx:
Patient currently lives at [**Location 1188**] house where she was
transferred to a hospice program but remains full code. She used
to live with her daughter, grandaughter, [**Name2 (NI) 802**] who is pregnant
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 51857**] Project in a 2 bedroom appt.  The appartment is
in her grandmother's name and no one else is on the lease.  On a
more emotional level her daughter (HCP) would like her mother to
meet her unborn baby.  Apparently when she was well, her mother
stated that she wants to live at all cost and her daughter
believes that she is not in her right mind because she is so
tired because of her illness.


Family History:
Brother with heart disease.


Physical Exam:
Vitals: Tm = 99.2, HR = 90s-112, currently 102, BP =
90-120/60-80,
Gen: Thin elderly female, NAD, A&O 3. Can state name of of
president.
CV: tachy, nml S1, S2, no m/r/g
Lungs: CTAB
Abd: soft, nt, guaic negative brown stool.
Extremities: R femoral cordis in place. No other access besides
cordis.


Pertinent Results:
Admission CXRay:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with congestive heart failure.
2. Interval opacity in left lower lung zone; underlying effusion
or consolidation cannot be ruled out. Ideally, a PA and lateral
chest radiograph should be obtained for complete evaluation.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2122-9-5**] 8:57 AM

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT CHEST W/CONTRAST

Reason: HEMATEMESIS, ESOPHAGEAL CA, HYPOTENSION, ? BLEED, ? MASS
Field of view: 32 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old woman with hx of esophageal CA p/w hematemesis,
hypotension.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
IV contrast eval for bleed.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Esophageal cancer and hematemesis. Evaluate for
hemorrhage and metastatic disease.

COMPARISON: CTA of the chest dated [**2121-9-1**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the chest, abdomen,
and pelvis were obtained following the administration of 150 cc
of Optiray contrast. As the patient was actively bleeding from
the upper GI tract, the referring service requested no oral
contrast.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no pathologically
enlarged axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes that are
definitely identified. There is some soft tissue density in the
subcarinal region, but a discrete lymph node is not definitely
identified. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, and the
left pleural effusion tracks medially with a small amount of
low-attenuating fluid surrounding the descending thoracic aorta.
Within the left lung apex, there is a 4 mm nodule which is new
compared to the prior study of [**2121-8-10**]. No additional lung
nodules are identified. There are no consolidations. There is
bilateral minimal dependent atelectasis associated with the
small pleural effusions. There is no pericardial effusion. The
central airways are patent. A small lymph node is noted at the
gastroesophageal junction, measuring 7 mm in short axis
dimension.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, pancreas and
adrenal glands are normal. The gallbladder is somewhat
distended. There is relative low attenuation that is ill defined
in the inferior aspect of the spleen, which is nonspecific. The
kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete normally. There is a
rounded hypoattenuating lesion on the lower pole of the right
kidney measuring 2.8 x 3.1 cm. It likely represents a cyst, as
it measures 8.7 Hounsfield units. The stomach contains a fair
amount of mixed attenuation material with air. The small bowel
is not dilated. The colon is unremarkable. The aorta is of
normal caliber, and the celiac, SMA, renal arteries and proximal
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent. There is atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta.
Small retrocrural lymph nodes are noted, which do not meet CT
criteria for pathologic enlargement. They measure approximately
6-7 mm in short axis dimension. Small mesenteric lymph nodes are
noted that do not meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement
as well.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid, and
uterus are normal. There is a Foley catheter within the bladder,
with associated air. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or
inguinal lymph nodes.

BONE WINDOWS: There is a small amount of cystic change with
associated sclerosis of the right ilial portion of the superior
sacroiliac joint, likely degenerative. No other osseous lesions
are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. No areas of active extravasation. There is a fair amount of
mixed attenuation material within the stomach.
2. A 7-mm lymph node at the gastroesophageal junction and small
retrocrural lymph nodes. While these small lymph nodes do not
meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement, attention on
follow-up studies is recommended to evaluate for interval growth
and evaluation of possible metastases.
3. New 4 mm nodule within the left lung apex.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Coronary artery calcifications and calcification of the
abdominal aorta.

Admission ECG:


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 73 y. o. female with h/o CAD, s/p stent, h/o duodenal
cancer, h/o admissions with UGI bleed p/w UGI bleed.
UGI bleed:
We thought that her hematemesis was most likely secondary to her
duodenal cancer. We obtained records from [**Hospital1 756**] which clearly
demonstrated that she had not been considered to be a candidate
for surgery and she had refused chemotherapy.  She is s/p
radiation therapy which she completed in 04/[**2122**]. A CT scan was
obtained which did not demonstrate an acute GI process. She was
then aggressively transfused and her HCT remained stable. The
case was discussed with GI who thought that an EGD would offer
little therapeutic benefit and in light of the risks associated
with the procedure an EGD was not performed. Her HCT remained
stable and thus her diet was advanced to CLD.  She was continued
on a proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **].
*
ECG changes:
The patient remained chest pain free and cardiac ischemia was
ruled out by serial flat cardiac enzymes. She was not given an
aspirin in light of her risk of bleeding and she continued on a
statin.
*
FEN:
She was initially NPO and then her diet was slowly advanced to
clear liquids.  Her potassium and magnesium were repleted. Her
sodium was elevated on the day of discharge and she was
encouraged to drink fluids to correct her sodium. Her free water
deficit was calculated to be 1L.
*
Prophylaxis:
She was continued on a proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **], compression
boots, subpx: PPI IV bid
