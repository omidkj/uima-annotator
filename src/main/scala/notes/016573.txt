   [**Name (NI) **] husband had been noticing elevated glucoses at home
and had been communicating with PCP over phone about elevated
levels over previous days.  Patient had labs drawn the morning
before arrival in ED, which showed a glucose of 400 and an anion
gap.

   Of note, patient recently admitted in [**Month (only) 404**] for an above
knee, right leg amputation due to an infected ulcer, discharged
to [**Hospital3 **], and most recently living at home.  She was
readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in late [**Month (only) 404**] for two days for R-sided
chest pain, ?thought [**1-5**] to VATs procedure, started on lidoderm

pneumonia and labs showed a normal anion gap.  Three peripheral
IVs were placed and patient given a dose of levaquin, ctx, and
flagyl for community acquired vs. aspiration pneumonia.  Given
vancomycin for unsure reason.  She transiently dropped her
pressures to the 80s, which responded with fluids, receiving 4L

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2199-1-21**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

                              SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in
MCG/ML

PANOREX FILMS [**1-21**]:
HISTORY:  Dental pain.
FINDINGS:  No previous images.  Panorex image shows extensive
metallic dental work in the remaining teeth.  No convincing
evidence of osteomyelitis.

CHEST CT WITH CONTRAST: [**2199-1-16**]
TECHNIQUE:  COPD, interstitial lung disease, left upper lobe
pneumonia and
evidence of loculated pleural effusion concerning for empyema.

TECHNIQUE:  MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images
through the chest after uneventful administration of 70 mL of
Optiray IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformats were obtained.  This
study was compared with [**2198-4-27**], [**11-22**]. [**2197**],
[**2198-11-28**], [**2198-12-2**], and [**2198-12-24**] chest
CT scans.

FINDINGS:  The left upper lobe consolidation is worse since the
[**2198-12-24**] study, with central gas and low density that
likely represents a
necrotizing component (series 4, image 21).  The left lower lobe
consolidation is probably similar to the
