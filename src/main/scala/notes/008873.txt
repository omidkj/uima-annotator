Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**] is an 82 y/o lady with a history of severe aortic
stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7, transvalvular peak gradient 77mmHg, mean
54mmHg on echo from [**7-/2121**]), ulcerative colitis, breast cancer
in [**2109**], presented to ED on [**2121-8-20**] with worsening dyspnea, SOB,
dry cough, chills, and a fast heart rate. Over the past 2 weeks
she has been having worsening SOB and orthopnea. She denies
chest pain, syncope, or edema. No sick contacts or recent
hospital admissions.
.
She was diagnosed with moderate AS in [**2118**], she saw her
cardiologist in [**6-/2121**] for occasional shortness of breath with
exertion (ie climbing an incline with groceries). Repeat echo
showed severe AS (valve area 0.7) and mild AR. She had follow up
appt with cardiologist recently where findings from echo were
reviewed. At that appt, she was noted to have frequent PACs and
there was concern that this may be precurser for A fib. He
recommended cardiac surgery evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 101.4, HR 58, 117/54, RR 20,
97%2L
Labs and imaging significant for: WBC 13.4, HCT 34, PLT 580,
lactate 1.0.  She received Levofloxacin 750mg and tylenol
1000mg.  CXR significant for LUL and RLL pneumonia and
hyperexpanded lungs consistent with underlying emphysema.
Vitals on transfer to unit were Temp 36.9 P 134, BP 125/78, RR
29 92% on 3 L
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
syncope or presyncope.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**7-/2121**]):
CONCLUSIONS
1. Frequent atrial premature beats.
2. There is mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
3. Tissue and transmitral Doppler demonstrate pseudonormal
filling (moderate grade II diastolic dysfunction).
4. The left atrial volume is moderately increased.
5. There is severe aortic stenosis present, with a calculated
valve area of 0.7cm2.
6. Compared with the findings of the prior report of [**6-/2121**],
the measured gradients are a little higher, resuling in a
slightly lower calculated aortic valve area.
.
ECHO [**8-22**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal/small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 60%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.5 cm2) (may represent an entity known as "low flow/low
gradient aortic stenosis with preserved ejection fraction").
Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the
tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
82F history of critical aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7, transvalvular
peak gradient 77mmHg, mean 54mmHg on echo from [**7-/2121**]), IBD,
breast cancer in remission, presenting with SOB, found to have
new atrial fibrillation with RVR, hypotension, and pneumonia.
.
# Pneumonia: Shortness of breath with decreased O2 sat at 88%,
fever (Tmax of 101.4) and chest x-ray consistent with LUL PNA.
Initially thought to be community-acquired PNA.  However,
patient continued to be hypoxic after treatment with
levofloxacin.  Therefore, pulmonology was consulted, and they
recommended broadening with vancomycin and cefepime, which were
eventually stopped.  On [**8-28**], she completed an 8-day course of
levofloxacin for CAP.  Sputum and blood cultures did not grow
any organisms.
.
# New AFIB with RVR: Etiology was thought to be pneumonia or
valvular (aortic) disease.  Given hypotension, diltiazem and
metoprolol were not in itially considered, and she was started
on amiodarone with an understanding of the thromboemobl
