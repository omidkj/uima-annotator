History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 51 y.o male with h.o colon cancer widely mets to lungs
s/p ileostomy, mucous fistula, transferred from [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital for further eval. Per report, pt noticed clogging,
cloudy outpt from his urostomy tubes 1-2 days ago and 1 episode
of vomiting. He also reportedly denied change in ileostomy
outpt, but was noted to have cloudy outpt from his R.nephrostomy
tube.
.
While at [**Name (NI) 1562**], pt noted to have dirty u/a. Afeb, BP 128/68,
HR 120's, sat 96% on RA at ~9am. Upon transfer was noted to have
BP 84/54, HR 113, sat 100% on 2L. CXR with "L.sided white out".

.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals T-99.4, 95/61, hr 121, 16, 100% on
2L-cold, clammy on presentation. On exam decreased bowel sounds
on L.side. The patient's abdomen was non-tender, non-distended,
and had b/l nephrostomy tubes with cloudy/turbid outpt.

Upon transfer to the MICU the patient was started on
phenylephrine for pressor support briefly. His coverage was
broadened to cefepime/vanc/cipro. The patient mental status and
hemodynamics improved. Discussions with the patient and sister
resulted in a DNR/DNI discussion. As the patient is now stable
with a diagnosis of urosepsis, organism to be determined he is
called out to the medical floor.
.
At the time of transfer to the general medicine floors, the
patient is resting comfortably with pain controlled. He is
concerned about the cleanliness of his enviroment and the
temperature of his new room.
.

Imaging:

CT of the chest/pelvis/abdomen ([**2101-9-15**]):
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A left subclavian catheter
terminating
in the right atrium is noted. There is no axillary, mediastinal,

supraclavicular adenopathy. There is an 8 mm right thyroid lobe
nodule. The patient LUL collapse with a left hilar mass. There
are multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, consistent with known
history of malignancy, metastatic lung cancer. Evaluation of
hilar structures is limited given lack of IV contrast, however,
there is fullness adjacent to the left upper lobe bronchus with
suggestion of a mass measuring 1.9 x 2.6 cm, may relate to
patient's known malignancy (2:19). There are innumerable
bilateral pulmonary nodules, largest in the right lower lobe,
measuring 2.3 x 1.3 cm and 2.0 x 1.9 cm. There are bilateral
pleural effusions. There is right lower lobe consolidation may
reflect atelectasis given enhancement.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Livery demonstrates fatty

infiltration. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas are within
normal limits. The right adrenal demonstrates a mass, measuring
2.1 x 1.6 cm, suspicious for adrenal metastases. There are
multiple mesenteric lymph nodes, in the
gastrosplenic ligament, measuring up to 1.2 cm and may reflect
metastatic
nodes. The patient has an indwelling vena caval filter. There
are bilateral nephrostomy tubes. The right kidney is otherwise
unremarkable. The leftkidney demonstrates mild hydronephrosis
and hydroureter, could be due to clogged PCN tube, which is
appropriately positioned in the renal pelvis. There is no
intraperitoneal free fluid or free air.

There is a left paramedian colostomy. There is a right lower
quadrant
ileostomy. Small amount of contrast is noted in the small bowel.


CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is marked soft
tissue thickening and fullness in the deep pelvis effacing the
normal fat planes and limiting differentiation between bladder,
prostate and residual rectum. It extends from the sacral
promontry to the pubic symphysis. There is no inguinal or
pelvicsidewall adenopathy. The largest inguinal lymph node on
the right measures up to 1 cm.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no osteolytic or osteosclerotic
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Innumerable pulmonary nodules, right adrenal metastases,
mesenteric nodes, pelvic soft tissue mass, left peri hilar mass,
and left upper lobe collapse, findings consistent with
metastatic lung cancer.
2. A hydronephrotic left kidney with percutaneous nephrostomy
tube in situ
and moderate left hydronephrosis and hydroureter possibly due to

compression/infiltration from the pelvic mass and clogged PCN
tube.
3. Bilateral Pleural effusions and RLL atelectasis.
4. Fatty Liver

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Pt is a 51 y.o male with h.o colon ca who
presents with hypotension found to have sepsis due to UTI.
.
1. Sepsis due to UTI: The patient was stabilized in the ICU with
IV fluids and broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin,
Zosyn, and Cipro. Repeat lactates were normal. Although his
SBP~80, the patient was mentating well initially, but
