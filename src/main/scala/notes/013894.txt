Chief Complaint:
right breast infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right breast expander removal and wound drainage


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 17684**] is a 51-year-old Caucasian female who underwent
immediate right breast reconstruction in [**2114-11-19**] using a
[**Hospital 17686**] medical
expander following a right mastectomy for breast cancer.
Postoperatively, she had developed some ecchymosis and
blistering at the margins of the incision line, and this was
treated conservatively with a topical antibiotic regimen.
These areas eventually demarcated over a [**2-20**] week period with
evidence for full-thickness skin loss.  Additionally, the
patient had some inflammatory hyperemia and early cellulitis
that had been treated with oral antibiotics.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drain which had been placed at the time of surgery was draining
straw-colored serous fluid, but the patient reported more
copious drainage over the past few days, with much of it
emerging from the separating wound eschar.

Although Mrs. [**Known lastname 17684**] denied any fevers, chills, or other
systemic symptoms, the persistent fluid collection with skin
cellulitis, in the presence of a prosthetic implant with
compromised skin integrity, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3228**] decided to take the
patient to
the operating room for wound debridement, as well as removal
of the expander implant.
