Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o male about 2 years out from liver transplant with
multiple issues upon admission.
Patient profoundly weak and emaciated with history of severe
diarrhea, poor PO intake, dehydration. It was determined that
the patient was a candidate for a PEG tube which was placed by
Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**]. Due to concerns for malabsorption the patient
was initially started on Vivonex, an elemental formula.
GI service performed EGD and colonoscopy and found fatty stool,
and concern was raised for pancreatic insufficiency. A stool
elastase was sent off which was negative. GI mucosal path was
normal.
The renal team was consulted for acute on chronic renal failur.
He was started on bicarbonate. Likely due to RTA.
Anemia of chronic disease treated with continued epogen and
started iron supplementation.
A cardiology consult was obtained. Echo in the past showed an EF
of around 50%. An ECHO was performed and he was found to have :
Severe regional and global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Regional right ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate secondary mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-6-3**],
biventricular systolic function has significantly deteriorated,
with probable interim inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
Severity of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension has
increased.
Treatment was limited by concurrent renal failure and an ACE/[**Last Name (un) **]
could not be started at this time. He was maintain on beta
blocker and ASA. Further evaluation at this time was not
undertaken (stress) but will be followed up as an outpatient.
When he was initially admitted from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, it was
thought he had a RLL pneumonia. He was started on Levaquin. CT
done on HD 8 showed Heterogeneous perfusion in the liver with
large bilateral pleural  effusions, cardiomegaly, and small
amount of ascites are compatible with right heart
failure/hepatic congestion.
The levaquin was d/c following a 10 day course. Pulmonary
consult did not recommend thoracentesis at that time. Pneumonia
prophylaxis complete.
C Diffs had been sent and were negative. Immodium was started
with some relief of the diarrhea. Creon was started on the
advice of the hepatology teasm due to findings of fatty stool.
This in combination with the immodium reduced the stool output
grewatly and in fact the immodium was held for several days
awaiting return of stool. He will remain on the creon as an
outpatient and use the immodium PRN as stooling dictates.
On HD 11, the patient had increased complain of SOB and became
quite anxious. His SaO2 dropped into the 70's and an xray
confirmed worsening pulmonary edema. He was transferred to the
SICU. He was diuresed with excellent results. Cardiology did not
feel this was an acute ischemic event. Using Esmolol briefly and
good diuresis with Lasix he continued to improve his respiratory
status, returned to his best weight of around 44 kg and was able
to be [**Last Name (un) 72013**] transferred back to regular surgical floor.
Serial chest xrays showed resolution of the pulmonary edema. He
is started on Lasix 40 PO daily and will continue this at home.
Tuibe feedings were changed to nutren pulmonary and he did not
have return of diarrhea. He will be discharged to home on this
formula via the PEG tube.
Alk phos took a slight increase to 270. Liver ultrasound showed
concern for some biliary dilitation. However the alk phos was
[**Last Name (un) 7162**] trending down and although an ERCP was considered, it was
not pursued at this time.
One final note on CT of abdomen. a newly apparent 5-mm
arterially enhancing focus in segment IV was seen. For now this
will be followed as an outpatient with no current intervention
planned.
Patient is discharged to home with tube feeds via PEG, Lasix
daily with instructions to weigh daily. Monitor also for return
of diarrhea. He will follow up with cardiology as an otpatient
and may do this with a cardiologist on [**Location (un) **] as desired with
the month.
Some adjustments were made to immunosuppression while in house.
These are reflected in OMR.
