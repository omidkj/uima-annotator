Chief Complaint:
Cough, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year old gentleman with h/o CAD, DM2, HTN, hep C
who presents with 4 days of productive cough and shortness of
breath.  He reports that beginning 4 days ago, he developed
cough productive of yellow/brown sputum which has worsened over
this time period.  He notes shortness of breath worsening in
this setting.  He endorses chills, but denies subjective fevers.
 He also reports anterior chest pain with coughing and worse
with deep inspiration.
.
In addition, over the past several days he has had profuse
watery diarrhea which has slowed yesterday and no episodes
today.  He reports he noted "specks of blood" in his stool when
the diarrhea was heavy.  He reports stool was dark in color, not
black; he has not been taking his iron.  He also reports N/V and
throwing up "black specks", no bright red blood, but this too
has resolved.  He denies abdominal pain.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.7 P 108 BP 100/60 RR 20 O2 sat
85%RA-->100%NRB.  CXR demonstrated a diffuse patchy opacity in
the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia with a possible
second focus of pneumonia at the left lung base versus
atelectasis.  There was also question of accompanying right
parapneumonic effusion.  On exam he had guaic negative brown
stool.  He received 2L NS and 1L  with 40meq KCL.  Additionally,
he received 750mg IV levofloxacin.  He was written for 40meq PO
KCL x2, but he did not tolerate the doses.
.
On arrival to the ICU, he says he still feels SOB, but improved.
 He c/o CP with cough and deep inspiration.  He reports his
neuropathy is "awful" and requests his pain medications.
.

wheezes, rales, rhonchi.
CV: Borderline sinus tachy, no mrg appreciated.

Pertinent Results:
[**2176-12-20**] CXR:  A diffuse patchy opacity in the right lower lobe
consistent with pneumonia. There may be a second focus of
pneumonia at the left lung base versus atelectasis. Question
likely accompanying right parapneumonic effusion.
.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 103.  Wavy baseline, but
has TW flattening in III, aVF.  TWI in V1 (old), TW flattening
in V2.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o M with DM, sleep apnea, admitted with nausea and CA
pneumonia, developed aspiration pneumonia and then ventilator
associated pneumonia.
.
MICU COURSE
Mr. [**Known lastname **] returned to the micu after initially being treated for
a MSSA CAP and MSSA bacteremia, for which he was receiving a
planned course of nafcillin until [**2177-1-2**]. the reason for
re-admission to the ICU was an aspiration event. He required
intubation due to hypoxemia and developed ARDS. Has was
supported with mechanical ventilation and slowly recovered,
getting extubated on [**2175-12-31**]. He did have some hypotension while
intubated, presumed due to sedating medications. He was
pancultured to rule out sepsis. One blood culture out of two
from [**12-31**] returned with GPCs, presumed contaminant. Nonetheless,
given that he was low grade febrile and had a slight WBC count,
his nafcillin was braodened to vanco and zosyn. This was
narrowed back to just vancomycin on [**2177-1-2**], with a plan to d/c
all antibiotics in 48-72 hours if surveillence cultures were
negative. during his MICU course he was noted to occasionally
have some loose guaiac positive diarrhea but never required
transfusion.
.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient was admitted to the ICU with
community-acuqired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis. There
was some concern that he might be developing a
ventilator-acquired pneumonia, however pulmonary function has
been improving. Legionella and flu studies negative. Sputum
culture showed MSSA and he completed 12 days of gram positive
coverage. He completed 11 days of GP/GN coverage following
aspiration event. Positive blood cultures were likely a
contaminant. He did have a spike in WBC on [**12-31**] that has been
trending down. He has had chest discomfort with deep inspiration
and with coughing. He continues to have LLL and RUL
opacifications on CXR, with developing RLL consolidation. He was
evaluated by speach and swallow on [**2176-1-1**] who found him to be
unsafe to take PO. Since then, he was reevaluated. Diet was
advance and he tolerated a ground consistency, thin liquid diet
without further aspiration. He was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for 8
day course from [**12-31**] to [**1-7**] for VAP.  After starting this
antibiotic course, he was afebrile with normal WBC.  He was
weaned to 3 L/min O2.
.
NAUSEA: Patient had nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea on admission
that resolved initially. He was treated with zofran PRN with
good effect. He was on Prilosec as an outpatient, now on
lansoprazole.  Stool was C. diff negative.  He was continued on
a [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  He did not have any [**Doctor First Name **] or bloody stools.
.
TYPE 2 DIABETES: Diet controlled per patient at home.  He was
continued on ISS and Lantus while in house.  His insulin was
discontinued on discharge per request of his PCP.
.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Ischemia ruled out by CE and ECG.  He
was continued on ASA, and statin.
.
CHRONIC PAIN: Mainly in the setting of neuropathy, although it
is unclear if this could be related to his diabetes.  He was
continued on his outpatient pain regimen with duragesic patch,
neurontin, oxycodone prn.  He was not discharged with narcotics
as he already has perscriptions for this from his PCP.
.
LUNG NODULE: He had a lung nodule noted on [**10-2**] CT abd and
appeared more prominent than [**1-/2176**] study measuring 8mm. 6 month
f/u imaging was recommended. Does have possible left lung base
infiltrate as well but mass not visualized on CXR and seems less
likely to represent postobstructive pneumonia.
.
ANEMIA: Baseline hct fluctuates somewhat, but appears most
consistently mid 30s. Low MCV with h/o iron deficiency, but
patient reports he is not taking iron any longer. Iron studies
from [**2174**] c/w Fe deficiency. B12 and folate normal in [**10-2**].
Guaiac negative on exam in the ED. No c-scope in our system
since [**2167**] at which time poor prep, but did not show significant
pathology. Hct has been trending down in ICU. No bloody or
melinotic stools.
- Follow Hct as outpatient, consider for Iron ther
