Chief Complaint:
Hypotension/hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old woman with diabetes, hypertension,
atrial fibrillation, history of C. diff, and vertebral
osteomyelitis who presented with hypotension and hypoxia. She
was recently discharged on [**10-26**] following surgery for her
osteomyelitis. She had been at rehab when she had an episode of
hypotension and hypoxia (low 80's). She was initially seen at an
OSH. She was given metoprolol 50mg PO, lasix 80mg IV and noted
to be hypotensive. A CTA of the chest was negative for PE, but
had bilateral pleural effusions. She was placed on dopamine. She
did not receive IVF. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 96.1 80/palp 90 14 95% on NRB. Right
groin line was placed. She received zosyn in the ED. She was on
vancomycin and flagyl for osteomyelitis and C. diff. Originally,
she was transferred to the CCU out of concern for cardiogenic
shock. She was diuresed, but then stopped making urine. Her
clinical picture was thought to be more representative of
sepsis. She was given fluids and transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, she was briefly on levophed until 8AM this morning.
Of note, she was intubated during an MRI on [**10-29**]. Her SBP has
been maintained in the 100-110s today. She is currently on room
air. Her UOP has improved. FeNa is 0.1%. She is currently
receiving IVFs. An ultrasound revealed cirrhotic liver. A
paracentesis removed 2 L. Blood, urine, peritoneal cultures cxs
are pending. She is currently on vanc/zosyn and flagyl for
history of C. diff.
.
Patient was having episodes of constipation. Now with two bowel
movements today. No complaints of pain, shortness of breath, or
nausea. She states she is feeling much better.

with her husband.  She is now retired but formerly worked in
medical records at [**Hospital **] Hospital.  She denies EtOH, tobacco,

should be.  She reports exercising by doing chores around the
house.

STUDIES:
ECHO ([**2125-10-29**])-
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the distal septum, anterior and inferior
walls. There is a small apical left ventricular aneurysm with
apical akinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF
= 45 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-10-25**],
basal septal and anterior function are improved, but apical
dysfunction is now identified. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is now identified.

[**2125-10-29**] Abdominal U/S- IMPRESSION: Shrunken nodular liver with
diffuse ascites consistent with the provided history of
cirrhosis. The main portal vein is patent. A small echogenic
nodule abutting the capsule is visualized, incompletely
characterized on this study. This lesion may be better evaluated
with multiphasic CT or an MRI of the abdomen if clinically
indicated

[**2125-10-29**] MRI L spine
1. Postsurgical changes with fluid collections related to the
surgical
hardware in the dorsal soft tissues, which may be postoperative
seromas.
Underlying infection would be difficult to entirely exclude.
Corrleate
clinically and with labs.
2. Fluid collection in the left aspect of the retroperitoneum
also may be
postsurgical in nature, although underlying infection in this
location would also be difficult to exclude.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Postcontrast MRI of the lumbar spine would
probably not be helpful given the degree of susceptibility
artifact in the region of the surgical hardware. CT of this
region may be helpful to better assess the surgical hardware and
any enhancement.

[**2125-11-1**] CXR - Left lower lobe sizable atelectasis and pleural
effusion. No acute pulmonary infiltrates. Cardiomegaly as
before.

ECHO ([**2125-11-5**])-
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
inferior wall and the distal half of the anterior septum and
anterior walls, and the apex. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 35 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-10-29**],
left ventricular systolic dyfunction is more extensive and
suggests multivessel CAD (or myocarditis). The severity of
mitral regurgitation is also increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxia:  Patient came in with drastically increased oxygen
requirement.  She was admitted to the CCU and then the MICU with
concerns for cardiogenic shock and sepsis.  She was managed
there initially with diuresis but then fluid administration
given possibility of sepsis.  She was briefly intubated.  Upon
extubation, patient did very well.  She continued to sat well on
room air while here.  She was found to have a left sided pleural
effusion on chest x-ray and was on 2L NC (satting 97% on
discharge).  We checked room air sats also and patient was
satting 96% on RA.  Given stable condition and good saturation
on room air, we did not pursue a
