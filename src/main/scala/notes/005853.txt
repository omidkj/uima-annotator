History of Present Illness:
(history obtained from daughter and chart) Ms. [**Known lastname 32729**] is a
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with COPD, restrictive lung disease [**3-2**]
kyphoscoliosis, OSA, and diastolic CHF,(EF>55%), Afib on
coumadin, multiple hospital admissions, most recently [**2114-9-11**]
for diarrhea and LLE cellulitis, who was admitted from [**Hospital1 **]
with hypoxia and chest pain.
Patient's diet was today advanced from liquids to ground
consistency. It was then noted that her O2 saturation dropped
from the baseline 90s to low 80s on 3L NC. Around 3pm she was
noted to be more sleepy with low UOP (~50cc in AM shift). She
was started on BiPAP and became more responsive. At the same
time she also complained of some chest pain/pressure that per
daughter already had improved before she was given nitro SL. She
was also given solumedrol 125 IV and clorothiazide for low UOP.
In terms of abx, patient was on CTX and azithro (unclear why
azithro) but azithro was d/c'd today and patient was started on
levo/flagyl for suspicion of aspiration PNA. A VBG at 8pm off
BiPAP was 7.38/59/46. She had a (+) U/A with klebsiella and
E.Coli from [**9-12**] and [**9-14**] and was being treated with abx for
that in [**Hospital1 **]. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
management.
.
In the ED, VS 98.4, 73, 140/54, 16, 96% NRB. patient did not
have any CP. Troponin 0.06, ASA was given and levofloxacin for
(+) U/A. O2 Sats leveled off around 90% on 2L NS.
.
At baseline, she is a Co2 retainer with PaCo2 between 50-60, and

baseline bicarb chronically between 35 and 40. She chronically
lives with O2 sat at 88%. She also chronically complains of
being SOB.
.

Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted for hypoxia and altered mental status in
setting of multifactorial progressive underlying cardiovascular
disease (COPD, restrictive disease due to kyphoskoliosis, OSA,
CHF). Her condition continually worsened over her hospital
course such that even on BiPAP patient would be hypercarbic. She
became progressively agitated and confused. Given the very poor
prognosis in terms of etiology for her respiratory status, her
daughter agreed on [**2114-9-30**] to change the goals of care to
'comfort measures only'.
Patient passed on [**2114-10-1**] at 2:30 AM. Daughter and attending were
informed. Daughter declined post-mortem exam.
