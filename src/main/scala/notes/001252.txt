week premature infant, who is ready for discharge home.  This
interim discharge summary covers the period of
hospitalization from [**2189-8-13**] to the time of discharge,
[**2189-10-5**]. For information about the hospital course from birth to
[**2189-8-12**] please see the first interim summary.

Briefly, [**Known lastname 48330**] was born to a 38-year-old gravida 4, para 2,
now 3 woman after progressive preterm labor.  His hospital
course since [**2189-8-13**] by systems:

Respiratory status:  [**Known lastname 48330**] has remained in room air
throughout this time.  He did, however, continue to have
episodes of apnea or bradycardia, some associated with
feeding and some at rest.  He was given a trial of Reglan and
Zantac and caffeine, all with no change in his clinical
presentation.  Pneumogram with pH probe study done on
[**2189-9-17**] showed no prolonged central apnea, no obstructive
apnea, occasional saturation drops to 85-90% with periodic
breathing, rare bradycardic events to 52 to 55 beats per
minute, and no acid reflux.  He was evaluated by [**Hospital3 18242**] ORL team on [**2189-9-23**] and had a flexible fiberoptic
laryngoscopy examination.  That showed some glottic erythema
and edema, and edema of the vocal cords consistent with
esophagitis.  He was then continued on Enfamil added rice
cereal eating at least every four hours for that.

He is being sent home on a cardiac monitor.  His last episode
of bradycardia occurred on [**2189-9-27**].  On examination, his
respirations are comfortable.  His lung sounds are clear and
equal.

Cardiovascular status:  [**Known lastname 48330**] has remained normotensive.  He
has had an intermittent grade 1-2/6 systolic ejection murmur
consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis or patent
foramen ovale.  His last cardiac echocardiogram done on
[**2189-6-8**] revealed a patent foramen ovale and no other
structural anomalies, and no followup is required.

Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition status:  At the time of
discharge, his weight is 4,685 grams, his length is 53 cm,
and his head circumference is 38 cm.  He is eating Enfamil AR
formula taking approximately 140 cc/kg/day eating
every four hours.  He was treated with Calciferol for vitamin
D deficiency manifested by increasing alkaline phosphatase
levels.  He received Calciferol from [**2189-7-30**] to [**2189-9-2**].
His last alkaline phosphatase level on [**8-24**] was 418.  He
does have no radiologic evidence of decreased bone
mineralization.

Endocrine:  [**Known lastname 48330**] was evaluated by [**Hospital3 1810**]
Endocrinology service on [**2189-6-27**] when he had some mildly
decreased T4 levels and a mildly elevated TSH level.  His
last thyroid studies on [**2189-9-10**] were a TSH of 4.0, and a T4
of 7.5.  He was felt to have transient sick euthyroid syndrome.

Gastrointestinal status:  His gastroesophageal reflux issues
were covered in the respiratory section of this summary.  He
did have a bilateral inguinal [**Known lastname 41231**] repair on [**2189-8-13**].  The
sites have healed nicely.

Hematology:  His last hematocrit on [**2189-8-31**] was 33.4 with a
reticulocyte count of 4.1%.  He is receiving supplemental
iron of 2 mg/kg/day.

Neurology:  His last head ultrasound on [**2189-6-29**] was
completely within normal limits.

Sensory:  Audiology:  Hearing screening was performed with
automated auditory brain stem responses and the infant passed
in both ears.

Ophthalmology:  [**Known lastname 48332**] eyes were examined most recently on
[**2189-8-12**] and revealed mature retinal vessels bilaterally.
Follow-up exam is recommended in [**9-1**] months.
