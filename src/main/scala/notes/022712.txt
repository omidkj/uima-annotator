History of Present Illness:
OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD
.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest Pain
.
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
51 M w/ pmh of HTN, CAD s/p STEMI ([**2164**]) s/p stent to RCA BIBA
at around 6am after having chest pain since 2 am. He states that
he was awakened from sleep feeling nauseated w/ substernal chest
pressure radiating down his L arm. Associated w/ L arm numbness.
+ diaphoresis but no SOB. He states that although the pain was
similar to that of his prior MI, he waited to call 911 as the
pain briefly subsided w/ rest. However, when it increased in
intensity again he knew he was having a heart attack. He took
cocaine 48 hrs ago.
.
In the ER, initial vitals: 97.4, 73, 138/87, 100%. Code STEMI
called and sent to cath lab. A thrombus was seen in his mid-RCA
stent. During this time, the patient was hypotensive requiring
dopamine and atropine and then additionally, neosynephrine
support. The patient had 3 runs of sustained VT requiring 3
shocks and started on amio ggt. A IABP was placed and one DES
was placed to his RCA overlapping his previous stent. Also given
lasix 20 mg IV.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative except that he has been having
dry heaves and abdominal pain X 3 days. + chronic fatigue. +
[**6-23**] pound weight gain over the past 3 months. + chronic night
sweats.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea
on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG demonstrated SR (89) w/ PVCs, nl axis, ? LVH, 1mm STE in II,
III, aVF, w/ hyperacute T Waves in V2-V4, Q-waves in II, III,
aVF (all new).
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: afib w/ freq PVCs
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2166-12-1**] demonstrated: EF 60%
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an E/e' <8
suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2166-12-17**] Stress: 47% max HR
INTERPRETATION: This 50 year old man s/p MI [**6-18**] was referred to
the
lab for evaluation prior to knee surgery. The patient was
infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 4 minutes.
During the infusion, the patient noted a progressive substernal
chest tightness [**7-24**]. This resolved within 2 minutes of stopping
the infusion by reversing the dipyridamole with 125 mg of
aminophylline IV. There were no ST segment changes during the
infusion or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with frequent
isolated polymorphic VPBs and occasional ventricular couplets.
One APB was noted during the infusion. Appropriate hemodynamic
response to the study. IMPRESSION: Possible anginal type
symptoms in the absence of ischemic
EKG changes. Nuclear report sent separately.
.
PMIBI performed on [**2166-12-17**] demonstrated:
1. Fixed, small, severe perfusion defect involving the LAD
territory.
2. Fixed, small, moderate severity perfusion defect involving
the PDA territory.
3. Increased left ventricular cavity size. Mild systolic
dysfunction with apical and basal inferior hypokinesis.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2167-2-10**] demonstrated:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated a non-flow limiting CAD. The LMCA was patent. The
LAD had
some mild luminal irregularities. The LCx was patent. There was
a
50-60% stenosis at the lower pole of the OM1. The RCA had a 40%

proximal stenosis. Previously placed RCA stents were widely
patent.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated left sided filling

pressure with an LV
