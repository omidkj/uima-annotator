None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 86 yo female w/ PMhx sig for COPD, CHF, schizophrenia,
dementia, discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday who presents from
rehab unresponsive.  The patient was hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 14195**]
for COPD exacerbation c/b sepsis secondary to diarrhea and
hypovolemia.  She was treated in the ICU and was on
pressors for a period of time.  Her course was also complicated
by hypernatremia requiring free water boluses.  She eventually
stabilized and was d/c back to rehab on levofloxacin and a
steroid taper.
This afternoon in rehab she was found to be unresponsive. She
was brought into [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Previously her code status was DNR/DNI. At the time her
healthcare proxy (son Mr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **]) was contact[**Name (NI) **] from [**Name (NI) **],
he changed code status and wished to intubate patient and pursue
full treatment.  The patient had a GCS of 3 on arrival to the ED
and was intubated.  CT scan of the head showed a large R
hemisphere ICH.
Patient was stabilized at ED and admitted to Neurology ICU
service for further care.

Head CT:
FINDINGS:  There has been interval development of acute large
right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, extending from the basal
ganglia out to the cortex, measuring approximately 10 x 4 cm.
There is extensive surrounding
edema and mass effect on adjacent cortex and the ipsilateral
lateral ventricles, as well as uncal herniation, and
approximately 12 mm of leftward shift of normally midline
structures. Dilatation of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ontralateral
left lateral ventricle suggests compression of the third
ventricle by the hemorrhage and associated edema. There is no
intraventricular blood. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  Acute large 10 x 4 cm right intraparenchymal
hemorrhage and
associated edema causing mass effect on adjacent cortex and
ipsilateral
lateral ventricles, as well as uncal herniation and 12 mm of
leftward shift of normally midline structures.

CXR: 1.  Interval placement of an ET and OG tube, with good
position.
2.  Atelectasis at the left lung base, with likely small
associated pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 86 yo female w/ PMhx sig for COPD, dementia,
schizophrenia recently d/c yesterday from [**Hospital1 18**] for COPD flare
found to be unresponsive at rehabilitation hospital. Head CT
scan shows large R hemisphere ICH.  Neurological exam was
significant for intact brainstem reflexes, L eye deviation,
withdrawal to nailbed pressure of L, minimal on R, b/l upgoing
toes.  From the examination, the location of the hemorrhage
appears cortical/subcortical.  Given her history of dementia,
amyloid angiopathy appears likely.  Other possibilities include
metastatic disease, aneurysm, secondary transformation of an
ischemic stroke.  Eye deviation may represent pressure on L
frontal eye field from midline shift or alternatively seizure.

Patient was admitted to Neurology ICU (SICU) and received
Prednisone taper, Valproic acid. We controlled blood pressure to
achieve SBP<180, MAP<130.
Considering her prognosis, due to location and the size of
hemorrhage, it was considered to be very poor functionally and
mortality wise.
We communicated and kept in touch with her son regarding to her
condition and possible poor outcome.
Her son wished to place her comfortable measures only
considering poor prognosis.
Patient was extubated at 11:45AM. Patient became bradycardic,
apneic and became asystolic. Patient's death was announced on
[**2152-5-4**] 2:45PM.

Death was announced to her health care proxy, son, Mr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **].
New Englan Organ Bank was contact[**Name (NI) **] prior to extubation,
declined the case.
Patient'd death was reported to Medical Examiner, declined the
case.
The family requested to perform autopsy to identify underline
pathology of hemorrhage.
