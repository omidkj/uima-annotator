Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy [**2198-2-7**] - tracheal stent was removed, microtear in

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 51 yo M with a hx of asthma, CAD s/p CABG, DMI,
tracheobronchomalacia, who underwent bronchoscopy with tracheal
stent placement on Monday ([**1-30**]) by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**]. Patient
reports that since that time he has had worsening SOB as well as
back pain and worsened productive cough of mucus (no blood spots
or streaks). He also noted to have a wheezy chest. He called Dr. [**Name (NI) 89545**] office to inform him of these symptoms yesterday and
today, and then proceeded to [**Hospital1 **] ED, where he underwent CT
chest showing pneumomediastinum. He received 3 grams IV unasyn
and 12 mg IV morphine and fluconazole 100mg PO and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.7 100 157/76 18 100% 3L NC, pain
[**3-8**]. Labs were remarkable for leukocytosis to 13.9 with a left
shift. Patient was seen by IP in the ED, with a plan to undergo
bronchoscopy and likely stent removal this evening. He was
admitted to the medicine service for further management. Vitals
on transfer were HR 103, BP 153/85, 100% on 3L.
.
On the floor, his vitals were 101.8, BP 155/70, HR 80, RR 20,
O2Sat%98 on 3L NC. He reported significant diffuse back pain,
7/10 intensity. He also had some mild nausea, but denied SOB,
chest pain, dizziness, abdominal pain.
.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH.  STRAIN 2.
