Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
Liver failure, s/p OLT x2
Respiratory failure
L hemothorax, fibrothorax, trapped lung
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2180-5-1**] Flexible bronchoscopy, left thoracoscopy with removal of
pleural fibrin and blood, left limited thoracotomy with partial
decortication of the left lung.
[**2180-5-18**] Intra-abdominal bleeding from the hepatic artery, s/p
coil embolization of the hepatic artery.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6359**] is a 44 year old gentleman who has had two
orthotopic liver transplantations. He had a difficult
postoperative course, ultimately was in
rehabilitation center where he developed shortness of breath and
a feeling of being unwell. He presented on [**2180-4-27**] and was found
to have a left pleural effusion. A small chest tube was placed
and 200cc bloody serosanguineous fluid was aspirated. Subsequent
CT scan demonstrated that the fluid collection was loculated.
The patient had been intubated due to his respiratory distress.
There were no signs of sepsis. He was taken to the OR on [**2180-5-1**]
for a thoracoscopy to evacuate the pleural fibrin and blood.
During the procedure, it was discaocerd that he had trapped lung
and, therefore, a limited thoracotomy with partial decortication
was performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
After his left thoracotomy for left trapped lung, Mr. [**Known lastname 6359**]
was transferred back to the ICU. His nutritional status was
supported by TPN. He remained on the ventilator for a few days
but could be extubated. However, he decompensated shortly
thereafter and had to be reintubated. On [**5-18**], he developped a
massive GI bleed and he was transported emergently to the cath
lab. A fistula was discovered between the previously stented
hepatic artery/GDA into his GI tract. The hepatic as well as the
gastroduodenal arteries were coiled. Postoperatively, the
bleeding subsided. Mr. [**Known lastname 6359**] received multiple blood products
to maintain his HCT. He remained on the ventilator for
repiratory failure and could not be weaned off. Multiple
discussions were held with the family, who decided to make him
DNR/DNI. After he made no progression over the next days, the
family decided to make him CMO. At this time he was a
non-operative candidate with a large enterocutaneous fistula in
his R abdomen, respiratory failure, intermittent fulminant
GI-bleed and s/p liver transplant.
He expired peacefully with his mother and his aunt at his
bedside on [**2180-5-26**].
