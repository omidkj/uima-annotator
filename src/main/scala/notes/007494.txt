History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year-old female patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**] with a history of cardiomyopathy and worsening
heart failure symptoms,
referred for elective biventricular pacemaker placement.

She has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, with an EF
last measured at 20-30%, thought to be viral in nature. A
cardiac catheterization in [**2174**] revealed clean coronaries. Over
the past year, she reports progressive symptoms of fatigue and
dyspnea with exertion, with SOB after walking from her bedroom
to her bathroom, approximately 15 feet. She has frequent
episodes of PND and has 3-pillow orthopnea. She is now referred
for BIV pacemaker placement.

Of note, she also reports a 2-week history of URI symptoms with
cough productive of small amounts of sputum, + sore throat, no
myalgia/malaise/fever or chills. She was treated with Z-Pack in
the week prior to admission.

Past Medical History:
Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
Hypertension
History of coccidioidomycosis (? Dx in [**2172**])
Left knee surgery [**1-/2173**]
Status post appendectomy
Benign breast mass




Social History:
She lives alone. Her daughter lives nearby.

Family History:

Pertinent Results:
Relevant laboratory data in hospital:

[**2178-1-30**] CXR (portable): The patient is status post dual-chamber
ICD placement, with pacemaker leads terminating in right atrial
appendage and right ventricle. No pneumothorax. Note is made of
cardiomegaly. Note is made of opacity in the left upper lobe,
probably representing pneumonia. No evidence of CHF is noted.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax. Parenchymal opacity
in the left upper lobe, probably representing pneumonia versus
aspiration. Please correlate clinically, and confirm the
resolution after treatment.

******************
[**2178-1-30**] ECHO:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
dilated.
2. There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity is dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is a small pericardial effusion.

******************
[**2178-1-31**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST: A dual-lead cardiac pacer is
present with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
ventricle. There is subcutaneous air adjacent to the pacer,
status-post recent placement.

There is opacity within the left upper lobe. A trace right and
small left pleural effusion are present. The heart size is
markedly enlarged. There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
lymphadenopathy.

There is a 25 x 21 mm heterogeneously enhancing right thyroid
nodule.
Osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION
1. Left lower lobe pneumonia with a small left pleural effusion.
2. Marked cardiomegaly.
3. Right thyroid nodule. A thyroid ultrasound is recommended for
further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year-old female with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF
20%, HTN, LBBB, admitted for elective placement of BiV pacer to
help relieve symptoms of progressive CHF. Her hospital course
will be reviewed by problems.

1) Cardiomyopathy: As mentionned above, patient electively
admitted for BiV pacer placement on [**2178-1-30**]. During the
procedure (prior to lead placement), she began having hemoptysis
with desaturation, but was able to continue and underwent
placement of A+RV leads. Due to difficulty in placing the CS
lead, the procedure was aborted and Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred
to the CCU for close monitoring. See below for work-up of
hemoptysis.

While in the CCU, she was continued on ASA, Digoxin, Coreg
(titrated up to 12.5 mg PO BID), Imdur, Valsartan (titrated up
to 160 mg PO BID), and lasix prn. Lisinopril was discontinued,
as it was felt to possibly contribute to her complaint of
chronic cough. She was also continued on Lipitor. She was
diuresed to optimize her volume status.

She returned to the EP lab on [**2178-2-5**] for percutaneous
placement of the CS lead, which failed secondary to unusual
anatomy. Plan was made to proceed with surgical placement of the
LV lead, which she underwent on [**2178-2-9**] via a left anterior
thoracotomy. She tolerated the procedure well. She was
hypertensive post-procedure, and required a short course of
Nitroglycerin drip in the PACU, weaned to off the following day
with reintroduction of her PO meds. She was diuresed
post-procedure, and standing Lasix 60 mg PO QD was resumed on
POD #1. PT was involved. Weight at discharge is 92.8.

We have arranged for VNA services for monitoring of her weight
and BP. The goal is probably no more than 2 kg weight loss at
home until follow-up next week. She will also need follow-up of
her electrolytes on [**2178-2-16**], especially potassium.

2) Hemoptysis: During the procedure on [**2178-1-30**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] had
hemoptysis during attempted left subclavian access in
Trendelenburg position. A post-procedure CXR revealed a LUL
opacity as well as a possible retrocardiac opacity. The patient
was empricially started on Levofloxacin for coverage of
community-acquired pneumonia. A CT of the chest was performed,
which revealed no AVM and findings consistent with likely
resolving LUL pneumonia. The pulmonary service was consulted for
further evaluation, and a bronchoscopy was performed on
[**2178-2-2**], with findings of heme in the apicoposterior LUL, and
BAL negative for organisms, fungus or AFB. Vasculitis labs were
als
