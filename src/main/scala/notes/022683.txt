[**6-20**] EKG: atrial fibrillation 91.  NA/QRS 110.  e/o LVH by
voltage criteria.  no ST or TW changes noted, poor baseline.  no
q waves.

[**6-20**] Echo: Biatrial enlargement. Normal left ventricular cavity
size with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy and mildly
depressed global left ventricular systolic function. Critical
aortic stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate
mitral regurgitation. At least moderate tricuspid regurgitation
in the setting of moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

[**6-20**]: CT chest: IMPRESSION:

1. Likely extravasation of IV contrast material into the sigmoid
colon from a colonic diverticulum, accounting for the patient's
bright red blood per rectum.

2. Concentric wall thickening within the distal descending colon
could relate to the stated history of a colonic mass.
Alternatively, this wall thickening could be the result of
normal peristalsis. Recommend correlation with the colonoscopy
report.

3. Slight wall thickening with intraluminal fluid involving the
rectum and distal sigmoid colon is most consistent with
proctocolitis.

4. Bibasilar septal thickening could be secondary to mild
pulmonary edema or mild fibrosis.

5. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

7. Small splenic hypodensities, too small to characterize.
Similarly,
multiple small bilateral renal lesions are too small to
characterize, although these lesions are likely simple cysts.

8. Marked atherosclerosis with moderate stenosis of the SMA
origin.

9. Enlarged right axillary lymph node, measuring 11 mm.

Part 1 is additionally labeled "left colon, 2 stitches = splenic
flexure, one stitch = rectosigmoid, one long stitch = inferior
mesenteric pedicle".  It consists of a segment of colon that
measures 52 cm in length and up to 5.5 cm in diameter.  A
portion of mesentery is attached to the colon that measures 46.5
x 5.5 x 3.6 cm.  The surgeon has designated two stitches as the
splenic flexure, one stitch as the rectosigmoid, and a long
stitch designating the inferior mesenteric pedicle.  The
mesentery is unremarkable.  The serosa of the bowel is smooth
and unremarkable.  A palpable mass is present within the bowel.
The serosa overlying the mass is inked black.  The specimen is
opened along the antimesenteric surface to reveal a fungating
ulcerated mass within the lumen that measures 4 x 3 cm.  This
mass is located 21 cm from the splenic flexure surgical margin,
32 cm from the rectosigmoid surgical margin, and 6.5 cm from the
cut mesenteric margin.  Serial slices show that the tumor does
appear to invade the muscularis propria and mesentery and is 1.5
cm deep.  No perforation is present.  There is a tan mucosal
polyp measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm, located 19 cm from the
rectosigmoid surgical margin.  Additionally, multiple
diverticula are present throughout the colon.  Two diverticula
with hypertrophical bowel wall adjacent to them are located 15
cm from the splenic flexure margin.  The remainder of the mucosa
is tan and unremarkable.  Within the mesentery, lymph nodes are
identified.  The specimen is represented as follows:  A = the
polyp which has be
