HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old
male with a history of Parkinson's disease contractures,
history of tracheostomies for inability to handle secretions,
history of urinary tract infection, aspiration pneumonia,
congestive heart failure and glaucoma presenting to the
MICU/SICU for evaluation for placement of [**Location (un) **] tube and
evaluation by interventional pulmonology.

The patient had a tracheostomy placed for greater than one
year.  Starting in the fall he had problems that
tracheostomy, specifically problems with suctioning.  The
patient apparently had difficulty in the initial placement of
the tracheostomy tube with a "actual long tube placed" and
the tube was apparently difficult to place.  The patient was
unable to be suctioned in [**Month (only) 359**] and was sent to the
Operating Room after admittance for tracheostomy tube change.
It was successful.  He went back to the nursing home and was
okay from that perspective until [**11-29**], when again he
could he could not be suctioned.  He was taken to the
Operating Room for revision.  Revision failed, however,
thoracic surgery reported a large area of necrotic tissue
with difficulty localizing the anterior wall of the trachea.
Because of that, endotracheal tube was placed on [**2155-12-4**] and the patient was placed on a T-piece at 40% FIO2.
The patient had fevers at that point at the outside hospital
and was treated for a pneumonia/bronchitis with Oxacillin and
Ceftazidime for 10 days.  He had a neck computerized
tomography scan which showed "a large amount of granulation
tissue."  Cardiothoracic Surgery and Otorhinolaryngology felt
they could not intervene.  Based on this, the patient was
referred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for
further evaluation by Pulmonary Surgery.  By report from the
outside hospital the patient had no positive micro-data and
was on no precautions.
