History of Present Illness:
Patient is 55 yo male with h/o Crohn's disease and
hypercoagulable condition s/p multiple amputations as a
complication of this who presents for increasing low back pain
and failure to care for himself at home. Pt was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] for [**Hospital1 **] and found to have line sepsis and new
dx of stage IV mucinous adenocarcinoma from fungating mass
originating from enterocutaneous fistula. (Admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] from
[**9-10**]) His tunnel line was replaced at [**Hospital1 2177**]
on the contralateral side after removing the previous line. The
patient also had multiple episodes of anemia characterized by a
HCT drop from 24-25. Abdominal CT scan negative for bleeding. He
required 4 units PRBCs but a source of the bleeding was never
