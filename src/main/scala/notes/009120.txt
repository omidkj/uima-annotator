Admission Date:  [**2190-4-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2190-5-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2128-5-7**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]

This is a discharge summary up until [**2190-5-2**].

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
female with a long history of interstitial lung disease on
chronic prednisone, COPD, and bronchiectasis on home CPAP and
02 who presents with increasing somnolence and possible
increased sputum production.  The patient gives an unclear
history as to the reason she called 9-1-1 but notes that over
the past two to three days she has not been feeling well and
has been somewhat sleepier than usual.  She was seen
approximately two days prior in the clinic for complaints of
dysphagia which felt like swallowing razor blades, at which
time her proton pump inhibitor was increased.  She notes
modest sputum production and cough but more importantly
increased lethargy.

In the ED, there was concern for C02 narcosis given her
long-standing lung disease.  An ABG was performed showing C02
of 58 which is within her baseline.  Her 02 saturations were
89% on room air.  She was also given Narcan with minimal
improvement.  She was given one dose of prednisone 60 and
sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further evaluation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]:  Vital signs:
Temperature 100.1, blood pressure 98/49, heart rate 101,
respirations 23, saturating 96% on 1.5 liters 02 nasal
cannula.  General appearance:  The patient was somnolent but
arousable, intermittently falls asleep during the
examination.  Head and neck examination:  No JVD noted.  Neck
supple.  The oropharynx was slightly dry.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Diffuse inspiratory rales
and squeaks.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, obese.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologic:
The patient was with notable asterixis on examination.
Otherwise, nonfocal.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, the white count
was 13.2, hematocrit 30.2, platelets 457,000.  The initial
INR was 3.6.  Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 135, K 4.4,
chloride 96, bicarbonate 31, BUN and creatinine 21 and 1.8,
glucose 53.  ABGs 7.36/55/69/32.

Chest x-ray showed interstitial opacities consistent with
interstitial lung disease with no focal consolidation or CHF.

EKG was without acute ST changes.

Previous echocardiogram in [**12-24**] showed an EF of 40-45%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  SOMNOLENCE/ASTERIXIS:  After
withholding the patient's medications overnight, she was
increasingly alert in the morning.  She had no evidence of
uremia, liver failure, or other etiology of her asterixis and
as her asterixis significantly improved the following day it
was felt that her mental status was likely related to
excessive use of sedating medications.  This was felt to be
the reason for her admission.  It was not thought that she
had any increased C02 retention.  Her medications were slowly
restarted but her MS Contin was held.  She was urged to keep
careful track of her medications as she is on numerous
psychiatric and pain medications which may be sedating.

2.  RESISTANT PSEUDOMONAS COLONIZATION:  The patient was not
felt to have a new pneumonia and chest x-ray was similar to
her baseline; however, she is thought to have resistant
Pseudomonas colonization related to her bronchiectasis.  For
treatment of this, she was begun on a regimen of inhaled
Tobramycin for 28 days which will alternate with an inhaled
dose of [**Doctor Last Name **] for 28 days indefinitely.  This will be
followed-up by her pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**], as an
outpatient.

3.  CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE:  She will continue on home CPAP,
home 02, home nebulizers including Albuterol, Ipratropium,
and Mucomyst as well as outpatient chest PT.  Her initial
prednisone dose will be tapered.

4.  ARTHRITIS/PAIN CONTROL:  Her oxycodone was restarted as
well as her Cox2 inhibitor, Tylenol, calcium.  Her MS Contin
was held because of concern for somnolence.

5.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  She had no evidence of heart
failure during her admission.  She was restarted on her ACE
inhibitor after her creatinine improved and was restarted on
her home Lasix dose.

6.  ELEVATED INR:  The patient is status post hip fracture
five weeks ago and was ambulating with a walker.  Her INR was
as high as 4.7.  She is currently five weeks into a six week
course of Coumadin therapy for DVT prophylaxis with a goal
INR of 1.5 to 2.  Her Coumadin dose was held during her
hospital course.  She will follow-up with an INR check as an
outpatient.  She may not need to receive additional Coumadin
doses as her INR is elevated during the fifth week of her
anticoagulation course.  She is currently ambulating with a
walker.

7.  RENAL:  Her creatinine was initially elevated, thought to
be related to hypovolemia and decreased p.o. intake.  After
IV fluid hydration, her creatinine improved to baseline.

8.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  Her Glyburide was initially held as
she was not tolerating p.o.  She was placed on an insulin
sliding scale.  Her Glyburide may be restarted at the time of
discharge.

9.  PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS:  Her psychiatric medications
that were thought to be sedating such as tricyclics were held
initially.  They may be restarted one by one as tolerated.

10.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had a history of
dysphagia two days prior to admission.  This was thought to
be unrelated to her current admission.  Her PPI was
continued.  She was given Nystatin swish and swallow for
possible thrush as a cause of her dysphagia, although no
thrush was noted on examination.  She was urged to have
outpatient follow-up for possible EGD if these symptoms
continue.  Her hematocrit remained stable during her stay.
She was told that she may need outpatient colonoscopy which
had been discussed during her previous outpatient visits.

DISPOSITION:  Physical Therapy was consulted and the patient
was felt to be safe for discharge to home with PT as she
previously completed a course of rehabilitation after hip
surgery.  She was transferred to the medical floor on
[**2190-5-2**].  A discharge summary addendum will follow this
