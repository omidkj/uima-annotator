History of Present Illness:
57 M c CAD s/p CABG, PCI, PVD s/p atherectomy to R SFA, dm2,
bilateral RAS, copd p/w sudden onset SOB to OSH. The patient
developed acute respiratory distress rather suddenly while on a
car trip with his family. EMS was called and found pt in car in
resp distress. He was taken to [**Hospital1 10478**] where he arrived 1620

CXR showed CHF. He was given morphine, labetalol IV 20, nebs,
solumedrol 125 IV, ceftriaxone 1 gm, d-dimer was 1800(nl is
400). He received 200 lasix IC as well and put out well. There
were non-specific small ST elevations II, III, aVF that resolved
with improved bp control. tnI was 0.06 9nl 0.03, CK 315. BNP was
1870. ABG was 7.10/73/88.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO Study Date of [**2131-7-3**]
Ejection Fraction: 35% to 40% (nl >=55%)
Conclusions:  The study is suboptimal due to inability to
properly position the patient.
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed, with
global hypokinesis (probably slightly worse in the inferolateral
wall). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderatel global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-5-19**], the
overall left ventricular systolic function has deteriorated
slightly.



Brief Hospital Course:
57 M c CAD s/p CABG, PCI, PVD s/p atherectomy to R SFA, DM2,
Renal Artery Stenosis, COPD p/w sudden-onset SOB to OSH.
Underwent angiography & stenting of Right Renal Artery & celiac
artery [**2131-7-4**].  SBP improving since stenting.
.
## Resp failure:
Pt intubated upon admission for hypoxic respiratory failure.
His acute respiratory decompensation was due to CHF exacerbation
in the setting of hypertensive urgency with renal artery
stenosis.  PE was considered as a possible cause of the acute
respiratory decompensation given the history; however, the pt's
rapid improvement with diuresis argued against this.  Lower
extremity non-invasives were performed here & were negative for
DVT.  Pt was sucessfuly extubated on [**7-3**].
COPD & bronchitis may have contributed to pt's respiratory
failure as well.  There was no evidence of PNA on CXR, though pt
initially febrile with leukocytosis.  Pt reported having a cough
for one week prior to this event (his whole family has similiar
sx's).  We treated him for a presumed bronchitis with 5 days of
azithromycin.  The pt was weaned off O2 and tolerated room air.
.
## Cardiac:
#Ischemia: significant CAD history. Pt did not have ACS, despite
subtle ST elevations. Enzymes CK: 312-->255  MB: 11-->14  MB:
3.5-->5.4 Trop-*T*: 0.05-->0.04.  He was treated with aspirin,
[**Month/Year (2) **], Statin and beta-blocker.  Discussed with pt the
importance of smoking cessation.
.
#Pump: EF 35-40%, w/ slight decrease in LV systolic funx since
last echo, BNP 1870, CXR showed CHF.  Oxygenation improved with
diuresis.  Prior to renal artery stenting, pt required Nitro gtt
and multiple anti-hypertensive to try to control his SBP.
Following RRA stenting, pt was weaned off Nitro drip & BP
normalized, though still on multiple anti-hypertensive
medications.  The day prior to discharge the pt's SBP ranged
from 110's to 130's on the following regimen: Toprol XL 200mg
daily, HCTZ 25mg daily, amlodipine 10mg daily, Imdur 120mg
daily, and hydralazine 25mg QID.  His regimen was re-adjusted on
the morning of discharge: the hydralazine was discontinued and
lasix 20mg daily (his previous dose) was started.  Of note, the
Imdur dose was maximized given the pt's history of apparent
stable angina.  He was given two diuretics because of his
apparent tendency to become volume overloaded.  Initiation of an
ACEi was considered, particularly given the pt's h/o CHF &
diabetes; however, given the number of changes made to the pt's
anti-hypertensive regimen prior to discharge we refrained from
this.  Once the pt has been stabilized on his new regimen as an
outpt, he will likely benefit from an ACEi.

## Vascular Dz:
The pt had been previously found to have renal artery stenosis
(although prior to admission it was thought to be bilateral).
He also described a history of weight loss and poor appetite,
which was consistent with mesenteric ischemia.  Upon angiography
of the aorta, the viscera, and the renal arteries, the pt was
found to have only uni-lateral RAS (90%) & celiac artery
stenosis (70%).  These lesions were stented with good residuals
& flow post-stent placement.  He had an uncomplicated recovery
from the procedure.
.
## ARF: Pt was in renal failure on admission with Cr=1.7.
Post-diuresis, the pt's Cr trended down to 1.1 (his baseline).
Hence, it was thought that his acute renal failure was
pre-renal, resulting from poor forward flow & poor perfusion in
the setting of CHF exacerbation.
.
## Fever/leukocytosi: Pt had likely had bronchitis. No clear
infiltrate on CXR. He was given ceftriaxone x1 was given at OSH.
 Lung sounds course & (+) non-productive cough. WBC on admission
in the 20's; however, it was thought that the pt was likely
intra-vascularly dry & hemoconcentrated (Hct was 49, as well).
WBC trended down to 11.  He completed a course of azithromycin.
Was not febrile except at time of admission.  Cough was
improving during hospitalization.
.
## COPD: no PFTs available.  No steroids were given, as it was
thought that his copd was playing a major role in his picture.
He recieved albuterol & tiatropium in
