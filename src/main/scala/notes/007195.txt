History of Present Illness:
Asked by the Neurology service to see this gentleman for
evaluation and possible angiogram.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a right handed 63 yo M with hx parathyroid
adenoma that was here transferred from OSH with a R occipital
hemorrhage on [**3-26**].

He presented a history of  developing a headache while sitting
on
the couch at 10:45 AM he developed a severe right temporal
headache then moving toward his occiput.  Pain waxed and waned
and was able to ambulate during this.  He looked
at a picture on his wall and noticed the left side was missing
and went to [**Hospital3 **].

Upon arrival to OSH he was found to be in atrial flutter with BP
161/128.  CT head showed a large right occipital IPH and was
given fosphenytoin, Ativan, started on a dilt drip and
transferred here.


Past Medical History:
-parathyroid adenoma
-prior trauma to R eye

-lives with wife, no tobacco, occasional wine

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2139-3-26**] 5:28 PM
1. Essentially unchanged large right occipital lobe
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, with mild mass effect in the adjacent parenchyma but
no gross
midline shift. Differential diagnosis consideration for acute
intraparenchymal hemorrhage includes hypertension, underlying
brain lesion, AVM, or amyloid angiopathy.
2. No intraventricular hemorrhagic extension. No new foci of
hemorrhage. No developing hydrocephalus.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2139-3-28**]
1. Right occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild
surrounding edema.
2. Findings on CT angiography of the head suggest a most likely
an
arteriovenous malformation in the region of hemorrhage within
tortuous
arterial structures supplying the region with a 5-mm density
could represent compressed nidus or venous aneurysm. Draining
vein is also visualized. No other vascular abnormalities.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2139-4-2**]
1. Unchanged size of the right occipital intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, and
surrounding edema, and minimal mass effect on the adjacent
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.

2. Extensive paranasal mucosal thickening and opacification of
mastoid air
cells bilaterally could represent an ongoing inflammatory
process.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2139-4-5**]:
No significant interval change.  Similar size of right occipital
intraparenchymal hemorrhage and surrounding edema with a similar
mass effect on occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle.


Brief Hospital Course:
63M initially presented to OSH with R temporal/occipital
headache. At OSH, CTH showed 5 x 2.5cm right occipital bleed. He
also was noted to go into aflutter with RVR and was started on
diltiazem gtt. Upon txfer to [**Hospital1 18**], he was noted to have a left
facial droop with good motor strength throughout. Repeat head CT
showed that the hemorrhage had grown to 4 x 2.3cm with edema but
no midline shift. He was admitted to stroke Neurology/
Neuro-ICU. On [**3-27**] he had Aflutter with RVR and he received a
Amio [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Aline was placed, and he received Metoprolol 5mg
IV x 2. Metoprolol PO was started. A TTE showed an EF >75% and
impaired relaxation. On [**3-28**] he was tachycardiac, cardiac
enzymes were sent but negative. Digoxin was started and
Metoprolol was increased. A CTA was performed which showed an
underlying AVM. On [**3-29**] he continued to have Aflutter with RVR
and Cardiology was consulted. The patient was given Lasix,
Ibutilide, Verapamil, Lopressor, and Digoxin. He was made NPO at
midnight for possible TEE and cardioversion. On [**3-30**] he
underwent a TEE which showed no clot and then underwent
cardioversion into normal sinus rhythm.

He remained stable and on [**4-1**] he underwent a Angiogram for
embolization of the AVM. Post-embolization, he was transferred
to Neurosurgery and remained in the Neuro-ICU for observation.
Post-embolization, his SBP was kept below 110, this was acheived
with Labetolol IV PRN, no drip was required. On [**4-2**] he remained
stable and visual fields appeared improved, his SBP was
liberalized to 160. He was written for SDU transfer but no beds
were available and he was kept in the ICU. On [**4-3**], he was
transferred to the floor on telemetry. Early [**4-4**] morning patient
was noted to have aflutter with RVR and cardiology was
consulted. He received Lopressor and a Heparin drip was started
for the PTT goal of 60-90. Once therapeutic, a head CT was done
which was stable. He remained stable [**Date range (1) 90093**] with the plan for
Cardioversion/ablation on [**4-6**].  He underwent this procedure and
was cleared without issue.  he was maintained on heparin drip
overnight and was cleared for d/c home by cardiology with daily
coumadin dosing and follow up with his pcp.

He will see us in the office in 4 weeks with CT.

He agrees with this plan
