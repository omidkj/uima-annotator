Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F [**Hospital3 **] resident with Afib, SSS s/p PM, h/o cervical
CA s/p [**Hospital 16859**] transferred from rehab today for fever, lethargy and
hypoxia. Pt had recent [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission from [**Date range (1) 109440**] for LLL
PNA after she presented with hypoxia, fevers, and hypotension.
During that stay, pt received dopamine gtt through peripheral IV
(pt's family refused central line after numerous failed attempts
in ED)and was treated for LLL PNA with ceftriaxone +azithro
+flagyl for empiric coverage for PNA and C diff (h/o recent C
diff). Other events during her recent hospital course included
worsening renal insufficiency thought to be secondary to ATN,
and CHF with episode of flash pulmonary edema in ICU requiring
diuretics. She was weaned off pressors, had good UOP, and was
satting 95% RA per last d/c summary and was discharged with PICC
line for completion of Abx. On that admission, pt's code status
was also changed from full code to DNR/DNI after discussion with
pt's family (confirmed with living will [**2096**]).

Today, at rehab, pt was reported to have increased lethargy,
fevers to 102.7, hypoxic. Currently, alert and oriented,
mentating well with no c/o sob, no chest pain or abd pain, no
dysuria, no fevers/chills. In ED, BP initially 100/50 but
subsequent values as low as 80/20, unresponsive to 2L IVF. Given
ceftazidime and vancomycin and started on dopamine gtt and
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F [**Hospital3 **] resident with Afib, SSS s/p PM, h/o cervical
CA s/p [**Hospital 16859**] transferred from rehab on [**2103-6-12**] for fevers,
lethargy and hypoxia. Pt had recent [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission from
[**Date range (1) 109440**] for LLL PNA after she presented with hypoxia,
fevers, and hypotension. During that stay, pt received dopamine
drip through peripheral IV (pt's family refused central line
after numerous failed attempts in ED)and was treated for LLL PNA
with ceftriaxone +azithro +flagyl for empiric coverage for PNA
and C diff (h/o recent C diff). Other events during her recent
hospital course included worsening renal insufficiency thought
to be secondary to ATN, and CHF with episode of flash pulmonary
edema in ICU requiring diuretics. She was weaned off pressors,
had good UOP, and was satting 95% RA per last d/c summary and
was discharged with PICC line for completion of Abx. On that
admission, pt's code status was also changed from full code to
DNR/DNI after discussion with pt's family (confirmed with living
will [**2096**]).

On [**2103-6-12**] (day of admission), at rehab, pt was reported to have
increased lethargy, fevers to 102.7, hypoxic. But was alert and
oriented, mentating well with no c/o sob, no chest pain or abd
pain, no dysuria, no fevers/chills in the ED. In ED, BP
initially 100/50 but subsequent values as low as 80/20,
unresponsive to 2 L IVF. Given ceftazidime and vancomycin and
started on dopamine drip and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

1. G+ sepsis - admitted with hypotension:
 Given fevers at rehab and hypotension, thought to be likely an
infectious source although lactate not elevated and wbc was
normal. Initially fevers thought to be due to inadequently
treated LLL PNA and now with worsening left effusion. U/A was
negative for UTI. Patient was still having diarrhea with h/o C.
diff and [**6-8**] stool sample positive for C diff. On admission the
patient was showing good signs of perfusion with good UOP and
improved mental status from previous admission.
  Blood cultures from admission ([**6-12**]) came back positive for G+
cocci.  Likely MRSA based on patients history.  Awaiting
sensitivites.  Source likely Right PICC.  The right PICC line
was removed and the tip was sent for culture.  The results were
still pending upon discharge.
  The patient was weaned off of the DA drip within 12 hours of
arriving in the ICU.  Her pressures have remained in the 80's to
90's.  Patients UOP and mentation were good and it seems to be
patients baseline BP.  We were cautious with using IV fluids to
bolus low pressures due to the patients CHF.
  The patient was treated with Ceftazidime and vancomycin for
empiric coverage; Yesterday preliminary cultures ([**1-17**]) came back
as gram + cocci in clusters and chains.  Will await final
culture results and sensitivities.
- if still febrile and hypoxic, will need to consider tap of
effusion r/o parapneumonic effusion
- random cortisol 23.7; no adrenal insufficency
- F/u sputum, blood, urine cxs
- EKG unchanged
2. PNA: LLL pneumonia still evident on CXR from previous
admission, but unlikely the cause of fevers and hypotension on
this admission.  Patient started on Ceftaz on previous admission
to treat the pneumonia.  Now on day #7 of that treatment
(started on [**6-7**]).  Will finish a 14 day course.
3. CHF: pt w/2+ pitting edema, CXR c/w pulm edema, but satting
well on 2L O2.  We were vary cautious with IVF hydration to
avoid fluid overload, especially as patient is DNI. Had echo on
last admission with likely diastolic dysfunction with EF >55%.
A CXR on [**6-13**] showed increased prominence of upper lung zone
pulm. Vasculature consistent with mild CHF
4. C diff positive: Had recent C diff in [**Month (only) 116**] and now [**6-8**] sample
positive for C diff, also still with diarrhea. Will treat this
1st recurrance with PO Flagyl for now as this is first treatment
failure.  If patient has 2nd recurrence should consider treating
with PO vancomycin. A stool culture is pending from [**6-13**].
5. Anemia: Because of cardiac issues, should have low threshold
for transfusing at Hct <28. On [**6-14**] patient had hct of 26.9 and
was transfused 1 unit of PRBC. Hct rose to 31.9.
5. CAD: h/o NSTEMI in [**3-20**], which was likely demand during
sepsis. Continue with ASA. Previous beta blockers on hold from
previous admission given hypotension.
6. Afib: stable & rate-controlled currently; only on ASA due to
falls risk.
7. Renal insufficiency - h/o ATN on previous admission,
creatatine now at baseline, patient has good UOP but could still
post-ATN diuresis. Continue to monitor creatine given
hypotension on admission.
8. Access: R PICC removed and tip sent for culture, PIV.  Will
need to wait a few days before a new line can be placed.
11. Code: DNR/DNI re-discussed with pt who still agrees but
would like pressors
