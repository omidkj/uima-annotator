Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Lipomatous
hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Normal LV wall thickness. Normal regional LV systolic function.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Trivial MR. The MR vena contracta is <0.3cm.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, with partial
calcifcation of the posterior leaflet. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass: Patient is A paced on phenylepherine infusion.
Preserved biventricuar function LVEF >55%. Mitral regurgitation
remains mild. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All findings discussed with srugeons at the time of
the exam.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
