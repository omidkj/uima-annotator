History of Present Illness:
72 year-old Portuguese-speaking female with history of chronic
thoracic aneurysm s/p stent graft [**12-14**] for type B dissection
with penetrating ulcer, hypertension who presented to [**Hospital **]
with back pain similar to initial presentation with TAA. SBP at
OSH in 200s and CTA showed small dissection, resulting in
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2179-2-22**]. Here, CTA showed: No new
abnormalities, focal dissection 2 cm from the superior portion
of the thoracic stent unchanged from [**2178-12-21**].
.
The patient was initially admitted to CT surgery but once the
graft was acknowledged to be stable she was transferred to the
MICU for blood pressure management. BP controlled with labetalol
and nipride gtt. NGT was placed for nausea/vomiting soon after
admission showing dark maroon drainage. 2U transfused around
midnight the night of admission following difficult T&C. GI
consulted for GIB and performed EGD which showed gastritis.
Patient was placed on PPI and serial hematocrits were monitored;
hematocrit stable at 28 prior to transfer. The patient's blood
pressure regimen was transitioned to oral regimen of
hydralazine, isosorbide, and nifedipine.
.
On review of systems, the patient complains of recent chills.
She denies any chest pain, back pain, shortness of breath,
fevers, weight loss, fatigue, headaches, dizziness, blurred
vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria,
increased urgency, diarrhea, hematochezia, melena. All other
systems reviewed in detail and negative except for what has been
mentioned above.

CTA THORAX W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2179-2-22**]
There is an endovascular stent graft within the descending
thoracic aorta. There is no endoleak identified. Superior to the
aortic stent graft, at the level of the carina (series 3, image
17), there is a small plaque ulceration unchanged from the prior
study of [**2179-1-20**]. It measures approximately 4 x 11 mm.
This finding is confirmed on the sagittal images as well. The
small previously seen superior type 1 endoleak is stable
compared to [**2178-12-21**]. As mentioned on the prior report,
this could represent a focal dissection or ulceration at the
superior end of the stent. However this is unchanged from
[**2178-12-21**].
IMPRESSION:
1. No new abnormalities. Focal dissection 2cm from the superior
portion of the thoracic stent is unchanged from [**2178-12-21**].
.
ECG Study Date of [**2179-2-22**]  1:49:26 PM
Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V block. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with
secondary ST-T wave changes. Anterolateral ST-T wave
abnormalities most likely related to left ventricular
hypertrophy, but cannot rule out myocardial ischemia. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2178-12-18**] anterolateral ST-T wave
abnormalities and voltage criteria for left ventricular
hypertrophy are new. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 year-old with chronic thoracic aortic aneurysm status post
stent transferred from OSH with back pain, resolved soon after
admission, but ongoing hypertension, upper GI bleed secondary to
gastritis s/p two units PRBC, and acute renal failure likely
contrast-induced. CTA showed stable graft.
.
1. Thoracic aorta aneurysm: Here, her CTA showed stable
appearance of her stent graft. CT surgery initially managed the
patient; however, once her graft was assessed to be stable, she
was transferred to the MICU for blood pressure control. The
patient's blood pressure was initially controlled with labetalol
and nipride gtt in MICU with goal SBP 120-140. The patient was
then transitioned to oral medications for blood pressure
control. The patient's aneurysm is believed secondary to
atherosclerotic disease; extensive rheumatologic and infectious
work-up on previous admission was negative. The patient's blood
pressure was controlled with isosorbile, nifedipine, and
metoprolol prior to discharge. The patient was scheduled for
repeat CTA torso scheduled in [**4-14**] with cardiac surgery
follow-up
.
2. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7. The patient's
creatinine peaked at 1.6 and trended down to 1.5 prior to
discharge. The acute renal failure was likely secondary to
contrast administration. FeNa 0.20 consistent with pre-renal
etiology, although the patient was not oliguric. The patient did
not respond to fluid challenge and was 6 liters positive for
length of stay. Urine eosinophils negative. Kidneys appeared
normal on CT abdomen. The patient's medications were renally
dosed. The patient will follow-up with her primary care doctor
for resolution.
.
3. Nausea/vomiting/gastritis: NGT on admission following
episodes of nausea/vomiting revealed dark maroon drainage.
Etiology of nausea unclear but resolved soon after. The patient
has history of gastritis likely secondary to rheumatoid
arthritis. The patient denies any prior BRBPR, melena or prior
hematemesis/coffee ground emesis. She received 2 units PRBC on
admission for drop in hematocrit. GI consulted; EGD revealed
gastritis in body and fundus of the stomach. This duplicates EGD
from [**Hospital3 **] from [**2178-4-8**] which also showed gastritis.
The patient should schedule a follow-up endoscopy in one month.
