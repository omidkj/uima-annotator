Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83-year-old Rusian-speaking gentleman with multiple
problems including CAD s/p CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy with
systolic and diastolic heart failure (EF 40%), CKD stage V on
HD, [**First Name3 (LF) **] sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker, s/p CVA with residual
left facial droop and RLE weakness, DMII, recent admission to
[**Hospital1 112**] for LLE transmetatarsal amputation who presents with acute
dyspnea. Started mid-morning, VNA noted patient was dyspnic,
called EMS, enroute became acutely worse. Noted to be hypoxic to
mid-80's in triage. Similar episode of dyspnea during recent
hospitalization that resolved after HD.
.
Patient reports not feeling well on morning of admission. He
says his blood pressures were low in the 80s/40s and his sugars
were low at 85. He had [**Location (un) 2452**] juice, pickles and some other food
and then had an episode of nausea and vomiting.  He called his
VNA who evaluated him and felt that he sounded crackly on exam
and sent to the ED. He reports some chest pressure and shortness
of breath.  He denies cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary
symptoms (patient makes little urine at baseline).
.
In the ED, initial VS were 38 84% and was in respiratory
distress. Exam was significant for RLL crackles. Labs were
significant for WBC count of 23.7 with 93% neutrophils (no
bands), K of 6.1, lactate of 2.6.  ECG showed paced rhythm
without peaked T waves.  CXR showed findings consistent with
volume overload. Patient was given levofloxacin and cefepime for
possible pneumonia.  He was then admitted to the MICU for
further care given hypoxia and need for dialysis.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient felt continued shortness of
breath and chest pressure.  He was given antibiotics and
dialyzed and breathing improved.

CXR [**2168-5-23**]:
Evaluation of the patient with CAD, end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis with dyspnea.

Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
to [**2168-5-23**] obtained at 1:32 p.m.

Since the prior study no substantial change has been
demonstrated in the
cardiomediastinal silhouette, position of pacemaker leads and
hemodialysis catheter as well as small bilateral pleural
effusion.  Right upper lobe opacity is slightly more conspicuous
on the current study but that might be due to interval
improvement in the right lower lobe opacity as overall
improvement of the aeration of the right lung is noted.  There
is no pneumothorax.
.
ECHO [**2168-5-24**]:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. LV
systolic function appears depressed with lateral hypokinesis and
probable anterior hypokinesis but views are suboptimal for
assessment of regional wall motion (estimated ejection fraction
?35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The aortic valve is
not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is at least mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-11-27**],
findings are probably similar although studies are technically
suboptimal for comparison. The tricuspid regurgitant peak
gradient is slightly lower than in the previous study but may be
underestimated.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 83-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems
including CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, s/p CVA, CKD stage V on
HD, [**Year (4 digits) **] sinus s/p pacemaker, DM II, and recent left TMA
amputation who presents with acute dyspnea found to be volume
overloaded on exam and with leukocytosis.
