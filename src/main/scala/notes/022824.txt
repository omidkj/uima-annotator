Chief Complaint:
Left Lung Collapse

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with aspiration of secretions
Bedside left sided Chest tube Placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 30833**] is a 76 M recently admitted for gallstone
pancreatitis. He presented on [**2108-7-13**] with fevers and
tachycardia and was sent to IR for percutaneous drainage of
abdominal collection, and placement of a drainage catheter on
[**2108-7-24**].  Due to concern for intra-abdominal hypertension, the
patient was taken urgently for exploratory laparotomy,
Pancreatic debridement involving resection of pancreatic neck,
body, and tail, with placement of large drains, and a
Cholecystectomy. Post operatively, he required intensive
supportive care in the ICU.  Due to the continued need for
ventilatory support, he had a percutaneously placed
tracheostomy. Since his previous admission, he was doing well,
his drains were discontinued, and his trach was decannulated. On
[**2108-10-4**] he began to experience some dyspnea at rest. Denies
palpitations, fevers, chills, change in cough. He was found to
have left lung collapse. Several non-invasive measures to
inflate left lung were attempted and failed.  He was then
admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for bronchoscopy.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Hepatopancreaticobiliary
Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment of his left lung
collapse in the setting of his recent necrotizing pancreatitis.
On [**2108-10-6**] the patient underwent a therapeutic bronchoscopy,
with aspiration of secretions. The procedure revealed thick
mucus plugging and (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). Mr. [**Known lastname 30833**] was extubated in the OR, but upon arrival to
the PACU, the patient became unresponsive and apneic. Intubation
was attempted twice, resulting in minor laryngeal injury
requiring the administration of Dexamethasone. After a second
attempted intubation, the third was successful. To evaluate the
cause of his respiratory failure, a left chest ultrasound was
performed. This ultrasound revealed a large left sided pleural
effusion. The chest was prepped and draped and the patient
received a chest tube placement at bedside. After he was
stabilized, he was transferred to the surgical ICU, on pressors
still intubated.

Neuro: The patient was admitted to the ICU intubated and
sedated, he was started on a propofol drip for sedation. He was
weaned to minimal sedation by POD 1 and was interactive and
responsive. POD 3 the patient was extubated and no longer
required sedation. He was given acetaminophen and oxycodone prn
for pain control to good effect.

CV: While in PACU the patient became hypotensive requiring
multiple boluses of fluid and a NEO gtt, he remained on that
drip when transferred to the unit. He was succesfully weaned off
of Neo by POD 1.

Pulmonary: The patient required reintubation in the PACU he was
started on CMV, but was weaned to CPAP by POD 1. His chest tube
put out greater than 2 L of pleural fluid immediately, it was
left to waterseal. The pleural fluid was positive for PMNs, and
amylase, but no organisms. The patient had normal serum amylase
so his elevated pleural fluid level was considered reactive. The
patient was extubated successfully on [**10-9**]. His sats were
maintained on nasal cannula and he was given atrovent and
albuterol nebulization treatments PRN.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. An ostomy applicance was placed to his midline fistula
from his emergent exlap. A post pyloric dobhoff was placed POD 3
for nutrition supplementation. He was started on a thickened
liquids/pureed solids diet POD 4 per recommendations of Speech
and swallow.  He had a foley immediately post op for urine
output monitoring which remained in place.  Patient's intake and
output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when
necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted
when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection, of which there were
none.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly on a regular
insulin sliding scale.

Hematology: The patient has a known history of chronic anemia.
Patient's complete blood count was examined as required. No
transfusions were needed.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a thickened
diet, at his baseline ambulatory status, still had a foley in
place, and pain was well controlled.  The patient and his proxy
received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with
understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
