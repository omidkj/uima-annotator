Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levaquin / Gabapentin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with placement of a drug eluting stent
to the Left Anterior Descending Artery and placement of a drug
eluting stent to the Left Circumflex Artery.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year-old female with a medical history significant
for coronary artery disease (catheterization [**2203-10-19**] w/ known
occluded RCA, 90% mid LAD intervened on w/ BMS, minimal LCX) s/p
anterior MI in [**2198**] (DES to LAD and distal LCX), paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, heart failure with a preserved
ejection fraction (55% [**2201**]), and end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis presents from home with substernal chest pain.
Since her recent hospitalization in [**Month (only) **] she has
experienced brief non-exertional intermittent (once per week)
substernal chest pain. She describes this as sharp, radiates to
the back, associatd with nausea and relieved with SLNG. However,
for the past week, this has been happening daily. It typically
starts at 8PM at night and continues until 6AM the next morning
and has been associated with nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis.
She has missed medication, including aspirin and plavix, during
this time. This morning her chest discomfort was more severe,
prompting her to go to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**].
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**]-Cardiology service
at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2203-10-18**] after presenting with chest pain, with
positive nuclear [**Year (4 digits) **] testing showing a defect in the
inferolateral wall and ST-depressions in the lateral leads seen
on serial EKGs. Cardiac catheterization ([**2203-10-19**]) known occluded
RCA, minimal left circumflex disease, and 90% napkin ring
stenosis in the mid-LAD just distal to her previous stent and an
Integrity BMS was placed. The first diagonal branch had an
ostial pinch lesion on the order of 70% after stenting with
TIMI-3 flow. She had chest pain following her procedure with
some ST-changes that resolved with Nitro gtt. She was discharged
home on [**2203-10-20**] on aspirin,plavix, coumadin.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], initial vitals: 98.2 HR: 80 BP: 99/49 Resp: 24
O(2)Sat: 94, exam unremarkable. EKG reportedly showed V4-5 ST
depession and on repeat with worsening pain showed ST depression
AVF, I, V4-6. She was given SLNG with improvement in pain. She
was started on nitro gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the BIMDC ED, initial VS 97.4 114/80 108 20 94% 4L NC. An EKG
showed sinus rhythm, rate of 109, normal axis, ST depressions
V3-6, I, II, III, AVF with 1.5mm ST elevation in AVR. Initial
labs notable for troponin of 0.08, INR of 2.5.  She was
transported to the cardiac catheterization lab urgently. In the
cath lab she was found to have >90% ostial LAD and LCX disease.
She got [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 1 to LAD and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 1 to LCX with good return of
flow after. She got plavix 600mg. She did not get heparin,
integrillin. She did not get FFP.  She got 250cc IVF and 80cc
contrast in cath lab.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient reports some left shoulder
pain but denies chest pain, shortness of breath.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep
venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. They deny bleeding at
the time of prior procedures or surgeries. Denies headaches or
vision changes. No cough or upper respiratory symptoms. Denies
chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations.
Denies shortness of breath. No nausea or vomiting, denies
abdominal pain. No dysuria or hematuria. No change in bowel
movements or bloody stools. Denies muscle weakness, myalgias or
neurologic complaints. No exertional buttock or calf pain.

Cardiac Catheterization ([**2204-1-12**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this known right dominant
system
demonstrated severe 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The right

coronary artery was not injected but was known to have diffuse
sub-total
occlusion on prior angiography.  The LMCA was a large vessel
free of
angiographically significant coronary artery disease.  The LAD
had an
80% ostial lesion, but was otherwise withouht angiographically
significant coronary artery disease and with widely patent
stents.  The
LCX had an 80% ostial lesion but was otherwise without
angiographically
significant coronary artery disease with widely patent stents.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial blood
pressure with a central aortic blood pressure of 103/52.
3. Successful PCI to 80% ostial stenoses in both LAD and LCX
arteries
with deployment of a 3.0 x 15 mm Promus DES to LAD, and a 3.0 x
18 mm
Promus DES to LCX, by simultaneous kissing stents technique,
reducing
both ostial lesions to 0% residual stenoses.
4. Successful deployment of 8 Fr An
