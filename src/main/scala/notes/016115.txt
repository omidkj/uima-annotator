History of Present Illness:
86 yo female with hx of CAD s/p CABG, DMII, HTN, and tachy/brady
syndrome who presents with bradycardia and diziness. Pt was
recently admitted [**Date range (1) 23590**] for episode of diziness. During that
hospitalization she was started on meclizine for vertigo and
evaluated by EP for tachy/brady syndrome and started on
amiodarone and decreased dose of atenolol. Per notes she was not
feeling well at home with increasing diziness and slow heart
rate. She was seen by her PCP today and found to have sinus
bradycardia in the 40-50 range with nl SBP. She had associated
diziness and diaphoresis, but no chest pain, chest tightness or
palpitations. Her daughter attempted to send her to the [**Name (NI) **] but
she refused. Her PCP decreased her atenolol dose to 50mg with
plan for follow-up with cardiology.
.
In the ED her HR was unclear heart block vs sinus bradycardia
with a faster junctional escape at 30bpm and SBP in the 80's.
She was given 0.5mg atropine started on peripheral dopamine with
only mild improvement in her BP and HR. Attempt was made to
place a central line and the pt exhibited signs of choking with
hypoxia so decision was made for intubation and she was given
succinocholine and etomodate for rapid sequence intubation and
given a dose of 20mg IV lasix due to signs of CHF on repeat CXR.
Due to poor response to atropine, a temporary pacing wire was
placed through a right IJ cordis, but the patient began to mount
an intrinsic escape HR of >60 at that point. Due to continued
difficulty with sedation throughout the procedure she recieved
versed 5mg x2, 2mgx1, fentanyl 100mcgx1 and another undocumented
dose of Versed. BP again remained low after pt appropriately
paced at 80bpm and required 20mc/kg/min of dopamine to maintain
MAP >65.

[**2198-7-18**] Chest x-ray 11:40am
A permanent pacemaker has been placed with leads overlying
expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, with
no evidence of pneumothorax. Right-sided temporary pacing lead
has been removed with residual vascular sheath remaining in
place. Minor left basilar atelectasis has developed. No
additional changes are evident compared to the recent chest
radiograph.
.
[**2198-7-18**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or  color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 86 yo female with history of coronary artery disease s/p
CABG, DMII, HTN, and tachy/brady syndrome who presented with
bradycardia and dizziness.  Hospital course by problem:
.
#) Rhythm: Bradycardia likely due to tachy/brady syndrome and
exacerbated by combination of renal insufficiency, atenolol
acumulation and amiodarone use.  A temporary pacing wire was
placed on the day of admission.  A permanent pacemaker was
placed on the second day of admission.  Amiodarone and atenolol
were intially held.  After the pacemaker was placed the patient
was started on Toprol XL and amiodarone.  The atenolol was not
continued.  The patient should followup with EP as instructed.
.
#) CAD: Pt has known history of CAD with mild elevation in
troponin in the setting of ARF and possible new ECG changes of
inf TWI.  We continued the patient's aspirin and statin but held
her B-blockade as the patient was likely presenting with
atenolol toxicity.  The ACEI was held in the setting of acute
renal failure.  It was restarted upon discharge.  Per
presentation was thought not to be [**3-2**] ischemia.
.
#) Pump: Pt SOB likely mulifactorial but some component of
cardiogenic shock from bradycardia. An echo revealed fairly
normal pump function with LVEF of >55%.  The patient was
intially on dopamine in the setting of hypotension, that was
likely caused by oversedation during intubation.  The dopamine
was easily weened on the second day of admission.
.
#) Respiratory failure:  The patient was intubated to protect
her airway in the setting of respiratory distress asociated with
placement of the temp wire.  The patient has no known intrinsic
lung disease and so was easily extubatable on the second day of
admission.
.
#) Hyperlipidemia: Continued on out patient ezetimibe and
lipitor.
.
#) DM: We held the patient's sulfonylureas and covered her with
glargine 5u qhs and a humalog SS.
