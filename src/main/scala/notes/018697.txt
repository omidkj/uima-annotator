Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 67 yo M w/PMHx sx for COPD and tobacco use who presented to
an OSH today after a neighbor found him to be very dyspneic. Per
report, pt had been sick for three weeks with weakness and
fever, with a productive cough with yellow sputum production,
chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, and difficulty breathing.
He also noted chest pressure. Per family friend, patient had
lost 20 lbs over this time course, and was using only [**Last Name (un) 18774**]
Vaporub for relief, and Tylenol PM for sleep.
.
Patient was brought today to the OSH by his girlfriend. [**Name (NI) **]
report, patient had temperature to 101, with HR 120s, with O2
sats of 96% on 6L, with progressively increasing tachypnea and
cyanosis on presentation to the OSH. Patient was intubated at
OSH for hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be [**2-18**]
pneumonia. His ABG was initially 7.19/110/278 on a
nonrebreather, then 7.24/96/67 on 2L NC prior to intubation.
Patient was also noted to have a leukocytosis with WBC of 24,
with left shift and 1% bandemia, and a CXR which per report
showed a LLL PNA. With the intubation patient received propofol,
which resulted in hypotension, for which he was started on
dopamine. At the OSH, patient also received one dose of
levofloxacin. A subclavian line was placed as well. Patient was
also noted to have dark emesis/hemoptysis with NGT placement,
and protonix was started.
.
In the ED, patient had repeat CXR performed. His initial BPs
were 70/50s. A FAST scan was performed, and was negative. He was
transitioned off propofol and dopamine and started on levophed.

Patient has received 4L IVF as well, as well as
CTX/azithromycin, and dexamethasone 10 mg x 1 dose.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain as patient intubated.

[**2124-3-15**] CT chest/abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Densely calcified pancreas, consistent with chronic calcific
pancreatitis.
2. Poorly-defined multifocal patchy, nodular opacities seen
distributed throughout the lungs bilaterally, with upper lobe
predominance. Findings are nonspecific but could be of
infectious or possibly inflammatory etiology.
3. Emphysema.
4. Enlarged left adrenal gland, incompletely evaluated on this
single-phase study.
5. Small low attenuation lesion seen within the left kidney,
possibly representing cyst but too small to characterize by CT.
6. Low attenuation lesion seen in the anterior subcutaneous soft
tissue, possibly representing sebaceous cyst. Clinical
correlation recommended.
7. No definite evidence malignancy identified on this study,
however, this study was only performed with a single phase of
contrast, limiting assessment for more subtle lesions,
especially within the liver.
.
LIVER AND GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND: Liver is of normal
echogenicity and echotexture and no focal lesions are
identified. No intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation. The
CBD measures 4 mm and is normal. All the hepatic vessels are
patent including the hepatic arteries, portal veins, and hepatic
veins. The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones.
.
[**3-21**] CT chest: FINDINGS:
As compared to the prior study, there has been interval
worsening of the multifocal areas of peribronchial consolidation
in the upper lobes bilaterally. Mild peribronchial infiltration
in the lingula, right middle lobe, and lower lobes, and two more
discrete nodular focal opacities in the right lower lobe (3A:
44) are unchanged. Bibasal posterior subsegmental atelectasis
are new.
A focal area of consolidation in the superior segment of the
left lower lobe posteriorly is new.
The airways are patent through the segmental level. There has
been interval increase in size and number of multiple
mediastinal lymph nodes, for instance, an 11-mm right lower
paratracheal lymph node was 9 mm previously; a 9-mm left lower
paratracheal lymph node was 6 mm in the past. Bilateral mildly
enlarged hilar lymph nodes are stable. Cardiac size is normal.
Dense calcification is seen in the right brachiocephalic artery.
There is no pericardial effusion. A small layering left pleural
effusion is new.
There are no bone findings of malignancy.
In the upper abdomen, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, and right
adrenal gland are unremarkable. The left adrenal gland remains
enlarged measuring up to 26 mm. Dense calcifications through the
pancreas are again noted. Previously described small cortical
lesions in the kidneys are not seen on this nonenhanced study.
There is a trace of ascites. Diffuse increase in density of the
mesentery and subcutaneous fat in the abdomen could be due to
anasarca. The 25 x 30 mm low-attenuation oval-shaped lesion in
the anterior subcutaneous abdominal wall is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo with h/o COPD, alcoholism, prsented to OSH with several
weeks of fever, productive cough, hemoptysis and weight loss. In
the OSH intubated for hypercarbic resp failure and transferred
here. He got solumedrol and levaquin. He self-extubated [**3-13**] but
did well and was transferred to floor. Despite improvement he
still had a leukocytosis with immature forms. A chest CT was
notable for diffuse bronchiolitis. Of note a tracheal aspirate
grew aspergillus.  Patient had multiple AFBs sent that remained
negative (cultures can be followed up later but no growth now)
and negative PPD so taken off TB precautions.  Patient HIV
negative, HCV negative, HBV negative.  Patient started
empirically under the guidance of ID and pulmonary on
voriconazole.  Also given albuterol/atrovent nebs.  Also given
10 days of levofloxacin empirically.  Patient also had
persistent diarrhea with multiple negative c diffs.
.
# Pneumonia: Seen by pulmonary and ID.  Believe to have
aspergillous bronchiolitis.  Started on voriconazole and began
to improve.  Unclear how long course should be.  Should be seen
by ID consult at [**Hospital1 1501**] and can contact ID group here at [**Hospital1 18**] for
further discussion.  Cont pulmonary PT. With concern for
cirrhosis (although none seen on ultrasound) should get weekly
LFTs (have been normal here).  Recommend repeat CT scan chest in
3 weeks to watch progression of d
