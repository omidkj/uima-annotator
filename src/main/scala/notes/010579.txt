 AP CXR [**2202-7-19**]: Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is
reviewed, and compared to the previous study of [**2202-7-12**].

There is continued mild cardiomegaly. There is improving left
lower lobe patchy atelectasis. The lungs are clear otherwise.
Again, note is made of biapical thickening. The left subclavian
IV catheter terminates in the SVC. No pneumothorax is
identified.

Continued mild cardiomegaly. Otherwise, no active lung disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] was admitted with a block port a catheter which was
being used for IV gentamycin to treat a reported urinary tract
infection which was diagnosed at [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital.  He
has a history of recurrent Pseudomonas urinary tract infections
which are resistant to all antibiotics except Tobramycin and
Gentamycin.  He recently completed a course of meropenem and
tobramycin for pseudomonal UTI. A repeat urinalysis was still
found to have evidence of infection and a course of gentamycin
was intitiated.  Patient subsequrntly developed a RUQ fluid
collestion, and urosepsis.

1. port a cath: Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] has had 6 port-a catheters, the last
five of which were placed by surgery.  The catheter was flushed
with t-pa at the rehabilitation hospital where Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] lives
with no improvement.  The catheter was flushed with normal
saline by the IV team but they were unable to pass sufficient
saline to warrant an attempt to flush with t-pa.  Patient was
seen by surgery to evaluate the [**Doctor First Name **], and for new port a catheter
placement.  Vein mapping and venous ultrasound were performed,
and a new port a cath placed [**6-8**].  He was started on warfarin
with a gola INR [**1-14**] to be contiunued for 3 months.  Pt has
allergy to heparin and can not have hep flushes.
.
2. Urinary tract infection: The patient has a history of chronic
infections with pseudomonas and Morganella morganii.  It is
unclear if this is actually a recurrent problem or if the
patient is colonized.  Patient reported increasing abdominal
pain on [**2202-6-17**].  CT abd/pelvis did not show any acute pathology.
 Patient has completed 14d of tobramyacin. Subsequently on
[**2202-7-12**], patient developed hypotension and transient hypoxia.
Hypotension persisted after treatment with 2L NS, and treatment
with dilaudid (? Narcotic effect). This occurred in setting of
bladder catheter flushing. Patient's Urine Culture and blood
cultures were drawn and paitient was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids. Patint was taken to
the MICU (See MICU course below) and his urine Ux grew
Morganella. Patient started promptly dcd from ICU and will
continue on Meropenum, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Flagyl for a
total of 14 days, as well as a steroid taper.
.
3. Chronic sacral decubitus ulcer: a chronic problem for this
patient given his paraplegia.  He arrived being treated with
twice daily irrigations and dressing changes with xeroform
adhesive.  Regular positional changes were ordered and special
matress was ordered.

4. Autonomic dysreflexia: The patient is known to have wide
swings in blood pressure secondary to this disorder.  as
mentioned above, his blood pressure seems to respond most
efefctively to IV fluid boluses, which is one of the reasons why
regular reliable IV access is so important for this patient.  He
required several NS fluid boluses during his stay for
hypotension.
.
5. Abdominal pain - Pt had persistant RLQ pain during his
hospital stay.  Patient had a a drain placed in the RUQ for
fluid collection noted on CT  the abdomen. On [**2202-7-8**], this
drain was discontineud. Subsequently, patient had recollection
of RUQ fluid and underwent surgical I and D on [**2202-7-17**]. Repeat CT
on [**2202-7-19**] (Perlim read) revealed no recollection offluid.
.
6.Anemia - Chronic in nature.  Ferritin low and tarted on oral
iron supplements.  Stool remained guiac negative.

7. Left arm swelling - R
