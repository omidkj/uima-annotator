Admission Date:  [**2111-12-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2111-12-29**]

Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

ADDENDUM COVERING HOSPITAL COURSE FROM [**Date range (3) 33536**]:
1) GI/NUTRITION:  The patient continued to tolerate her tube
feeds well during this time.  Her nasojejunal feeding tube
came out during this time period, likely in a moment of
disorientation on the patient's part.  It was easily replaced
without incident, and feedings were restarted at that time.
It will be important to make sure that the tube is
well-secured during the period that the patient requires
these feedings.  She continued to have her chronic nausea and
occasional vomiting, as well.  This was essentially unchanged
from baseline and was able to be treated with antiemetic
medication, such as compazine.  The patient should be
encouraged to take ad lib POs, in addition to her tube feeds.
A soft low-residue diet was recommended, along with Boost
supplementation as tolerated.  The patient will follow-up
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12589**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22318**] on [**2112-1-5**] for gastroenterology
follow-up.

2) PAIN CONTROL:  The patient has chronic neuropathic pain
which continued to be well-controlled with the addition of
nortriptyline 10 mg hs.  In addition, the patient remained on
MS-Contin and morphine po for breakthrough, along with Midrin
for her chronic headaches.  One might consider, over the
long-term, trying to wean the patient off of the opiate
regimen, as this may be contributing to her chronic nausea.

3) PULMONARY:  The patient had one episode of desaturation on
[**2111-12-26**].  The cause of this was unclear, maybe possible
fluid overload.  However, a chest x-ray did not show any
evidence of infiltrate or CHF.  Nonetheless, the patient
initially responded well with her oxygenation returning to
normal.  She was started on low-dose lasix, and she continued
to have a decreasing oxygen requirement over the remainder of
her stay and had no complaints of respiratory distress
whatsoever.  We believe this to be an isolated incident, not
something which requires chronic monitoring.  In addition,
she was pancultured.  Urine cultures and blood cultures were
sent, and they did not reveal any sources of infection, and
she remained afebrile during the rest of her stay and did not
require any further antibiotic treatment.  In addition, at
that time she had a CTA which was negative for any new PEs.
It did show improvement of her known old PE from
approximately 1 month ago.  The patient remains
anticoagulated with Lovenox, as well as continues to have an
IVC filter in place for prevention of further pulmonary
emboli.

4) SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS/ANTICARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY
POSITIVE:  As noted above, the patient is anticoagulated with
Lovenox and has an IVC filter in place.  She had been off of
her Coumadin for possible J-tube placement, but surgical
opinion was that she needed to have much improved nutrition
before any surgery was to be performed.  So, her Coumadin was
restarted on the day of discharge and once therapeutic, she
can be removed from the Lovenox.  She will require monitoring
of her INR to determine when her Coumadin will be at a
therapeutic level.  She continued on prednisone for her
previously diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus, and she
will have a follow-up appointment with rheumatology on
[**2111-12-31**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 3748**] in the [**Hospital Ward Name **] Bldg, 5th Fl., at
[**Hospital1 18**].  The patient also has a hematology appointment with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**] on [**2112-1-22**] at 10:00 am.

5) ANEMIA:  The patient does have a chronic anemia, and she
is being treated with folate with B12 injections with
thiamine, as well.  The source is not entirely clear.
However, her hematocrit has remained essentially stable over
the past 5 days.  It should be checked in 3 days to confirm
that there has been no further drop in hematocrit from her
baseline of 26-30.

6) HYPOTHYROID:  The patient is on levothyroxine 75 mcg qd.
This was adjusted several weeks ago when her TSH had been
suppressed.  A repeat TSH was within normal limits.  It
probably bears rechecking in several weeks and adjusting the
dose of the levothyroxine as necessary.

7) PSYCH:  The patient is maintained on a number of
psychotropic medications including mirtazapine, buspirone and
nortriptyline.  These medications were essentially stable
throughout her stay, with the exception of the nortriptyline
which was added to ease her neuropathic pain, and this should
be continued.
