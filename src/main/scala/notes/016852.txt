IMPRESSION:
1. Small linear anterior bladder wall defect significantly
smaller than the prior study without associated extravasation of
contrast in the perivesical region.
2. Partially imaged right renal lower pole cyst, incompletely
characterized in the non-contrast imaging, however, based on
prior imaging, likely represents a simple cyst.
