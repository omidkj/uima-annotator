ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Motor vehicle trauma

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 6483**] is a 48 year old
female who was the unrestrained driver in a motor vehicle
accident where the car struck a tractor-trailer which was
parked in the break-down [**Male First Name (un) **].  She was "partying" and was
intoxicated at the time with ethyl alcohol and opiates on
board.  She was trapped within the vehicle and it was a
difficult extrication.  She was first brought to [**Hospital 8641**]
Hospital in [**Location (un) 3844**] for stabilization.  She underwent a
preliminary workup there which included an inadequate
cervical spine, chest x-ray which showed multiple left-sided
rib fractures and an inadequate pelvis x-ray.  No
computerized tomography scans were performed.  She denied any
loss of consciousness and was Medflighted to the [**Hospital6 1760**] directly from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital
for evaluation of multiple head and face injuries.  She
arrived at the [**Hospital6 256**] with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 15 out of 15.

PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, appendectomy, diverticulosis
with diverticulitis, lower back pain, pilonidal cyst.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prilosec, Prinivil, Albuterol and
Atrovent, Serevent, and Vicodin

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination at the time
she was afebrile with stable vital signs.  In general she was
obese, intoxicated with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] coma scale of 15.  Her
head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was significant
for a 10 to 15 cm laceration of the posterior scalp over the
occiput through the galea down to the skull.  She had right
raccoon eye, right eyebrow 2 cm laceration, nasal bridge 1 cm
laceration.  Her right pupil was reactive 3 to 2 mm.  Her
left pupil was reactive 4 to 3 mm.  Her neck was in a
cervical spine collar with the trachea midline.  Her chest
was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  She had no sternal
tenderness.  Her cardiac examination was regular rate and
rhythm.  Her abdomen was obese, nontender, nondistended.  Her
pelvis was stable.  Her rectal was normal tone, no stools.
Her extremities, right shoulder demonstrated 1 to 2 cm
laceration over the deltoid.  Her left and right upper
extremities had full range of motion, 5/5 strength.  Her left
and right lower extremity showed full range of motion with
5/5 strength.  Her left upper elbow had significant
ecchymosis and tenderness.

LABORATORY DATA:  Her admission hematocrit was 41.6 with
white count of 21.7.  Her coags were within normal limits as
were her chem-7 with a BUN of 14, creatinine 0.6.  Her urine
toxicology demonstrated opiates and alcohol.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  At this time it was felt that this was a 49
year old female in an unrestrained motor vehicle accident who
had sustained multiple soft tissue and likely skeletal
injuries who was stable in the trauma bay.  She was
transferred to the computerized axial tomography scanner for
further workup.

A trauma series was first performed which was significant for
the following:  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax with
clear lungs, no fractures documented.  The patient was taken
to the computerized axial tomography scanner where multiple
radiographic studies were performed including a computerized
tomography scan of the head which demonstrated no masses,
midline shift or hemorrhage, normal ventricles, no extra
axial fluid collections, significant right orbital soft
tissue swelling with fractures of the lamina papyracea,
medial orbital wall and opacification of the right-sided
ethmoid air cells.  There was intracaudal air as well as
extracaudal air. A small portion of the medial rectus muscle
was immediately adjacent to the lamina fracture and it
appeared that it could be partially entrapped.  There was
opacification with bony fragments in the maxillary sinus,
worrisome for an inferior orbital fracture.  There was fluid
within the sphenoid sinuses suggesting fracture fragments and
of the sinus cells as well.  Bilateral nasal bone fractures
were noted with slight medial displacement.  There was also a
fracture of the nasal septum.  The globes were both intact.
There was a large scalp laceration with subcutaneous
emphysema and skin thickening and also a subgluteal hematoma
within the right posterior higher convexities.  The cervical
spine was notable for no fractures or dislocations from C7 to
T1.  The prevertebral soft tissues were normal.  There were
multiple degenerative changes most pronounced at C4-5 and
C5-6.  The were visualized aspects of the cervical cord were
unremarkable as were the lung apices.  The patient
subsequently underwent a computerized tomography scan of the
torso and pelvis that was significant for the following:
Great vessels, trachea, esophagus and heart were
unremarkable.  There was a right-sided aortic arch noted.
Incidentally there was no mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy, no pleural effusion pneumothorax.  There
were bibasilar posterior opacifications suggestive of
dependent atelectasis.  There was no pneumothorax and no
pulmonary infiltrates.  The liver, spleen, pancreas,
gallbladder, adrenals and kidneys were all normal.  There was
no free fluid.  The pelvis demonstrated an intact bladder
with no free fluid within the cul-de-sac.  Osseous structures
were normal.  There were no refractures noted.  The patient
underwent multiple radiographic films including the shoulder,
chest and elbow as follows:  The shoulder showed no fractures
visible; the elbow demonstrated normal alignment and
articulation without any fractures.  The patient was
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further
observation.  An ophthalmology consult was obtained.  Their
evaluation was notable for no diplopia and no evidence of
medial rectus entrapment.  An oromaxillofacial surgery
consult was obtained for the orbital fractures which
requested a orbital computerized tomography scan for further
evaluation and the patient was noted to have a very large
scalp avulsion type injury which was irrigated in the
Intensive Care Unit with 1 liter of normal saline,
infiltrated with lidocaine.  The galea was reapproximated
with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was
reapproximated with a combination of staples and 2-0 nylon
sutures.  Also at that time, the right shoulder and right
eyebrow lacerations as well as the nasal laceration were
reapproximated using Prolene.  The patient also had a
Neurosurgery consult.  A re-evaluation of the patient's
computerized tomography scan demonstrated a right lamina
process T9 fracture.  For these reasons, the patient was
placed on log-roll precautions.  The patient was in the
surgical Intensive Care Unit for one day and was transferred
to the regular floor on hospital day #2.  She underwent an
magnetic resonance imaging scan at this time of her thoracic
spine which was inadequate.  She was evaluated by
Neurosurgery who deemed that her thoracic spine could be
cleared with flexion, extension views.  She underwent
flexion, extension views on hospital day #4 which were normal
and hence her thoracic spine was clear.  She also underwent a
repeat computerized tomography scan of the orbits and sella
which demonstrated both medial and inferior wall blow-out
fractures.  Oromaxillofacial surgery was notified and the
decision was made to have her follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23170**] in
his clinic during the following week for discussions about
repair of the orbital fractures.  The patient had been placed
on Clindamycin prophylactically for her fractures.  At this
point she was doing well, ambulating, tolerating a regular
diet.  It was felt that she was stable for discharge.  Her
family was present and wanting to take her home.
