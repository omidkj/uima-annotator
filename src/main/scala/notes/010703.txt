Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
intubated for fever, hypercarbic resp failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Insertion of left internal jugular central venous line.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64 y/o M hx CAD, DM, HTN, ESRD on HD and MMP who
presents with fever and dyspnea. Per OMR records and his wife,
pt had been feeling his usul self until last dialysis on Friday
after which he had a temperature 101, new SOB, drowsiness. He
also has a cough which is new. Pt sig SOB walking up 1
flight--usual not difficult for him; and difficult
talking--usually not difficult for him. Otherwise, he denied any
chest pain, abd pain, no N/V/F/C.
.
In the ED, 100.2, 77, 101/77, 13 , 88% RA -> 100% NRB. He was
complaining of bilateral leg pain and given dilaudid 1mg IV.
Shortly afterwards, he became increasingly somnolent. An ABG was
7.29/71/67 and as he became less arousable, he was intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure and transferred to MICU. He also
received Ceftriaxone 1gm IV, Azithryomycin 500 mg PO.
.
On the floor, he is intubated and minimally responsive.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO on [**2166-4-2**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The left  ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic  function is severely
depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. [Intrinsic
right ventricular  systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid  regurgitation.] The aortic root
is moderately dilated athe sinus level. The  aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are  moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+]  tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2166-2-7**],
mitral
regurgitation is now slightly more prominent. Ventricular
function appears similar.

CXR on [**2166-3-31**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Left IJ line, with tip projecting over the junction of
brachiocephalic and subclavian veins.  No pneumothorax.
2.  Unchanged appearance of cardiomegaly and mild CHF.
3.  Apparent overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff, as on
the earlier
study.

CXR on [**2166-3-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Dilated pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary
hypertension.
2.  Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged.  Mild [**Date Range 1106**]
engorgement, perhaps
indicating early CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 M with CAD, DM, HTN, ESRD on HD, admitted for community
acquired pna and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure
due to dilaudid-induced somnolence, now extubated, with
persistent somnolence initially on floor, now improved
postdialysis.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Patient came to the ED for
sx of fever and productive cough, however, in the ED received IV
dilaudid for chronic leg pain.  In the ED he became somnolent
with decreased respiratory drive and blood gas revealed
hypercarbia with pCO2 of 71.  He was intubated and admitted to
the MICU on [**3-31**] and was extubated [**4-1**]. Although he remained
somnolent following extubation and transfer to the floor, his
blood gas was improved althoug pCO2 elevated to low 50s (Patient
does have a h/o COPD and in review of his labs, his unintubated
pCO2 fluctuates from normal to low 50s).  He also has been
diagnosed with OSA and used CPAP while here (despite not using
it at home) so as not to worsen his hypercarbia.
.
# Community-acquired pneumonia:  Although there was noo clear
infiltrate on CXR, he presented with increased productive cough
and fever.  He was started on ceftriaxone, azithromycin and
vancomycin.  During his stay on the floor, he remained afebrile
and without elevated WBC count.  His cough improved.  He
received one week of vancomycin, completed his course of
azithromycin and was discharged to complete a 10 day course of
cefpodoxime.
.
# Somnolence:  Despite holding all narcotics upon transfer to
the floor, he had been receiving prn IV dilaudid in the MICU.
He remained somnolent, falling asleep during his exam.  ABG
revealed elevated pCO2, but had been awake with the same pCO2
just the day prior so it seemed less likely [**3-7**] to his
hypercarbia.  However, CPAP was initiated at night, given his
h/o OSA so as not to precipitate worsening hypercarbia.  All
narcotics were held for concern of his clearance.  His BUN was
in the mid 20s and he had been getting regularly dialyzed so it
also did not appear to be uremia.  Given his h/o hepatitis C,
LFTs were obtained which were normal with the exception of alk
phos which appears chronically elevated upon review of old labs.
 Given his cleared mental status as below, ammonia was not sent.
 He was also on neurontin which can be sedating, but he had been
on this stable dose for an extended period of time despite his
ESRD (because on HD) and had not had problems previously.
Interestingly, however, his mental status cleared following
hemodialysis so perhaps medications lingering were causing
somnolence and were cleared with dialysis.  He will not be
discharged home on narcotics nor neurontin so his lower
extremity pain control will have to be addressed upon follow up.
.
# Hypotensive episodes: He had episodes of hypotension in the
MICU.  Etiology appeared multifactorial, related to receiving
dilaudid IV in ED, partly related to hypovolemia associated with
HD, as well as likely autonomic dysfunction associated with DM2.
He was started on midodrine to which his BP responded well.
Midodrine was discontinued on the floor and his BPs remained
stable.

# Cardiac:
Pump: EF 20% in TTE [**2166-4-1**], has been chronically 20-30% for the
past year. Also has 3+TR, [**2-4**]+MR,
