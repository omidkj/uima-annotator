History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8182**] is a 41yo gentleman with recently diagnosed
HIV/AIDS (CD 4 count 26, VL 528,000 in [**2147-10-22**]) and multiple
admissions for PCP pneumonia who presents with fevers and
dyspnea on exertion.

He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 54870**] with severe
PCP pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Although he was
markedly hypoxic on admission, he quickly improved and was
extubated. He was discharged home on 2 more weeks of
treatment-dose bactrim as well as a prednisone taper, both of
which he completed the day prior to presentation, [**12-14**]. He
reports that he was compliant with his medications and did not
have trouble with obtaining the meds. He also reports compliance
with his HAART regimen, though it appears he missed his
appointment on [**12-4**] with ID. He does not recall knowing that he
had this appointment scheduled.

For the first week after discharge, he was feeling reasonably
well. He was able to go to work, although he would have trouble
climbing stairs. By the second week, he noticed he was having
fevers to 102 at home. He then developed some worsening
shortness of breath with exertion. A couple of days ago, he
started having a cough productive of white sputum. He endorses
feeling chilled. He also recently had a fever blister on his
bottom lip. Otherwise, he denies myalgias, headache, congestion,
sore throat, neck stiffness, pleuritic chest pain, abdominal
pain, N/V/D, dysuria, genital sores, rash, or joint pain.

In the emergency department 103.8 102/46 138 30s 89% RA->97% on
4L. Exam was notable for crackles at his bases. Labs revealed a
lactate of 2.1. CXR showed b/l patchy infiltrates, improved from
prior. He received solumedrol 125mg, vancomycin, cefepime,
levaquin, and bactrim. He was admitted to the ICU for care
because of his poor respiratory status.

Upon arrival to the ICU, he had no complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old man with HIV (CD4 26) and recent severe PCP
pneumonia who was readmitted with recurrent fever, DOE, and
cough after initial significant improvement. He was completely
compliant with, and had already finished, his full Bactrim
treatment on [**2147-12-15**]. The initial suspicion for this
presentation was either relapsed PCP or CAP. However, recurrent
or relapsed PCP has only been described in few case reports. He
initially received empiric treatment with broad spectrum
antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin), and repeat
full does Bactrim and prednisone for presumed relapsed PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations included CMV pneumonitis, fungal infection,
other opportunistic infections, or LIP. His first BAL from his
last admission was positive for CMV-like particles but his serum
CMV viral load was negative at that time. He was not treated for
CMV pneumonitis during his first hospitalization (controversial
in HIV/AIDS patients). During this admission, an induced sputum
and repeat bronchoscopy/BAL for PCP were both negative.
Influenza DFA, cryptococcal antigen, and legionella urine
antigen were also negative. A HRCT of the chest showed diffuse
ground glass opacities in both lungs (nonspecific but consistent
with PCP) and less consolidation than previous CT chest (done
during the initial presentation). The BAL, however, was positive
for RSV and he was placed on respiratory precautions (no
specific treatment available). His repeat CMV viral load became
positive at >10.000 copies per ML. Therefore, he was placed on
Ganciclovir to treat presumed CMV pneumonitis ( again its
controversial whether he has CMV pneumonitis or its a clinically
insignificant finding as clinical CMV in AIDS patients is less
defined than transplant patients). His full dose Bactrim and
steroids were discontinued and was placed on prophylactic dose
of Bactrim. Because of 2 negative PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (sputum and BAL),
the likelihood of recurrent/relapsed PCP became even less. His
recurrent symptoms were believed to be secondary to intercurrent
HSV infection or CVM pneumonitis and not recurrent/relapsed PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the other hand, if her does not improve, he may need
bronchoscopy with lung biopsy to rule out LIP or other
AIDS-associated lung diseases. The patient developed
hyponatremia related to SIADH from lung disease. He was placed
on fluid restriction and his sodium normalized. He was advised
to have biweekly CHEM 7 and CBC while on anti CMV treatment and
fax the results to the [**Hospital **] clinic. The duration of anti-CMV
treatment is controversial and the ID doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] decide based
on his symptoms during follow up. He has intermittent fever that
is treated with Tylenol.

The patient has hyponatremia secondary to SIADH from pulmonary
disease (recent PCP infection and now RSV/CMV infection).  He is
very sensitive to fluid intake.  He should have fluid
restriction of 750cc-1000cc daily until his SIADH improves.
Sodium level should be monitored closely until sodium level
becomes normal and stable.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for pulmonary
rehabilitation.
