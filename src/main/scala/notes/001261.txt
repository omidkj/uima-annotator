History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 45209**] is a 43F with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis s/p
TIPS 6 weeks ago (gradient 17->10), active alcoholism, and
recect UGIB attributed to duodenal varix who was discharged
[**2164-1-16**] after IR guided embolization of a sentinel bleed from a
duodenal varix. During her most recent admission the pt was
tachycardic, hypotensive and required multiple blood
transfusions and underwent EGD that showed only mild portal
gastropathy and colonoscopy that showed a large volume of blood
in the colon and grade 1 external/internal hemorrhoids. She
subsequently underwent CTA that showed duodenal varicies that
were embolized.

Following this, patient was in her normal state of health until
she started having BRBPR as well as light-headedness and
presented to OSH where she had a crit of 18.8 blood [**Month/Day/Year **] of 279.
She was also found to be hypotensive to as low as 80/44 but was
said to be mentating well. She was given 1 unit of FFP, 1 unit
of pRBC's, started on an octreotide drip, and given 1 dose of
40mg IV pantoprazole and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and management.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  98.9 118 84/55 12 100% RA
She was noted to have BRBPR on rectal exam as well as dark blood
from her vagina, pelvic exam was significant for dark red blood
from her cervical os, she was dosed with IV 2gram Ceftriaxone,
continued on her octreotide drip, and had blood from OSH
hanging. Her crit was 22.3 (baseline mid 20's), PLT ct of 44
(fluctuates between 40's and low 120's), lactate of 2.5, Serum
[**Hospital1 **] of 164, Cr of 0.7. Prior to transfer to the MICU her BP was
98/54.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is alert and confirms the above
history. She states that she had the sudden onset of BRBPR along
with the feeling of generalized weakness. She denies significant
abdominal pain although described mild abdominal discomfort such
as hunger cramps. No N/V/D, no hematemesis, states she has had a
few recent falls related to her generalized weakness and perhaps
her [**Hospital1 **] intake. She denies LOC but did hit her nose on her
coffee table and had a minor nose bleed. Otherwise describes no
blood in her urine but has had small amounts of dark blood from
her vagina but states that she hasn??????t had an ordinary period in
over a year. She denies fevers, chills, CP, SOB, focal numbness,
weakness, or tingling.

IMAGING:
[**2164-2-20**] RUQ US FINDINGS: The liver is diffusely echogenic,
consistent with chronic liver disease. There is a simple hepatic
cyst in the left lobe measuring 2.5 cm.  The spleen is enlarged
measuring 15 cm. There is no ascites.
COLOR FLOW AND PULSE WAVE DOPPLER: The TIPS shunt is widely
patent with
wall-to-wall flow throughout. The flow velocities in the
proximal, mid and
distal portion of the TIPS shunt are 55.1, 180, and 116 cm/sec
respectively.  These velocities previously were 133, 157 and 105
cm/sec respectively. The main portal vein has normal hepatopetal
flow. There is stable, expected reversal of flow within the left
portal vein. The right portal vein is patent. The hepatic veins
are patent.
IMPRESSION: Patent TIPS shunt with wall-to-wall flow throughout.

[**2164-2-20**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube ends approximately 6.3 cm from the
carina, just above the level of medial heads of the clavicles.
Consider advancing the ET tube by another 2.5 cm for a better
seating. Bilateral lungs are remarkable for mild pulmonary
vascular conge
