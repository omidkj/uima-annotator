Chief Complaint: Vomiting, dehydration

Central Venous line Placement
Arterial Line placement


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 69yoF w/ h/o of IDDM with no prior episodes of DKA, HTN,
PVD, and celiac disease who presented with 4 days of n/v.  She
also reports poor PO intake over the past several days (has not
been able to tolerate even fluids), lightheadedness, dry mouth,
visual changes x 2 days (objects look "bright" and slightly
blurry).  Pt reports that she has been using her insulin, but
has not checked fingersticks x 4 d after her glucometer stopped
working.  In addition, she has not taken PO meds x 2-3 days.

The pt has also has had some back pain after falling 1 1/2 weeks
ago, but Xray at her PCP's showed no fractures.  She denied any
diarrhea or fevers.  Her last BM wasa typical solid BM 2 days
ago.  She denied chest pain and SOB although her sister noted
that her breathing was more labored than usual.

In the ED, the patient was hypotensive with SBPs in the 60s and
appeared confused.  She received 4L IVF with poor response;
therefore, a L IJ was placed and the patient was started on
Levophed.  Her physical exam was notable for diffuse abdominal
tenderness and crackles bilaterally.  Labs were notable for
blood sugar 825 so patient was started on an insulin gtt. Na
123, K 6.2, bicarb 6, Cre 3.3, AG 36, and lactate 3.1.  WBC was
19.8 and blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.  The
patient was also started on UA showed 1000 glucose, 10 ketones,
33 WBC and moderate bacteria with no nitrates and moderate leuk
esterase. In the ED, the patient was started on vanc.

Labs were also notable for a Trop-T of 0.78 and a proBNP 3933
even though the patient has no history of CHF.  EKG showed sinus
rhythm with TW changes in AVL and ST depression in leads II and
V3-V5; these findings are different from her old EKG.

En route to the MICU, the patient's vitals were HR 82 BP 100/39
100% on 2L.

Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient's vitals were HR 99 BP
95/42 100% on 2L.  The patient received a repeat EKG confirmed
TWI and ST depressions seen in the ED.

Prior to discharge:
=======================

Imaging:
=========================
TTE [**2156-6-1**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the apical
half of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and lateral
wall, with focal apical dyskinesis. The rest of the left
ventricular segments appear hyperdynamic without outflow tract
obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Renal U/S [**2156-5-31**]:
Limited study.  No evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, or mass in

either kidney.

CXR [**2156-5-31**]:
Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Low lung
volumes noted.  Allowing for this, the lungs appear clear.  No
large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
silhouette appears normal.  A calcified granuloma projects over
the right lateral mid lung.  Bony structures are intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
=======================================
Ms [**Known lastname 26077**] is a 69yoF with a history of Type 1 Diabetes and HTN
who presented with nausea and vomiting found to have DKA, a UTI,
and elevated Troponin

ACTIVE ISSUES:
=====================
1.) Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient was admitted to the MICU
and was placed on an insulin drip. She was hypotensive and
required aggressive fluid repletion. After her anion gap was
closed she was transitioned back to SC insulin and transferred
to the medical floor. The precipitating factor for her DKA was
most likely a urinary tract infection although alternatively it
could have been that the cardiac event triggered the DKA and the
UTI is incidental.
-The patient's home insulin regimen was modified in consultation
with [**Last Name (un) **]. NPH was changed to 26 U AM and 6 U PM.
-She will follow-up closely with her endocrinologist at [**Last Name (un) **]

2.) NSTEMI / cardiomyopathy: In the MICU the patient was noted
to have EKG changes and her troponin was as high as 3. Initially
there was concern for an acute coronary syndrome; however she
subsequently had an echocardiogram which showed apical
hypokinesis consistent with TakoTsubo/Stress Induced
Cardiomyopathy. This was likely due to physiologic stress from
the DKA and profound volume depletion. The patient's cardiac
biomarkers began to trend downwards without any coronary
intervention. She never had chest pain at any point.
Alternatively these EKG changes and biomarker elevations could
be explained by a mid LAD infarction but this was deemed less
likely based on patient's history. Cardiology was consulted who
recommended that the patient continue aspirin and atorvastatin
that she was already on.
-Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] will see patient in cardiology clinic in ~3 weeks
and will repeat an echocardiogram to assess for recovery of LV
function and to determine whether further risk stratification
(e.g. stress testing) is warranted.

3.) UTI: Cultures grew E
