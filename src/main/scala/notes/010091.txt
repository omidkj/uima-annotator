History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58M with history of NHL s/p chemo and chest XRT
in [**2117**], 70 pack year smoking history (quit 20 years ago), CAD,
recurrent right sided pneumonia (in [**2128**], [**2130**], and [**2131**] with
VATS/bronch in [**8-13**] revealing organizing fibrosis), who
presented on [**10-14**] with worsening hemoptysis. The patient has
had two hospitalizations in the past week for hemoptysis, during
which he was treated for right lower lobar PNA.
.
He was admitted on [**2131-10-7**]/11 with CT chest showing new right
lower lobe opacification abutting the paraesophageal
mediastinum. There was increased right paraesophageal, hilar and
left retrocural lymphadenopathy. He underwent bronchoscopy which
showed purulence in the right lower lobe, no evidence of
obstruction or bleeding, culture growing gram positive cocci,
and cytology negative for malignant cells. His hemoptysis
improved and he was discharged to complete a 14 day course of
levofloxacin and clindamycin. He returned home but produced
frank hemoptysis w/ clots shortly therafter, up to two cups in
one day, and was re-admitted from [**Date range (1) 87414**]. Chest CT on [**10-10**]
showed right lower lobar consolidation with central area of
hypoattenuation which could reflect necrosis. His antibiotics
were initially broadened, but was discharged on levoquin and
clindamycin given clinical improvement.  During this time, he
reports having low-grade fevers, with occasional cough. No
shaking chills or drenching sweats.
.
On [**10-14**], he again presented with hemoptysis, including an
episode of 2 cups volume in the ED. In the ED initial vitals
were: 97 62 142/78 18 98% 4L. CXR (PA/LAT) showed persistent but
slight improved aeration of opacity with no new opacities. He
was given clindamycin and levoquin IV and transferred to the
floor. On [**10-15**], the patient reportedly had ~500cc of hemoptysis
while ambulating with a concomitant desaturation to the 70%s.
His hemoptysis resolved without intervention. He was transferred
to the MICU for further care and received 1 unit x PRBC. The
patient was intubated for airway protection and had underwent an
IR embolization procedure on [**2132-10-15**]. He was extubated without
complication on [**2132-10-16**] and transferrred down to the floor on
[**2132-10-17**].
.
Pt currently denies any shortness of breath. Reports having a
sore throat from being intubated. Denies any lung or chest pain,
but reports chronic neck pain. States that he has had chronic
neck pain since a motor vehicle accident in [**2130**], after which he
has become dependent on high dose opiates (oxycontin 20mg plus
hydrocodone-acetaminophen 10/325 tid). Also reports intermittent
"heaviness in his sternum" after his embolization procedure, but
none currently.
.
Vitals on arrival: 98.9F, 140/80, 69, 18, 96% 2L.
.
ROS: low grade fevers per HPI. Weightloss, 215lb several months
ago, 205lb 3 wks prior to admission.
