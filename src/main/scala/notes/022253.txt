None.


History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with severe COPD on 4 L home O2 (FEV1 19%, FEV1/FVC 43%
in [**7-23**]), chronic systolic CHF (EF >55% on [**3-24**]), and h/o PE in
[**2-/2121**] on coumadin who presents with worsening shortness of
breath and hypoxia. The patient has had multiple hospital
admissions for COPD exacerbation and pulmonary infections. He
was most recently at [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital from [**5-5**] -
[**5-9**], and at [**Hospital **] Rehab after discharge. He was just
discharged from rehab yesterday.  He states he was acutely more
DOE this morning while walking to the bathroom. While he had
mild DOE at rehab, he states this was worse than usal. No direct
sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] snores at night, and states he has been sleepy
during the daytime.  He has never been evaluated for sleep apnea
in the past. His VNA came to evaluate him at home and noted that
he was more dyspneic with worsening hypoxia ([**Name (NI) 20358**] sats at
82%-79% that did not improve despite some chest PT and getting
patient out of bed.) His [**Name (NI) 20358**] saturations are usually in the
mid 80s on 4 L NC. His PCP was called, who advised him to go to
the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vs were: 99.2 103 152/75 20 88  Patient was
given albuterol and ipratroprium nebs x3, methylprednisolone 125
mg IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg PO x1. CXR showed small LLL
infiltrate, so was given IV Vancomycin 1 gram x1 and Zosyn IV
x1. He was noted when transferring rooms off of [**Name (NI) 20358**] to have
sats in the low 60%. He did not require BiPap in the ED. On
transfer, VS were afebrile, 96 125/57 24 85% on 5 L NCVS - 85%
on 5 L NC, HR 96 24 afebrile 125/57.

On the floor, patient is sitting in bed on nasal canula,
watching TV. He denies any recent fevers or chills. He denies
any palpitations, syncope, orthopnea or PND. He states his lower
extremity swelling is worse, and that he may have had some
weight gain since discharge from rehab. He admits to chronic
greenish sputum that has not changed in amount, consistency.
Denies hemetemesis. Denies chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea
or constipation, dysuria. He has chronic psoriasis and sebbhoric
dermatitis. He has some mild venous stasis changes in his LLE
which he states is chronic after an infection in his leg in
[**2-/2119**] and has not spread, but he states that recently it has
been slightly more red and painful. He vehemently denies that
'there is anything wrong with my heart'. He is chronically
hoarse from previous intubation attempts.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M with COPD on 4 L home O2, CHF, PE on coumadin who
presents with worsening shortness of breath.

# Shortness of breath: Likely multifactorial from recurrent COPD
exacerbation, volume overload from worsening CHF, possibly
worsening pulmonary hypertension. Patient with severe COPD, but
current [**Month/Day/Year 20358**] saturations are not far from his baseline of mid
80s on 4 L NC. ABG consistent with a possible acute on chronic
respiratory acidosis with some metabolic compensation. Patient
with increased weight gain and worsening [**Location (un) **] while at rehab. CXR
with ?LLL infiltrate, but patient has had multiple PNAs in the
past, without fever or increased sputum production, so CXR
finding could be resolving previous PNA. Suspicion for ACS/MI
low given no evidence of EKG changes and no chest pain. Patient
may also have worsening pulmonary hypertension from his severe
COPD contributing to his DOE. Pulmonary embolism was thought to
be unlikely given chronic therapeutic anticoagulation with
coumadin. The patient did complain of increased LLE pain and
swellling, likely from pre-existing venous insufficiency and
LENI was negative.

Overnight, the patient was maintained on face tent [**Location (un) 20358**], and
clinically improved.  Saturations trended in the low 90's with
transient dips into the high 70s and 80s, primarily with
exhertion, talking and eating.  In the morning the patient
received a second dose of azithromycin and prednisone was weaned
down to 60 mg po.  He felt back to baseline from a respiratory
status at the time of transfer.
.
# COPD: Severe (FEV1/FVC 43%) on 4 L home O2. Home [**Location (un) 20358**] sats
are in mid 80% range. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Continued inhalers
and spirava as above and prednisone with plan to rapidly tape to
baseline of 20 mg daily.
.
# CHF: EF > 55% in [**2119**]. Patient reports worsening SOB, [**Location (un) **], and
with weight gain (dry weight appears to be ~210, currently 220
lbs on admission).  The patient was diuresed overnight with net
negative about 1L.  TTE was obtained which showed EF >55% and
moderate pulm arterial hypertension.  Of note the echo did show
a prominent anterior fat pad versus a loculated pericardial
effusion anteriorly.  This does not correlate clinically and on
lateral CXR there was a very prominent retrosternal space that
this finding may represent.  This may be followed up as an
outpatient.
.
# LLE erythema: Pt with cellulitis in this leg in [**2-21**] and with
chronic venous stasis changes. Reports slightly increased
er
