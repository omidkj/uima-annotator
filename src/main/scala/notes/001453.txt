[**2128-11-20**]: KUB showed nonspecific bowel gas pattern.  Few small
air fluid levels. No free air under the diaphragm.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2128-11-20**], the patient was admitted to the general surgery
service.  She was continued on a regular diet with loperamide
while ostomy output was monitored.  CT abdomen with contrast
showed markedly-dilated proximal small bowel loops and more
distal collapsed small bowel loops.  Contrast was seen entering
the ileostomy.  These findings were concerning for partial small
bowel obstruction.  Stool cultures were repeatedly negative for
salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7, yersinia,
vibrio, and C. difficile toxin.  Fluid losses from the high
ostomy output were replaced mL for mL with LR IV.  Loperamide
was stopped as it showed limited benefit.  GI was consulted and
agreed with partial small bowel obstruction, with infectious
colitis and enteroenteric fistula on the differential as well.
Ostomy output varied from 1 to 2 L per day, and KUB on
[**2128-11-24**] showed single dilated air-filled small bowel loop in
the left lower quadrant consistent with partial small bowel
obstruction, with unchanged bowel gas pattern.  TPN was started
for nutrition.  With overall symptomatic improvement by
[**2128-11-28**], the patient was discharged home in stable condition,
NPO with TPN and IVF replacement, to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**]
in 1 week.
