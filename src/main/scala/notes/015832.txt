Chest pain

Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
 75 year old man with mild dementia, CAD, s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD,
SVG to OM1/OM2, SVG to PDA),  and prior stent to OM2 graft, PVD,
s/p fem [**Doctor Last Name **] in [**2174**], HTN, Aortic stenosis, CRI (cr 1.9), DM
admitted on [**2186-3-4**] to [**Hospital3 **] with chest pain that was
not relieved with nitro. Per patient, he has chest pain although
not reliably with exertion that is usually relieved with one
nitro. On Friday night he had his usual chest pain but it was
not relieved with nitro. This pain was associated with SOB. It
did not radiate but felt like pressure.
 He called the EMTs who told him to take an aspirin and brought
him to [**Hospital3 **]. He was given lasix, labetolol, and nitro
sl for SBP>200. BP came down to 150. The first troponin was
indeterminate (0.16) in the setting of CRI. EKG showed NSR with
rate 75bpm, 1st degree AVB with IVCD and 1mm ST depression in
lateral aspect with no change from prior EKGs. On admission he
also had SOB and CXR that was reportedly consistenet with CHF as
well as mildly elevated BNP (627). He was given 40mg IV lasix
and was admitted for ROMI and CHF exacerbation.
 The next day the patient underwent a nuclear stress test that
showed diffuse ST depressions II, III, aVF, V4-V6. His troponins
then rose with peak troponin of 4.77 and CKMB 16.8. Patient was
started on heparin. He was not treated with plavix because of
concern for three vessel disease and potential cardiac surgery.
Trops then dropped back down to 2.99. The patient never reported
CP while hospitalized.
 Last cath ([**2181**] at [**Hospital1 2177**]) showed patent grafts and 60% stenosis
in SVG to OM2 which was not intervened upon. In [**2180**] patient had
cath at [**Hospital1 18**] and had stent placed in SVG to OM2 graft.
 He was evaluated with MR of the spine at the OSH for h/o severe
spinal stenosis and right-sided radiculopathy. There was
consideration for epidural injection, however, because of the
cardiac issues this was deferred.
 It was decided to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath
and potential intervention on the OM2 lesion.
 VS prior to transfer:  144/68, 59 SB, 20, 97.6, 95% on room
air.
 Patient was transferred directly to the cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**].
There he underwent cardiac cath with attempted intervention on
OM2 lesion at end of previously placed stent, however, they were
unable to pass the wire and no intervention was done. The
patient's procedure was complicated by a groin hematoma.
Pressure was held for 1.5 hours. Patient remained
hemodynamically stable throughout.


Past Medical History:
Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes(+), Dyslipidemia(+),
Hypertension(+)

Cardiac History: CABG, in [**2175-2-2**] anatomy as follows:
LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG-OM2, SVG-rPDA

Percutaneous coronary intervention ([**2180**]):
1.  Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant
system with severe three vessel disease.  The left main was
without stenoses. The LAD had a 100% mid vessel occlusion with
diffuse disease.  The left circumflex had 100% proximal
occlusion.  The RCA was 100% occluded in the mid-vessel.
2.  Selective graft angiography demonstrated a patent SVG-OM1
and
SVG-rPDA.  The SVG to OM2 had a 90% stenosis at the distal
anastamosis. The LIMA-LAD could not be selectively engaged
because of subclavian tortuosity.  Nonselective injections
demonstrated a patent graft.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
4.  Stenting of the OM2 was performed via the SVG with a 2.5 x
13 mm
Cypher.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG-OM1, SVG-rPDA, and LIMA-LAD.
3. SVG-OM2 with 90% stenosis in the distal anastamosis.
4. Stenting of the OM2. (reportedly), in [**2181**] anatomy as
follows: patent grafts, 60% distal stenosis in the SVG to Om2-
medical, mangement continued.

PCI [**2181**] at [**Hospital1 2177**]:
LAD 100% occluded proximally
LCX 100% occluded proximally
RCA 100% occluded mid
LMCA 70% diffuse stenosis
Grafts:
 - LIMA to LAD patent
 - SVG to OM1: patent with diffuse disease
 - SVG to OM2: Patent with 60% distal stenosis
 - SVG to PDA: Patent

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed severe left main plus three vessel native coronary
artery
disease. The LMCA had a 90% stenosis. The LAD and LCX were
occluded
proximally, and the RCA occluded distally.
2.  Selective venous conduit angiography revealed a patent
saphenous
vein grafts to OM1, OM2 and PDA. The SVG-OM1 had a occlusion in
the
native OM1 distal to a previously placed stent. The SVG-OM2 had
a 50%
stenosis in the proximal portion of the graft.
3.  Nonselective angiography of the LIMA demonstrated a tubular
50-60%
stenosis in the mid LAD.
4. Unsuccessful PTCA attempt of the totally occluded OM vessel
(See
PTCA comments).
5.  Failed attempt to close the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a
Perclose closure device - manual compression applied.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease with patent LIMA
and SVG
grafts.
2. Unsuccessful PTCA attempt of the occluded OM branch.
3. Unsuccessful closure attempt of the right femoral arteriotomy
site
with a Perclose closure device.
