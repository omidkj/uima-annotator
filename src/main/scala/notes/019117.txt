Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2146-6-27**] Mitral valve repair with a posterior leaflet (P3)
triangular resection and anterior leaflet cleft closure and ring
annuloplasty using a 34-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Physio II ring.
Left-sided Maze procedure with AtriCure Bipolar Synergy RF
system with resection of left atrial appendage.

History of Present Illness:
The patient was in her usual state of health until [**6-19**], when
she experienced a rapid heart beating at ~8.15am. She has had
sporadic rapid heart rates and mitral regurgitation since [**2121**],
but her typical episodes usually only last 10-15 minutes. She
often stops the rapid beating by lying still on the floor. This
time, her heart rate stayed elevated at ~200 bpm for 45 minutes
despite lying on the floor, and the Pt called 911. Pt keeps a
regular log and her HR at home is otherwise almost always 70-75.
During the entire episode, Pt did not experience chest pain,
shortness of breath, or light-headedness. Per the Pt, she has
had episodes of rapid heart rate ~ 1x yearly in the late [**2114**],
increasing to a few times yearly in the [**2124**], and notably more
in [**2137**] when her husband died, after which she would experience
a rapid HR ~1x monthly. Since [**2145-9-20**], she experiences
rapid HR episodes ~1x weekly. She is generally asymptomic, but
sometimes feels very faint and weak.

EMS did ECG and found her to be in A-fib w/ rapid ventricular
response w/ rate ~200s. She was given IV diltiazem (unknown
amount) and transferred to [**Hospital6 **] in [**Location (un) 1110**],
MA. During her hospitalization, she was treated with diltiazem
extended release 120mg po daily and metoprolol 12.5mg po tid.
Her BP was 90s and her resting HR was 90s-100s, but would jump
up to 170s-180s for several minutes. OSH also began
anticoagulation w/ enoxaparin and warfarin on [**6-21**]. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for higher level of care on [**2146-6-22**].

-Bleeding peptic ulcer [**2137**] s/p EGD and H pylori rx
-Mitral Valve Prolapse with mitral regurgitation
-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation w/ rapid ventricular response
-Cataract surgery, OSH [**2140**]

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. There is moderate/severe anterior and posterior
leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is partial P3 mitral
leaflet flail. Torn mitral chordae are present. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Tricuspid valve prolapse is present. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results at
time of surgery prior to incision.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is status post mitral valve repair.
There is a mitral annuloplasty ring in position. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. No mitral stenosis is seen. Left
ventricular function is depressed compared to pre-bypass exam
(LVEF 40-45%). There is mild hypokinesis of the inferior and
inferoseptal walls at the mid-papillary level. Right ventricular
function is unchanged. There is trace aortic regurgitation.
Moderate (2+) tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged from
pre-bypass exam. The ascending aorta, aortic arch, and
descending aorta are intact.

HISTORY: Status post MVR, evaluate effusions.

CHEST, TWO VIEWS.

The patient is status post sternotomy, with cardiomegaly. The
MVR is
unchanged. There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent
with left
lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. Allowing for technical
differences,
this is similar to [**2146-6-28**]. There is right cardiophrenic
density, which
appears worse compared with the earlier film. There is minimal
blunting of
the right costophrenic angle which is probably new. The lateral
film suggests
small bilateral effusions. The upper zones are clear without
evidence of CHF
or focal consolidation.

IMPRESSION: Compared with [**2146-6-28**], left base consolidation is
unchanged.
Right cardiophrenic density and right lateral CPA effusion are
new.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted for rapid atrial fibrillation but was
asymptomactic.  She underwent further evaluation which included
echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization. Echocardiogram
showed severe mitral regurgitation with bileaflet mitral valve
prolapse and partial P3 flail. Coronary angiography revealed
normal coronary arteries. Preoperative course was otherwise
uneventful and she was cleared for surgery. On [**6-27**], Mrs.
[**Known lastname 90693**] was taken to the operating room for mitral valve repair
and Maze procedure with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. For surgical details,
please see operative note. Following surgery, she was admitted
to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. She was initially noted to
have a normal sinus rhythm. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. She
developed atrial fibrillation and was treated with amiodarone
and lopressor and converted back to sinus rhythm, then
junctional rhythm.  Due to junctional rhythm then heart block
the amiodarone and lopressor were stopped and electrophysiology
was consulted.  The ECG demonstrated high grade heart block and
accelerated junctional rhythm at the time. Over several days,
heart rate improved and low dose beta blockade was r
