Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo male with history of metastatic prostate cancer, ITP on
chronic steroids, and hypercholesterolemia was admitted from the
ED with fever and weakness. History was obtained from the chart,
patient, and family.

He presented with 2-3 days of the following symptoms: fever on
the day of admission to 101, cough productive of green sputum,
shaking chills, disorientation, fatigue, poor PO intake, and
marked weakness. He is typically independent of all ADLs and was
noted by his family to be so weak that he could not even stand
up. Of note, he underwent kyphoplasty on [**2117-1-29**] for treatment
of his bony metastases. Per report from his family, his back
pain has completely improved with kyphoplasty.

Upon arrival in the ED, temp 96.7, HR 132, BP 84/56, RR 24, and
pulse ox 98% on room air. Repeat temperature rectally was
elevated to 101.8. Exam was notable for rhonchi throughout and
generalized weakness. Labs are notable for creatinine 2.2, WBC
11.2, Hct 35.4, and lactate 2.7. UA was suggestive of UTI, with
indwelling foley. CXR was notable for a retrocardiac opacity.
ECG demonstrates old RBBB with new TWI in V1-2. He received 3-4L
IVF, cefepime, levofloxacin, decadron 10mg IV x 1 (for concern
of hypotension in the setting of chronic steroids), and tylenol.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2117-2-14**]):
Culture workup discontinued. Further incubation showed
contamination
with mixed skin/genital flora. Clinical significance of
isolate(s)
uncertain. Interpret with caution. PROBABLE ENTEROCOCCUS.
10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.

Urine Legionella Ag: Negative

Blood Cx [**2117-2-9**], [**2117-2-12**], [**2117-2-13**], [**2117-2-14**] all negative.

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2117-2-22**],
[**2117-2-24**]):
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.

STUDIES:
[**2117-2-9**] Portable CXR -
1. Ill-defined retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis but
infection cannot be excluded.
2. Unchanged metastatic involvement of the right posterior fifth
rib.

[**2117-2-9**] ECG - NSR at ~125 bpm, normal axis, RBBB, unchanged from
prior.

ECHO [**2117-2-16**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. A
patent foramen ovale is present with prominent right-to-left
passage of microbubbles at rest and with cough. . Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Patent foramen ovale with right-to-left passage of
microbubbles at rest and with cough. Normal biventricular cavity
sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Dilated ascendin
