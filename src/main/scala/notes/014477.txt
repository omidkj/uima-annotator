stone stone in the major papilla. Sphincterotomy performed.

without free air. NGT placed. Bolused 250 cc in the setting of
elevated lactate and Cr. BP stable. MAP 75-90. Trop 0.14,
lactate trending down (peak 5.1). PR ASA. Insulin gtt. Glucose
trending down. Hyper K resolved. Bolused again with albuminx2
overnight. UOP sluggish. Down to 5cc/hr. Urine lytes sent. FeNa
0.7%
5/8: Cardiology consulted- possible non-ischemic CM and inferior
septal ischemia, recommended start milrinone, repeat TTE in AM;
Renal consulted- starting CVVH;family meeting- continue
aggressive care for now; placed R IJ HD catheter and R
subclavian CVL. Started neo, levo, milrinone. Changed neo to
vaso. Received 2.5L IVF during code event. Bolused 500cc NS x4
overnight for hypoTN and gave calcium chloride x1. Transfused 1u
PRBC's for hypoTN and hct 26, post-transfusion Hct 24.
Transfused additional 2u PRBC's. Abdominal distention and peak
pressures increases, so decided to paralyze.
[**4-5**] CODE: developed respiratory distress ~245pm, associated with
rhythm abnormalities (likely vtach) on telemetry; patient's AICD
fired, with return to NSR; elected to intubate [**12-30**] respiratory
distress; uncomplicated intubation, though hypotensive with
induction, requiring neo; back in vtach/vfib without pulses,
started ACLS; multiple firings of patient's AICD and 2 shocks
from defibrilator, 2 rounds epi, 300 amiodarone, ROSC at 16
minutes
[**4-6**]: Peak pressures improved with paralysis, but MAP dropped to
58-62. Gave calcium chloride and hydrocort 100 x1. Family
discussion re:goals of care/prognosis. Echo-no interval change.
Bedside laparotomy for decompression. Milrinone d/c'd. Weaning
NE.
[**4-7**]: Weaning vasopressin. Titrating levophed. Bedside
laparotomy, washout. Secondary compartment syndrome. No necrotic
bowel but did have white "studs" throguhout (? saponification).
Abdominal wound to wall suction. CVVH running even. Cis on for
procedure and then off.
[**4-8**]: Off paralysis. Weaned levo to 0.1 and turned off vaso. Ran
even on CVVH during day, then 50/hr negative. Decreased MAP goal
to >55. Cultured for temp 101.5.
[**4-9**]: D/c Foley. Sputum cx sent. D/c midaz gtt, start prn
boluses. HD line cultured. Transfused 1u pRBC (26.3->29.8). WBC
up to 22K. Family meeting held to discuss prognosis-interpreter,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26687**], eldest son and majority of family present. NGT
replaced by OGT because of deep tissue injury at nare.
[**4-10**]: Transfused 2 unit pRBC without appropriate bump. WBC
trending up, bandemia. Vasopressor weaned off. plan for OR [**4-11**]
for washout. Family meeting held (update). Abdominal dressing
oozing. WBC up to ~40. Levo down to 0.08. Transfused 1 unit pRBC
for Hgb 9 in the setting of increasing wound output.
[**4-11**]: Intermittently on/off levo. CT torso with extensive
inflammation; no abscess/collection. CT head unremarkable. OR
for wash-out. Transfused 1u PRBC's post-op for Hct 24.4-> 27.7.

day without incr in levophed requirement (0.08)
[**4-14**]: OR for washout; unable to do cholecystectomy or J-tube [**12-30**]
hemodynamic instability. Back from OR on levo/neo.
[**4-15**]: TBili 9.1 (DBili 6.8) post-op, up from 7.0 pre-op.
Phenylephrine d/c'd. Propofol weaned. CVVH run negative
initially but --> even per primary team. Hepatology consulted
and recommended RUQ ultrasound-not performed due to lack of
view. Spiked, cultured.
[**4-16**]: CVVH running even to try and avoid intra-op HD issues. No
further episodes of VT. OR planned for [**Doctor First Name **]. for washout, ? ccy,
? mesh. Bolused for hypotension in early AM.
[**4-17**]: Ran even/positive on CVVH to avoid increasing pressors.
Taken for wash-out, unable to do ccy, J-tube, or closure due to
hemodynamic instability. Returned from OR on increased levo and
back on neo. Changed vanco to 750".
[**4-18**]: Abx d/c'd (discussed w/ACS). Will hold TFs at midnight for
possible trach tomorrow. Transfused 1u pRBCs for Hct 23.7.
Pan-cultured. Dextrose gtt d/c'd. Attempting to run even.
[**4-19**]: Trach done at bedside. No J-tube placement per ACS. went
into vtach >5x, aicd broke rhythm. cards rec amio 150 bolus and
1mg/hr gtt x6 hours then 0.5mg/hr for 24 hours and repeat echo
tomorrow
[**4-20**]: Family meeting with interpreter. Transfused 2u PRBC's for
Hct 24 and continued pressor requirement. Tolerated -50cc/hr
CVVH for -1L for the day. Echo relatively unchanged from
previous. Amio gtt completed, started po.
[**4-21**]: Trach collar yesterday. Issues with CVVH this AM; renal
will see. Will go to IR today for tunneled dialysis catheter
placement. ISS started; will attempt to wean off insulin drip.
Minimal residuals; will consider d/c'ing NGT if remain low.
[**4-22**]: HD line d/c'd, tunneled line placed. Back to OR for
washout.
[**4-23**]: Episode of Vtach with hypotension, on max dose of levo,
started vaso and epi.
[**4-24**]: Unable to wean pressors, worsening hypotension. Patient
expired at 11.45 pm, family present at bedside.
