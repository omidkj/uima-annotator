History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old spanish speaking F with a history
of OSA, Asthma/COPD, CAD, CHF (unkown EF), HTN, DM on insulin,
and CKD (Cr 1.6-2.0, recently 3.0) who 'fell out of bed' and
found at [**Last Name (un) 2299**] house with an open left tib/fib fracture.
.
In the ER multiple films were done which showed negative ct
head/c-spine/torso. Xrays showed open tib-fib comminuted
fracture, calcaneal fracture. She had a suspected right sided
fracture as well. Seen by [**Last Name (un) **] in the ED and planned for
surgery this morning. Labs in ED were notable for elevated K
(6.7) and acute on chronic renal failure (Cr 3.2). She received
kayexalate x1, 10U insulin, 1amp D50. For pain she was given 2mg
dilaudid. She also received 1gram Ancef. Vital signs were T99,
HR 71, BP 142/88, RR 16, 91% RA, 99% 2L. She was taken directly
from ED to OR pre-op area.
.
She was admitted and evaluated by the [**Doctor Last Name **] Firm in the Pre-Op
Area where a repeat K was 7.0 and not following commands. She
was given another round of insulin and D50, one amp of bicarb,
and 1000mg calcium gluconate in the operating room. The case was
discussed with the orthopedic team and anesthesia. Given that
the washout and ex-fix for an open fracture was necessary within
8 hours after injury, she was taken to the OR. She remained
hemodynamically stable with 100cc EBL. She remained intubated in
the PACU given her mental status prior to surgery, and her thick
secretions. Her c-spine films were normal, but clearance was
deferred as the patient's mental status was altered.
.
She was transferred to the MICU due to difficulties extubating.
It was felt to be due to increased secretions. Her VS were
T96.0, BP 160/40, RR 15 and HR 63, 100% on AC. An ABG was
7.29/52/110 on AC 500x14, FiO2 50%, PEEP of 5, at time of
evaluation in the PACU. A CXR did not show any new changes
compared to pre-OP CXR. An EKG did not show any peaked T waves
or new changes. Sputum cultures were sent.

Studies:
[**2154-1-5**] Knee Xray:
AP AND LATERAL LEFT KNEE: Overlying casting material obscures
bony detail. Fracture is identified involving the proximal
fibula. No joint effusion is detected.
IMPRESSION: Non-displaced fracture of the proximal fibula.
[**2154-1-5**] CT Chest:
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The lungs show
mild dependent atelectasis. No pneumothorax, pleural or
pericardial effusion is identified. The heart is enlarged and
demonstrates coronary artery calcification. The thoracic aorta
maintains a normal contour. Note is made of enlargement of left
lobe of the thyroid, which may represent a goiter, however,
confirmation with physical exam and thyroid function tests is
recommended.
----------------
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The liver,
spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are within normal limits.
The kidneys are atrophic. No intra-abdominal free air, free
fluid, or lymphadenopathy is identified. Intra-abdominal loops
of large and small bowel maintain normal caliber without
evidence of obstruction. The abdominal aorta demonstrates
calcified atherosclerotic plaques, however, maintains a normal
caliber throughout.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum,
sigmoid colon, bladder, uterus, and intrapelvic loops of small
bowel are within normal limits. No free fluid or
lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesion is
identified. Note is made of diffuse osteopenia.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intra-abdominal parenchymal organ
injury.
[**2154-1-5**] Tib/Fib:
AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE TIBIA AND FIBULA: Overlying splint
obscures fine detail. There is a comminuted fracture of the
distal tibia and fibula. The distal fracture fragment is
externaly rotated. Additional fractures are identified involving
the plantar surface of the calcaneus as well as the proximal
fibula.
[**2154-1-5**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Apparent widening of the mediastinum,
which may be related to technical factors, however, CT or repeat
chest radiograph with PA and lateral technique should be
employed for further evaluation.
[**2154-1-5**] CXR: Comparison is made to prior radiographs from
[**2154-1-5**]. There is an endotracheal tube with distal tip
is at the level of the clavicles, 4.5 cm above the carina.  The
feeding tube is appropriately sited. There is persistent
cardiomegaly and mediastinal prominence which is unchanged since
the previous study.  There is no focal consolidation or signs of
overt pulmonary edema.  There is widening of the left AC joint
suggestive of prior surgery or trauma.
[**2154-1-5**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Exam is somewhat limited by motion, however, no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage.
2. A 3-mm rounded sclerotic focus is seen within the left
mandibular condyle, which may represent a bone island, however,
correlation with history of malignancy is recommended.
[**1-15**]
RIGHT ANKLE: There is a large medial fracture plate in the
distal tibia fixating a fracture through the distal tibia. There
is also a compound complex fracture of the distal fibula. The
alignment is grossly anatomic. The tibiotalar joint is slightly
widened medially. There is generalized osteopenia. There is soft
tissue swelling.

LEFT ANKLE: External fixation hardware is seen within the tibial
shaft and in the calcaneus. There is a complex fracture
involving the tibial metaphysis with multiple fracture fragments
within the central portion of the bone. There is also a complex
fracture of the distal fibular shaft at the same level. The
ankle mortise is preserved.
TTE [**1-7**]

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and, basal
and distal inferior wall, and mid anterior wall. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic press
