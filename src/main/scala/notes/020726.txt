History of Present Illness:
56 y.o. man with HIV presented with abd pain and hematemesis at
dialysis.  Pt had sudden onset of nausea and vomitting with
blood streaks in emesis.  Sent to the ED for further eval and
found to be hypotensive to SBP in 80's and febrile to 102.6.
Blood cultures were drawn and pt started on vanco, levo, flagyl.
 Pt also received fluids 2l NS and code sepsis was called.  A
right IJ presep cath was placed.  Pt was also started on
peripheral dopamine for his hypotension.

CT Abd Contrast ([**2152-8-18**])
1. Unchanged appearance of a markedly dilated common bile duct
and mild central intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. No
evidence of an obstructing lesion. Correlation with liver
function tests is suggested.
.
2. Slight interval enlargement of retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
.
CT Head ([**2152-9-3**])
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

2. Chronic small vessel ischemic change and lacunar infarct in
the right thalamus.
.
ECHO ([**2152-8-22**])
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.  Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2152-6-6**], the
aortic valve gradient is slightly higher, but the calculated
aortic valve area is similar.
.
ekg [**8-31**]

Normal sinus rhythm. Downsloping ST segment depressions in leads
I, aVL and leads V4-V6 suggest to possibility of anterolateral
ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2152-8-23**] there has
been no diagnostic interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to MICU, pt had lipase of [**Numeric Identifier 961**] c/w pancreatitis.
Abd CT showed chronically dilated CBD but no evidence of
pancreatitis.  It was thought pt may also have cholangitis given
fever, and no other explanation for pancreatitis.  ERCP was done
and showed pus in biliary system, s/p sphinceteromy.  Bld CX
grew out E. coli for which pt was on levaquin for and GPCs for
which vanco was added.
.
12 hours after admission to MICU, pt had acute hypoxic resp
failure requiring intubation.  He had a brief asystolic arrest
which responded to ventilation for hypoxia and atropine/epi.
Etiology of resp fialure was thought to be ARDS vs. CHF.
.
Pt remained intubated c several unsuccessful attempts at weaning
limited by desaturation when placed on PS trials of 7/0.
Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole were started and levaquin
stopped for broader coverage.  Pt. remained afebrile on this
regimen.  Tube feeds were attempted given seemingly functional
gut (BS, stool) but were limited by persistently high residuals.
 Pt. started on PPN and scheduled for post-pyloric doboff tube
placement.
.
Pt. had febrile episode on [**8-25**] - lines were changed, abd CT done
to eval. pancreas - no evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis.
Pt. pan cultured but no growth.  Pt. noted to have R sided
pleural effusion but was determined to be too small for
thoracocentesis.  Pt. fever resolved.  Abx continued for 14 day
course but metronidazole stopped at day 9.
.
Pt. continued to fail SBT; limited by hypoxia.  Discussions re:
trach were started with partner.  Pt. also could not receive
tube feeds given difficulty advancing Dobhoff tube into
post-pyloric position (s/p two attempts under flouro).  TPN was
administered.  Plan was to place PEG if tube did not advance on
its own.  Pt. noted to be significantly volume overloaded [**8-30**].
Plan was to try removing volume with ultrafiltration during
dialysis to optimize pulmonary V/Q status + minimize shunting
prior to SBT.  Failing this, pt. to receive trach.  This was
discussed with pt's partner who agreed.  PEG also discussed with
partner who agreed.  Pt. failed SBT immediately after dialysis;
limited by desaturation and dyspnea.  P
