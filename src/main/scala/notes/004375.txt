Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated on mechanical ventilation.
s/p colectomy with hartmann's pouch at [**Hospital3 **] [**2176-5-27**]

History of Present Illness:
70 y/o female transferred from [**Hospital3 4107**] on mechanical
ventilation for respiratory failure.  Patient presented to
[**Hospital1 **] on [**2176-5-22**] with abdominal pain and underwent a sigmoid
colectomy with hartmann's pouch on [**5-27**]/o4 for microperforated
diverticulitis.  On [**2176-5-29**], the patient suffered a NSTEMI and
developed respiratory failure secondary to multilobar pneumonia
and CHF overlying her severe COPD.  In addition to hyercarbic
and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation, the
patient had fevers unresponsive to gentamycin, flagyl,
vancomycin, aztreonam and linezolid.  One blood culture of 4 was
postive for MRSA from [**2176-5-29**] at [**Hospital3 4107**].  Subsequent
blood, urine, and sputum cultures at [**Hospital3 4107**] were
negative.

[**2176-6-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
CHEST AP: The tip of the right IJ line is in the mid SVC. The
endotracheal tip about 5 cm above the carina. The distal end of
the feeding tube is not visualized and is below the diaphragm.
There is mild cardiomegaly. There are bilateral alveolar
opacities, right greater than left. Some prominent interstitial
markings are also seen in both mid and lower zones. There are no
pleural effusions. The right costophrenic angle has been cut off
from this study. There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Right IJ line in appropriate position without
evidence of pneumothorax. Pneumonia in the right middle and
lower zones with some pulmonary edema.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**2176-6-11**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
HISTORY: 70 y/o with history of ---no sochromal-- pneumonia.
Status post colectomy.
This study is compared to previous study of 1 day earlier and
since the previous study there has been reexpansion of
previously seen atelectatic left lower lobe. There has been
worsening in the degree of consolidation involving the right
middle lobe and right lower lobe since the previous study. A
small associated right pleural effusion is suspected. The left
lung and the right upper lobe are clear. There is continued
application of the right subclavian CVP line, ET tube and NG
tube.
IMPRESSION:
Interval expansion of the left lower lobe.Worsening infiltration
of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe suggestive of
pneumonia.

[**2176-6-8**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US
INDICATION: Elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and
transaminitis. Intubated on tube feeds.
TECHNIQUE: Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed.
FINDINGS: The gallbladder is nondistended, with a thin wall. No
stones or sludge is seen within the gallbladder. There is no
intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The common bile
duct measures 4 mm in size. No hepatic lesions are seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of cholecystitis.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1) Diffuse severe emphysema.
2) Diffuse superimposed ground-glass and interstitial opacities.
This likely related to superimposed pulmonary edema secondary to
cardiac failure.
3) Several nodular opacities, most prominent at the lung bases.
Confirmation of resolution of these nodular opacities after
treatment is recommended to rule-out possible metastatic
disease. Conversely, these nodular opacities along with patchy
opacities seen in the lower lobes may relate to superimposed
aspiration and/or pneumonia.
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1) Small amount of fluid adjacent to the left colon stump,
likely post operative in nature. There is no collection
suspicious for a mature abscess at this time.
2) Small low attenuation lesions in the liver and spleen. These
are likely benign but are not fully characterized on this study.
3) Calcified irregular aorta and prominent infrarenal
plaque/thrombus.
4) Findings discussed with the Surgical Service.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2176-6-5**], the patient was electively transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
where pneumonia and CHF were confirmed by CXR and CT scan. She
was continued on vancomycin for a total of thirteen days while
the other antibiotics were discontinued since her course had
been completed or they were not providing useful coverage for
nosocomial pneumonia.
Subsequently, the patient tolerated pressure support ventilation
with acceptable oxygen saturation considering her severe COPD
with home oxygen requirement. However, she was never
successfully able to pass spontaneous breathing trials with
ability to remain alert to support her airway. Her mental status
at best was arousable to voice and very seldomly able to blink
her eyes upon command. She became very hypertensive and anxious
or in pain when weaned off sedation with fentanyl and/or
midazolam. Throughout her hospital course, the patient was
gently diuresed with lasix for CHF exacerbation and
hypertension. Additionally, she received metoprolol, captopril,
ASA, atorvastatin, and combivent nebulizer th
