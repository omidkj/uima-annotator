Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
attempted subclavian triple lumen catheter

History of Present Illness:
83yo woman with medical history significant for HTN, IDDM,
CAD s/p MI and peripheral vascular disease with recent bilateral
toe amputations presented from nursing home with complaints
of dyspnea. She was noted there to have oxygen saturation of
58-66% on room air. She was given albuterol.
.
Initial vitals in [**Hospital1 18**] ED were 99.8, 67, 68/22, 14, and 100% on
2Lnc.
Initial potassium was 6.4, and she was given calcium gluconate,
insulin/d50, one amp of bicarbonate, and keyexalate 30cc po
once. She was also given decadron 6mg once IV given hypotension
and recent history of steroid taper at nursing home.  Also given
ASA 81mg po x 4.  Given vanco 1g/levaquin 500mg/flagyl 500mg.
BP increased to 100's systolic after 1.5L in NS bolus. Bedside
TTE was done, and demonstrated global hypokinesis with an EF of
20-25%. Trop was elevated at 1.45 with flat CK. Also noted
transaminitis.
.
On limited review of systems here in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she does endorse
dyspnea, but does not elaborate on this. Denies any chest pain.
Denies any recent fevers/chills or other infectious symptoms.
Her daughters
are present for interview, and they report that she has had
progressive dementia with recent placement in a nursing home.

Physical Exam:
vitals: (in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]) 97.2, 69, 138/73, 16, 100% on 50% cool neb
mask

.

gen: alert; minimally oriented. No acute distress. No
respiratory distress.
heent: sclera anicteric
neck: no JVD appreciated; full neck habitus
cv: regular rate, rhythm. No m/r/g
resp: bibasilar decreased breath sounds with inspiratory
crackles
abd: obese, NABS, soft, NT
extr: 1+ symmetric edema bilaterally; bilateral toe amputations;
extremities are warm with no mottling.
neuro: no focal deficits.

Pertinent Results:
Admit data/imaging:

AP SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: The cardiac silhouette is
grossly enlarged with left ventricular and right atrial
prominence. The aorta  contains intramural calcifications. There
is mild pulmonary vascular redistribution with layering peural
effusions bilaterally. The surrounding soft tissue and osseous
structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: CHF. Cardiomegaly. An underlying pneumonia cannot be
excluded.

.

Admission EKG:

Sinus rhythm at 67bpm with normal axis, intervals. Notable for
1mm ST depression in I and aVL; also with TWI in V1, V2; also
minimal 1mm upsloping ST elevation in III and aVF.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan:

83yo woman with h/o IDDM, HTN, CAD s/p MI admitted with
complaints of dyspnea and hypotension.

.

1. Hypotension

- Differential includes cardiogenic (with ischemia history and
evidence of global hypokinesis), hypovolemic, neurogenic, septic
(supported by evidence of UTI, elevated WBC count with
neutrophilic predominance, tachypnea, elevated lactate), and
adrenal insufficiency (given recent steroid taper).
- Overall, clinical exam not consistent with cardiogenic shock;
no JVD appreciated, and extremities are warm and well perfused.
- Suspect rather distributive shock with contributions from
likely
urosepsis and consideration of adrenal insufficiency.
.
- will place central venous access
- bolus for CVP goal [**8-25**]
- pressors as needed for MAP > 65
- will continue broad spectrum antibiotics - most likely
source is urinary tract; consider toe amputation site/wound
infection as potential source.
- follow pan-cultures and tailor accordingly
- check [**Last Name (un) 104**]-stim, then start stress dose steroids

.

2. Dyspnea

- Given h/o likely ischemic cardiomyopathy and bedside echo
showing very significant global hypokinesis with EF of 20% and
CXR findings
consistent with pulmonary edema, most likely etiology of initial
dyspnea and ongoing hypoxia is congestive heart failure.
- question whether elevated troponin may represent recent
ischmic
event or events that may explain her worsening congestive heart
failure.
- unclear as to whether she has been following sodium
restriction
and being adherent to her medication regimen.

.

3. Troponin elevation

- With no active ischemic symptoms, non-diagnostic EKG
changes (no baseline ekg for comparison), and flat CK,
suggests that this is not an Acute coronary syndrome.
- [**Month (only) 116**] rather represent troponin leak in setting of hypotension
or residual troponin elevation after distant event with
renal insufficiency.
- Cardiology has been involved; not planning on any intervention
for present time.
- will cycle cardiac enzymes

.

4. Renal failure - uncertain chronicity/acuity

- check urine lytes, calculate FeNa
- get renal US to evaluate for obstruction/hydronephrosis
- r/o active urine sediment
- try to obtain baseline labs

.

5. Hyperkalemia

- likely secondary to renal insufficiency in combination
with ace-inhibitor
- no acute EKG changes from hyperkalemia
- s/p acute intervention with calcium, insulin/d50, bicarbonate,
and kayexalate
- persistent hyperkalemia; will continue kayexalate and
monitor for any further EKG changes
- hold ace-i

.

6. Transaminitis/shock liver

- progressive increase in transaminitis; with levels > 1000,
likely secondary to hypoperfusion/shock liver with hypotensive
episode.
- likely some component of congestive hepatopathy as well.
- will consider differential of extreme transaminitis and
check for toxic injury/tylenol and acute viral hepatitis.

.

7. Coagulopathy/? DIC

- elevated INR; does not take coumadin - per med list from
nursing home.
- consider Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy vs.
coagulopathy
from liver synthetic dysfunction
- low fibrinogen suggests DIC, but can be seen with hepatic
synthetic dysfunction as well.
- need to check hemolysis labs and peripheral smear for
signs of intravascular hemolysis.
- treat infectious process
- give FFP prior to central line

.

8. IDDM

- marked hyperglycemia with high-normal anion gap
- monitor FS and manage with sliding scale coverage;
will consider Insulin gtt.

.

9. Urinary tract infection/leukocytosis

- follow up urine cultures, blood cultures
- continue broad spectrum abx coverage

.

10. Increased anion gap metabolic acidosis

- likely contribution from lactic acidosis (lactate of 7.0
trending down to 4.0) as well as azotemia
- will check ABG to further characterize acid/base status

.

11. DNR/DNI - confirmed with daughter (who is health care
proxy).

.

12. Access:

- Only peripheral IV for now; will need central access for
transducing CVP, consideration of swan-ganz, and potential for
pressors.
- reverse coagulopathy with FFP for placement of central line.

.

13. dispo - ICU

- Several hours after admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (same day of admission
via Emergency
department), she became progressively bradycardic, hypotensive,
and hypoxemic
acutely. Central access was attempted, but she coded (pulseless
and unresponsive)
at this time. In total, she was given atropine 1mg x 2 for
bradycardia.
- No further intervention/resuscitation was done, as (discussed
in depth
with patient's two daughters/health care proxy on admission to
[**Name (NI) 153**]) she
was DNR/DNI.
- She passed away at 4pm on [**2134-10-25**]. Family was notified, death
paperwork
was done, and medical examiner was notified (as death occurred
within
24hrs of admission to hospital). Medical examiner heard case and
denied
any further investigation.
- Family denied any post-mortem examination.
