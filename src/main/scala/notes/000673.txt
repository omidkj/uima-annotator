Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracocentesis

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 54 year-old female with a history of pulmonary
embolism, chronic left-sided pleural effusion, and Non-small
cell lung CA on seliciclib chemotherapy who presents with
fevers. Patient is s/p several regimens of chemotherapy and XRT,
as well as rigid bronchoscopy and laser treatment for
obstructive bronchial lesion, currently on seliciclib received
3rd cycle on [**2184-7-29**].  She was recently discharged from the
hospital on [**2184-7-15**] with a newly diagnosed right-sided
pulmonary embolism, as well as a post-obstructive pneumonia, for
which she received azithromycin x 5 days and cefpodoxime x 14
days.  The patient's fevers have not improved on either regimen.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Cholecystectomy [**2169**].
2. Total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine fibroids [**2164**].
3. Partial thyroidectomy in [**2164**] for further evaluation of a

.
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: history of meningioma resected in [**2181**];
developed a chronic cough in the beginning of 11/[**2182**]. On
[**2183-11-16**] she developed hemoptysis which prompted her to
present to [**Hospital 76515**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 1474**]. A mass was seen in her left
upper
lobe on chest x-ray. She underwent bronchoscopy on [**2183-11-19**]
with pathology consistent with nonsmall cell lung cancer, most
likely adenocarcinoma. IH was positive for TTF-1 and CK7,
negative for CK20. A PET-CT on [**2183-11-29**], reportedly showed
uptake in the left lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, and left
adrenal gland. Head MRI was negative. She had a bronchoscopy on
[**2183-12-19**] at which time a stent was placed in the left mainstem
 bronchus. She underwent repeat bronchoscopy and endobronchial
ultrasound on [**2184-1-1**]. A level 7 and a level 4 node were
biopsied by FNA. The cytology from these was negative. She
started radiation therapy on [**2184-1-6**].

She lives with her partner. She smoked for 30
years x 1.5 packs per day, quit seven years ago. She denies
alcohol use.

history of cancers

STUDIES:
[**2184-8-2**] - CT TORSO
FINDINGS:
.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Hyponehancement of left
lingula and left lower lobe conistent with Pnuemonia is noted.
There is a large plueral effusion filling the whole of the left
hemithorax with complete collapse of the left lung. The large
necrotic tumor in the left lower lung has increased in size
since the last examination
.
Multiple bilateral new axillary lymph nodes are seen with the
biggest
measuring 13 x 4 in the right axillary region (series 3, image
15). A new
prevascular lymph node is seen abutting between the left
subclavian vein and left subclavian artery measuring 25 x 20 mm
(series 3, image 14), which was not seen in the previous
examinations. There aorticopulmonary node seen in the previous
examination appears stable. The local tumor infiltration
involving the mid portion of the left rib has increased in size
with greater associated rib destruction (series 3, image 22). In
addition, the left plueral tumor deep in the posterior sulcus
along the spine has also increased in size. In the right lung,
innumerable new pulmonary metastases along with interval
increase in previous lesions, measuring up to 13 mm and are more
extensive in the right middle lobe.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: New hypodense lesions are
noted in the liver, most likely metastases. The patient is
status post cholecystectomy. The intra- and extra-hepatic
biliary duct dilatation is unchanged. Bilateral adrenal masses
seen on the previous examination have increased in size. In
addition, multiple retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes
are noted which are new, with the left paraaortic lymph node
measuring up to 21 x 35 mm, (series 3, image 75). Enhancing foci
in the left psoas and right paraspinal seen on [**2176-6-15**]
have also increased in size. A new metastatic focus is seen in
the posterior subcutaneous tissue at the level of L3.
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Heterogeneously enhancing
foci in the
right iliacus, right gluteus, and the left quadriceps are
persistent and have increased in size. Increase in interval
pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen with the biggest lymph node
measuring 19 x 24 along the left pelvic wall, series 3, image
104.
.
BONE WINDOWS: Interval increase in the destructive left fourth
rib lesion is noted.In addition, new metastatic bony lesions are
seen in vertebrae T4- T5.
.
Multiplanar reformats were essential in delineating the findings
described above.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Post-obstructive multilobar left lung pneumonia.
2. Marked progression of metastatic disease with increase in
size of previous metastes, and development of innumerable
multiple new metastases, more prominently in the right lung.
3. Increase in left pleural effusion filling the whole of left
hemithorax
causing collapse of the left lung.
.
.
[**2184-8-3**] - PLEURAL FLUID: Gram stain negative, no growth on
culture.
.
.
[**2184-8-5**] - CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening confluent opacity in the right mid-lung zone is
concerning for superimposed pneumonia.
2. Probable increasing left pleural effusion and unchanged
collapse of the left lung.
.
.
[**2184-8-5**] - CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Rapidly progressive airspace process in the right mid-lung
and base,
which, in clinical context, may represent noncardiogenic
pulmonary edema
related to the apparent clinical transfusion reaction.
Progressive pneumonic consolidation (including endobronchial
spread of infection) and alveolar hemorrhage are additional
concerns. Progression of known pulmonary metastases is most
unlikely given the rapidity of change.
2. Complete opacification of the left hemithorax, reflecting a
combination of obstructing [**Location (un) 21851**], lung collapse and
effusion.
