SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  An 85-year-old male with history
of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, mitral
regurgitation and atrial fibrillation presenting with
increasing dyspnea on exertion, admitted for Swan-Ganz
tailored congestive heart failure therapy.

1.  CARDIAC PUMP:  The patient's initial right heart
catheterization numbers as are follows:  Wedge 24, PAP 67/22,
cardiac output 3.8, cardiac index 2, SVR 1600.  Clinically
patient appeared to be in failure with jugular venous
distention, crackles on lung exam and 3 liter nasal cannula
oxygen requirement.  He was started on a renal dosed
milrinone drip and underwent aggressive diuresis with Lasix
intravenous.  His ACE inhibitor Zestril was increased
gradually over the course of his hospitalization to 40 mg.
He was continued on his outpatient digoxin and was restarted
on aldactone at 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Although he had clinical
improvement with these measures, his Swan-Ganz numbers did
not show remarkable improvement.  His Swan-Ganz was re-sited
from his right groin to the right IJ.  Just prior to
discontinuation of the Swan-Ganz catheters, his numbers were
as follows:  PA diastolic pressures of 17 to 22, cardiac
output 4.5, cardiac index 2.3, SVR 1370, mixed venous O2
saturation of 65 (his initial mixed venous O2 saturation on
admission was 47).  The milrinone drip was slowly weaned over
the course of the patient's hospitalization and Coreg was
added to his medical regimen at 3.125 mg po twice a day.  At
the time of discharge, the patient is clinically dry with
lungs clear to auscultation, no residual O2 requirement and
negative at least 7 liters over the course of his
hospitalization.  He will continue on digoxin, aldactone,
Zestril, Coreg and Lasix as an outpatient with doses to be
titrated as tolerated.

2.  CARDIAC ISCHEMIA:  Patient with known coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft two of
three grafts patent, continued on aspirin.

3.  CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:  Patient with occasional runs
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia up to 18 beats during
hospitalization.  Given his extensive coronary artery
disease, low ejection fraction, he may benefit from EP study
and AICD placement.  This will be arranged as an outpatient.
Evaluation for biventricular pacemaker placement will also be
performed at that time.

4.  ANTICOAGULATION:  The patient has been on Coumadin as an
outpatient for a history of atrial fibrillation.  He was
maintained on a heparin drip during this hospitalization and
was restarted back on Coumadin after all procedures were
completed.  He will be discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin.

5.  PULMONARY:  At time of discharge, the patient is stable
on room air and no longer requiring supplemental oxygen.

6.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Patient with
elevated potassium up to 5.5 during hospitalization requiring
Kayexalate.  Since he remained on aldactone, Zestril and
digoxin, his potassium levels will need to be monitored
closely as an outpatient.

7.  RIGHT GROIN HEMATOMA STATUS POST RIGHT HEART
CATHETERIZATION:  The patient had a small hematoma in the
right groin with stable hematocrit throughout his
hospitalization.  The patient has had significant right lower
extremity pain from this hematoma occasionally requiring
Percocet.

8.  CODE STATUS:  The patient is full code.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge to rehabilitation in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure, status post Swan-Ganz tailored
therapy

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Zestril 40 mg po once a day
2.  Coreg 3.125 mg po twice a day
3.  Aldactone 12.5 mg po twice a day
4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg po once a day
5.  Lasix 20 mg po twice a day
6.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po once a day
7.  Coumadin 2.5 mg po q hs
8.  Lovenox 1 mg per kg subcutaneous q 12 hours
9.  Glyburide 5 mg po once a day
10. Percocet 1 to 2 tablets po q6h prn

DISCHARGE DIET:  Cardiac, diabetic

DISCHARGE TREATMENT:  The patient will need monitoring of
electrolytes, especially potassium, as well as BUN,
creatinine, INR as outpatient.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one week.  Follow up
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one month.
