History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 25889**] is a 61 y/o F with past medical history
significant for cryptogenic cirrhosis on the transplant list
with recent MELD 20 and type 2 DM who presents today due to
worsening edema and hyponatremia after discontinuing her
diuretics. The patient was recently seen in the Liver Center, at
which time she was complaining of weight gain. Labs on [**2-7**]
demonstrated creatinine 1.6 (baseline ~ 1) and sodium of 128.
She discontinued her diuretics 2-3 weeks ago per her report. She
had previously been taking 80 mg lasix daily and 200 mg
spironolactone daily. She reports increased thirst which is
constant throughout the day as well as decreased urine output.
She endorses some dyspnea especially with lying flat; her family
has noticed that her speech is softer in quality. She reports a
temperature to 99.6 with some "chills" (per her family, though
they point out slight tremor of the leg as an example). Her
family believes she is at times more forgetful but is not
currently confused.
.
She has been having [**2-18**] BMs per day but this has been more
difficult for her. She tells us that she tried to get lactulose
this week, but her pharmacy would not dispense it.
.
On review of systems, she denies recent congestion, abdominal
pain, and headache. She does have a slight cough which is not
productive. Her family noticed that her left arm was more
swollen than the right several days ago; this has improved but
persists.
.
Of note, the patient was recently discharged from the hospital
after an evaluation of her left hip pain. MRI on that admission
demonstrated normal hips with minor lower lumbar spine disc
degenerative changes. Tramadol has helped this pain.

Social History:
The patient lives with her husband who is ill. She has much
support from her two sisters and her god-daughter. They provide
care for over 12 hours per day at her home. History of alcohol
use in the past but none recently. No tobacco/drug use.

Family History:
DM, CAD. father died of unknown cancer, brother died of a
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 61F here with cirrhosis (Stage I varices) with a hospital
course complicated by UGIB, renal failure and volume overload.
Ultimately, the patient requested to be made CMO, and her health
care proxy changed her code status to meet her wishes. All
medications except morphine drip and ativan were discontinued.
Prior to the change in code status, the following issues were
addressed:
.
# Hypotension - This was attributed to her chronic liver
disease. She did appear septic at one point and her BP was
maintained on pressors. Midodrine, octreotide, vasopressin and
levophed were tried at different times to maintain her MAP>60
and UOP>20cc/hr. Eventually, CVVH was initiated several times
for volume overload and renal failure. Prior to death, the
patient's mental status deteriorated and she appears to have GI
blood loss. AT that point, the pressors were discontinued and
the patient was made CMO.
.
# Acute Renal Failure - The patient's creatinine increased
steadily and was attributed to ATN vs. hepatorenal syndrome. She
was treated for HRS with octreotide, midodrine and vasoopressin
at one point. She was started on CVVHD for fluid overload.
Levophed was used prn to maintain MAP>60 and UOP.
.
.
#ANEMIA: Hematocrit stable. Initially thought related to prev
UGIB. Has had guaiac positive stools now and appears to be
bleeding from oral mucosa on [**3-24**]. Probably has uremic platelets
as well as coagulopathy and decreased gastric perfusion
-- ddAVP for uremic platelets.
-- Will check serial hematocrits, with goal Hct > 24, will
transfuse cautiously, given concerns for volume overload
-- Continue to guaiac stools
-- Continue bicarbonate
-- Pressors to improve GI perfusion
.
# Fluid Overload - related to end-stage cryptogenic cirrhosis
and renal failure. Initially improved with blood pressure
control and CVVH. Hemodialysis line pulled for possible
infection, cultures negative to date. Was intermittently on
Bumex for diuresis; however, hold now. Pt has been maintained on
levophed gtt restarted today, since patient dropping MAPs, so
this may help with diuresis. A central line was placed to
evaluate volume status. CVPs in the 20's suggesting against
intravascular depletion.
-- Goal net negative fluid balance with fluid restriction
mainly, holding off on diuretics for now, can consider
ethacrynic acid if alright with renal.
--transfuse for HCT less than 24
--appreciate renal and liver recs
.
# Mental status changes - Uremia vs. hyperammonemia vs.
hypotension. Became more somnolent on [**2113-3-24**]. Arousable and
answers questions.
-- NPO
-- Will restart pressors
-- Check serum ammonia
-- Consider CVVHD if ammonia WNL
-- Increase lactulose if ammonia high and if not having brisk GI
bleed.
.
# Cirrhosis: endstage cyptogenic cirrhosis w/grade I varices.
MELD consistently > 30 and qualified for transplant as soon as
can get her off of pressors.
-- Considering TIPS procedure per hepatology
-- Ursodiol
-- lactulose (titrate to [**2-18**] BMs/day)
-- f/u hepatology recs
-- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25890**] discussing possible transplant ON pressors
w/surgical team, if ok, will need full cardiac w/u (ECHO, c/s
re: hypotension)
.
# PNA/PLEURAL EFFUSIONS: CT chest that showed pneumonia,
completed 8 day course of vancomycin/ciprofloxacin. [**3-8**]
developed large
