Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Date range (3) 112255**] endotracheal intubatation
[**2178-6-6**] flexible bronchoscopy
[**2178-6-8**] rigid bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
79 y.o F on coumadin for CVA and afib on coumadin who presented
to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital yesterday after an episode of hemoptysis.
At [**Hospital1 1562**], she reportedly coughed up another 200 cc of bright
red blood.  She was satting well, but was tachypneic in the high
20s and noted to have patchy opacities on CXR.  Of note, her INR
was 3.9 and she received 5mg of vitamin K and and 2U FFP.  She
was then med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Of note, the patient reportedly had been noted to have lung mass
on CXR for which her PCP was in the process of setting up
bronchoscopy.  It is unclear how much this has been worked up
already.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she received another 5mg Vitamin K and CXR was
repeated which showed bilateral patchy opacities.  labs were
significant for an INR of 2.2, Hct 36.8, WBC 12.0.  Electrolytes
unremarkable with exception of slightly elevated BUN of 25.  No
T/S sent.  Her access consisted of 2 16G and 1 18G.  No fluids
given and she was HD stable with VS: T: afeb Hr: 67 100% 160/75
RR: 25
.
On arrival to the ICU, VS were afebrile, 170s/100s, 130s, RR 40,
O2: 70s on NRB. pt had another 30cc of hemoptysis upon arrival
to ICU.  She was in moderate respiratory distress with accessory
muscle use, and complaining subjectively of shortness of breath.
 Respiratory and anesthesia were subsequently called and she was
intubated without complication.  Setting are AC O2 100%, TV 400
RR 18  PEEP 5
.
Review of systems:
As above, pt was subjectively short of breath.  Remaineder of
ROS unable to be obtained

- Peripheral neuropathy
- Bronchiectasis (has been seen by a Pulmonologist at [**Hospital1 1562**]

PATHOLOGY:
[**2178-6-6**] Bronchial clot (1 jar), Report Date [**2178-6-9**]
Blood, fibrin, and inflammatory cells, no evidence of malignancy
(bronchial clot).
[**2178-6-8**] Bronchial washings
  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Numerous acute inflammatory cells and macrophages.

ECG [**2178-6-6**]  6:02:50 AM
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST junctional depression. No major
change compared to the previous tracing.

CXR [**2178-6-6**]:
There are no previous studies available for a direct comparison.

Heart size is upper limits of normal.  Subtle density at the
left retrocardiac area which may represent atelectasis or a
developing infiltrate.  Rest of the lung fields are grossly
clear.  There are no signs for pulmonary edema or large pleural
effusions.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST [**2178-6-6**] 2:54 PM

bronchus with
imaging characteristics suggestive of secretions. Cor
