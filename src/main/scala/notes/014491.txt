Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27462**] was admitted to the service of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 363**] for a
circufrential fusion L5-S1.  She was informed and consented for
the procedure and elected to proceed.  Please see Operative Note
for procedure in detail.
Post-operatively she was administered antibiotics and pain
medication.  Due to the dural tear intra-op, she remained flat
in bed for 48 hours.  She subsequently developed a pneumonia
with low O2 saturation.  She was transfered to the MICU where a
thoracentesis was preformed.  Transudative fluid 800cc was
drained and sent for culture.  All cultures have been negative
to date.  She was placed on Vancomycin and Cefepime and a PICC
line placed for a 10 day course of antibiotics.
She was transfered out of the MICU to the floor where she was
able to work with physical therapy.  Her O2 saturation remained
high and she was discharged in stable condition.  She will
follow up in clinic in 10 days.
