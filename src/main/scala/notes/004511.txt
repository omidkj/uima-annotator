Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**]
Chief Complaint:
"Seizures"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Long-term monitoring/EEG


History of Present Illness:
23 yo RHW hx of epilepsy and bipolar d/o, incarceration, heroin
abuse who presents with multiple spells. Her rapid return to
awareness after these events raises the possibility that she may
be having non epileptic seizures as well as epileptic seizures.
She started having leg twitching movements as a child at the age
of 6. Anger control has always been an issue. She was diagnosed
with epilepsy at the age of 16 and was told that it was coming
from the "flight or fight system and that her epilepsy was too
difficult to control...." Her father and 4 [**Name2 (NI) **] daughter have
epilepsy. Her father's seizures were associated with violent
mood changes.

She did not have an LP because she did not have any signs
associated with a meningitis. There was concern for a pituitary
lesion, hence and MRI brain needs to be ordered. Her AED regimen
will need to be checked with her outpatient neurologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**Hospital3 **]). Her dilantin level was 29 at the OSH and
22 at [**Hospital1 18**]. She also has not seen a psychiatrist for a while.
She had recently been on Flagyl which may have lowered her
seizure threshold.
