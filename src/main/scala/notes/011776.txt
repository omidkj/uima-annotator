History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 95268**] is a 44 yo man with a history of recent
methamphetamine use, chronic pain, and asthma who presented to
an OSH with dyspnea, progressing to hypoxemic/hypercarbic
respiratory failure and is now being transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management.  Mr. [**Known lastname 95268**]  presented to [**Hospital3 4107**]
with a 3 days of generalized malaise, URI symptoms and
progressive shortness of breath.  He had been started on Biaxin
for possible bronchitis the day prior to admission, but was more
somnolent the next morning and his wife called the rescue squad.
 By report from the outside hospital, history revealed that he
had smoked crystal meth 5 days prior to admission.  No fevers or
chills.

On admission to the OSH ([**2121-3-1**])  he had a blood gas of
7.36/50/74.  He was subsequently started on 70% oxygen with a
gas of 7.41/40/53.  CXR revealed bilateral pulmonary
infiltrates, with consolidation in the left upper lobe and the
right base per outside hospital report, that were felt to be due
to pneumonia versus inhalation injury from crystal meth.  He
went on to require nonrebreather and then BiPap.  Of note he was
afebrile throughout his hospital course, but did have a
leukocytosis with of 12,000 on admission rising as high as
25,800 on [**3-2**].  A bronchoscopy was performed on [**3-2**] which
showed 2900 WBCs, mostly neutrophils, but so far gram stain and
culture negative.  His blood cultures, urine cultures and sputum
cultures have all been no growth to date.  He was started on
Vanc/Levo and Bactrim to cover for PCP (HIV test negative 2
months prior).  He was also placed on IV steroids given the
possibility of PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] positive troponin was also noted, which
increased to 1.22  with some nonspecifioc EKG changes per report
(no prior study for comparison) which was thought to be due to
demand.  On [**3-2**] he became increasingly short of breath and his
gas was 7.2/81/91, and the decision was made to intubate him at
that time.  He was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P

Mr. [**Known lastname 95268**] is a 44 yo man with a history of methamphetamine
use, chronic pain, and asthma who presented with dyspnea,
progressing to hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure as well
as elevated troponin, and is now being transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for further management.

1.  Acute Respiratory failure, unclear etiology - On arrival to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was intubated, with CXR showing bilateral
interstitial infiltrates, and appearance of the chest x ray was
consistant with infectious pneumonia versus pulmonary edema
versus injury from drug inhalation.  It was felt that infection
was likley given the leukocytosis with bandemia, although he had
been afebrile.  He was treated with a course of Vanc/Levo as
well as Bactrim given radiographic appearance that was
concerning for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also continued on steroids and nebs
to treat any COPD component that may be present.  He had a
negative serology for HIV 2 months ago, and repeat test from
[**Hospital3 4107**] was also negative.  Ucx, Bcx and BAL from OSH
were negative.  Blood cultures from [**Hospital1 18**] were negative.  BAL
done on the day of admission showed purulent material in the
RLL, but cultures were negative as was AFB and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2733**].
Bactrim was discontinued.  He was ventilated per ARDSnet
protocol with initial requirements for PEEP of 15 and high FiO2
to maintain oxygenation.  The hypoxia improved and he was able
to be weaned to minimal vent settings over the course of several
days, concurrent with improvement of the infiltrates on his CXR.
 Of note, sedation was a problem for him as he became quite
agitated on Fentanyl/Versed drip.  He was maintained on propofol
for sedation, with baseline levels of Fentanyl and Diazepam to
treat/prevent any withdrawl (high home levels of home benzo and
opiate).  He had several aspiration events over the course of
hospitalization whenever his sedation was lightened.  He was
able to be extubated on hospital day 5, and did well although he
continued to be tachypnic, likely from continued anxiety and
perhaps benzo withdrawl.  Vanc and flagyl were discontinued at
day 7, and Levofloxacin was continued for completion of a 14 day
course.  He completed his course, and was off oxygen at
discharge.
.
2.Elevated Troponin - Troponin was elevated at the OSH peaking
at 1.22 with report of minor nonspecific ST changes on EKG, and
no elevated CK.  Troponin was already declining when he left for
transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**] and continued to trend down in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
EKG here showed no evidence of ischemic change and TTE was
normal.  Troponin bump was felt to be most likely due to demand
ischemia.  Given his risk factors (smoking, HTN, Hyperlipidemia,
he would likely benefit from an outpatient stress test. He was
treated here with 81mg ASA, Statin, B blocker.
.
3.  Asthma/COPD - Mr. [**Known lastname 95268**] has a known diagnosis of asthma,
and his lungs appeared somewha
