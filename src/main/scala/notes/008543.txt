History of Present Illness:
-- per admitting hospitalist --
74 year-old man presents with fatigue, chills, and poor PO
intake over one month. Patient reports that two months ago, he
was able to walk 30 minutes/day with weights, but over the few
weeks prior to admission, he has felt fatigued and is more
easily fatigued.  He has daytime somnolence and night insomnia.
He denies any localizing symptoms. He denies nausea, vomiting,
anorexia, abdominal pain, melena, BRBPR, new lymphadenopathy,
meningismus. Patient denies weight loss, but on review of the
records, patient has lost 10 pounds over one month. He reports
lightheadedness and dizziness with standing for several weeks.

Of note, he presented to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2184-2-12**] with fatigue and
weakness. He was found to have a low normal TSH (0.46) and low
free T4 (0.9). He was referred to endocrinology for evaluation
of central hypothyroidism. He was also found to be anemia to Hct
of 30 with his last checked Hct 41.6 six years prior with anemia
labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his vitals were T 103.5, HR 125, BP 96/ 52, RR 18,
98% on RA. He was found to be markedly dehydrated. A right groin
line was placed and he was given 7L of IVF. He remained
hypotensive at 81/46, so he was started on Levophed 0.2. He was
given Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Decadron as he was initially
alert and oriented x3 but tangential in thought for concern for
meningitis. His mental status improved with hydration therefore
LP was not pursued.

Past Medical History:
Coronary artery disease s/p cardiac cath in [**2175**]
Hypertension
Chronic renal insufficiency

Social History:
Patient is a former smoker, quit at age 42. Used to drink beer

with three children.

CXR [**2184-3-6**] IMPRESSION: No definite pneumonia, but PA/lateral
recommended when clinically feasible given tenting along right
hemidiaphragm.

CT ABD/PEL [**2184-3-9**]:
1. Faint pulmonary ground-glass opacities may represent atypical
infection or small airways inflammation.
2. Splenomegaly.
3. Bilateral adrenal nodules.
4. Severe atherosclerotic disease, with likely high-grade
stenosis of the
left renal artery origin.
5. Small fusiform dilatation of infrarenal aorta.
6. Small hypoattenuating renal lesions, too small to
characterize by CT
criteria.

VQ LUNG SCAN [**2184-3-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Intermediate-level suspicion (30-40%) for PE.

CTA CHEST [**2184-3-12**]:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Mild subpleural inter- and intra-septal thickening with lower
lobe
predominance but without honeycombing, raising suspicion for
interstitial lung disease such as NSIP or early UIP. Recommend
followup in six months with HRCT in prone position.
3. AP-elongation of upper trachea and lunate-shaped lower
trachea,
incompletely assess but suspicious for tracheobronchomalacia.
Recommend
followup with dedicated CT trachea if clinically indicated.
4. Marked coronary artery calcification.
5. Right adrenal nodule, grossly unchanged.

BONE MARROW BX [**2184-3-13**]:
1.  MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR (80-90% CELLULAR) MYELOID DOMINANT
BONE MARROW WITH DYSERYTHROPOIESIS AND DYSMEGAKARYOPOIESIS, SEE
NOTE 1.
2.  INCREASED IRON STORES WITH DECREASED SIDEROBLAST SUGGESTIVE
OF ANEMIA OF INFLAMMATORY BLOCK.
3. MILD PLASMACYTOSIS, SEE NOTE 2.

NOTE 1: In a patient with cytopenias, the marrow findings of
hypercellularity and dyspoiesis raise the possibility of
involvement by a myelodysplastic process.  Please correlate with
clinical findings to exclude other secondary causes of marrow
insults which may lead to dyspoietic changes; suggest follow-up
and repeat biopsy, if cytopenia persists in the absence of
identifiable secondary causes. Please correlate with cytogenetic
findings.
NOTE 2. Plasma cells are 3% of aspirate differential and 10-15%
of marrow core biopsy cellularity by CD138 staining. However, by
immunoglobulin light chain staining, plasma cells appear
polytypic with a slight lambda predominance, and morphologic
findings diagnostic of a plasma cell myeloma are not seen in
material evaluated. Please correlate with clinical, other
laboratory (e.g. SPEP, UPEP etc) and radiologic findings.

CT HEAD [**2184-3-13**] IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage, edema, or evidence of
acute process.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2184-3-15**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a promient fat pad.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2176-3-18**], posterior wall hypokinesis cannot be
definitively identified. No vegetations identified, but the
images are suboptimal. If clinically indicated, a
transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended.

RIGHT TEMPORAL ARTERY BIOPSY [**2184-3-18**]: Temporal artery with
intimal hyperplasia.  No arteritis seen.
