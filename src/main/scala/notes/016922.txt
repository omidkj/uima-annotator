History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4587**] is a 65 year old man with multiple medical problems
including stage [**Name (NI) 1105**] CKD, DM2, CAD, PVD, and schizophrenia in
addition to multiple pulmonary issues including ex-smoker with
unclear severity/diagnosis of COPD, chronically elevated left
hemidiaphragm, a history of pulmonary embolism on Coumadin,
complex sleep disordered breathing (with central and obstructive
sleep apnea), likely obesity hypoventilation and likely
secondary pulmonary hypertension (by TTE). He was recently
admitted and discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-14**] after being treated
for ARF attributed to hypovolemia and poor cardiac function and
a supratherapeutic INR. The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 7137**], but on the morning of [**1-15**] was noted to be more somnolent
and confused. At that time, his O2 sats were in the 80-90s and
he was placed on CPAP during transport.

In the ED, initial VS were:  97.9 80 118/81 30 98%
Non-Rebreather. His initial ABG was 7.35/69/67/40. The patient
became more talkative and arousable initially. He also had an
elevated INR to 3.7, hyperkalemic to 5.2, Cr 2.1. He had an EKG
that showed a stable RBBB and a Trop that was slightly elevated
to 0.06. Cards was consulted due to thought of CHF exacerbation,
but they did not think he had significant pulmonary edema. Later
in the AM as the patient was maintained on facemask, he became
more somnolent and altered. Another ABG was 7.24/98/122/44. The
patient was placed on BiPap and brought to the MICU for
management of his hypercarbic respiratory failure.

On arrival to the MICU, VS were afebrile, 117/68, 65, 99% on
BiPap 10/5, 50%. The patient says that he is feeling a lot
better and wants his mask off so that he can watch tv.  Without
BIPAP he desatted in the the 80s.  He had no complaints except
an itchy foot and some mild abdominal pain.  He did not have any
chest pain.

ECHO [**2115-1-16**]:
The left ventricle is not well seen. The aortic valve is not
well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. IMPRESSION:
Suboptimal image quality. At least moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Cannot accurately assess ventricular function or
valvular structure and function. If clinically indicated, a TEE
may allow for estimation of left ventricular systolic function
and evaluation of valvular morphology. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-23**], left and right ventricular
function cannot reliably be assessed.

CXR [**2115-1-16**]:
Left hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated responsible for
persistent severe left lower lobe atelectasis. Increasing
opacification in the mid and lower lung zones since [**1-15**]
could be worsening dependent edema, since there is substantial
pulmonary vascular and mediastinal venous engorgement in the
setting of severe chronic cardiomegaly, but pneumonia should
also be considered, particularly aspiration. The bilateral
pleural effusions are unchanged. No pneumothorax.

CXR [**2115-1-22**]:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-16**]:
Previous mild pulmonary edema has almost entirely cleared, with
some residual in the right mid and lower lung zones. Marked
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is longstanding, unchanged.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is also a chronic finding.
Previous small left pleural effusion has decreased, and
mediastinal vascular engorgement has improved.
