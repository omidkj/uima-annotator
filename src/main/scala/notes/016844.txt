[**2116-10-25**] Head CT :
1. Right temporoparietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Likely nondisplaced left temporal bone fracture with fluid in
the mastoid air cells, which could be better evaluated on
temporal bone CT. Likely nondisplaced fracture of the lateral
right orbital wall and a possible nondisplaced fracture of the
right zygomatic arch.
3. Linear hyperdensity along the right temporal dural space
could be related to small subdural hematoma. No midline shift.
4. Left parietal and occipital midline subgaleal hematoma.
5. Right supraorbital soft tissue swelling.

[**2116-10-25**] CTA Torso :
1. Severe pubic symphysis diastasis as above and right iliac
[**Doctor First Name 362**] diastased fracture extending to the right sacroiliac joint.
Nondisplaced left pubic bone fracture.
2. Extraperitoneal bladder rupture. A perineal arterial
extravasation was
noted on the initial [**Hospital 8050**] hospital study but cannot be
assessed on the
current examination due to extraluminal contrast from the
bladder rupture.
3. Sternal fracture with substernal/anterior mediastinal
hematoma increased in size compared to prior.
4. Small bilateral pneumothoraces. Bilateral consolidations
likely related
to a combination of atelectasis and aspiration.
5. Findings concerning for left renal lower pole contusion.
6. Peripancreatic fluid with fluid anterior to the portal vein
concerning for pancreatic injury.
7. Haziness of the mesentery could be related to motion, but
mesenteric
injury cannot be excluded.
8. Multiple right one through seventh and tenth and left first
through eighth and twelfth rib fractures. Right clavicular
fracture. Left one through five lumbar vertebral transverse
process fractures.
9. Possible small focus of right popliteal artery extravasation.


[**2116-10-25**] CT sinus/mandible :
1. Likely left temporal bone fracture. Temporal bone CT can be
obtained for further evaluation.
2. Nondisplaced right lateral orbital wall fracture. Possible
nondisplaced
right zygomatic arch fracture.

[**2116-10-26**] CT Head :
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage as described which appears similar to
the prior
studies. No new hemorrhage.
2. Ventricles smaller than on prior study, which could indicate
increased
intracranial pressure. However, no midline shift, or evidence
for herniation.
3. Partial opacification of the left mastoids could indicate an
occult
fracture at this site. If indicated, a temporal bone CT could be
performed.
4. Subgaleal hematomas as described

[**2116-10-26**] Left tib/fib :
1. Right iliac crest fracture with diastasis of pubic symphysis
and right SI joint, in overall improved alignment status post
external fixator placement.
2. Avulsion fracture of left lateral tibial condyle, concerning
for
underlying ACL injury.
3. Extraluminal contrast in pelvis, consistent with known
bladder rupture.

[**2116-10-26**] MRI C spine :
1. No evidence of fracture or subluxation.
2. Mild prevertebral fluid at C3-C4 level. However, the anterior

longitudinal ligament appears intact.
3. No evidence of signal abnormality in the cervical spinal
cord.

[**2116-10-31**] Head CT :
1. Interval decrease of the diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, but
residual
cerebral edema.
2. No intracranial herniation, no midline shift, acute
territorial
infarction.
3. Stable fluid level in the sphenoid sinus and fluid in the
mastoid air
cells, which might indicate an occult fracture.

[**2116-11-1**] MRA Neck and brain :
1. Findings indicative of diffuse axonal injury.
2. Small bilateral parietal and occipital subdural hematomas are
identified measuring approximately 2-3 mm and without
significant mass effect.
3. Evidence of subarachnoid blood as was known from the previous
CT
examination of the head.
4. No evidence of transtentorial or foramen magnum herniation.

[**2116-11-7**] Left lower ext ultrasound :
No DVT. Large amount of pooling mainly simple fluid with
scattered more solid components in the anterior subcutaneous
tissues of the lower leg over the tibia/fibula, likely reflect
resolving hematoma. No evidence of abscess formation.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32496**] was airlifted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital in
[**Location (un) 8641**], NH on [**2116-10-25**] where she was triaged after horse
trampling.  Injuries upon arrival and hospital course are
indicated by system:

Neuro:
#R temporoparietal SAH, nonoperative management. Repeat head CT
on HD7 revealed and interval decrease of the diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage, but residual cerebral edema. #L
nondisplaced temporal bone fracture, nonoperative.
#L parietal and occipital midline subgaleal hematoma,
nonoperative.
#R lateral orbital wall fracture, nonoperative.
Ms. [**Known lastname 32496**] was sedated and unconscious upon presentation, and
she was kept sedated with propofol and fentanyl. On HD6, the
propofol was discontinued; however, Ms. [**Known lastname 32496**] was unresponsive
to command
