Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, arterial line placement, right internal jugular line
central line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history of
coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes
mellitus, CVA, and multiple other medical problems, recently
discharged yesterday from [**Hospital1 18**] who presented with respiratory
distress.

Per report, patient was having difficulty breathing, and EMS was
called to her nursing home. Her oxygen saturations at the
nursing home were in the 50's. Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**]
emergency room, her oxygen saturation was measured to be in the
80's and she clearly audible wheezing. She was mannually bagged
for oxygenation in the emergency room. A femoral line was placed
as other access was difficult to obtain.

Her son, who is her HCP, was [**Name (NI) 653**] from the emergency room,
and her full code status in regards to intubationwas confirmed.
After that time she was intubated and given rocuronium 6 mg,
etomidate 20 mg, and transiently was on a nitro gtt.  She was
given doses of vancomycin and zosyn to cover for possible
pneumonia in setting of recent hospitalizations. She was also
given 100 mg IV lasix, and had put out 600cc of urine prior to
arrival to the floor.

At time of transfer, her systolic blood pressure was in the
90's. Her heart rate was 100-120, and her respiratory rate was
25. She had been placed on assist control, with the following
settings: 400/14/5/100%. Upon arrival to the floor, she was not
responsive to any commands, and appeared comfortable.

very independent prior to CVA.


Family History:
Unable to obtain.

Physical Exam:
Upon arrival to MICU:
General: Elderly female, intubated, thin but edematous appearing
HEENT: Temporal wasting bilaterally. Left pupil>right, both
reactive. No scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor. Slightly
dry MM.
Neck: Elevated JVP.
Lungs: Transmitted upper airway noise, rhoncherous, bilateral
breath sounds
Cardiac: Borderline tachycardic, regular, possible systolic
murmur
Abdomen: Edematous, soft, ND, +soft BS, PEG in place
Extr: Edematous, pitting throughout (weaping of serous fluid at
site of a-line attempt). 1+ radial, PT/DP bilaterally.
Neurologic: Pupils reactive, withdrawals feet slightly to
noxious stimuli, otherwise not responsive.
Skin: No lesions, ecchymoses over abdomen consistent with
injection sites.


Pertinent Results:
[**2113-10-27**]:
EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Prolonged A-V conduction. Intra-atrial
conduction defect. Left anterior hemiblock. Left ventricular
hypertrophy is probably present. Since the previous tracing of
[**2113-10-25**] sinus tachycardia is now present.

[**2113-10-27**] Chest X-ray:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
change in
radiographic position of the endotracheal tube. The tip of the
tube is still at the origin of the right main bronchus. In
unchanged manner, a small left-sided pleural effusion and a
small left-sided retrocardiac atelectasis is seen. The right
lung has normal volume, but the transparency of the perihilar
lung parenchyma has slightly decreased. No right-sided pleural
effusion. Degenerative changes of the right shoulder.

[**2113-10-28**] Chest X-ray:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the
endotracheal tube still projects over the carina. There is a
newly inserted central venous access line over the right
internal jugular vein. The tip of the line projects over the
mid-to-low SVC. The extent of the left-sided pleural effusion
has slightly increased. There is moderate retrocardiac
atelectasis.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.
No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of
pneumonia.

[**2113-10-30**] Chest X-ray:
FINDINGS: The right IJ line has its tip projecting 1 cm distally
of the
carina over the right main bronchus. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax.  The size of the cardiac silhouette, the left
basal opacity, and the position of the endotracheal tube are
unchanged.

[**2113-10-30**] Chest X-ray:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-22**] through [**10-30**], 3:54
a.m.:
Mild edema has developed in the right lower lung. Left lower
lobe is
chronically collapsed, small left pleural effusion unchanged.
Moderate
cardiomegaly unchanged. ET tube in standard placement.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of congestive heart
failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and prior
CVA who presents from her nursing home with respiratory
distress, intubated in the emergency room for hypoxia, acidemia,
hypercarbia, and increased work of breathing.

#) Respiratory failure: It was suspected that the patient's
respiratory failure was multifactorial. She was hypercarbic in
the emergency room, and may have tired out in the setting of
volume overloaded state, with possible flash pulmonary edema.
This was consistent with a BNP of >70,000 and her edematous
state. Given that her extremities were cool and her lactate was
elevated, sepsis from a hospital-acquired pneumonia was also a
consideration in the setting of her recent admissions and
intubations/extubations. She was given 100 mg of IV lasix in the
emergency room and put out over 600 cc, but then developed
hypotension limiting further diuresis. She also has marked
pulmonary hypertension which could also have contributed, and
was at risk for aspiration given prior CVA.

Patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible
hospital acquired pneumonia, with vancomycin given her history
of MRSA in sputum, and zosyn. She was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction; she had mildly elevated troponin values (0.05-0.08)
which were within her baseline and felt to be related to her
renal insufficiency. Her CK and CK-MB remained within normal
limits.

After the patient's blood pressure stabalized based on arterial
line tracings, diuresis was initiated with a lasix drip for her
congestive heart failure.

#) Hypothermia: Per report, patient was hypothermic in the
emergency room. Upon arrival to the intensive care unit,
however, she was normothermic. Her extremities remained
intermittently cool, and there was concern for cardiogenic shock
and peripheral vasoconstriction. A TSH and cortisol were within
normal limits. Her lactate initially trended down to normal.

#) Systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure: Based on the
patient's clinical exam, imaging, and laboratories (BNP
>70,000), it was felt that an exacerbati
