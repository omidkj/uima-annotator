DISCHARGE DATE:  Pending.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53 year old woman nine
months status post cadaveric renal transplant for adult
polycystic kidney disease with postoperative course
complicated by pericardial effusion status post drainage and
eventual window followed by reactivation CMV infections and
then MRSA bacteremia endocarditis status post two courses of
vancomycin. She presents two weeks after completion of her
second course of vancomycin after waking up the morning prior
to admission with temps to 103. She took four Tylenol and the
temperature came down to 99. She went to sleep but woke up
the morning of admission with persistent temperature, called
her cousin to bring her into the Emergency Room and was also
noted to have confusion, lethargy with some nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, headaches and generalized achiness all over. She
denied any focal symptoms of cough, runny nose or chronic
sinusitis. She was short of breath but has a history of
asthma, unclear if changed from baseline. She did become
dyspneic while talking to us on examination but denied chest
pain, abdominal pain, dysuria.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 104.4.
blood pressure 140/52, heart rate 120, respiratory rate 18,
sating 98 percent on room air. In general, she was confused,
ill-appearing in no acute distress, talking complete
sentences with mild dyspnea. HEENT - pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light. There were moist mucous membranes.
Extraocular muscles were intact. Heart was regular and
tachycardic with normal S1 and S2, [**2-6**] murmur loudest at the
apex. Pulmonary exam was clear to auscultation bilaterally
with no wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds, positive
palpable kidney in her right lower quadrant. Extremities - no
edema, no splinter, [**Last Name (un) 1003**] or Osler lesions. Neurologic exam
- she was initially oriented times two. Cranial nerves were
intact and good strength and sensation in all four
extremities.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white count was 10.8, hematocrit
28.0, platelets 209, sodium 138, K 4.3, chloride 101, bicarb
22, BUN 43, creatinine 2.6, glucose 299, calcium 8.8,
magnesium 1.5, CK 46, troponin 0.20. Albumin was 3.7. INR was
1.5. ALT was 8, AST 12, amylase 32, alkaline phosphatase 91,
LDH 338, lipase of 15 and total bilirubin of 0.9. EKG was
sinus tachycardic at 106 as well as left axis, no LVH, T wave
inversions in AVL and T wave flattening in V5 through V6.
Chest x-ray showed linear atelectasis within the mid left
lung zone, probable pulmonary arterial hypertension and
pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 53 year old woman with adult
polycystic kidney disease status post renal transplant in
[**2161-8-3**] complicated by MRSA endocarditis of the mitral
valve in [**Month (only) 956**] and [**2162-3-4**] with also a pericardial
effusion requiring window in [**2162-1-3**] who presents with
fever, mental status changes and acute renal failure. The
patient was initially admitted to the MICU, was started on
vancomycin, Zosyn and ceftriaxone and had TEE done in the
Emergency Department. TEE confirmed mitral valve vegetations
that were changing in size from her previous TEE. Later that
evening in the MICU, the patient had an LP done with 700
white blood cells and poly predominance and 200 white blood
cells, initially gram stain negative for 4+ PMNs. She also
initially had CT and MRI of the head which were essentially
negative. Blood cultures drawn in the Emergency Department
came back later that evening with two out two and then four
out of four gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters which
apparently turned into MRSA. The patient's mental status
improved and the patient was transferred to the floor.

PROBLEM LIST:  MRSA bacteremia:  The patient continued to
have positive blood cultures during her hospitalization. The
patient was continued on vancomycin, started on rifampin and
was also treated with a seven day course of gentamicin to
help try to clear her of her MRSA bacteremia as she did
continue to have temperature spikes and had a PICC line
placed to continue these antibiotics. Blood cultures remained
stable but she did have positive blood cultures, on [**5-3**],
four out of six on day of admission, on [**5-6**] two out of
two, [**5-7**] and 5 were still negative, [**5-9**] was one out of
two with MRSA, [**5-11**] four out of four negative and [**5-14**]
one out of one is MRSA. At the time of this dictation, [**5-17**]
and [**5-18**] cultures are still pending. Of note, the patient
did have CSF culture grow MRSA later on in the course even
with the negative gram stain. This was attributed likely to a
high grade bacteremia that penetrated the blood-brain
barrier. The patient's mental status improved by the
following morning. The patient eventually had an MRI of her C-
spine, L-spine and T-spine to rule out any parameningeal
focuses and this was done and showed no definite evidence of
an abscess. She did have some mild degenerative disc disease
in her cervical spine but was otherwise stable. The patient
did have the initial TEE in the Emergency Room which showed
LVEF of 55 percent and mild thickening of the aortic valve
but no masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened with a large
1.5 x 1.2 cm calcified mass on the atrial side of the base of
the posterior mitral valve leaflet consistent with a healed
vegetation and there was also a large 1.5 x 1.0 cm calcified
mass on the atrial side of the base of the anterior mitral
valve leaflet consistent with a healed vegetation. There was
a small 0.5 filamentous, mobile echodensity associated with
the base of the anterior mitral valve leaflet on the atrial
side consistent with a vegetation but no mitral valve abscess
was seen at the time and there was moderate to severe 3+ MR
seen during this TEE. Otherwise, there was no evidence of an
effusion and was otherwise stable. She was followed initially
by CT Surgery and seen for evaluation for possible surgery.
However, surgery was deferred at this time as she continued
to have transiently positive blood cultures and they wanted
her bacteremia cleared prior to surgery as she would present
a risk of infection of her eventual bioprosthetic valve. The
patient was continued on vancomycin, rifampin and completed a
seven day course of gentamicin for synergy and cultures
remained stable. The patient did eventually have a repeat TEE
to evaluate any further changes in her valve and that did
show that the mitral valve leaflets were moderately
thickened. There was a large complex vegetation 2 x 2 cm on
the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with mobile
elements. In addition, there are moderate to large mobile
vegetations involving the anterior mitral leaflet and leaflet
base. A perivalvular involvemen
