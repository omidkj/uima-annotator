Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of PA catheter


History of Present Illness:
This is a 65M who was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension in
[**2195**] who was electively admitted for initiation on Flolan
therapy.  His pulmonary hypertension is thought to be due to
COPD and obstructive sleep apnea.  Pt reports that his activity
is limited to walking from bed to his bathroom at home secondary
to his shortness of breath.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 29721**] was originally diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension
in [**2196-2-20**] when he was hospitalized in [**Location (un) 3844**] for
dyspnea.  At the time, he was diagnosed with obstructive sleep
apnea and treated with CPAP. His workup included a cardiac
catheterization that revealed one-vessel coronary artery disease
and severe pulmonary hypertension.  He was started on Tracleer,
sildenafil and warfarin but continued to be symptomatic and was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a second opinion in [**2197-1-22**].  He had
a right heart catheterization with nitric oxide reactivity
series on [**2197-3-14**], which demonstrated severe pulmonary
hypertension with baseline PA pressures of 70/29 mmHg, PCWP of
14 mmHg, cardiac index 2.1 liters/min/m2 and pulmonary vascular
resistance of 532 dynes/s/cm5.  With 100% FIO2, the PA pressure
reduced to 51/25 mmHg and PVR reduced to 370 dynes/s/cm5.  There
was no evidence of significant left-to-right shunting.
.
In addition to cardiac catheterization, he had a dobutamine
stress echocardiogram on [**2197-2-1**] that demonstrated
normal left ventricular ejection fraction without inducible
ischemia, no significant valvular disease but with a moderately
dilated right ventricle and evidence of impaired LV relaxation.

.
ROS:  Significant for runny nose, occasional cough and diarrhea
and left shoulder pain.  Otherwise negative.

Chest X-ray ([**2197-4-26**])- In comparison with the study of [**3-23**], there
has been placement of a right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter that extends
well into the right pulmonary artery system beyond the confines
of the mediastinum. No evidence of pneumothorax.  No acute focal
pneumonia.
.
Chest X-ray ([**2197-4-29**]) - As compared to the previous radiograph,
the Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. The introduction sheath
is still in place in the right internal jugular vein. There is
no evidence of pneumothorax. Unchanged normal size of the
cardiac silhouette, absence of pneumonia or of overhydration. No
pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
A&P:  65M with severe pulmonary hypertension electively admitted
to initiate Flolan therapy.
.
#  Pulmonary Hypertension - Patient with symptomatic,
functionally limiting pulmonary hypertension was admitted for
trial of Flolan infusion. A PA catheter was palced on arrival
with PCWP of 12, PA pressures of 50-60/20's. He was continued on
home doses of Tracleer and sildenafil. Flolan infusion was
intiiated at a starting dose of Flolan 2ng/kg/min, then
uptitrates by 2ng/kg/min every hour. He initially tolerated the
medication well with mild flushing, headache and
lightheadedness, but then at 6ng/kg/min he developed flash
pulmonary edema with development of respiratory distress and
increased oxygen requirement. Flolan was downtitrated, symptoms
were managed and patient stabilized with eventual reinitiation
of Flolan at a slower rate of titration. He did not tolerate the
medication however developing recurrent respiratory distress
several times therefore not reaching even the target dose of
8ng/kg/min. His primary pulmonary team determined that he was
not a good candidate for Flolan therapy and the medication was
stopped. He was stable on home dose of oxygen at discharge and
at baselne in terms of respiratory status.
.
#  Hypertension - He was continued on home regimen of lisinopril
with systolic blood pressures in 90-110's.
.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure - He was continued on his home
dose of lasix.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease - Known 75% mid LAD stenosis, mild
diagonal disease 40% proximal circumflex stenosis and a 40-50%
PDA stenosis. He was continued on aspirin, ACe inhibitor
.
# CRI : Patient received several extra doses of IV lasix for
episodes of flash pulmonary edema with subsequent increase in
creatinine to 1.6 at discharge. He was instructed to liberalize
fluid intake and follow-up for repeat creatinine several days
after discharge
.
# Diabetes Mellitus - He was initially kept on insulin sliding
scale, but then transitiuoned back to home dose of metformin
with good overall blood sugar control.
.
# Obstructive Sleep Apnea - Continued on home CPAP
.
#  COPD - Stable, continued on home oxygen
.
#  GERD - Continued on PPI.
