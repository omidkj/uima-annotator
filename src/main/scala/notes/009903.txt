CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)

FINDINGS: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The aorta
is unfolded and calcified. Pulmonary vasculature is likely
within normal limits. There appears to be chronic pleural
thickening on the lateral view. Patchy opacity is seen
posteriorly on the lateral view of uncertain chronicity. There
is no focal consolidation. Osseous structures are demineralized
with degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. A right bipolar
humeral prosthesis is present.

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT

RIGHT FOOT, TWO VIEWS. Comparison is made to [**2135-4-27**]. The
third toe has been amputated from the base of the proximal
phalanx. There is demineralization and mottling of the distal
first metatarsal head with several ossified fragments seen
medial to the metatarsal head. There is also shortening of the
proximal right first phalanx. The appearance appears slightly
different than on [**4-27**], but findings could be due to
positioning. Other metatarsals and phalanges also demonstrate
minimal mottling which could be due to demineralization.
Osteomyelitis cannot be excluded.

EKG

Baseline artifact
Sinus bradycardia
Borderline left axis deviation - is nonspecific
Consider prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction
Q-Tc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure
Diffuse nonspecific low amplitude T waves
Clinical correlation is suggested for in part metabolic/drug
effect
Since previous tracing of [**2135-5-5**], probably no significant
change but baseline artifact makes comparison difficult

ECHO

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.9 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.7 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *5.6 cm (nl <= 5.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 70% to 80% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Valve Level: 3.2 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.7 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.8 m/sec
Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.6 m/sec
Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 1.33
Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 220 msec

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Small LV cavity. Suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.
Hyperdynamic LVEF. Mid-cavitary gradient. No LV mass/thrombus.
No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Complex (>4mm and/or mobile)
atheroma in
aortic root. Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Thickened/fibrotic tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS.
Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apicalviews.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A mild mid-cavitary gradient
is identified. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm and/or mobile) atheroma in the aortic root.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse.Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2134-9-23**], the tricuspid regurgitation is significantly
reduced; otherwise no major change.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)

FINDINGS: The left cephalic and basilic veins are patent. No
right basilic or cephalic veins were identified. The greater
saphenous veins were patent bilaterally. Please see digitized
data sheets for exact venous dimensions.

Reason: ISCHEMIC FEET

COMPARISON: Lower extremity noninvasive arterial studies from
[**2134-2-5**].

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Continuous Doppler ultrasound
examination was performed at the level of the bilateral lower
extremities, revealing triphasic signals at the bilateral
femoral and popliteal levels with absent signals at the
bilateral tibial leve
