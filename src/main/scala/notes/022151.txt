Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bilateral chest tubes placed [**2189-8-31**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75yo woman with critical AS, CHF (EF 30%), complete
heart block s/p pacemaker, HCV, hypothyroidism, recently
diagnosed aggressive B cell lymphoma c/b SVC syndrome s/p Y
stent and subsequent removal, C3D+11 reduced R-CHOP. Recently
admitted for hypotension and anemia/thrombocytopenia requiring
transfusions in the setting of her critical AS. She was given
500cc IVF for SBP in the 80s, with good response to her baseline
SBP of 90s-100s. She was then transfused 1unit PRBCs and 1 bag
of platelets, and given a dose of Neupogen. Since discharge, she
has been feeling more dyspneic, with symptoms increasing over
the last 3-4 days while at home. She also describes occasional
cough and clear phlegm production. She denies fevers or chills,
but noted a "rising temp" and generalized weakness. She also
describes increasing difficulty swallowing and odynophagia. She
denies any chest pain, abd pain, nausea, vomiting, change in
bowel habits, or dysuria. Her home health nurse has also noted
increasing accessory muscle use and adventitious lung sounds.

In the ED, initial VS: Temp 98.4 F, HR 88, BP 96/56, RR 18, SaO2
100% 2L NC. She was 93% on RA, which improved to 97% on 2L O2
NC. Exam was notable for decreased BS on the right. She
otherwise appeared comfortable and not tachypneic. She was
speaking in full sentences and A&Ox3. Labs included WBC 10.2
(86% PMNs), stable H&H, Plts, and normal INR. Chemistries
notable for Na 133, K 3.2, Cl 90, HCO3 34. Other labs included
BNP [**Numeric Identifier 23459**], normal trop and lactate. Blood culture was sent and
is pending. ECG was V-paced at 88 bpm with lateral ST
depressions, unchanged on repeat. CXR with increasing pleural
effusion from previous. Interventional pulmonology fellow was
alerted. She was given PO K 40 mEq but she vomited the pills. No
IV fluids or Abx were given. She is admitted for further care.
VS prior to transfer: Temp 97.6 F, HR 91, BP 99/76, RR 20, SaO2
96% 2L NC.

ROS: As listed above in the HPI. All other systems are negative.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGY HISTORY: Aggressive B cell lymphoma
[**3-/2189**]: Presented to PCP with neck and facial swelling. Referred
to allergy and ENT with neck CT revealing SVC syndrome from
extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Chest CT showed right
supraclavicular mass displacing trachea and massive mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.
[**Date range (3) 23460**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with c/o 2 months of facial
swelling, poor appetite and 10 lbs weight loss.
[**2189-5-11**]: Bronchoscopy with diagnostic EBUS-TBNA revealed B
cell lymphoma although minimal specimen was obtained. LDH was
314. Silicone Y stent placed for extrinsic compression in light
of [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] respiratory symptoms.
TREATMENT HISTORY:
 *  Received two doses of emergency radiation therapy on
[**2189-5-15**], a dose of Cytoxan on [**2189-5-16**] and three-fifth dose
of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy starting on [**2189-5-20**] that had to be
aborted secondary to failure of her vascular access.  Repeat CT
chest showed a widely patent Y stent and she was discharged to
home [**2189-5-26**].
 * Admitted on [**2189-6-1**] with hypotension (SBP 80s) with
increasing dyspnea for further evaluation.  Mediastinal biopsy
on [**2189-6-3**] was nondiagnostic and the Y stent was removed.
 * 2nd cycle of [**Hospital1 **] (dose level 1) given on [**2189-6-8**],
requiring increasing doses of Lasix to maintain her volume
status.
 * [**2189-6-11**], developed non-occlusive PICC associated thrombus
in the brachial vein extending into the axillary vein.  Given
her difficult access, it was decided to leave PICC in place and
she continued on Lovenox twice per day.  Discharged on
[**2189-6-16**].
 * Required an admission on [**2189-6-19**] with pancytopenia,
[**Year (4 digits) 9140**] dyspnea, and increased creatinine.  Diureses and
underwent right thoracentesis.  Noted for C difficile infection
and treated with Flagyl which has been switched to Vancomycin.
 * Discharged on [**2189-7-2**] and saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23461**] [**Name (STitle) 3315**] from [**Company 2860**]
in consultation who recommended a dose adjusted CHOP regimen
given her age and other medical issues with usual dose of
Rituxan.
 * Required admission again on [**2189-7-9**] with weakness and
increased dyspnea requiring oxygen support.  Transferred to
Cardiology for [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] peripheral edema and dyspnea.  Started
on a lasix drip and underwent aggressive electrolyte and fluid
management.  Switched to Torsemide.  After her fluid status was
optimized, transferred back to the Hematologic Malignancy
service for her chemotherapy.
 * Received dose adjusted CHOP on [**2189-7-18**](Cytoxan given at a
dose of 400 mg per meter squared, Adriamycin 25 milligrams per
meter squared, vincristine 2 mg(no dose reduction) and
prednisone 60 milligrams daily for 5 days).  Discharged on
[**2189-7-20**] with close follow up with the Heart failure clinic.
 * [**2189-7-24**], attempts were made to give Rituxan as outpatient.
Developed shortness of breath given large fluid volume. Dose
divided and she received 150 mg on [**2189-7-29**] and [**2189-7-31**].
 * [**2189-8-3**], admitted with acute dyspnea with a drop in her
oxygen saturation. Chest CTA without pulmonary embolus. Noted
for large pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Transferred again to Cardiology service for closer management of
her fluid status.  Cardiac catheterization done which revealed
full occlusion of her RCA stent and 70-80% stenosis of her LMCA
that had developed since the most recent angiogram.  No surgical
intervention was performed given her high risk; continued on her
aspirin.  Metoprolol has been held with low blood pressure but
restarted along with aspirin.  Right pleural effusion was again
tapped.
 * Third consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23462**] @ [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**2189-8-7**] who
agreed with the current plan.  Maintained on Oxygen and was
discharged on [**2189-8-8**].
 * [**2189-7-23**], admitted for her 2nd cycle of the dose adjusted
RCHOP.  Chemotherapy given on [**2189-8-19**] and Rituxan on [**2189-8-20**]
after her pleural effusion was again tapped and her fluid status
maximized with aggressive diuresis.  Repeat echocardiogram on
[**2189-8-14**] which showed an EF of ~ 30%.  Repeat upper extremity
ultrasound showed resolution of upper extremity thrombus and
Lovenox discontinued.  Discharged on [**2189-8-22**] and has been
receiving Neupogen daily.
