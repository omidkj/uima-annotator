Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76y/o M with h/o NSCLC, COPD, a fib, symptomatic bradycardia s/p
[**First Name3 (LF) 4448**] placement, h/o posterior fossa SAH in setting of
supratherapeutic INR presents with altered mental status at
rehab. Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 34519**] with hypotension, COPD
exacerbation, and RUL pneumonia, thought to be postobstructive
[**2-25**] lung Ca. During that admission, he had episodes of a fib
with RVR as well. He was given a 2-week course of levo/flagyl,
which he completed on [**2179-2-24**].
.
Per wife's report, pt was confused on the AM of admission. He
had visual hallucinations and had shaking tremors. She also says
that he told her that they were "keeping him locked up." Per the
nursing home, he was noted to be more confused the night prior
to admission, and accusing them of "practicing voodoo." No
fevers per nursing home report; wife states that he had no other
complaints.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was given vancomycin 1g x1, ceftriaxone 2g x1,
solumedrol 125mg x1, albuterol/atrovent nebs. Sats on admission
to ED 93% (?RA), 97% on 2L, then 95% on 4L 7 hours later. Was
noted to be more short of breath, using accessory muscles, and
was placed on BiPAP. Sats 99%, breathing improved. Was
subsequently intubated.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2-25**] head CT: hyperdensity adjacent to previously identified
calcified extra-axial lesion - may be tiny focus of hemorrhage
or calcification
.
[**2-25**] CXR: partial improvement in RUL PNA; known R hilar mass not
visualized
.
[**2-25**] CTA chest: no evidence of PE; main pulmonary A large (3.8cm
diameter) suggestive of pulm HTN; lg R hilar mass with
encasement of hilar structures including R pulm A and R main
bronchus, and smaller areas; no change in size/appearance since
[**2-10**]; in R hilum, at previous opacity area, has developed
air-filled cavity with surrounding opacity - 2.1x1.7cm; [**Month/Year (2) **] has
completely collapsed, interval progression of patchy/nodular
opacities with area of confluence anteriorly; severe
emphysematous changes; small effusion surrounding [**Month/Year (2) **] collapse

Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with sob, active lung ca, chronic
postobstructive pneumonia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pls evaluate for PE in setting of malignancy and hypoxia and
characterization of pneumonia
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Shortness of breath and active lung cancer with
post-obstructive pneumonia. Please evaluate for PE in the
setting of malignancy and hypoxia.

COMPARISON: [**2179-2-10**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the chest were
obtained without contrast. Subsequently, following the
administration of 100 cc of Optiray, contiguous axial images
through the chest were obtained during opacification of the
pulmonary artery. Coronal, sagittal, and oblique reformatted
images were obtained.

CTA OF THE CHEST: There are no filling defects within the
pulmonary arterial branches to suggest a pulmonary embolus. The
main pulmonary artery is large, measuring 3.8 cm in diameter,
suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension. The thoracic aorta
is of normal caliber. Atherosclerotic changes of the aorta have
a similar appearance to [**2-10**]. The patient is post CABG.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Left-sided [**Month (only) 4448**] with single
lead in the right ventricle is unchanged. The patient has been
reintubated. A nasogastric tube is in place. Again noted is a
large right hilar mass with encasement of hilar structures
including the right pulmonary artery and right main bronchus in
addition to smaller airways. Size and appearance is not
significantly changed from [**2-10**]. In the right hilum at
an area of previous opacity with tiny air bubbles on the [**2-10**] study, there has developed an air-filled cavity with
surrounding opacity measuring 2.1 x 1.7 cm as seen on the
coronal images (series 688B, image 23). Since [**2-10**], the
right lower lobe has completely collapsed. There has been
significant interval progression of both patchy and nodular
opacities within the right middle lobe, with an area of relative
confluence anteriorly. Patchy and interstitial opacities within
the right upper lobe have worsened as well. Severe emphysematous
changes are again noted. In contrast to the right lung, the left
lung is relatively clear. There is a small effusion surrounding
right lower lobe collapse. Small mediastinal lymph nodes are
unchanged in the interim. No left pleural effusion or
pericardial effusion.

Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the noncontrast
enhanced visualized portions of the liver, gallbladder, spleen,
right adrenal gland, and superior kidney are unremarkable. An NG
tube is seen within the stomach, with the tip oriented cephalad.
There are heavy calcifications of the splenic artery.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic
lesions.

Multiplanar reformatted images were essential in delineating the
anatomy and pathology in this case (grade 3).

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval collapse of the right lower lobe.
3. Large right hilar mass encasing the right pulmonary artery
and the airway is relatively unchanged compared to [**2179-1-24**].
4. Soft tissue density containing air bubbles of the right hilum
has become an air-filled cavity at the right hilum with
surrounded soft tissue on today's exam.
5. Interval worsening of patchy nodular opacities of the right
upper and middle lobes, consistent with an infectious process.
Left lung remains clear.
6. Small right pleural effusion.
