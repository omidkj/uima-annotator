History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year-old male with a history of DM, HTN, CHF (EF
45%), CAD s/p CABG, PAD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **], a-fib, HL who presents with
hypoglycemia.  The patient was in his usual state of health
until this evening when he was noted to confused and altered by
his wife.  EMS was called and performed a fingerstick and
glucose was noted to be 26 and he was given 1 amp of D50 and
improved to 109.

In the ED, VS 98.2 72 140/62 16 96% 2L NC. Pt glucose on arrive
was 41 and was given his second amp of D50 and improved to 112.
He was rechecked in one hour and glucose was again low at 49.
He was then given his 3rd amp of D50, Octreotide 50ucg x1 and
started on a D5 gtt.  He was given a total of 400cc NS and 1L
D5NS.  The patient was also evaluated by toxicology who agreed
with the above management.  Her lactate was normal at 1.5.  He
was admitted to the ICU for close glucose monitoring.

CXR PA AND LATERAL [**2135-1-2**]:
Overall findings favor a diffuse pulmonary edema likely from
cardiogenic etiology. Slightly more confluent opacities may
simply reflect confluent edema or represent underlying
infiltrate or aspiration. Repeat radiography after appropriate
diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.

CXR PORTABLE [**2135-1-3**]:
In comparison with the study of [**1-2**], there is minimal decrease
in
the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with
congestive failure in a patient with cardiomegaly and evidence
of prior CABG procedure. The possibility of supervening
consolidation, especially at the left base, can certainly not be
excluded on this study.

ECHO [**2134-10-22**]: All [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] enlarged. Mild AR, Mild to Moderate
MR, Moderate TR. Severe pulmonary hypertension. LVEF 40-45%.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 year-old male with hypoglycemia [**1-12**] use of sulfonylureas at a
dose higher than he currently needs either because he is
inadvertently taking too much glyburide or he now requires a
lower dose.  The patient is unable to state which medications he
takes, so it is very likely that he is not using his home
medications properly.  He has not taken his Lasix at home for a
few weeks because he ran out. This explains in part why he has
crackles on physical exam and changes consistent with pulmonary
[**Month/Day (2) 1106**] congestion on CXR.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: Patient was initially on a dextrose infusion, but
this is now weaned off.  The patient is eating regular food by
mouth and his fingerstick blood sugars have been in the normal
range.  The patient was also treated with 2 doses of IV Lasix
for clinical and radiographic evidence of volume overload.

PROBLEM LIST:

# DM, type II with Hypoglycemia: Patient was noted to have be
confused this evening and glucose was noted to be 29 by EMS. He
has subsequently received D50 amps x3, octreotide 50ucg x1
(suppresses endogenous insulin production) and D5 gtt. The most
likely etiology is glyburide overdose, but the patient does not
recall taking extra medications. Other possibility is glyburide
in elderly with declining kidnet function can cause
hypoglycemia.  Other causes seem less likely including alcohol,
sepsis/infection, cortisol deficiency and even less likely
insulinoma or insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia. Metformin does
not cause hypglycemia and lactate is normal. He was closely
monitored with regular fingersticks and required several
treatments with D50. For a brief period, the patient was on a
dextrose infusion. Cortisol was 17.4 which is not consistent
with adrenal insufficiency. HbA1C was 6.3%.
- Hold Glyburide unless hyperglycemic (given that A1c is
6.3%,this was discontinued altogether. Would likely benefit from
ACE inhibitor, but will not start at this time given
hyperkalemia, this can be started as an outpatient if
electrolyties within normal limits.

# Systolic heart failure, EF 45%, mild exacerbation likely [**1-12**]
lasix non-compliance and dextrose infusion.  Exam with crackles.
Per patient stopped taking furosemide past month. Improving with
Lasix 20mg IV x2. Restarted home Lasix 20mg PO Daily
