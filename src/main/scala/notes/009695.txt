History of Present Illness:
80 y/o male w/known CAD, adm. to [**Hospital3 35813**] Center for

Physical Exam:
unremarkable upon admission

Pertinent Results:
[**10-27**] CNIS: There is a less than 40% right ICA stenosis and a
less than 40 left ICA stenosis with antegrade flow in both
vertebral arteries.
[**10-27**] Vein Mapping: Bilaterally patent greater saphenous veins,
with the patient standing, the above-mentioned diameters are
noted.
[**10-28**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. 2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild to moderate hypokinesis of the mid anterior,
antero-septal and antero-lateral walls and dyskinesis of the
anterior and antero-septal apex. 3. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. 4. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the
descending aorta. 5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. 7. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. 8. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. 9. There
is no pericardial effusion. POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass
study, the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions including
phenylephrine. 1. LV function is slightly improved. The area of
dyskinesis in the antero-septal and anterior apex are resolved.
RV function is [**Month/Day (4) 1506**]. 2. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**] 3. Aorta is itnact
post-decannulation 4. Other findings are [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**]
[**10-31**] CXR: Status post CABG. A single AP view of the chest is
obtained [**2173-10-31**] at 05:10 hours and compared with the prior
morning's radiograph. The left pleural tube has been removed.
The tiny left apical pneumothorax seen yesterday has almost
completely resolved. There persists increased density in the
retrocardiac area on the left side consistent with
atelectasis/airspace disease. The patient is developing some
patchy densities at the right base, which also likely represent
atelectasis or possibly early airspace disease. No large pleural
effusions are present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred from [**Hospital3 35813**] Center to the CVICU on
[**2173-10-27**].  Taken to the OR on [**2173-10-28**] for CABG X 4 (LIMA>LAD,
SVG>Diag, SVG>OM, SVG>RCA).  Please see operative report for
details.  Post-operatively, he was taken to the CVICU.  He was
initially slow to wake from anesthesia, and extubated on POD #
1.  He was weaned from vasoactive drips, and transferred to the
telemetry unit later that day.  He had some delerium at night
for the first few nights, but this has cleared without
intervention.  He discontinued his left pleural chest tube, and
subsequent CXR revealed no pneumothorax.  He remained stable
hemodynamically, and his antihypertensive medications were
increased over the next few days.  He did fail two voiding
trials after Foley removal, and will be discharged with a Foley
catheter.  He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63370**], a urologist
at [**Hospital3 35813**] Center in [**State 792**]as determined by his
PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
