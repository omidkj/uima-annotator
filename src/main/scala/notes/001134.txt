Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. A
catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the
RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). No resting LVOT
gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Mildly dilated RV cavity. RV
function depressed. Abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with RV pressure overload.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR). MVR
well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal
tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Mild to moderate
[[**2-11**]+] TR. Severe PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for
PDA
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 65%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A
bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. There is severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital after presenting with
increased edema and shortness of breath for re evaluation for
surgical intervention.  She was on heparin for atrial
fibrillation and underwent preoperative evaluation.  Hepatology
was consulted, she had abdominal ultrasound that revealed normal
liver and spleen, and she was cleared for surgery.  Additional
preoperative workup included dental, pulmonary function test and
echocardiogram.  She had discomfort at her catheterization site
and had vascular ultrasound that revealed no hematoma or
pseudoaneurysm.  She was brought to the operating room on [**7-25**]
for surgery however due to increased tenderness at the
catheterization site her surgery was cancelled and she was
started on ancef for potential cellulitis.  Vascular surgery was
consulted and felt there was no evidence of infection or
vascular issues.  However her creatinine increased to 1.6, her
ace inhibitor and lasix were stopped and the ancef was
discontinued.  Additionally her digoxin was stopped due to
increased creatinine and bradycardia. Over the next few days her
creatinine trended down to baseline  1.1-1.3. She developed
diarrhea which resolved within twenty four hours with WBC
remaining normal.

On [**2114-7-30**] she was brought to the operating room and underwent
mitral valve replacement.  See operative report for further
details.  She received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics
and was transferred to the intensive care unit for post
operative management.  That evening, she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated without
complications.  However later she was noted to have increasing
pulmonary and systolic pressures with no response to milirone,
nipride, and nicardipine. Her medications were adjusted and on
post operative day one she was started on diuretics, ace
inhibitor, and beta blocker.  On post operative day two her
pulmonary catheter was removed and she remained in the intensive
care unit for hemodynamic management.  Her epicardial wires and
chest tubes were removed per protocol.  She continued to have
betablockers adjusted for heart rate management and lasix for
diuresis.  Additionally she was treated for hyponatremia with
free water restriction and sodium tablets.  She was restarted on
coumadin for atrial fibrillation and then on post operative day
four was transferred to the floor for the remainder of her care.
 Physical therapy worked with her on strength and mobility.  On
post operative day eight she was ready for discharge to rehab -
