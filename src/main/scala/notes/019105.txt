History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is 55 year old man with CHF (EF 25%) and multiple
prior hospitalizations for decompensated heart failure, AFIB,
CAD w/ MI in [**2132**],  CABG in [**2140**], mitral valve repair in [**2142**],
3rd redo sternotomy in [**2148-4-26**] for tricuspid valvuloplasty,
mitral valve replacement and biatrial maze procedure, now
directly admitted from Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] office for repeat CHF
exacerbation.

Pt was in his usual state of health until ~ 1 wk ago when he
started feel "bloated and filling up with fluid." Pt states that
he has been very careful about his diet and especially his
sodium intake. He has mildly increased shortness of breath and a
dry cough. He also has fatigue and back pain that he attributes
to his weight gain. He weighs himself daily and reports gaining
at least 10 extra pounds, including 3 pounds yesterday.

Pt was recently on vacation in [**State 1727**], and denies sick contacts
or unusual exposures. He denies fever, chills, or changes in
appetite. He has not had any chest pain, palpitations, nausea or
vomiting, headaches, diarrhea, constipation, or urinary
problems.

Pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2148-8-13**] after
treatment for CHF exacerbation during which Pt was diuresed ~ 9
L w/ a furosemide iv drip titrated up to 30mg /hr and 3-4L urine
output daily. Pt was underwent plasmapheresis ~2 wks prior but
had to stop early due to lightheadedness. Pt believes this
contributed to his weight-gain.

In clinic, Pt's vitals were BP 128/72, HR 62, weighed 201 lbs,
and Pt was directly admitted to [**Hospital1 18**].

Upon transfer to the floor, Pt was stable w/ little shortness of

ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# Acute on chronic CHF - Pt's weight on admission 90kg (weight
on previous discharge 84.8kg). Furosemide increased to 100mg PO
bid, and he started metolozone at 5mg daily. Briefly added
losartan 25mg po daily but Cr bumped to 2.8 and this was
discontinued. Dialysis arranged in [**Hospital 10874**] Clinic w/ [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. On HD8, patient was transferred to the CCU for milrinone
drip to assist with diuresis. He diuresed well with milrinone
and torsemide.  At the time of discharge he had diuresed a total
of 3.5L and his weight was 86kg.  On discharge, all of his home
medications and doses were resumed, with the exception of
carvedilol which was decreased to 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].  He was not
restarted on losartan due to his worsening renal failure (see
below). He was scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in clinic 2
days after discharge.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Creat elevated on admission
to 2.8 (was 1.9 on prior hospital discharge), and continued to
increase to 4.0. He had recently started losartan, which was
discontinued. The patient's creatinine improved with initiation
of milrinone.  It trended downward and was 2.4 at the time of
discharge.
.
# Hypokalemia: Patient was hypokalemic with ongoing diuresis.
He was repleted
