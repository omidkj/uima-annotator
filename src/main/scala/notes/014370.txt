Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH, intubated, for evaluation of severe pneumonia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Ventilation and Endotracheal Intubation
Tracheostomy
PEG placement
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 83369**] is a 77 year old man with no significant past medical
history who presented to an outside hospital on [**5-11**] for
evaluation of shortness of breath and cough. Per the OSH
records, he initially developed a cold-like illness, which he
described as weakness, chest congestion, and a cough productive
of yellow sputum. When his symptoms progressed, along with
headache and an episode of nausea/vomiting, he sought medical
attention. His vitals on arrival to the OSH were T 104.1F, BP
110/60, and O2 sat 86% on room air. His initial labs were
notable for WBC 13.5K and CXR demonstrated extensive left-sided
pneumonia. He received 1g ceftriaxone and 500mg azithromycin,
but soon developed tachycardia to 130's and was transferred to
the CCU. Rapid influenza A and B testing was negative.
Full hospital course is difficult to determine given
illegibility of notes. He was intubated for worsening hypoxemia
on [**5-13**]. Multiple consulting services, including infectious
disease, cardiology, and neurology were involved. He developed a
tachycardia (per the family, > 170 bpm) after which he was
intubated. He was on antibiotics throughout his OSH course,
including ceftriaxone, levofloxacin (switched from
azithromycin), gentamicin, and doxycycline (given some concern
over tick-borne illness). Neurology was apparently involved for
altered mental status/encephalopathy.

Of note, his brother had recently returned from the Southwest,
and he also was diagnosed with pneumonia.

[**5-13**] CT chest, abdomen, pelvis: No evidence of pulmonary
embolism. Left upper lobe pneumonia; bibasilar atelectasis.
Mildly dilated small bowel loops, partial small bowel
obstruction versus ileus. Moderate-severe (50-69%) of the
proximal left renal artery, may be further examined with a
dedicated CT angiographic scan.
[**5-13**] CXR: Worsening left-sided pulmonary parenchymal
infiltrates.
[**5-13**] Echo: Tachycardia. Overal normall left ventricular function
with an estimated ejection fraction of 55%. Normal right
ventricular function. Trace tricuspid regurgitation.
[**5-14**] CXR: The opacification of the upper [**1-29**] of the left lung is
unchanged. NG tube and endotracheal tube remain in good AP
positions. The heart size is unchanged.
[**5-15**] CXR: Interval entire opacification of the left hemithorax
is seen consistent with worsening.
[**5-15**] CXR: Interval mild improvement of the diffuse left lung
infiltrate. Infiltrate in the right mid lung and right lower
lung however is seen. The heart size is unchanged. Endotracheal
tube remains in good position.
[**5-16**] Fluoroscopy: Fluoroscopy is provided for the purposes of
bronchoscopy.
[**5-16**] CXR: No evidence of pneumothorax. There is somewhat
increased opacification of the left hemithroax, although, there
has not been an optimal inspiration. ET and NG tubes appear in
good position.
[**5-16**] CXR: Diffuse opacification of the left lung and infiltrate
in the right lung are unchaged. NG tube and ET tube remain in
good position.
[**5-17**] CXR (CVL placement): Successful ultrasound guided PICC line
placement. Catheter is ready for use immediately.
[**5-17**] CXR: No interval change.
[**5-17**] CXR: No interval change.
[**5-18**] CXR: No evidence of pneumothorax or significant change.
[**5-19**] CT Head: No intracranial abnormalities seen.
[**5-19**] CXR: Interval worsening of bilateral lower lobe
infiltrates. Mild improvement of left upper lobe severe
infiltrate.
[**5-19**] CXR: No interval change is seen.
[**5-21**] CXR: As compared to yesterday's exam, there has been no
significant interval change.
Cytology report (bronch): Negative for malignant cells.

RADIOLOGY:
CT chest [**5-22**]:  Multifocal bilateral pneumonia with partly
consolidated and partly non-consolidated lung areas. Extensive
air bronchograms and areas of bronchiectasis, suggesting chronic
or recurrent infection. Moderate left- sided pleural effusion.
Borderline size of mediastinal lymph nodes, punctate parenchymal
and left hilar lymph node calcifications. Endotracheal tube and
nasogastric tubes in situ.
.
ECHO [**2143-5-24**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
