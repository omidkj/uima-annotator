Brief Hospital Course:
.
1) CAD: The patient was admitted with an inferior STEMI, found
to involve the RV.  Cardiac catheterization showed total
occlusion of the RCA, which was stented with a Cypher DES.  The
LCx was found to be 80% stenosed, which stented in a planned
intervention on [**8-3**].  He received integrillin x 18 hours.  He
was also started on aspirin, Plavix, high-dose statin, and beta
blocker.  An ACE-I not started during this admission because of
hypotension.  His cardiac enzymes trended down throughout the
admission.  TTE on [**8-3**] showed regional LV and RV hypokinesis,
with EF of 40-45%.  Lipid panel showed LDL of 123.  He was
instructed to f/u with his PCP and cardiologist in [**Hospital1 487**], MA.
.
2) Hypotension:  Patient required dopamine hours after cath for
low blood pressure.  Given his levated CVP with hypotension, he
was presumed to have RV involvement.  He was maintained on IVF
post-catheterization.  Dopamine gtt was weaned overnight on
[**7-31**].  He continued to be hemodynamically stable throughout rest
of hospitalization.
.
3) Asthma: Mr. [**Known lastname 63776**] has an outpatient diagnosis of
asthma.  He was continued on his outpatient inhalers and had no
complaints throughout his admission.  He maintained good O2 sats
throughout his stay.
.
4) FEN: IVF, Mg and Phos repletion.  He was maintained on a
cardiac diet.
.
