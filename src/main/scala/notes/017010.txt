Brief Hospital Course:
81 year-old male with a history of CML who presented to clinic
with rigors, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis and acute on
chronic renal failure.  Admitted for workup and became acutely
agitated in CT.  Received iv ativan x1 and became unresponsive.
He was treated with insulin, D50, and kayexylate. He was also
treated for his pneumonia. His altered mental status cleared. We
felt his hyperkalemia may have been due to acute renal failure,
allthough despite fluid challenge to the point of oxygen
requirement, his creatinine had been slow to improve.

He had an abnomrmal blood gas, which was consistent with a
respiratory alkalosis and a metabolic acidosis. In addition to a
urinary anion gap that was posative @ 40, we flt this consistent
with an RTA, possible type 4 RTA, which also could have
contributed to his hyperkalemia. The etiolody of the RTA remains
unclear, but he is currently being treated with bicarbonate
supplements as we feel this will decrease his work of breathing.
 Pt. was discharged with bicarbonate supplements and had
outpatient renal follow up.

Altered Mental Status:  Concern for infectious process given
fever to 102.5, received cefepime in ED.  Cultures send,
received cefepime in clinic.  UA negative.  Fever curve
gradually decreased during stay and WBC was at 6.5 on discharge.


# Hyperkalemia:  Unclear cause, not an issue during floor stay.

# Non Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: diarrhea, type 1, 2, 4 RTA,
approached as stated above, sent home with renal follow up.

# CLL:  On desatinib, followed here by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**].  Was held
during his stayin the the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and was restarted once back on
the oncology floor.  Was discharged with follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 410**] 2 days post discharge.

# CAD s/p CABG [**2114**] (LBBB on previous EKG): No active issues.

# Chronic Diasolic heart failure. (EF 50%): No active issues.
