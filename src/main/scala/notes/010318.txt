Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M

Service: Neurosurgery


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 27-year-old man who
developed a generalized seizure, less than 2 minutes,
followed by a frontal headache.  He was admitted to [**Hospital6 52666**] Center complaining of nausea and vomiting and
positive neck pain with diaphoresis.  Blood pressure on
arrival to [**Hospital6 22197**] Center was 197/118, heart rate
114, and temperature 98.3 degrees.  He was in atrial
fibrillation.  He converted to sinus rhythm with Cardizem.
The patient received Ativan and Dilantin IV push and
nimodipine.  His CT at the outside hospital showed diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage with blood in the fourth ventricle
and hydrocephalus.  On [**2108-2-4**], he was transferred to [**Hospital 14852**] Neuro SICU, where blood pressure was
maintained at less than 130 on Nipride and angiography found
a [**Doctor Last Name **] aneurysm at the proximal left PCA, about 3 mm in
size.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2108-2-5**] for possible coiling.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  None at home.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Two beers per day.  The patient had a
paternal grandfather who passed away approximately 2 years
prior with a ruptured aneurysm.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.4 degrees, pulse 60,
blood pressure 131/61 on Nipride, respiratory rate 15, and
saturation 95 percent on room air.  He appeared in no acute
distress.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  He had a regular
rate and rhythm; S1, S2, systolic; grade 2 systolic murmur.
His abdomen was soft, nontender.  His cranial nerves II
through XII were intact bilaterally.  Pupils were 3 mm to 2
mm bilaterally.  Motor, no pronator drift.  Motor strength
was [**6-6**] in all extremities.  Sensory was grossly intact.
Reflexes were 2 plus throughout.  Finger-to-nose was also
intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**],
Neurosurgery Service for an angiography with possible
coiling.  He was placed on every 1 hour on neuro checks,
nimodipine 60 mg every 4 hours.  Systolic blood pressure was
kept less than 130 using Nipride.  He was on Dilantin,
Protonix, Colace, and Senna for prophylaxis.  He was kept NPO
and was given an IV of normal saline at 75 cc an hour.  He
received Decadron 4 mg every 6 hours.  His INR was kept less
than 1.3 and was given morphine for pain.  The patient
underwent a cerebral angiogram on [**2108-2-5**].  On [**2108-2-5**], he
went to the Neuroangiography Suite where he was found to have
a 2.5- to 3-mm basilar trunk aneurysm located between the left
posterior cerebral artery and the superior cerebellar artery,
status post GDC coiling embolization via endovascular
approach with GDC coils.  The procedure was without
complications; the procedure was completed at approximately
2230 hours.

On [**2108-2-6**], it was noted at 1.30 in the morning that the
patient became agitated and his O2 saturations were in 80
percent range.  Blood pressure was 160/80, pulse 53, and
temperature 97.8.  He was moving all extremities.  He
immediately was intubated and sedated.  An EKG was within
normal limits.  Chest x-ray showed no collapse, slight fluid
overload.  CT of his head was done and a CTA was completed to
rule out a PE.  Despite the rapid intubation he sustained an
episode of severe hypoxemia with a pO2 in the 50's range which
did not rapdily respond to ventilation.   His cardiac enzymes
were all negative. Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema.  CT of the
head showed dilated ventricles with no new blood.  In light of
his chest x-ray findings and new mental status changes, decision
was made to obtain a chest CT without contrast.  CT of the chest
finding was consistent with pulmonry edema. The patient had an
immediate central line with Swan-Ganz catheter placed for
hemodynamic monitoring.  He also had a ventriculostomy drain
placed without complications.

On [**2108-2-6**] in the morning on rounds, the patient's
temperature was 99.3, heart rate 53, blood pressure 144/54,
and respirations 12.  Gas 7.44, 33, 178, 23, 0.  White count
was 16.7, hematocrit 36.3, and platelets 215.  Troponin was
less than 0.01 and MB was 1.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.7,
chloride 109, 23 for bicarbonate, 8 for BUN, and 0.6 for
creatinine.  His pupils were 1.5 mm and trace reactive
bilaterally.  He localized on his upper extremities.  He
withdrew his lower extremities.  The drain was kept at 12
above the tragus.  His blood pressure was kept less than 150.
PCO2 was kept 35-40, and he had an MRI later on [**2108-2-6**],
which showed increased diffusion present in the globus
pallidus region bilaterally in both caudate nuclei, the right
and left posterolateral thalamus and medial temporal bones on
both sides demonstrating increased diffusion.  These
findings were felt to be consistent with global anoxic
episode.  Blood was present in the lateral ventricles.  There was
a drainage catheter.  The ventriculostomy drain was in place.

At 5 p.m. on [**2108-2-6**], he had a diagnostic cerebral
angiogram, which showed no evidence of significant change in
the appearance of the treated aneurysm with no
recanalization or regrowth and no evidence of thrombotic
involvement in the basilar arteries or its branches.
Postoperative check at approximately 7:45 on [**2108-2-6**] showed
that he still had no response to voice.  Pupils bilaterally
were equal and reactive.  He seemed to localize briskly
better on his left upper extremity than his right.  An EEG
showed encephalopathy with some burst suppression.  He was
kept off sedatives at that time.  Neurology also saw the
patient on [**2108-2-6**] and recommended an infectious workup, a
TTE to look for LV dysfunction and wall motion abnormalities.
They recommended to continue to cycle his cardiac enzymes and
to repeat his DWI in 24 hours to look for any anoxic injury.
Neurology felt that the coma was secondary to diffuse
cortical hemispheric insult.  At the time of examination,
brainstem reflexes were largely intact and thus it was likely
that the coma was due to diffuse cortical dysfunction;
however, the extent of cerebral edema, tight cisterns made
herniation in the brainstem dysfunction a possibility.  They
recommended if it should worsen or his ventricular drain
should fail, that the cause that his diffuse cortical injury
most likely was anoxic in nature since the symptoms acutely
followed a hypoxic event.  Another thought was that the
patient suffered from alcohol abuse and perhaps that a
Wernicke encephalopathy was possible.  They also recommended
a close ICP monitoring as already was being done and optimal
cerebral perfusion with systolic blood pressure greater than
140, head of bed at 30 degrees, and calcium channel agonist
to prophylax against vasospasm, which had already been
started.

On [**2108-2-7**], his T-max was 100.7, pulse was 72, blood
pressure 169/76, PA pressure 42/20, and wedge pressure 15.
He was receiving Nipride and propofol.  He was on assist
control.  He would open his eyes to stimulation.  His pupils
were 1.5 mm and trace reactive.  He localized briskly
bilateral upper extremities and withdrew bilaterally in his
lower extremities.  His blood pressure was kept less than 150
using labetalol and Nipride as needed.  PCO2 was kept 35-40.
The drain was at 10 cm of water.  He was receiving mannitol
15 mg IV every 4 hours.  His total IV fluids were kept at 100
cc an hour.  His serum osmols and sodium and arterial gases
were monitored closely.  On [**2108-2-7**], he had a repeat head
CT, which showed interval loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter
differentiation in the cerebrum.  In the interval since the
prior studies, the findings were consistent with anoxic brain
injury.  There was no interval change in the areas of
hypoattenuation within the globus pallidus bilaterally and no
interval change in the extent of the subarachnoid hemorrhage
blood within the lateral ventricles.

On [**2108-2-8**], T-max was 100.9, blood pressure 126/54, PAP
pressure 32/13, wedge of 8, and ICP was in the range 9-23.
He was
