History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 53yo G3P1 woman initially referred to GYN
Oncology for
consultation regarding possible adenocarcinoma in situ of the
cervix.  The patient had an AGUS Pap smear followed by cervical
biopsy and ECC in [**2196-6-12**] revealing atypical endocervical
cells.  She had no prior history of abnormal Pap smears or
cervical dysplasia.  On [**2196-11-14**], she underwent CO2 laser
conization of the cervix with final pathology demonstrating both
in situ and
microinvasive adenocarcinoma with the lateral extent of the
invasive component measuring 1.5 mm and deepest invasion 1.5 mm.

CT Chest [**2197-2-2**]:
1. Limited exam, but no large or definite pulmonary embolus
identified.
2. Interval development of multifocal bilateral patchy opacities
diffusely within the lungs, but greatest in the lung apices.
This may represent an infectious process versus pulmonary edema.
3. Small bilateral effusions and associated atelectasis.
4. Ascites fluid within the abdomen. There is a small amount of
free air visualized which likely relates to the postoperative
status of the patient.
5. Interval enlargement of precarinal lymph nodes.
6. Previously noted pulmonary nodules are unchanged. There are
other nodular opacities, but these may reflect the infectious
process or edema occurring at the current time.
7. Heterogeneous thyroid as previously described.
8. Fatty infiltration of the liver

CT Abd [**2197-2-2**]:
1. Patchy opacities in the visualized portions of the lung
bases. Please also see chest CTA of the same day showing patchy
opacities throughout the lungs concerning for penumonia.
2. Free fluid is seen throughout the abdomen and pelvis.
3. There is no evidence of focal fluid collections such as
abscesses.

CXR [**2197-2-4**]:  There is dense opacification involving both
lungs, somewhat more pronounced in the upper zones bilaterally.
Compared with earlier the same day, the infiltrates apear
slightly worse, even acocunting for considerable technical
differences betwene the two films. Differential diagnosis
includes pneumonic infiltrates, CHF and ARDS.  The heart is
minimally enlarged. No effusions are identified.

CXR [**2197-2-5**]: Heart size is at the upper limits of normal. There
are dense, somewhat patchy alveolar infiltrates throughout both
lungs, most pronounced in the upper zones. Allowing for
differences in technique, the findings are very similar to those
on the chest x-ray from one day earlier. Differential diagnosis
includes pneumonic infiltrate, CHF and ARDS. No effusion is
identified.

CXR [**2197-2-7**]: Improving alveolar infiltrates which represents
improving pneumonic infiltrate or CHF.

EKG [**2197-2-2**]: Normal sinus rhythm, without diagnostic
abnormality.
EKG [**2197-2-7**]: Sinus rhythm. Modest right ventricular conduction
delay - may be normal variant. Since previous tracing of
[**2197-2-2**], right ventricular conduction delay pattern present.

Urine cultures from [**2197-2-2**], [**2197-2-3**], [**2197-2-6**]: NO GROWTH.

Blood cultures from [**2197-2-2**], [**2197-2-3**], [**2197-2-4**], [**2197-2-6**]: NO

Sputum from [**2197-2-4**]: Gram stain, culture c/w OP flora; PCP

Legionella urinary antigen [**2197-2-2**]: Negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted to the gynecologic oncology service on
[**2197-1-30**] and underwent uncomplicated radical hysterectomy with
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, lymph node dissection, and
sacrocolpopexy with mesh.  Her postoperative course was notable
for the following issues:

1. Pulm: The pt had an episode of dyspnea and desaturation on
room air to 78% on POD#2.  She was ruled out for PE by CTA on
POD#[**3-17**], although she was shown to have a multifocal pneumonia.
Her oxygen requirement continued to increase until she was
requiring 6L via face mask to maintain adequate O2 saturation;
she was therefore transferred to the ICU for further monitoring
on POD#3.  She was called out on POD#4.  Her O2 sats continued
to fall, and on POD#5 she became dyspneic and had another
desaturation to 78% on room air; she was therefore transferred
back to the ICU.  She was gradually weaned off of O2 and was
called back out of the unit on POD#8.  Her O2 sats remained in
the mid- to high-90s on room air for the remainder of her stay.

2. ID: The pt spiked a fever on POD#[**3-17**], and a CTA showed a
multifocal pneumonia.  She was started on Levaquin for coverage
of a presumed community-acquired v. atypical pneumonia.  She
continued to spike temperatures in the ICU, and a CT of the
abdomen was obtained, which showed no abscesses or postoperative
fluid collections.  She continued to have fevers along with her
desaturations on the floor, and official ID consult was obtained
on POD#5; they recommended adding Vancomycin and Zosyn for more
broad coverage for her pneumonia.  Her Levaquin was D/C'd on
POD#6 in the ICU.  She completed a 7 day course of both the
Vancomycin and the Zosyn, and did not spike fevers again after
POD#8.  She was discharged home on no further antibiotics.

3. GU: The pt had low urine output on POD#[**2-14**].  A FeNa was
calculated at 0.45 on POD#3, consistent with intravascular fluid
depletion.  She was aggressively rehydrated with improvement
noted.  A Foley catheter was left in place for 9 days
postoperatively due to the extensive nature of the patient's
surgery.  Once she was ambulatory, it was D/C'd.  She received
Lasix for presumed CHF while in the ICU with appropriate
diuresis noted.  The pt's creatinine rose on POD#11, presumed
due to the nephrotoxicity of the IV contrast she had received,
as well as the Vancomycin.  It remained stable on POD#12 after
the Vanco was D/C'd.

4. CV: The pt was ruled out with enzymes for postoperative MI as
a potential etiology for her desaturations on POD#[**3-17**].  She
never had chest pain.

5. Heme: The pt had baseline anemia with a Hct of ~27 as an
outpt, etiology unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] Hct fell to 24 postoperatively.
She was never symptomatically anemic.  Her Hct rose to 27 during
the course of her hospital stay.  She never required blood
transfusions.
