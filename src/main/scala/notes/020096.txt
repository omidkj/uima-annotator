History of Present Illness:
This 76 year old male underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
in [**2090**]. He called his cardiologist few days ago and stated that
he was having increased shortness of breath. A TTE revealed
severe aortic stenosis and he was referred for cardiac
catheterization to evaluate aortic stenosis and for current
coronary status. His catheterization confirmed severe aortic
stenosis and 70% lesion of his LAD.

Pertinent Results:
[**2112-4-5**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities in the mid and
apical lateral wall.. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF=45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before surgical
incision.

Post_Bypass:
Normal RV systolic function.
LVEF 45%. No new regional wall motion abnormalities.
The aortic bioprosthesis is stable and functioning well with a
residual mean gradient of 2 mm of Hg

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2112-4-5**] for surgical
management of his aortic valve disease. He was taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent  redo sternotomy with
replacement of his aortic valve with a 27-mm St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4041**]
tissue valve. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated.

That day he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The Physical Therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility.

Beta blockade was begun.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed per protocols and
he progressed. He was cleared for home discharge. Coumadin for
his chronic atrial fibrillation was resumed and will continue to
be managed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as preoperatively. All follow up
appointments were arranged, wounds were clean and healing well
at discharge.
