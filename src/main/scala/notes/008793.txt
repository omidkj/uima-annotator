Brief Hospital Course:
# Pulm: likely primary pulmonary process with some componenent
of CHF (pleural effusions). Unclear etiology of underlying pulm
dz as never smoked.  Pt diuresed gently with lasix for overload.
Resp status stabilized with standing Albuterol, Atrovent, as
well as prednisone taper. By echocardiogram, pt with severe
pulmonary artery hypertension and right-sided heart overload
suggestive of primary pulmonary process. Pt's CXR with slight
hyperinflation and small pleural effusions but otherwise
unremarkable. Pt's respiratory status was stable throughout
hospital stay with minimal oxygen requirement via NC. Pulmonary
was consulted & recommended outpt workup for causes of pulm
artery hypertension, including chronic pulm emboli. Given pt's
clinical stability & desire for d/c, pt was discharged to rehab
and furhter outpt w/u was arranged, including echocardiogram
with bubble study, CXR, V/Q scan, PFTs, and pulmonology clinic.

# R-ventricle overload: likely due to primary pulmonary process.
Diuresed with good effect. Will d/c on lasix 20 mg PO qod.
Monitor electrolytes closely.

# Acid-Base: bicarb was elevated. Pt likely a CO2 retainer and
also likely contraction alkalosis fr diuresis. Bicarb improved
as we decreased diuresis.

# Psych: per family, has been intermittently confused x many
months now. Also recent psych admission for depression. Here
redirectable, esp with help of family. Vit B12, folate, RPR all
WNL. Continued on Paxil and Aricept.

# Bradycardia: cards thought due over-beta-blocked so beta
blocker was discontinued. Pt's heart rate remained stable in
60-70s throughout remainder of hospital stay.

# Code Status: after pt & family discussion, CPR and meds okay,
but no intubation or defibrillation.
