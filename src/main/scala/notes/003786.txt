Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2182-1-24**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 104620**] is an 89 yo M with HTN, HLD, DMII, moderate AS (valve
area 1.0 cm^2) and CKD who presented with worsening chest pain,
and admitted for elective cardiac cath. Please see Dr. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 104621**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 196**] admission note for full details. In brief,
patient noted worsening exertional chest discomfort over the
past few months, with decreased exercise tolerance (unable to
walk ?????? mile without chest pain, and less resolution with rest).
He had a TTE with mildly depressed EF (50%) in [**6-26**], and an
exercise stress test showing a mild, fixed inferior wall defect
and global mild hypokinesis with a calculated left ventricular
ejection fraction is 46 %. As a result of his symptoms and the
above test results, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2182-1-23**] for
pre-cath hydration prior to elective cardiac catherization.
.
In the cath lab today, patient received total fentanyl 82.5 mg
IV and midazolam 2 mg IV. Right and left heart cardiac
catherization was performed. Left heart cath revealed 2VD, with
a heavily calcified LAD 80% proximal, 90% serial mid, and 70%
distal disease, LCx 40% proximal stenosis and a 60% stenosis of
the ramus, and moderate aortic stenosis. Right heart cath
revealed both elevated left and right sided pressures. Rotablade
was performed on the LAD (2 more proximal lesions followed by
angioplasty). However, at that point, patient became confused,
stated his back was hurting and tried to move off of the cath
table despite requests to stay down, and contaminated the groin
site with his hand. At that point, the cardiac catherization was
stopped (no intervention on the distal lesion). He received 10
mg IV haldol total and 20 mg IV lasix, while in the cath lab.
Urine output unable to be measured due to condom cath being
pulled off by patient. An angioseal was placed for arterial
closure. He was started on integrillin and transferred to the
CCU for closer monitering.
.
In the CCU, he continued to be confused, and attempted to sit up
in bed despite having a venous sheath, and pull on his lines. He
received an extra 5 mg of IV haldol and was placed in 4 point
wrist restraints. He was able to follow most commands, but
unable to answer any review of systems.

IMAGING/PROCEDURES:
====================
CARDIAC CATH [**2182-1-24**]:
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated two
vessel disease. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
disease. The
LAD was diffusely calcified with a proximal 80% stenosis, 90%
mid
stenosis, and 70% distal stenosis. The LCx had a 40% proximal
stenosis
and a 60% stenosis of the ramus. The RCA was nondominant and had
no
angiographically apparent disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 18mmHg and LVEDP 21mmHg. There was moderate
pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 61mmHg. The cardiac
index was
preserved at 2.33 L/min/m2. The SVR was normal at 1300
dynes-sec/cm5.
The systemic arterial blood pressure was normal with SBP 132mmHg
and DBP
63mmHg.
3. There was moderate aortic stenosis with valve area of 1.0cm2
with
mean gradient of 24.3mmHg.
4. Successful rotational atherectomy (1.5mm burr) and PTCA
(2.5mm
balloon) of the proximal and mid LAD.
5. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with
a 6F
Angioseal device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Serial LAD stenoses.
3. Moderate aortic stenosis.
4. Successful atherectomy and PTCA of the proximal and mid LAD.
.
CXR [**2182-1-26**]:The heart size is moderately enlarged, similar
compared to prior, and there are bilateral pleural effusions
with volume loss in both lower lobes. There is pulmonary
vascular re-distribution, but there is less
perihilar haze compared to prior. There is volume
loss/infiltrate in both
lower lobes.
IMPRESSION: Continued but slightly improved CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo M with multiple CAD risk factors admitted for elective
cardiac cath for symptoms of unstable angina and mild systolic
dysfunction on TTE, found to have 2 vessel disease(including
severe LAD disease) and moderate aortic stenosis.
.
# CORONARIES:  The patient has multiple risk factors for CAD
including HTN, HLD, DM, CKD. He was directly admitted for
cardiac catheterization because of a reversible defect seen on
stress testing.  Cardiac catheterization showed 3 tight LAD
lesions and a 40% LCx stenosis.  Only 2 of 3 LAD lesions were
intervened on, wh
