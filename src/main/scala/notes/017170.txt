artery stenosis and stenting along with cholangitis who is
presenting again from a rehabilitation facility with

The patient herself does not have any specific complaints.
She denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
fevers or chills.  She denies any headache.  She denies any
bright red blood per rectum or melena.  She denies any chest
pain or shortness of breath.  The patient's other liver

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.9, blood
pressure 134/90, pulse 86, respiratory rate 16, oxygen
saturation 98% on trach mask with 40% oxygen.  In general,
the patient is somnolent but easily arousable and answers
questions appropriately.  She is alert and oriented times
three.  HEENT examination shows bilateral medial rectus
muscle palsy.  The pupils are constricted.  Sclerae are
anicteric.  Moist mucus membranes.  Neck examination shows a
trach with no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Chest is clear with the exception of basilar rales.
Cardiovascular examination shows a regular rate and rhythm
with normal S1, S2.  3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left
sternal border.  Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender,
non-distended with normoactive bowel sounds.  There is an
area of ongoing wound healing at the superior portion of a
surgical wound.  This area is clean, dry and intact without
any exudate or surrounding erythema.  Extremities:  The
patient has extensive lymphedema of the bilateral lower
extremities with chronic stasis changes.  Dorsalis pedis
pulses are 2+ bilaterally.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  CBC notable for a white count of
6.1 and hematocrit of 48.2 which is far above the patient's
baseline in the 30's.  Chem-7 significant for a creatinine of
1.2, potassium 5.3, glucose 40.  Liver function tests show
alkaline phosphatase of 851 which is up from 512 on [**3-2**].  Albumin is 2.5.  AST is 73 and ALT 33 with a total
bilirubin of 0.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
1.  Increased alkaline phosphatase:  Several possibilities
for the initial increase in alkaline phosphatase at admission
include re-stenosis of the patient's hepatic artery which was
recently stented, cholangitis, worsening of her hepatitis C
chronic infection, rejection of her liver transplant.  The
patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound done to assess
for patency of her hepatic arteries as well as any other
liver abnormalities.  However, this study was normal showing
patent hepatic arteries.  There was also no evidence for
cholangitis or other acute liver infection.  It is possible
that this was due to worsening hepatitis C and hepatitis C
viral load was done and pending at the time of this
dictation.  Soon after admission the patient's alkaline
phosphatase began to decrease gradually each day.  Her other
liver function tests remained stable.  The patient was
continued on aspirin and Plavix for the recent hepatic artery
stent.

2.  Liver transplant:  There were no signs of acute rejection
of her liver to account for the liver function test
abnormalities.  She was maintained on CellCept.  Prograf
which she was recently started on was at a subtherapeutic
level of 1.6; however, this is a desirable level as patient
had previously had renal complications from this class of
immunosuppressive drugs.  Dose was actually decreased during
the hospital admission from 0.5 mg b.i.d. to 0.5 q. day.  She
is also continued on Bactrim for prophylaxis.

3.  Urinary tract infection:  The urinalysis on admission was
suggestive of a UTI.  Further urine culture and sensitivity
showed by Pseudomonas and Klebsiella infections of the
urinary tract.  The Klebsiella was only sensitive to
meropenem and possibly cefepime.  The patient was therefore
started on meropenem which was renally dosed and would be
continued for seven days.

4.  Delirium:  At times the patient appeared delirious during
the hospitalization.  It was thought that this was secondary
to narcotics which the patient had for pain control.  Her
fentanyl patch dose was reduced from 75 mcg to 50 mcg and her
breakthrough morphine sulfate immediate release was also
reduced in dosage and frequency.  She did appear to have less
mental status change after this change.

5.  Depression:  The patient was continued on Remeron for
depression.

6.  Hematocrit:  On admission the patient's hematocrit was
elevated much over her baseline.  Therefore, her Epogen was
discontinued.  Her hematocrit remained stable for the
hospitalization despite discontinuation of the Epogen.

7.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:  The patient was on a
low sodium, low fat diet; however, she was having poor p.o.
intake even though she stated she had a good appetite.  Her
blood glucose remained low much of the time in the 60's.  She
was encouraged to take increasing amounts of p.o.  At the
time of this dictation calorie counts were being done and
there was a possibility the patient might require
supplemental feeding through a nasogastric tube.

The rest of this dictation will be completed at a later date.
