   MODIFIED ACID-FAST STAIN FOR NOCARDIA (Final [**2158-6-19**]):
      Test cancelled by laboratory due to lack of branching gram
positive
      rods in the gram stain.
      Gram stain is an equally sensitive means of detecting
Nocardia in a
      primary specimen.
      Culture may be a more sensitive means of detecting
Nocardia and
      should be considered.

Echocardiogram on [**2158-6-13**]:
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function. No
resting LVOT  gradient.
IMPRESSION: Well seated aortic bioprosthesis with high-normal
gradient and  trace aortic regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild  mitral regurgitation.  If
clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define a
structural  abnormality involving the aortic valve.
