Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to Urology after undergoing
cystoprostatectomy and neobladder creation. No concerning
intraoperative events occurred; please see dictated operative
note for details. He initially progressed along as expected
tolerating a house diet by POD4, but then developed an ileus. A
CT scan POD 7 revealed a fascial dehiscence and he was taken for
emergent repair. Intra-operatively a small bowel anastomotic
leak was discovered.  General Surgery was called and assisted in
the anastomotic revision. Please see dictated operative notes
separately. He was taken to the ICU post-op for aggressive IVF
hydration due to Creatinine elevation. This elevation resolved
with hydration and returned to baseline. He was transferred to
the floor. Throughout his hospitalization he received SQ heparin
and pneumoboot prophylaxis.  However, he developed a PE
diagnosedby VQ scan. A hematology consult was called, IV
heparinization was performed and a L common femoral DVT was
discaovered. Since the time of revision he was unable to advance
his diet due to profound ileus and abdominal distension.  He
received TPN beginning POD3 from his revision until the day
before discharge. A GI consult was called and found no
definitive cause or therapy for his ileus. He developed gout in
his Left Ankle and Right Knee. A rheumatology consult was
obtained and a steriod taper performed. Gout resolved.
Eventually bowel functin returned. He transitioned to PO
coumadinization and became therapeutic. However, as diet
advanced his INR fell again to 1.6. His coumadin dose was
adjusted. Prior to discharge, a cystogram showed an intact
neobladder. The Foley was removed. He time-voided without
significant residuals. He was discharged to home to follow up
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and hematology. His primary care doctor, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], agreed to manage his post-op INR monitoring/coumadin
management.
