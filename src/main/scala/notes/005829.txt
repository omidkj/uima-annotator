Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea and vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy, intubation, central line placement, PICC line
placement, LOA with enterotomies and ostomy creation


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year old woman with a history of hepatic
sarcoidosis s/p TIPS, chronic partial small bowel obstructions,
and know grade II varices and esophagitis who was recently
discharged from this service who was re-admitted with melanotic
stools and vomiting. The day following discharge she reports
crampy abdominal pain and 14 episodes of tarry stools as well as
nausea and vomiting of bilious fluid, no coffee grounds or
blood. She denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or sweats. She
went to the ED where she was guaiac positive with no frank
blood. She was started on IV PPI, octreotide drip, and admitted
to medicine. Of note, she was discharged with an HCT of 24.6 and
re-admitted with a HCT of 22.5 which fell to 21.0 after 8hrs.
She was transfused 1U pRBC and bumped to 23.7 and stabilized
thereafter. She is transfered back to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4869**]
for further management.
.
On the floor her diarrhea initially improved ad then recurred on
tube feeds, erythromycin, and metoclopramide. She was also noted
to have eosinophilia and a low grade fever. There was concern
for malabsorption of the tube feeds v eosinophilic
gastroenteritis v sarcoid of the GI tract.
.
On [**2111-4-23**] underwent EGD to biopsy the small bowel for ?
eosinophilic enterocolitis and ? sarcoid of the GI tract. In
spite of being NPO she had a large volume of undigested food in
the stomach consistent with her ongoing GI dysmotility. She
aspirated during the procedure. Post procedure she became
increasingly hypoxic. She was transfered to the MICU where she
was intubated for hypoxia. She was empirically started on
vancomycin + pip/tazo for aspiration PNA. She became hypotensive
and was dependent briefly on pressors. On [**2111-4-24**] she underwent
bronchoscopy with BAL which showed GNRs in the lungs. She was
continued on vanco and pip/tazo. She improved and was extubated
and weanted from pressors. She was transfered back to the
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 679**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4869**] for further management of her ongoing GI
dysmotility. As of transfer her tube feeds had been restarted
and she began again to have diarrhea.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) Study Date of [**2111-4-17**] 10:42 PM
Multiple dilated air-filled loops of small bowel are seen
measuring up to 4.3 cm. On the upright view, there are several
differential air-fluid levels demonstrated. Gas is demonstrated
within the colon, which is not distended. A post-pyloric feeding
tube is seen with the tip of the feeding tube likely within the
jejunum. A TIPS is seen within the right upper quadrant of the
abdomen. The osseous structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION:
Findings suggestive of early or partial small-bowel obstruction.
 Feeding tube within the post-pyloric position.
.
MR 3D RENDERING W/POST PROCESSING ON INDEPENDENT WS Study Date
of [**2111-4-20**] 11:18 AM FINDINGS: Again seen is moderate distention
of the small bowel. There is also some fluid distention of the
right colon. The small bowel is mildly thick-walled. There is
moderate edema within the right colonic wall. On the
post-contrast images, there is moderate enhancement of the
mucosa in these regions. There is no obvious transition seen in
the bowel dilatation. Overall, given that the patient has portal
hypertension, the findings are most likely secondary to that. No
evidence to suggest Crohn's disease. No abscess or fistula is
identified. A nasoduodenal tube is present. Foley catheter in
the bladder. 2-mm cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney. The
liver appears nodular. It is only partially imaged. Partially
imaged spleen is at least 15 cm in length. There is a small
amount of ascites. TIPS shunt is seen extending from the portal
vein to the hepatic vein. The inferior mesenteric vein is
distended. On the T2 fat-saturated images, there is
heterogeneous marrow signal intensity seen in the medial aspect
of the left femoral head. Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations
delineated the dynamic series with multiple perspectives.
IMPRESSION: 1. Findings of cirrhosis with ascites and
splenomegaly. TIPS shunt is noted. 2. Dilated small bowel,
probably due to ileus. There is edema in the right colon, which
is probably due to portal hypertension. 3. There is increased
signal intensity seen on the T2-weighted images in medial aspect
of the left femoral head. This is nonspecific. If the patient
does not have hip pain, the findings could be due to bone marrow
edema from arthritis. the patient appears to have an osteophyte
extending from the posterior acetabulum. If the patient does
have hip pain, recommend CT to exclude fracture in the hip.
