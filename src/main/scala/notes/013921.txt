Admission Date:  [**2172-9-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2172-9-29**]

Date of Birth:   [**2108-5-29**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 21325**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year old
obese white female with a history of hypertension, coronary
artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2164**] and
[**2168**], in anterior and inferior distributions with an ejection
fraction of 10%.  She was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital
for congestive heart failure and Electrophysiology
management. The patient also has peripheral vascular disease,
bilateral lower extremity embolectomies, history of pulmonary
embolism, chronic atrial fibrillation, and a small
ventricular septal defect.

The patient's cardiac history began in [**2164**] when she
sustained an anterior wall myocardial infarction and
subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty/stent, with an left anterior descending with an
ejection fraction of 30 to 35%.  In [**2168**], she sustained an
inferior wall myocardial infarction.  Ejection fraction at
that time was 25%.

The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  An echocardiogram from
his office reveals a dilated left ventricle with hypokinesis
of the proximal anterior and inferior walls, dyskinesis of
the septum and akinesis with an ejection fraction of 10%.
The patient also had moderate bilateral atrial enlargement,
mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.

The patient recently underwent an increase in her diuretic
regimen with Zaroxolyn.  She had symptoms of fluid retention
which improved but she developed nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea with a decrease in weight of 25 pounds.  She was
admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital where she was given intravenous
fluids for dehydration.  Her creatinine was noticed to be
increased and she had an elevated digoxin level.  Telemetry
at the outside hospital revealed pauses.  She was transferred
on [**9-17**] to [**Hospital1 69**] for
evaluation for a biventricular pacer and for advanced
congestive heart failure management.

It was also noted during her hospitalization at [**Hospital **]
Hospital that her INR was around 10.  The patient states that
she did not feel well until after she had her second
myocardial infarction.  She has felt worse over this summer
with increased fluid retention, fatigue, some orthopnea and
increased lower extremity edema.  The patient also cites some
epigastric discomfort over the summer and some recent
diarrhea.

LABORATORY:  Data on admission showed a white count of 5.9,
hematocrit of 44.4 and a platelet count of 141.  Sodium was
141, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25,
BUN was 39, creatinine was 1.0.  Digoxin level was 1.4.  TSH
5.1.  Albumin was 3.8, calcium was 9.6 and magnesium was 2.0.

EKG showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 86 beats per
minute.  There was left axis deviation and a left bundle
branch block.

Chest x-ray disclosed cardiomegaly without evidence of
failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service
for further management.  The hospital course will be relayed
by systems:
1.  CARDIOLOGY:  A) Ischemia - the patient was continued on
her statin.  It was unclear why she was not on an aspirin so
aspirin was started.  The patient underwent a VO2 stress test
on [**9-21**].  The patient exercised for 4.25 minutes of a
modified [**Doctor Last Name 4001**] protocol and requested the test be stopped
for nausea.  The resting oxygen consumption was 3.2 ml per kl
per minute with a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.75.  Peak
exercise her oxygen consumption increased to 11 mm per kl per
minute with an expiratory exchange ratio of 0.86.  The peak
oxygen consumption was 45% of predicted.  The oxygen
consumption at the onset of the anaerobic threshold was 9.9
ml per kl per minute.  This test was not limited by muscle
fatigue, no arm, neck or back discomfort was reported by the
patient throughout the study.  The ST segments are
uninterpretable for ischemia in the setting of baseline left
bundle branch block.  The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with
several isolated VPCs and two ventricular couplets.  Blunted
systolic blood pressure response to exercise.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**9-22**]. The cardiac output was 3.6.  The cardiac index was 1.56
with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 mm of
Mercury.  There was no in-stent restenosis in the left
anterior descending.  There is a recanalized lesion in the
mid-RCA.

B) Rhythm - the patient was monitored on Telemetry throughout
her hospital stay.  She was initially noted to be in atrial
fibrillation.  On [**9-22**], she underwent an
Electrophysiology Study with mapping of the left ventricle.
On the night of [**9-22**], she was transferred to the
Cardiac Care Unit where she was administered Dobutamine to
optimize for the best cardiac index.  On [**9-23**], a
biventricular pacer and ICD was placed.  She was started on
amiodarone 400 mg three times a day for five days.  She will
then continue on Amiodarone 400 mg a day for 90 days, and
then will be tapered down to Amiodarone 200 mg q. day.

On [**9-29**], the pacer was interrogated and was found to be
working well.

C) Pump - the patient was initially on Norvasc when she came
in to the hospital.  She was started on Coreg 3.125 mg twice
a day.  An echocardiogram on [**9-21**], disclosed an
ejection fraction of 15%; there was right atrium and left
atrium dilatation.  The left ventricle was moderately
dilated.  There was severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was
severely depressed.  The right ventricle cavity was mildly
dilated.  Right ventricular systolic function was depressed
and with mild one plus mitral regurgitation.

Following placement of her pacemaker on [**9-23**], the
patient was transferred back to the Cardiac Care Unit where
she was noted to be hypotensive with systolic blood pressure
in the high 70s.  The hypotension was attributed to
hypovolemia.  There was concern for blood loss after the
pacemaker insertion, possibly from the carotid sinus.  The
patient was placed on Neo-Synephrine times two days.  On
[**9-24**], it was noted that her hematocrit dropped from 30
to 28.2.  She was transf
