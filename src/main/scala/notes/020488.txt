.
Scope ENT (on admission): Her glottic opening is about 4mm on
scope exam without symptoms including stridor or retraction.
.
CT neck with contrast ([**2105-4-16**]): Retropharyngeal fluid
collection spanning from C2/3 to C5/6 with extensive surrounding
edema and inflammation of the hypopharynx. The airway is
narrowed to 4mm at the level of the hyoid. Patent cervical
vasculature.
.
CXR ([**2105-4-17**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there
is no relevant change. No pathologic mediastinal widening.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Presence of minimal
pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No focal parenchymal
opacity suggesting pneumonia. No pulmonary edema.
.
CT neck and chest w/ contrast ([**2105-4-18**]):
1. Interval slight decrease of the retropharyngeal fluid
collection and
improved airway patency.
2. No evidence of Lemierre's disease or new abscess formation.

3. No evidence of extension of the fluid collection into the
mediastinum. No evidence of mediastinitis.
.
Chest CT ([**4-22**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Rapidly enlarging multiloculated right pleural effusion. This
could be due to empyema considering clinical suspicion for this
entity, but definitive diagnosis would require correlation with
thoracentesis results.
2. Small dependent left pleural effusion has also increased in
size since the prior study but does not have loculated
components.
3. Slight increase in size of pre- and sub-carinal lymph nodes
as well as right hilar nodes. These are likely reactive.
4. Ground-glass opacities in left upper lobe which are likely
infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
.
TTE ([**4-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**4-23**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient with
complicated pleural
effusion.

Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
to [**2105-4-21**].

There is interval increase in right pleural effusion, loculated,
better
appreciated on the prior radiograph but the change in size is
significant. No pneumothorax is seen. Left pleural effusion is
unchanged. Bibasal areas of atelectasis are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo F with PMHX of HTN presenting with sore throat, neck pain,
and odynophagia found to have epiglottis and retrophargyneal
phlegmon.
.
#Epiglottis/retropharyngenal phlegmon: Diagnosed on CT neck and
by ENT scope. Symptoms consistent with this. The patient did
improve clinically with steroids, Ceftriaxone and clindamycin.
The patient's airway was closely monitored in the ICU and
underwent repeat ENT scoping on [**2105-4-18**] that showed ongoing
arytenoid edema but completely patent airway. Repeat CT neck and
chest with contrast, in the setting of ongoing posterior neck
pain and inspiration pain as well as worsening erythematous
lesion (see below), did not show Lemierre's or mediastinitis.
There was minimal interval improvement in the phlegmon
collection, however. Blood cultures from admission were positive
for GNRs, later grew out HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE. Planned for 14
day course from day of first negative culture. The patient
remained hemodynamically stable and re-evaluation by ENT in the
ICU showed improved of supraglottic swelling so she was
transfered to the floor. Repeat cultures were negative ???? HIV
was sent and was negative. Patient continued to be symptom free
on the floor and did not have any further airway complaints or
problems. She was treated symptomatically with cepacol lozenges
and was kept on a nicotine patch and received nebulizers PRN.

#Erythematous lesion: Patient developed a 3X3
