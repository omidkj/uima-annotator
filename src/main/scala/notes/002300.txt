Date of Birth:   [**2089-5-8**]       Sex:  M

Service:  KIRLAND

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
gentleman with a history of schizo-affective disorder and
hyponatremia secondary to SIADH as well as psychogenic
polydipsia, history of hypertension, osteoarthritis, GERD,
and childhood asthma who presents on [**2139-8-1**] with a three
day history of shortness of breath and nonproductive cough as
well as increasing lower extremity edema.  He went to his PCP
and was found to have a saturation of 58% on room air that
increased to 88% on nonrebreather.  He was sent to the
Emergency Room.  A chest x-ray was consistent with
interstitial bilateral pulmonary infiltrates as well as
edema.  The patient received levo, Lasix, and was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service for workup of hypoxia.

On the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service, the patient was found to be increasingly
hypoxic with saturation of 88% which increased to 92% on
nonrebreather.  He was transferred to the MICU Service.  In
the MICU, the patient was felt to have a mixed CHF/community
acquired pneumonia picture.  He was maintained on Lasix,
azithromycin, and ceftriaxone and was maintained on BIPAP.
The patient improved on BIPAP and on [**2139-8-5**] was transferred
to the Medicine Service for further management.

While in the unit, the patient had a CTA which was positive
for lymphadenopathy and diffuse small areas of consolidation
but negative for PE or dissection.  A PTE was also performed
which revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, symmetric LVH,
left atrial enlargement, right atrial enlargement.  The
patient was diuresed in the MICU and his shortness of breath
improved considerably.  Additionally, his lower extremity
edema as well as cough also improved.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Schizo-affective disorder.
3.  Osteoarthritis.
4.  Lower extremity edema.
5.  GERD.
6.  SIADH.
7.  Psychogenic polydipsia.
8.  Hypothyroidism.
9.  Childhood asthma.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of MI at 40.  Mother died of MI
at 68.  Positive tobacco history.  Extensive smoking for
multiple years.  Currently smokes, although attempting to
stop.  No ETOH.  No other drugs.  Married times 11 years.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  SHORTNESS OF BREATH:  This was felt to
be due to a combination of CHF as well as community acquired
pneumonia.  His EF and E/A ratio were consistent with
diastolic dysfunction.  The patient also has lymphadenopathy
on CTA which needs to be followed up by his primary care
physician within [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few months with an x-ray or CT.  While on
the Medicine Service, the patient was continued on Lasix at
40 mg q.d. to 40 mg IV b.i.d. for fluid overload.  He had
very good response to this and diuresed nicely.  Otherwise,
he was continued on azithromycin for a total of five days and
his ceftriaxone was discontinued.  He was also maintained on
levofloxacin for better gram-negative coverage.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient had strict I&Os,
daily weights, and Lasix p.r.n.  He diuresed very nicely and
his oxygen saturations improved considerably on 2 liters.
The patient subjectively reported that he was feeling much
better with a decrease in cough as well as ease of breathing.

3.  ELECTROLYTES:  On admission, the patient's sodium was
found to be 111.  He was maintained on a fluid restriction
and his sodium self-corrected and improved.  By the date of
discharge, the sodium had corrected to 130.  The patient
should be continued on a fluid restriction at 1,000 cc per
day.  Otherwise, the patient had an elevated bicarbonate
which was felt to be consistent with contraction alkalosis
secondary to diuresis.  Additionally, his creatinine was
followed and creatinine remained within a normal range of 0.4
to 0.7 and he was also maintained on a low-salt diet.

4.  PSYCHIATRY:  The patient was maintained on Risperdal as
well as divalproex and Lorazepam.

5.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient's blood pressures are well
controlled on metoprolol as well as Captopril.  His
metoprolol was titrated up in an effort to afford better beta
blockade.  Additionally, Lipids were checked and were
elevated with LDL of 151, triglycerides 161, and HDL 24 with
a ratio of 8.6.  Hence, a statin was initiated.
Additionally, an aspirin was added for cardioprotective
benefits.

6.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient's TSH was also checked and was
within normal limits.  He was maintained on Synthroid.

7.  PHYSICAL THERAPY:  PT evaluate the patient and ambulated
with the patient.  The patient continued to desaturate on
ambulation to the 80s.  Hence, it was felt that the patient
should be placed at pulmonary rehabilitation for further
rehabilitation for his pulmonary status.  The patient was a
full code.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Community acquired pneumonia.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Schizo-affective disorder.
5.  Osteoarthritis.
6.  Lower extremity edema.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
8.  Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
9.  Psychogenic polydipsia.
10. Hypothyroidism.
11. Childhood asthma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Menthol lozenges one p.o. q. six hours p.r.n.
2.  Risperidone 2 mg p.o. q.a.m., 2.5 mg one p.o. q.h.s.
3.  Divalproex 500 mg one p.o. q.i.d.
4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg one p.o. q.d.
5.  Lorazepam 1 mg p.o. q.i.d.
6.  Levothyroxine 250 mcg one p.o. q.d.
7.  Metoprolol 25 mg one p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Captopril 12.5 mg one p.o. t.i.d.
9.  Enteric coated aspirin one p.o. q.d.
10. Lasix 60 mg one p.o. q.d.
11. Levofloxacin 500 mg one p.o. q.d. times five days.
12. Lipitor 10 mg one p.o. q.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair to stable.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1144**] on [**2139-8-17**] at 10:45 a.m.  This is the patient's
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] this visit, the patient's
electrolytes should be checked given that the patient is on
Lasix and has a history of hyponatremia secondary to SIADH
and psychogenic polydipsia.  Additionally, his potassium and
creatinine should be checked to assess for hypokalemia as
well as overdiuresis.  Furthermore, the patient's
lymphadenopathy on CTA should be followed up with periodic
chest x-ray/CTs.

DISPOSITION:   The patient will currently be discharged to a
rehabilitation center for pulmonary rehabilitation.  He will
likely have a five to ten day stay, at which time he will be
discharged to home and needs to follow-up with his primary
care physician as indicated.
