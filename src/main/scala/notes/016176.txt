Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH s/p PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
57 yo woman with prior known PMHx significant for COPD (no home
O2, no intubations), DM, HTN, CHF who presented to OSH with
prodrome of cough/dypnea who initially presented to [**Hospital **]
hospital [**5-29**] with dyspnea on exertion and cough for several
days.  At home, she was found to be 84% O2 sat on RA.  EMS was
called and she was given lasix 40mg in the ambulance, and
another 80mg in the ER.  Per report, she coded twice - once in
the ED and given ativan and norcuron and intubated, then again
in the CCU.  Reportedly, at 2:43-2:51 am, she had PEA arrest and
SVT requiring epinephrine and dopamine.  She then had asystole
for 1-2 minutes at [**Hospital1 **] CCU with bp 60/30 requiring atropine
and epinephrine.  Then at 3:20 am, right pupil noted to be 5 mm
and nonreactive.  Patient immediately went to head CT for right
parietal cortical hypodensity with sulci effacement; however,
negative for bleed.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the patient was hypotensive, and agitated.
Pressors were running through PIV from OSH.  A right IJ was
attempted, however, c/b tension PTX.  Chest tube was placed
emergently.  Later a right subclavian was attempted, and ended
up in subclavian artery.  Vascular surgery evaluated the patient
and the line was pulled.  Finally a femoral line placed and
dopamine was started for BP support.  Neurology evaluated the
patient for the finding of a fixed dilated pupil. Their
impression was that this was due to generalized hypoxic cerebral
damage.  Within 24 hours of admission, her pupil became
reactive.

TEE ([**2152-5-31**])
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are complex (>4mm and/or mobile) atheroma in
the aortic root. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
ascending aorta, atheroma in the aortic arch, and in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

TEE ([**2152-6-13**])
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta and aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. There is a small filamentous
strand attached to the aortic valve consistent with a Lambl's
excresence (normal variant). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the tricuspid valve or
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
.
During her MICU course, apparently the patient developed
significant subcutaneous air from her chest tube site.  The
chest tube was placed emergently in the ED, and as a result, the
entry wound was large.  Per report, she became markedly
edematous.  This later resolved after a second chest tube was
placed.  The chest tubes were pulled [**6-5**].  She was also
initially treated with levo/flagyl for presumed community
acquired vs. aspiration pneumonia.  She was treated for a total
10 day course.  She was also treated with high dose steroids
initially for COPD flare, which have been tapered since.  During
her ICU stay, she also received pressors for continued
hypotension.  Eventually she became hypertensive and required
increased doses of ACE for BP control.  On [**6-5**], the patient was
found to have MRSA bacteremia when blood cxs drawn were
positive.  She was started on Vanco with goal levels > 15.  The
following day, she was also found to have sputum and urine
positive for MRSA as well.  This was presumed to be VAP.
Further surveillance blood cxs since that time have been
negative.
.
The patient was successfully extubated [**2152-6-10**].  At that point,
she was no longer hypotensive and was stabilized on vancomycin
for ventilator associated MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia.  She
was transferred to the medicine service for further management.
.
After transfer to the floor the following issues were addressed:

.
1) COPD:  The patient was doing well s/p extubation [**6-10**].  She
was continued on prednisone 20 mg PO QD, and will need a long
taper after discharge (~3 weeks).  She was continued on
albuterol/atrovent nebs prn.
.
2) MRSA PNEUMONIA:  This was likely ventilator associated.  She
was started on vancomycin 1 gm IV Q8H.  She should be continued
on vancomycin for 14 days with levels maintained > 20.
.
3) MRSA BACTEREMIA: Her bacteremia was most likely secondary to
the MRSA pneumonia.  Follow up surveillan
