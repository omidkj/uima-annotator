Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Left-sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE


History of Present Illness:
59yo F h/o allergic rhinitis (without h/o asthma),
hypothyroidism, h/o cholestasis, s/p bioprosthetic mitral valve
thought to be needed after MI and papillary muscle infarction in
[**12-2**], who presented here on [**4-9**] with fatigue, lethargy and
weakness. Her current admission was preceeded by 5 days of
diarrhea and abdominal pain, with no BRBPR or melena. She
presented here on
[**4-7**] and was discharged after abdominal CT and CBC showed no
leukocytosis (eo's of 15). On [**4-8**], she had less of an appetite
and complained to her husband of feeling generalized fatigue,
with no other complaints.
   On the day of presentation, she could not stand or walk and
could not figure out how to put on her gloves and she was
brought here. Even at the time of my history, the patient cannot
relate much of what happened that day. But she confirms her
husband's report that she noticed the sudden inability to stand
or walk (she feels due to weakness) and she says that she was
"disoriented,"
although she cannot relate to me what she means by that. At
present, she denies changes in her vision that day. She denies
that she had chest pain or shortness of breath.

- deep venous thrombosis (arm; when line in place); coumadin
discontinued end of [**3-3**]
- s/p MVR (bio) [**12-2**]; rupture of papillary muscle and MI

- h/o eosinophilia

shoulders. She has normal internal and external rotation of her
hips, and flextion of her knees without effusions. No MTP

Pertinent Results:
CXR - AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Median sternotomy wires are
intact. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
limits. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear
without focal consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Contrast is seen within the left upper quadrant, likely
secondary to recent CT examination.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
CT - There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. There is a
hypodensity in superior aspect of the left frontal [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
represent an area of infarction.
There are calcifications in the basal ganglia bilaterally.
Surrounding osseous structures and soft tissues are
unremarkable. Imaged paranasal sinuses are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: Area of hypodensity in the left frontal [**First Name3 (LF) 3630**] may
represent an acute infarction or partial volume averaging,
correlation with MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] sequences is recommended to further
evaluate this finding.
.
MR - CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with left-sided weakness,
question of infarct or venous sinus thrombosis.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial images of the brain were acquired. Following
gadolinium, T1 axial and coronal images were obtained. 2D
time-of-flight MRV of the head and 3D time- of-flight MRA of the
circle of [**Location (un) 431**] were obtained.
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:
Diffusion images demonstrate multiple foci of slow diffusion in
both cerebral hemispheres distributed in the frontal and
parietal and occipital lobes. Small foci of slow diffusion are
also seen in both cerebellar hemispheres. Findings are
indicative of multiple bilateral supra and infratentorial acute
brain infarcts. Given the disc augmentation of multiple vascular
territories, embolic event is favored. There is no evidence of
acute or chronic hemorrhage identified. There is no mass effect,
midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
IMPRESSION: Multiple bilateral supra and infratentorial acute
brain infarcts.
MRV OF THE HEAD:
The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the superior
sagittal sinus and deep venous system. The left transverse sinus
is small in size, which could be a normal variation. The right
transverse sinus and jugular vein demonstrate normal flow
signal.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRV of the head. No evidence of sinus
thrombosis.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation. No evidence of vascular
occlusion or stenosis seen.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
.
ECHO - No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The
ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A
bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The motion of
the mitral valve prosthetic leaflets appears normal. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis. Normally-functioning
bioprosthetic mitral valve with trace regurgitation.
.
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Normal compressibility, color
flow, and Doppler waveforms are seen in the left internal
jugular vein, brachial, basilic veins. Though the left axillary
vein is not totally compressible, it shows normal color flow and
Doppler waveforms. Normal color flow and Doppler waveforms are
also demonstrated in the left subclavian vein.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.
.
Skin biopsy - Note: No vasculitis is seen in the sections
examined. No fungal organisms are seen on PAS stain. There is no
increase in dermal mucin on Alcian Blue stain. The findings are
consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction, such as to a drug,
in the appropriate clinical setting. Although less likely, other
considerations also include arthropod bites and an id reaction.
Clinical:  59 y/o white female with complex past medical history
who is admitted with hypertension, fatigue and neuropathy. The
patient also has diffuse morbilliform type rash on the chest,
back, upper extremities, eosinophilia and increased LFT's.
However, eosinophilia, rash and LFTs started prior to
hospitalization, prior to receiving antibiotics. Differential
diagnosis is DRESS/hypersensitivity reaction (due to MVI, NSAID,
