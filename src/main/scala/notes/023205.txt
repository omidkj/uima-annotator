Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Inderal / Fentanyl / Abacavir

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization s/p stent x 2 to LAD

History of Present Illness:
49M w/antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, premature CAD s/p MI X
6 (1st at age 33), family hx of premature CAD, PE in '[**75**], COPD
with 2-4 ppd x 40 year smoking history, and HIV (diagnosed in
'[**75**], on HAART with CD4 133 on [**2187-4-24**] who presented to the ED on
[**2187-6-4**] with 2/10 SSCP on exertion associated with left arm
heaviness. No N/V/SOB/diaphoresis. This was similar in quality
to his prior MIs but much less in intensity. No CP since [**7-13**].
Pt took two sublingual nitro without relief before he alerted a
passing police officer who brought him to the ED. Of note, pt
had INR checked on the Friday before admission (3 days ago) and
had an INR of 6.0. Therefore, he held his coumadin and his INR
on admission was 2.1 (goal 3.5-4.0).

In the ED, the patient was made pain free with 3 SL nitro. EKG
showed no new ischemic changes and old Q waves in II,III and
avF.

Pt admitted to medicine floor. Had Stress MIBI which showed
severe myocardial perfusion defect involving the entire inferior
wall, partially reversible, moderate, myocardial perfusion
defect involving the inferolateral and lateral walls. It was
decided to conservatively manage pt given his comorbitidies, and
high risk of thrombosis.

On the floor [**6-6**], heparin was d/cd in the evening. Soon after,
pt developed "[**5-20**]" SSCP, diaphoresis, vomited, and with arm
heaviness. EKG showed STE MI, with tombstoning in V2-V4, c/w
anterior MI in LAd distribution. He was urgently taken for
catheterization which showed: LAD-90% before D1, 70% after D1;
LCX-severe pro dz, mid occlusion, collaterals from left to
right; RCA: diffuse disease with serial lesions to 70% just
before bifurcation. His LAD was stented x 2 (hepacoat proximal
overlapped with zeta stent).


Past Medical History:
CAD s/p MI x 6 (1st in [**2171**]). S/p TPA x 2. Never been stented.
FHx of premature CAD (1 brother with CABG at 43)
Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
PE in '[**75**] on coumadin
H/O paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
HIV with CD4 126 ([**6-5**]) on HAART, diagnosed in '[**75**]. VL <50
[**4-14**].

Social History:
The patient formerly worked in the restaurant, accounting
business. He is currently retired. He still smokes 2 ppd but has

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course from admission to CCU. Other per HPI.

1. Cardiac
a. [**Name (NI) 2694**] Pt with h/o 6 MIs in past s/p TPA but never
stented. Had CP on admission, CE negative x 3 (CK 229, MB 6 peak
initially). MIBI showed
moderate-severe partially reversible defects in inferolateral
and lateral walls, which was unchanged from previous. Because of
the high risk of thrombosis, the decision was made to manage him
conservatively. On HD #3, [**2187-6-6**], he had an anterior STEMI,
peak CK 680. Cath showed 3VD and s/p stents x 2 to LAD. RFs for
pt include FHx CAD, HTN, smoking, and antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome. Likely correlation between d/cing heparin and this
event? MIBI day prior ([**6-5**]) showed mod-severe perfusion
deficits. Heparin was continued after catheterization (goal
60-80) as well as Integrilin for 18 hours post-cath. We
continues ASA, Plavix, and Statin (changed from pravastatin to
80 atorvastatin). Pt with allergy to beta blocker in that they
lead to severe pulmonary distress. Pt continues to smoke and is
not interested in stopping. Counselled regarding this. Will d/c
with asa/plavix/statin/ACE.

b. Pump- EF 27% on MIBI. Cath showed elevated PCWP. Diuresed
well after receiving Lasix in lab. Was on 100% NRB, successfully
titrated down to NC. We continued outpt dose of lasix and prn
initially, then not needed. We switched his ace inhibitor from
captopril tid to lisinopril qhs. Repeat echo showed: EF 25% and
global HK.

c. Rhythm- NSR with many PVCs/ occasional couplets. Monitored on
telemetry.

d. HTN- Regimen at home includes: Ace inhibitor (captopril 25
tid), diltiazem , verapamil, isosorbide mononitrate. There was
initially question as to why pt was on two DHP that act in the
same manner. However, we discussed with outpt PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and
pt followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Pt has been on this regimen for
years. He has been tried to be d/cd off of one leading to SVT.
We initially held his nitrate and diltiazem because systolic BP
was in 80s. These were added back on successfully.

2. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
Came in to hospital, subtherapeutic on Coumadin. Put on heparin
gtt, but d/cd night of STEMI, with subtherapeutic INR. His goal
INR is 3.5-4.0 as with APLA syndrome as well as a history of PE
in the past ('[**75**]). Pt was started on Coumadin 10 mg qhs; was on
heparin gtt (goal 60-80) which was d/ced [**6-10**] when INR 3.6.
Additionally, CTA was done to look for PE and was negative
([**2187-6-5**]). Had supratheraputic INR on day of discharge, so will
decrease coumadin to 2.5 X 2 days, then restart 5mg daily.

3. COPD
Continued home albuterol/flovent and Theophylline. Pt is not on
home O2.

4. Acute renal failure- Creatinine 1.0 ba
