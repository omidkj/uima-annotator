HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year-old
male with a history of diabetes, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and known coronary artery disease
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from an
outside hospital on [**2192-11-30**] after presenting there with
shortness of breath and found to have a troponin leak.  The
patient reported that on the day prior to his transfer here
he experienced shortness of breath while walking to his gym,
which resolved after about fifteen minutes of rest.  The
patient experienced the same symptoms later that day while at
his home.  He called his primary care physician and was told
to go to the Emergency Department.  The patient denied any
chest pain, chest pressure, radiating pain, lightheadedness,
palpitations, headache, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

The patient was reported to have had a Persantine nuclear
study in [**2192-8-23**], which showed fixed irreversible
diffusion abnormalities, distal and anterior wall
abnormalities, and fixed apical abnormalities.  The patient
was also reported to have had an echocardiogram performed one
year prior to his current symptoms, which showed an ejection
fraction of less then 25%.  An MRI performed on [**11-7**] showed
increased left ventricular cavity size with extensive left
ventricular septal dysfunction, right ventricular systolic
functions were within normal limits.  There was no myocardial
scarring or infarct noted.  There was disease in the left
main proximal left anterior descending coronary artery,
middle left circumflex and proximal right coronary artery.
The ejection fraction was noted to be 29% with a cardiac
output of 6.7 and a cardiac index of 3.2.

After one day admission at the outside hospital the patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, type 1
diabetes, prostate cancer, coronary artery disease,
hypercholesterolemia, hyperthyroidism, intermittent
claudication (barely one block, up until [**Month (only) 205**] able to walk
nine holes of golf) and neuropathy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Prostatectomy, bilateral cataracts,
CEA four years prior, arthroscopic left knee surgery,
appendectomy and tonsillectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  Humalog insulin 17 units in the morning and
Lantus insulin at 6 units at night, Captopril 100 mg po
b.i.d., Prilosec 10 mg po q day, Levoxyl 100 micrograms po q
day, Lasix 200 mg po q day, aspirin 81 mg po q day, Lipitor
10 mg po q day, vitamin E 400 mg po b.i.d., Pletal 50 mg po q
day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to sulfa drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father died of an myocardial
infarction at age 54.  He had diabetes.  Grandfather had
myocardial infarctions. The mother was reported to have
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is an ex-smoker.  He quit 23
years ago.  He had a total eighty packs a year history.  The
patient quit alcohol eight years prior.  He use to two drinks
per day.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2192-11-30**] and scheduled to have a
cardiac catheterization.  This was performed on the day of
admission with a finding of diffuse disease of the left
anterior descending coronary artery proximally with total
occlusion distally, mild to moderate disease of the left
circumflex, and 60% stenosis of the mid right coronary
artery.  Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation was requested
and the patient was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass
graft on [**2192-12-4**].  The patient underwent the procedure
without complications and had four vessel bypass with the
left internal mammary being grafted to the left anterior
descending coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to
the obtuse marginal, right coronary artery - PD and DX.  The
patient was then transferred to the CSRU for continued
monitoring.  He had an uneventful stay in the CSRU with only
notable issues being his blood sugar control.  The patient
was seen by the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 982**] Clinic consultation team with
recommendations made on his diabetic medication management.
The patient was transferred to the CP Surgery floor on postop
day number three, but had to be returned for blood glucose
control with blood glucose over 400.  His blood sugar was
quickly brought under control on an insulin drip.  His
regimen by mouth optimized and the patient transferred once
again to the CP Surgery floor on postop day number four.

During the [**Hospital 228**] transfer from the surgery floor back to
the unit on postoperative day number three his left thigh
incision was noted to have dehisced.  The wound was
reapproximated with interrupted sutures.  The patient's wound
was unfortunately contaminated with urine before closure.  On
postoperative day number five the patient was noted to have
an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  A
cardiology consultation was requested.  The cardiology team
was of the opinion that the patient needed to be risk
stratified, but given the evolving infection in his left
thigh wound it would not be possible to consider the
placement of an implantable defibrillator.  The benefits of
beta blockers were discussed with the patient, but given the
patient's history of fatigue and other side effects with beta
blockers treatment was not initiated at that time.  On
postoperative day number six the patient's left thigh wound
was noted to have some erythema and the patient was started
on Keflex.  An echocardiogram was also performed.  On
postoperative day number seven the decision was made to
change the patient's antibiotic medication from Keflex to
Ciprofloxacin.  His blood sugar remained well controlled.
Following three days on antibiotic therapy the patient's
thigh wound appeared only minimally improved, although his
white count was beginning to trend downward.  It was
ultimately decided that it would be best to open the wound
and begin packing with wet to dry dressings.  The patient's
blood sugar remained well controlled.

The patient had no further episodes of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia, although he did have a brief run of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  By postoperative day number
ten the patient was in stable condition and ready for
discharge to a skilled nursing facility.  The patient's wound
was opened, well irrigated and then packed prior to
discharge.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po b.i.d.
(started [**2192-12-11**]).  Ibuprofen 400 mg po t.i.d. prn,
Albuterol - ipratropium one to two puffs q 6 hours prn,
Atorvastatin 10 mg po q day, Protonix 40 mg po q day,
Captopril 25 mg po t.i.d., Levoxyl 100 micrograms po q day,
Milk of Magnesia prn, Percocet one to two tablets po q 4 to 6
hours prn, Tylenol 325 to 650 mg po q 4 to 6 hours prn,
enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q day, Lasix 40 mg po
b.i.d., Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., insulin Glargine 36 units at
bedtime, Humalog insulin sliding scale (the patient will also
need potassium prn).

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] in clinic four weeks following discharge.  The
patient is also to follow up with the Electrophysiology
Service for evaluation for his need for an implantable
defibrillator.  The patient will also need to follow up with
his primary care physician two to four weeks following
discharge.  The patient is scheduled to come back to the
Medical Center for a wound check in two weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass
graft.
2.  Wound infection.
3.  Arrhythmia.
