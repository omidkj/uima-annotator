on vent and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.

found to be 31.  Initial ABG 7.12/120/434, lactate 1.3.  She was
placed on the ventilator, given 7 liters of fluid with 1 liter
UO.  Her C-spine was cleared.  CT head unremarkable.  She
received one dose of Decadron 10 mg, Vanco, CTX 2 gms, and
Flagyl.  Left femoral line was placed.  Pt has right PICC line
(unclear when placed).  Required levophed briefly when given

[**2104-3-17**] Echo: Conclusions:
Limited views.
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
3. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient
is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. The aortic
prosthesis
cannot be adequately assessed. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression:
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Would recommend a
TEE if
clinically indicated.
--------------------
[**2104-3-17**] PORTABLE AP CHEST.
Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
Lung fields are clear. No pneumonia, CHF, pleural effusions, or
pneumothorax. The tracheostomy tube is in good position.
.
IMPRESSION: No change compared to the prior radiograph obtained
one day earlier.
---------------
[**3-16**] EKG:
Baseline artifact
Sinus tachycardia
Possible biatrial abnormality although is nondiagnostic
Otherwise may be normal ECG but baseline artifact makes
assessment difficult
Since previous tracing of [**2103-5-3**], sinus tachycardia rate faster

-----------
CT head [**3-16**]:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of
normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation appears preserved. A few small areas of focal
punctate calcification are seen within the right lobe of the
cerebellum, left occipital lobe, and along the falx. These are
unchanged compared to the prior examination. Osseous structures
and soft tissues are normal. Minimal mucosal thickening is seen
in the ethmoid air cells.
---------------
CT c-spine [**3-16**]: FINDINGS: In the sagittal projection the C1
through upper portion of T2 vertebral bodies are visualized.
Normal vertebral body height and alignment with preservation of
disc space height. Mild degenerative changes are seen with
anterior osteophytes at the C5 and C6 levels. No fractures are
seen. Prevertebral soft tissues are normal. The spinal canal is
essentially normal in caliber.
.
A tracheostomy tube is present. The visualized portion of the
upper lung fields is clear. Soft tissues demonstrate small
bilateral lymph nodes in the cervical region.
.
IMPRESSION:
Mild degenerative changes in the mid cervical spine. No fracture
identified.
------------
CXR [**3-16**]:Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates the
patient to be status post sternotomy, new when compared to
[**2103-5-3**]. Tracheostomy is in place. Cardiomediastinal contours
are unchanged. Increased, bilateral, airspace opacities
represent mild-to-mod
