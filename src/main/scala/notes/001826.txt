Service:  ACOVE Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 49-year-old female
with past medical history of breast cancer status post
lumpectomy and radiation, asthma, COPD, and current tobacco
use, who was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**10-20**] for an
asthma/COPD exacerbation, and was transferred over to [**Hospital1 1444**] intubated on [**2102-10-23**].

The patient reports having a recent trip to [**Country 2784**] during
which she was treated with prednisone for unknown reason.
Upon return to the United States, she developed shortness of
breath and cough.  Presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2102-10-20**].  At that time, she was felt to be having an asthma or
COPD exacerbation.  Was treated with steroids and inhalers.
On [**2102-10-22**], the patient was found unresponsive and
was an extremely difficult intubation.  Several of the
patient's teeth were reportedly chipped on the intubation
attempts, and the patient eventually required a
cricothyroidotomy for immediate airway management.

Her ABG at that time had a pH of 7.01, pCO2 of 195, and a pO2
of 77 with a bicarb of 54.  A followup chest x-ray shows
aspiration.  She was placed on clindamycin in addition to her
Biaxin for COPD exacerbation.  She had a normal
echocardiogram and anterior ST elevations on an EKG at the
outside hospital, but she was ruled out by serial enzymes.
She was transferred over to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2. Asthma.
3. Breast cancer.
4. Hypertension.
5. Tobacco use.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, beta blockers causing wheezing.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Protonix 40 mg daily.
2. Tylenol prn.
3. Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d.
4. Clindamycin 600 mg IV q.8.
5. Flovent q.4h.
6. Albuterol q.4h.
7. Methylprednisolone 60 mg IV q.8h.
8. Insulin-sliding scale.
9. Fentanyl and midazolam drips for sedation while intubated.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.2, heart rate 89-118,
blood pressure 153/89, oxygen saturation 92% on 4 liters.
General:  Overweight in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Moist
mucosal membranes.  Supple neck.  Anicteric sclerae.
Cardiovascular examination:  Tachycardic, regular, no murmurs
appreciated.  Lungs:  Expiratory wheezes heard throughout,
prolonged expiratory phase.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds,
soft, mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
Extremities:  No edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
Neurological examination:  Alert, moves all extremities, and
follows commands.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 12.4,
hematocrit 35.1, platelets 165.  BUN 27, creatinine 0.2.  AST
and ALT were normal.  TSH 0.10 with a normal free T4.

Chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusions and
atelectasis at the right base.

EKG showed sinus rhythm with a question of an old septal
infarct.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Asthma/COPD exacerbation:  At the [**Hospital1 190**], the patient quickly improved and extubated in
the OR on [**10-27**], and at that time was noted to be an
easier intubation than previously thought.  The patient
tolerated extubation well, but continued to require
albuterol, Atrovent inhalers every four hours as well as high
dose prednisone for several days.

The patient's oxygen requirement decreased.  The patient was
transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit to the regular
medical floors on [**10-29**].  At that time, her oxygen
requirement continued to be weaned, and on the day of
discharge, she had oxygen saturations in the mid 90s on room
air.  The patient was discharged on prednisone taper and
scheduled Combivent with albuterol prn.  The patient was not
treated with antibiotics as she never developed a lobar
pneumonia, bacteremia, or fever.  This was felt to be an
asthma exacerbation and antibiotics were not indicated.

2. Tachycardia:  The patient was often mildly tachycardic.
This was thought to be secondary to frequent use of albuterol
as well as secondary to deconditioning after a prolonged
hospital stay and intubation.  However, in light of the
patient's mild tachycardia and mild hypoxia, an
echocardiogram and chest CTA were performed for pulmonary
emboli.

The chest CTA did not show any evidence of pulmonary emboli.
In addition, there were no lung nodules seen.  The only
findings of the chest CTA were thickening of the distal
esophagus, which is not clinically significant at this time
as the patient did not have dysphagia or odynophagia, and
there were also mild emphysematous changes of both lower
lobes of the lungs.  The patient's echocardiogram showed only
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a
hyperdynamic left ventricle with an ejection fraction of
75-80%.  In addition, there was a moderate resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

3. Breast cancer:  The patient reports having a history of
breast cancer with status post lumpectomy and radiation.  She
is followed by an outside oncologist.  The patient continued
to state that she has new lung nodules that she was very
concerned about.  However, a chest CTA did not reveal any
lung nodules at this time.  The patient was instructed to
followup with her outside oncologist at [**Hospital3 3583**].

4. Drug seeking behavior:  The patient throughout her
hospital stay, continued to demand pain medication as much as
possible.  During the hospital stay, the patient was treated
with a 25 mcg/hour Fentanyl patch and Percocet prn for
breakthrough pain.  The patient was discharged with her
Fentanyl patch and 10 Percocet for breakthrough pain.  The
patient will follow up with her primary care physician within
one week of discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable on room air.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with followup.
