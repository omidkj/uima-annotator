HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]. is the former
3.475-kilogram product of a 37-1/7-week gestation pregnancy

OBSTETRICAL HISTORY:  Is notable for an intrauterine fetal
death at 36 weeks.

PRENATAL SCREENS:  Blood type O-positive, antibody negative,
rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, group B Strep status unknown.

This pregnancy was complicated by insulin dependent
gestational diabetes and elevated blood pressure. The mother
was taken to repeat cesarean section due to the history of
fetal demise and decreased fetal heart rate with this infant.
Apgars were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. The infant was
evaluated in the delivery room for respiratory distress and
admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for further
observation and treatment.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS INCLUDING PERTINENT LABORATORY
DATA:
1.  Respiratory: [**Known lastname **] had oxygen saturations less than 90% in
    room air. Was started on nasal congestion O2. His maximum
    oxygen requirement was  1.5 liter per minute. He
    remained in oxygen through day of life #4. Chest x-ray
    initially was suggestive of transient tachypnea of the
    newborn with fluid in the fissure, normal lung volumes.

    Due to the progression of his clinical course, a repeat
    chest x-ray was done that was more consistent with
    aspiration or pneumonia, and [**Known lastname **] was treated with a week of
    antibiotic therapy. At the time of his discharge, he is
    breathing comfortably in room air with a respiratory rate
    of 30-60 breaths per minute with oxygen saturations
    96-99% in room air.

2.  Cardiovascular: [**Known lastname **] has remained normotensive with
    normal heart rates. No murmurs have been noted. Baseline
    heart rate is 140-160 beats per minute.

3.  Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition: [**Known lastname **] was initially
    NPO and maintained on intravenous fluids. Enteral feeds
    were started on day of life #2 and gradually advanced. At
    the time of discharge, he was breast feeding or taking
    Enfamil 20. Weight on the day of discharge is 3.335
    kilograms with a corresponding head circumference of 34
    cm and a length of 48 cm. Serum electrolytes were checked
    on day of life #1 and 2 and were within normal limits (Na
    143 K 4.8 Cl104 CO2 21).

4.  Infectious disease: Due to the unknown etiology of the
    respiratory distress, [**Known lastname **] was evaluated for sepsis. A
    complete blood count was within normal limits (wbc 19.7
    79 Poly 1Band 12 Lymph. A blood culture was obtained prior
    to initiating ampicillin and gentamicin therapy. Blood
    culture was no growth at 48 hours. [**Known lastname **] completed a 7-day
    course of antibiotics because of pneumonia. Gentamicin
    levels were within normal limits (peak 8.4 trough 0.7).

5.  Gastrointestinal: Peak serum bilirubin occurred on day of
    life 4, total of 11.5 mg per deciliter/0.3 mg per
    deciliter direct. Repeat on day of life #5 had a total of
    11.3 with the same direct value. No treatment was necessary.

6.  Neurological: [**Known lastname **] has maintained a normal neurological
    exam during admission. There are no concerns at the time
    of discharge.

7.  Hematology: Hematocrit at birth was 50%. [**Known lastname **] did not
    receive any transfusions of blood products.  Plt count 267.

8.  Sensory: Audiology: Hearing screening was performed with
    automated auditory brainstem responses. [**Known lastname **] passed in
    both ears.

9.  Circumcision: The evening prior to discharge [**Known lastname **] had his
    circumcision performed. He was noted to have some prolonged
    bleeding. The obstetrician who performed the procedure placed
    surgiseal on the wound. Just prior to discharge it began to
    bleed again. The covering obstetrician cauterized the site
    with resolution of the bleeding.  He was observed in the NICU
    approximate 1.5 hours after the cauterization without any
    further bleeding noted.

    in his car seat for 90 minutes without any episodes of
    bradycardia or oxygen desaturation.
4.  State newborn screen was sent on [**2173-2-8**] with no

    abnormalities, or school-age siblings; or 3. With chronic
    lung disease.

    Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall
    for all infants once they reach 6 months of age. Before this

    immunization against influenza is recommended for household
