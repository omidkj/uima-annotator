Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
66 M with CNS lymphoma with last chemo [**8-14**], Waldenstrom's
macroglobulinemia, and PMR who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with a one
week history of cough productive of whie/tan sputum, shortness
of breath and fevers (up to 102.5 on the night prior to
admission).  The patient reported feeling weak, tired, poor
appetite with little po intake. He also reported shaking chills,
night sweats and mild headaches over the top of his head.
.
On ROS, he denied photophobia, neck stiffness, n/v, abdominal
pain. He also denied dysuria, melena, BRBRP, diarrhea, CP,
edema, orthopnea, PND. His baseline gait is reportedly slightly
unsteady, with some forgetfullness since CNS lymphoma diagnosed.
.
The patient was initially admitted to the general medicine floor
where he was treated with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for a
multilobar pneumonia. He was intermittently tachypneic and
tachycardic on the floor. On HD2, the patient was felt to be in
impending respiratory failure with persistent supraventricular
tachycardia and was transferred to the MICU. There he received a
diltiazem drip for rate control and diuresis for volume overload
had dramatic improvement in his respiratory status. His
antibiotic regimen was broadened from ceftriaxone/azithromycin
to cefpodoxime/azithromycin.

.
CXR ([**5-6**]): Findings most consistent with pulmonary edema, but
atypical viral or mycoplasma infection should be considered. If
the patient immune compromised, this could also represent PCP.
.
CXR ([**5-7**]): Interval worsening of bilateral diffuse opacities
consistent with worsening pulmonary edema. However, worsening
superimposed pneumonia should also be considered.
.
EKG ([**5-8**]): atrial fib/flutter at 125 bpm

MRI of the brain with gadolinium:
Exam compared to prior study of [**4-14**].
FINDINGS: There has been no change from the previous
examination.   Abnormalities in the right hemisphere previously
described are not changed. The ventricular catheter remains in
place. Ventricular dimension is expanded but unchanged in size.
There is no evidence of abnormal diffusion. There is no evidence
of new mass effect or hemorrhage. There is no evidence of a new
focal extraaxial lesion or fluid collection.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance compared to the prior study. No
definte
evidence of new mass effect or hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 M with CNS lymphoma with last chemo [**8-14**], Waldenstrom's
macroglobulinemia, and PMR who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with a one
week history of productive cough, SOB and fevers called out of
MICU after being treated for rapid AF and heart failure.
.
1. SOB: Multifactorial. Pt likely had multifocal pna which
exacerbated atrial fibrillation which lead to worsening heart
failure in the setting of fluid resuscitation. Will continue Abx
to tx multilobar pneumonia. Pt with continued evidence of heart
failure on exam, with elevated JVP, crackles and mild edema. Pt
just transitioned to [**Hospital1 **] furosemide-continued throughout course
on the floor. Pt also with wheezing on exam, likely attributable
to cardiac wheeze from volume overload but potentially related
to his history of bronchiectasis- continues ipratropium nebs
throughout hospitalization as these have helped him.
- Cefpodoxime day 5 on d/c
- Azithro day 5 on d/c
- Continued lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **], fluid goal of > -1L as mentioned
above
- Continued beta blocker and diltiazem for rate control as above
- Continued ipratropium for bronchospasm as above
.
2. Tachycardia: Pt appeared to have atrial fibrillation/flutter
by EKGs, likely exacerbated by pulmonary process. Has been
rate-controlled with diltiazem and lopressor. Continued since
leaving MICU - can titrate as necessary as an outpatient.
- Continued on  diltiazem 360mg daily
- Continued on lopressor 75mg tid, consider increasing to 100mg
tid if needed
- Held albuterol and ritalin since these would increase heart
rate.
.
3. CNS Lymphoma: Has been asymptomatic and stable. Neurologic
exam [**Last Name (un) **] non-focal throughout. Initial unsteadiness on
admission likely secondary to systemic illness rather than acute
neurologic event. Neuro-Onc followed on the floor. MRI was
without changes.
.
4. FEN: Electrolytes wnl. Full diet.  Fluids restricted.
.
5. Prophylaxis: Continued on lovenox for DVT. Given PPI for
prophylaxis.
