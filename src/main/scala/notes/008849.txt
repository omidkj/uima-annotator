Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest/Neck Pain, Hypokalemia, Ventricular Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Substrate ablation for VT
Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 62883**] is a 62 yo man with h/o CAD, DM, Bipolar d/o, COPD,
ETOH cirrhosis, transferred from [**Hospital3 **] today for
further management of ventricular tachycardia.  Last night, he
developed left-sided chest and neck pain which is was his
anginal equivalent when he had IMI in [**2138**].  He denies SOB,
exertional dyspnea, PND.  He has had increased abdominal
swelling since stopping his lasix > 1 month ago but reports no
LE edema.
.
He called 911 and was brought to [**Hospital3 7569**] where he was
found to be in VT with SBPs initially in 80s.  He was shocked x
2 and his rhythm transitioned to afib with RVR with SBPs in 70s,
after which he was shocked again, returning to NSR with no acute
ST changes on EKG.  Only when given etomidate and sedation prior
to shocks did he lose consciousness.  He was initiated on
amiodarone, nitro, and heparin drips.  He later reverted to
another extended run of ventricular tachycardia which appears to
have resolved spontaneously.  Of note, his potassium at [**Location (un) **]
was initially 2.6, which was treated prior to arrival in ED
here.

In ED, here, repeat K 4.0, glucose 482.  SBPs stable and pt.
noted to be in NSR on EKG and transferred to CCU for possible
cath.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools (though he has h/o portal gastropathy and
GI bleed per previous OSH notes). He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
.
He does report polyuria, polydipsia X 3-6 months, constipation,
increased stress and anxiety in the last few weeks with
increased nicotine and caffeine intake.  No nausea, diarrhea,
emesis.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain as above,
absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

years ago)

Cardiac Risk Factors: + Diabetes, + Hypertension, +
hyperlipidemia, + smoking
.
Cardiac History:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2138**] and [**2143**] anatomy as
follows:
posterior LV branch stent at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2138**]. Consequently, the
inferoposterior wall of his heart is severely hypokinetic and
his ejection fraction remains at 40%.  He was evaluated with
cardiac catherization [**2143-4-9**] which demonstarted 90% R-PDA
lesion that was stented with a bare metal stent. The  80% lesion
in the posterior LV branch could not be treated as balloons
would not deliver into that vessel.


Social History:
Patient is divorced and lives alone. He worked as a concession
manager in the carnival business but due to medical issues has
not worked since last Spring. Patient has smoked up to 2-3 packs
a day for approximately 35-40 years. He is currently smoking one
pack a day.
His parents are deceased.  He has a biological son who is
currently in prision in PA.  He did not have this son with his
ex-wife.

 No abdominial bruits.  + BS throughout

Pulses:

Pertinent Results:
Initial rhythm strip in EMS shows monomorphic wide-complex VT at
219, L BBB pattern.  Seems to originate from low anteroseptal
area.
It appears, that he develops monomorphic VT in RBBB after
initial shock on rhythm strip.  Shocked again, and appears to
irregular narrow complex tachycardia, likely afib with RVR.
Eventually, transitions back to monomorphic VT.  12-lead from
that shows RBBB pattern c/w origin from inferolateral focus.
.
EKG here shows NSR at 76 with IVCD (old), nl QT, Qs in inferior
leads c/w old inferior MI, also old
EKG demonstrated *** with no significant change compared with
prior dated ***.
.
Echo [**3-20**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypo/akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
The apical segments are not well seen (?LVEF = 40 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-10-9**],
the findings are similar.

Cardiac Cath 3/[**2145**]. COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.  The LAD had
a 30%
mid vessel lesion and a 30% D2 lesion.  The LCX had no
angiographically
apparent flow-limiting disease.  The RCA had patent stents with
a 80%
distal lesion prior to the posterolateral branch and a 30% PDA
lesion.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 20 mm Hg and LVEDP of 34 mm Hg.  There
was
moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension of 49/21 mm
Hg.
There was normal systemic arterial hypertension of 124/57 mm Hg.
 There
was no transvalvular gradient upon pullback of the catheter from
LV to
aorta. Cardiac index was preserved at 3.9 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed inferior akinesis with
moderate to
severe anterior hypokinesis and an LVEF of 30%.  There was trace
mitral
regurgitation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
