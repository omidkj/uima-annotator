MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2147-4-23**] MRSA screen - negative
[**2147-5-7**] VRE Swab - negative
[**2147-5-7**] UCx - yeast >100,000 org/ml; asymptomatic; noted in all
urine cultures throughout hospitalization
[**2147-5-5**] A-line tip - negative
All blood, stool cultures negative; C diff negative x6
throughout hospital course

IMPORTANT STUDIES:
[**2147-4-21**] CXR: PA and lateral chest x-rays were obtained. There is
no comparison. The right PICC line terminates at the atriocaval
junction, in satisfactory position. There is minimal left lower
lobe subsegmental atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation
or pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.

[**2147-4-21**] Abd US:
1. Extremely echogenic liver consistent with the history of
liver disease.
Ascites in three of four quadrants.
2. Patent portal vein, but with reversal of flow (hepatofugal).

[**2147-4-29**] CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS w/o contrast:
1. Large left rectus abdominis wall fluid collection, suggestive
of hematoma. Given lack of contrast, abscess is not excluded. No
retroperitoneal hematoma is identified, however blood may be
present in extraperitoneal space.
2. Diffuse colonic wall thickening highly suggestive of
colitis/edema.  Differential considerations include primarily
infectious (C. diff should be considered given patient's ICU
status), inflammatory causes, and much less likely ischemic
colitis.
3. Perihepatic and right lower quadrant ascites with diffuse fat
stranding throughout the mesentery, consisent with volume
overload.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions, slightly greater on the left
when compared to the right with scattered opacities.
5. Mild cardiomegaly.
6. Gastric post-surgical changes.

[**2147-4-30**] R Lower exrremity ultrasound:
REASON FOR EXAM: Status post right femoral line placement.
Clinical concern for hematoma.
ULTRASOUND IMAGES OF THE RIGHT GROIN: This study is minimally
limited due to a bandage overlying the right groin. No definite
hematoma was visualized. The right common femoral artery and
vein demonstrate normal color and Doppler flow. There is no
evidence of pseudoaneurysm.

[**2147-5-1**]:
INDICATION: 44-year-old female with liver failure, DIC, right
upper extremity swelling. Evaluate for DVT.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for right upper extremity DVT.

[**2147-5-8**] CXR 2 view:
The position of the Dobbhoff catheter is unchanged and
satisfactory. Multifocal consolidation remains unchanged with no
newly
developed areas of consolidation.

[**2147-5-8**] Abd US:
1. Echogenic liver consistent with history of liver disease.
2. Slow and reversal flow in the main portal vein. Reversal flow
in the left portal vein.
3. Sufficient fluid to mark site for paracentesis.
4. Extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation, and mild intra-hepatic
biliary duct dilatation.

[**5-15**] Liver biopsy pathology:
Liver, transjugular needle core biopsy:
1.  Nodular fragments of hepatic parenchyma and broad fibrous
septal tissue, consistent with cirrhosis (trichrome stain
evaluated; a focal sinusoidal fibrotic component is identified).
2.  Mild, mixed steatosis (involving <33% of the parenchyma),
with prominent associated intracytoplasmic hyalin.
3.  Moderate septal and lobular mixed inflammation with a marked
neutrophilic component.
4.  Moderate canalicular and hepatocellular cholestasis.
5.  Iron stain shows mild iron deposition in periportal
hepatocytes and Kupffer cells.
Note:  The findings are consistent with an acute-on-chronic
toxic/metabolic injury.  No diagnostic features of autoimmune
hepatitis are identified in this limited sample. Discussed with
pathologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7017**] - While prednisone will affect the
histologic app
