Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower GI Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transfused 1 unit PRBC's

History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year-old female with a history of severe COPD on
home O2, Restrictive Lung Disease, A-fib s/p PPM ([**7-19**]
complicated by RV rupture and tamponade and ischemic R leg
requiring thrombectomy, fasciotimy and endarterectomy),
ICM/chronic CHF EF40%, CAD s/p NSTEMI [**7-19**] (99% prox LAD, failed
PCI) and h/o lower gi bleed presents with bright red blood per
rectum. The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) 102066**] for lower GI bleed likely [**3-14**] diverticular bleed
requiring 15U pRBC during her course. At an OSH a bleeding scan
showed a likely focus in the L colon. However, a bleeding scan
performed here did not reveal a source. An IR embolization was
attempted, but the bleed could not be localized. GI was
consulted and waited for the bleeding to stop to perform a
colonoscopy that showed diverticulosis, but no active bleed. Her
Hct's remained stable and there was no further evidence of
bleed. She was discharged to [**Hospital1 700**] on [**8-31**].

.
This morning while the patient was being changed at rehab there
was a large amount of bright red blood and clot soiling her
sheets. She reports no previous episodes and did not notice the
bleed. She reports no complaints at the time. The vitals signs
were HR 77, BP 135/59, 97% 2L, afebrile. She was sent to the ED
for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, VS 98.2, HR:76, BP:136/40, RR:20, 96%3L. An exam
showed continued bright red blood and clots per rectum. She had
complaints of lightheadness, but no CP or SOB. Her Hct was 33.3
on admission (Hct was 33.4 at the time of discharge [**8-30**]), but
appeared "dry" on exam. She was typed and crossed 2U and
transfused 1U. She was also given 1L NS. Two 18g PIV were
placed. Her vitals signs remained stable. GI was contact[**Name (NI) **] with
plans for scope vs IR embolization. Surgery was also contact and
patient is not a good surgical candidate given comorbidities.
.
Of note her prior admission was complicated by wound infection
at site of prior thrombectomy with culture growing mod
pseudomonas and sparse MRSA. The patient was treated with
Cefepime with plans to continue until [**9-13**] when she follows up
with [**Hospital **] clinic.

Brief Hospital Course:
# GI Bleed: Pt with BRBPR.  Recent admission for similar
symptoms revealed likely source was diverticular bleed, although
no active bleeding was found on cscope.  Additionally, bleeding
scan and attempted IR embolization were unable to locate bleed.
She did require a total of 15U pRBC during her last admission.
The patient is on [**Month/Year (2) **] and [**Month/Year (2) 4532**] for medical management of her
NSTEMI in [**7-19**].  Admission Hct was 33, although she may be
hemoconcentrated.   She was transfused 1 unit PRBCs and serial
Hcts have remained stable.  Gen surgery consulted, pt not a good
surgery candidate.  GI consulted, no need for scoping as pt not
currently bleeding and hemodynamically stable. Aspirin and
[**Date Range 4532**] were held.  [**Date Range **] will not be restarted.  Aspirin will
be restarted at lower dose.
.
#. CAD s/p NSTEMI [**7-/2185**]: Pt with unsuccessful PCI of 99% LAD
stenosis. She was medically managed on [**Year (4 digits) **], [**Year (4 digits) 4532**], simvastatin,
metoprolol, lisinopril and Imdur. Lisinopril was restarted on
[**9-4**] as pt was hemodynamically stable.   Aspirin was reduced to
81 mg po daily.  [**Month/Year (2) **] was discontinued in the absence of stent
placement, and given second episode of bleeding in the 3 weeks
after initiation of these medications.  Metoprolol was held
throughout hospitalization, and given borderline blood pressure
after administration of 12.5 mg today, will not be started until
her blood pressure rises.
.
#. COPD, oxygen (2.5L) and steroid-dependent. She was continued
on a prolonged prednisone taper, which should be discussed with
her home pulmonologist at discharge.  Her dose was decreased to
5 mg po daily at discharge.
.
#. R Femeral Groin Infection: Pt is s/p R SFA thrombectomy, R
CFA/EIA endarterectomy, RLE fasciotomy [**7-19**] by vasuclar surgery.
 The wound was infected on prior admission and cultures grew
pseudomonas.  She was placed on Cefepime 2g q24 until [**9-13**] at
which point she will follow-up with vascular. Pt without
leukocytosis and afebrile.  She had a wound vac placed by
vascular surgery, and will need that kept in place until she is
seen by the vascular surgeons as scheduled on [**9-13**].  Xeroform
should be placed on the wound prior to application of the wound
vac, due to underlying vasculature.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: s/p PPM for tachy/brady syndrome. Pt
with episodes of RVR on prior admission.  She is not on
anti-coagulation given h/o GI bleed. She is on amiodarone and
metoprolol.  Amio was continued as per home regimen.   She is
now on low dose aspirin for stroke prevention.  Her pacemaker
was interrogated and functioning well. She will need a device
check in 1 month.
.
#. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: Last ECHO revealed EF of 45%.
 The patient is on lasix 40mg at home. Patient appears euvolemic
to dry on
