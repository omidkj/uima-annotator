PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vitals showed a blood
pressure of 190/110, pulse 120, respiratory rate 20, oxygen
saturation 99% on room air.  In general, the patient appeared
her stated age, lying in bed, breathing heavily, with eyes
closed and head turned to the right.  The head was
normocephalic, atraumatic, with sclerae white, oropharynx
clear, mucous membranes moist.  The neck was supple, with no
bruits.  The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally on
anterior auscultation.  Cardiac examination revealed a normal
S1 and S2, tachycardic, with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
The abdomen was soft, with some mild right lower quadrant
tenderness, normal bowel sounds.  The extremities were warm,
with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION:  Revealed the patient to be lethargic
but opening her eyes halfway to voice and briefly orients her
head toward the voice.  She closes her eyes after 45 seconds.
Can state her name, and denies being in any pain.  She
follows simple commands such as, "Open your eyes,"
inconsistently, with a brief period of arousal followed by
somnolence.  The few words she states show largely intact
articulation.  Cranial nerve examination showed her face to
be symmetric, with possible bilateral ptosis.  The eyes are
deviated to the right but could briefly look to the left.
Fixation is interrupted by roving eye movements.  Funduscopic
examination limited by movement.  Pupils equal at 2 mm, but
minimally reactive to light directly.  Motor examination:  In
general, spontaneously moving right arm more than left.  4+
power of right arm major muscle groups.  Left triceps is 4,
biceps 4+, wrist flexors and extensors 2, finger extensors
4-, grip 4.  Legs are difficult to assess because of
cooperation, but right iliopsoas is at least 3, left is [**2-10**].
Can dorsiflex bilateral ankles against gravity.  Reflexes:
Biceps 2+ bilaterally, triceps absent bilaterally, brachial
radialis 1+ bilaterally, patellar 1+ on the left, absent on
the right.  Achilles absent bilaterally, left toes upgoing,
right toes downgoing.  Sensory examination:  She quickly
withdraws and localizes pain on the right, but less so on the
left arm, although she grimaces to the left leg.

LABORATORY DATA:  BUN 23, creatinine 1.9, glucose 127.  White
count 13.7, INR 1.7.  Head CT:  Right 2.1 x 2.1 cm posterior
thalamic hemorrhage without extension.  Chest x-ray:
Cardiomegaly, vascular congestion more on the right, with
perihilar fullness.  Electrocardiogram:  Rapid atrial
fibrillation with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in Lead I and lateral
leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On presentation to [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Department, the patient was found to
be slightly hypertensive to the 150s and in rapid atrial
fibrillation to the 110s.  She was admitted to the Neurology
Intensive Care Unit after she was noted to have a right
thalamic bleed.  Coumadin was discontinued, and her blood
pressure was kept less than 160/95.  She had some mild fluid
overload on chest x-ray, and was kept on lasix.  She also was
given a beta blocker for rate control.

Lethargy persisted while on the unit, as well as dysarthria.
She was transferred to the Neuromedicine floor the night of
[**2199-10-14**].  On [**2199-10-15**], the patient went for a repeat head CT
and video swallow study.  On return, she was found to be
tachycardic in the 120s, all the way up to the 160s.  She was
hypertensive initially to 180 to 200/100 to 125.  She was
dyspneic and complained of "chest pain" which localized to
the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  Additionally, her
oxygen saturation was 95% on 5 liters, changed from 90% on 1
liter.  The lungs had crackles at the bases bilaterally with
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.  Cardiac examination
showed her to be in tachycardia and atrial fibrillation,
without an apparent S3.  An arterial blood gas was done, with
a pH of 7.5, PO2 of 60, PCO2 of 23.  The AA gradient was
calculated as 61.

The patient's rate was controlled with intravenous and oral
metoprolol as well as lasix.  Chest x-ray showed increased
congestive heart failure at this time.  Cardiac enzymes were
cycled and were found to be negative.  Cardiology was
consulted and intravenous Diltiazem was pushed, which
eventually brought down her blood pressure to 120/65 and her
heart rate to the 70s and 80s.

The following day, lower extremity Dopplers showed no
evidence of deep venous thrombosis.  Her chest x-ray was read
as having free air in the abdomen, and KUB was done which
also showed free air in the abdomen.  A chest CT was done
which showed a small right lower lobe pulmonary embolism as
well.  Heparin was not started, as the patient had free air
in her abdomen and had a recent thalamic bleed.  A TTE was
performed, which showed an ejection fraction of 25 to 30%,
with nearly global hypokinesis.  An ACE inhibitor and Digoxin
were started that day.  In the evening, an abdominal CT was
done, which showed diverticulitis with a perforated viscera.
General Surgery was consulted, however, the patient and
family both agreed that they did not want to pursue surgical
options at this time.  They also asked that no central venous
lines be placed, however, the following day they did agree to
the placement of a PICC line, as the patient was made nothing
by mouth and all of her medications were switched to
intravenous formulations.

The patient was treated for her bowel perforation with bowel
rest and intravenous antibiotics.  Levofloxacin,
metronidazole and ampicillin were all started in the early
morning hours of [**2199-10-17**].  On the 13th to the [**11-22**], the patient became more conversant with the staff
and her daughter.  The issue of treatment was readdressed
during this time, and the patient remained firm in her
conviction of having no surgical treatment, but to continue
antibiotic therapy.

On the evening of the 14th, thickened clear liquids were
started, and the patient tolerated them fairly well, however,
the following day she had a recurrence of mild abdominal
pain.  The next day, however, the abdominal pain was gone.
The patient had also been passing flatus and was reported to
have had a bowel movement.  Nectar-thick
