Pertinent Results:
[**2129-1-6**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed, with
akinetic inferior wall and apex(LVEF= 20 %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-CPB: 1. Improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systiolic function with
persistent wall m otion abnmormalities (EF =30%) (Background
epinephrine infusion)
2. No change in valve structuer and function.

[**2129-1-10**] Head CT: There is no evidence of acute intracranial
pathology. Mucosal thickening is noted in the sphenoid and left
maxillary sinus, focal defect is noted on the left lamina
papyracea, of uncertain chronicity. Punctate calcifications are
visualized in the vertebral arteries and both carotid siphons.

[**2129-1-18**] Echo: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears depressed.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2129-1-22**] CXR: Severe cardiomegaly is stable postoperatively and
comparable to the preoperative appearance. There is no
appreciable atelectasis and no pleural effusion or pulmonary
edema. Prominent nipple shadow should not be mistaken for lung
nodules. No pneumothorax. Right PIC line ends in the region of
the superior cavoatrial junction.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 55-year-old patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy who
presented with exertional symptoms and was investigated and
found to have a very low ejection fraction of 10%-15%. The
coronary angiogram showed significant disease in the left
anterior descending artery, the right coronary artery, and the
distal circumflex artery. A perfusion scan demonstrated
reversible ischemic areas. He was admitted for elective coronary
artery bypass grafting. In view of the low ejection fraction,
the plan was to proceed with pump-assisted, beating-heart
coronary artery bypass grafting. He was brought to the operating
room on [**2129-1-6**] where the he underwent pump-assisted,
beating-heart coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and
saphenous vein sequential grafting to posterior descending
artery and posterior left ventricular branch. Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. On POD 2 he was walking to the bathroom and became
unresponsive upon return to the chair. He was found to be in PEA
and code blue was called. Compressions were initiated and he was
coded with a return of blood pressure and spontaneous rhythm
after epinephrine and atropine. He was intubated for airway
protection and transferred to the CVICU. He remained
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic support but was slow to
wake. Head CT was done [**1-11**] which was negative for any acute
event. On [**1-12**] he was consistently following commands and was
extubated without incident. He was hypertensive after extubation
and medications were titrated up for goal SBP <130. Coreg and
Ace-I were initiated with low EF. He had a swallow evaluation
which he passed for regular diet with thin liquids. He did have
some confusion and agitation which improved with Haldol. Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
On [**1-17**] he was transferred again to the step down unit.
Echocardiogram was done to reassess EF which showed LVEF of 30%.
EP evaluated patient on [**1-19**] for his PEA arrest and
recommendations for follow-up in future. They recommended an
outpatient AICD evaluation in 1 month. The patient was evaluated
by the physical and occupational therapy services for assistance
with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 18
the patient was ambulating with assistance (with a left drift),
the wound was healing well and pain was controlled with Tylenol.
The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 86**] in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
