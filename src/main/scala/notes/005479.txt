Admission Date:  [**2140-2-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2140-2-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2090-7-7**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 49-year-old male with
past medical history of scleroderma (limited systemic sclerosis -
CREST syndrome) and NYHA Class IIIB-IV pulmonary hypertension, on
Flolan since [**2139-5-21**], CHF thought to be secondary to
diastolic dysfunction versus related to pulmonary hypertension,
who presented on [**2140-2-4**] status post right heart catheterization
after reporting a several week history of increasing shortness of
breath and dyspnea with exertion.

Patient had been stable on outpatient regimen of Flolan 75 cc per
24 hours, Bumex, aldactone, Zaroxolyn, and IV Lasix boluses since
last discharged in [**2139-11-21**].  However, for the past two
weeks, he has noted increasing dyspnea.  He had attempted to self
titrate his Flolan at home without relief. In response to his
symptoms, he underwent echocardiogram as an outpatient.
Echocardiogram on [**2140-2-2**] demonstrated mildly dilated left
atrium, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.  The
right ventricle was moderately dilated with moderate global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  There is abnormal septal
motion in position consistent with right ventricular pressure,
volume overload, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation was noted.  There was
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There was
also moderate sized pericardial effusion, which was
circumferential, but with no signs of tamponade other than
brief right atrial collapse.

He was referred into the hospital by his primary pulmonologist
for right heart catheterization, and titration of his Flolan.
Right heart catheterization showed a mean pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 8 (earlier measurements raised possibility of
PCW = 27, but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] reviewed tracings and felt PCW = 8 more
accurate), mean right atrial pressure of 5, pulmonary artery
pressure of 69/12, right ventricle pressure of 68/4.
Demonstrated normal right and left sided filling pressures.
Cardiac output was relatively preserved at 5.52 liters per
minute.  Pulmonary vascular resistance was increased at 421.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was increased compared
with prior catheterizations when he had been on higher Flolan
doses.

Status post right heart catheterization, he was transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring as
well as titration of his Flolan.  While in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, the Swan-Ganz catheter remained in place for
continuous monitoring.  He had a trial of sildenafil 25 mg
p.o. t.i.d. which demonstrated a drop in his pulmonary artery
pressure of approximately 10%, demonstrated increased cardiac
output, and a slight drop in his systolic blood pressure.
However, he had difficulty tolerating the sildenafil
secondary to severe headache.  Also while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, his Flolan was titrated up to a dose of
23 ng/kg/minute.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Scleroderma with CREST syndrome diagnosed approximately 20
years ago due to sclerodactyly.  Associated pulmonary
hypertension, on Flolan since [**2139-5-21**].  Pulmonary

lung capacity 49% predicted, residual volume 60% predicted,
and DLCO of 28% predicted.
2. History of right pleural effusions status post
thoracentesis in [**2139-12-21**], which revealed a mildly

11. Congestive heart failure diagnosed in [**2139-11-21**].
Echocardiogram in [**2140-2-2**] with mildly dilated LA, left
ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, right
ventricle moderately dilated with moderate global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  There is abnormal septal
motion and position consistent with right ventricle pressure
and volume overload.  One plus tricuspid regurgitation.
Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  A moderate
sized pericardial effusion, circumferential, with no signs of
tamponade, but brief right atrial collapse.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES, X-RAYS, AND OTHER STUDIES:
Laboratories on transfer showed complete blood cell count
with WBC 9.5, hematocrit 30.7, platelets 196.  Serum
chemistries demonstrate sodium 132, potassium 4.1, chloride
92, bicarbonate 35, BUN 23, creatinine 1.2, glucose 108,
calcium 9.1, phosphorus 4.4, magnesium 1.7.

Chest x-ray showed paracentral increase in densities, but
bilateral effusions consistent with pulmonary edema.

Chest CT from [**2140-2-2**] demonstrated diffuse central lobular
ground-glass opacities with smoothly thickened septal lines.
There was band-like areas of probable atelectasis at the
bases bilaterally.  There were moderate sized right pleural
effusions, which had increased in size compared with previous
studies.  There was prominence of the pulmonary artery.
There were minimal reticular opacities at the extreme left
base.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Dyspnea:  Patient's dyspnea was felt to be secondary to
worsening pulmonary hypertension.  While he was in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit, he had his Flolan dose titrated
up to 23 ng/kg/minute.  He also underwent a trial of
sildenafil for nitric oxide mediated dilatory effects,
however, this resulted in severe headache and patient was
unable to tolerate sildenafil.

After he failed his trial of sildenafil, we attempted to
titrate up his Flolan dose while on the floor.  However, he
did not tolerate the increased Flolan dose secondary to
dizziness, headache, and nausea.  He also underwent
esophageal balloon studies under the hypothesis that perhaps
some component of his dyspnea was due to chest wall
restriction secondary to scleroderma.  However, his
esophageal balloon st
