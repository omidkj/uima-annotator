Brief Hospital Course:
1. MRSA Bacteremia - Pt has WBC of 22 and 21% bands with dirty
UA. He received Vanc/Cefepime in the ED as empiric coverage.  He
was tachycardic to 120s and febrile to 104, indicating SIRS.
Lactate decreased from 5.3 to 1.5 after volume resusitation.
Tunnelled catheter removed and cultured, blood cultures also
done, both of which came back positive for MRSA.  Antibiotic
coverage narrowed to MRSA.  The patient was transfered to the
MICU on [**7-25**] in DKA (see below) and continued to have positive
blood cultures.  He spiked a temperature to 103 on [**7-28**], his LIJ
was pulled and cultured, which returned negative and he was
transferred to the floor.  Gentamicin was started on [**7-29**] for
synergy with Vancomycin.  ID consult on [**7-30**] confirmed the
combination of Vancomycin and Gentamicin.  He received a TEE on
[**8-1**] which was negative for endocarditis.  Ultimately, the
Gentamicin was d/c'd and the patient was continued on Vancomycin
for a total of 4 weeks per ID recs (started [**7-24**]).  The patient
was given a PIC line on [**8-6**] to enable Vancomycin dosing through
the PIC line.
.
2.  DKA - The patient had extant DM1 diagnosis.  His increased
metabolic needs and stress from infection were thought to
contribute to spiking sugars.  The patient went into DKA on [**7-26**]
and was transfered to the MICU.  In the MICU, he was bolussed
with fluids and started on an insulin drip.  He was weaned off
the insulin drip at 9pm on [**7-27**], and transfered to the floor on
[**7-28**] at noon.  On the floor, his bicarbonate, blood sugars, and
ketones were monitored closely out of concern for new episode of
DKA.  He maintained a bicarb of 18-21 with ketones
small-moderate.  His blood sugars proved difficult to manage
(200s) due to the combination of stress from infection and the
patient's changing diet.  Often, he would not eat meals because
he disliked the renal/diabetic diet.  Ultimately, this diet was
changed to cardiac diet, which encouraged the patient to take
POs.  [**Last Name (un) **] ok'd sugar soda.  Pt had three episodes of
hypoglycemia through the rest of his hospital course, all
treated with amps of D50 and POs.  He was put back on no sugar
drinks and blood glucose remained steady in 100s.  [**Last Name (un) **] Fellow
was following the patient and his recs were implemented daily,
titrating Lantus qdinner dose from 30 units-->25-->15 before
discharge.
.
3. ?Pneumonia: The patient [**7-29**] CXR was read as containing
possible R lobar opacity.  He also had a worsening clinical lung
exam.  There was concern for possible developing pneumonia,
particularly Pseudomonas (which was not covered by his Vanc/Gent
regimen).  The patient was given Cefepime 1g IV ONCE and ID was
consulted.  The patient's [**7-30**] CXR was unchanged from [**7-29**] and the
lobar opacity deemed similar to one from a CXR taken on [**12-2**].
ID recs therefore recommended holding the Cefepime.
.
4. Renal Transplant/CKD: Patient admitted s/p failed kidney
transplant, having begun HD 2 weeks prior.  Upon admission, his
creatinine was 3.6, elevated on [**7-24**] to 4.5, and got as high as
6.3 on [**7-27**].  His Sirolimus was held and the patient was dosed
with Prednisone 5mg QD.  He was dialyzed on [**7-27**] through a
temporary LIJ, which was subsequently pulled on [**7-28**] when the
patient spiked another temperature.  Renal transplant determined
that the patient would not recover his kidney function, so the
patient was cleared to receive Gentamicin.  However, beginning
on [**7-28**], his creatinine began trending downwards.  Given the
patient's continued sepicemia, it was deemed preferable not to
place a temporary line for dialysis unless necessary.
Therefore,  the decision for dialysis was made on a daily basis.
  His renal function improved daily from his stepdown from the
ICU through his hospital course, plateauing at 1.7 on [**8-11**].
Ultimately, renal determined that the patient would not need HD
at this time and could go home without a tunnel catheter.
Throughout his hospitalization, he received Prednisone 5mg
DAILY, his potassium kept above 3.4, and his medications were
all renally dosed.
.
5. Urine Fungemia:  The patient had positive UCx speciated for
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17939**] on previous hospitalization, for which he
received Voriconazole.  His [**7-25**] UCx also came back positive for
yeast but was nonspeciated.  Per ID recs, it was decided to hold
off on treatment until results could be corroborated by [**7-29**] Ucx.
 [**7-29**] UCx ultimately returned positive for C. [**Month/Day (4) 17939**], and the
