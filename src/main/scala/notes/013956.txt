History of Present Illness:
63 y/o M w/ h/o CHF now transferred for decompensated heart
failure and inotropic assisted diuresis. By report from OSH
patient patient had a 15 lb weight gain prior to admission with
increased dyspnea and non-productive cough. Outpatient
physicians attempted to increase her diuretics but were unable
to successfully mitigate her weight gain. As such she presented
to OSH on [**2144-4-7**].

Initial impression was for systolic CHF and patient was given
lasix IV. Pressures dropped to 90s with lasix, however. By
report her ECG was NSR with RBBB morphology and no significant
ST/T wave changes. At the OSH, cardiology consultation
recommended a dose reduction in her carvedilol and initiated low
dose ACE. Consideration was given to ICU transfer for dopamine
assisted diuresis, but consultation with CHF service lead to
referral to [**Hospital1 18**] for milrinone assisted diuresis.

Patient is poor historian. Reports dyspnea with minimal exertion
for some time, and increasing edema. Endorses PND/orthopnea at
home. Denies fevers/chills sick contacts, recent travel or other
new complaints.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

On arrival, initial VS were: T95, BP 70/47, HR 52, RR 20, O2 98%

IMAGING:

Echocardiogram, transthoracic [**2144-4-13**]: The left atrium is mildly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal third of
the ventricle with an aneurysmal apex. There is mild hypokinesis
of the remaining segments (LVEF = 30 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild [1+] mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with apical
anerysm and near akinesis of the distal left ventricle. Markedly
dilated right ventricle with free wall hypokinesis. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

Echocardiogram, transesophageal [**2144-4-17**]: No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
