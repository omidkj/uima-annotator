Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10370**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachypnea, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
61 yo Russian-speaking man w/anoxic brain injury and with hx of

DMI, s/p cadaveric kidney transplant([**2175**]), h/o CVA and chronic

aspiration (multiple admissions for aspiration PNA - last [**3-19**]),

CABG in [**2170**], widespread tracheomalacia with trach stent, and
recent admission to the ICU from [**Date range (2) 21579**] for PNA, stent
removal and tracheostomy.  He was treated for aspiration PNA
with Vanc, Levo, Flagyl and then switched to Cefepime and
Azithro to complete a 10 day course.  He was also given Cipro x
7 days for a UTI.  He was discharged with a dobhoff feeding tube
and on tube feeds.  He was found today at rehab to be hypoxic to
the mid-80s. Suction was attempted but did not show improvement
and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T100.4 HR102 BP163/93 RR24 O2sat96.
Patient was given Vanc, Cefepime, Azithro and Solumedrol 125mg
IV x 1.  He was given Kayexalate PR for potassium of 5.7 and
aspirin for troponin of 0.62.  He was seen by IP due to possible
air leak as he was pulling tidal volumes of 200.  The plan was
to replace his trach once in the ICU.
.
On the floor, he appears comfortable, unable to answer
questions, not following commands.


Past Medical History:
- Cadaveric renal transplant in [**2175**]
- CVA-residual right hemiparesis
- DM Type I
- HTN
- Hx non-QMI and Vfib arrest [**2169**] with anoxic brain injury
- CAD/CABG [**2170**]
- Swallow study-showed silent aspiration
- hx of aspiration pneumonia
- tracheomalacia after long intubation requiring trach stent and
button complicated by site cellulitis and granulation tissue
requiring cryoptherapy.


Social History:
Lives with wife. Former endocrinologist in [**Country 532**]. Has homemaker
who comes in 5 times a week. Has 3 daughters who visit him.


Family History:
No history of lung disease


Physical Exam:
General: Awake, in no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Course breath sounds bilaterally, left sided rhonchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: + foley with brown sediment
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema


Pertinent Results:
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and
apical septal akinesis/dyskinesis. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-11-16**],
left ventricular sysotlic function is now more significantly
impaired. Focal apical septal hypokinesis was present
previously. Inferolateral /inferior akinesis is new (there may
have mild inferior hypokinesis previously).
.
.
CXR:
BEDSIDE FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: Bilateral airspace
opacities which are more confluent in the left lung, worrisome
for pneumonia. Distended azygous contour, could represent volume
overload with part of the RUL opacity representing early edema.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size is
normal. Median sternotomy wire and mediastinal clips from prior
CABG are present. Tracheostomy tube is in standard location with
the tip terminating 3 cm above the carina.
.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal pneumonia with mild volume overload.

Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2182-5-27**]


FINDINGS: Despite repeated image acquisition, the study is
limited by patient motion. Hyperdensity projecting over the left
inferolateral frontal lobe (3:20) is likely a bone-related
artifact in the setting of motion. Otherwise, there is no
evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema or
major vascular territorial infarct. The prominent ventricles and
sulci are unchanged in size or configuration. There is no shift
of normally midline structures. Moderate periventricular and
subcortical white matter hypodensities are compatible with known
chronic microvascular ischemic disease. Lacunar infarct
