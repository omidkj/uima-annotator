Stools Studies:
   FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2109-3-19**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA
FOUND.

   CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2109-3-19**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER
FOUND.

   OVA + PARASITES (Final [**2109-3-19**]):
      NO OVA AND PARASITES SEEN.
      This test does not reliably detect Cryptosporidium,
Cyclospora or
      Microsporidium. While most cases of Giardia are detected
by routine
      O+P, the Giardia antigen test may enhance detection when
organisms
      are rare.

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2109-3-17**]):
      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).

Blood Cultures from [**2109-3-16**]-pending at the time of discharge

CXR [**2108-3-16**]
FINDINGS: Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was
obtained.
Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema is again seen. Difficult to
exclude
underlying pleural effusions. The cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes are
stable. There has been interval placement of a large-bore
left-sided
catheter, distal tip not optimally seen, but likely terminates
in the
cavoatrial junction/right atrium.
