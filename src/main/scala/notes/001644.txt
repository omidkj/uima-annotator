HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
male with past medical history significant for CHF, atrial
fibrillation, and cardiomyopathy who presents with left lower
extremity cellulitis and hematoma.  The patient bumped his
left shin with a suitcase approximately 6 days prior to
admission.  He then developed a focal hematoma, which
progressively increased in size over the next few days.  He
saw his PCP 4 days prior to admission, he was concerned for
concurrent cellulitis.  He was started on Keflex to cover for
cellulitis and also Vicodin for pain.  The patient
subsequently noted a decrease in his hematoma size.  Today,
he went to see his cardiologist, who was concerned given the
significant hematoma size and concurrent cellulitis and
referred him to the Emergency Department to be admitted for
IV antibiotics.  The patient does complain of shin pain
localizing to the hematoma site.  He denies any distal
weakness or any sensory deficits.  No fevers or chills.  He
does note his INR was noted to be supratherapeutic this week,
at which point his Coumadin dose was decreased.  At the time
of presentation in the Emergency Department, the patient was
afebrile with vital signs stable.  He was started on IV Ancef
following attainment of blood cultures.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Afebrile,
temperature 97.3 degrees, blood pressure 116/50, pulse 62,
and respirations 20.  GENERAL:  An elder male sitting in bed
in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx
clear.  Two punctate lesions on roof of mouth.  No vesicles
or focal bleeding.  NECK:  Soft and supple, no JVD.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Irregular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation, equal bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:
Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Left shin with an
approximately 4 cm circumferential hematoma with surrounding
erythema and 2 plus pitting edema.  NEUROLOGIC:  Strength 5/5
in bilateral lower extremities, although left lower extremity
exam limited secondary to pain.  Sensation intact.  Nonfocal
neurologic exam.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.6, hematocrit 35.2, platelets
337, with a differential of 70 neutrophils, 20 lymphs, 5
monocytes, and 4 eosinophils.  PT 25.8, PTT 36.7 with an INR
of 4.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cellulitis:  The patient with left lower
extremity hematoma occurring in the setting of
supratherapeutic INR.  He then developed a secondary
cellulitis.  At the time of admission, he had been on 4 days
of oral antibiotics as an outpatient with failure to clear
his infection.  He was started on IV Ancef at the time of
admission.  Blood cultures were obtained, which remained
negative.  He was continued on IV antibiotics throughout the
admission as his hematoma issues were treated and addressed.
The surrounding erythema did resolve, and his edema markedly
improved.  On the day of discharge, he was then converted
over to oral antibiotics to complete a 7-day course of
Keflex.

Hematoma:  The patient with left shin hematoma, which did
occur in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
Anticoagulation was held at the time of admission.  Given the
lack of resolution of hematoma and concern for a concurrent
cellulitis, in addition to functional deficits due to
immobility due to pain, a Vascular Surgery consult was
obtained to evaluate the hematoma.  He was taken to the OR
for evacuation.  He tolerated this procedure well without any
complications.  However, several hours after the procedure,
he did have extensive bleeding from the hematoma site.  The
wound was compressed and pressure dressings were applied with
subsequent control of bleeding.  He remained in-house several
days after this to ensure hemodynamic stability.  He was then
discharged to home with plan to follow up in [**Hospital **] Clinic
in the next week.  He also will have VNA for continued
dressing changes and wound care.

Atrial fibrillation/AVR:  The patient was admitted with
diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and a recent AVR, for which
he takes Coumadin.  His INR was noted to be supratherapeutic
at the time of admission.  This was thought to be due to a
recent dose adjustment in his Coumadin with over aggressive
titration of his Coumadin dose.  Coumadin was initially held
as per above.  He was then restarted on this the day of
admission.  He was on VNA at home to monitor his INR.

CHF:  The patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy, CHF with an
EF of 35 percent.  He had no clinical evidence of failure
during this hospitalization.  He was maintained on beta-
blocker, ACE, Bumex and digoxin as per his home regimen.  His
inputs, outputs, and weights were followed, and he was
maintained on a cardiac diet with fluid restriction.  CHF
Service did see him while he was in-house and felt he was
doing well on his current regimen.

SVT:  The patient with AICD defibrillator in place.  He did
have a short run of an SVT, an approximately 6-beat run, for
which he was asymptomatic while in-house.  The EP team did
come by and interrogate his pacemaker and felt that it was
functioning well.  He will follow up as an outpatient in [**Hospital **]
Clinic.
