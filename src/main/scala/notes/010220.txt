History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 17**] [**Known lastname 22627**] is a 89 year old woman with history of asthma
and HTN who presents to the OSH after being found down in her
home.  Patient was found by her daughter in her bathroom.  She
was awake and conversant but was unable to state how she ended
up on the ground and how long she had been there.  Her daughter
reports last talking to her mother on the evening of [**7-28**] and
that patient did not endorse any complaints or health concerns.
EMS was called and brought her to an OSH.
.
In the OSH she underwent CT head which showed a subacute
subdural hemorrhage with slight midline shift. Patient was also
found to have elevated calcium of 14.2 for which she was given
several liters of normal saline and intranasal calcitonin.
After her CT head she became increasingly more somnolent to the
point that she was unresponsive to painful stimuli.  She was
pretreated with etomidate and vecuronium and intubated.  After
intubation she experienced hypotension and was given epi [**12-14**]
amp, 2 L normal saline, dilantin load, and ceftriaxone 1 g IV.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED her vital signs were .  Neurosurgery and
trauma teams were consulted. Her EKG on arrival was concerning
for new ST elevations in V1 and V2. A CODE STEMI was called.
Decision was made that patient's current comorbidities did not
make her a candidate for urgent catheterization. Repeat EKGs
showed some resolution of ST elevations. A left CVL was placed.
She received empiric vancomycin 1 g IV, levofloxacin 750 mg IV,
flagyl 250 mg IV, and 4 L NS IV prior to transfer to the ICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old woman found down with a rapidly deteriorating mental
status and septic shock physiology with a positive urinalysis.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU the patient??????s blood pressure began to
drop. She required continuous IVF delivered wide open via 2
lines simultaneously without adequate blood pressure response.
Pressors were started. Even with continuous IVF boluses,
neosynephrine and levophed the patient maintained only
borderline pressures.  Her lactate continued to increase and her
urine output declined.  She remained unresponsive to pain.  Her
daughter [**Name (NI) 1785**] was called and it was recommended that she come
to the hospital if possible.

Goals of care were discussed with the patient's daughter (health
care proxy).  She stated that the patient would want everything
done if it would definitely bring her back to the quality of
life that she had before.  She stated the patient would want to
be able to return to her home and live independently as she has.
 When I expressed to her daughter that this outcome could not be
guaranteed and based on her current clinical status would be
very unlikely, she stated that her mother would not want to
continue with aggressive treatment.  She stated that if her
mother was not able to interact that she would not want to be
kept alive by any artificial means.   The decision was made to
pursue comfort measures only.  The daughter and her husband did
not want to be at the bedside if her mother passed. The patient
had become increasingly edematous due to aggressive volume
resuscition.  The decision was made to discontinue IV fluids.
At this time her blood pressures could not be sustained.
Pressors were discontinued and patient became pulseless.

I was called to the bedside at 9:40am to evaluate the patient.
She was unresponsive without response to pain or corneal reflex.
 She had no heart sounds and no audible blood pressure.  She was
pronounced dead at 9:47 and extubated.  Her daughter was called
and instructed that due to the short duration of hospitalization
and the recent trauma that the medical examiner will have to be
notified of her mother??????s death.  The daughter declined elective
autopsy but expressed understanding that there may be policies
in place that would require a post-mortem examination.
