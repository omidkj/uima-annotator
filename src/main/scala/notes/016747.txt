Abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
47 year old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer
and two prior episodes of pancreatitis thought to be secondary
to hypertriglyceridemia who presents with abdominal pain. The
patient was in her usual state of health until this morning when
she began to feel epigastric abdominal pain, associated with
nausea and vomiting. Does not report hematemesis or diarrhea.
She denies recent fever, chills, head ache, chest pain, back
pain, sob, cough.

Patient had a similar episode one month ago and one in [**2130**]. She
denies history of EtOH use and had CCY in [**2132**] with no
subsequent history of gallstones. She is on a new course of
chemo (Navelbine and Neuslasta).

Past Medical History:

metastatic breast cancer

onc hx:
Primary Onc: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
Metastatic Breast ca- in past, undewent chemo w/
adriamycin/cytoxan, then taxol. Then, she received
5FU/leukovorin and Zometa. Her course has been complicated by
compression fractures in T1-T6 and T9.  She underwent radiation
treatment for T1 and developed more pain and T6 then was found
to have a compression fracture with cord compression. She was
hospitalized while she started radiation treatment. The decision
had initially been made to continue her chemotherapy through her
radiation treatment as a radiation sensitizer; however, the
patient had episodes of severe nausea and vomiting and diarrhea
resulting in additional  hospitalizations. She is finishing off
her radiation treatments with the omission of 5-FU leucovorin.
She was restarted weekly taxol on [**2137-5-23**] until [**9-30**].  Pt was
switched to gemzar since [**10-22**] due to apparent progression of
disease. CT on [**10-18**] showed progression in size of liver mets and
development of new right sided pulmonary nodules. PET [**10-21**]
showed widespread metastatic bone lesions which were stable in
intensity and number.

Social History:
Lives with her husband and 3 children in [**Location (un) 1459**]. She works as
a radiology tech as [**Hospital3 2576**]. She denies any EtOH use, drug
use or smoking.


Family History:
Aunt with breast cancer on father's side. Mother with bladder
cancer. Uncle with unknown type of cancer.

Imaging:
CXR ([**2138-1-24**]): Lungs are clear without infiltrate, effusion,
or pneumothorax.
Abdominal CT ([**2138-1-25**]): Marked peripancreatic inflammatory
change, with free fluid in the retroperitoneum, and extending
into the pelvis. Findings compatible with known history of
pancreatitis. No loculated fluid collection, pancreatic
necrosis, or vascular complications identified. Stable hepatic
and osseous metastases.
MRCP ([**2138-1-27**]): Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater
than right, extensive peripancreatic inflammatory change without
evidence of
pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation. Normal appearance
of the biliary tree and pancreatic duct, stable appearance of
multiple hepatic metastases, diffuse fatty infiltration of
liver.
[**2137-1-29**]
Rib Film ([**2138-1-29**]): No definite lytic or sclerotic rib or
shoulder metastases identified. Bone scan is recommended for
further evaluation due to its greater sensitivity for detection
for metastases. Small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe
atelectasis.
Bone scan: ([**2138-1-31**])
Numerous metastatic bone lesions as described above which are
stable
compared to the most recent prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 female with metastatic breast cancer and two prior episodes
of pancreatitis (98 and [**11-30**]) thought to be to be secondary to
hypertriglyceridemia admitted for acute pancreatitis most likely
secondary to hypertriglyceridemia v. chemotherapy.

1) Pancreatitis:
In the ED ([**2139-1-25**]) the patient reported diffuse abdominal
pain, nausea and vomiting. Her amylase (825), lipase (2113) and
WBC (32.2) were all elevated. Abdominal CT showed marked
peripancreatic inflammatory change, with free fluid in the
retroperitoneum, and extending into the pelvis. No loculated
fluid collection, pancreatic necrosis, or vascular complications
were identified. The radiological findings, lab values and
patient's presentation was compatible with pancreatitis, and she
was subsequently admitted to medicine for acute pancreatitis
believed secondary to hypertriglyceridemia v. chemotherapy. She
was given morphine for pain, put on bowel rest with continued
agressive IV hydration. The evening after admission, the patient
had MS changes, became tachycardic to 150's, required increased
IVF and had rectal temp to 103.8. She was subsequently
transferred to the MICU for closer observation. In the MICU, she
reported LUQ pain which was initally attributed to pancreatitis
(See discussion below). MRCP showed extensive peripancreatic
inflammatory change without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or
pseudocyst formation. The pancreatic duct and biliary tree
appeared normal. Metastases were unchanged from prior studies.
Patient's WBC, amylase and lipase continued to trend downwards,
but she continued to have intermittant fevers (see discussion
below). She was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] for continued management. A
PICC line was placed for TPN and later removed (see discussion
below). At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile and
WBC, amylase and lipase were wnl and she was on only PO pain
meds. She was able to tolerate soft solids.

2) LUQ/left lower rib pain:
Thiswas most likely secondary to pleural irritation due to
pancreatitis. Rib films and bone scan swere negative for
fractures or rib mestases that could be contributing to her
pain, CTA was negative for PE, and, although CT scan showed
small bilateral pleural effusion, their low volume prevented
thoracentesis. The patient was initially started on a dilaudid
PCA Dilaudid, from which she was transitioned to Oxycontin,
hydromorphone, and gabapentin. At time of discharge, her pain
was adequately controlled.
.
3)Bacteremia:
Blood cultures from [**2138-1-30**] (resulted [**2138-2-1**]) grew two
morphologies of coag (-) staph (1/4 bottles). These were
believed to be a contaminant, but given the patient remained
febrile, she was begun o
