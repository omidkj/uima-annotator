PERTINENT IMAGING:
pCXR [**2150-8-25**]
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently
of [**2150-8-17**].

FINDINGS:  Single frontal portable view of the chest was
obtained.  The heart is enlarged and its right border is
silhouetted by right lung base
consolidation, which is increased since [**2150-8-17**] and
compatible with
pneumonia, pleural effusion, or a combination of both.  The left
lung is
clear.  No pneumothorax is identified.  A right central catheter
terminates in the low SVC.  Left humeral hardware is similar to
prior and right humeral hardware is incompletely imaged.

IMPRESSION:  Right lung base parenchymal opacity, increased
since prior,
compatible with pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
Probable
superimposed right pleural effusion.
