Chief Complaint:
Symptoms: SOB, weight gain, lethargy
Procedures: Right/Left Heart Cath, ICD hematoma


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD hematoma evacuation
Cardiac Catheritization


History of Present Illness:
59 yr old patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with familial
cardiomyopathy, afib, ASD closure as a child, AFIB w/complete
heart block, s/p BIV ICD with recent Generator change c/b pocket
hematoma. Per sign out he is scheduled for RHC on Monday for
heart transplant evaluation.
.
He was admitted pre-procedurally, for potential diuresis, and
possible evacuation of a pocket hematoma.
.
The patient has been is USOH, with notable fatigue and decreased
energy recently. He had what was presumed to have several GI
bleeds in the past few months, and received multiple
transfusions. In the last few weeks he has been sleeping more,
with a decrease in his functional status. He has noted increased
DOE, which has acutely become worse over the past month. He also
has an ICD hematoma which has not been evacuated.

Positive ROS: calf claudication, 50 lb weight loss
(unintentional).  Negative ROS: No recent F/C/night sweats,
nausea, emesis, BRBPR, diarrhea, or melena.
.
On review of systems, He denies any prior history of stroke,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Studies:
Chest X-ray
INDICATION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and renal insufficiency.
Evaluate
pleural effusion.
COMPARISON: Chest radiographs from [**2157-2-10**].
FINDINGS: The left pacemaker generator has been replaced. The
right
ventricular and coronary sinus pacer leads are unchanged in
position. There
is a new large pacer pocket hematoma or infection with
associated left
anterior chest wall swelling. The moderate right pleural
effusion has
dramatically increased and fluid is seen tracking up the
incomplete right
major fissure. There is no left pleural effusion. Moderate
cardiomegaly is
unchanged. The mediastinal contours are normal. There is
persistent right
basilar atelectasis. Persistent vascular congestion is present.
No
pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. New pacer pocket hematoma vs. infection.
2. Dramatically increased moderate right pleural effusion.
3. Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.
4. Unchanged right basilar atelectasis.
.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND
CLINICAL INDICATION: Ascites, cardiac cirrhosis.
COMPARISON STUDY: [**2157-2-8**].
Once again, the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava are
markedly dilated, and the portal vein flow is forward, but
pulsatile in nature consistent with right heart failure. There
is a very large volume of ascites as well as a moderate right
pleural effusion. The ascites appears to be increased in volume
compared to the scan of [**2-8**].
.
The gallbladder and bile ducts are normal as is the liver
parenchyma with no focal abnormalities seen. The right kidney
measures 9.6 cm in length and the left kidney 11 cm. There are
two simple cysts in the mid portion of the left kidney and
otherwise, the kidneys are normal in appearance. The spleen is
mildly enlarged as previously noted. The pancreas shows no
abnormality, but portions of the tail are obscured by bowel gas.
The aorta and retroperitoneal structures cannot be visualized
due to overlying bowel gas.
.
CONCLUSION: Findings are consistent with congestive heart
failure and hepatic congestive hepatopathy. There is a
moderately large right pleural effusion and large volume ascites
which have increased since the prior scan of [**2157-2-8**].

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
2 vessel coronary artery disease. The LM was short and patent.
The LAD
was heavily calcified; ulcerated 50% mid LAd; mid-distal LAD
tortous
with 60% before an aneurysm and 80% after at the origin of a
small D4
with diffusely diseaseed distal LAD beyond; modest upper pole of
high
diagonal with origin tubular 60%; larger lower pole of high 1st
diagonal
with proximal ulcerated 60%; larger S1. The LCx was modest
caliber
vessel; modest high vertically oriented OM1 with proximally
40-50%
stenosis. Modest long vertically oriented OM2 with origin 40%
and mild
luminal irregularities. AV groove Cx 40% just after the origin
of the
OM2. Atrial branch arises from the proximal AV groove Cx before
OM1 with
modest origin stenosis of the atrial branch. The RCA was heavily
calcified; mild luminal irregularities; large branching RPDA
(arising
from a lower AM) and RPL.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed Fick average PA
