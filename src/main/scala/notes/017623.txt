HPI:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 71y M with a history of CAD s/p CABGx2,
HTN, DM, b/l SDH in [**2100**] and paranoid schizophrenia. He presents
today s/p fall at his group home with right sided weakness and
new dysarthria.

At 1300 today, pt was observed by facility supervisor ([**Doctor Last Name 8214**]) to
be dragging his right leg when returning to his room. She asked
him if his leg was in pain and he said it was. He was last seen
normal at 1215 when they went out to lunch at a restaurant. The
supervisor had worked with him earlier that morning and had not
noticed any abnormalities. Since [**2101**], he has used a walker for
an unsteady gait.

Between 1500 and 1530, the patient had an unobserved fall in his
room. He knocked on the wall to get the attention of his nurse.
She found him on the floor without any obvious trauma. He could
not stand up on his own, so she called EMS. When they arrived
and
started asking him questions, she noticed that he was slurring
his words. At the time, he confirmed weakness in his right arm
and leg. He has a bilateral tremor and tardive dyskinesia at
baseline, but the tremor appeared worse to her at the time.

The patient was brought to the hospital, where his initial
vitals
were  BP 137/87 HR 82 RR 18 O2 90%. A code stroke was called at
1600; the ED calculated NIHSS as 4. On exam, he showed
right-sided mild weakness (?face, +drift, +leg drift) and
right-sided ataxia. His labs were notable for a Glucose of 372
and a Cr of 2.0 (baseline CKD with b/l Cr ~2.1). He was taken
for
a non-contrast head CT, which did not show an acute intracranial
hemorrhage or acute infarct (see below). We added CT-P and CT-A
(see below), which were unrevealing. By 1700, his exam showed
increased strength (no more drift) and less ataxia in right arm
and leg. His tremors (primarily Left pill-rolling and jaw/[**Year (4 digits) **]
TD-type movements) persisted. Due to the improvemed exam and
more
imprortantly the history of prior bilateral subdural hematoma,
t-PA was not given.

The patient has not had surgery in the last three weeks. As far
as his group home worker knows, he does not have a history of
stroke (the Right-parietal hypodensity on CT was apparently a
silent or undocumented infarct). He had a b/l subdural hematoma
after a fall in [**2100**] that may have been traumatic though
unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] did take his Aspirin and Plavix this morning.

Physical Exam:
ADMISSION EXAM:
Vitals: T (initially afebrile-->)102.8
BP 137/87 HR 82 RR 18 O2 90%

General: Well-appearing, awake, alert. Quiet, but polite and
responsive to pointed questions. TD-type jaw movements.
Pill-rolling tremor of left index fgr/thumb.
Neck: supple, no meningismus. No goiter. No LAD. No bruits
appreciated in loud ED.
CV: RRR w/o loud M/R/G appreciated in loud ED.
Lungs: CTA anteriorly. Non-labored.
Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND.
Extr: Warm and well-perfused. No edema. Smooth/hairless shins.
Dry feet. (PAD-type appearance). Good distal pulses.

Neurologic exam:

MS: Awake and alert. Oriented to "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **]" [**2107**],
[**Month (only) 956**]. Tracks in all directions. Follows most simple
commands,
but exam is highly limited by motor perseveration on recent
tasks. Inattentive to DOWbw (gives fw). Naming intact to all
NIHSS items except cactus. Repetion intact to "today is a sunny
day in [**Location (un) 86**]." Fluent, but no spontaneous speech and short
responses.

CN:
II: PERRL. Visual fields grossly full on limited exam (makes
saccades to fingers moving on either side of direction of
primary
gaze, up and down on each side).
III, IV, VI: EOMs grossly full and conjugate, no nystagmus
(limited exam [**1-19**] perseveration/inattention).  difficult to
assess because patient moves gaze.
V: symmetrically intact to pinprick V1-V2-V3.
VII: difficult to assess due to TD jaw/lip-smacking movements.
[**Month (only) 116**] be weaker on the Left than right, unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] tremor.
Speech was mildly dysarthric initially, but improved on
re-examination after CT.
IX/X/XII: palate elevates symmetrically and [**Name2 (NI) **] protrudes
midline.

Motor: Exam limited by inattention, motor perseveration, ?lack
of
effort, and tremor.
- Right pronates and drifts down initially; on repeat testing,
it
pronates, but he keeps it up (left does not pronate/fall). Both
delts are breakable ([**3-22**] ?effort) whereas triceps are full ([**4-21**])
bilaterally.
- Initially unable to hold Right leg up against gravity for more
than a second or two (left leg holds indefinitely), but improved
on re-examination to same as left. Initially decreased tone in
Right leg only, but improved on re-examination. Both IPs are
breakable ([**3-22**] ?effort).

Cerebellar: Grossly dysmetric FNF and HKS in the Right arm and
leg. Left side has tremor, which abated with FNF, no dysmetria.
LLE HKS smoother, but exam limited by cooperation/attention.

Reflexes: symmetrically brisk, non-pathologic. Right toes
mute-to-?up / left toes equivocal-to-?down.

Sensory: Pt reports symmetric prinprick and light touch in all
extremities. Otherwise limited exam.

DISCHARGE EXAM:
Able to hold all extremities anti-gravity and against
resistance, though has some difficulty understanding all
commands.  Mild dysmetria bilaterally, right slightly greater
than left.
