Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Change in Mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
HPI:  Patient is an 85 year-old male with history of Atrial
Fibrillation (on Coumadin), multiple falls, who was initially
admitted to the Neurosurgery service in late [**Month (only) **] s/p fall
and change in MS with a right-sided SDH, where he received a
burr hole and subdural drain placement. He was discharged to
rehab and returned to [**Hospital1 18**] one week later from rehab with AMS,
slurred speech and left-sided upper and lower extremity
weakness; head CT on [**2199-11-18**] showed acute on chronic right
parietal SDH. Patient began seizing in the ER, was intubated,
sedated; he was also noted to have fever to 102F and received
Vancomycin, Levaquin, Flagyl, and Ceftriaxone. Patient remained
only on levofloxacin until [**11-23**] for ?UTI (though with neg Ucx)
and then was started on vancomycin on [**11-23**] for MRSA found in
sputum cx. All other cultures (including blood, CSF, Urine) have
been neg to date. Patient was extubated the following day.
Patient has a history of afib but was initially sinus rhythm on
presentation who converted to afib with RVR to 140's. EP was
consulted, diltiazem was started and Lopressor was added for
rate control; plan was for possible ablation if rate was not
well controlled. On the morning of [**11-25**], patient was noted to
have increased respiratory demand with occ 30 seconds of apnea
and tachypnea as well as fever of 101.6. CXR showed interval
worsening of moderate CHF and development of a left and possibly
right pleural effusion, no EKG changes. Patient was given lasix
20mg iv x1, restarted on ceftriaxone. ABG showed 7.48/35/66% on
3L NC. Pt denied having diarrhea. Has baseline non- productive
cough in the past month per family.
.
Of note, prior admission was s/p fall and change in MS, went to
[**Hospital **] Hosp, INR 5.1, seen to have subdural hematoma on CT,
given Dexamethasone, Dilantin, Mannitol. He was intubated, sent
to [**Hospital1 18**], where repeat CT showed Acute on Chronic SDH,
effacement and some midline shift-went to OR for Burr hole and
Subdural drain placement.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD
- admission in [**Month (only) **] for STEMI -- Catherization at that time
showed 100% proximal LAD stent restenosis, diffuse RCA disease,
and a patent LCx stent. A PTCA [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was successfully placed
in LAD. The catherization was complicated by the development of
wide complex tachycardia and hypotension (SBP 80s). As a result,
the patient was defibrillated once, given IV lopressor, IV
Amiodarone, Dopamine pressor, an Intraaortic Balloon Pump, and
intubated to protect airway. He was treated in the CCU,
stabilized, and discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab
-s/p PCI to L circ and LAD in [**2-12**]
-s/p MI [**04**] years ago
-[**9-12**]: pMIBI showed a small fixed inferior defect with slight
apical redistribution suggestive of ischemia.
2. CHF (EF 30-35%)
3. AFib
4. Pacemaker(Cardioverter/Defibrillator) for sick sinus syndrome
5. s/p bilateral total knee replacement
6. s/p umbilical hernia repair

Social History:
Denies tobacco, ETOH, Italian speaking.  Patient apparently is
essentially self-sufficient and is able to garden on a daily
basis.  Has been at rehab facilty since last admission for
subdural hematoma evacuation.  Prior to fall, patient was
essentially self-sufficient and was able to garden on a daily
basis.

Family History:
No history of CAD
