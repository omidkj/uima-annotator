Admission Date:  [**2189-1-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2189-1-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**2113-11-5**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Company 191**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
female who is well-known to the [**Hospital **] Community Health
Center, is mentally retarded, has diabetes mellitus type 2,
hypertension, a history of ETOH abuse who presented to her
PCP on the day of admission complaining of 2 weeks of cough
and lethargy.  She was found to have a BP of 60/palp and
difficulty ambulating.

She was brought by ambulance to the [**Hospital1 18**]-ED where her BP was
noted to be 73/56, and she was noted to be in possible atrial
flutter on EKG.  She was treated with adenosine which
produced a 3:1 conduction, and then with diltiazem at 10 mg
IV which put her in normal sinus rhythm.  She also received a
total of 6 liters of normal saline IV fluid with a BP up to
111/60, and ceftriaxone 1 gm IV, and the sepsis protocol was
initiated.  Her temperature in the ED was 99.8.  A left
subclavian triple-lumen catheter was placed for access, and
she was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  She denied chest pain, dizziness.  She
complained of a mild cough but no sputum.  She denied
dysuria, urinary frequency, diarrhea and abdominal pain.  A
question was raised whether the patient's history was
reliable, as she denied ETOH, because she is known to ingest
alcohol.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 17.9, hematocrit
42.7, platelets 255, sodium 133, potassium 3.7, chloride 94,
bicarb 24, BUN 49, creatinine 2.1, glucose 138, calcium 10.2,
mag 2.2, phos 4.3, albumin 2.9, ALT 192, AST 291, alk phos
197, T-bili 1.7, lactate 5.2.  Blood cultures and urine
cultures have been no growth to date.  UA was negative.  An
EKG showed AFIB versus AFLUTTER versus MAT at 150 beats per
minute which converted to normal sinus at 75 after diltiazem,
with a normal axis, no Q waves, and no acute ST-T wave
changes.  A chest x-ray initially showed mild CHF with left
lung base patchy atelectasis, no pneumothorax, no effusions,
no consolidations.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed
coarse liver echo texture, no masses, no intrahepatic ductal
dilatation, no free fluid in the abdomen.  The portal vein
was patent.  The common bile duct was 7.5 mm.  There was
gallbladder wall thickening but this was not consistent with
acute cholecystitis.  It was consistent with cirrhosis.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] under the sepsis protocol.  She did
quite well with fluids, and ceftriaxone IV.  The next day she
was called out to the floor and transferred that night to the
[**Company 191**] Medicine service.

1) SEPSIS/HYPOTENSION/ID:  The patient presented severely
dehydrated with a creatinine 4x her baseline.  She also had
an elevated white count, elevated lactate, and was
hypotensive.  She responded quite well to aggressive fluid
repletion, and also to ceftriaxone empiric treatment.  She
was essentially afebrile throughout, never really showing any
signs of infection.  Ceftriaxone was continued for 3 days.  A
follow-up chest x-ray was read as left lower lobe
consolidation, could be consistent with pneumonia, though the
patient did not have other signs or symptoms of pneumonia.
At this point, she was transitioned to Levofloxacin 500 po
qd.  She should complete a 5-day course of the Levofloxacin.
The patient presented with what sounded like a viral
syndrome, initially a chest x-ray without signs of pneumonia.
It is possible that burgeoning pneumonia brought her in and
it developed over several days radiographically.  It is also
possible that this left lower lobe consolidation is
atelectasis and that she never had a bacterial pneumonia.
She is also to follow-up with her PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**], [**1-12**].

2) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's baseline creatinine
noted to be 1.0.  She presented at 2.1.  This was felt to be
purely prerenal.  As she responded well to fluids, her
creatinine is actually 0.5 today.  Her urine output was
adequate.  This was felt simply due to hypotension and volume
depletion.

3) TACHYCARDIA:  On presentation, the patient was in a SVT
felt to be atrial flutter versus atrial fib versus multifocal
atrial tachycardia.  After fluids and diltiazem, she
converted to normal sinus rhythm and essentially remained in
normal sinus rhythm.  This was felt probably the result
rather than the cause of her hypotension.  A TSH was checked
which was normal.  We do not believe the patient requires
further evaluation at this time.

4) ELEVATED LFTS:  The patient has a history of ETOH abuse,
hepatitis B and known cirrhosis.  When she presented, her
LFTs were elevated and they consistently trended down over
the course of her stay.  Her LFT elevations were likely
multifactorial due to hypotension, her Hep B, and possible
alcohol ingestion.  The right upper quadrant ultrasound
showed no signs of cholecystitis, and there were no clinical
signs of cholangitis.  Also of note, the patient's INR
appears at baseline to be slightly elevated likely due to
decreased hepatic function combined with perhaps poor
nutritional intake.

5) ETOH ABUSE:  The patient denied alcohol intake; however,
she is known to consume alcohol.  She was placed on a CIWA
scale for diazepam.  However, few doses were needed.  She did
not appear to be in withdrawal.

6) DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2:  The patient is diet controlled
at home.  She was placed on qid fingersticks and regular
insulin sliding scale, but had good control on her own.

7) HYPERTENSION:  The patient is on hydrochlorothiazide and
lisinopril at home.  These medications were held in the
setting of hypotension.  We will hold them on discharge, and
they can be restarted as needed by her PCP next week.

8) HEME:  The patient was admitted with a hematocrit of 43
which decreased to 33 with aggressive hydration, and then
came up to 35.  This was likely due to fluid shifts rather
than to any acute blood loss.  Her hematocrit settled out
around 33-36.  There were no signs of bleeding at any time.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was evaluated by physical therapy.
Upon conversations with the patient's primary nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **], it was felt that she was pretty close to her
baseline.  At this time, the final decision had not been made
whether the patient would be discharged to an extended care
facility or home with services.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To either extended care facility or
homeless services.
