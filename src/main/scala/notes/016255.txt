Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, fevers, chills, and mid diarrhea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2114-4-17**]: ERCP with sphincterotomy, stone and biliary sludge
removal and pancreatic stent placement.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female who was admitted yesterday to
[**Hospital 8**] Hospital for abdominal pain, fevers, chills, and mid
diarrhea. She had a [**Hospital 5283**] which was concerning for cholecystitis
and she was treated with ertapenem. She had a rising T. bili
today to 5, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 3494**] hopsital for
ERCP. During the ERCP, she was found to have a ampullary polyp.
She also developed A. fib with RVR to 140s, thoug her blood
pressure remained stable. She was sent to the [**Hospital1 3494**] ED
where she received diltiazem 10 mg IV boluses x 2 and then was
started on a diltiazem drip.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were HR of 80 on diltiazem drip
at 10 mg/hour, BP 96/46, RR 18, 99% on 2l NC. She was given
unasyn for treatment of cholecystitis. She was given morphine
for abdominal pain that she states is similar to prior episodes
of pancreatitis. She was given diltiazem 30 mg PO and diltiazem
drip was stopped as patient was in NSR. Additionally, she
expressed frustration with being transferred to multiple
hopsitals over the day and requested to leave AMA, however, she
was convinced to stay.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient reports mild epigastric pain
which is improved with morphine. She denies fevers, chills,
diarrhea, chest pain, chest pressure, weight loss, weight gain,
shortness of breath, cough.

[**2114-4-17**]:  ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with HTN, diastolic CHF,
asthma, admitted to OSH with GNR bacteremia with cholesytitis,
cholangitis, and gallstone pancreatitis, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
following unsuccessful ERCP complicated by A. fib with RVR.

1. GNR bacteremia. Likely source of GNR bacteremia is
cholecysitis/cholangitis. Patient's BP remained stable though
patient was initially tachcyardic in setting of A. fib with RVR,
now resolved with diltiazem. Cultures done at OSH revealed
E.coli sensitive to Cipro & Unsasyn. She was continued on Unasyn
and Cipro for double GN coverage. Surgery co-managed this
patient, who underwent successful ERCP on [**2114-4-17**] during which a
gallstone was removed, resolving biliary obstruction. On [**2114-4-19**]
patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Post surgery
patient's WBC was within normal range, patient was afebrile. She
was discharged home without any antibiotic coverage.
.
2. Cholecystitis/Cholangitis. Patient admitted to OSH with
elevated LFTs, abdominal pain, and [**Name (NI) 5283**] sono consistent with
cholecystitis. Given that LFTs were consistent with an
obstructive picture, an ERCP was performed on [**2114-4-17**]. Source of
GNR bacteremia was thought to be from a biliary source. The
patient was continued on antibiotics as above, and was
transferred to surgery once stable for further management. On
[**2114-4-19**] patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgery
was done without complications. Post surgery patient was
continue on antibiotics. WBC was normal.
.
3. Pancreatitis. Likely sedcondary to gallstone pancreatitis.
She was initially hydrated with IVFs, kept NPO, and her pain
managed with morphine. Her lipase was downtrending. On [**2114-4-19**]
patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Surgery was done
without complications. Post surgery patient's diet was advanced
slowly to regular/diabetic, patient tolerated diet well.
Patient's liver enzymes were normal prior disharge, her lipase
was slightly elevated.
.
4. A. fib with RVR. Paroxysmal and recurrent. Pt reports [**3-14**] yrs
of palpitations. Developed A.fib with RVR in setting of
procedure, which resolved initially after diltiazem drip and
continuation on diltiazem 30 PO [**Month/Day (3) **] but returned x5hrs on floor,
with spontaneous return to SR. Given patient's CHADS score of 3,
she may be a candidate for anticoagulation and should be
scheduled with PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] to discuss this further. With
Diltiazem 30mg PO [**Name9 (PRE) **] patient heart rate continue to be sinus
rhythm with occasional PACs. Patient was started on Aspirin 325
mg PO QDay and her Diltiazem was converted to Diltiazem ER 240mg
PO qday per cardiology recommendation. Patient will have a
follow up with cardiologist on [**2114-6-4**] regarding further A-fib
management.
.
5. HTN.  Anti-hypertensives were held in the setting of
cholangitis/cholecystitis. Patient's BP was closly monitored
during hospital stay and her SBP was 120s-150s. Patient was
instructed to restart all her home anti-hypertensive medication
after discharge and follow up with her PCP for further
management.
.
6. Asthma.  Continued home advair, and given prn nebs.
.
7. Diabetes.  Kept on HISS and monitored fingers
