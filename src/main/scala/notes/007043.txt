weekly for laboratory draws. He is a former smoker with a 50-
pack-year history. Occasional alcohol. No drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 97.3,
blood pressure of 139/54, heart rate of 75, respiratory rate
of 14, and O2 saturation of 97% on room air. In general, the
patient was lying in bed in no apparent distress. Alert and
oriented. HEENT revealed PERRLA, EOMI, moist mucous
membranes. Chest revealed bilateral crackles halfway up the
base. No wheezes. A 13-cm JVP. Heart exam revealed a regular
rate and rhythm. S1 and S2. A soft [**1-31**] to 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur. The abdomen was soft, obese, nontender, with
normal active bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
The extremities revealed 3+ edema bilaterally in the lower
extremities up to the knees. No erythema or warmth.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Notable for a white count of
5.0, a hematocrit of 33.0, an INR of 1.1, a BUN of 48, a
creatinine of 2.4, a CK of 22.

STUDIES:  An echocardiogram from [**2168-7-26**] with an EF of
20%.

A catheterization from [**2167-7-27**] shows 1-VD, status post
RCA stent, severe pulmonary artery hypertension.

A chest x-ray from [**2169-8-17**] shows vascular
redistribution in the upper zones consistent with edema; and
no effusion.

EKG reveals AFib, V paced at 75 beats per minute, no
concordance or ST elevations over 5 mm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is an 82-year-old man with a
past medical history of CAD, CHF, AFib, and chronic renal
insufficiency who presents with worsening heart failure.

1. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient ruled out for a
   myocardial infarction and did not have any significant EKG
   changes, although he was V paced. The patient was seen by
   the CHF consult. The patient was believed to be a [**State 531**]
   Heart Failure class 4 given his shortness of breath at
   rest. The patient's dose of Lasix was titrated up, but the
   patient only responded minimally. In addition, his
   hydralazine dose was titrated up with the Imdur. The
   patient was thought to be a candidate for the revived
   trial involving levosimendan for decompensated chronic
   heart failure. The patient was transferred to the CTU for
   induction of this trial. The patient tolerated the trial
   well with a stable QTC and subjective improvement of his
   symptoms. He diuresed 1.5 to 2 liters a day. Also, his
   Lasix was increased up to 40 mg IV b.i.d. A repeat
   echocardiogram was performed which showed an EF of 30% and
   an increased TR gradient up to 60; representing worsened
   pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient continued to
   diurese well, although his creatinine started to climb up.
   Creatinine stabilized at 2.8. The patient's Lasix was
   converted to a p.o. regimen. Also, he was started on
   Aldactone for class 4 heart failure. Over the next several
   days, his creatinine increased to 3.2. Lasix was held and
   nesiritide was begun. The patient diuresed well and
   creatinine stabilized at 3.1. The patient was restarted on
   Lasix.

1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The patient ruled out for a MI
   and had no significant EKG changes.

1. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient was continued on
   amiodarone. He was not felt to be a candidate Coumadin
   given his past history of GI bleeds.

1. CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: The patient stabilized his
   creatinine at 3.1.

1. URINARY TRACT INFECTION: The patient was found to have a
   Klebsiella UTI. He completed a 7-day course of
   levofloxacin.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home with the following
diagnoses.
