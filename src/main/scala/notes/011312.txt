Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
SAH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2191-7-11**]: Cerebral Angiogram w/coiling of the R PCOMM aneurysm
[**2191-7-21**]: PEG placement
[**2191-7-23**]: R EVD placement


History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a 73-year-old right-handed-woman with known
aneurysms s/p coiling of nine months ago at [**Hospital1 2025**] here after being
found down per her son.  [**Name (NI) **] history obtained per son, [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) **] who is also her HCP.

He reports that she had undergoing head imaging for ?stroke
symptoms and found to have two intracranial aneurysms and had
one
coiled 9 months ago at [**Hospital1 2025**] but the other one was too small to
intervene.  She had TIA symptoms afterwards but no lasting
deficit.  Her outpatient neurologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**].

She was doing well and actually played cards with the son last
night.  This afternoon, he went to check on her and found her on
the floor faced down with vomit on the floor.  When he turned
her
over, she was responsive and verbal but was not ambulating well
hence EMT was called.  In the ED, head CT showed bilateral,
extensive SAH and coiling artifact of L MCA distribution.

Pertinent Results:
[**2191-7-10**] CTA HEAD:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the
sulci,
interhemispheric fissure and sylvian fissures. Component of
intraventricular hemorrhage involving the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral ventricle and the third ventricle.

2. Areas of outpouching at the origin of the right posterior
communicating
artery and left posterior communicating artery, possibly
representing
aneurysms. Would recommend catheter angiography to further
evaluate for the presence of intracranial aneurysms.

3. Streak artifact from the coil pack in the left MCA on its
evaluation at
this level. Unable to determine if there is filling of the prior
aneurysm in this location due to artifacts.

[**2191-7-10**] CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection or acute
aortic
injury.
2. Status post right upper lobectomy and left lower lobe wedge
resection.
Focal opacities along the left lower lobe suture line and
periphery of the
right lower lobe are likely areas of scarring. Peripheral
opacity in the right lower lobe with a linear geographic border
is likely due to post-radiation changes. Correlation of these
findings with prior imaging, however, is recommended.
3. Diffusely enlarged thyroid gland for which clinical
correlation is
recommended.

[**2191-7-10**] CT [**Month/Day/Year 12784**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of prevertebral soft tissue swelling or acute
fracture.

2. Extra-axial, extra-dural circumferential hyperdensity within
the spinal
canal at the level of C3-C4 vertebral bodies may be due epidural
or subdural hematoma at this level. MRI is recommended for
further evaluation if not contraindicated.

3. Diffusely enlarged thyroid gland.

4. Right carotid artery stent with probable post treatment and
post radiation changes as noted above.

[**2191-7-11**] MRI [**Month/Day/Year 12784**]:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage in the cervical
spine. There is multilevel degenerative joint disease. At the
level of C3 and C4, there is protrusion of the disc, with
flattening of the cord and narrowing of the canal. There is
elevation of the posterior longitudinal ligament with
widening of the epidural space at this level. At the level of C4
and C5,
there is a disc protrusion with flattening of the cord, but no
canal narrowing at this level. At the level of C5 and C6, there
is bilateral neural foraminal narrowing due to uncovertebral
osteophytes. There is also narrowing of the canal by
intervertebral osteophytes at this level. There is
retrolisthesis of C5 on C6, as seen on prior study and likely
due to degenerative changes.

There is a nodular cyst in the left lobe of the thyroid gland.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intraspinal hemorrhage.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes as outlined above with disc
protrusion and narrowing of the canal at the level of C3-C4 and
C5-C6 as well as bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at the
level of C5-C6.
3. Nodular cyst in the left lobe of the thyroid. Would consider
ultrasound
if not already completed.

[**2191-7-12**] Head CT:
1. Extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the
sulci and
sylvian fissures unchanged from prior study. Intraventricular
hemorrhage in the third ventricle as well as the occipital horns
of the lateral ventricles, likely from redistribution from
subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Hydrocephalus, with the left lateral ventricle being
asymmetrically
enlarged when compared to the right but unchanged from prior
study.
3. Streak artifact from the coil pack in the left MCA aneurysm
as well as
from the new coil in the right posterior communicating artery
aneurysm.
Unable to determine if there is filling of the prior aneurysms
in these
locations due to artifact.

[**2191-7-13**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION: Study is severely limited by motion artifact, with:
1. Enlargement of the ventricles bilaterally consistent with
progressive
hydrocephalus.
2. Stable bilateral subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage
when compared to prior study.
3. Coil packs in the left MCA and right posterior communicating
artery with streak artifact at those locations.

[**2191-7-13**] Head CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. Evolution of the subarachnoid hemorrhage along bilateral
cortical sulci
and sylvian fissures. There is decrease in the amount of
intraventricular
hemorrhage.
2. Asymmetric dilatation of bilateral lateral ventricles, left
being dilated more than right.
3. Streak artifact from coil pack in left MCA and right
posterior
communicating artery. It is difficult to determine if there is
filling of the prior aneurysm in these locations due to the
streak artifact from the coil pack.
4. No evidence of new aneurysm/ vasospasm.

[**2191-7-15**] RUE US:
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.

[**2191-7-17**] Head CTA:
HEAD CTA: The intracranial internal carotid and vertebral
arteries, and their major branches, are patent. Allowing for
