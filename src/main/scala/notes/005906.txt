Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension following a-flutter ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
A flutter ablation. EP testing.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59921**] is a 67M with PMH of CAD s/p CABG in [**2155**],
numerous MI's most recent in [**2167**], and complete heart block with
pacer/ICD implantation in [**2174-11-7**], who presented to the
hospital today for elective ablation of atrial flutter. The
patient first began to notice symptoms such as fatigue,
shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and dyspnea on exertion in
[**2177-2-6**]. In [**2177-5-6**] the patient was seen in the device
clinic for routine follow-up, and was noted to have atrial
flutter with complete heart block. In early [**Month (only) 216**], he underwent
TEE and DC cardioversion at [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital, and
since that time his symptoms have markedly improved. However, in
susequent outpatient cardiology visits, it was decided that he
should undergo atrial flutter ablation to prevent recurrent
arryhthmia. Since the patient has not undergone defibrillation
threshold testing since device implantation in [**2174**], he was
scheduled for a combined ICD testing and TEE/atrial flutter
ablation procedure in the EP lab for today, [**2177-10-24**]. His
coumadin has been discontinued since Saturday and he has been
bridged with Lovenox.
.
Prior to presenting for his study, the patient states that he
was in his USOH, with his only complaint being chronic hip pain.
The patient felt generally well and denied any chest pain or
dyspnea. He also denies palpitations, lightheadedness or
syncope. He reports that he has never been shocked by his
device. He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
cough, or hemoptysis. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
In the EP lab, TEE showed no throbmus, and AFL isthmus ablation
was performed. Subsequently he underwent an EP study (DFT
testing) x 2. After the second test he had prolonged hypotension
to SBP in 50's for 10-15 minutes. Also had hypoxia with poor
airway security, desta to 80s. Briefly given neo and dopa with
resolution of hypotension, and an LMA was placed for airway
protection, which was d/c'ed on recovery. His L femoral arterial
line was left in place, and he was admitted to the CCU for
further monitoring.


Past Medical History:

disease, with multiple male relatives having [**Name (NI) 5290**] in their
50-60s. Mother died of MI in her 70's.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING

Pertinent Results:
creatinine 2.3, baseline 2.2
INR 1.6
.
ECHO [**10-24**]
The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. LV
systolic function appears depressed. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

IMPRESSION: No atrial thrombus seen. Borderline low left atrial
appendage velocities and mild spontaneous echo contrast in the
left atrium/LAA.

Brief Hospital Course:
67M with CAD, CHB s/p pacer/ICD [**2174**], and recent development of
atrial flutter, admitted for defibrillation threshold testing
and a-flutter ablation c/b brief hypotension and airway
compromise, admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring post
procedure.
.
1. Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive after procedure, and
was briefly on dopamine and neosynephrine. Was weaned off prior
to being transferred to CCU for overnight monitoring.
Hypotension likey related to propofol administered during
anesthesia for DFT testing, or a transient effect of induced
arrhythmia. Patient with stable blood pressure in the CCU. His
SBP fell temporarily to high 60's after morning administration
of antihypertensives. He is been told to stagger daily BP meds
by taking Cozaar at night. Other than that change, he is to
continue his home regimen.
.
2. CAD/angina: continued medical management with Isosorbide MN
120mg daily, Lipitor 40mg daily, valsartan 50mg daily,
carvedilol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. Also started on ASA 81 mg daily. Will
continue this at home.
.
3. CHF - no documented EF, but likely chronic systolic CHF.
Continued BB and [**Last Name (un) **] as above, and bumetanide 4 mg am, and 2mg
pm)
.
4. Rhythm - s/p flutter ablation, currently in ventricularly
paced rhythm. Underlying rhythm is CHB. Patient is to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks, and the device clinic as per
scheduled appt. He will continue amiodarone 200 mg daily. He is
to restart coumadin tonight, and get INR checked on monday. The
result will be sent to his PCP's office. He was also given
Lovenox day of discharge, and was given a prescription for 1
dose day after discharge.
.
5. Hyperlipidemia: continued statin
.
6. DM: continue glypizide held in the hospital, FSG qid, RISS.
will restart glypizide upon discharge.
