Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
infected PEG tube

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-7-30**] - laparotomy and open debridement of L abdominal abscess
and necrotizing fasciitis with new gastrostomy tube placement

History of Present Illness:
89 yo female with pmhx sig for a-fib, aortic stenosis, recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) **] for SDH, s/p evacuation.  Her hospital
course was complicated by seizures, hypoxic respiratory failure,
and VAP requiring intubation and subsequent trach and PEG
placement on [**2132-7-11**].  She was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on
[**2132-7-19**] but remained vent-dependent with recurrent high fevers.
She was temporarily changed from Vancomycin to Linezolid when
her PICC was removed, but then restarted on Vancomycin recently
although culture data remained negative.  Per records from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab, her TFs had been held secondary to an ileus which
resolved with an aggressive bowel regimen.  When the TFs were
restarted yesterday, feeds were noted to immediately return out
of the abdomen around the g-tube.  When the g-tube was placed to
gravity, 200 cc of thick green pus came out of the tube this
morning, and pus was easily expressed around the site.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
Currently she is responsive to voice, able to follow commands
and answer questions; denies pain but heavily grimaces with
palpation of her abdomen.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo female with recent SDH s/p evacuation with complicated
course including intubation, VAP; and eventual trach and PEG
placement.  Pt readmitted from rehab for recurrent fevers, found
to have infected PEG tube with necrotizing fasciitis, now with
afib and RVR. Hospital course by problem:
.
# A-fib - H/o of A fib during prior admission, on [**8-3**] in afib
with RVR up to 130's-140s. Increased sympathetic drive in
setting of hypotension may have contributed to elevated HR.
ROMI'd. HR reduced to 90s with 3x 5mg IV dilt on [**8-3**]. Patient
was started on a heparin drip. She continued to be in afib with
better rate control until [**8-5**] - increasing HR into 130s
unresponsive to IV amiodarone and diltiazem with decreasing
MAPs. Pt tried on esmolol drip for rate control on [**8-6**] which
failed secondary to poor rate control and decrease in SBPs to
80s. There was poor rate control on diltiazem drip (110s-150s)
and we were unable to increase diltiazim drip rate per
decreasing SBPs. Improved rate control with po diltiazem
(90s-100s) briefly despite levophed; however she continued to
demonstrate rapid ventricular rate on [**8-9**]. Dilt drip was
restarted on [**8-9**] and was attempted to be weaned several times,
but was unable to be weaned given pt's tenuous HR control.
Phenylephrine drip was used to maintain blood pressure and
increased to maintain MAPs 50-60s. Rate fluctuated from 60s to
110s. The patient's daughter did not want elective cardioversion
and given the patient's overall poor prognosis she was made
comfort measures only and the drips were turned off.
.
#) hypotension - pt had decreased UOP since admission. She was
given multiple crystalloid boluses per day and many colloid
boluses, including 2u PRBC on [**7-29**], 25mg albumin on [**7-31**], and
1uPRBC and 25g albumin on [**8-1**] with UOP consistently ~20cc/hr.
There was evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR and much peripheral
edema on exam without evidence of oxygen desaturation. She was
losing a significant amount of fluid from her wound and so I/O
recordings were not accurate assessment of her fluid status. She
was believed to be intravascularly very volume depleted. Pt was
aggressivley hydrated with good response to  UOP and CVP at
target (19-20); however, aggressive hydration was held per
increased pulmonary edema on CXR with increasing FiO2
requirement. Pt intermittently became hypotensive and pressor
dependent due to volume depletion and/ or RVR. As above, it was
eventually decided by her daughter that she would be weaned off
of pressors and fluid would be stopped as she was made CMO.
.
# Respiratory [**Name (NI) 37370**] pt initially with hypoxemic respiratory
failure thought to be secondary to pulmonary edema from severe
aortic stenosis, but also with VAP.  She was unable to be weaned
from the vent. [**2132-8-6**] CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema with
large bilateral effusions, likely a result of aggressive fluids.
Pt failed PS trial and required AC on increased FiO2. She was
kept on the ventilator until she expired, per her daughter's
request.
.
# [**Name (NI) **] pt with increasing leukocytosis over several days with no
clear source, with 4+ GNRs, klebsiella pna and pseudomonas on
[**8-6**] sputum despite vancomycin and aztreonam treatment, and low
grade fever. Started meropenem and tobramycin on [**8-11**] for double
coverage of pseudomonas, d/c'd aztreonam as sensitivities were
not performed for aztreonam.
.
# Infected PEG tube/ abscess/ necrotizing fasciitis - pt with
recurrent fevers and bandemia while at rehab despite
antibiotics. PEG tube was draining frank pus on day of
admission. PEG tube removed by GI on [**7-28**] with foley in place to
maintain tissue tract. CT abdomen/ pelvis [**7-29**] showed presence
of 9cmx3cm abscess from g-tube to pelvis. PEG tube swab showed
2+GNR with sparse growth of pseudomonas. Gene
