Service:  MED


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Anemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 73-year-old man with the
extensive past medical history significant for diabetes,
chronic kidney disease, hypertension and peripheral vascular
disease presented to the nephrology clinic on [**2197-1-24**] with increasing fatigue and lower extremity edema. Blood
work done at that time revealed a hematocrit of 19 in a
setting of INR of 6. He was triaged in the emergency room for
further work up. On further questioning the patient denies
any melena, hematochezia or bleeding of any kind or bruising.
Nasogastric lavage done in the emergency room was positive
for coffee grounds. He was transfused with 1 units of red
blood cells in the emergency room after which he was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. In the Intensive Care
Unit his coagulopathy was reversed with vitamin K and fresh
frozen plasma and he was further transfused to a stable
hematocrit. Endoscopy done revealed gastritis with lots of
blood in the stomach, granularity and nodular lesion in the
duodenum which possibly could be the source of his bleeding.
He was eventually transferred out to the floor after a stable
hematocrit. On the floor he was initiated by dialysis by the
renal team.

1.  Diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease stage 4
    complicated by hyperkalemia, volume overload, secondary
    hypoparathyroidism and anemia.

3.  Right adrenal adenoma.
4.  Gout.
5.  History of prostate cancer, status post prostatectomy.
6.  Remote history of nephrolithiasis.

8.  Peripheral vascular disease with carotid stenosis,
    infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, deep venous
    thrombosis, iron deficiency anemia and adrenal nodule.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Quit smoking at age 73. Retired as a
chemical mixer from a leather tannery. No alcohol or illicit
drug use. Lives at home with his wife and family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother had liver cancer. Father and mother
had cerebrovascular accidents. Paternal grandfather rectal
cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival to the floor vital signs:
Blood pressure 143/93, heart rate 80, temperature 99.2.
Patient appeared in no acute distress. Head and neck
examination showed PERRL. Moist mucous membranes. No elevated
jugular venous distension. No cervical lymphadenopathy,
supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Heart and lungs normal.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, no palpable masses.
Extremities showed absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
pulses bilaterally. Right lower extremity revealed bluish
discoloration of the toes (patient reports this to be present
for the past 3 months).

On neurological examination the patient was intact
neurologically. Of note in the Intensive Care Unit streaks of
blood were noted on the glove with black colored stools on
rectal examination with erythema and maceration of the skin
around the rectum.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA, X-RAY AND OTHER TESTS:  CBC  on
admission hematocrit 19.1, on discharge 29.3. On admission
white count 16, on discharge 12.3. Platelets at discharge
201. Coagulation panel on admission INR is 6.7, PT 55.1, PTT
46.1. Coagulation panel at discharge was normal. Reticulocyte
count 2.2. BUN and creatinine at admission 95 and 11
respectively, at discharge 42 and 7.9 respectively. After the
last laboratory on the day of discharge the patient was
dialyzed.

Liver function tests normal. Troponin 0.11, 0.12, 0.13.
Calcium 7.8, phosphorus 3.7, magnesium 1.4, total protein
5.8, albumin 2.8. A1C 6.2. Parathyroid levels 411. Hepatitis
panel negative. Lactate normal. Urinalysis revealed 11, 18
RBCs. Blood cultures done negative at discharge. At the time
of discharge Helicobacter pylori serology negative. At the
time of discharge urine culture contaminated specimen.
Specimen obtained during esophagogastroduodenoscopy, biopsy
revealed hyperplasia of gastric pit. Refer to MR for details.
Chest x-ray on admission revealed no acute cardiopulmonary
process. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with first
degree AV block, right bundle branch block. Unchanged from
prior electrocardiograms.

PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and
infusion of dialysis.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Acute blood loss anemia from
upper gastrointestinal bleeding: After the correction of
coagulopathy and transfusion of 5 units of packed red blood
cells the patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy that
revealed the above findings and a biopsy was done that
revealed the above findings. During the rest of the hospital
course his hematocrit remained stable. He was started on
pantoprazole to be taken 2 times a day. The patient is
scheduled for a repeat upper endoscopy as indicated below. It
is suggested that he also get a colonoscopy at that same
time. The colonoscopy was scheduled on the same day as the
endoscopy. Gastrin levels were sent and are pending at the
time of discharge. Will defer to the primary care provider to
follow up on the gastrin levels. Coumadin was stopped as the
patient had completed about 11 months of anticoagulation
therapy for a deep venous thrombosis. He was initiated on
aspirin. He was advised to refrain from using non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory medications as well as alcohol and
caffeine.

Chronic kidney disease, stage 5: Dialysis was initiated at
this time under the guidance of nephrology. He was started on
RenaGel and nephro caps. Epogen will be administered 3x a
week during dialysis. Outpatient follow up was arranged by
social work for patient to get continued dialysis as
indicated below on Tuesdays, Thursday and Saturdays.

Peripheral vascular disease: The patient was started on
aspirin and then warfarin was stopped. Vascular surgery
attending who follows the patient in clinic, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was
attempted to be contact[**Name (NI) **]. However, he was traveling and
could not be contact[**Name (NI) **]. The vascular consulting was contact[**Name (NI) **]
who recommended that given the chronicity of the problem it
is best if the patient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for the
possibility of an angiogram now that he is on dialysis.

Hypertension: He was continued on his medications during the
hospitalization after he was out of the Intensive Care Unit.
Blood pressure remained stable.

Leukocytosis: An infection work up remained negative, likely
reactive.

Gout: Allopurinol was continued.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus: He was continued on glipizide on
his home dose with the insulin sliding scale and the A1C was
less than 7.

Deep venous thrombosis: Warfarin as above was stopped. The
patient was placed on aspirin and encouraged ambulation. The
patient will require deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis while
immobile. For example, if he has further hospitalizations or
perioperatively.

The patient also has abdominal aortic aneurysm and adrenal
nodular as well as carotid stenosis on multiple radiological
studies done in our system. These should be followed up as
per the discretion of the primary care provider.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable. Discharged to home.

PATIENT DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was discharged
with the following instructions: Please follow with your
primary care doctor or return to the hospital if you have
fevers, chills, chest pain, dizziness, or any other symptom
concerning to you. Make an appointment as instructed below
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6431**] in the next 1 week. You should blood work done
at that time for hematocrit. Also discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6431**] about
getting another urine test to look for blood as the urine
test during the hospitalization reveals some blood. You are
scheduled for an upper endoscopy and as a colonoscopy as
well. Please contact your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 16615**] for the preparation of the colonoscopy.

Please attend the dialysis sessions as instructed. You should
not take Coumadin as this may make you bleed for the ulcer.
Avoid taking
