Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7281**]
Chief Complaint:
bright red blood per rectum

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old male with Past medical history of
Diabetes type 2 complicated by nephropathy s/p living related
donor kidney transplant in [**2137**] with subsequent baseline Cr of
2, CAD s/p stents to LAD and Left circumflex, diastolic CHF with
EF=65%, Peripheral Vascular Disease, hypertension, pulmonary
hypertension (45 to 55 mm Hg based on TTE in [**8-/2146**]), OSA on
CPAP, history of C diff, chronic gastritis, and history of lower
GI bleed 5 years ago s/p colonoscopy and successful clipping in
NY presenting from his [**Hospital1 1501**] with multiple episodes of Bright red
blood per rectum consistent with a repeat lower GI bleed.  In
the ED he filled a bed pan with bright red blood.  Otherwise, he
was asymptomatic and never became tachycardic or hypotensive.
His daughter, [**Name (NI) **], who is a GI physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 9012**] initially
preferred to perform a colonoscopy first and would not consent
to CTA with potential embolization as she was concerned about
the IV dye load for his kidneys.  However, she did agree to
pursue this after speaking with the GI team over the phone in
the ED.  He received IVFs with bicarb and normal saline for
pre-hydration in the ED.  He was also given 2 units of pRBCs for
a Hct of 23.6 from a recent baseline of 29.  Access was obtained
with a 16 gauge peripheral in the Left upper extremity and he
already had a PICC line in place in his Right upper extremity
from a previous admission.  Transplant surgery, GI, and IR were
consulted in the ED and the patient had a CTA prior to arrival
to the ICU which was significant for a cecal blush.  Initial VS:
98.9, 68, 129/40, 18, 98% RA.  Vital signs prior to transfer:
HR=70s and BP=110s systolic
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient appeared comfortable and had
no acute complaints.

Imaging:
========
[**3-21**] CTA abdomen:
-----------------
IMPRESSION:
1. Contrast extravasation in the cecum, representing active GI
bleed.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
.
[**3-22**] Mesenteric Angiography:
FINDINGS:
1. Conventional vascular anatomy, with extensive atherosclerotic
plaque
within the SMA, aorta, and iliac arteries. Left iliac stent was
noted and
patent.
2. Initial right colic and SMA angiography demonstrated very
delayed
appearance of a tiny focus of contrast extravasation within the
ileocecal
area, likely corresponding CTA findings.
3. Sequential selective catheterization of initially two
potential
third/fourth order branches within the right colic artery that
might have
supplied this area, followed by additional selection of two
potential sources within the ileocolic artery did not
demonstrate any further extravasation.  After this tiny focus
was seen on initial angiography, no it could not be
re-demonstrated on the remaining portion of our study (over
approximately 2-3 hours). No further extravasation was
identified, suggesting that the source of bleeding had stopped.
As a specific source branch could not be determined, no
embolization was performed.
IMPRESSION:
1. Tiny focus of contrast extravasation initially seen within
the cecum,
which stopped on subsequent angiography.
2. The source branch could not be determined as bleeding had
stopped, and no embolization was performed.
.
[**3-23**] Tagged red cell scan:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of active bleeding during the time of study.
2. Transplanted right pelvic kidney.
.
[**2147-3-24**] Colonoscopy:
Impression:
-Polyps in the whole colon
-Diverticulosis of the transverse colon and sigmoid colon
-Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
-Angioectasia in the cecum (endoclip)
-Macerated, friable in the rectum compatible with injury from
recent flexiseal
-Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
-Recommendations: Serial hcts to ensure stability. Repeat
colonoscopy to remove polpys and assess rectum in the next 3
months. Recommend this be done with an adult colonoscope.
