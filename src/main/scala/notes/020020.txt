MRI cervical spine [**2134-9-3**]

FINDINGS: There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of C6 on C7.
Significant
increased STIR signal in the C5 and C6, and to a lesser extent
C4, vertebral
bodies, consistent with known fractures. Please refer to the
dedicated CT of
the cervical spine for further characterization of these
fractures.

There is moderate narrowing of the central canal by the C6-7
retrolisthesis.
On T2 and STIR images, there is increased signal intensity
within the cord
from the left mid C4 level to upper C7 level. There is
associated
susceptibility artifact, which suggests hemorrhagic contusions.

There are multiple ligamentous injuries. The anterior
longitudinal ligament
is disrupted at C5-C6. The posterior longitudinal ligament
appears disrupted
from C4-C6. There is significant abnormal signal within the
interspinous
ligaments, most pronounced at C3-C4 but also at C4-C5. There is
widening of
the interspinous space between C3 and C4. The ligamentum flavum
also appears
disrupted at C3-C4.

There is increased STIR signal intensity in the paravertebral
soft tissues,
consistent with soft tissue injury.

IMPRESSION:

1. Hemorrhaging contusion of the spinal cord at the C4 through
C7 level.

2. Multiple ligamentous injuries as described above involving
the anterior
longitudinal ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament,
ligamentum flavum, and
interspinous ligaments.

3. Abnormal signal within the C4 through C6 vertebral bodies,
consistent with
history of known fractures.

4. Grade 1 retrolisthesis of C6 on C7 with mild-to-moderate
narrowing of the
vertebral canal.


CTA Neck [**2134-9-3**]
FINDINGS: There is normal opacification of the carotid arteries
bilaterally
without evidence for stenosis, occlusion, or other vascular
injury. The
distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 6.4 mm on the
left and 5.4
mm on the right.

The right vertebral artery is patent from its origin without
evidence for
stenosis, occlusion, or other vascular injury.

The left vertebral artery is occluded just distal to its origin
at
approximately the T1 level. There is apparent reconstitution at
the level of
C6. This could represent retrograde filling or collateral flow.

There is no evidence for contrast extravasation or
pseudoaneurysm formation.

Multiple cervical vertebral fractures as characterized on recent
CT of the
cervical spine from [**2134-9-3**] at 4:41 hours are again
seen. Please
refer to that report for more detailed characterization.

IMPRESSION:

1. Occlusion of the left vertebral at the T1 level with apparent

reconstitution at the C6 level. This could represent collateral
or retrograde
flow.

2. Unremarkable appearance of the bilateral carotid and right
vertebral
arteries.


Portable AP chest radiograph [**2134-9-27**]

There is slight worsening of the left lower lung atelectasis
which now most
likely involves not only the left lower lobe but potentially the
lingula. The
atelectasis is accompanied by small amount of pleural effusion.
The right
infrahilar opacity is grossly unchanged and most likely
represents area of
atelectasis. No pneumothorax is demonstrated. No failure is
present. The
tracheostomy was removed. The multiple orthopedic hardware is
overlying the
patient's chest.








Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the trauma service and transferred to the
Trauma ICU. Neurosurgery was consulted given her spine injuries;
she was placed in a Halo. Vascular surgery was also consulted
for left vertebral artery injury, she underwent CTA of her neck
to determine if acute intervention was warranted and this was
not indicated.

She was taken to the operating room for tracheostomy, PEG and
IVC filter placement; there were no intraoperative
complications. She was eventually weaned off of the ventilator
once her tracheostomy was placed and was later transferred to
the regular nursing unit. She continued to receive tube feedings
via her PEG; Speech and Swallow performed a bedside evaluation
and she was advanced to an oral soft diet. Her tube feedings
were eventually cycled; she is taking in adequate oral solids
and liquids without any difficulty.

She developed a Stage II decubitus on her sacral/coccyx region
and [**Last Name (un) 2501**] there was concern for a deep tissue injury; the Wound
Care Nurse Specialist was consulted and made recommendations
regarding dressing changes; [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] cushion was provided when out
of bed; she has always been on a pressure reduction mattress
throughout her hospital stay. Plastic surgery was consulted for
evaluation of a possible skin graft at some point; she will need
to follow up in [**Hospital 3595**] clinic in [**12-16**] weeks for further
evaluation.

Her tracheostomy was decannulated on HD #25; she initially had
difficulty clearing her secretions and discussions took place
with regards to replacing with a smaller Trach. Patient and her
husband declined this option; she continued to be monitored
closely requiring only intermittent tracheal suctioning. She
continued on nebulizer treatments and was eventually able to
clear her secretions more effectively.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted early on and
worked closely with her throughout her hospital stay. Social
work remained closely involved with patient and her husband as
well.

She was screened early on for a spinal cord rehab; there was
lack of insurance so the choices were limited for the her. She
was ultimately accepted at [**Location (un) 86**] Medial Center and plans were
underway to facilitate the transfer.
