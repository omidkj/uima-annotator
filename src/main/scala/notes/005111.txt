Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8928**]
Chief Complaint:
hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**6-11**] EGD
[**6-12**] Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
66F with hx of COPD, HTN, and DM who presents with with 3 days
of dark stools. She noticed red blood in her toilet today.  Over
the past week she has had intermittent chest pain and shortness
of breath. Chest pain is substernal and radiates to jaw,
associated with SOB, and is exertional.  No abdominal pain.
Nausea, no vomting.  She went to OSH ([**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **]), where Hct was
found to be 13.3 (baseline 34), trop I 0.31 (thought to be due
to demand ischemia). Vitals at OSH were reportedly stable with
HR 95 and BP 105/43.  She was transfused 3 units PRBCs, given 2
L NS, Protonix, and Levaquin (for unclear reasons).  They
consulted cards, surgery, and finally, GI, who wanted the
patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for for further management.

She states that for the past 3 days, she has noticed loose, dark
stools mixed with BRBPR that comes out in a "gush" before her
BM. She thought this was secondary to hemorrhoids, and therefore
didn't immediately present for care. However, given exertional
chest pain in a bandlike distribution across her chest, assoc w/
nausea/SOB in addition to extreme fatigue and lightheadedness,
she went to OSH ED.  Very occassional sharp pains in stomach
over past month when taking ice cubes.  Otherewise none.  Some
fatigue and muscle pain over past 3 days.  Some loss of appetite
past 3 days.

She has never had an endoscopic procedure in the past, including
colonoscopy. She denies any history of melena or BRBPR. She does
have lactose intolerance and IBS, so her bowel habits are
variable, but states that she is currently having frequent
stools. She notes recent "heartburn" symptoms for the past [**12-26**]
days as well, for which she has been taking Tums PRN. Also of
note, she takes ibuprofen 600mg 1-2 times per day x several
months for LBP.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were: 98.6 91 97/54 20 100% on
RA.  NG lavage showed a scant amount of red blood that cleared
quickly, and the patient reportedly had a small amount of BRBPR.
 GI and cardiology were consulted, large-bore IV access x 3
obtained, and blood was sent for crossmatch.  HCT was 23.3.  GI
recommended admitting to MICU, 2 additional units of PRBCs to be
given in ED, EGD/colonoscopy in the morning, and CTA and call
fellow if hemodynamically unstable overnight.  Vitals stable
here.  BP 120s/53.  No fluids or red cells given in the ED.

On arrival to the MICU, patient feels well and has no pain.

CXR
The lung volumes are normal.  Borderline size of the cardiac
silhouette without pulmonary edema.  The patient has received a
nasogastric
tube.  The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the
tube projects
over the middle parts of the stomach.  No complications, notably
no
pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions, no pneumonia.
.

EKG
ST depressions in V3-V6
.
CT C/A/P
1.  Focal cecal wall thickening near the ileocecal valve, likely
corresponding
to primary lesion.  Local lymphadenopathy measures up to 10 x 7
mm.
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis
versus consolidation.
3.  Multiple peripheral ground-glass nodules in the lungs may be
of infectious
origin although metastatic disease is not excluded.  Close
interval followup
is recommended.  Borderline mediastinal lymph nodes may also be
re-evaluated
at this time.
4.  Thyroid nodule in the left lobe should be correlated with
prior imaging or
further evaluated with routine thyroid ultrasound.
5.  8-mm focus of enhancement within segment 7 of the liver may
represent an
FNH or hemangioma.  Recommend continued attention on follow up.

Endoscopy
Colonoscopy Findings:	
Protruding Lesions	A broad-based 5 cm mass with overlying
exudate was found in the cecum. Cold forceps biopsies were
performed for histology. Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were
noted.
Excavated Lesions	A single non-bleeding diverticulum was seen.
Impression:	Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Diverticulum in the colon
Mass in the cecum (biopsy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
EGD Findings:
Esophagus:	
Lumen:	A partial, nonobstructing Schatzki's ring was found. A
small size hiatal hernia was seen.
Stomach:	Normal stomach.
Duodenum:	Normal duodenum.
Impression:	Small hiatal hernia
Schatzki's ring
.
Pathology
Cecal mass biopsies: Focal adenomatous mucosa with at least high
grade dysplasia. No definitive invasive carcinoma is identified.
Additional levels examined. The biopsies may not be
representative of the entire "mass" described. Clinical
correlation is needed.


Brief Hospital Course:
