.
CT head [**12-30**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage. No fracture identified.
CXR [**12-26**]: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities
identified.
R Hip [**12-26**]: AP PELVIS AND RIGHT HIP, THREE VIEWS: There is a
subcapital fracture of the right femur with slight proximal
displacement of the distal fracture fragment. The right femoral
head appears to articulate with the right acetabulum without
evidence of dislocation. No other fractures are identified. Bony
mineralization is normal. There is slight asymmetry in the right
hemipelvis, which may be related to position. Degenerative
changes are seen at the L5-S1 level. The bowel gas pattern is
within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: Subcapital right femur fracture.
.
CT pelvis: IMPRESSION: No retroperitoneal hematoma. Small
intraabdominal ascites. Fluid surrounding the right hemipelvis
is consistent with patient's recent postoperative status.
.
CXR [**12-29**]: IMPRESSION: New left lower lobe opacity representing
airspace disease versus atelectasis. Stable right-sided
post-operative changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the medicine service for medical
clearance for orthopedic management of her right femur fracture.
 (Right femur fx - [**3-6**] mechanical fall. No symptoms or history
suggestive of syncopal episode. Needs OR repair, intermediate
risk surgery. Per ACC guideline, pt falls into minor clinical
predictors with excellent functional capacity. Is medically
clear for OR from cardiac standpoint, no need for additional
testing. Also medically clear from pulmonary standpoint given
baseline COPD and unremarkable CXR. Role of a peri-op BB
controversial in this low-risk pt (minor predictors, excellent
functional capacity, intermediate OR risk).

Patient was made NPO on midnight of HD 2 and taken to the OR
with orthopedics on HD 3.  Pt had R hip hemi-arthroplasty with
700 EBL and no other complications noted.

[**Name (NI) **] pt had an episode of hypotension, was difficult to weane
of ventilator and spiked a temperature to 102.  She was admitted
to the MICU, started on broad abx with ciprofloxacin for UTI and
also had vancomycin added empirically.  She defervesced on this
regimen and fever work-up revealed no other source of infection.
 Vancomycin was stopped after 72 hrs.  Plan to continue cipro
for 3 additional days for a total of 7 day course.
In addition, post-op course was complicated by hypotension
requiring pressors.  She required agressive fluid resuscitation
of about 8 L and 2 Units of PRBC and her hypotension resolved.
Anti-hypertensive medications were initially held and restarted
on [**12-31**].
Initially the pt had rapid atrial fibrillation in the setting of
hypotension and was started on IV digoxin.  No change in BP was
noted with better HR control.  Digoxin was discontinued with
good HR control throughout remainder of her stay and diltiazem
was restarted at home dose on [**12-31**].
She was maintained on atrovent nebulizer intermittently for COPD
with oxygen saturation around 95% on room air, and minimized
albuterol in the setting of atrial fibrillation.  Initial CXR
showed no infiltrate, repeat one at the time of fever showed a
questionable new infiltrate.  Pt had no clinical evidence of
pneumonia, consider repeat CXR in a few days to assess
resolution.
During her MICU stay, her platelets were noted to trend down to
94 in the setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.  Heparin
was held and HIT antibody was sent.  She was anticoagulated with
fondaparinux and plts increased to 168 on this regimen.  She
should be able to resume lovenox anticoagulation for post-op
prophylaxis should the HIT antibody prove to be negative.  HCT
was also noted to trend down
