Brief Hospital Course:
NSURG course:   Noncontrast head CT revealed bilateral frontal
contusions w/ SAH c/w trauma, though patient never told his
family about a past fall but is now nonverbal. Serial CTs show
stable contusion and stable SAH. Course also significant for new
ARF on CRI w/diuresis, resp failure, chf. Transferred to MICU
for further management of ongoing acute on chronic renal failure
and ventilator dependent.

MICU Course:  Pt transferred to MICU w/ stable frontal cerebral
contusions and SAH, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute on
chronic renal failure, CHF, and iron deficiency anemia.
  1.  Cerebral contusions/SAH:  on transfer, he had a stable
neuro exam:  nonverbal, unresponsive; moving both LE and the RUE
spontaneously; withdrawing all limbs from pain.  He was treated
with lopressor, hydralazine, and a nitrate to maintain SBP in
the 140s; his outpatient ASA and Plavix were held to avoid
exacerbating cerebral hemorrhage.  His neurological status
remained stable throughout his MICU stay.
  2.  Hypoxic respiratory failure:  the patient was intubated on
SIMV on transfer.  His respiratory failure was thought to be [**1-29**]
a combination of pulmonary edema and community acquired PNA.  He
had just finished a 10-day course of levaquin for PNA upon
transfer.  He was observed to have a variable respiratory drive,
often with poor minute ventilation, likely [**1-29**] neuro insult.  He
was transitioned from SIMV to MMV with maintenance of good O2
sats.  He underwent tracheostomy on [**7-2**] in preparation for
long-term ventilator dependence.  He received hemodialysis
multiple times in the MICU for fluid removal in order to proceed
towards extubation.  At DC, he remains stable on MMV with a
tenuous respiratory drive.
  3.  Acute on chronic renal failure:  on transfer, the pt
demonstrated ARF likely [**1-29**] overdiuresis in the setting of
intravascular volume depletion, with a creatinine of 4.1
(baseline 2-2.2).  He was treated with IV hydration to maintain
even fluid status, and underwent HD for total body fluid
removal.  His renal fxn improved over his MICU course, with
creatinine down to 2.9 at DC.
  4.  CHF:  on transfer, he had improving pulmonary edema [**1-29**]
CHF and hypoalbuminemia.  He was treated with lopressor,
hydralazine, and isosorbide dinitrate, with rapid resolution of
pulm edema.  On DC, he has no pulm edema by clinical exam.  Can
consider changing hydralazine/isosorbide over to ace-inhibitor
as tolerates as pt likely to remain on hemodialysis.
  5.  Anemia:  labs indicate an iron deficiency anemia, likely
[**1-29**] chronic slow GI bleed as stool is hemoccult positive.  On
[**6-30**] HCT dropped below 28; he received 1U PRBCs, with appropriate
increase in HCT to above 30.  HCT remained stable after
transfusion until DC.  Will start niferex given iron studies of
iron 36, ferritin 70, tibc 311.
  6. GI/FEN: Pt is s/p feeding tube placement.  He will continue
with his tube feeds.  Pt had episode of increased sodium which
had improved with free water boluses through his NG tube.
