Admission Date:  [**2140-9-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2140-9-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**2083-10-9**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU ORANG

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old female
with history of cirrhosis, sickle cell disease (SC variant),
end stage renal disease, on hemodialysis, hypertension, who
presents with fever during hemodialysis, temperature to 103??????.
The patient subsequently transferred to Emergency Department
where initial temperature 104.8??????.  Systolic blood pressure
120-130s, which then dropped to systolic blood pressures of
70s-80s.  The patient received a 500 cc normal saline bolus
times one without response in blood pressure and then started
on dopamine drip in the Emergency Department,  given concerns
by dialysis staff regarding change in mental status along
with fever.  Ms. [**Known lastname 106571**] also received a lumbar puncture and
received 2 gm of ceftriaxone times one.  Cerebrospinal fluid
was negative for white blood count and had a normal glucose,
high normal protein.  CSF Gram stain pending.  Given previous
history of MRSA in her sputum and mss in her peripheral blood
as well as an indwelling hemodialysis catheter, she was also
receiving vancomycin 1 gm intravenous times one.  She was
subsequently transferred to MICU and started on vasopressin
and Levophed with the weaning off of the dopamine.

Abdominal ultrasound in the Emergency Department with

noted.  Electrocardiogram - normal sinus rhythm at 82 beats
per minute, QRS 0.09, QTC 0.478, PR 0.156, LVH - no ST
changes compared to [**2140-9-20**] although evidence of RV strain.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Fevers.  Differential diagnosis includes line infection,
intraabdominal process, viral process, pneumonia, although no
evidence of pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, sickle cell
crisis (likely combination of an inciting event plus his
sickle cell crisis).  The patient was continued on Vancomycin
and ceftriaxone.  Flagyl was added to cover for
intraabdominal and aerobic organisms.  Blood cultures that
had been drawn in dialysis came back four out of four blood
cultures positive for Gram positive cocci.  Transplant
service was consulted and removed right tunnel catheter on
night of admission.  The patient initially received high dose
of steroids for suspected adrenal insufficiency.  However,
random cortisol came back at 47.2 and the steroids were
discontinued.  An infectious disease consult was obtained.
Per their recommendations, gentamicin was started.

2.  Hypotension.  Differential diagnosis included septic
which is felt to be most likely cardiogenic, hypovolemic.
Patient was started on Vasopressin and Levophed in the MICU,
as well as dopamine for cardiac stimulation as well as SVR
affect.  Dopamine was gradually weaned off.  Neo-Synephrine
was added for further pressure support.

Diastolic dysfunction.  The patient had a history of
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 55% and
on initial exam there was evidence of fluid overload as well
as on chest x-ray.  The patient's beta blocker was held,
however, even her hypotension.

3.  Respiratory.  Following admission to the MICU, the
patient had to increase oxygen requirement with increased
respiratory effort.  She was started on Bi-PAP but did not
tolerate it well and patient was very agitated on the Bi-PAP
despite Versed.  The patient was intubated on [**2140-9-27**].

4.  Colon.  The patient had a tender liver on exam in the
setting of increased LFTs from baseline.  The differential
diagnoses includes cholestasis, hemolysis, congestion
secondary to congestive heart failure, and sickle cell
crisis.  Given patient's rapidly deteriorating course, we
were unable to obtain an abdominal CAT scan.

5.  End stage renal disease.  The patient was followed by
renal service during her hospital stay.  But, given her
persistent hypotension, dialysis could not be performed
safely.

6.  Status.  Given the patient's rapidly deteriorating course
despite broad antibiotic coverage and pressure support, a
family meeting was held to discuss the goals of therapy.  The
patient's daughter, who was her health care proxy, decided to
remove pressor and ventilator support.  Shortly after removal
of pressor and ventilatory support, the patient progressed to
asystole.  Time of death 06:55 a.m. [**2140-9-28**].  The patient's
family consented to autopsy.
