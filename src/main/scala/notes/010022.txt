Admission Date:  [**2134-1-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2134-1-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2058-12-30**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Bloomguard Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
woman with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and
history of diverticulitis, who is status post elective
colectomy on [**2133-12-24**], who presented to the
emergency room on [**1-1**], one day after being discharged
postoperatively from the hospital.  At this time the patient
complained of pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea on exertion,
palpitations.  In the emergency room the patient was found to
be tachycardiac, systolic blood pressure in the 190s and a
CAT scan angiogram revealed evidence of a pulmonary embolism.
The patient was started on heparin drip at that time.  The
patient had an episode of oxygen desaturation and hypoxia in
the emergency room that was likely due to flash pulmonary
edema.  The patient was therefore admitted to the medical
intensive care unit where she was stabilized overnight with
Lasix and noninvasive ventilator assistance (Bi-PAP).  The
patient was then transferred to the medicine floor on
[**1-3**].  Upon arrival to the medicine floor the patient
complained of tachycardia and de-conditioning, but otherwise
had no complaints and was breathing comfortably.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
diverticulitis, status post elective colectomy on [**2133-12-24**], anxiety, history of myocarditis/cardiomyopathy,
status post catheterization unknown time that showed no
coronary artery disease.

MEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER:  Tylenol p.r.n., lisinopril 10
once a day, Diltiazem p.r.n., paroxetine 10 q.d., Colace,
pravastatin, heparin drip, Lasix 20 b.i.d., Coumadin 5
loading dose.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Cardizem 240, lisinopril 10,
pravastatin 40, Ativan 0.5, Paxil 10.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives in [**Hospital3 **], denies tobacco or other
drug use.  Occasionally drinks alcohol socially and the
patient's husband is currently an inpatient at [**Hospital1 **] as well.

DIAGNOSTICS ON ADMISSION:  CAT scan angiogram on [**1-1**],
showed pulmonary emboli within the right lower lobe segmental
artery branches and left upper lobe branch.  The patient's
CBC was within normal limits, her hematocrit remained stable
in the mid 30 range and was normocytic.  The patient's
urinalysis on [**1-1**], was within normal limits without
evidence of infection.  The patient's electrolytes were
within normal limits and her cardiac enzymes were less than
0.01 troponin T x3 checks.  Echocardiogram completed on
[**2134-1-1**], and then repeat echocardiogram on [**2134-1-4**], revealed normal left ventricular cavity size,
overall left ventricular systolic function moderately
depressed, however, improved slightly between the two dates
of [**1-1**] and [**1-4**].  Also showed 2+ mitral
regurgitation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary embolism:  The patient's pulmonary embolism in
a setting of postoperative course likely related to her
decreased mobility perioperatively.  The patient was
continued on heparin drip until [**1-5**], after the
patient's INR had been therapeutic for 48 hours.  The patient
was loaded on Coumadin beginning on [**1-2**] and at
discharge her INR was fairly stable at a dose of 2.5 Coumadin
q.h.s.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] for
further dosing of her Coumadin and INR checks.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient with history of
cardiomyopathy and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
The patient's ejection fraction estimated at 20 to 25% on the
echocardiogram on [**1-1**], however, it was estimated to
be slightly improved and had an ejection fraction of 30 to
35% on repeat echo on [**2134-1-4**].  The patient's
slight improvement likely related to her improved overall
status and a depressed ejection fraction on [**1-1**], was
measured during an acute exacerbation of her cardiovascular
status.  The patient remained somewhat tachycardia especially
with activity throughout her hospital stay.  This was likely
related to deconditioning as well as her recent
cardiovascular decompensation in setting of a pulmonary
embolism.  The patient was monitored closely and will be
followed as an outpatient for this.  Cardiology was consulted
while the patient was in the hospital and they recommended
starting a beta blocker, which was started on [**1-5**].
The patient was also changed from an ACE inhibitor to
angiotensin to receptor blocker due to side effect of a
cough.  Per the cardiology recommendations the patient was
continued on Diltiazem and Lipitor as well as Lasix 40 p.o.
b.i.d.  The house staff also spoke to the patient's
outpatient cardiologist and received information from an old
echo, which also showed a global hypokinesis.  That
echocardiogram had been performed approximately 3 to 4 months
prior to this admission.  The cardiology consult also
recommended that the patient follow up with her outpatient
cardiologist for possible exercise stress test approximately
one month after discharge.

3.  Diverticulitis, status post colectomy:  The patient's
colectomy site was clean, dry and intact.  The patient was
followed by surgery, who performed the operation throughout
her hospital stay.

4.  Anxiety:  The patient's anxiety likely worsened given her
difficult family issues, with her husband also being in the
hospital as a patient.  The patient was maintained on low
dose Ativan as needed.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Furosemide 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Diltiazem 240 mg sustained released p.o. q.d., paroxetine 10
mg once a day, pravastatin 40 mg once a day, Colace 100 mg
tablet twice a day as needed for constipation, losartan 25 mg
p.o. q.d., Warfarin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s., metoprolol 12.5 mg
b.i.d., Lorazepam 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**] within one month.  The patient is also to follow up
with her outpatient cardiologist within one month.
