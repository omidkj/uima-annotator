right jaw. EKG with poor RV progression and T inversion in V1,
troponins slightly elevated. Cardiac catheterization showed 85%
proximal LAD stenosis, 99% RCA lesion with left to right
collaterals and 75% stenosis of the circumflex with normal EF.

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT [**2132-3-26**]: 1. Substantial enlargement of the right thyroid
lobe that potentially may contribute to the abnormality
demonstrated on the chest radiograph. The assessment of the
right thyroid lobe with ultrasound is suggested. 2. Mild
centrilobular emphysema. Pulmonary nodules as described that
should be reevaluated in three months for assessment of their
stability based on the size of the largest nodule. 3. Sparing of
the ascending aorta from calcifications. 4. Enlarged kidney
cyst. 5. Small hiatal hernia.
.
Echo [**2134-3-31**]: PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are both simple and complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. The left coronary cusp has poor leaflet excursion.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results in the operating room.
POST-BYPASS: Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Aorta is intact post decannulation. Rest of the examination is
unchanged.
.

CXR: [**2134-4-3**]: he small left apical pneumothorax is no longer
seen and has resolved. There is atelectasis at the left base.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is
cardiomegaly and mediastinotomy wires identified. There are no
signs for overt pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname 40188**] was transferred from
outside hospital after cath revealed severe coronary artery
disease. Upon admission she was surgical worked up and received
medical management. Following work-up she was brought to the
operating room on [**2134-3-31**] and underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft x 4. Please see operative note for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Later this day she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On
post-op day one she was started on beta-blocker and diuretics
and gently diuresed back to her pre-op weight. Later this day
she was transferred to the step-down floor for further care.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. She remained in sinus rhythm 50-60's, blood pressure
100-118.  She was restarted on her Metform 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] with blood
sugars 116-160's.  Her Actos was held and should be restarted as
an outpatient. She noted to have mild confusions while on
narcotics. She was changed to tramadol with improvement in her
mental status and good pain control. She worked with physical
therapy for strength and mobility.  She continued to make steady
progress and was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 3597**] NH
[**Telephone/Fax (1) **]. She will follow-up as an outpatient.
