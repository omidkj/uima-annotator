hemorrhage, likely originating in the thalamus and extending

Head CT:
 1. Large intracranial hemorrhage in the left hemisphere with
involvement of the bilateral lateral ventricles and 3rd
ventricle. There is mild shift of the rightward shift of the
midline structures, and significant diffuse brain edema with
effacement of all of the sulci. Unfortunately the comparison is
not avaiable.
 2. There is loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation a
portion of the left parietal lobe.
 3. Fluid blood level is noted in the left temporal lobe, of
uncertain clinical significance.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  48-year-old woman w/ h/o HIV/AIDS, chronic HCV, asthma was
admitted to MICU w/ spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, now
transferred to Medicine for continued palliative care.

1. Intracerebral hemorrhage:  she was found unresponive by her
boyfriend at home, and was taken to [**Hospital1 2177**] where head CT
demonstrated large intracerebral hemorrhage as per the HPI.  At
[**Hospital1 18**], repeat head CT confirmed left sided intracerebral
hemorrhage causing midline shift.  This was of unclear etiology.
 Possible causes include aneurysm, occult trauma, cocaine use w/
subsequent HTN, and spontaneous bleed in the setting of
coagulopathy.  She was admitted to the MICU, placed on SIMV, and
did not show spontaneous breathing.  Admission exam was notable
for upgoing Babinski, no corneal reflexes, possible posturing to
pain, and fixed dilated pupils.  She was initially treated w/
mannitol to reduce intracerebral pressure and loaded w/ dilantin
for seizure prevention.  Evaluation by Neurosurgery confirmed
that she was not a surgical candidate.  Neurology evaluation
indicated very poor prognosis, and virtually no chance of
meaningful recovery.  The pt spent 5 days in the MICU in which
she did not demonstrate any functional improvement.  On HD#5, a
family meeting was held that resulted in a decision by the
family to pursue palliative care.  The pt was extubated at that
time and was started on morphine gtt for comfort.  She was then
transferred to the Medicine floor for ongoing palliative care.
Treatment was continued w/ morphine gtt, ativan prn for
agitation, and scopolamine patch to control production of
secretions.  She appeared to be comfortable during the rest of
her hospital stay.  She died on [**2148-4-12**].  The next of [**Doctor First Name **]
declined post-mortem examination.
