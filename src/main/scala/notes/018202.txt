Chief Complaint:
Weakness, nausea, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
85F h/o HTN, cerebral hemorrhage, recent cellulitis who presents
s/p fall from home. Patient states that since Wednesday she has
been vomiting following taking in liquids or solids. Is unclear
how long after eating this occurs. Denies hematemesis. Has not
been able to take any POs. Denies fevers / chills / rashes /
rigors / cough / sob / DOE / CP / changes in bowel habits. In
this setting, describes increased weakness. Reports that 1d PTA
she was walking across the room when she states that she
tripped. Denies LH / dizziness / visual changes / diaphoresis.
States that her R leg, which has been residually weak since the
intraventricular hemorrhage, had been feeling slightly more
"weak". Fell to the floor. Denies LOC/hitting head. Denies any
localizing pain following the fall.
.

.
ECG: sinus, 80 bpm, L axis, LBBB
.
CXR ([**2-15**]): There is a mild scoliosis of thoracic spine.  The
cardiac size is at the upper limits of normal, some tortuosity
of the aorta is present.  The costophrenic angles appear clear,
no definite failure is seen, no infiltrates are identified.
.
Shoulder x-ray, left ([**2-15**]): Mild-to-moderate glenohumeral
osteoarthritis.  No acute fracture or dislocation. Equivocal
airspace opacity projecting over the visualized portion of the
left lung. Diagnostic considerations include mild pulmonary
edema, although this
is incompletely assessed on these left shoulder radiographs.
.
Hip x-ray, bilateral ([**2-15**]): No fracture.
.
CT head, non-contrast ([**2-15**]): No evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage.  Chronic bilateral middle cerebral artery territory
infarcts.
.
KUB ([**2-15**]): No prior studies are available.  The bowel gas
pattern is unremarkable.  Stool and air are present in the
rectum.  There is no evidence of free air. IMPRESSION:  No
evidence of bowel obstruction.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**2-15**]): 1.5-cm synovial cyst from the right facet
joint at L4-L5 level with severe facet degenerative changes and
mild spondylolisthesis of L4 over L5 resulting in severe spinal
stenosis.  The synovial cyst has increased in size compared with
the previous MRI of [**2136-4-21**].  Multilevel degenerative changes
are noted as before.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**2-19**]): (preliminary read) No acute CVA.
.
TTE ([**9-/2129**]):
1. The aortic valve leaflets appear sclerotic and calcified, but
open
well.
 2. The mitral valve leaflets appear thickened, but open well.
Trace
mitral regurgitation is present.
 3. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
 4. The left ventricle is normal in size. The left ventricle is
normal in wall thickness. Left ventricular ejection fraction is
mildly reduced (45-55%). Hypokinetic interventricular septum.
Hypokinetic inferior wall.

Brief Hospital Course:
85F h/o HTN, cerebral hemorrhage p/w nausea and vomiting and
mechanical fall with increased LE weakness, hyponatremia, and
cellulitis.
.
# Hyponatremia: Resolved. Baseline Na+ 130, likely [**3-15**] reset
osmostat or SIADH. Acute decompensation probably [**3-15**] hypovolemia
and poor PO intake due to nausea/vomiting. TSH and [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim
normal. Repleted 1L NS (calculated deficit 160 mmols) gently
@100cc/h to Na of 126 while in MICU, now euvolemic and at
baseline on fluid restriction of 1.5 L. Na+ 136 at discharge.
Followup with PCP.
.
# RLE cellulitis: Improving. Swab from prior ED visit grew out
coagulase negative staphylococcus and enterococcus (no
sensitivities performed). No history of VRE. Patient reports not
improved on bactrim, keflex (but with nausea and vomiting
unlikely much absorbtion). Ulceration present but not
overwhelming cellulitis on examination, and patient remained
afebrile. She was given unasyn and vancomycin for 6 days, then
transitioned to linezolid PO to complete a 10 day course.
Continued wound care for ulceration. Followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] after
completes antibiotics for evaluation. [**Month (only) 116**] need outpatient CBC
given linezolid, although very short course.
.
# Hypoxia: Noted at presentation to ED, resolved spontaneously
on HD#1. Unclear etiology. CXR with no failure, infiltrate.
Elevated D-dimer but non-diagnostic in setting of recent trauma;
low clinical suspicion for PE. Respiratory status stable at
discharge.
.
# Neuro: 1) h/o spinal stenosis with lumbar radiculopathy 2)
polyneuropathy 3) h/o cerebral hemorrhage s/p temp shunt, right
craniotomy 4) se
