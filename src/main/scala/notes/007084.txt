Brain MR:
1. Innumerable nodular enhancing foci predominantly in a
watershed distribution in the cerebrum but also within the
cerebellum with associated edema. A focus of restricted
diffusion in the right posterior parietal region without
evidence of minimal hemorrhage appears to represent a small
associated infarction. Given the watershed distribution, small
vessel vasculitis should be considered in the differential
diagnosis. The appearance and distribution is not classical for
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The differential diagnosis
also includes an unusual encephalitis, sarcoidosis, or other
granulomatous disorder.

2. Normal Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] MRA.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and managed for her headache and loss
of consciousness.  She was initially intubated and sent to the
NICU.  Her head MRI showed multiple white matter lesions
consistent with a leukoencephalopathy of unclear etiology.  An
LP was done which was unrealing.  A rheumatology consult was
obtained to help us work up a possible cerebral
vasculitis/angitis.  An EEG showed bursts of generalized
slowing. A brain biopsy was performed which showed "acute
hemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy".  She was started initially on
iv steroids and then switched to po steroids in addition to
seizure prophylaxis with phenytoin.  Her neurologic exam
improved over the course of her stay to where she was more alert
and oriented.  Her speech became more fluent.  She still
remained with a mild left hemi-neglect and weakness in the
distal left extremities.
