Dialysis


History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 yo F with h/o poorly-controlled HTN, ESRD, and DM
p/w cough and SOB. The cough was initially dry for 2 weeks, but
is now productive of white sputum. Over the weekend it worsened
in frequency and severity. She has cough-associated chest and
b/t shoulder pain. She reports dyspnea over the past 3 days and
worsened leg and abdominal swelling. She denies F/C/S. She is on
HD MWF and has not missed a session.
.
On presentation to the ED her BP was 231/84 with HR = 67, SaO2
92% RA. She was unable to complete sentences and had rales
half-way up her chest. She was started on a nitro gtt which was
titrated up to 100 mcg/min with BP = 183/67. Renal was consulted
for urgent dialysis but felt that the patient could wait until
the morning. She was evaluated by the MICU attending who felt
that she could be managed on the floor with a nitro gtt. She
also received lasix 100 mg IV (no urine output response),
morphine 2 mg IV, and regular insulin 10 units.
.

.
Studies:
CXR ([**3-4**]): The cardiac silhouette is slightly decreased in size
from [**2158-12-28**], where a pericardial effusion was
suspected. The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, however. The
aorta is calcified. There is no pneumonia or congestive failure.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
.
Echo ([**2158-12-29**]): The LA is moderately dilated. The RA is
moderately dilated. The estimated RA pressure is 11-15mmHg.
There is mild symmetric LVH. The LV cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The RV cavity is mildly dilated.
RV systolic function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No AR
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] TR is seen. The tricuspid
regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be underestimated. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-9-5**],
tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
* Hypertensive Urgency: The patient was compliant with all
medications except Imdur.  She was restarted on her home
medications labetolol, lisinopril, nifedipine, hydralazine,
clonidine, and imdur.  We titrated up her labetalol and changed
to TID while hospitalized.  The patient was also likely fluid
overloaded and underwent daily dialysis to remove extra fluid.
Upon discharge the pt's SBP was between 120-160.  The patient
agreed to follow up with her pcp for further management of her
medications and medications.
.
* ESRD on HD: The patient underwent hemodialysis daily while
hospitalized without complications to remove excess fluid as the
likely cause of her hypertension.
.
* DM: While in the hospital the patient had multiple episodes of
hypoglycemia.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted, and the patients lantus
dose was decreased.  The patient is to follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] as
an outpatient
