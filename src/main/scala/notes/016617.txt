Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, vomiting


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-12-19**] endotracheal intubation
[**2187-12-19**] femoral central venous catheter placed

History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain with
nausea and vomiting for about 2 days. +obstipation Patient lives
at a group home due to hx of cerebral palsy and mental
retardation. Staff at house noticed patient more lethargic and
pale. Did not report any fevers. No known aspiration event. Sent
to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].

At OSH patient had NGT placed with feculant material output. CT
abd was consistent WITH SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION AT THE SITE OF A
LARGE PARASTOMAL HERNIA. Patient became hypotensive and was
intubated for airway protection. He received 2 L of crystalloid
with appropriate increase in his blood preussure. A right
femoral CVL was placed after failed attempt at Left IJ. He
received IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Surgery consult at
[**Location (un) 620**] recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
his SBO.

At [**Hospital1 18**] ED the patient was hemodynamically stable. A surgery
consult was placed and evaluated the patient. Believed that
patient had illeus and did not have mechanical obstruction.
Recommended medical management and will continue to follow the
patient.

In the ED, initial VS were: HR 110s, BP 94/72, RR 14 on FiO2
100%.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and sedated.
Hemodynamically stable not on pressors.

IMAGING:
     [**2187-12-19**]

     CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:

     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Abdominal discomfort

     Multidetector CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed
with
     intravenous infusion of 150 cc Omnipaque 300.  The study
was somewhat
     limited because of the patient's inability to fully
cooperate.
     Comparison is made with the previous examination done
[**2184-6-6**].

     An enterostomy has been placed in the left mid abdomen in
the
     interval.  The anatomy of the enterostomy is unclear but a
narrowed
     segment of large bowel and fluid and air-filled small bowel
enter a
     parastomal hernia.  The small bowel appears constricted
where it
     enters the hernia but dilated within it and there are
multiple dilated
     air and fluid-filled loops of small bowel proximal to this
site.  Gas
     and fecal material are present in the colon, proximal and
distal to
     the site.  The large bowel is not dilated.  Cholelithiasis
is
     redemonstrated.  There is no pericholecystic fluid or
gallbladder wall
     thickening.  The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands
and kidneys
     are unremarkable in appearance, as before.  The stomach is
somewhat
     distended by fluid and air.  Scattered atherosclerotic
calcification
     is present as before.  Visualized pelvic structures are
unremarkable.
     There is persistent mild compression deformity of the L1
vertebral
     body and there are accompanying degenerative arthritic
changes in the
     spine, which appear stable.

     IMPRESSION:

     FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION AT THE
SITE OF A
     LARGE PARASTOMAL HERNIA.  THE SURGICAL ANATOMY IS UNCLEAR
AND
     [**Name2 (NI) 88087**]N WITH THE PATIENT'S CLINICAL HISTORY IS
RECOMMENDED.

     CHOLELITHIASIS.

.
[**2187-12-24**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. No valvular pathology or
pathologic flow identified. Dilated aortic sinus.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2183**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

CT abdomen [**2188-1-1**]:

IMPRESSION:
1. Dilated loops of small bowel are seen proximal and distal to
the
parastomal hernia, suggesting an ileus, although partial
obstruction cannot be
fully excluded. This study is somewhat limited due to motion. If
clinical
suspicion continues to exist for mechanical obstruction, would
recommend
repeat CT.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
3. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old male with a history of cerebral
palsy and colostomy surgery who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with
constipation and was found to have herniation around his prior
stoma.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after intubation at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for
airway protection given large volumes of feculent vomiting.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:

#Small bowel obstruction (SBO/Ileus): Patient presented with
obstipation for 2 days.  CT consistent with SBO with peristomal
hernia.  Surgery evaluated the patient and did not feel that
this is a mechanical SBO as his hernia was reducable. There was
no other significant pathology on the CT scan.  Nasogastric tube
was placed to continue to suction the feculent material in his
stomach.  He recieved fleets and mineral oil enemas through the
stoma, miralax and GoLytely through the NGT and he was kept NPO.
 This resulted in small amounts of stomal output after a few
days.  Surgery recommended that we can slowly start tube feeds
and monitor stool output.
