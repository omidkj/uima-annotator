CTA: no pe, RLL infiltrate.

ECG: Sinus tach @115, RBBB, STd in V2-V4.

CT head: progression of MCA infarct

Brief Hospital Course:
77yo m w/ cad, chf now w/ acute respiratory failure (hypoxemic),
RLL infiltrate, and failure to respond to Lasix.

1) Resp failure -likely [**2-14**] PNA. Pt had low cvp ([**1-16**]) on
admission and RLL infiltrate c/w PNA.  Started on zosyn and
vancomycin for coverage of nosocomial infection.  Pt was
received intubated and was remained on the ventilator until
hospital day 6.  The patient had some difficulty preparing to
wean from the vent, with RSBIs around 100.  His respiratory
status was limited by copious secreations.  On previous
admission, h/o developing acute pulmonary edema, so the patient
was diuresed prior to extubation.  He was maintained on a nitro
gtt titrated to bp approx 110 systolic during the extubation
period, but was rapidly titrated off once stable on NC.  On
discharge, slightly elev rr in high 20s, sating 96% on ra.
Patient should complete seven more days of zosyn and vancomycin.
.
2) CAD- ST depression present on ECG at admission concerning for
demand ischemia.  Initial troponin elevated, and subsequent
troponins also mildly increased (approx 0.3).  Low clinical
probability for ACS given negative cks and story c/w increased
demand.  ECG changes resolved on Hospital day 1 following
stabilization of his respiratory status. Pt was continued on his
metoprolol at the dose of 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], and statin, his ACEI had
been held to allow for additional BP room for diuresis with
lasix.  The patient was re-started on his ACE inhibitor
(lisinopril 2.5mg once daily) and aggrenox at time of discharge.
In addition, he was also maintained on lasix 20mg PO once daily
to maintain euvolemia while admitted.
.
3) Hypernatremia- Initial sodium of 153 suggested a 4L free
water deficit on admission.  Deficit was corrected over >48
hours w/ free water boluses and D5W.  Loss likely [**2-14**] to
overdiuresis w/ furosemide given hx and initially low cvp.  To
prevent further episodes of hypernatremia, suggest maintaining
free water intake in the form of free water flushed with tube
feeds.
.
4) Thyroid- continued outpatient synthroid.
