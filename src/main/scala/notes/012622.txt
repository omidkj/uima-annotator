this current SOB does not feel like his prior asthma
exacerbations. Also notes increased LE edema bilaterally x 1

more fluid. Recently increased pillows from 2 to 4. No

Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo male with history of asthma & HTN who presented with 2
weeks of progressive shortness of breath likely due to acute
bronchitis and allergies triggering a severe asthma flare.

#Asthma exacerbation:
He was initially admitted to the ICU and transferred to floor
medical service quickly, not needing NIPPV. He received standing
nebs and was started on prednisone 60mg daily which he was
discharged to continue for 10 days without a taper. His flovent
110mcg was also stepped up to Adavir 100/50 and singulair was
added given his history of allergies and his recollection of
symptoms after being in a truck that smelled like an animal had
been there. He was discharged to follow up with his new
pulmonologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4011**].

#Acute bronchitis:
Upon presentation in addition to shortness of breath patient had
copious amounts of dark thick green sputum production with mild
hypoxia and clear CXR. Sputum cxs with neutrophil predominance
showed GPC in pairs and clusters and GPR and cx grew commensal
flora. Given initial gram stain data patient was treated with
CTX and azithromycin. However, he did not have significant
improvement in his symptoms with this medication so he was
changed from ceftriaxone to augmentin to complete a total of an
8 day course. His symptoms seemed to improve slowly when changed
to augmentin (to cover bronchitis from MSSA).

#Probable OSA: Patient should have outpatient sleep study and
outpatient PFTs.

#HTN: Patient was hypertensive during admission. THis was felt
to be due to respiratoy work of breathing. BPs improved over
admission. Although unlikely to be playing a role, his BB was
changed to Diltiazem for BP and HR control and his amlodipine
and HCTZ were continued. An echo showed symmetric LVH so his BPs
should be controlled aggressively upon discharge when his
respiratory status is back to baseline. He at no time received
diuretics for CHF.

#Left rotator cuff tear:  Patient takes naproxen at home.
