Service:  C-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic
insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, asthma, and chronic renal
insufficiency, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**Hospital3 **] following an
episode of respiratory distress.

Four days prior to admission the patient had fallen at home
and was taken to [**Hospital1 **] where hip films
indicated no fracture.  He was discharged to [**Hospital3 1761**] short-term unit where he received Tylenol
No. 3 as well as Ambien.  On the morning of admission, the
patient became confused, anxious, and dyspneic with a
respiratory rate in the 40s, and oxygen saturation dropping
to 70% on 2 liters; this improved to 95% on a 40% face mask.
The patient was also noted to have recently developed zoster
in the right fifth cranial nerve, ophthalmic division
distribution.

The patient was taken to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 **], again, on [**9-10**], which is the date of
admission, where his vital signs were stable; however, his
mental status was still altered.  Electrocardiogram indicated
atrial flutter at a rate of 110.  He was given Lopressor,
nitroglycerin paste, Levaquin, Lasix, acyclovir, and
Captopril in the Emergency Department with better rate
control.  The patient also had lower extremity noninvasive
Doppler studies which were negative.  According to the
patient's son, the patient has been agitated and not himself
since admission to the [**Hospital3 **] four days prior
to admission.  The patient also has baseline changes of
[**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] respiration; however, his baseline mental
status is extremely lucid per the patient's family.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired ophthalmologist
from [**State 350**] Eye & Ear Infirmary.  He denies smoking or
alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was a
somnolent and arousable elderly gentleman, slightly agitated,
in no acute distress.  He was afebrile with a heart rate
of 72, respiratory rate of 24, blood pressure of 170/58,
oxygen saturation 95% on 2.5 liters.  HEENT examination
indicated zoster in a cranial nerve V division 1 distribution
on the right.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Extraocular muscles were intact.  The oral mucosa was
dry.  The patient had a right subconjunctival hemorrhage.
The neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.  The
chest indicated reduced breath sounds at the bases.  No
wheezes, rhonchi or rales.  Cardiovascular examination
indicated a regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  A [**1-4**]
decrescendo diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal
border and a soft systolic murmur at the apex.  The abdomen
was soft, with mild diffuse tenderness, without guarding or
rebound.  It was not distended.  There were normal abdominal
bowel sounds, and no hepatosplenomegaly.  The extremity
examination indicated peripheral pulses that were 2+.  No
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  On neurologic examination, the
patient was somnolent but arousable, oriented to person,
month, and year only.  He had a positive oculocephalic gag
and corneal reflexes, was moving all four extremities.
Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric.  Toes were upgoing
bilaterally.

LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial laboratory
studies indicated a creatine kinase of 90, MB negative,
troponin of 0.3.  Chem-7 with sodium of 140, potassium 5.3,
chloride 110, bicarbonate 28, BUN 72, creatinine 2.1, glucose
of 131.  White blood cell count 10.8, hematocrit 36.5,
platelets 175.  PT 23.4, PTT 34.8, INR of 3.6.  An initial
arterial blood gas indicated a pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 52, and
PO2 of 77.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray indicated stable mediastinal
widening and aortic root dilatation with a tracheal shift to
the right which was old.  There were small bilateral pleural
effusions that were unchanged.

Lower extremity noninvasive Doppler studies were negative as
was a urinalysis.

Electrocardiogram #1 indicated atrial flutter at a rate
of 111 with 2:1 conduction, left axis deviation, left
ventricular hypertrophy, Q waves in leads III and aVF, ST
depressions in V4 through V6, and a T wave inversion in I and
aVL.

Electrocardiogram #2 indicated a rate of 72, continued atrial
flutter with persistent electrocardiogram changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to the
C-MED Service for rule out of myocardial infarction as well
as for management of altered mental status.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial
infarction.  He remained in atrial flutter with heparin for
anticoagulation.  He was occasionally tachycardic to the low
100s which was treated successfully times two with
intravenous Lopressor.

An echocardiogram indicated mild left ventricular
hypertrophy, moderately decreased left ventricular function,
2+ aortic regurgitation, and 1+ mitral regurgitation, 4+
tricuspid regurgitation, as well as severe cor pulmonale and
severe pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's rate remained stable in the 70s to 80s, in
atrial flutter throughout the remainder of his hospital stay
until the last few hours prior to the patient's expiration.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  An Infectious Disease consultation
was obtained on the first day of hospitalization.  Per
Infectious Disease recommendations, the patient had a lumbar
puncture which indicated 45 white blood cells in tube #1, 28
white blood cells in tube #4, and elevated protein at 67,
normal opening pressure, and normal glucose.  A VVV PCR from
the patient's cerebrospinal fluid was sent for analysis and
was still pending at the time of the patient's demise;
however, ultimately, the VVV PCR was read as negative.

The patient was started on intravenous acyclovir and
maintained on this throughout his hospital course.  An MRI of
the head indicated moderate atrophy, small vessel disease.
No evidence of meningoencephalitis.  No hematoma or mass
effect.

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient continued to exhibit
[**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] respiration throughout his hospital course.
Serial blood gases indicated PCO2 in the 70s to 80s; however,
this did not always correlate with the patient's mental
status.  Two times over the course of the hospitalization,
the patient was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit in
order to receive BiPAP treatment overnight.  Each time the
patient was returned to the floor with some improvement in
mental status as well as in PCO2; however, again, the patient
would revert to a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status with
elevated PCO2
