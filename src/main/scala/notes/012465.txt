Chief Complaint:
Weakness, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1726**] is an 83M with hx parosysmal Afib not on coumadin,
CAD s/p CABG in [**2135**] with LIMA to LAD which is totally occluded
after D1, SVG-D1 (stent in graft), SVG-OM (chronically
occluded), with most recent PCI in [**5-26**] with stenting Lcx, s/p
hip replacement, with hx chronic c.diff infection x 5 years. Pt
was in USOH until the night prior to admission when he noted
that he was unable to get up out of bed secondary to weakness,
which he noted was worse in his legs than in his arms. He
struggled to get OOB for a while, eventually becoming SOB, with
subsequent mid sternal sharp non radiating chest pain
experienced, similar to his anginal episodes. The pain was not
associated with diaphoresis or nausea, p.o intake, there was no
positional or pleuritic component. He took SLNTG x1 and the CP
resolved. He continued to experience this weakness on the day of
admission, called life line, with EMS sent to his home. On
arrival he was noted to have ? NSVT on monitor. Of note, he has
experienced several days of diarrhea with 10 or more loose
stools a day. Increased from baseline.
.
In the ER, initial VS were T97.1, HR 150, BP 73/54 -> 86/59, RR
36, O2 100% NRB. EKG showed wide complex tachycardia afib with
aberancy. Having CP. Labs notable for WBC 26, Cr 1.9 from
baseline 1.3. Underwent cardioversion for A. Fib with
hypotension and subsequently converted to sinus rhythm with
resolution of his chest pain. CXR negative for PNA. Overall
impression was for sepsis [**2-24**] C. diff and patient given
metronidazole for his diarrhea and 2L of IVF. Prior to transfer
had been making urine >800cc.
.
Vitals prior to transfer HR72 113/70 17 100%2L.
.
ROS is notable for chronic fatigue. He denies recent URIs,
cough, hemoptysis, fever, chills, rigors, diaphoresis, abdominal
pain, sick contacts, travel, prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, black stools or red
stools. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On arrival to the CCU he was seen to be in slow A.fib on EKG,
and hypotensive to the high 80s. IVF boluses were initiated with
subsequent improvement in pressure.  He was found to have GNR on
blood culture and was started on IV vanc/flagyll. He was started
on amniodorone drip .


Past Medical History:
-CAD with stable angina, s/p CABG '[**35**], multiple stents (last
cath report [**5-26**]: Two vessel CAD. Patent LIMA-LAD. Patent
SVG-D1. SVG-OM is known to be chronically occluded. The LCx had

70% in-stent stenosis in the proximal stent. There was a 70%
lesion just distal to the stent. Successful PTCA of the LCX.)
-Moderate systolic CHF - LVEF of 35%-40% on echo in [**5-30**]
-Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension - TR gradient
of 49 mmHg on echo in [**5-30**]
-A-fib (paroxysmal)previously on coumadin but not currently
taking
-hemoperitoneum around the liver and in the pelvis along with
two splenic artery pseudoaneurysms s/p IR embolization of both
in [**11/2155**]
-NSTEMI in the setting of acute blood loss anemia during
hospitalization in [**11/2155**]
- H/o C Diff - found in [**2152**], on chronic PO vanco at home; when

taken off vanco, has frequent diarrhea and dehydration
-HTN
-Hyperlipidemia
-Anemia
-Prostate CA s/p XRT (over 10 years ago), s/p TURP [**1-11**]
-s/p discectomy [**9-25**]
-Left hip arthroplasty [**12-26**]
-Severe osteoarthritis
