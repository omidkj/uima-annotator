Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old man who on
date of admission was walking to his bedroom, had the worst
headache of his life, which required him to sit down on the
floor.  His significant other called EMS, and the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital3 **], where a CAT scan showed
subarachnoid hemorrhage with possible anterior communicating
aneurysm.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital 10908**] and then here to [**Hospital1 69**]
for coiling of an aneurysm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for asthma.

Seasonal allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. MDI inhaler.
2. Albuterol inhaler.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has a 1-1/2 pack per day tobacco abuse x
20 years.  Occasionally he uses alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99 degrees, heart rate 93,
respirations 22, blood pressure 137/47.  HEENT:  Pupils equal
and reactive to light.  Lungs:  Clear.  Neck was supple.
Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  Hypoactive  bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No clubbing, 2 plus pedal pulses.  Neurologic
examination:  He is awake, alert and oriented x 3.  Follows
commands.  His face was symmetric.  Tongue was midline.  No
drift.  Grips and IPs were full.  Sensory:  Sensation was
intact to pinprick.  He did have positive nystagmus.

LABORATORY DATA:  CTA was performed which showed a wide-neck
anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

Other laboratory data:  Sodium 139, potassium 4.2, chloride
104, CO2 25, BUN 13.  White count was 21.9, hematocrit 49,
platelets 288.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9224**] service.  He was
brought to the endovascular, cerebrovascular laboratory,
where he underwent a coiling of ruptured anterior
communicating artery aneurysms.  The aneurysm was
approximately 7 x 4 mm with a 2.5 mm neck.  There is a
cavernous aneurysm noticed in the left ICA.  No other
intracerebral aneurysms were noted.  He was transferred to
the ICU where he was awake, alert and oriented x 3.  He had a
ventriculostomy drain placed.  It is not clear when it was
placed whether here or at [**Hospital 4415**].  He was
following commands.  Tongue was midline.  Face was symmetric.
Motor strengths were intact bilaterally.  His groin site
appeared soft without ecchymosis at the site of the
angiogram.  Postoperative labs were within normal limits.
His ABG was 7.31, 52, and 442.  He was started on nimodipine,
Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, Colace, Protonix, and also
Ancef for drain prophylaxis.  He had a drip of Nipride and
esmolol to keep his blood pressure less than 130.  On his
first postoperative day, he was awake, aware that he was in a
hospital in [**Location (un) 86**].  His face was symmetric.  His hematocrit
was 36.3, which is a slight drop from 40 on admission.  His
ventriculostomy drain was kept at 15 mm above the tragus.
His ICP ranged from 4 to 12.  Blood pressures were in the 90s
to 150s over 50s to 80s.  On the second postoperative day, he
was started on heparin.  His ICPs were noted to be in the 8
to 12 range.  He remained neurologically intact.  On
[**2114-7-11**], he was started on HHH therapy.  He complained of
some bad headaches.  His blood pressure goal was 160 to 180
either using albumin 25 mg every 6 hours as needed, and he
was receiving Neo-Synephrine at 1.2 mg/kg.  On [**2114-7-14**], his
parameters for his HHH therapy were raised; blood pressure
was asked to be in the 180 level.  He did have TCDs done on
[**2114-7-14**] which showed velocities in the right MCA, and ACA
remained in the upper range of normal, 110 to 120 for MCA.
Velocities in the left MCA and ACA were decreased in the 120
to 130, which is an improvement from prior examinations.  On
[**2114-7-16**] Levophed was added along with Neo-Synephrine to keep
his blood pressure in the 160 to 180 range.  His ICP remained
in 7 to 13 ranges.  CVPs were 3 to 6.  He remained
neurologically intact with occasional headaches.  TCDs from
[**2114-7-15**] showed decreasing velocities.  Blood pressure goals
were then decreased from 140 to 160, and his ventriculostomy
drain was raised to 20 mm above the tragus.  On [**2114-7-17**] an
attempt was made to wean his ventriculostomy drain.  It was
clamped.  On [**2114-7-18**] he had a head CT to assess the
ventricular size since his ventriculostomy catheter was
unclamped, which showed previous areas of subarachnoid
hemorrhage seen along the sulci adjacent to the anterior falx
had  resolved.  There were no masses identified.  The
ventricles and subarachnoid spaces were within normal limits.
On [**2114-7-19**] his drain remained clamped.  He also underwent a
diagnostic cerebral angiogram which showed stable appearance
of the previously treated anterior communicating artery
ruptured aneurysm with presence of mild to moderate vasospasm
in the right internal carotid artery and right anterior
cerebral artery and diffuse mild vasospasm in the posterior
circulation and left internal carotid artery.  His drain was
reopened due to complaints of headache on [**2114-7-19**].  His
drain was opened at 20 and eventually raised up to 25.  The
drain was clamped on [**2114-7-22**].  He continued to be on HHH
therapy with a goal blood pressure of 150 to 170 and CVP in
the 8 to 10 range.  So far during his hospitalization, he had
no infectious disease issues or any other laboratory value
issues.  On [**2114-7-23**], he had a repeat head CT which showed
nondilated ventricles while his ventriculostomy catheter
again had been clamped at this point.  TCDs were performed on
[**2114-7-23**] which showed velocities very elevated bilaterally.
Right MCA was greater than 180, left MCA 160, right ACA
approximately 140, and left ACA 120.  On [**2114-7-24**], the
ventriculostomy drain was discontinued, and a repeat head CT
was done on [**2114-7-25**] which showed a resolved small residual
intraventricular hemorrhage.  No acute intracranial findings
status post drain removal.  No hydrocephalus.  On [**2114-7-25**]
and [**2114-7-26**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained of headaches sometimes
severe at times.  He remained neurologically intact and a LP
was done to assess for ICP, and the ICP opening pressure was
24.  On [**2114-7-27**] a second LP was done which showed an opening
pressure of 34, and it was noted that his CSF at that time
was cloudy; closing pressure was 7.  Infectious Disease was
consulted immediately due to the CSF cloudiness, and they had
recommended empiric coverage of possible meningitis with
vancomycin and ceftazidime, and they recommended vancomycin
IV every 8 hours.  On [**2114-7-28**] they noted Mr. [**Known lastname **] had begun
having fevers up to 102.7 max.  He was cultured.  All his
cultures came back negative, but given his high fever and
some meningeal signs that he was showing specifically, nuchal
rigidity, Infectious Disease recommended empiric antibiotics
with vancomycin 1 gm every 8 hours and Ceptaz 2 gm every 8
hours for 2 weeks.  On [**2114-7-28**], a lumbar puncture showed an
opening pressure of 19.  On [**2114-7-29**], Dilantin and nimodipine
were discontinued.  His HHH therapy was further stopped.  He
remained awake, alert, and oriented, neurologically intact.
His last CSF showed 4 plus polymorphonucleocytes, no
organisms.  On [**2114-7-29**], an LP was performed which showed an
opening pressure of 12.  At this point, his fevers max were
102.8 degrees for the [**2114-7-28**].  On [**2114-7-29**] and [**2114-7-30**],
his fevers had defervesced and the T-max was now 98.4
degrees, remained neurologically intact.  On [**2114-7-30**] an LP
was performed which showed an opening pressure of 17.
Infectious Disease recommended every other day lumbar
punctures.  He was transferred to the surgical floor.
Physical therapy saw him and felt he was safe to be
discharged home.  On [**2114-8-2**] an LP was done that showed an
opening pressure of 19.  Given the continued high opening
pressures, it was felt that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would benefit from a
lumbar drain, and  lumbar drain was placed under sterile
procedures without any difficulties and to a furthe
