Brief Hospital Course:
 The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2170-7-30**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 5 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].   Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 3 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged home with VNA in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
