Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status/hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation for respiratory distress.
2. Right internal jugular central venous catheter placement and
removal.


History of Present Illness:
64 yo male with a PMH significant for morbid obesity, DMII,
GERD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and prior ventilatory dependency
(felt to be multifactorial in the setting of obesity, OSA, and
?COPD) s/p trach removal [**2110-3-31**] for plugged trach, who presented
from NH with increased somnolence [**4-24**]. Per ED report, he had
been confused with hallucinations over the past 3-4 days with
lethargy and SOB. He was treated with Bactrim [**Date range (1) 70151**],
Levofloxacin 750 mg, daily [**Date range (1) 23778**], and Imipenem 500 mg IV q
6hr [**Date range (1) 17857**] for a UTI. He had no f/c/s, no cough, no focal
neuro change. He was arousable only with pain and movement.
.
In the ED, his vitals were:. Tm 99 HR 81-95 BP 69-148/61-81 RR
16-20 Sat 93% 2LNC. Initial ABG was: 7.37/65/65. Lactate was
0.8. He did not respond to a dose of narcan. Later ABG was
7.25/74/42 and pt was noted to have increased somnolence. Serum
and urine tox screens were negative. CXR was unchanged with a L
hemidiaphragmatic elevation (not new). Tpn was 0.20, which is
baseline. EKG revealed old LBBB. UA appeared dirty, so pt was
treated with Vanc and CTX.

ICU Course:
After fiberoptic intubation for hypercarbic respiratory failure,
SBP dropped to the 60s, so propofol gtt was stopped. He remained
hypotensive so CVL was placed and 5 L NS were administered. He
was also started on dopamine gtt-->levophed gtt, which was
quickly tapered off, and he was able to be extubated [**4-24**].

Past Medical History:
-Respiratory Failure on mechanical ventilator with tracheostomy
since [**2-1**]. Chronic failure was felt to be multifactorial and
related to COPD, OSA, and obestiy. Complicated by subglottic
stenosis requiring rigid bronchoscopy with ablation of
granulation tissue [**2110-3-12**]; Pt had clogged tracheostomy tube
[**2110-3-31**] with patent airways above and below so tube was removed
-DM
-Hypercholesterolemia
-h/o afib in the past while in ICU--pt declined anticoagulation
but did require amiodarone
-Depression
-GERD
-Morbid Obesity
-Neuropathy
-H/o CHF
-h/o hyponatremia
-H/O cva IN [**1-/2109**] with residual R sided weakness
-DM

2. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo male with a PMH significant for morbid obesity, DMII,
GERD, HTN, yperlipidemia, and prior ventilatory dependency (felt
to be multifactorial in the setting of obesity, OSA, and ?COPD)
s/p trach removal [**2110-3-31**] for plugged trach, presents with
hypotension and hypercarbic respiratory failure, now resolved
and extubated.
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Quickly weaned from [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
have been caused by infection, ie UTI, with poor pulmonary
reserve, or mucus plugging, given quick recovery. Now extubated
and sats in mid 90s on room air. Continue with alb/atro, chest
PT, to prevent future mucus plugging.
.
# Genital abnormality: divided ventral surface of penis,
congenital hypospadias vs possibly secondary to chronic
indwelling foley catheter, appears chronic with well-healed skin
and no signs of infection. Recommend outpatient follow-up with
urology if patient desires reconstructive surgery.
.
# Acute renal failure: Pts BL Cr is 0.9 to 1.1, with Cr peak
1.6, now 1.0. Peripheral diff shows 10% eos, down from 12,
likely resolving AIN. Recent new medications have included
bactrim, imipenem, and levofloxacin. Possible causes of AIN
include the bactrim and levofloxacin.
- received vanc and cefepime for UA with mod leuk est, neg nitr,
+ WBCs, but culture negative, so will D/C abx
.
# Eosinophilia: Suspect AIN given ARF.
--trend diff now that off abx and Cr normalized
.
# Diastolic dysfunction: From TTE in [**12-2**], the pt had a nl EF
with hyperdynamic function. Restart lasix on discharge.
.
# HTN: Restarted lisinopril 20, metoprolol 75 tid, amlodipine
10mg since BP stable after extubation.
.
# CAD risk equivalent: on [**Date Range **], home statin
.
# DM: continue SSI and NPH; had been on NPH 35 [**Hospital1 **], reduced to
14 qam and 10 qpm with good control of FSBS. [**Month (only) 116**] need to
increase again if diet changes.
.
# Psych: Continue on Wellbutrin and Effexor; restarted remeron
[**4-29**] after it had been on hold for concern of contributing to
decreased MS.
.
# PPX: SC Heparin, colace, reglan, PPI
# FEN: Diabetic diet.
# Access: R IJ placed in ICU; D/C'd RIJ since has working
peripherals
