Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization x2 with thrombectomy and drug eluting
stent to the obtuse marginal artery


History of Present Illness:
71 yo male wiht h/o CABG in [**2186**], PTCA [**2192**], s/p stenting [**2197**]
(unknown anatomy, getting records from the [**Hospital1 756**]), smoking,
HTN, HLD, and diabetes who is presenting with chest discomfort.
The patient reports that the night prior to presentation, he
developed left sided chest pain; dullness without any radiation.
 No associated diaphoresis, but reports slight nausea and
shortness of breath.  The pain was persistent, and did not
respond to SL Nitro.  The pain also progressively worsened over
the course of the day, prompting the patient to call EMS.  EMS
gave to SL NG sprays, with no relief.
.
The patient does not remember if this chest pain is similar to
pain he had in the past prior to his past cardiac events.
Denies any worsening exercise tolerance; the patient reports
being able to walk about one block before getting short of
breath.  Denies any orthopnea, denies PND.  Reports increasing
LE swelling; reports that he has never had swelling like this
before.  Of note, the patient's wife reports that he has been
chest pain free for about one year.
.
Denies any recent travel, no long plane rides.  Up to date with
his cancer screening, as per wife-last colonoscopy 2 years ago,
found polyps.  Is not very active at his baseline; does not like
walking, does not like going outside.
.
He had a stress test (due to chest pain) in [**Month (only) **], which showed
2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia at achieved
workload single vessel CAD-new regional dysfunction with distal
inferior hypokinesis. LVEF >55%
.
On ROS, the patient denies any recent fevers/chills, no blood in
stools, no changes in bowel movements, no urinary symptoms.
Denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.
.
In the ED, the patient's initial vitals: 97.8 64 138/79 16 95%
RA.  He was initially given 1 L of fluid and treated for COPD
excacerbation with azithromycin, prednisone, and nebulizers.  He
then developed respiratory distress and required NRB.  Repeat
CXR showed ? worsening pulmonary edema and patient was given 20
mg IV lasix.  EKG unchanged from priors, found to have elevated
troponin and started on IV heparin, given ASA.  Received 8 mg
morphine, 1 mg Dilaudid and now chest pain free.

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2199-11-6**]):    No MRSA isolated.
.
IMAGING/STUDIES:
.
TTE [**11-3**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall

normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Trace aortic regurgitation.
.
CXR PA/LAT [**11-3**]:
IMPRESSION: Emphysema with superimposed pulmonary edema. Trace
bilateral
pleural effusions.
.
C.CATH [**11-4**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Thrombus in the vein graft to OM.
3. Small hematoma at arterial puncture site.
.
C.CATH [**11-6**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Success PCI to the 95% SVG to OM lesion with Promus DES.
2. Patient to remain on aspirin indefinitely and clopidogrel for
at
least 1 year uninterrupted.
3. No complications.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo male with h/o CABG in [**2186**], PTCA [**2192**], s/p stenting [**2197**],
smoking, HTN, HLD, and diabetes who is presented with chest pain
and was found to have NSTEMI and acute diastolic CHF
exacerbation.
.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
.
# NSTEMI: Mr. [**Known lastname 71328**] was admitted to the CCU with a chief
complaint of chest pain without ST elevations on EKG and a
significant coronary history including CABG followed by PTCA and
stenting. Cardiac catheterization showed proximal occlusion of
SVG to OM and thrombus. On initial catheterization, no
intervention was attmepted because the interventional team was
not able to protect distal to thrombus for emboli. However,
repeat catheterization was successful with deployment of DES to
the 95% occluded SVG to OM lesion. The patient was started on
aspirin 325mg daily and will need to continue taking this
indefinitely, as well as plavix which he will need for at least
1
