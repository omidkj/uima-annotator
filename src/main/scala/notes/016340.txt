CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post syncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction seven years ago, status post three
vessel coronary artery bypass graft seven years ago with
saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one who has
been asymptomatic since who was in his usual state of health
this evening when he developed lightheadedness followed by
syncope and loss of bowel control while sitting in a chair
watching TV.  His wife called EMS.  He was found to have a
heart rate in the 20s to 30s with a systolic in the 100s to
110s.  The patient was given Atropine without effect.
Systolic pressures dropped into the 70s and the patient was
transcutaneously paced on route to the hospital.  At the
outside hospital the patient's potassium was found to be 8.0
and a creatinine of 2.5.  He was treated aggressively with 1
amp of D50, 10 units of regular insulin, 1 amp of calcium
chloride.  He was also given Digibind 5 vials for a Digoxin
level of 1.0.  He was given Kayexalate and a temporary
transvenous pacer was placed and the patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**].

The patient denies any history of chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations prior to this syncope.  Currently he is
again without any chest pain or lightheadedness.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He admits to increasing pruritus over his
entire body for the past two to three weeks.  He also notes
decreased urine stream and decreased urine output over the
last few days.  He also notes decreased appetite and
decreased po intake over the past few days.  He denies any
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity
edema.  Also of note he has been taking Aldactone for the
last two months along with potassium supplements and eating
bananas with breakfast.  He has also been taking indomethacin
for the last week for a gouty attach of his right big toe.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction/three vessel coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2173**].  2.  Gout.  3. Chronic renal
insufficiency per wife.  4.  Cataracts status post surgery of
the left cataract.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3.  Blood pressure

movements intact.  No scleral icterus.  Dry mucous membranes.
Oropharynx clear.  Neck supple.  He has a right IJ [**Last Name (un) 14097**] in
place with a temporary pacer wire.  Lungs, there is scattered
crackles at the bases right greater then left.  Heart
examination.  Regular rate.  S1 and S2.  No murmur noted.
Abdomen soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities, there is trace lower extremity edema
bilaterally.  Skin examination the patient has warm, dry skin
with a slightly raised pink macular papular rash over his
abdomen and some linear petechia on his lower extremities
bilaterally.  Genitourinary, the patient with mild swelling
of the foreskin at the ureteral meatus.  No evidence of
balanitis.  No erythema or discharge.

LABORATORIES AT THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White blood cell count
13.6, hematocrit 35.6, platelets 371, potassium 8.0, BUN 53,
creatinine 2.8, glucose 201.  On arrival at the [**Hospital1 346**] the patient's white count 9.2, 72%
polys, 15% lymphocytes, hematocrit 31.7, platelets 301,
potassium 6.2, BUN 49, creatinine 2.6, coags normal.  First
CK 46, calcium 9.4, phos 5.0, magnesium 2.7, potassium 6.4.
Chest x-ray revealed pulmonary edema.  Pacer wire in
position.  Arterial blood gas 7.39, 33, 64 on 2 liters nasal
cannula.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Ischemia:  The patient with a history
of coronary artery disease status post three vessel coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2173**] given new onset of complete heart
block, although the patient had no electrocardiogram changes
consistent with ischemia.  The patient was ruled out with
three sets of negative enzymes.  The patient was continued on
aspirin.  He will need an outpatient stress test at some
point to determine if there is any new inducible ischemia
after his previous coronary artery bypass graft.

2.  Pump:  The patient is hypotensive on arrival.  He was on
Dopamine at the outside hospital, however, did not require
pressor support during this stay.  The patient was bolused
with normal saline, 250 cc during the first two days of
hospitalization with good improvement in his urine and his
blood pressure and urine output.  The patient was then
restarted on his Lopressor and eventually was restarted on
his Cozaar and Betapace as well.  Zestril was held.  The
patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout.  Repeat
echocardiogram revealed an EF of 20%, multiple regional wall
motion abnormalities.  No significant change since
echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 958**] at outside hospital.  The patient
continues Cozaar for afterload reduction.  Digoxin was
discontinued.

3.  EP:  The patient was admitted with complete heart block
secondary to hyperkalemia.  The patient's potassium and
creatinine corrected.  The patient regained his normal sinus
rhythm.  Temporary pacing wire was pulled after 48 hours and
the patient was restarted on his Betapace.  Again Digoxin was
held.  The patient did have one rune of twelve beats of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the setting of a low
magnesium.  The patient's magnesium was repleted and the
patient had no further ectopy.  Cardiologist was notified and
the patient may need EP study ICD in the near future.

4.  Renal:  The patient with acute renal failure.  Baseline
creatinine unknown, but per wife was abnormal.  On obtaining
further records the patient's creatinine was 1.2 in [**Month (only) 205**] and
then increased to 1.9 early this year.  The patient was
admitted with a creatinine of 2.8.  The patient was hydrated.
Renal toxic medications such as Indocin, Aldactone, Zestril
and Digoxin were held.  The patient's creatinine continued to
improve from 2.6 down to 2, eventually down to 1.4 and then
upon discharge the patient's creatinine was 1.0.  The patient
also had a renal ultrasound, which was negative for
obstruction, however, revealed a question of an echogenic
mass in the left upper pole.  The patient will need an MRI of
his kidney to further elucidate what this is, although likely
represents a duplication of the collecting system.  Given the
patient's anxiety and claustrophia he denied an MRI.  The
patient will need to follow up with his primary care
physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] primary care physician was notified prior to
discharge.  The patient's urinalysis and urine cultures were
negative.  Phena was less then .3 indicating a prerenal
picture again with cessation of renal toxin medications and
gentle fluids, the patient's creatinine improved to baseline
at 1.0.

5.  FEN:  Patient was admitted with a potassium of 8.0 likely
secondary to recently starting Aldactone, using Indocin for
gout and worsening renal function.  Also the patient was
supplementing with po potassium in the presence of an ace
inhibitor.  The patient's potassium, Zestril, Aldactone and
Indocin were held as the creatinine improved.  The patient's
potassium also improved.  The patient was given an additional
D50 and 10 units of insulin along with Kayexalate and 2 amps
of calcium chloride.  The patient's potassium was 6.4 in the
