Headache/Facial Pain

History of Present Illness:
This is a 48 year old male with a [**4-12**] history of R facial
pain and headache, as well as progressively worsening LUE/LLE
weakness. He was seen at his PCPs office for the pain on
Wednesday of last week, was diagnosed with sinusitis/bronchitis,
and was placed on PCN 500 TID. Has developed progressive L-sided
weakness since then, to the point where he is now unable to use
his L arm, or walk without holding on to something. He fell at
home this morning, and was sent by ambulance to [**Hospital6 50929**]. A head CT was performed, which demonstrated a large, R
posterior parietal/occipital mass with significant vasogenic
edema, sulci effacement, and 6mm of midline shift. He was given
10mg of Decadron, Dilantin load, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
continued care. A chest XR was also concerning for a R lung lobe
opacification/possible underlying nodule.

He continues to complain of significant facial pain and
headache,
as well as LUE and LLE weakness.  He is also significantly
dizzy.
He denies visual changes, Nausea, vomiting, or R-sided weakness.

Pertinent Results:
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2114-1-28**]
Large ring-enhancing lesion identified at the right parietal and

occipital region, more likely consistent with the large abscess
formation with irregular enhancement capsule, the remote
possibility of a neoplasm cannot be completely ruled out.
Significant mass effect and effacement of the sulci with
anterior displacement of the right ventricular atrium is
identified, there is also shifting of the normally midline
structures towards the left with approximately 6.1 mm of
deviation. No frank evidence of uncal herniation is identified,
however, there is mild effacement of the perimesencephalic
cisterns on the right. A small focus of high signal intensity is
noted on the FLAIR at the left frontal subcortical white matter,
possibly reflecting a gliotic foci. No other areas with abnormal
enhancement are identified. Inspissated secretions are noted at
the right maxillary sinus with restricted diffusion, raising the
possibility of sinusitis, there is also mucosal thickening at
the left maxillary sinus.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2114-1-29**]
1. Post-surgical changes with decreased leftward shift now
measuring 2 mm.  Persistent hypodensity in the right parietal
lobe with surrounding edema and pneumocephalus is identified.
Small punctate hyperdensity consistent with hemorrhagic foci is
consistent with post-surgical changes.
2. Sinus disease.

MRI brain [**2114-2-1**]:
 In comparison with the post-surgical head CT dated [**1-29**],

[**2113**], there is evidence of increase fluid with new ring
enhancement in the
area of the previously drained right parietal abscess,
concerning for abscess reaccumulation. Increasing mass effect
and worsening midline shifting towards the left as described
above. Apparently, there is new satellite lesion identified in
the medial aspect of the right occipital lobe measuring
approximately 9.8 x 5 mm in size. Stable post-surgical changes
noted on the right parietal convexity.

CT head [**2114-2-1**]
No evidence of postoperative intracranial hemorrhage or new
collection. Persistent vasogenic edema within the right parietal
lobe with
interval decrease of mass effect and left shift.



Brief Hospital Course:
48 y/o male presented with a 5 day history of facial pain and L
sided weakness. He was seen by his PCP for his facial pain and
treated with PCN for sinusitis. He then began to develop L sided
weakness which lead him to fall. He went to an OSH where a head
CT showed a large R posterior parietal /occipital mass with
significant edema. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and admitted
to the ICU. Patient was taken to the OR emergently on [**1-28**] for
suboccipital burr holes for evacuation of abscess. He remained
intubated post operatively. In the post operative period,
patient presented with L sided weakness that over the night and
into [**1-29**] has improved to a [**3-12**]. Exam on [**1-30**] off propofol
follows commands, moves all extremities, L [**3-12**] and full strength
with R side. Corrected dilantin level was 7.3.

ENT and dental were consulted to determine cause of infection.
ENT does not believe that his sinuses are the cause of his
abscess and dental will re-examine the patient when extubated
and able to have a better exam. The patient has multiple dental
carries and loose teeth. Infectious disease recommends
vanc/ancef/flagyl.

On the morning of [**2-1**], the patient was found to be markedly
weaker on the left upper and lower extremity, and he was
increasingly lethargic.  A stat head CT was performed, which
demonstrated significant increase in mass effect/edema in the R
hemisphere, and a possible re accumulation of his brain abscess.
 He was taken emergent to the OR for an evacuation of this
abscess.  Approximately 15cc of pus was drained.  He went back
to the SICU intubated, due to his PNA, thick bronchial
secretions, and his pre op Na of 124.

On [**2-2**] he was extubated and Mannitol was being weaned. His
3%NSS was stopped [**Male First Name (un) **] [**2-3**] and he was transferred to the step
down unit.  and then the floor on [**2114-2-5**]. His Left sided
weakness continued to gradually improve. Mannitol and Decadron
were tapered. He was being followed by infectious disease and
they made final recommendations for IV ceftriaxone and po Flagyl
for a minimum of 6 weeks.
He had teeth extraction with oral surgery on [**2114-2-8**], as this may
have been a cause for the abscess.  PICC line was placed on
[**2114-2-9**] and he was medically cleared for transfer to rehab.
