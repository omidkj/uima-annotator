History of Present Illness:
76 yo M w/ h/o paraplegia [**12-26**] T9 epidural abscess and
osteomyelitis, CAD s/p CABG, AV dissociation, h/o VT, pAF,
ischemic CMP (EF 35%), PVD, and COPD on 2L oxygen who presents
to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] rehab after VF arrest. He has previously
been seen by cardiology during his two most recent admissions in
[**Month (only) 205**] and [**Month (only) 216**] for episodes of AV dissociation. During his
initial hospitalization, cardiology recommended holding nodal
and QT prolonging agents; there was no indication for pacing at
that time as the block was transient and thought to be related
to extubation. During his second admission in [**Month (only) 216**], the EP
service again felt he was not a candidate for a pacer as he was
asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable, and on IV abx for
prolonged treatment of osteomyelitis, precluding placement of
any permanent pacer.

The day prior to presentation, patient was complaining of
dyspnea and was noted to have dropping sats in his rehab. He
subsequently per report had a witnessed VF arrest though there
are no EKGs or other records of the event. CPR was initiated w/o
delay and he was intubated on the scene in the setting of his
arrest. He received 4 rounds of shock w/ ROSC. At that time,
patient was responsive so he was not cooled. He was given xanax
and morphine and transported on AC 14 x 600, PEEP5, 50% FIO2. A
double lumen mid-line was placed prior to transporting him to
[**Hospital1 18**].

On arrival to the floor, patient T97.6 HR 62 BP 127/46 RR 25 O2
sat 92% on the vent settings above. He quickly deteriorated
dropping his HR's to the 30s, initially keeping his pressures in
the 100s, but then subsequently dropped his pressures 60/40s. He
was bolused one liter and then started on levophed. Cardiology
was contact[**Name (NI) **] and a transvenous pacemaker was placed emergently
in the MICU. The patient is now being transferred to the CCU for
further management.

STUDIES:
([**8-9**]) ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with mid to distal septal and anterior akinesis and hypokinesis
of all other walls apart from the basal septum and basal
inferolateral segments. The apex is dyskinetic. A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Severe focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
multi-vessel ischemia. There may be an apical thrombus -
suboptimal image quality precludes certainty about this finding.
No significant valvular abnormality.

([**8-9**]) CXR:  The ET tube is 6 cm above the carina.  There is an
NG tube, but the tip is not adequately visualized to assess for
appropriate position.  There is increased opacity at both bases,
which could be due to volume loss or early infiltrate.  Spinal
fixation device and sternal wires are visualized.

([**8-13**]) CXR: In comparison with study of [**8-10**], there is continued
evidence of vascular congestion with hazy opacification at the
bases consistent with bilateral pleural effusions and
compressive atelectasis at the bases.  The difference in
appearance may merely reflect the changes in patient position,
with the patient more supine on the current study.  Endotracheal
tube and nasogastric tube have been removed.  There is now a
left subclavian catheter that extends to the lower portion of
the SVC.  Single-channel pacemaker device remains in place.
Extensive spinal surgery is again evident.

EKG [**8-16**]:
Indeterminate atrial rhythm. Ventricular pacing intermittently
with occasional suppression by ventricular premature complexes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2155-8-15**] the ventricular
premature complexes are new.

CXR [**8-20**]:
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there has
been interval
removal of a right-sided pacing hardware, placement of a left
side generator with a single lead.  Interval decrease in pleural
effusions.  Moderate cardiomegaly that is unchanged.  No
evidence of pneumothorax.  The vertebral stabilization devices
are unchanged.  Pre-existing areas of atelectasis at the lung
bases have decreased.

CXR [**8-21**]: pending

Brief Hospital Course:
76M with a PMH significant for CAD (s/p CABG), ischemic CMP
(LVEF 35%), COPD (on home oxygen), history of ventricular
tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, and paraplegia [**12-26**] T9
epidural abscess and osteomyelitis presenting s/p VF arrest w/
evidence of AV-dissociation and prolonged QTc with hemodynamic
instability.
.
# AV-DISSOCIATION - Patient had complete heart block, and had a
transvenous pacer placed.  Patient has reported history of VT
and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a recent admission noted
asympatomatic bradycardia to the 30-40s. His EKG on admission
demonstrated AV-dissociation with a ventricular rate of 40, and
this has been at least intermittently occurring since 6/[**2154**].
