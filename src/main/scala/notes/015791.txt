Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 53M w/ ETOH cirrhosis, colon ca s/p colectomy on [**2108-12-18**]
(c/b post-op c-diff) admitted on [**1-10**] with abdominal pain,
initial tap revealed greater than 1000WBC in peritoneal fluid,
only growth from any of the peritoneal samples grew fluc
sensitive [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  Pt was briefly in the MICU for
hypotension and hypoxia.  He was initially on CVVH for acute
renal failure and completed a course of vancomycin for presumed
pneumonia and was transferred back to the floor for further
management.
On the floor:

#)Peritonitis.  Finished course of Cefepime on [**2-8**] for presumed
bacterial peritonitis (WBC of 1000) in post operative setting.
Fluconazole to continue until [**2-22**] (4week course) for fungal
peritonitis in post-op setting (fluconazole sensitive [**Female First Name (un) **]
albicans). Repeat tap 2 weeks into the course of treatment
showed clearance of bacterial and fungal infection and repeat
tap on the day of discharge remains negative for infection (100
WBC). Needs to continue Flagyl until one week after cefepime is
finished for c-diff prophylaxis (last day [**2109-2-15**]).
.
#)Acute renal failure - Presumed due to hepatorenal syndrome and
ATN. Seen by renal service and initially on CVVH and then
intermittent dialysis 1-2 times per week, with stable creatinine
no at 3 to 3.3. Pt's creatinine has plateaued on dialysis, with
approximate crcl of 25. UOP 350 to 450 cc per day. Will most
likely need intermittent HD, and follow up of renal function at
rehab center. Tunneled line placed on [**2109-2-12**] by IR today.
Continued to hold diuretics due to renal failure.
Will need to continue midodrine 15 mg TID, octreotide 200mcg TID
and daily albumin 25 gram per renal and hepatology for HRS. In
case renal function remains impaired and does not resolve, early
decision needs to be made with regard of indication for renal
co-transplantation.
.
#)C.diff - patient with documented severe C.diff infection at
[**Hospital1 2025**] postoperatively after colectomy. Will continue course of PO
Flagyl until [**2-15**] for prophylaxis as recommended by ID service.
C.diff stool toxin A and B, so far negative.
.
#)ETOH cirrhosis/ESLD - h/o ascites, pleural effusion,
esophageal varices; per patient not on lactulose at home, has
been receiving in house. No asterixis, but pt seems
intermittently confused, per wife he "waxes and wanes."
Continued bowel regiment with lactulose (sometimes refuses -it
has to be reinforced), continued rifaximin. Patient refuses
repeatedly his medication, reporting he is "off this medicine"
or "Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] I should not take it", however all his medications
have to be reinforced and compliant has to be supervised.
.
#)Cervical stenosis - s/p fall and cervical vertebral fracture
requiring surgical repair/stabilization with chronic neuropathic
pain. Low dose Dilaudid given liver and renal failure.
.
#)Depression - continued sertraline
.
#)Pain: prefer Dilaudid to morphine given impaired renal
function
.
#)FEN
low sodium, high caloric intake, calorie count suboptimal but
improves with encouragement.
.
#)Prophylaxis - pantoprazole, pneumoboots (no heparin for HIT),
bowel regimen
.
#)Code status: full
.
#) Dispo - screen for rehab, PT/OT.
