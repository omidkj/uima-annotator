History of Present Illness:
89 yo F w/ dementia, recently diagnosed DVT on warfarin, who
presents from [**Location (un) 583**] House with altered mental status and
hypotension. Pt was recently admitted here from [**Date range (1) 18881**] with
altered mental status and was found to have UTI (cefpodoxime
until [**11-23**]) and DVT in the left common femoral and proximal
superficial femoral veins(started on warfarin on [**11-18**], bridged
with lovenox).

She was also admitted from [**Date range (1) **] with lethargy and failure
to thrive, where she was thought to have acute on chronic
diastolic heart failure (discharged on her home 60mg po daily
lasix). Failure to thrive was thought to be subacute in nature
and per her most recent dc summary, pt has had steady decline
over the past year where now she is no longer able to feed
herself.

Per records, she was on coumadin and had her last dose of
lovenox 70mg subq at 8AM on [**11-21**]. Pt had T 100.2 at the nursing
home. In the ED, initial VS were: 96.4 60 100/30 28 99% 2L. Her
INR was 12.8 and she was subsequently given 10mg IV vitamin K.
Pt was also given Ciprofloxacin 400mg IV, Vancomycin 1gm IV, and
Metronidazole 500mg IV as she was hypotensive and was unclear if
there was infection. Of note, her WBC is 11.5, up from 6.4 on
[**2155-11-19**] her HCT was 25.3, down from 34.3 on [**2155-11-19**]. She was
given 2 units FFP and 1 unit pRBC. Gave 1.5L NS and per report
had loose, guaiac negative stool. FAST exam showed no
intraperitoneal bleed and prelim CT torso showed no hematoma. VS
upon transfer 99.2 55 101/24 16 98%, and BP upon manual recheck
118/30.

On arrival to the MICU, pt is in no acute distress, resting
comfortably in bed. She is accompanied by her daughter. Sounds
like over the past two days she has been back at [**Location (un) 583**] house,
she hasn't been having fevers, cough, pain or any new symptoms,
though the daughter does note that she was receiving tylenol
yesterday at the nursing home, though was unsure why. The
daughter also mentioned the pt's propensity to aspirate often
and reported she was on a special diet at [**Location (un) 583**], which is
documented as 2gm sodium, pureed nectar, prethickened liquids,
fluid restriction 2L.
