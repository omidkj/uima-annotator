Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: Fever
Reason for MICU admission: Line sepsis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R femoral line insertion
Hemodialysis
Removal of left portacath
Placement of right PICC

History of Present Illness:
This [**Age over 90 **] year old genleman with hx of ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG,
CHF, HTN, A-fib, ventricular brady-paced, RCC s/p L nephrectomy
presented to ED after dialysis as he experienced fever to 103,
rigors approximately 30 minutes into start of dialysis.
Of note, he is s/p new AV fistula placement on LUE with
temporary right fem line and placement of L permacath at recent
hospitalization ([**2139-7-26**]). Today he reports he hasn't felt quite
right since last hospitalization but today finally felt "back to
his usual self". Denies any history of nausea, vomiting, or
diarrhea since his last hospitalization.
Patient initally afebrile with systolic blood pressure initially
in 130 range, other VS stable. Through the course of his stay
his blood pressure trended downward to the 90's range (which
reportedly is his baseline) One hour later the patient's blood
pressure fell to 76/44, HR 70s, RR 20, 97% RA. Laboratories
revealed WBC 7.6 with bandemia of 8 and a lactate of 3.8.
Received fluid bolus with brief rise to systolic blood pressure
to 80's range. Pt began to act more confused and SBP to 70's.
Dopamine started. Given concern for line sepsis, perm-a-cath was
removed by transplant surgery team. R femoral line placed. SBP
returned to 100-110 range. Pt transferred to MICU.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include inferolateral
akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-2-11**],
estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher and left
ventricular systolic function is similar (prior ejection
fraction may have been underestimated).


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
# Coag neg staph sepsis: The patient had [**1-3**] blood cultures
positive with coag neg staph sepsis.  He was treated with
vancomycin and gentamicin starting on [**2139-8-12**].  Initially the
patient was hypotensive and required dopamine/levo for blood
pressure support briefly.  His recently placed left port-a-cah
was removed given evidence that suggested that the sepsis was
likely [**1-1**] the line.  He remained afebrile thereafter and his
blood pressure improved.  We monitored survelliance cultures and
continued with vancomycin (stopped the gentamicin).  We would
like him to complete a two week course of antibiotics.  We had
been dosing by level (goal >15) and were giving the vancomycin
with hemodialysis.
.
# ESRD on HD: There was a concern that the patient had some
swelling of his LUE fistula.  This was seen by the transplant
surgery team and an ultrasound was negative for any fluid
collection.  His graft was mature and usable for hemodialysis.
The patient continued on his routine schedule of HD once his
blood pressure had stabilized.  He has HD on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays.
.
# CAD: The patient has a known history of coronary disease.  He
had a brief episode of chest pain, shortness of breath, and
troponin elevation on [**8-14**].  His CKMB did not rise and his EKG
was difficult to interpret due to a paced rhythm.  The pain
lasted 30 seconds and was pleuritic in nature.  He was seen by
the cardiologists who initially recommended medical management
with isosorbide mononitrate, statin, aspirin, and the beta
blocker.  They did not request further intervention at that
time.  We subsequently obtained an echocardiogram which showed
inferolateral akinesis.  When compared to the previous echo done
on [**2139-6-9**], the degree of inferior akinesis was unchanged.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's coumadin was held initially
since he had the port-a-cath removed and also had a femoral line
placed briefly.  However, in the setting of his chest pain, the
patient was started on a heparin drip.  We started coumadin at
3mg qhs and bridged the patient with heparin to obtain an INR of
[**1-2**].  He will leave the hospital on hep gtt until he becomes
therapeutic.
.
# CHF: The patient had his AceI, digoxin, and BB held on
admission.  The beta blocker was restarted and the patient also
was started on isosorbide mononitrate.  His fluid was regulated
also by hemodialysis.
.
# Anemia: It was stable throughout his hospitalization.  We
