[**2159-6-1**]:  EKG:

Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. Occasional ventricular
premature
beats. Prolonged P-R interval. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2156-8-23**] no clear change.

[**2159-6-1**]:  chest x-ray:

 IMPRESSION:

Limited exam.  Multiple displaced right-sided rib fractures with
adjacent
subcutaneous emphysema.  Comminuted right scapular fracture.
Atelectasis
versus contusions in the right lung base.

[**2159-6-1**]:  cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:

 IMPRESSION:

1.  Small right pneumothorax without evidence of tension.  Right
upper lobe and right lower lobe pulmonary contusions.

2.  Comminuted right scapular fracture with right subscapular
hematoma.  No evidence of active extravasation.

3.  Flail chest with right 6th-8th rib segmental fractures.
Multiple
additional minimally displaced rib fractures as detailed above,
with small associated extrapleural hematomas.  Extensive right
posterolateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.  Minimally
displaced right proximal clavicle fracture.

4.  Multiple right thoracic vertebrae transverse process
fractures, as
detailed above.

5.  Esophagus is fluid-filled and may predispose the patient to
aspiration.

6.  Intact infrarenal aortobiiliac stent-graft without evidence
of endoleak.
Excluded aneurysm sac measures 5.9 x 5.4 cm.

[**2159-6-1**]:  cat scan of the c-spine:

 IMPRESSION:

1.  No cervical spine fracture, acute alignment abnormality, or
prevertebral soft tissue abnormality.

2.  Fractures of right T2 transverse process, right 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd
posterolateral ribs, right proximal clavicle, and right scapula.
 Numerous other transverse process and rib fractures are not
imaged, seen on accompanying CT torso.

3.  Irregular sclerosis in right aspect of C2 vertebral body.
Clinical
correlation with history of malignancy should be made and a bone
scan can be obtained for further evaluation.

[**2159-6-1**]:  cat scan of the head:

 IMPRESSION:
1.  No intracranial hemorrhage or calvarial fracture.
2.  Probable subacute to chronic infarct within the right
frontal lobe, with chronic infarcts in the left cerebellum and
right subinsular region as well.
If there is concern for an acute stroke, MR may be obtained for
further
evaluation

[**2159-6-1**]:  right shoulder x-ray:

Comminuted fracture of the right scapula and displaced fracture
of the right proximal clavicle.  Known right-sided rib fractures
are better seen on the previous CT.  No dislocation.

[**2159-6-4**]:  Echo:

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated mitral valve
bioprosthesis with high normal gradient and mild mitral
regurgitation. Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild aortic valve stenosis.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-10-16**],
the severity of aortic stenosis has increased. The mitral valve
gradient, severity of mitral regurgitation, and the egional and
global left ventricular systolic function are similar.

[**2159-6-4**]:  EKG:

 Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature contractions. Variable
A-V conduction, possible dual A-V nodal pathways. Compared to
the previous tracing of variable A-V nodal conduction is seen.
The other findings are
similar.

[**2159-6-5**]:  EKG:

Sinus rhythm with atrial ectopy. Left axis deviation.
Non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-6-4**] atrial
ectopy is new.

[**2159-6-6**]:  x-ray of abdomen:

IMPRESSION:  Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no obvious signs
of ileus or obstruction

[**2159-6-8**]:  chest x-ray:


Current study demonstrates that the patient has been extubated.
Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  No pneumothorax is seen
on the current
examination.  Bibasal atelectasis and bilateral pleural
effusions appear to be slightly improved as compared to the
prior study.

[**2159-6-10**]:  chest x-ray:

Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is interval
improvement in
pulmonary edema with also improvement of bibasa
