EGD [**2156-6-12**]
Esophagus:
 Mucosa: A streak of erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was
noted in the gastroesophageal junction. These findings are
compatible with mild esophagitis.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum:
 Excavated Lesions Multiple acute cratered ulcers were found in
the duodenal bulb ranging from 5 mm to 2.5 cm. The largest ulcer
had a pigmented spot vs. visible vessel that was actively oozing
fresh blood. A second smaller ulcer also had a pigmented spot
that was activley oozing fresh blood. Both ulcers were first
injected with 10-20 cc's of diluted epinephrine prior to
cautery.  [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was then applied for hemostasis
successfully. Both ulcers were washed extensively after
injection and cautery without evidence of further oozing.

Brief Hospital Course:
Below is a hospital course by systems. The patient went first to
the SICU and came out to the general floor for 48 hours prior to
d/c. The patient was taken off anticoagulation secondary to the
UGI bleed, but remained on GI prophylaxis and boots for DVT
prophylaxis throughout. The patients bleeding stopped and fluid
status and electrolytes were normalized through the hospital
course. Podiatry was consulted secondary to his chronic LE
diabetic ulcers. Urology was consulted for a difficult foley
placement secondary to penile swelling from the fluid
resuscitation. Chronic pain was consulted to maximize his PO
pain regimen.

NEURO: While in the ICU, the patient experienced delerium, which
promply resolved after minimizing sedation/anxiolytics,
reformatting his pain regimen to minimize narcotics, as well as
moving out to the floor. He is A/O x 4 upon d/c,

CV: Pt remained in a-fib with some runs of trigeminy and PVC's,
which has been a chronic and unchanged arrhythmia. His
anticoaglation was held secondary to the GI bleed and should be
restarted 1 month after d/c. He continues on lopressor and
amiodarone for rate control. The patients fluid status was
normalized as described below.

PULM: During ICU care, the pt. had minimal O2 requirements w/ 2
L NC, and is off O2 and sats of 100% on RA. CXR was NEG and no
other issues.

GI: The patient received endoscopy on the day of admission that
found esophagitis,
and 2 bleeding duodenal ulcers. Hemostasis was established with
epi injection and electrocautery. The patient was transitioned
from NPO to a regular heart healthy, diabetic diet throughout
the hospital stay.

HEME/ID: The pt. received a total of 11 U PRBCs b/w the
transferring hospital (10 U) and [**Hospital1 18**] (1U). He remained stable
w/ Hct of 26 after tx. Throughout the stay the pt. was afebrile
w/ WBCs highest at 12 and stable at 8 upon d/c.

GU/Renal: The patient was edematous and fluid overloaded upon
admission secondary to fluid and blood resuscitation. This was
subsequently diuressed over the hospital stay to a euvolemic
state. electrolytes were repleted appropriately. The pt.
experienced some incontinence secondary to bladder spasm, and
urology was c/s to place a foley because it was difficult with
the penile edema from the fluid resusc. His foley was d/c'd
today and a voiding trial is pending. Pt. is dtv b/w [**4-5**] and
will be at [**Hospital1 1501**], if no void foley must be replaced.

Ext: Podiatry has seen the patient for chronic ulcers on LE 2nd
DM. He had +Cx pseudomonas, and was started on [**Hospital1 **] acetic acid
dressing changes. He is not currently prescribed ABx per
podiatry, but the organism is resistant to quinalones, and if
the wound becomes purulent, another [**Doctor Last Name 360**] should be chosen to
Tx. No surgical intervention was necessary, and no osteomyelitis
was seen on XR. He should arrange close f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] in
[**Location (un) 1110**]. he continues on his pain Rx for neuropathic pain. He
should receive PT/OT at the [**Hospital1 1501**].
