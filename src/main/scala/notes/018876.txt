Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
This is a 46 year old female with a past medical history of
pancreatitis and alcoholic liver disease who presented to [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital on [**2115-2-18**] with a complaint of abdominal pain. The
patient reports that her pain had gradually been getting worse
over the three weeks prior to her presentation. It is described
as a diffuse ache, worse on the right side of the abdomen. No
change with eating, no associated sxs.

At the time of her admission, the pt was found to have acute
hepatitis and was thought to be mildly encephalopathic. Her ALT
was 25, AST 189, AP 233 and ammonia 134. Her INR was 2.0 and
remained roughly stable throughout her stay. The leading
diagnostic consideration was alcoholic hepatitis; the patient
denied APAP consumption and there was little evidence to support
another etiology (though it is unclear whether she has had an
infectious work-up). She was treated with lactulose. She was
also found to have an elevated WBC count of 20; it does not
appear that she was febrile at that time. She was treated
intermittently with Levaquin and vancomycin for a suspected skin
infection on her back; her WBC count fell to 13.7 and her skin
improved.

The pt was also found to be in renal failure, with an initial
SCr of 3, which then rose. The renal service was consulted; ddx
was felt to include a pre-renal, ATN or HRS. The pt was treated
aggressively with fluids and followed over several days without
any significant improvement, making HRS appear more likely to
the physicians there. She was thus started on midodrine,
octerotide and albumin.

On the day before transfer, three days since last CBC, her WBC
was re-checked and found to have risen to 22.7. The patient was
also noted to have low-grade temps. A CXR and repeat urine cx
were performed. The CXR was read as showing bilateral pneumonia,
although the feeling of the transferring physician was that this
was inconsistent with the patient's clinical picture. Cefepime
was started.

Of note, the patient had undergone paracentesis twice in the OSH
ED prior to her presentation on this admission. Two weeks prior
to the outside admission she had a 6L para without albumin. By
report, her SCr was at her baseline, 0.6, as recently as
[**2115-2-1**].

On ROS, the patient admits she had noted her eyes were yellow
several weeks ago. She denies any fevers or chills. No nausea or
vomiting; some abd pain as outlined above. Minimal,
non-productive cough. No loose, dark or red stools. No urinary
sxs. No MSK or neuro complaints.

IMAGING STUDIES:

CXR [**2115-2-25**]: IMPRESSION: Bilateral diffuse reticular nodular
opacity consistent with pneumonia.

ABD U/S [**2115-2-26**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhotic liver, marked hepatomegaly, and severe portal
hypertension.
Bidirectional portal venous flow directed into the patent
umbilical vein.
2. Moderate ascites. Due to marked hepatomegaly, the presence of
an ostomy
in the right lower quadrant, and the distribution of peritoneal
fluid, a safe
spot for bedside paracentesis was not identified.
Ultrasound-guided
paracentesis can be performed.
3. Normal kidneys without hydronephrosis.
4. Small gallstones without acute cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This was a 45 year old female with known alcoholic liver disease
transferred from OSH and determined to have acute on chronic
alcoholic liver disease, as well as, hepatorenal syndrome and
pneumonia.

# Acute on chronic alcoholic hepatitis: Patient was not a
candidate for transplant given her last reported alcohol was in
[**12-24**]. She was treated with intravenous steroids up until she
developed respiratory distress and was made CMO by her family in
the ICU. Patient's acute hepatitis was further complicated by
her hepatorenal syndrome and likely pneumonia.

# Respiratory Distress: Patient was transferred from the liver
floor to the MICU when she was found to be in respiratory
distress. Prior to developing respiratory distress patient was
already severely encephalopathic. ABG demonstrated worsening
acute metabolic acidosis. Diuresis was attempted in given
suspicion for pulmonary edema without good effect. MICU team
discussed patient's poor prognosis with family who agreed it was
best to make her comfort measures only.

# Hepatorenal Syndrome: Acute renal failure consistent with HRS.
Patient was treated with albumin, mitodrine and octreotide.
Treatment was stopped when patient made CMO.

# Encephalopathy: Patient's encephalopathy worsened quickly from
time of admission to hospital day 2. Encephalopathy worsened by
the fact that she refused both oral and PR lactulose and would
not tolerate an NG tube.

# Pneumonia: Patient found to have a bilateral pneumonia. White
blood cell count 17.2 on admission.  She was treated with
Meropenem which was stopped when she was made CMO.

After being made CMO the patient was transferred to the liver
service. She remained on a morphine drip titrated to comfort.
The patient passed away on [**2115-3-3**] from respiratory failure as
an immediate cause of death and acute on chronic alcoholic
hepatitis as her primary cause of death. Patient's family was at
bedside when she passed.
