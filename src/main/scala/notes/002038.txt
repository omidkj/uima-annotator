Service:

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Positive stress test.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times four.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
man who was referred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] for cardiac catheterization secondary to a routine ETT
which revealed 2.5 to 3 mm downsloping ST segment changes in
V4 through V6.  There were also 1.5 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in
the inferior leads.  Stress thallium imaging revealed a
reversible defect in the basilar portion of the inferolateral
wall.  Ejection fraction approximately 55%.  The patient
denied any anginal symptoms, chest pain, lightheadedness,
claudication symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  BPH, status post TURP approximately 20 years ago.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
2.  Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d.
3.  Isosorbide 10 mg t.i.d.
4.  Beconase nasal spray q.d.
5.  Flovent inhaler two puffs q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient is
an elderly man in no acute distress.  Vital signs:
Temperature 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 49, blood
pressure 129/61, respirations 18, 99% on room air.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  EOMI.  PERRL, anicteric.  The
throat was clear.  Neck: Supple, midline, without masses or
lymphadenopathy.  No bruit or JVD.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Chest:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, without masses or organomegaly.
Extremities: Warm, noncyanotic, nonedematous times four.
Good distal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  CBC 6.6/13.7/40.2/205.
Chemistries 142/4.5/107/27/24/1.2.  INR 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient came in for outpatient cardiac
catheterization which revealed an ejection fraction of
approximately 50% and a right dominant coronary artery system
with a severe three vessel disease.  The patient was admitted
post catheterization because of left main lesion as well as
oozing from the groin site.

The patient was placed on a nitroglycerin drip to keep
systolic blood pressures in the 120-140 range.  The patient
was also maintained on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
He was preopped for a coronary artery bypass graft in the
standard fashion.

On [**2116-2-17**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room for
a coronary artery bypass graft times four.  The patient had
LIMA to mid LAD, saphenous vein graft to descending LAD,
descending RCA and OM.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well.

The patient was taken to the CSRU postoperatively for closer
monitoring.  The patient was extubated on postoperative day
number zero.  On postoperative day number two, the patient's
chest tubes were removed.  He was subsequently transferred to
the floor without event.

On postoperative day number three, the patient's pacer wires
were removed.  In the middle of the day of postoperative day
number three, the patient had an episode of atrial
fibrillation and was rate controlled using 20 mg of IV
Lopressor and 300 mg of IV Amiodarone.  The patient
maintained a heart rate between 100-110 with systolic blood
pressures 85 or greater.  The patient spontaneously converted
back to normal sinus rhythm after approximately three to four
hours of atrial fibrillation.

The patient otherwise continued to work with Physical
Therapy.  A hematocrit was found to be 22 and 25 on repeat.
The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells for
this.  This helped with his previous orthostatic symptoms of
dizziness as well as orthostatic hypotension.  The patient
was then cleared by Physical Therapy for discharge to home
and subsequently discharged to home on postoperative day
number six.

At that time, the patient was tolerating a regular diet, and
had adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications and not
having any anginal symptoms or orthostatic symptoms.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIET:  Cardiac.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
3.  Percocet 5/325 one to two q. four hours p.r.n.
4.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
5.  Flovent 110 micrograms inhaler two puffs b.i.d.
6.  Beconase nasal spray q.d.
7.  Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. times seven days.
8.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq q.d. times seven days.
9.  Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.
10. Amiodarone 400 mg q.d.
11. Ambien 5-10 mg q.h.s. p.r.n.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should follow-up with
Cardiology within one to two weeks.  Address the need for
continued diuresis as well as adjustment of cardiac
medications at that time.  The patient should follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in four weeks time.  Encourage continuing incentive
spirometry and ambulation.
