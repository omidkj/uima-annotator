[**2104-12-11**] Carotid U/S: No significant carotid artery stenosis
identified(less than 40% on the right, none on the left).
[**2104-12-16**] [**Month/Day/Year **]: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The left atrium is elongated. Mild spontaneous [**Month/Day/Year 113**] contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous [**Month/Day/Year 113**]
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). The
right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. The coronary sinus is dilated (diameter
>15mm). Injection of agitated saline into the left upper
extremity appeared in the right atrium through the superior vena
cava, ruling out a persistent left SVC. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely not as
good given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Left
ventricular dysnchrony is present. The right ventricular cavity
is dilated with mild hypokinesis of the basilar portion but
severe mid and apical free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The non-coronary cusp is immobilized.
There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.3
cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The prosthetic mitral
valve leaflets are thickened. Motion of the prosthetic mitral
valve leaflets is abnormal. The leaflets appear to be fused at
their bases. The gradients are higher than expected for this
type of prosthesis. There is severe valvular mitral stenosis
(area <1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
valve ring appears somewhat more mobile than expected but there
is no perivalvualr leak and no evidence of dehiscence. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid
regurgitation is at least mild to moderate. At times it may be
slightly worse and emanates from the center of the valve. There
is a large left pleural effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the operating room at the time of the
study.
POST BYPASS The patient is being AV placed. The patient is
receiving milrinone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine by
infusion. The right ventricle displays improved systolic
function with mild free wall hypokinesis. The left ventricle is
hyperdynamic with an ejection fraction near 75 to 80%. There is
a bioprosthesis in the mitral position. It appears well seated
with normal leaflet function. There is trace valvular mitral
regurgitation. No perivalvular regurgitation is seen. The
maximum gradient through the mitral valve is 12 mmHg with a mean
gradient of 5 mmHg at a cardiac output of about 5.7
liters/minute. The tricuspid regurgitation is significantly
improved and is now mild. The aortic valve is unchanged. The
thoracic aorta appears intact.

Final Report
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: Comparison is made to multiple
prior
radiographs, most recently [**12-15**] and [**2104-12-18**]. Lung
volumes
remain low without evidence of pneumothorax and with unchanged
positioning to left-sided pacemaker and right Port-A-Cath. Left
pleural effusion has
increased in the interval with expected probable adjacent
compression
atelectasis. Mild right basilar atelectasis is improved with
stable
eventration of the hemidiaphragms. Cardiac silhouette remains
enlarged with no other change to mediastinal and hilar contours.
The epicardial pacing leads as well as right central venous line
have been removed in the interval.
Degenerative changes involving the right humeral head are again
noted.
IMPRESSION:
Marked interval increase in size to moderate left pleural
effusion and small right pleural effusion.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
