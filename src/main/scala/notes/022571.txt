Service:

Briefly, this is an 81-year-old male who has had a prior
history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary
artery bypass graft in the past who is also known to have
severe aortic stenosis, moderate ventricular dysfunction,
congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease status
post right carotid endarterectomy, hypertension, atrial
fibrillation and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus who
presented with dyspnea on exertion.  He was found to have
severe aortic stenosis with a calculated area of 0.6 and a
gradient of 40.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2145-10-19**] where
a pericardial AVR was performed.  The patient was transferred
postoperatively to the CSRU where he recovered.  The patient
was transferred postoperatively and was slowly weaned from
his ventilator.  He did well with the wean and was able to be
extubated on the end of postoperative day #1.  The patient's
pressors were weaned and the blood pressure tolerated well.
The patient's permanent pacemaker was set at DDD at 80 and
tolerated well.  Foley was kept in place at that time.  On
the 19th, it was removed in the evening.  His chest tubes
were also removed at that time and his external pericardial
pacing wires pulled on the 19th after being transferred to
the floor.

Physical therapy was consulted to begin working with him to
improve his ambulation and his endurance.  They felt that he
was capable of moving around, however he was significantly
weak and needed a lot of guidance.  At that time, it was
decided that the patient would benefit most from
rehabilitation placement.  The patient did well in aggressive
pulmonary toilet and continued diuresis was continued.  The
patient was screened for rehabilitation on [**2145-10-22**] and is
awaiting rehabilitation placement at this time.
