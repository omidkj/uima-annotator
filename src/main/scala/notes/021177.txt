Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
63 y/o F with hx of severe COPD requiring multiple intubations
in recent months, IgA deficiency, CAD and HTN presents with
worsening dyspnea over the past 2 weeks. Denies change in her
infrequent cough, fever, chills. She does note that her sputum
may be slightly more green than usual. No chest pain, no pedal
edema. Her daughter said that she has not seemed confused, as
she sometimes gets when her COPD flares. Since her condition has
worsened, she no longer gets out of bed. If she stands up, she
is very dizzy and feels the room spinning. She denies falls.
Approximately one week ago, a taper of prednisone was stopped.
.
She does have chronic abdominal pain. It feels like "someone is
punching her in the stomach" constantly. This makes her somewhat
nausated and she has a very low appetite. Her pain now is [**5-7**],
and at it's worst it is [**9-6**]. She occassionally vomits. No
blood in her vomit or stool. She has had significant weight loss
over the past year from 125 lbs to 85 lbs. Her fentanyl patch
was replaced this morning.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.9, P 121, BP 182/120, R 32, O2
sat 96% on NRB. Patient was given several nebulizer treatments
but continued to be tachypneic. She was then placed on nasal
CPAP and felt better. She was still using accessory muscles. The
ED was unable to get an ABG.
.
On the floor, patient still complained of shortness of breath,
although feeling better than when she initally came in. She
denies chest pain, leg pain, swelling, dizziness.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI

tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations. Denied diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain, although has hx of constipation. No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.

Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the basal inferior wall and hypokinesis of the
mid-segment. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50
%). The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2205-5-27**], the severity of mitral regurgitation
and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are now
reduced.
.
CXR:
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The lungs are
essentially clear except for multiple rib fractures with healed
and non-healed fracture seen bilaterally. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. There is no evidence of failure or new
consolidation worrisome for infectious process.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o F with hx of severe COPD, IgA immunedeficiency and CAD
who presents with worsening dyspnea, consistent with a COPD
flare.
.
# Dyspnea/COPD Flare: Pt.'s dyspnea was most likely secondary to
COPD flare as she recently came off steroids. She was sent to
the MICU and stabilized on nasal canula with frequent nebulizer
treatments. She was also treated wtih IV solumedrol q8hrs for 4
days before being transitioned to PO Prednisone 60mg with 18 day
taper. She completed a 5 day course of Azithromycin, but was
afebrile without positive blood cultures or signs of infection
during her hospitalization. An ECHO was performed to rule out
worsening heart disease as the cause of her dypsnea that showed
improvement since a previous echo. By hospital day 4, she
returned to her home O2 requirement and was transferred to the
general medicine floor for the remainder of her sta
