Carotid Bruit -none

Pertinent Results:
[**2145-3-22**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA was a short vessel.  The LAD was totally
occluded with a clear channel (technically subtotally occluded)
from the ostium to the proximal edge of the previously placed
bare metal stent.  It fills beyond via (mostly) right to left
collaterals and some LCx-septal collaterals.  The  LCx was a
large vessel with mild proximal disease.  It gives rise to a
major bifurcating OM with critical disease at the ostium of the
first branch. The AV groove circ has moderate proximal disease
and gives rise to 4 small, diseased branches distally.  The RCA
was a small caliber vessel with mild ostial disease, ~40%, and
spasm upon initial catheter engagement.  Intracoronary
nitroglycerine was given with improvement. The distal RCA had a
70% focal lesion and gave rise to a long RPDA with serial mild
to moderate focal lesions. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics
revealed normotension.

[**2145-3-23**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA no stenosis. Left ICA no
stenosis.

[**2145-3-26**] Echo PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed(LVEF= 40 %). With regional wall m otion abnormalities
in the anterior and inferior septal walls at the base, mid and
apical regions. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. POST-BYPASS: Normal
RV systolic function. Overall LVEF 40%. There is some
improvement in the previously hypokinetic regions. Intact
thoracic aorta. Mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old pleasant
Spanish speaking female with known history of CAD (s/p BMS to
LAD [**2135**]), DM, HL, HTN with progressive chest pain and
palpitations. She presented for evaluation with cardiac
catheterization which revealed three vessel disease. She
underwent usual surgical work-up and received medical management
prior to surgery. On [**3-26**] she was brought to the operating room
where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3 by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition, titrated on phenylephrine and propofol drips. Later
that day she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically
intact and extubated. On post-op day one she was started on beta
blockers and diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Later this day
she was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per protocol. Physical
therapy assisted patient with strength and mobility. She
continued to make good progress while receiving minor
adjustments in her medical care. On post-op day 7 she was
discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate
medications and follow-up appointments.
