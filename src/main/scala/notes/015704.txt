Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Crescendo Chest Pain

Cardiac Catheterization
Subclavian Artery Stent Placement


History of Present Illness:
This is an 87M s/p CABG [**2177**] w/ CP that has been intermittent
for the last several weeks, however it is increasing in
frequency today.
In the past it has been increased by quick bouts of exertion
(anxiety, changs in position, going outside into the heat) but
not gradually increasing exercise at the gym, It is improved
with nitro, as is his heartburn. On [**2-13**] Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] sent him
for a stress MIBI which showed a newly decreased EF of 37% and
an Inferolateral partially reversible perfusion defect new since
'[**92**] but old from '[**91**]?. Dr [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] arranged for a consultation
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss possible Cath on monday, however when
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] called the patient told him he had been have CP all
day and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] sent him to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.0 66 137/88 16 99%, he initially
reported 1/10 chest pain. EKG was read as sinus at 73 with
hyperacute T's concerning for increase from prior. Trop was
negative. Heparin bolus and drip was started and he was given 1
SL NTG. He was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for planned cath. Patient take
full strength ASA at home.
.
Currently, he is CP free.

Past Medical History:

2. Peripheral vascular disease s/p right common femoral artery
to posterior tibial bypass graft with non-reverse saphenous vein
3. Angina which is stable.
4. Diabetes type 2. (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9671**] - [**Last Name (un) **])
5. Progressive hearing loss s/p cochliar implant done in [**3-28**].
6. Bilateral carotid disease has had status post CEAs in [**2183**]
and again in [**Month (only) 958**] and [**2188-2-23**].
7. Status post TURP.
8. Severe left renal artery stenosis s/p stenting of the left
renal artery. ([**2-/2190**]; Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

======================
EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Left ventricular hypertrophy
with
ST-T wave changes consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2194-4-23**] the findings are
similar.
==============
CXR:
IMPRESSION: Right base opacity may be due to atelectasis or
possible pleural effusion. Underlying consolidation cannot be
entirely excluded. Dedicated PA and lateral views would be
helpful for further evaluation if and when patient able. Again
seen fractured upper two most sternal wires.
==============
[**2-24**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild-moderate aortic
regurgitation Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2193-2-15**], the severity of aortic regurgitation,
mitral regurgitation and estimated PA systolic pressure are all
now higher. Regional left ventricular systolic function is now
normal with improved global systolic function.
.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2194**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
======================
[**2200-2-24**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated native three
vessel
coronary disease. The LMCA had a 30% stenosis. The LAD had 100%
mid-vessel stenosis. The LCX had a 90% proximal lesion and a 90%
lesion
in the OM branch. The RCA was occluded proximally.
2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated widely patent
LAD-LIMA.
3. Venous conduit angiography demonstrated a 90% focal stenosis
in the
jump segment between the OM and the diagonal branches.
4. Arterial angiography demonstrated 90% ostial subclavian
stenosis.
5. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic
systolic
arterial hypertension.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systemic arterial hypertension at the start of the
case.
3. Subclavian stenosis
========================
Femoral Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: No pseudoaneurysm. No AV fistula. No hematoma
identified in
either groin.
========================


Brief Hospital Course:
87M with h/o CABG in [**2177**] at [**Hospital1 112**], DM2, HTN, CKD, Hyperlipidemia
and recent stress-MIBI showing an area of reversible ischemia
who presents with crescendo chest pain concerning for unstable
angina.
.
1. Unstable angina: The patient had negative cardiac enzymes and
an EKG that did not show acute ischemic changes. The patient was
started on a heprain gtt, aspirin, but was not plavix loaded. He
was continued on his beta blocker, atorvastatin, and
nitroglycerin. The patient did not have any chest pain prior to
his cardaic catheterization. He underwent a cath on [**2-24**] with
findings of 30% LMCA, 100% mid-LAD, 90% prox-LCx, 90% OM, and
total occlusion RCA.
