CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mental status change.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
Russian speaking female with CAD, dementia, hypertension,
atrial fibrillation and history of hip fracture and open
reduction and internal fixation who presented with change in
mental status.  The night prior to admission the patient had
increasing shortness of breath with exertion resulting in
difficulty ambulating.  When visited by the VNA on the day of
admission, the patient was short of breath, sleepy and
unarousable.  She was transferred to the Emergency Room where
on arrival she received Narcan with little improvement and
was found to be in atrial fibrillation.  Neurology consult
was obtained and the exam was non focal but limited by
decreased consciousness.  MRI/MRA of the head was obtained
which showed moderate small vessel disease but no acute
infarct.  LP was attempted multiple times without success and
patient was admitted to MICU for close observation.  In the
MICU the patient's mental status had returned to baseline by
the time of transfer.  She received Aricept and Zyprexa and
was minimally responsive after that.  The morning after she
was found to be in congestive heart failure and diuresed.
Aricept and Zyprexa were held and the patient returned to
[**Location 213**] mental status.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient had a
normal mental status exam, alert and oriented times three,
appropriate behavior and mental status was thought to be at
baseline per her son.  She denied any complaints and stated
that her breathing was better since the Lasix.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post
CABG in [**2124**], hypertension, hip fracture status post open
reduction and internal fixation, dementia on Aricept, atrial
fibrillation, paroxysmal.

MEDICATIONS:  Zoloft 100 mg po q day, Aricept 10 mg po q day,
enteric coated Aspirin 325 mg po q day, Multivitamin one po q
day, Diltiazem 240 mg po q day, Pravachol 10 mg po q day,
Zyprexa, Ambien, Ativan.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco or alcohol use.
She lives with her husband.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of 96.7,
blood pressure 112/35, pulse 84, respiratory rate 16 and
oxygen saturation of 95% on one liter.  On general
examination the patient is alert and cooperative, in no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equally round and reactive
to light, extraocular movements intact and oropharynx was
clear.  Neck exam was significant for JVD to the earlobe.
Lung exam revealed bibasilar crackles.  Heart exam revealed
regular irregular rhythm with 2-3/6 systolic murmur at the
left upper sternal border.  Abdominal exam was soft,
nontender, non distended with normal bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no edema.  Neurological exam revealed
the patient to be alert and oriented times three per son.
The patient was moving all four extremities with sensation
grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of
7.4, hematocrit 39.8, platelet count 205,000, INR was 1.5.
Urinalysis was negative.  The patient had a bicarb of 33 with
BUN of 21, creatinine 0.6.  The patient had a B12 of 513, TSH
1.4, negative tox screen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 85-year-old female with
history of CAD, hypertension, dementia and atrial
fibrillation admitted with change in mental status and
shortness of breath.

1.  Neurologic:  The patient presented with decreased
awareness and presence of somnolence on admission.  This was
thought to be multifactorial secondary to polypharmacy with
the patient taking Zyprexa, Aricept, Ativan and Ambien as
well as in the setting of CHF causing hypoxia.  The patient
had a toxic metabolic work-up that included normal TSH,
normal B12, normal RPR.  The patient was diuresed and Zyprexa
was held in an effort to improve the patient's mental status.
Throughout the time on the general medicine floor, the
patient's mental status was at baseline.  Her medications
were discussed with her outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 94651**]
who felt that the patient might benefit from a brief time in
the [**Hospital 1634**] [**Hospital **] Rehab.  The patient's family refused this.
The decision was made to restart the patient's Aricept and
try an alternative neuroleptic such as Risperdal.  The
patient will follow-up with her outpatient psychiatrist.
Evaluation by physical therapy felt that the patient was
stable for discharge to home.  The patient refused any rehab
placement.

2.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient presented with
increasing shortness of breath likely leading to hypoxia and
change in mental status.  With diuresis of 1 to 1.5 liters
per day, the patient had marked improvement in oxygenation
and was able to have a saturation of 93% on room air and
return to her baseline mental status.  She likely will need
to be discharged on Lasix.  An echocardiogram was performed
which showed normal LV function, left atrial abnormality,
trace AR and mild MR.  She will be followed by her primary
care physician who is also in cardiology.

3.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient presented to the
hospital in atrial fibrillation after being in sinus.  The
patient's case was discussed with her outpatient
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] who felt that anticoagulation would
be risky in a patient with high likelihood of fall.  She was
continued on Aspirin.

4.  Renal:  The patient presented with contraction alkalosis
and this increased with diuresis.  She was given potassium
chloride with some improvement in her alkalosis.  Her
creatinine remained stable throughout the admission.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged with follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] in one week.  She will also follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 94651**] in [**1-12**] weeks.  The patient was advised to
discontinue Zyprexa, Ambien and Ativan.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Included Pravachol 20 mg po q day,
Zoloft 100 mg po q day, Aricept 10 mg po q day, Aspirin 325
mg po q day, Multivitamin one orally daily, Diltiazem 240 mg
po q day, Lasix 20 mg po bid, Tylenol 650 mg po q 4-6 hours
prn pain, Dulcolax one po q day for constipation prn,
Risperdal 0.5 mg po bid as needed for agitation.

The patient will have a creatinine and potassium checked in
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**].

1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Polypharmacy.
