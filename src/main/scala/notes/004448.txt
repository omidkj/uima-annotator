CT abd/pelvis ([**10-5**], reviewed with radiology resident): [**2-22**]
intraparenchymal R hepatic abscesses (not noted on OSH read),
non-organized fluid collections in LUQ, R abd, pelvis.

ERCP ([**10-6**]): extravasation at cystic duct c/w large bile leak;
filling defect in bile duct c/w sludge; sphincterotomy, sludge
extraction, and biliary stenting performed.

Reviewed cholangiogram images with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]: given location
of clips (and abscesses), R hepatic artery was likely taken in
lap chole instead of cystic artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2103-10-6**], the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.
Extravasation at cystic duct was noted.  Sphincterotomy, sludge
extraction, and biliary stenting were performed.
[**Name (NI) 1917**], pt was unable to be extubated and was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He became hypotensive and is currently
being resuscitated with NS (also hyponatremic).  OGT was placed,
150cc feculent material drained.  After surgical consultation,
the patient was transferred to the TISCU on the hepatobiliary
surgery service.  He rapidly deteriorated - despite 4-5L IVF in
and 4 pressors at max dose, SBP in mid-80s.  Increasing vent
requirements.  Bladder pressure 14 on arrival, increased to 21.
Increasing lactate (~5), acidosis (pH<7.2, bicarb 15), Cr (1.5).
 Duplex US of liver failed to demonstrate R hepatic arterial
flow.  TEE performed by TSICU team demonstrated minimal cardiac
function, EF~20%.  Case discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and IR.  Pt was
too unstable for operative intervention.  IR did not believe his
liver lesions are organized enough to drain at this time.
Supportive management w/ bicarb gtt (BP is responsive to this -
SBP 90s-115), pressors, antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn,
meropenem).  Both TSICU and Hepatobiliary Surgery teams have
discussed critical nature of situation with family.

On [**2103-10-7**], family consented to bedside exploratory
laparotomy, where 3 liters of bilious fluid wer drained from the
peritoneal space.  The attempt at abdominal decompression did
not significantly improve ventilation or cardiovascular
function.  By [**2103-10-8**], the patient remained in critical
condition with no interval improvement.  After discussion with
the family, the patient was rendered CMO and he expired.
