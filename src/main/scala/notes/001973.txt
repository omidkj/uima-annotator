Service:  GENERAL SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
woman with a previous medical history of coronary artery
disease and hypothyroidism who presented to the Medical
Service a couple of days ago with "constipation".  During
further observation and workup, the patient has been found to
have an obstructing lesion in the distal transverse colon and
presents to the Surgical Service with a massively dilated
cecum secondary to the obstructing colon lesion.  The patient
was admitted to the Surgical Service for laparotomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Hypothyroidism.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Synthroid.
2.  Fosamax.
3.  Zoloft.
4.  Lopressor.
5.  Lasix.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  On admission to
the Surgical Service, the patient presented with a distended
abdomen and tenderness in the right part of the abdomen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2108-3-9**] for exploration.  A massively dilated cecum
secondary to an obstructing lesion in the splenic flexure was
found.  Considering the patient's age and somewhat unstable
condition, it was decided to only do a cecostomy at this
procedure.

The patient underwent that procedure without complications
and had a relatively uneventful postoperative course.  The
patient was then taken back to the Operating Room on [**2108-3-21**]
for a definitive procedure regarding her obstructing colon
cancer.  At that procedure, a right hemicolectomy was
performed.

The patient's initial postoperative course was relatively
uneventful.  Subsequently, the patient developed pulmonary
insufficiency and on postoperative day number eight, after
the right hemicolectomy, the patient's family made the
patient DNR and she expired on the following day, [**2108-3-30**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Obstructing colon cancer.
2.  Status post exploratory laparotomy and cecostomy.
3.  Status post right hemicolectomy.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
