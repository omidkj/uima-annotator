Pertinent Results:
[**2119-10-31**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate impairment
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate to
severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.
POSTBYPASS
The patient is receiving dobutamine at 7ucg/kg/min.
RV systolic function is improved. There is now mild RV
hypokinesis with minimal focality. LV systolic function is
marginally improved, LVEF ~25%. There is a well seated, well
fumctioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position. There is a
mild perivalvular leak. TR is now mild (1+). The remaining study
is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79441**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2119-10-30**] for a cardiac
catheterization in anticipation of his aortic valve surgery. His
cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel coronary artery
disease. Mr. [**Known lastname 79441**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner and was ready for surgery.

On [**2119-10-31**] he was taken to the Operating Room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels and an
aortic valve replacement using a tissue prosthesis. (Please see
operative note for details.) He weaned from bypass on
Dobutamine,Propofol and Neosynephrine in stable condition.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring.

Over the next 24 hours he had awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. Pressors were weaned off and he remained stable.
Beta blockade and aspirin were resumed. On postoperative day
one, he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility.
Oxygenation remained low and a CXR revealed what appeared to be
a large left effusion. A left lung thoracentesis was performed
on [**11-4**] yielding 500 mL of serosanguinous fluid.  A repeat CXR
demonstrated an elevated left diaphragm with atelectasis and
resolution of the effusion.  His oxygenation improved and he
felt better.

He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further
recovery prior to going home.  He will continue on diuretics for
a week as he remained above his preoperative weight.
Arrangements were made for follow up with his cardiology,
medical and surgical providers.
