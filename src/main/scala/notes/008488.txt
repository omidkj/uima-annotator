Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sudafed / Erythromycin Base / Optiray 300 / Levaquin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5141**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy with argon laser treatment, phototherapy
Flexible bronchoscopy.
Mechanical debridement of right mainstem bronchial tumor.
Therapeutic aspiration of secretions in the right middle and
lower lobes.


History of Present Illness:
52 year-old female with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to hip
and lung admitted with hemoptysis. She underwent debulking of
right mainstem endobronchial tumor on [**2126-2-20**] by rigid
bronchoscopy; at that time, argon plasma injection with plan for
repeat debulking in the future. Post-procedure, she had cough
productive wtih green/yellow sputum but otherwise felt well. On
day prior to admission, she had injection with photosensitive
chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (Photofrin) with plan for debulking on
Friday, [**2126-3-15**]. Following procedure experienced experienced
hemoptysis x15 minutes; also with SOB.
.
She present to OSH ED for further evaluation. At OSH, she
required 4L NC to maintain oxygen saturation in mid-90s. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, HR 88, BP 100/palp, RR 16, O2Sat 98% 4L NC.
Weaned supplemental oxygen to 3L NC. She had three episodes of
hemoptysis. SBP dropped to 60s during one episode of hemoptysis,
and improved to low 100s after 3L IVF NS. Laboratory data
significant for hematocrit 31.3 (31.1 at last discharge),
chemistry panel within normal limits, lactate 1.1. CXR 2V with
numerous pulmonary nodules not changed from prior CT; no new
consolidation or effusion; right chest portacath. CTA chest was
considered given risk for pulmonary embolism, but was not
completed due to contrast allergy. V/Q was also considered, but
could not be performed due to scheduling. Decision was made for
MRA chest in ED, but was not completed. She was seen by
interventional pulmonology, who recommended intra-operative
evaluation for active bleeding. She was sent directly from ED to
OR to have rigid bronch performed. She in received total of 3L
IVF in ED with SBP in 100s prior to transfer to OR.
.
In the OR, noted to have extrinsic compression of right mainstem
bronchus, polypoid mass in RLL, and several large blood clots in
RLL. Underwent laser therapy of mass. Will go back to OR for
repeat intervention as originally planned on [**2126-3-15**]. Of note,
given Photofrin, she is very light sensitive - q30 checks for
saturation (not continuous); must be dark room, otherwise risk
for burn.
.
In the PACU, was originally on 3L NC, though felt dyspneic and
noted to have O2Sat of 91%. She was given albuterol neb and put
on 6L by neb mask. Her dyspnea resolved. Had one episode of
hemoptysis productive of pink sputum. She had minimal pain and
received morphine 2 mg IV x 2.
.
On arrival to MICU, patient reports intermittent cough with
associated dyspnea. Reports some pink sputum with flecks of
blood. Admits to some fatigue. Denies fevers, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain.

Chest films
[**3-12**]:
FINDINGS: Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates numerous
pulmonary
nodules, not significantly changed when compared with prior.
There is no new
parenchymal consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. A
right chest metaport is stable in appearance with its tip at the
cavoatrial
junction.

IMPRESSION: Grossly stable appearance of numerous pulmonary
metastases,
without new consolidation.

[**3-19**]:
FINDINGS: Compared to most recent prior, there has been interval
development
of right upper lobe opacification and volume loss, concerning
for collapse.
Right hilar mass is seen, which may be obstructing the right
upper lobe
bronchus. There is improved aeration of the right lower lung.

IMPRESSION: Right hilar mass with complete opacification of the
right upper
lobe, concerning for postobstructive collapse.

[**3-23**]:
COMPARISON: Prior study obtained the same day earlier at 12:10
p.m.:

No pneumothorax is demonstrated on the current study, and the
findings are
most likely related to a combination of healed fractures and
pleural
thickening. Multiple masses are redemonstrated as well as right
upper lobe
collapse. Overall, there is slight improvement of the right
basal aeration as
compared to the studies obtained on [**3-20**] and [**3-19**].

Brief Hospital Course:
52 yo F with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to hip and lung
admitted with hemoptysis and found to have an obstructing RUL
mass.  Initially transferred to MICU following rigid bronch with
photodynamic therapy and blood clot extraction in OR by
interventional pulmonology.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:

#. RUL mass
- Large endobronchial tumor obstructing the right upper lobe
takeoff and protruding into the right bronchus intermedius found
during rigid bronchoscopy on [**3-12**].
- IP visualized clot and extracted it, and also performed a
partial resection and coagulation of the obstructive lesion with
subsequent improvement in RLL aeration
- The patient was observed in the MICU for 6 days without
incident, was taken back for bronchoscopy on [**3-15**] and [**3-18**] for
debridement and photodynamic therapy, see operative reports for
details
- During the last two procedures the [**Hospital1 **] was found to be patent,
but the area behind the obstructing lesion was noted to be full
of purulent secretions
- These secretions were aspirated by the IP team, with concern
for post obstructive pneumonia
- Her oxygenation improved, and she was then transferred to the
floor on [**3-18**]
- She will be seen by the IP team in 2 weeks for follow up
bronchoscopy, no further debridement took place during her
admission

# Post obstructive pneumonia
- She was started on a course of IV vanc/cefepime in the MICU,
no culture data available from bronchoscopy
- Completed an 8 day course of therapy on [**3-23**]
- Consistency and frequency of purulent secretions improved over
the course of her stay on the floor with no signs of recurrent
or persistent pneumonia
- Supportive therapies included albuterol and ipatropium nebs,
guaifensin, chest PT, and frequ
