Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Last Name (un) 1372**]-tracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 50 year old female with PMH of multiple c-spine
operations with hardware in place, perforated Zenker's
diverticulum in [**2140**] with subsequent seeding of hardware and
development of paravertebral abscess and polymicrobial spine
osteo with complicated course requiring multiple spinal revision
operations, recurrent infections attributed to esophageal
perforations and development of paravertebral/retroesophageal
abscess with prior esophageal communication (not communicating
on MRI [**2144-6-23**]), on chronic opiates/benzos for pain/anxiety, and
malnutrition presenting with tachypnea, fevers, congested cough,
and cyanotic extremities. She was hospitalized from [**2144-6-29**] -
[**2144-7-4**] for malnutrition and dark stools (guaiac negative) and
had J-tube placement on [**7-16**]. She was found by her boyfriend to
be nonverbal and tachypneic to the 40s when he came home from
work this evening and she was brought to the hospital by
ambulance.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T=99.2, HR=105, BP=139/86, RR=38,
POx=99% on NC.  Per the ED, the patient was breathing at a rate
in the 40s, but satting well on nasal cannula, tachycardic, and
normotensive.  A CXR was unremarkable and she was given
albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments.  She was also given
vancomycin empirically with the plan to receive meropenem upon
arrival to the ICU.  The patient appeared anxious and lorazepam
was administered given that she is on chronic high doses of
benzodiazepines at home.  Vascular access was obtained with a
triple lumen inserted into her right groin, but no A-line was
placed.  She was then noted to have increased work of breathing
and desaturated to 70-80% despite maximal nasal cannula.  Given
her complicated cervical neck pathology, anesthesia was called
and performed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-tracheal intubation through her left
nostril and she was sedated on versed and fentanyl.  She quickly
dropped her blood pressures with sedation and Levophed drip was
started.  Upon transfer to the MICU vitals were noted to be
afebrile, HR=144, BP=133/89, RR=43 over breathing her vent
settings which was set at a RR=20 with a PEEP=8 and 100% FiO2.


Past Medical History:
- [**5-15**] Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion at C5-6 with left
iliac crest tricortical graft arthrodesis with anterior plating
from C5 to C6 for C5/C6 disc herniation with severe R
radiculopathy, RUE pain/weakness
- [**8-18**] Esophageal Perforation thought due to ruptured Zenker's
diverticulum, complicated by epidural abscess, cervical
osteomyelitis, and infected hardware. Went for I and D, with
removal of hardware at C5-C6, and revision of C5/C6 diskectomy,
new C6/C7 diskectomy. Cultures grew out Strep viridans, Strep
milleri, lactobacillus, Prevotella, MSSA.
C/b wound infection, delirium, VRE-infected pleural effusion, C
diff. Discharged on prolonged course of multiple abx.
- Thrombosis of the L vertebral artery, discovered during
hospitalization for esophageal perforation.
- In [**10/2141**] developed bilateral upper extremity paresthesias
and presented to the hospital with worsening cervical
osteomyelitis, collapse of C5, C6 vertebral bodies, C7
subluxation causing cord compression and b/l UE radiculopathy ->
[**11-17**] C4-T1 arthrodesis, C5-C7 corpectomies, hardware placement.
Unfortunately, this procedure was complicated by recurrence of
her posterior esophageal perforation, which was repaired with an
SCM flap and stent placement, and another removal of her
cervical hardware.
- Reexploration in [**1-/2142**] after barium swallow revealed
extravasation of contrast from one of the posterior drains in
her neck. This revealed a large, persistent esophageal
perforation. Stent was removed and new stent placed. Cultures
grew MRSA and viridans streptococcus. She was discharged with a
persistant neck fistula.
- [**12-22**] - admission for AMS, fevers, and dysarthria, found to
have prevertebral abscess, maintained on chronic suppressive
antibiotics.
- Otolaryngology surgery for chronic fistula and neck infection
planned but not yet performed.
- [**5-/2144**] - represented with AMS, slurred speech - no change in
prevertebral collection on imaging, was found to have multifocal
PNA, likely aspiration
- advanced emphysema on [**1-20**] CT
- Anxiety
- PTSD
- asthma
- allergic Rhinitis
- tonsillectomy

Social History:
She is smoker (up to 2-3ppd) but trying to quit now, no EtOH, no
drugs. Has current supportive boyfriend. Formerly worked as a
pharmacist. Family situation is stressful with two grown
children with neuro-cognitive/psychiatric disabilities after
they were assaulted by their father as children. A third child
perished in this attack. Has visiting nurses daily,
speech/swallow, and pain management who see her at home.

The patient was found by her boyfriend to be nonverbal and
tachypneic to the 40s when he came home from work this evening
and she was brought to the hospital by ambulance.   Shortly
after arrival in the ED, the patient was intubated, sedated, and
started on levophed.  She was also given antibiotics, nebulizer
treatments, and an anxiolytic prior to intubation.  Upon
transfer to the MICU vitals were noted to be afebrile, HR=144,
BP=133/89, RR=43 over breathing her vent settings which was set
at a RR=20 with a PEEP=8 and 100% FiO2.  She was also noted to
have an elevated lactate, an elevated troponin, acidemia, and
elevated LFTs.
.
She was paralyzed with vecuronium and started on a cisatracurium
drip on arrival to the MICU given her overbreathing and
inability to synch with the vent.  She was also noted to have a
blown left pupil on exam and sluggish right pupil which were new
for her suggesting an acute neurological event, but a head CT
could not be performed given her medical instability.  An EKG
was performed which showed sinus tachycardia.  Her blood
