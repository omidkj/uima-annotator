Chief Complaint:
Increasing shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2201-1-26**] Atrial Septal Defect Repair with Bovine Pericardial
Patch, and Atrial Thrombectomy

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 20948**] is a 46 yo female with increasing SOB over past 3
weeks, associated with a 20 punds weight gain. She also noted
acrocyanosis one week prior to admission. Echo at outside
hospital reported large atrial septal defect wtih primarily left
to right shunt. There was moderate right ventricular dilatation,
moderate right ventricular hypokinesis with moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Echo also notable for a four centimeter clot in
the right atrium. Prior to surgical intervention, she underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed normal coronary arteries.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical
intervention.

Physical Exam:
PREOP EXAM:
Vitals: 98.7, 101/60, 92, 18, 95% 3L
NAD lying in bed
Neuro A&O nonfocal exam
Lungs with decreased breath sounds at both bases, fine crackles
Heart Irregular
Abdomen benign, obese
Extrem warm, 2+ BLE edema, Rash on bilateral ankles

Pertinent Results:
[**2201-1-23**] Transthoracic ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest across a large secundum atrial septal defect. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The number
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2201-1-26**] Intraop TEE: PREBYPASS: A definite large (3.1cmx2cm)
thrombus in the right atrial appendage. There is a bidirectional
shunt across the interatrial septum at rest. A large secundum
atrial septal defect is present. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. POSTBYPASS: Pt was removed from cardiopulmonary bypass
on epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions and was AV paced. 1.
The large ASD has been subsequently repaired; there is no
evidence of flow across the intraatrial septum. 2. The RV
remains markedly dilated with moderate global hypokinesis. 3. LV
remains with mild left ventricular hypokinesis without evidence
of regional wall abnormalities. 4. Aortic contours are intact
post decannulation.
[**2201-1-29**] CXR: The cardiomegaly is unchanged. The post-sternotomy
wires are intact. Bibasilar consolidations consistent with
atelectasis are grossly unchanged, still significant. There is
no appreciable pleural effusion, and there is no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was started on a heparin drips. She was started on cipro for
a UTI. She was taken to the operating room on [**1-26**] where she
underwent an atrial thrombectomy and ASD repair. She was
transferred to the ICU in critical but stable condition on epi
and propofol. She was given 48 hours of vancomycin as she was in
the hospital preoperatively. She was extubated later that same
day. She was started on fluconazole for the rash on her ankles.
She was started on coumadin. She was transferred to the floor on
POD #1.  Over the next several days the patient was gently
diuresed, she was started on Bblockers and was anticoagulated.
She has been in AFib with a rapid ventricular rate, up to the
140's with activity.  By POD #7, after her Lopressor had been
increased, her heart rate was better controlled. She was also
started on Keflex for an IV site phlebitis. She is now stable,
and ready to be discharged home.  Her Coumadin will be followed
by the [**Hospital 40198**] [**Hospital **] Clinic ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 77855**]), [**Doctor Last Name **] has been
notified, and records faxed to her there.
