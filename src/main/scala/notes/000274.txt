Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3298**]
Chief Complaint:
L knee pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2190-10-13**]: s/p left total knee replacement revision - rotating
hinge


History of Present Illness:
(Per Orthopedic Admission Note)
Mr. [**Known lastname **] previously had a total knee replacement performed in
[**2174**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26181**].  This was revised due to loosening in [**2184**]
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 82679**].  He required an allograft prosthetic
reconstruction.  At that point in time, the allograft fractured
following a fall.  In addition, the [**Doctor Last Name 3549**] taper between
the tibial component and the tibial stem has become disengaged
and has been disengaged for several years.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presents
with chronic pain and requires a revision.  As pt presented for
elective surgery other review of systems unremarkable and
feeling well.

OTHER STUDIES
==============
Knee Radiograph [**2190-10-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
Intact left total knee revision. No complications.

ECG [**2190-10-14**]:
Rapid regular tachycardia, rate 110. There is complete right
bundle-branch
block. Atrial activity is not visible on the current tracing.
There is marked ST segment depression in leads V2-V6. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2188-3-25**] the complete left
bundle-branch block and the ST segment depressions are new and
consisetnt with acute ischemia.

ECG [**2190-10-15**]:
Sinus tachycardia. The P-R interval is prolonged. Left axis
deviation. Right bundle-branch block with left anterior
fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2190-10-14**]
the rate is slower and ST segment depression is no longer
present.

TTE [**2190-10-15**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with distal inferior hypokinesis. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and (top normal) transvalvular gradients. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-3-24**], a
aortic bioprosthesis is now seen. In addition very focal distal
inferior hypokinesis is now seen.

Head CT [**2190-10-15**]:
Impression:
1. Bilateral periventricular hypodensities likely representing
chronic
ischemic changes. There is a right caudate infarct of
undeterminate age. If anacute infarct is suspected, MRI is
recommended for further evaluation.

2. Dense opacification of the left maxillary sinus with
calcification may
represent fungal infection.

Unilateral Upper Extremity Ultrasound [**2190-10-16**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.

Studies Pending at Discharge:
Blood Cultures from [**10-14**] and [**10-15**] remained negative at
discharge but will be held for a full week each.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 86 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, BPH admitted following
left total knee arthroplasty revision which was complicated by
significant intra-operative and post-operative blood loss and
hypotension. He was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit and his hospital course was notable for acute blood
loss anemia requiring 12 units pack red blood cells in total as
well as cardiac biomarker elevation related to increased demand
from anemia, hypotension, and tachycardia.

#Revision of left knee arthroplasty/Intra- and Post-Operative
Acute Blood Loss Anemia/Hypotension:
Patient suffered 1.2L blood loss in the OR and had
intraoperative hypotension. He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit where he was transfused to a hematocrit of
>30 which required 12 units in total including in the OR.
Following hemodynamic stabilization the patient was transferred
to the medical floor where betablockers and diuretics were
restarted.  He was also started on prophylactic anticoagulation
with no signs of active bleeding.

#CAD s/p CABG/NSTEMI:
Following surgery the patient developed an elevation in his
cardiac biomarkers with elevation in TnT but without elevation
in CK-MB index. It was felt this was reflective of potential
fixed obstruction with increased cardiac demand from
hypotension, anemia, tachycardia, and withholding of home
beta-blockers. Cardiology was consulted who felt there was no
further intervention required. An echocardiogram was obtained
which showed only a focal distal inferior hypokinesis which was
not felt to represent an acute coronary syndrome as detailed
above. EF was preserved. Patient was continued on aspirin,
betablocker, and statin when hemodynamically stable.

#Chronic diastolic heart failure:
Initially beta-blockade and diuretics were held, b
