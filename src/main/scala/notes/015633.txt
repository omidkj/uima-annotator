Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted [**2131-3-6**] for an elective cardiac cath
showing 3 VD.  He was referred for CABG.  On [**3-7**] he proceeded
to the OR for a CABG x 3 with LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the RCA,
and SVG to the OM1.  Please see OP note for full details.  He
was successfully weened and extubated in his operative evening.
On POD one his BUN and creatinine elevated (creat 1.7 from 1.4)
and a renal consult was obtained.  The elevated creatinine was
attributed to an early underlying diabetic nephropathy or ATN --
with full recover expected.
On POD three he was transferred to the inpatient/telemetry floor
for ongoing management.
On POD four he sustained rapid bursts of atrial fibrillation
treated with IV lopressor and amiodarone.  He continued with
bursts of afib throughout that day and the next and was started
on IV heparin and PO coumadin on POD 5.
On POD five he was also noted to have a small amount of drainage
from the lower most pole of his sternal incision.
On POD 6 his lopressor was further increased with ongoing atrial
fibrillation.  His blood glucoses were elevated to the mid-200s
and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained for better management of
diabetes.
On POD eight, his sternal drainage was thought to have increased
in volume with small amount of purulent drainage and he
proceeded to the OR for exploration (INR 1.2).  Sternal wound
debridement in the OR revealed small amount of pus in the
subcutaneous tissue at the top portion of the incision;
debrided; closed with interrupted sutures.
On PODs [**8-16**] he converted from afib to a NSR.  He was also
continued on vancomycin (started post-debridement) with qid
dressing changes.  He continued to be followed by physical
therapy with increasing activity level and was continued on his
coumadin.
On POD [**9-16**], his vancomycin was discontinued and he was started
on PO keflex.  His INR elevated to 1.9.
On PODs 13/5 it was decided that he was safe for discharge home
with sternum stable without further drainage, NSR, appropriate
activity level per physical therapy.
It was decided that he would go home with PO amiodarone but no
coumadin since he had remained in a NSR without any atrial
fibrillation for 4 days.
