IMAGING DATA:
CT chest:[**2165-6-21**]
1. Large, probably loculated right pleural effusion and smaller
volume of pleural air, projecting through the intercostal plane
into the submuscular right chest wall, probably facilitated by
separated surgical rib fractures.
2. Diffuse narrowing, right bronchial tree distal to the main
bronchus, not due to hematoma.
3. Moderately severe atelectasis, right lung, probably due to a
combination of bronchial narrowing and restriction by thickened
pleura and pleural effusion. No right pleural drain is seen
currently.

CXR [**6-27**]
There is no change from [**2165-6-26**]. The right chest tube remains
in place. Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated
atelectasis, right greater than left, are stable. The cardiac
and
mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are unchanged. A
small
right apical air collection is stable without evidence of
tension. Subcutaneous air in the right chest wall is again
noted.
The left PICC ends in the mid to low SVC.

Echogardiogram
[**2165-7-2**]:
A patent foramen ovale is present. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. A
patent foramen ovale was present.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted [**2165-6-18**] from the thoracic clinic
following thoracentesis for 600 mL and placement of a right
pigtail. Serial chest films revealed no change in right pleural
effusion and pneumothorax. Chest CT [**2165-6-21**] revealed a
loculated effusion and the patient had a rising white count. She
was taken to the operating room for a Right VATS (video-assisted
thoracic surgery) exploration, right thoracotomy and
decortication, flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar
lavage. Intraoperative she was found to a have a couple
purulence pockets which was drained and cultures sent.  She was
started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. The cultures were MRSA
vancomycin sensitive. The Zosyn was discontinued and a week
course of Vancomycin was continued. She transfer to the PACU was
hypotensive and tachycardic requiring pressors and volume and
was transfer to the TICU with MAPs in the 70's.  Overnight she
improved titrated off pressors with MAPs > 60. She was given IV
fluids. Her free water was restricted for hyponatremia and she
normalized over the next 48 hrs. Her Lopressor was restarted for
occasional ectopy. On [**2165-6-24**] she remained stable and was
transfer to the floor. Below is a systems review of her hospital
course:

Respiratory: Nebulizers and incentive spirometry were continued,
and she titrated off oxygen with saturations of 93-97% on room
air.

Chest tubes: She had right anterior and basilar chest tubes.
Once the culture were finalized the anterior chest tube was
removed on [**2165-6-26**] and the basilar converted to a Pneumostat
and will slowly be removed over several weeks to prevent a
pocket formation.

Cardiac: The patient remained hemodynamically stable in sinus
rhythm 80-90's with no further ectopy. Her Lopressor was
continued.  Blood pressures were 140-150's and her HCTZ was
restarted.  She continued to be hypertensive.  Amlodipine 2.5 mg
daily was started [**2165-7-2**].

GI: PPI and bowel regime

Nutrition: tolerated a regular diet

Renal: The patient developed climbing creatinine on [**2165-6-27**]
plateau to 2.2 on discharge was 2.0. This was felt to be due to
vancomycin which was discontinued [**2165-6-27**].  Her urine output was
excellent.

ID: She remained afebrile. Leukocytosis peak 27 which normalized
following empyema drainage and antibiotics. She was initially
started on vanc/Zosyn per above history but changed to
ceftaroline 400mg IV bid on [**2165-6-28**] switched to 300mg IV bid
(renal dosing). C.diff x 2 was negative. TEE on [**2165-7-1**] was
negative for endocarditis.

Pain: The patient had confusion with narcotics transition to
Lidoderm patch
