states that he tested HIV negative before getting married and
has had no risk factors since marriage.  He denied any recent
sick contacts.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was hypotensive and
tachycardiac and given 2 liters normal saline, 1 gram of
ceftriaxone IV and 500 mg of azithromycin p.o.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient denied previous
hospitalizations or surgeries.  He has not seen a doctor in
many years.

ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denied tobacco.  He says that he drinks
about one pint of cognac per day as well as six beers.  He
denied any IV drug use or other drugs.  The patient is

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs on admission
will be added later.  General:  Sitting up, slightly
tachypneic, speaking in full sentences.  HEENT:  Clear
conjunctivae, anicteric sclerae.  The pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  The oropharynx was clear.  Tympanic membranes were
pearly white bilaterally.  Neck:  No LAD, no JVD, supple,
nontender.  Lungs:  With decreased breath sounds on the right
lower half of the lung with positive egophony, decreased
tactile fremitus and dullness to percussion over the same
area.  The left lung was clear to auscultation with no
wheezes, crackles, or rubs.  Cardiovascular:  There were no
heaves.  There was a rapid irregular rhythm, normal S1, S2,
no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel
sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses.  Back:  No
CVA tenderness.  Extremities:  There was no clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were +2
bilaterally.  Skin:  Warm and moist.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 12.6, 83 polys, 30
bands, 3 lymphs, 2 monos, hematocrit 38.2, platelets 130,000.
Sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, bicarbonate 23, BUN
17, creatinine 1.3, glucose 149.

The initial chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe opacity,
atelectasis versus consolidation.  A lateral decubitus film
showed free flowing right-sided effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Medicine.
After arriving on the floor, the patient became increasingly
tachypneic and his oxygen saturations were gradually
decreasing.  The patient looked to be working harder to
breathe.  The patient was also complaining of increasing
chest pain over the right anterior and lateral chest wall,
worse with inspiration.

The patient continued to deny headache, dizziness, nausea, or
vomiting.

An EKG was taken at that time which did not show acute
changes.  Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.34, PC02 39,
P02 61 while on 50% 02 face mask.

The patient was given morphine IV for chest pain which was
believed to be secondary to pneumonia and effusion.  The
patient was evaluated by the MICU and transferred to the MICU
for closer observation given his worsening respiratory status
and for thoracentesis of the right effusion.  Thoracentesis
was attempted by the MICU without yielding a significant
amount of fluid.  A small amount of fluid was sent for
culture and has been no growth to date.

A second attempt at tapping the effusion was performed by
Radiology with ultrasound-guidance but no fluid was
identified by ultrasound and no tap was attempted.

The patient had a CT scan on [**2158-1-23**] which showed a moderate
loculated right pleural effusion which had increased in size
from the chest x-ray from [**2158-1-21**].  There was a tiny left
effusion.  There was a multifocal consolidation bilaterally,
most severe in the right lower and middle lobes.  There was
slightly prominent mediastinal nodes.  There was also
enlargement of multiple nodes in the right hilar region.

The main pulmonary artery measured 33 mm in diameter
suggesting pulmonary hypertension.  Several images showed a
suggestion of excessive collapsibility of the lower trachea
which could indicated malacia.

The patient was transferred from the MICU to the floor on
[**2158-1-23**].  The patient's tachypnea had much improved as had
his hypoxia and oxygen requirements.  The patient continued
to have significant pleuritic right-sided chest pain which
has gradually improved.

On the night of [**2158-1-24**], under recommendation of the
Pulmonary Consult Service, Cardiothoracic Surgery was asked
to place a right chest tube to drain the loculated pleural
effusion noted on CT.  The patient tolerated this procedure
well.  The chest tube yielded serosanguinous fluid.  The
fluid had 3,350 white cells, 22,725 red cells, 25% polys, 56%
lymphs, 8% monos, 1% eos, 10 atypical cells.  Total protein
of the pleural fluid was 3.8 and LDH was 3,377, indicated
exudative fluid.

Gram's stain showed 1+ polys, no micro-organisms.  No
acid-fast bacilli were seen.  Other cultures are pending at
this time.  Also, a urine Legionella test was negative.
Blood cultures drawn on [**2158-1-22**] remained no growth to date.

The remainder of the hospital course and dictation is to
follow.
