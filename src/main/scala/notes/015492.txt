Cardiac cath [**12-23**]
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
patent LMCA. LAD had a proximal 20-30% non-hemodynamically
significant
lesion and was otherwise free of angiographically apparent
disease. LCX
was small. The RCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
2. Left ventriculography showed EF of 40-45% with hypokinetic
anterior
wall and hyperdynamic base.
3. Limited hemodynamic assessment showed normal systemic
pressures and
mildy elevated LVEDP.
4. Ascending aorta was dilated. There was no evidence of
dissection.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS [**12-24**]
CTA: There is aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta,
which measures 4.2 cm in diameter at the level of the pulmonary
vein confluence (series 4, image 31). The aortic arch and
descending thoracic aorta are of normal caliber. There is an
aberrant right subclavian artery arising from a diverticulum of
Kommerell off the aortic arch. There is caliber narrowing at the
origin of the celiac with post- stenotic dilatation noted. The
superior mesenteric, both renal arteries, and inferior
mesenteric arteries are patent. The common iliac, external and
internal iliac, and both femoral arteries are patent. No
abdominal aortic aneurysm is identified. There are no filling
defects in the pulmonary arterial vasculature. No pulmonary
embolism is identified.
.
[**12-24**] CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: Calcified nodule with associated
linear atelectasis is seen on series 4, image 37 in the right
lower lobe measuring approximately 6 mm in diameter. There is
biapical scarring noted. Small opacity is seen in the lingula
which could reflect atelectasis. There is a small amount of
bibasilar atelectasis present. No lung masses are present. No
pericardial or pleural effusion is present. The airways are
patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally. Small
fat-containing axillary lymph nodes are present bilaterally. No
enlarged mediastinal or hilar nodes are present.
.
[**12-24**] CT ABDOMEN: There are multiple nonobstructing stones within
the collecting systems of both kidneys. In the left upper pole,
there is a 3.5-mm stone. In the left mid pole, there is a 2-mm
nonobstructing stone. There is an additional 5- mm
nonobstructing stone in the mid pole of the left kidney. In the
left lower pole, there is a 4-mm nonobstructing stone. In the
upper pole of the right kidney, there is a 5.5-mm nonobstructing
stone, and in the interpolar region of the right kidney, there
is a 3-mm nonobstructing stone present. There is a simple cyst
in the interpolar region of the right kidney measuring 13 mm in
diameter. The adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, are normal in
appearance. The caliber of the loops of small and large bowel is
normal in appearance. Patient is status post cholecystectomy.
There are numerous low attenuation lesions throughout both lobes
of the liver, the largest of these is in the left lobe measuring
approximately 3.9 x 2.7 cm and is a simple cyst. Lesions smaller
than 5 mm are too small to characterize. Near the dome of the
liver, there is a 5-mm area of low attenuation that is
incompletely characterized on this study due to size (series 2,
image 50), of relative low attenuation. There is no ascites.
.
[**12-24**] CT PELVIS: There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
without diverticulitis. There is a Foley catheter in the
bladder. Patient has a prosthetic right hip screw fixation
device which creates significant artifact in this region. There
are phleboliths seen in the pelvis. There is no free fluid in
the pelvis. No enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes are seen.
There is ectasia of the abdominal aorta.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesion.
Degenerative changes are seen at L1-2 and L5-S1 consistent with
disc space narrowing. Lucent lesions are seen in the iliac bones
bilaterally adjacent to the sacroiliac joint, likely related to
cystic degenrative change.
.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior
septum and anterior wall. The remaining segments contract well.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent
with single
vessel coronary artery disease. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderately dilated aortic root and ascending aorta.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2171-12-27**] 3:37 PM
CHEST PA AND LATERAL: The heart size, mediastinal and hilar
contours are unremarkable. The lungs are clear. There are no
pleural effusions. The pulmonary va
