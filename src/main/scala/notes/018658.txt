Service:  [**Location (un) 259**] I

NOTE: Date of Discharge is expected to be [**2146-4-15**].

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Fevers and increased white blood cell
count.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85 year old female
with multiple medical problems who was sent in to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Room from her
nursing home for fevers and an increased white blood cell
count.  The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] from [**2146-3-17**] until [**2146-4-6**]
initially for shortness of breath and then had a prolonged
hospital course which included respiratory distress thought
secondary to a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare
from Pseudomonal pneumonia.

Other etiologies were entertained including allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis versus Turk-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**].  During
the patient's last admission she had intermittent shortness
of breath episodes that were treated with Lasix for pulmonary
edema.  She had also ruled out for an myocardial infarction
at that time.  Her hospital course at that time was also
complicated by a steroid induced myopathy, incidental thyroid
nodule with biochemically sick euthyroid, acute T12
compression fracture, ataxia attributed to steroid myopathy,
pancytopenia attributed to medication, and a PEG placement.

Upon evaluation for the current admission, the patient's
daughter stated that since her discharge, the patient's
mental status has been at baseline until the day prior to
admission when she became slightly more depressed.  She had
been calling out for her deceased mother.  The patient also
appeared confused and agitated.  At the nursing home, her
temperature was 101.1 F.; heart rate was 106 and respiratory
rate was 14.  She was saturating 94% on two liters and had
been placed on a nonrebreather by the EMS.

At the nursing home she had been given Ciprofloxacin,
Azithromycin and ceftazidime for one day.

Per the patient's daughter, the patient had not had any
headache, chest pain, change in her vision, diarrhea.  She
complained of mild abdominal diffuse pain.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a significant history of
tobacco use.  She resides at the [**Hospital3 2732**] home for
the past week since her discharge from the hospital.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On evaluation in the Emergency Room,
the patient was febrile with a temperature of 101.8 F.; blood
pressure 145/66; heart rate 110; respiratory rate 22; 99% on
a non-rebreather, 93% on room air at rest.  The patient
appeared sedated and was becoming agitated and combative at
times.  Her Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Her
neck was supple without any lymphadenopathy or bruits.  Her
oropharynx was dry and her mucous membranes were moist
without exudates.  She had fine crackles half way up
bilaterally on her lung examination and had occasional
expiratory wheezes.  She had no accessory muscle use.  Her
heart was regular rate and rhythm with S1, S2.  Her abdomen
was soft, nontender to deep palpation.  She had normoactive
bowel sounds and no guarding.  Her PEG site was clean, dry
and intact without erythema or drainage.  Her legs were in
lambs wool boots.  She had trace edema to the ankles.  There
were no cords or erythema present.  On neurologic
examination, she responded to commands by opening her eyes,
but appeared sedated.  She had no point tenderness over her
spine.  She had no sacral decubitus ulcers and no skin
ulcers.

LABORATORY:   Her labs were as follows on admission, white
blood cell count 19.8, hematocrit 29.7, platelets 671.  She
had 70% neutrophils and 7% bands.  Her electrolytes were as
follows:  Sodium 139, potassium 3.8, chloride 99, bicarbonate
29, BUN 18, creatinine 0.5, glucose 143.  Her lactate was
0.9.

Her first set of cardiac enzymes revealed the following:  A
CK of 30, MB of 3, troponin of 0.13.  Her second troponin was
0.15.  Her INR was 1.2.  Two sets of blood cultures and a
urine culture were drawn.  Her ALT was 25, alkaline
phosphatase 82, total bilirubin 0.2, lipase 78, amylase 83.

On urinalysis she had moderate leukocytes and moderate blood.
She had a white blood cell count of greater than 50 in her
urine and many bacteria.  There were three to five epithelial
cells.

Chest x-ray showed increasing rounded but ill defined opacity
in the left upper lobe, same as in [**2146-2-17**].  There
was a question of cavitary worsening left upper lobe opacity.

An EKG was done which showed sinus tachycardia at 108 with
normal intervals and left axis deviation.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1.  FEVERS:  Initially, the patient's fevers were thought to
be due to a urinary tract infection as seen on her urinalysis
upon admission.  She had been placed on Levaquin to treat for
the urinary tract infection, however, when the cultures came
back showing methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, the
patient was switched to Vancomycin.  Also, blood cultures had
been drawn upon admission.  The first set of blood cultures
ended up growth enterococcus which was resistant to
Vancomycin; thus, the patient's Vancomycin was discontinued
and the Levaquin was discontinued as well.  She was then
started on Linezolid.

An Infectious Disease consultation was obtained.  They
recommended that the patient undergo possible transesophageal
echocardiogram; however, given the patient's agitated state,
this test was not done.  She was kept on the Linezolid and
she was also started on clindamycin.  Per Infectious Disease
recommendations, the patient was to be kept on the Linezolid
for a total of three or four weeks.

The patient continued to have occasional spikes in her
temperature.  Surveillance blood cultures were drawn daily.
The patient daily did not complain of any sort of symptoms;
however, it was difficult to obtain a history daily given
that the patient has a baseline dementia.

2.  PULMONARY NODULE:  Given the presence of this pulmonary
nodule on chest x-ray upon admission, a CT scan was
recommended by a pulmonary consultation that had been
obtained in the early part of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course.
CT scan showed that the nodule had been present on a prior CT
scan but had slightly grown in size.  They were unable to
rule out whether this was TB versus aspergillosis.  Thus, the
patient was placed in isolation in order to have her ruled
out for tuberculosis.  Sputum was induced on multiple
occasions.  The first two sets of sputum cultures had no acid
fast bacilli on smear.  Cultures were pending.  The third set
at the time of this dictation has not been induced yet.

The patient had initially been placed on ceftazidime and
Ciprofloxacin in case this had been a recurrence of her
Pseudomonal pneumonia.  However, after an Infectious Disease
consul
