Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year old female
with a history of hypertension who presented with a collapse,
complaining of a headache. A CTA was done which showed a
subarachnoid hemorrhage with basilar artery aneurysm. She was
intubated for possible aspiration risk secondary to emesis.
She had a ventriculostomy drain placed in the emergency room.
She was loaded with Dilantin. She had a type and screen and
an arterial line placed for a strict blood pressure of less
than 140.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  HCTZ.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure of 174/80, pulse of
100. Her exam at that time revealed she was intubated. A hard
collar was in place. She blinked to threat and grimaced to
pain. Spontaneously moved her right upper extremity and
withdrew all limbs. Plantar responses and flexor.

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A CT showed subarachnoid blood in the
basal cisterns and the tip of basilar elongated aneurysm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was brought emergently to the
endovascular cerebral angio suite where she underwent a
coiling of a 9- x 4-mm basilar apex aneurysm coiled with GDC
Matrix coils. She was brought from the angio suite to the ICU
where her neurologic exam off propofol for 30 minutes showed
grimacing to tactile stimulation. No eye opening, no blink to
threat, spontaneous flexion at elbows and adduction, clearly
following commands, wiggling toes in a row, squeezes hands
bilaterally. Her blood pressure was 133/64, and her ICP was
10.

On her first postoperative day, she was following commands,
moving all limbs, and tracked the examiner. Her sedation was
weaned, and she was started on imodipine and subcutaneous
heparin. Her blood pressure was kept at 140, and her drain
was kept at 12. Also on her 1st postoperative day she was
extubated. Her arterial sheaths were removed. Her blood
pressure was kept strictly less than 140. On her 3rd
postoperative day, she was out of bed to a chair. She
remained alert and oriented. Her CVP was monitored to a goal
of 8 to 10; however, it was found to be in the high 20s. She
received Lasix and continued to diurese. Her blood pressure
goals were increased to 120 to 160, and she auto regulated on
her own with that. Her ICP was 6 to 9, and her
ventriculostomy drain remained at 12.

Throughout the first week of her stay in the ICU she
continued to have high CVPs and received daily Lasix. It was
felt just to be due to her weight and her fluid status. She
consistently would diurese large amounts with Lasix and have
a transitory trend downward in her CVP. She received an echo
on [**6-19**] which showed normal left ventricular wall function
and an overall ejection fraction of greater than 55%.

On [**6-22**] she had a head CT which showed a stable brain with
questionable slightly larger appearing vesicles. No areas of
infarct were identified. Her drain was clamped on [**6-23**] and
discontinued on [**6-25**]. She remained neurologically intact
through that clamping and had no transitory sites of ICP, and
no complaints of headaches. She has been advanced to a
regular diet and has been out of bed to chair t.i.d. working
with physical therapy.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  On [**6-26**], she was transferred to the
neuro stepdown unit where she worked with physical and
occupational therapy and was cleared to go home. She had no
further headaches and remained neurologically intact
throughout her hospital stay. Prior to discharge she is going
to have a head CT, the results of which are pending.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  To watch her head incision for
redness, drainage, or bleeding. She has a stitch in place
which should be removed by her primary care physician or here
on [**7-2**]. She should return if she develops a severe
headache not relieved by medication or has neurologic
changes.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  She is to follow up on
[**7-12**] at 1:00 p.m. with Dr.[**Name (NI) 9224**] office ([**Hospital Unit Name 107107**]). She should have her suture removed at her
primary care's office on or around [**7-2**] or come back to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Five between 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. We are going to
have 1 nursing visit for a home safety evaluation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Colace 100 mg 1 p.o. b.i.d.,
Keppra 500 mg 1 tablet p.o. b.i.d., and Percocet 5/325 1
tablet p.o. q.4-6h. as needed (#30).

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage, status post
rupture of basilar tip artery, status post coiling of basilar
tip artery. Other diagnosis includes hypertension.
