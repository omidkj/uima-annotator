Chief Complaint:
fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP ([**2146-11-17**])


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7631**] is a 64-year-old gentleman with history of
non-resectable pancreatic cancer s/p CBD stent in [**2145**] who
presented to OSH with band-like abdominal pain, fevers, chills,
nausea, and vomiting that began 2d PTA. Evaluation included LFTs
which were elevated and seemed consistent with obstructive
biliary process (TBili 12.5; Alk Phos 343; ALT 168; AST 87). He
was given Cefoxitin and IVFs. Given history, patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up and evaluation.
.
In the ED, VS were T 102.7; BP 128/71; HR 98; RR 18; 95% 2L. He
received cipro, flagyl, as well as ~4L IV fluids. He was then
transferred urgently to the ERCP suite. En route, patient
developed hypotension to 80s which responded to 2L IV fluid
boluses. In the ERCP suite, a single stricture that was 8mm long
was seen at the major papilla. This was c/w tumor ingrowth at
the level of the ampulla. Many stones ranging in size from 2mm
to 5mm along with large amount of sludge that were causing
obstruction were seen at the common bile and hepatic duct.
Sludge was drained and new stent was placed. He was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
On arrival to the ICU, VS were stable. Patient was slightly
lethargic but otherwise reported that he was doing well.
Abdominal pain was significantly improved. Denied breathing
difficulty or nausea.

Pertinent Results:
ERCP ([**11-17**]):
Stent in the major papilla.  Tissue ingrowth into the stent at
the level of the ampulla.  Large amount of stones and sludge
with in the stent in the common bile and hepatic duct.  Stones
and sludge were removed using a balloon.  Tissue ingrowth was
treated by placing another wall stent within the first stent.
(stone extraction, stent placement)

Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior films
available for comparison.

The heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
Bilateral vascular engorgement is demonstrated suggesting volume
overload. Linear opacity in the right lower lobe may represent
atelectasis. Left costophrenic angle was not included in the
field of view. No sizeable right pleural effusion is
demonstrated. There is no pneumothorax.

Cardiology Report	ECG	Study Date of [**2146-11-17**]  10:55:40 PM

Artifact is present. Atrial fibrillation. Probable right
bundle-branch
block. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes. No previous
tracing available
for comparison.

ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with normal LV diastolic function. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. There is a probable small (0.5x0.5cm)
vegetation versus focal thickening on the non-coronary cusp of
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular systolic and diastolic
function. A possible small vegetation versus focal thickening of
the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve. A TEE is recommended
if clinically indicated.
