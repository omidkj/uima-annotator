History of Present Illness:
72 year old female with known mitral regurgitation followed with
serial  echocardiograms that revealed left ventricular
remodeling and mild pulmonary hypertension. She has done well in
the past year with no cardiovascular complaints. Her activity
has been limited by her parkinson disease due to tremors which
she continues on sinemet.  She now presents for preoperative
cardiac catheterization and admission for mitral valve surgery.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2128-7-27**]
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically apparent coronary artery
disease. The
LMCA, LAD, LCx and RCA were normal.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and mildly
elevated left
sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 11 mm Hg and mean PCWP of
20 mm
Hg. The cardiac index was preserved at 3.9 l/min/m2. There was
mild
pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 42 mm Hg. There was moderate

systemic hypertension with SBP of 166 mm Hg and DBP of 70 mm Hg.


ECHO [**2128-7-28**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed.There is bilateral leaflet restriction, with
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation ,with severe
posterior mitral annular calicification. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Post
Patient is on a neosynephrine drip
There is now a 29 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **] bioprosthetic valve in place,well
seated with no paravalvular regurgitation
The mean gradient across the mitral valve is 8
The LV function is preserved
The aorta is similar to prebypass

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 80870**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2128-7-27**] for a
cardiac catheterization in preparation for her mitral valve
surgery. Her catheterization did not reveal any significant
coronary artery disease. Please see report for full details. She
was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On [**2128-7-28**], Mrs.
[**Known lastname 80870**] was taken to the operating room where she underwent a
mitral valve replacement using a 29mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic Porcine
valve. Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively
she was taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. Over
the next several hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely
fashion. Aspirin, Statin and beta blockade were resumed. On
postoperative day one she was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility. On
POD#3 mrs. [**Known lastname 80870**] developed brief episodes of atrial
fibrillation which resloved spontaneously and her betablocker
was increased. Her rhythm progressed to paroxysmal AFib and
several conversion pauses were noted. Anticoagulation was
initiated with Heparin and Coumadin held to assess the need for
procedural intervention. Electrophysiology was consulted. After
observing her rhythm, and allowing time for nodal recovery, a
PPM was deemed necessary for her sick sinus syndrome. POD# 9 she
underwent a PPM with a [**Company 1543**] 5076-45/PJN2140157.
She continued to progress and on POD# 12 she was cleared for
discharge to home by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. All follow up appointments
were advised.
