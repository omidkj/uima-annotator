Admission Date:  [**2108-3-7**]       Discharge Date:


Service:  Vascular Surgery

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral lower extremity ischemia

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old
gentleman who stopped working approximately seven years ago.
He had a brick contracting business which is now operated by
his son.  In mid [**Month (only) 956**], he noted that the right lower leg
and foot were somewhat cool.  He was admitted to [**Hospital3 2576**]
[**Hospital3 **] for a rather paroxysmal episode of pulmonary edema
and during the work up it was noted that his peripheral
vascular disease was profound and a bypass in these
extremities was planned.  However, the patient did not have
an angioscopy and eventually signed out against medical
advice from [**Hospital1 2025**].  Since then, his right foot improved
slightly.  He does have some discomfort in the right great
toe and also the medial aspect of the heel where a small
blister had developed while in the [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **].  He
does not have true rest pain at night and does not have
paresthesias in his foot.  Prior to his admission to [**Hospital1 2025**], the
patient stated that he was able to walk slowly about three
blocks.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has had a coronary artery
bypass graft three or four years ago and he is also status
post a cardiac catheterization while at [**Hospital1 2025**] a month ago.  He
also had prostatectomy approximately five years ago and he is
status post a stroke with no residual deficit.  However, he
did have a right sided hemiparesis approximately 10 years ago
from this stroke.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Carbamazepine 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].
2.  Digoxin 0.125 mg qd.
3.  Zestril 20 mg qd.
4.  Amiodarone 200 mg qd.
5.  Lasix 40 mg qd.
6.  Zocor 40 mg qd.
7.  Aspirin 325 mg qd.
8.  Lopressor [**1-22**] of a 60 mg tablet [**Hospital1 **].

PHYSICAL EXAM:  The patient is noted to be an elderly
gentleman with 4+ radial pulses bilaterally.  His carotid
pulses were normal with no bruits.  There were no aortic
bruits.  The left femoral pulse was 4+ with absent pulses
distal to that pulse on the right side.  There were no
femoral or distal pulses.  He had elevation pallor, right
greater than left, with mild coolness of the right with
comfort to the left and rubor that extends to the lower third
of the leg.  Motor, power and sensation are intact.  There is
a small collapsed blister on the medial aspect of the right
heel.  He has no lesion of the distal toes.  He had a small
damp lesion on the left medial malleolus which is probably a
traumatic ulcer.  The saphenous vein has been harvested in
the left leg and remains in the right.

Impression was that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a fairly advanced
ischemic lower extremity.  He underwent an angiogram which
showed bilateral iliac artery diseases.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was then taken to the Operating
Room on [**2108-3-7**] for an aortobifemoral bypass graft
which he tolerated well.  He was admitted to the hospital
following the surgery.  After the operation, the patient was
transported to SICU prior to Surgical Intensive Care Unit
where he remained intubated.  Postoperatively, while in the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient was noted to have a
progressively cooler left foot as compared to the right foot.
 His vascular pulse exam at this point was a dopplerable left
PT with a relatively faint DP and an equally strong DP and PT
with palpable signals.  However, the left foot was markedly
cooler as compared to the right foot, although it did not
look .............

On postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned off the
ventilator and he was extubated.  His distal pulse exam
remained as previously mentioned, where the left remained
cool, as compared to the right foot and the left DP, which by
this point was intermittently detectable by Doppler, the left
DP, the right DP and PT, however at this point remained
consistent with detectable Doppler.  The only other events
that the patient had postoperatively while in the Intensive
Care Unit were intermittent hypertension which responded well
with fluid boluses.  The cardiology service was involved in
the patient's care to the capacity where they followed him
until discharge given patient's strong cardiac history and
poor ejection fraction and prior echocardiogram.  As patient
improved, he was transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day #3, the patient was started on sips
while waiting for the return of his bowel function.  By this
time, the left foot which had been cool in the immediate
postoperative period had progressively became warmer and on
the vascular pulse exam, the DP on the left was now
consistently present by Doppler.  The patient was followed by
physical therapy and his level of activity was gradually
increased.  Initially, he was able to get out of bed to chair
with aid of physical therapy.  However, subsequently prior to
discharge, he was able to ambulate approximately 80 to 100
feet with a rolling walker.  The rest of Mr. [**Known lastname 111148**]
hospital course is essentially unremarkable.  There was
gradual improvement in his level of functioning where his
diet was gradually advanced and prior to discharge he was
tolerating a regular diet and his level of activity was
gradually advanced.  However, prior to discharge, he would
still benefit from physical therapy following discharge and
it is anticipated that the patient will go home with VNA
service, however the discussion of potential rehabilitation
is ongoing and will be addressed immediately prior to his
discharge.

At this point, it is anticipated the Mr. [**Known lastname **] will be
discharged home on [**3-13**] to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**] on
an outpatient basis.  VNA services have been arranged for him
to help with improving his physical strength.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is being discharged home
with VNA services.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is fairly stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Lower extremity ischemia.
2.  Status post an aortobifemoral bypass.
