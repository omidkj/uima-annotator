HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old male who
presented to his outpatient physician's office with complaint
of intermittent chest pain with exertion for the past three
days.  He had electrocardiogram changes, and so was sent to
arrival, he noted that his pain was similar to his previous
angina.  this pain/pressure radiated to both his arms and was
not associated with nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or
dyspnea.  He received 325 mg of aspirin in his primary
doctor's office.

In the Emergency Department of [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital he was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
catheterization with possible intervention given the ST
changes on his electrocardiogram; namely, ST depressions in
leads II and aVL, and ST elevations in II, III, and aVF.

He was pain free on arrival here and was taken to the
catheterization laboratory via Med-Flight.  He had an episode
of transient hypotension in the catheterization laboratory,
and so was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for monitoring.
He required one dose of atropine to which his blood pressure
responded well.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Coronary artery disease with a myocardial infarction
in [**2112**]; at which time a catheterization revealed an ejection
fraction of 55% with an 80% right coronary artery lesion, a
90% left anterior descending artery lesion that was stented,
and a 90% first obtuse marginal lesion that was
angioplastied.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Folic acid.
3.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Vitamin B12.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Multivitamin.
7.  Heparin drip.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:   His father died of coronary artery disease.
His mother has dementia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has a 30-pack-year history of smoking and
quit six years ago.  No calcium or cocaine use.  He lives
alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed a middle-aged man in no acute distress who was pain
free and afebrile.  He had a blood pressure of 114/72, and a
pulse of 71.  His oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters
nasal cannula.  His head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
examination was unremarkable.  His lungs were clear with no
rales.  He had no jugular venous distention.  His heart was
regular with distant heart sounds and no appreciable murmurs.
The abdomen was benign.  His extremities were warm and with
no edema.  His neurologic examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratory
data revealed a white blood cell count of 8.3, hematocrit
of 45.9, and platelet count of 324.  His blood urea nitrogen
was 16.  His creatinine was 1.4.  His potassium was 3.8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   His catheterization revealed a 90% left
circumflex lesion that was stented, an 80% stenosis of his
first obtuse marginal that was stented, a 40% mid left
anterior descending artery lesion, and an 80% mid right
coronary artery lesion.  He also had mild pulmonary arterial
hypertension with a pulmonary artery pressure of 33/22.  He
had mild increased left-sided filling pressures with a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 18.

Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital showed normal
sinus rhythm at 75 beats per minute, with normal axis and
normal intervals.  He had T wave flattening in V1.  He had
1-mm ST depressions in V1 and V2.  He had 2-mm ST depressions
in aVL.  He had ST elevations in II, III, and aVF.  There was
no fascicular block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 17437**] did well in the Coronary Care
Unit with no further episodes of hypotension.  His creatine
kinases peaked at 820 and then trended down.  He had no
recurrent chest pain, or shortness of breath, or arrhythmias
noted on telemetry.  He ambulated well on hospital day two.
He was continued on his aspirin, and Plavix, and Lipitor.  A
cholesterol panel showed a total cholesterol of 151,
triglycerides of 8, HDL of 42, and an LDL of 107.  He was
restarted on his beta blocker which he tolerated well, but
his blood pressures on the low end with systolics in the 90s
to 100s.  A low-dose ACE inhibitor (namely lisinopril 2.5 mg
q.d.) was started with no further decrease in his blood
pressure.  This can be increased as an outpatient as
tolerated.

An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2117-11-19**] which
revealed an ejection fraction of 45%.  He had a normal left
atrial and left ventricular size.  He had normal right
ventricular function.  He had mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.  He had basal and mid inferior hypokinesis.
There was no pericardial effusion.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   To follow up with his primary
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], in the next 7 to 10 days,
who will set him up for cardiac rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post acute inferior
posterior myocardial infarction.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Vitamin B12.
5.  Folate.
6.  Multivitamin.
7.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. (until [**2117-12-19**]).
