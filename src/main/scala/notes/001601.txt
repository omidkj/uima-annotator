Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo male with history of DMII, HTN and h/o Left TKR who
initially was admitted to the orthopedic service for revision of
TKR on [**6-14**] which failed [**3-7**] osteolysis and synovitis who
returned to the OR for revision of TKR.  The patient was
admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and was taken to the
operating room for above described procedure. Please see
separately dictated operative report for details. The surgery
was complicated by bleeding and the decision was made to stage
his reimplantation by one week. Post opertively he went to the
ICU.  He was then taken back for reimplantation of a hinged knee
prosthesis.  Post operative he again was transferred to the ICU
for monitoring. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
Small PE diagnosed by CT scan, patient started on coumadin for a
total of 6 weeks.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications.  The patient received
lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1 and
transitioned to coumadin after the PE was discovered.  The foley
was removed and the patient was voiding independently
thereafter. The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the
surgical incision was found to be clean and intact without
erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly
intact and the wound was benign.

At time of discharge, patient was deemed stable for safe
discharge to home.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as
tolerated on the operative extremity
