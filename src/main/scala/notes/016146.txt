History of Present Illness:
71 yo M with HTN, CHF, NIDDM, afib on Coumadin, who was leaning
over to pick up something, fell to the ground, hit his head on a
shelf, no LOC. No prodromal symptoms. Brought to [**Hospital3 **]

MICRO:
Urine Cx ([**9-28**]): No growth

IMAGING:
ECG ([**9-24**]): Sinus bradycardia at a rate of 55 with a premature
beat. Conducted complexes have P-R interval prolongation, left
atrial abnormality and right bundle-branch block morphology. The
premature beat may be an atrial premature beat.

CT Head ([**9-24**]): IMPRESSION: Acute hemorrhage in the right basal
ganglia with associated mass effect on the right lateral
ventricle. No shift in midline structures or evidence of brain
herniation.

CT C-spine ([**9-24**]): CONCLUSION:
1. No acute fracture. 3-mm retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 and
associated
degenerative changes at C3-C4 and C4-C5 levels.
2. Scarring at the lung apices with 11 x 10 mm opacity in the
right apex,
these lung changes can be assessed with a non-emergent CT chest.


TTE ([**9-24**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**9-24**]): CONCLUSION:
1. 45 x 24 mm pleural-based oval opacity at the right lung base
may represent round atelectasis, however, other etiologies are
not excluded and comparison with any prior imaging would be
invaluable. Otherwise, a followup chest CT in one month is
recommended to ensure stability/resolution.
2. Right tenth rib irregularity may represent prior partial
resection.
3. Bilateral renal hypodensities, some of which are clearly
cysts and others are too small to characterize.

CXR ([**9-24**]): IMPRESSION: No acute abnormality on limited portable
exam.

ECG ([**9-25**]): Sinus rhythm at a rate of 70. Right bundle-branch
block.

CXR ([**9-25**]): Since yesterday, right upper lobe thickening is
unchanged, could be related to old TB exposure and should be
evaluated by non-emergent chest CT. Comparison with old chest
x-ray would also be helpful. Lungs are otherwise clear. Clips
are projecting over the right hilum and the left upper abdominal
quadrant. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
are normal. There is no pleural effusion.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**9-26**]): IMPRESSION: Large parenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding vasogenic edema, centered in the right basal
ganglia, but extending into the medial temporal lobe, not much
changed in size, configuration or degree of mass effect, with
effacement of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle, since the CT of
some 17.5 hours earlier. Of note, there is no evidence of
"microhemorrhage" elsewhere to specifically suggest underlying
amyloid or hypertensive angiopathy, and no pathologic
enhancement in or around the lesion, to suggest an underlying
mass or other structural abnormality; however, the FLAIR images
do demonstrate bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular and
central pontine white matter
abnormalities, seen in chronic microvascular disease from
hypertension, which may be the underlying etiology of the bleed.


ECG ([**9-28**]): Irregular tachy-arrhythmia at a rate of 143 of
uncertain mechanism but may be atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response. Right bundle-branch block. ST-T wave
changes are probably primary and are not specific.

ECG ([**9-28**]): Atrial
