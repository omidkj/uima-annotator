History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 25582**] is a 64 year old female with history of mitral
valve endocarditis in [**2128-3-17**]. She was diagnosed with mitral
regurgitation at that time. Since then, she has been
experiencing progressive shortness of breath and lower extremity
edema. She denies chest pain, orthopnea, PND, palpitations and
syncope. A cardiac catheterization in [**2131-8-18**] confirmed
severe mitral regurgitation. She had normal coronary arteries.
Findings were also notable for moderate to severe pulmonary
hypertension. Based on the above results, she was referred for
cardiac surgical intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 25582**] was admitted on [**10-31**] and underwent a
mitral valve replacment with a pericardial thermafix valve. The
operation was uneventful and she was brought CSRU on minimal
inotropic support. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. She weaned from pressort support
without difficulty. By postoperative day one, she experienced
oliguria and developed acute respiratory distress which required
reintubation. The renal service was consulted and recommended to
hold cyclosporine and continue Lasix trials. Her creatinine
peaked to 3.9. Her acute on chronic renal failure was attributed
to acute tubular necrosis. K+ levels remained within normal
limits and there was no inidication to proceed with
hemodialysis. Over the next several days, she gradually
responded to Lasix drip. By postoperative day three, she was
re-extubated. She was concomitantly started on Amiodarone for
paroxsymal atrial fibrillation. She otherwise maintained stable
hemodynamics and remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm. She
was gradually transitioned to oral Lasix and transferred to the
SDU on postoperative day five. Due to poor IV access, the
central venous line was left in place and changed appropriately.
She continued to remain mostly in a normal sinus rhythm,
tolerating beta blockade and Amiodarone. Her renal function
continued to improve. Cyclosporine was eventually continued on
postooperative day 7.
She continued to make clinical improvements and was cleared for
discharge on postoperative day 10. At discharge, her oxygen
saturations were 95% with the chest x-ray showing ****. Her
heart rate was in sinus rhythm and blood pressure was well
controlled. All surgical wounds were clean, dry and intact.
