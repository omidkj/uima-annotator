REPORTS AND STUDIES
[**2200-2-4**]
Findings:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:   Mucosa: Mild erythema of the mucosa compatible with
gastritis was noted in the antrum. The antral mucosal folds were
also somewhat prominent, though benign in appearance.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Mild gastritis
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Follow HCT
Continue PPI
If the patient shows signs of continued bleeding would consider
colonoscopy and possible capsule study
Additional notes: The findings on EGD do not explain the
patient's melena.
The procedure was done by the attending and GI Fellow.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Anemia/black stools:
The patient was found to be anemic upon arrival into the ED at
21.8, down fom his discharge hematocrit of 23.2 from [**2200-1-28**],
and was guaiac positive on rectal exam. He remained
hemodynamically stable.

Serial Admit HCTS 21.78 --> 1unit pRBC --> 21.2 -> 1unit pRBC ->
24.3, and remained stable for 24hours. He had an upper EGD which
showed mild gastritis but was otherwise unremarkable. A
colonoscopy was recommended as an outpatient.

# Atrial Fibrillation / Anticoagulation
The patient was admitted on coumadin with goal 2.0-2.5 for INR,
but it was unclear to us if he was on coumadin for AFib or for
his recent bioprosthetic valves. The matter was discussed with
cardiothoracic surgery, who noted that the patient did not
require anticoagulation for the valves as it was not standard of
practice here. The coumadin was held, and the patient instructed
to discuss the risks/benefits with his PCP.


# Respiratory:
Patient is trached and PEG'd s/p his recent extensive cardiac
surgery. Current regimen at rehab is to be on TCM 40% during the
day and AC at 500x10, PEEP 5, FiO2 40% at night. Patient was
fully off the vent at time of last discharge, but he was
restarted on the vent at night. His usual evening ambien and
clonazepam were quite sedating for the patient, and this was
felt to be the cause of his need for assist control ventillation
at rehab. We recommend that sedatives be minimized and that he
be weaned from needed AC/Ventilator Support at night.

# Hypernatremia:
The patient's sodium was 145 on admission, and rose to 152 the
morning of discharge, likely in context of being NPO. His free
water boluses were increased in his tube feeds. On recheck at
9am of day of discharge, his sodium was 148. He should continue
to receive free water boluses of 250cc every 4 hours. Lasix is
being held. His chemistries should be checked daily for the next
two days.

# congenital heart disease:
s/p recent surgery. No CAD on cath in [**12-10**].
Metoprolol was to resume on discharge.

# h/o peptostreptococcus bacteremia
The patient completed a 14 day course in total, and was
discharged off of vancomycin.

# Anxiety/depression: continued home meds (fluoxetine, klonopin)

.
# DM/glucose control: Continued home insulin regimen - half-dose
glargine while NPO. FS QID.
.
# FEN: Patient is NPO and gets tube feeds at baseline. His tube
feeds were restarted.
.
# Access: PICC, PIV.
.
# PPX: IV PPI was changed to home lansoprazole for discharge.
Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
.
# Code: full
