Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute Choleystitis: Upon entering the medical center, she was
actually sent with no laboratories. Repeating her laboratories
to check on evaluation, she became progressively septic. She ahd
an ultrasound, which confirmed small stones and sludge, but a
small gallbladder. Because of her cardiac condition and because
of the impending sepsis, it was thought perhaps percutaneous
cholecystostomy would be appropriate, however, interventional
radiology refused to do that, because of the size of the
gallbladder. Therefore she was brought immediately to surgery
very early on [**2103-12-9**] where we did an open cholecystectomy and
operative cholangiography. The common bile duct was noted to be
enlarged at surgery, however, on doing cholangiograms, she had
free flow of bile into the duodenum. She had multiple small
stones, however, and it is speculated that perhaps one of these
small stones had passed and actually managed to occlude the
common duct. Subsequently, the laboratory came back revealing
that her liver enzymes were all normal preop, but nonetheless,
the common bile duct size was clearly abnormal and therefore the
cholangiograms were necessary. However, the cholangiograms did
show free flow into the duodenum without filling defects.
She was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics. Intra-operative
cultures from the gall bladder later grew pansensitive E. Coli
and she remained on Levoquin.  She was to finish a 14-day
course.

# Peri-operative myocardial infarction: Prior to surgery she was
evaluated by cardiology given her significant cardiac history.
She was considered high risk for for a peri-op event, but little
could be done to decrease her risk. Emergent cath was not
recommended given the failed attempt for RCA PCI on [**2103-11-29**].

From the OR the patient remained intubated and was transfered to
the SICU. Post-op the patient cardiac enzymes were noted to be
elevated. Cardiology continue to follow and the patient remained
the in SICU.  The acute myocardial infarction was thought to be
demand ischemia.  A Swan cathether was placed on [**2103-12-10**] for
improved monitoring especially given her rising cardiac enzymes
and her oliguria.  An Echo was obtained on [**2103-12-11**] showing
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Per cardiology her home beta blockers were continued.  Lipitor
was started and her home ASA resumed.

# Acute Renal Failure: [**2103-12-10**] The patient became oliguric with
an acutely rising creatinine.  She was agressively fluid
resucciated.  Over the next day the oliguria improved.  Her
creatinine returned to baseline by the end of her hospital stay.
.
On [**2103-12-12**] she was transfered to the floor from the SICU. She
was started on clears [**2103-12-14**] which was advanced to regular on
[**2103-12-15**].  Her JP was removed on [**2103-12-15**]. Upon discharge she
was tolerating a regular diet, had good pain control with PO
pain medications, was ambulating with assistance, and her renal
function was normal.
