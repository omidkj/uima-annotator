CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted for potential kidney transplant.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 42-year-old female
with end-stage renal disease secondary to P-ANCA
glomerulonephritis currently getting hemodialysis on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday via right upper extremity AV fistula.
She had a previous kidney transplant in [**2109**] which failed
approximately 1.5 years posttransplant. She does not void and
has high sensitization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Vasculitis secondary to P-ANCA, status
post partial parathyroidectomy in [**2103**] at [**Hospital6 **], history of pericarditis, perirectal abscess, GI
bleed, Afib resolved, chronic renal failure x15 years, AV
fistula graft.

ALLERGIES:  PCN and amoxicillin, codeine.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Calcium 600 p.o. q.i.d., Nephrocaps 1
daily, calcitriol 0.25 mg p.o. daily, Tylenol p.r.n., and
Benadryl p.r.n.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was preop'd and received
plasmapheresis. Pretransplant for high sensitization.
Nephrology was consulted and followed throughout this
hospital course. She was taken to the OR on [**2118-1-29**]. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. She received a cadaveric
renal transplant. She received induction immunosuppression
per protocol. The kidney perfused well and made urine
immediately.

Posttransplant, she received IV IG, ATG, Solu-Medrol, and
CellCept per protocol. She received plasmapheresis and
rituximab. Plan was to complete 5 plasmapheresis treatments
posttransplant. She developed hematuria. A renal ultrasound
demonstrated no hydronephrosis, fluid collections, or stones.

Initially, urine output was low averaging about 30 cc per
hour. Urine output slowly increased to approximately 1,200 cc
per day. She continued to receive plasmapheresis. Prograf was
started at 7 mg p.o. b.i.d. Creatinine decreased to 5.7.
Creatinine continued to trend down to 3.7. She continued on
plasmapheresis, receiving IV calcium gluconate for
hypocalcemia. Her hematocrit trended down to 22. She was
transfused.

On postop day 7, renal function stabilized with a creatinine
of 3.7. She underwent a renal biopsy without difficulty under
ultrasound guidance. Biopsy report demonstrated acute
antibody-mediated humeral rejection type I. A repeat duplex
demonstrated slight increase in resistive indices. No
hydronephrosis was noted. The heterogeneous collection
lateral to the transplanted kidney was consistent with
hematoma measuring 10 x 9.8 x 9.6 cm. She continued on
plasmapheresis.

On postop day 9, she developed pain over the incision. A firm
and distended area was noted along the incision. She started
to have some bleeding from the incision. A Foley was inserted
and a hematocrit was sent off STAT. This hematocrit was 22.1.

Her incision was opened at the bedside for approximately 75
cc of clot. A wound VAC was placed, and she was again,
transfused and started on Epogen.

On [**2117-2-7**], a CT of the abdomen and pelvis was done.
This demonstrated a large hematoma in the subcutaneous
tissues underneath the right flank incision. No evidence of
intraabdominal hematoma was noted. No evidence of
hydronephrosis or hematoma compressing the kidney transplant
was noted.

On [**2117-2-8**], she was transferred to the SICU for
closer monitoring for decreased hematocrit. She was
transfused and continued on plasmapheresis. Acute renal
failure was felt to be secondary to pyelonephritis. She was
started on Levaquin. A urine culture demonstrated ...

INCOMPLETE REPORT. DICTATOR WAS CUT OFF.
