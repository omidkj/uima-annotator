HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Intensive Care Unit and was transfused 6 units of packed red
blood cells.  The patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
done which showed a duodenal ulcer with visible vessel which
was injected and cauterized.  The patient was then
transferred to the floor for further monitoring.  The patient
was also started on an intravenous Protonix drip.

1.  Gastrointestinal - The patient's hematocrit remained
stable at 33, post 6 unit transfusion.  The patient's
Protonix drip was discontinued and the patient was placed on
Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  An Helicobacter pylori antibody
was sent which was found to be positive.  The patient will be
started on Clarithromycin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. times 14 days
and Amoxicillin 1 gm p.o. b.i.d. times 14 days in addition to
Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. times 14 days and then 40 mg p.o.
q. day.  The patient's diet was advanced to full liquids
which he has tolerated by far.  The patient will be advanced
to full diet within the next 24 hours and if he is able to
tolerate that should be discharged.

Cough - On arrival to the floor it was noted that the patient
had cough productive of sputum and a white count of 21.  PA
and lateral was done which showed congestive heart failure,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-emphysema and although
officially did not read any infiltrates, there was a
questionable retrocardiac infiltrate on examination.  The
patient was started on intravenous Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin since he was unable to tolerate p.o. at the
time.  The patient will be switched to a p.o. regimen upon
discharge.  On the second day on the floor the patient's
white count had decreased from 21 to 17 and cough appeared
slightly better than before.

In terms of the patient's congestive heart failure,
maintenance intravenous fluids were discontinued and the
patient will be repleted as needed.  The patient was not
actively diuresed since he had a recent large
gastrointestinal bleed.  He will continue to be monitored
during this hospitalization.  The patient's oxygen saturation
on room air is 97%.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was found to
be hypokalemic with a potassium of 2.9 on hospital day #3.
The patient was repleted, although it is not clear why he is
still hypokalemic at this time.  We will continue to monitor.
The patient will have a more advanced diet by the time of
discharge.

Access - The patient has two large bore intravenous lines.
The patient was placed on aspiration and fall precautions due
to his mental status.  It appears at baseline, however, he
has difficulty talking and has confusion at baseline due to
his supranuclear palsy.  The patient was evaluated by
Physical Therapy who felt that the patient would benefit from
inpatient rehabilitation at another facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Peptic ulcer disease, most likely secondary to
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and positive
Helicobacter pylori, complicated by anemia and hemodynamic
instability.
2.  Bronchitis versus pneumonia.
3.  Supranuclear palsy
4.  Meniere's disease
5.  Status post cerebrovascular accident times two

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. times 14 days and then 40 mg p.o.
q. day
Clarithromycin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. times 14 days
Amoxicillin 1 gm p.o. b.i.d. times 14 days

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation for further physical therapy treatment.  The
patient should have a regular diet but should observe
aspiration precautions.  The patient should follow up with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one to two weeks.
