Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension post PCI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
crdiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the left
anterior descending coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
58 yo male with CAD (s/p AMI [**10/2100**]) presenting with
hypotension to the 60s-70s s/p cath today with DES. He has an
extensive past cardiac history and received a proximal LAD
DE-cypher stent in [**10/2100**] and 3 BMS to the circumflex in
[**11/2100**], DM, HTN, HL, infarct-related cardiomyopathy ([**2-3**] TTE:
EF of 30%, s/p ICD [**2-/2101**]) and presenetd for cardiac
catheterisation following recurrent R-sided chest pains similar
to previous anginal chest pains.

He had noted recurrent chest pains occurring several times per
week over the past few weeks on a background of angina over the
past 2 years. His pains are R chest dull aches that radiated to
the right shoulder  lastimg 3-4 mins and often occurred after
eating but could also occur at rest and were not associated with
nausea, vomiting or light-headedness but had mild sweating. He
saw a cardiologist 3-4 months ago regarding his chest pains who
commenced ISMN which helped and referred him for cath.

He underwent cath on [**8-11**] and found to have 100% proximal RCA
with left to right and right to right collaterals. LAD with 90%
in stent restenosis proximally and underwent a DES to the ostial
LAD. LCx stents were patent. Cardiac Index 1.68 l/min/m2, RAP
mean 12, PCWP Mean 27, PAP 59/29/42, AoP 131/89. Patient
underwent cath without any immediate complications.
.
Upon making several attempts at a bowel movement in the
bathroom, the patient was walking back to his bed and developed
lightheadedness. His blood pressure was as low as 60/40mm Hg
with a HR of c60s. He felt confused and presyncopal but never
lost consciousness. He denied chest pain/sob/palpitations. EKG
showed no new changes. He was given a 1 liter bolus of NS and
his blood pressure slowly increased to 90/50. Patient was
mentating well and it was unclear if he was urinating. Given his
hypotension unresponsive to fluids and marked nursing concern,
he was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring. On
transfer, SBP 90mmHg, pulsus was 6-8 mmHg and there was no
significant difference in arm BPs. On arrival to the CCU, he was
completely asymptomatic.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denied recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, or syncope. Presyncopal symptoms as
above.

circumflex in
[**11/2100**]), DM, HTN, HL, infarct-related cardiomyopathy ([**2-3**] TTE:
EF of
30%, s/p ICD [**2-/2101**]) who presents with R-sided chest pain
similar to
previo us anginal chest pains.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
chest pain - anginal equivalent

PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French left [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
