Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo male with multiple medical problems including advanced
dementia (baseline A&OX1), with rapid decline x 6 months,
admitted [**8-30**] with MS changes, tachpnea/resp distress: Found to
have PNA, agitated, UGIB and hgb drop to 4.3, EGD unrevealing.
treated with broad spectrum Abx X10days for possible aspiration
PNA. Transfered to Gen med, MS did not improved, remained
minimally responsive except for clear pain with position
changes, dressing changes of necrotic LE wounds. Nutrition was
an issue as he was not able to take anything PO. After many
attempts DHT finally placed for nutrition, but pt eventually
pulled it out.  Poor candidate for many reasons for PEG tube and
wife [**Company 191**] agreed to forgoe PEG placement and other heroic
measures which are unlikely to benefit the patient. Finally made
DNR/I 9/30 per discussion with wife, who is HCP,  despite
resistance from other family members whose expectations have
overall been unrealistic. Goals of care were redirected to
comfort measures/hospice with main focus pain control. he was
managed on fentanyl patch with prn roxanol and levsin for oral
secretions.  Given that death was expected over next few days,
he was kept in the hospital over the weekend. On saturday, pt's
breathing became irregular with apenic episodes. Family was
notified and questions answered, support given (seem my OMR note
the time declared the patient and filled out paperwork. Family
interested in autopsy and request is submitted.
