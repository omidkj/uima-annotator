Patient is a 36yo female with history of DM and depression,
admitted with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.

movements since her symptoms arose but denies any dark/red
stool.  Of note, the patient ate lobster on Saturday.  Reports

contacts.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**5-/2105**] with a
similar presentation of GI symptoms.  She was not in DKA during
this hospitalization.  She underwent EGD during that stay which
demonstrated no gastritis/esophagitis.  Biopsies consistent with
mild chronic inflammation.
.
Her diabetic history is unclear- she has been labeled as a type
1 and type 2 diabetic.  She had actually not been on any therapy
for about 8 months until she was admitted with similar symptoms
in 5/[**2105**].  On discharge, she was started on lantus and regular
insulin sliding scale.  The patient says that she has not been
compliant with her insulin in the last 5 days.  The patient
report Last A1C- 11.1 in 5/[**2105**].
.
Given her persistent nausea and blood in vomitus, the patient
presented to her PCP's office where she was found to have a
blood sugar of 473.  She was sent to the ED for further
management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T- 96, P- 127, BP- 143/99, R- 18,
SaO2 100% on RA.  Labs showed an anion gap acidosis with
ketonuria consistent with DKA.  Patient was started on an
insulin gtt at 6U/hr and given 2L NS for hydration.  Patient's
symptoms improved with zofran and ativan.  She remained stable
in the ED.  She is being admitted to the ICU for management of
DKA.

Brief Hospital Course:
Diabetic [**Name (NI) 58218**]  Unclear precipitant.  Most likely
infectious etiology (GI).  Patient carries diagnosis of type 1
DM but apparently recently went 8 months without any therapy
whatsoever, which is usually not tolerated in type 1 DM. On
admission her sugars of 490 with ketonuria of 150 and glucosuria
of 1000 were consistent with DKA vs HSS.  The patient was
aggressively rehydrated wnd placed on an insulin drip over
night.  Her electrolytes were followed every two hours and
potassium was repleted as needed.  By morning her anion gap had
closed and she was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin with her
sugars stable in the upper 100s to low 200s on sliding scale
correction.  [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes was consulted who followed the
patient during her ICU stay.  Patient was transferred to CC7 on
[**7-3**] and glucose remained stable until discharge.
.
Nausea- The patient was persistently nauseous throughout her
stay and was unable to eat.  Reglan was started on [**7-1**] and the
patient's reported abdominal pain and nausea were much improved.
 This persistent nausea requiring now two admissions is
concerning for gastroparesis in the setting of uncontrolled
diabetes.  A gastric emptying study was ordered for the pt to
investigate gastroparesis vs gastric infectious etiology that
was questioned given elevated WBC.  It was decided to pursue
this outpatient.  Nausea was not present at time of discharge on
[**2105-7-3**].
.
Hematemesis- Patient found to have specks of black substance in
vomitus.  She had recent admission for GI bleed in [**5-/2105**] where
an EGD showed an area consistent with mild chronic inflammation.
 No gastritis or esophagitis were identified.  The hematemesis
was most likely secondary to the patients wretching.  The pts
hct was trended throughout the patients stay.  She was found to
be H Pylori negative.  Patient noted that she has a history of
acid reflux and was written a prescription for omeprazole.
.
HTN- The patients lisinopril was initially held in the setting
of nausea and vomiting.  It was restarted on [**7-2**] when the
patient could eat.
.
Anxiety- Patient was given PRN dose of Ativan based on home
medications.
.
Diabetes mellitus- patient was followed throughout stay by
[**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center.  Follow-up appointments were made with
them, as well as an ophthalmologist for annual eye checks.
