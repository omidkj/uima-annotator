changes. Upon EMS arrival, she was tachypneaic to 40,
tachycardic to 170s , disoriented, and hypertensive to 200s.  In
EW, code sepsis called, RIJ placed. She was given
levo/flagyl(for fever and luekocytosis). Her intial vitals were
T103, P133 BP176/50 RR23. Her initial lactate was 6.5 which
decreased to 1.6 with hydration.

Physical Exam:

Gen: frail
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, poor dentition
Neck: s/p IJ placement
Chest: dimished effort, rhonchorous
CV: hyperdynamic PMI, distant S1 s2, no mrg
Abd: obese tender diffusey, no rebound
Ext: no edema
Neuro: oriented to person and place

Pertinent Results:
Admission labs significant for WBC of 18, AST 58, ALT 46 AP 118,
lactate 6.8.

CT abdomen: CBD dilitation

ERCP: difficult cannulation prequiring precut sphincterotomy for
CBD acces. Biliary dilation with distal CBD stricture suggestive
of neoplasm. Cytology obtained.

EKG: on third day of admission showed lateral EKG changes and
cardiac enzymes revealed NSTEMI. Troponin I peaked at 0.37. At
the time of discharge had returned to baseline.

CTA abdomen: no mass in the pancreas, but pt does have L kidney
mass and L renal vein thrombus

Brief Hospital Course:
89yo F with COPD/emphysema, chronic back pain who presented s/p
fall with altered mental status found to have cholangitis and
NSTEMI.  While hospitalized CTA of abdomen revealed L kidney
mass suspicious for renal cancer.
#ID: Cholangitis: patient underwent ERCP and sphincterotomy and
stent placement in CBD. She will complete a 21 day course of
antibiotics. At the time of discharge she has 10 additional days
of antibiotics (levofloxacin and flagyl) left.
#Renal mass: CT scan to evaluate possible pancreatic mass found
on ERCP found that pt did not have pancreatic mass, but was
found to have L renal mass and renal vein thrombus.  Pt was
started on low dose coumadin.  She should have her INR checked
on [**4-26**] with results faxed to her primary care physcian.
She has an appointment for an MRI of the kidneys [**5-6**] at
[**Hospital3 **].  She was evaluated by urology and will be seen by
them in followup.  The implications of this mass was discussed
with the patient and her daughter.
#CAD: NSTEMI: Pt ruled in for MI, enzyme peak at 0.37, EKG
diffuse lateral ST depression, cardiac enzymes have trended down
to baseline.  Pt was started on aspirin and had 48 hours of
heparin.  Echocardiogram showed EF 60%, mild-mod TR, mod PA HTN.
Pt will need outpatient p-MIBI for risk stratification,
especially if she decides to pursue treatment of renal mass.
#COPD/emphysema: Pt received stress dose steroids while in the
ICU, she was then tapered down to home dose of prednisone and
remains on her regular inhalers.
#HTN-
- Continue metoprolol and captopril
#chronic low back pain
- tylenol, morphine prn with aggressive bowel regimen
