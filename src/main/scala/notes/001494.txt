[**2147-1-24**] CT Head
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

2. Air-fluid level within the left maxillary sinus without
definitive
fracture detected. Findings likely reflect sinusitis.


[**2147-1-24**] CT C-spine
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute fracture or traumatic malalignment.

2. Multilevel cervical stenosis secondary to degenerative
change. If there
is clinical concern for myelopathy, MRI of the cervical spine is
recommended
for further evaluation to evaluate for cord edema/injury.

3. Tiny left apical pneumothorax with subcutaneous emphysema.

4. Soft tissue opacity within the right lung apex is
non-specific, possibly
reflecting scar and is little changed since [**2145-12-28**].

[**2147-1-24**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Numerous left-sided acute rib fractures causing small left
hemopneumothorax and atelectasis. Significant subcutaneous
emphysema noted.
2. Significantly enlarged prostate gland.
3. Moderate-to-severe coronary artery calcifications and
moderate
calcification of the aortic valve of unknown hemodynamic
significance.
4. Possible mild reaction to IV contrast material as detailed in
technique
portion of the report.

[**2147-1-28**] Chest xray
FINDINGS:

Multiple left rib fractures are again noted, and there is
evidence of left
pleural fluid and atelectasis. Retrocardiac density is not
significantly
different. There is no PTX.





Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service and transferred to the
Trauma ICU for close monitoring of his respiratory status
because of his injuries. The Pain Service was consulted for
epidural analgesia; it was decided to place a paravertebral
catheter which remained in place for several days. He was also
started on PCA Dilaudid initially and was then changed oral
narcotics but became disoriented with the narcotics. A short
trial of Ultram was started and then discontinued as his
disorientation did not improve initially. Once off of all
narcotics and the Ultram his mental status improved
significantly. Geriatrics was also consulted and made several
recommendations regarding his pain medications. His current pain
regimen includes Tylenol 1 gram around the clock and Lidocaine
5% patch.

He still requires supplemental nasal oxygen as he does
desaturate on room air to low 90's high 80's. Most recent chest
xray does show some pleural fluid and atelectasis, bu no
pneumothorax. He is able to illicit a fairly strong productive
cough with encouragement.

On hospital day 5 he self discontinued his Foley catheter with
the balloon inflated and was noted to have hematuria following
this. A 3 way catheter was attempted without success and so a
one way Foley was replaced. He is ordered for q shift catheter
flushes with sterile water. The hematuria has decreased
significantly; the catheter can be removed in the next day or so
as long as the hematuria has resolved.

Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have
recommended acute level rehab after his hospital stay.
