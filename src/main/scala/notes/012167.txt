Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial flutter

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
atrial flutter ablation
transesophageal echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM,
HTN, who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further
management of atrial flutter and possible
ablation/cardioversion. The patient reports that for
approximately two weeks prior to admission at the OSH he was
experiencing chest pains, dyspnea on exertion, insomnia,
fatigue, and cold sweats. On [**6-4**] his dyspnea got worse to the
point where he could not even get out of bed and walk across the
room without getting severely short of breath and light-headed,
so he asked his son to take him to the hospital. Initially, an
EKG revealed atrial fibrillation with RVR in 170s so he was
started on IV diltiazem. His rate fell to 150s and rhythm
switched to atrial flutter. Reportedly, his blood pressure also
fell with the diltiazem so he was switched to PO verapamil, IV
digoxin, and amiodarone, but he remained in afib/aflutter and
tachycardia. Because his rate could not be successfully
controlled, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
cardioversion.
.
In terms of his dyspnea, he had a CXR at the OSH showing
??????cardiomegaly with right lung base airspace opacity compatible
with atelectasis and/or infiltrates.?????? He also had an ABG that
showed 7.17/100/81. The OSH physicians felt the etiology was CHF
secondary to afib, so he was started on a lasix drip. He
diuresed well, his dyspnea markedly improved, and repeat ABG on
[**6-6**] was 7.34/67/60 on 1.5L NC.
.
Upon arriving at the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, the patient actually got out of
the EMS gurney and walked over to his CCU bed. He was stable
hemodynamically with HR in 80-110s and SBPs in 110s.

Studies:
.
EKG: Atrial flutter with variable block. Atrial rate
approximately 300, ventricular rate approximately 100-105. Left
anterior hemiblock/right bundle-branch block. Generalized
non-specific repolarization changes. No previous tracing
available for comparison.
.
TRANS-ESOPHAGEAL ECHO:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the incisors. The aortic
valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of atrial thrombus. Bicuspid aortic
valve with mild aortic regurgitation. Mildly depressed left
ventricular function. RV function appears depressed.


Brief Hospital Course:
56yo man w hx of DMII, hyperlipidemia, morbid obesity, HTN who
came in from OSH with suspected aflutter and hypoventilation now
s/p tee and aflutter ablation, now in normal sinus rhythm.

Aflutter: The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] after a two-day
stay at [**Hospital3 **] where he had atrial flutter that failed
medical therapy. Upon admission, EKG showed persistent atrial
flutter with rates in the 150s. He was given diltiazem IV bolus
x2 over the first night which brought his rate down to the
110-120s. He was also started on Coumadin 5 mg po qd and a
heparin sliding scale to bridge to a goal INR 2.0-3.0. On
hospital day 2, the patient underwent TEE that showed no
evidence of intracardiac clot, so we proceeded with ablation.
After the procedure, the patient maintained normal sinus rhythm
with rates in the 80-90s. He was finally restarted on his home
dose of lisinopril 5 mg po qd, and started on a metoprolol and
digoxin for rate control. Upon discharge, the patient was in
normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 95 and BP of 121/69. He was
discharged on Coumadin, which he should continue until [**2198-7-9**]
(or longer, as determined by his primary cardiologist) in order
to prevent peri-ablation thromboembolism. Scheduled for PCP
followup on [**6-13**] to follow up on INR lab draw on [**6-12**], with goal
INR [**2-20**].

Pump: EF from OSH depressed likely [**2-19**] tachycardia induced
cardiomyopathy. To treat his fluid overload, the patient
received lasix 40 mg iv bolus x2 and diuresed well, with a fluid
balance that was net negative 7L during his complete length of
stay.
During his stay he maintained O2 sats in the 88-92% range but
required up to 4L by nasal canula. By the end he was weaned down
to room air and had an ambulatory O2 sat of 88% on room air.
.
Hypoventilation: likely [**2-19**] cardiomyopathy w increased pulm
vascular congestion and with hx of tobb use/suspected COPD.
Given nebs and steroids at OSH, not required here.
.
DMII: HISS.  Initially held lisinopril to allow rate control,
then restarted by discharge on home dose of lisinopril 5mg PO
daily
.
Hyperlipidemia: Continued home zetia.  Apparently unable to
tolerate statins
.
Morbid obesity: likely w OSA.  Recommend outpatient sleep study
eval prn.
