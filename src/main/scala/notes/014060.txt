Date of Birth:  [**2131-2-15**]             Sex:   M

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
indigestion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
percutaneous coronary intervention ([**9-19**])


COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed mild
LMCA
disease.  The LAD was totally occluded after the second diagonal
which had a 70% lesion.  The LCX had a 90% lesion distal to OM1.
 OM1 was subtotally occluded proximally.  It was not clear if
this represented a collateral or the subtotally occluded parent
vessel.  Given how easily the wire crossed it is likely the
latter.
2.  Succesful intervention on the LCX with a 3x18mm Vision
post-dilated to 3.0mm and intervention on OM 1 with a 3.0x28mm
Vision stent.  Final angiography revealed no dissection and TIMI
3 flow. See PTCA comments.
3.  Limited hemodynamics revealed blood pressure of 155/100 with
HR 69 in sinus rhythm.  The patient did have a vagal episode at
the start of case with BP down to 83/55 in the setting of
getting IV nitro 20mcg. This was treated successfully with
atropine and IVF.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease per diagnostic cath at
OSH
2. Successful intervention on LCX and OM1 with bare metal
stents.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65 year-old male with a history of MI, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, Type-2 DM, s/p CABGx4 in [**2186**], who presented on
[**9-14**] with "indigestion", increasing nausea, and DOE.  This
indigestion was the same as the feeling he had during his MI in
[**2181**].  He presented to OSH, where a dobutamine stress test
resulted in  VT/VF arrest.  He received defibrillation x2 and
amiodarone bolus, returning to NSR.  Cardiac cath at OSH showed
severe native 3 vessel disease  with occluded SVG-OM1, OM2 and
RCA, along with a patent SVG-LAD and an EF of 35%.

The patient was transfered directly to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
intervention.  He received 2 BMS to the LCx and was brought up
to the floor for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. CAD: The patient's post-catheterization check and labs were
all unremarkable.  He was continued on ASA, plavix, statin,
metoprolol, amlodipine.
.
#. Pump: LVEF 45%.
.
#. Rhythm: NSR. Continued on Amiodarone 400mg PO DAILY, tele was
negative.  Given the patient's Vfib on Dobutamine, EP was
consulted for possible ICD placement.  They determined that an
ICD was not necessary at the time and recommended d/c'ing the
Amiodarone.
.
# HTN: Patient was continued on metoprolol and amlodipine.
Valsartan 40mg PO DAILY was added.  Pt's SBP persistently in
140s-150s.  Pt restarted on HCTZ for discharge.
.
DM2 - Patient with longstanding DM2.  His home meds were held
and he was placed on a sliding scale, but Bglucose was to 300s.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended Lantus 15 units qdinner
with sliding scale.  Pt had teaching regarding insulin
injections, fingersticks, sliding scales.  Will f/u as
outpatient with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] to get endocrinologist to follow him
back in [**Location (un) 5450**], NH.
.
#Hypothyroidism: Longstanding, the patient was continued on
levoxyl.  His TSH returned elevated at 5.2, likely secondary to
affects of Amiodarone.  Amiodarone was d/c'd, Pt to f/u with
PCP.
.
#Hyperlipidemia: Longstanding, the patient was continued on his
statin, ezetimibe.
.

#. Prophylaxis: Patient given Heparin 5000 units SC TID.  He was
continued on his home Protonix 40mg PO DAILY
