Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
right shoulder twitching, altered
mentation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a recent history of
frequent seizures with right face and shoulder twitching who
returns to [**Hospital1 18**] with reports of altered mentation and
recurrence
of right shoulder twitches.

Her history from her recent admission is as follows: on [**2108-2-18**]
she was found down at her residence and was noted to be
bradycardic, hypotensive, hypothermic, and lethargic. She was
transported to an ED at Upstate [**Location (un) **] Hospital in NY where
she had a cardiopulmonary arrest and was intubated and
resuscitated. The intubation was difficult and she was found to
have a mediastinal mass (multinodular goiter with papillary
microcarcinoma, which was removed). She had a complicated
hospital course with hospital-associated pneumonia, lung
collapse
s/p bronchoscopy, sepsis, corneal abrasion/chemosis,
perioperative anemia from blood loss, and then confusion. She
was
started on quetiapine initially for suspected ICU-related
delirium. However, she started showing clinical signs of
seizures
(sudden behavioral arrest, blank stare, eye deviation to the
left
and down) which resolved with low dose of lorazepam. Despite
reportedly unremarkable head imaging, she was thought to
potentially has PRES (unclear what the blood pressure
measurements were at the time). She was started on Levetiracetam
750 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention. An EEG done at that time
reportedly suggested potential epileptiform foci but no seizures
were seen. She was discharged to a rehab but per her family did
not return to her prior highly functional baseline mental
status.
On [**2108-3-21**], she was even more lethargic than usual and did not
respond promptly to sternal rub. She was observed as having
right
face and right shoulder twitches with associated bowel/bladder
incontinence which ceased with diazepam 2.5 mg given twice. She
had a normal blood sugar of 81 at that time and otherwise normal
vital signs after the episode. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **]
for further management where she was given two loading doses of
Fosphenytoin 500 mg with some improvement in the focal motor
activity. Neurology was consulted there and recommended
increasing Levetiracetam to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and continuing
Phenytoin.
She had an unremarkable NCHCT. She was found to have a UTI and
was started on Ceftriaxone on [**3-21**]. She was thought to
potentially have pneumonia as well, but chest imaging did not
reveal an infiltrate so this was stopped. An EEG was obtained
which potentially showed frequent left parasagittal epileptiform
discharges, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Upon arrival, her mental status was already improving, so
further
changes to medications were not made at that time. Her EEG
showed
frequent GPEDS and PLEDs. She continue to improve in mental
status, eventually was transitioned to a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] again
(Levetiracetam 1000 [**Hospital1 **]), and was sent to [**Hospital 38**] Rehab in
stable condition.

MICRO data:
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
      Further incubation required to determine the presence or
absence of
      commensal respiratory flora.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH.

[**4-8**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Single portable frontal chest x-ray demonstrates no
acute
intrathoracic process. Blunting of the costophrenic angles with
fluid seen in the minor fissure represents trace bilateral
pleural effusions which are unchanged from prior study. The
cardiac silhouette is enlarged with stable left ventricular
predominance. Calcifications are again noted within the aortic
arch, as are clips within the left neck. There is no
pneumothorax.  There are no suspicious osseous lesions.
IMPRESSION: Probable tiny bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged
from prior.  No acute intrathoracic process.

[**4-9**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-8**] at 4:21 p.m.:
New endotracheal tu
