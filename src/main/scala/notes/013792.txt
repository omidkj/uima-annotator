ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Aphasia.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Malignant hypertension/Confusion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old right
handed male who presented on the morning of [**2198-2-5**].
Around 8 a.m. he was last well, when his wife saw him next
around 9:30 in the morning, he did not answer any questions
and barely responded with a shrug of his shoulders.  He did
not have any obvious weakness and was able to walk normally
in the house.  His wife called emergency medical services,
who noted the patient was "staring."  EMS arrived around
11:57 in the morning and found a lack of speech as well as an
inability to follow commands.  When the patient was asked
about this, patient says he "can't speak like he used to."

He denies headache, visual changes, weakness, or numbness.
The wife reports he was not complaining of headache or any
visual changes.  He did not have any fever or recent
illnesses at home.  He denies any recent head trauma.  He has
had no recent cold sores or exposure to people with cold
sores.

His initial blood pressure at presentation was greater than
systolics of 260s over diastolics of 120s.  He initially
required intravenous Labetalol to decrease it.  Initial chest
x-ray showed a possible retrocardiac opacity suspicious for
pneumonia.  Patient was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
His cardiac enzymes have been negative.  His clinical exam
has rapidly improved.

On the day following admission the patient reports seeing
kids at the bedside but knows that they were not there.  When
he asked his wife about this, she also says that they were
not there consistent with a possible visual hallucination.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Colon cancer status post radiation therapy and
chemotherapy with recurrence in [**2188**] with resection and a
colostomy.
4.  End-stage renal disease and is on dialysis, hemodialysis
specifically.
5.  Mitral regurgitation.
6.  Congestive heart failure.
7.  Left retinal hemorrhage in [**2196**].
8.  Cholecystectomy in [**2186**] for gallstone pancreatitis.
9.  Known left temporal meningioma.
10. Generalized tonic-clonic seizure six years ago after
dialysis.

He has no history of stroke, myocardial infarction, or high
cholesterol.

Further details of his admit physical and neurological exams,
please see admit notes.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 74-year-old male who had a
short episode of language difficulties that rapidly improved.
No clear diagnosis has been detected.  His MRI and MRA were
unremarkable except for the appearance of the left temporal
meningioma.  He is left handed so is not certain which side
his language center is on.

He also had a very high blood pressure when he first came in.
Perhaps he has a hypertensive encephalopathy, although he
rapidly improved and his MRI did not show any sort of
posterior leukoencephalopathy.  Another possibility would be
a seizure or transient ischemic attack.  This would be a
quite an unusual presentation for an acute bleed/dementia
type presentation although he does have some elements of that
on his exam.

While he remained in the hospital he did not have any further
events similar to this one.  His blood pressure remained well
controlled.  He was started on folate because of his elevated
homocysteine.  Also started Lipitor for the patient for
stroke prophylaxis, and we continued him on his aspirin.  The
Renal service saw him and suggested several changes to his
blood pressure medications, which we have done.  He did have
one run of tachycardia on returning from hemodialysis.  His
EKG was unchanged since admission.

We will discharge the patient to home with follow up in the
outpatient clinic.  He will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient
and will continue hemodialysis with his renal doctor, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 805**].  He will also see his primary care physician in his
clinic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg a day.
2.  Calcium carbonate 1000 mg p.o. t.i.d.
3.  Atorvastatin 2 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Folic acid 1 mg a day.
5.  Losartan 50 mg, one tablet, p.o. q. day.
6.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. q. 12 hours for seven days.
7.  Levofloxacin 250 mg every other day for 14 days.
8.  Minoxidil 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Lopressor 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Nifedipine Extended Release 120 mg p.o. q. day.

Please note the patient was also seen and evaluated by
Physical Therapy who felt that the patient was stable for
discharge to home.
