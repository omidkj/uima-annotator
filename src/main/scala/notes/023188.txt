CT TORSO
1. Significant interval increase in the size of the large left
upper lobe mass as well as interval worsening of the liver and
splenic metastases.
2. Diffuse septal thickening, which may relate to congestive
heart failure. Lymphangitic spread of tumor cannot be excluded.
3. Mottled appearance of the iliac bones, which may relate to
metastatic lesions.

ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic
function
appears moderately depressed with global hypokinesis. [Intrinsic
left
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
severity of
valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet
is eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in
the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
No vegetations seen (cannot exclude).
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2152-10-12**], biventricular abnormalities are new and
mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now
significantly worse.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for sepsis and started on the MUST protocol.
Source of infection felt to be from the lungs, as pt with stage
4 lung cancer with rapidly growing tumor.  Felt to have post
obstructive PNA.  He was started on
vanco/flagyl/ceftriaxone/levo after being intubated in the ED.
He was started on levophed to maintain MAP>65.  He was
aggressively hydrated to keep CVP 8-12.  This was then backed
off as CVP was > 15.  Held his diuretics and anti-HTN meds.  Pt
was also in ARF was cr at 3.4 but this quickly improved with
fluids.  We were able to wean his vent settings to CPAP.  He was
seen by hepatology in regards to his liver transplant and
continued on tacrolimus.  Also followed by onc for his cancer.
It was felt that his cancer was end stage and no further
treatment was available given the extent of his disease.  With
time pressors were weaned off.  As patient improved he was
asking that the ETT be removed.  He ended up self extubating
himself.  But only lasted about 30 minutes before he became
severely acidotic and required reintubation.  He then self
extubated himself for a second and asked that he not be
re-intubated.  Discussion was held with family and patient.
Given poor prognosis due to the cancer, pt decided he wanted no
further treatment and requested comfort measures only.  All meds
were stopped except for morphine, ativan.  These were titrated
to comfort.  Pt then expired on [**2159-3-1**] at 1235pm with his
family at the bedside.
