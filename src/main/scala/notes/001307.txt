Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
.
# Cholangitis: Patient underwent urgent ERCP from the MICU with
distal CBD stone identified.  Sphincterotomy was performed with
successful stent placement.  She tolerated the procedure well
with improvement in her LFTs and abdominal pain.  Surgery was
consulted and recommended laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the
next 4-6 weeks.  Follow up was arranged.  However, 1 day after
admission, her blood culture returned positive for GNR.
Cefepime was started empirically.  Her blood cultures cleared
and the GNRs returned as E. coli and Klebsiella sensitive to
Cipro.  She was started on cipro and tolerated well.  She will
require follow up ERCP in [**5-4**] weeks, and to complete 14 days of
ciprofloxacin 500mg q12.
