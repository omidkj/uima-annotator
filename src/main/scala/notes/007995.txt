History of Present Illness:
71 year old F with PMH significant for advanced ischemic
cardiomyopathy EF 15%, atrial fibrillation with ICD and CKD who
presented to [**Hospital **] hospital [**2179-9-14**] for generalized weakness.
Patient reports gaining fluid (notably abdomen and lower
extremity) since early [**Month (only) 462**] and consequently toresmide was
increased and metolazone started. Per OMR notes patient's
creatinine increased to 4.7, had 15 pound weight loss (177 from
dry weight 190lb), lower blood pressures and was consequently
referred to [**Hospital **] Hospital. Due to weight loss all diuretics
were on hold since [**2179-9-7**]. Patient reports 1 month history of
increasing fatigue, weakness and shortness of breath. Denies
increase in orthopnea, PND. Denies syncope, pre-syncope or
dizziness. Denies chest pain. Denies fever, chills, cough or
increase in urination.
.
Patient's presenting vitals to [**Hospital **] Hospital were temperature
97.1, HR 70, RR 20, blood pressure 78/56. Labs notable for
creatinine of 4.7, Hematocrit 26.1, CBC 2.5, plt 60,000, INR
2.6. She was given 3 units pRBC and 2.5+ L of fluid. Cardiology
was consulted. Patient did not require pressor support. Heme was
consulted for pancytopenia felt to be secondary to hypersplenism
(demonstrated on ultrasound, new since 5/[**2177**]). Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further care.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative

CXR [**9-17**]:
AP chest compared to [**2175-9-20**]:
  Severe cardiomegaly has progressed. Lungs are clear. Pulmonary
and
mediastinal vasculature are unremarkable and there is no pleural
effusion.
Transvenous right atrial and left ventricular pacer leads and
right
ventricular pacer defibrillator lead are unchanged in their
respective
positions. No pneumothorax.
 .
Right Leg Ultrasound: [**2179-9-17**]
Grayscale color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common
femoral,
superficial femoral, popliteal, and tibial veins were performed.
There is
normal flow, compression and augmentation seen in all of the
vessels.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right
leg.
.
Abdominal Ultrasound: [**2179-9-17**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild splenomegaly.
2. No thrombus identified within the IVC.
3. Large amount of ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old female with severe biventricular failure with
profoundly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%,
moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation with
moderate pulmonary hypertension presented to outside hospital
for fatigue and hypotension. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
treatment of her renal failure and heart failure.
.
# PUMP: Patient with known ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%. New
splenomegaly concerning for worsening of EF. On admission, pt
was 7 lbs below her dry weight (190) and with poor renal
function therefore there was some concern for over-diuresis.
Gentle IVF was given and pt was allow to re-equilibrate. She
appeared to be perfusing well and did not require ionotropic
support.  Her renal function improved over the course of her
stay, as did her edema with PO intake and holding her diuretics.
 She was continued on her home cardiac meds including lisinopril
(decreased to 2.5/day), carvedilol and ASA.  She will be
discharged on 20 mg toresemide daily for diuresis. Her Fluid
status will need to be monitored very closely as she is quite
fragile. Daily weights will need to be monitored and as her
wieght increases, she will need to have more diuretics added on.
Please contact [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] NP, her heart failure NP for
further management at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**].
.
# RHYTHM: Mrs [**Known lastname **] is AV paced with right bundle branch
block with underlying A Fib.  She was treated with coumadin,
amiodarone and carvedilol.  Her coumadin was decreased on
discharge for elevated INR, and she will follow up for repeat
INR and warfarin adjustment.  She was seen by EP for evaluation
of her pacer settings, however adjustments were deferred to the
outpatient setting as changes need to be done under echo,
therefore she has an appointment scheduled this month for
adjustment of pacer settings.
.
# CORONARIES: One vessel coronary artery disease with patent
prior LAD stent. Last cath [**2171**]. No chest pain during this
admission.  ASA, carvedilol and statin were continued.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Her baseline creatinine is
1.3-2, during this visit creatinine peaked at 3.2 and was
thought to be pre-renal in the setting of over-diuresis.  Her
renal function improved with diuretics and encouraging PO
intake.
.
# Pancytopenia: Heme consulted at OSH - felt to be secondary to
splenomegaly secondary to CHF.  Platelets were stable during
this admission.  Would recommend following as an outpatient with
hematology.
.
# Asymmetric lower extremity swelling: Right > Left. LENI OSH
negative. Patient reports no recent instrumentation. This was
felt to be a chronic issue related to positioning as it is no
worse than baseline and the patient tends to lie primarily on
her right side.
.
# Hypothyroid: Her levothyroxine was continued at outpatient
doses.
.
# LE muscle spasm
Not a [**Last Name **] problem, pt states started about mid [**Month (only) **].
Interfering with activity, not able to walk now and is assist of
two to chair. Unclear how much hospitalization and
deconditioning are contributing. No improvement with hydration.
Electolytes WNL.  Pt was started on Ca and will follow-up as an
outpatient. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], a neurologist from [**Location (un) **] has been
contact[**Name (NI) **] to see the pt as soon as possible, her sister, will
help with setting this appt up in a timely manner.
