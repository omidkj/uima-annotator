Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line for blood pressure monitoring.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 59 year old right handed Chinese man with past
medical history of hypertension, asthma, eczema, allergic
rhinitis, chronic low back pain, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on
[**2123-2-22**] complaining of headache pain.

Patient was in his usual state of health until evening of
[**2123-2-21**]. At that time, he had gradual onset of headache,
described as a dull vise-like tightness, in the frontal area.
Associated with nausea, dizziness as in lightheadedness,
bilateral tingling of hands. No focal weakness, visual changes,
fevers, chills, meningismus, phonophobia, photophobia. He took
aspirin and motrin without relief. He tried a Chinese herbal tea
without relief. After headache had persisted for greater than 12
hours he called 911 and was transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

On arrival to ED, vitals temp 97.7, HT 84, BP 155/74, RR 17,
oxygen 98%/Room air. While in the ED, the numbness in his
fingers resolved. While in the ED, he received Toradol 30 mg IV,
Compazine 5 mg IV, Hydralazine 10 mg IV, and was loaded with 1
gram of Dilantin. Head CT showed a large right parietal
parasagittal hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage as
well. He was seen by Neurosurgery, who deferred surgical
intervention.

Per Neurosurgery recommendations, patient underwent an MRI/MRA
while in ED. This showed ntraparenchymal hemorrhage within the
medial right occipital lobe extending into the right lateral
ventricle without underlying enhancement. Given the presence of
multiple tiny foci of abnormal signal on susceptibility imaging
within the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia, the brainstem,
and cerebellum, this finding was felt to represent an acute
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the setting of chronic
amyloidosis or chronic hypertensive hemorrhage.

He was admitted to the Neurology service for further work up and
management. Follow up head CT on [**2123-2-23**] showed stable
appearance of hemorrhage and no evidence of increased
intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus.

to say months of year backwards. Fluent speech, repetition,
naming intact. Able to read and write. Memory [**1-21**] registration,
recall [**1-21**] at 5 minutes. No apraxia. Left sided neglect.

Cranial nerves: Patient unable to cooperate with formal visual
fields but blinks to threat bilaterally. Pupils round 2 mm->
1.5mm with light. Extraocular eye movements intact without
nystagmus. Normal facial sensation and strength.
Hearing intact to finger rub. Palate rises symmetrically.
Tongue midline.

Motor: Normal tone and bulk.  No tremors or fasciculations.
Pronator drift absent. Patient in fair amount of distress from
headache, so did not formally test resistance. Able to hold both
arms and legs against gravity for several seconds.

Reflexes: There are [**12-25**] reflexes in upper extremities. Right
patella 3+ with spread. No clonus. Plantar reflexes extensor
bilaterally.

Sensory: Intact to light touch.

Coordination: Intact finger to nose bilaterally.

CT head without contrast: There is a nearly 24-mm area of acute
hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe in a medial
parasagittal locale. There is moderate extension of the
hemorrhage into the right lateral ventricle, with a tiny amount
of hemorrhage seen in the anterior aspect of the third ventricle
near the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**]. A small quantity of blood is also
seen in the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. There is a mild amount of edema
surrounding the right parietal hemorrhage, most notably superior
to the hemorrhage itself. Additionally, there is an 11- mm area
of hypodensity within the left frontal lobe white matter and an
approximately 5 mm solitary hypodense zone within the right
frontal white matter. There is no hydrocephalus. There is
effacement of the right cerebral hemisphere cortical sulci
superiorly, likely due to the mass effect of the hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures. There is a
prominent degree of mucosal thickening within both ethmoid sinus
complexes, the right maxillary sinus, and in the sphenoid sinus.
There is a suggestion that some of this mucosal thickening may
be polypoid in configuration. Additional probable polyps are
seen within the nasal cavity bilaterally. No other overt
extracranial abnormalities are seen.
CONCLUSION: Large right parietal parasagittal hemorrhage with
intraventricular hemorrhage as well. In conjunction with the
hypodense areas within both frontal lobes, the most common
differential diagnostic consideration would be hemorrhage,
possibly into an underlying infarction with additional areas of
prior brain infarction. This diagnosis is favored if there is a
history of chronic hypertension. Alternatively, hemorrhage into
a preexistent tumor, with the additional hypodense foci possibly
representing other sites of neoplastic disease could be
considered. An underlying vascular malformation would be
statistically less likely.

MRI head [**2123-2-22**]: A focus of acute hemorrhage is present within
the medial right occipital lobe with extension into the right
lateral ventricle. No underlying abnormal enhancement is
present. Scattered tiny foci of abnormal signal on
susceptibility imaging are present in the cerebral cortex,
thalamus, basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellum. . A chronic area
of lacunar infarction is present within the white matter of the
left frontal lobe. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus or
shift of midline structures. There is no evidence of signal
abnormalities on diffusion weighted imaging to suggest acute
infarction.
IMPRESSION:
1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the medial right occipital
lobe extending into the right lateral ventricle without
underlying enhancement. Given the presence of multiple tiny foci
of abnormal signal on susceptibility imaging within the cerebral
cortex, the basal ganglia, the brainstem, and cerebell
