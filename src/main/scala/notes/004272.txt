HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 51-year-old female with
known history of diabetes mellitus and a strong family
history for coronary artery disease awoke on [**2140-5-31**] with
some crushing chest pain radiating to her left arm and back
and felt very lightheaded.  She went to an outside hospital
where her Troponin was elevated and she ruled in for a non ST
elevation myocardial infarction.  She was transferred into
[**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization on [**2140-6-2**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

Status post cervical cancer in [**2127**] with hysterectomy.

Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2139-1-7**] with
slurred speech and left sided weakness but no residual
effect.

Status post pin placement left knee.

Status post appendectomy.

Status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Levaquin.

Morphine.

Demerol.  Both Morphine and Demerol produce nausea and
vomiting.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day.
2. Insulin 70/30 mix 42 units q AM, 30 units q PM.
3. Glucophage 1000 mg p.o. twice a day.

Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2140-6-2**] on her
admission with the following results.  Ejection fraction 45%.
Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 29.  Mild diffuse
left main disease, moderate diffuse mid-LAD disease, severe
diffuse mid to distal left anterior descending coronary
artery, totally occluded left circumflex and severe diffuse
disease of the right coronary artery.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  The patient reported an 80 pound recent
weight loss that was intentional.  She also admitted to
frequent urinary tract infections, some wheezing and some
abdominal pain with palpation which he has always had, the
workup is negative.  She also said she had no thyroid
problems, bleeding or clotting problems.  She worked as a
manager of a convenience store, she had no tobacco or no
alcohol history and no use of marijuana or cocaine and lived
alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her pulse is 106, blood pressure
138/73, respiratory rate 16.  She is sating 97% on two
liters.  She was awake, and alert and oriented.  Her pupils
equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.  EOM's
were intact.  Her strength was equal upper extremities and
lower extremities bilaterally.  Her heart was regular rate
and rhythm with no murmur, with no rub.  Her abdomen was
obese with positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, with some
tenderness to palpation as previously reported.  The patient
said her abdomen is always tender, the workup was negative
prior to this admission.  The patient did have some heme
positive emesis in the catheter laboratory with small amount
of not frank blood.

Preop laboratory:  White count 10.7, hematocrit 37.0,
platelet count 250,000, sodium 136, K 4.2, chloride 102, CO2
24, BUN 21, creatinine 0.8 with a blood sugar of 360.
Prothrombin time 13.2, INR 1.2, PTT 28.4, ALT 30, AST 109,
alkaline phosphatase 79, total bilirubin 0.6, amylase 39,
lipase was pending.  Type and screen was placed on the
computer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulses:  The right femoral was in a
sheath but popliteal, dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial,
radial were all 2+.  On the left leg, femoral, popliteal,
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial and radial were all 2+.
The patient had no bruits appreciated in either carotid
artery.  Her extremities had no edema or varicosities.  Chest
x-ray and urinalysis were ordered.  Decision was made to try
and get carotid ultrasounds prior to the operating room.
Aggrastat was to be discontinued at midnight which the
patient had been placed on after her cardiac catheterization.

Later that evening the patient did complain of some heaviness
in her chest with no shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting
but a little bit of a cough.  Blood pressure was 157 and then
went down to 119/62, Heparin drip was to be started four
hours after the sheath pull with a plan to start the patient
on a Nitroglycerin drip if the chest pain returned.  The
patient was pain free later on, on Heparin drip.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] saw the patient on the 28th and explained
relative high risk of her case.  He spoke to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**]
to have him reassess the patient.  The patient did go to the
cardiac catheter laboratory on [**7-4**] for preoperative intra-
aortic balloon in preparation of her surgery.

The patient's height is 5 foot, 1 inches with a weight of 229
pounds.  The balloon was placed in the left femoral artery on
[**6-3**] prior to surgery and prior to the operating room she
was on Heparin and Nitroglycerin drips.  She also received
Midazolam preoperatively and received 10 units of regular
insulin sliding scale for a blood sugar of 361 at 10 o'clock
that morning.  Of note, the patient did not receive her
carotid ultrasound due to the fact of her instability and
intra-aortic balloon placement and moving to the operating
room for her coronary surgery which was performed on [**6-3**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] with a catheter coronary artery bypass grafting
times three with a left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending coronary artery,  to the posterior
descending coronary artery and to the obtuse marginal.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
care unit on a Propofol drip at 30 mcs per kilo per minute
and a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.5 mcs per kilo per minute in
stable condition.  In the evening of [**2140-6-4**] there is no
examination note to be found in the chart from postop day one
on [**6-4**] however, there are a couple of events.  The patient
had already been extubated after her operation by the time
she was seen by Anesthesia for the postop check.  She was on
Nordinone at that time for decreased cardiac output.  She was
otherwise stable.  She was seen at 7 o'clock in the evening
on postop day one by the Cardiology Fellow for a diffuse
anterior ST elevation.  She was hemodynamically stable
without any symptoms.  TTE was performed Stat which showed
that the walls were contracting vigorously and laterally and
at the septum but the anterior inferior walls were less well
seen but appeared to contract well also.  There was some
trace MR with an injection fraction of greater than 50%  No
effusion was seen on parasternal and apical views, no
subcostal views were performed due to habitus, wires and
chest tube drains.  The assessment by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2232**] was that
there was no evidence of acute ischemic territory on limited
views and that he recommended if she became hemodynamically
unstable or had symptoms to consider Transesophageal
echocardiography.

On the evening of [**2140-6-3**] the patient remained on
Propofol and insulin drip.  She was also started on Malarone
drip but was extubated by the time Anesthesia saw her on
postop day one.  On postop day she remained on a Neo-
Synephrine drip at 0.5 mcs per kilo per minute, on aspirin,
Plavix, Lasix twice a day, and Lopressor twice a day, off her
beta-blockade.  She continued with perioperative Vancomycin
for coverage.  Her balloon was at 1-to-1.  She was in sinus
tach at 114, blood pressure of 92/73 with a cardiac index of
2.1 with the balloon on 1-to-1.  She was sating 96% on three
liters.

Laboratory:  White count 17.1, hematocrit 32.1, platelet
count 140,000.  Sodium 141, K 5.3, chloride 104, CO2 23, BUN
24, creatinine 1.5 with a blood sugar of 129 and a lactate of
1.2.  INR of 1.3, Prothrombin time 13.8, PTT 29.1.  Her
pacing wires remain in place.  She was tachycardiac as noted.
Incisions were clean, dry and intact.  She got a new A-line
and the decision was made to at least discuss the Sinatracor.
She received Lasix 60 mg times one to help boost her urine
output.

On postop day two at 11:30 in the morning her intra-aortic
balloon pump was removed the Cardiology Fellow with good
pulses and no hematoma formation

On postop day three she remained on Neo-Synephrine drip at
0.25 mcs per kilo per minute, continuing with aspirin,
Plavix, Lasix and Lopressor.  She was also on a
