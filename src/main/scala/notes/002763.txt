Admission Date:  [**2143-11-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2143-11-4**]

Date of Birth:   [**2087-12-26**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Non ST elevation MI.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 98237**] is a 55-year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease status post
MI times three, last in [**2136**] that was treated with a PTCA to
the right coronary and left circumflex.  She was brought in
from an outside hospital where the patient had presented with
left sided chest pressure.  The patient had described the
pressure as [**7-30**] and radiation to the back and to both arms.
It was associated with diaphoresis and nausea.  The patient
described the pain as exactly the same as her previous MI and
that took her to the ED at the outside hospital.

At the outside hospital, she was given aspirin, Nitroglycerin
and Morphine without relief of the pain.  EKG read at the
outside hospital as no acute changes and her CK at the
outside hospital was negative.  However, the chest pain
persisted.  The patient was started on anticoagulation and
her second CK came back at 1100 with positivity for
myocardial infarction.  The patient was then started on AV
heparin and Integrilin.  She continued to have chest pain
[**3-29**], but her EKG continued to be read as normal.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac catheterization.

At cardiac catheterization, the patient was shown to have
left anterior descending lesion 90% which was stented.  The
patient then became chest pain free post catheterization for
the first time and remained chest pain free and without
shortness of breath for the remainder of her hospitalization.
At baseline, of note, the patient has minimal exercise
capacity limited by back pain.  Her last stress test was two
years ago which was within normal limits per the patient.

ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with her husband and four
kids.  She has a 30 pack year history of smoking, quit four
years ago.  Denies any alcohol or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation at which time she was
on Integrilin drips and Nitrodrip include the following, a
temperature of 96.6 F, pulse 103, blood pressure 140/58,
breathing 17, saturating at 94% on two liters.  She weighed
137 kilograms.  General:  She was a pleasant, obese woman in
no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Oropharynx
clear.  Mucous membranes dry.  Neck was full, but there was
no jugular venous distention visualized.  Chest:  Distant
breath sounds with faint wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Chest and
heart sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Bowel
sounds normal, obese, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  Trace edema.  Positive erythema with a raised
margin and satellite lesions in her bilateral groins.  She
had 2+ distal lower extremity pulses.  Neurologically:  Alert
and oriented.  Moving all extremities symmetrically.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs at the outside hospital showed an ABG
of 7.32, 54 and 102, no ventilator settings or oxygenation
information is available.

The first set of labs available from [**Hospital3 **] were on the
15th which showed a CBC with a white blood cell count of
10.7, hematocrit 41.1, platelets 206.

CK of 6, CK MB of 30.  She had a PT of 12.4, PTT of 20.4 and
an INR of 1.0.  She had a potassium of 4.1, BUN 9, creatinine
0.6.  Total cholesterol 174, HDL 51, LDL 68, triglycerides
276.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which
demonstrated the following:  Markedly elevated left sided
filling pressures and left ventricular ejection fraction of
25%, anterolateral apical and distal inferior akinesis, no
mitral regurgitation.

Coronary angiography determined the following:  She was right
dominant.  Her left main coronary artery was normal.  Her
left anterior descending artery was 95% mid stenosed with
moderate calcium.  Her D1 was 70% occluded and the origin of
D2 was 60% occluded.  Left circumflex showed minimal luminal
irregularities and proximal stent widely patent.  Her RCA
showed a mid RCA stent mildly patent, minimal luminal
irregularities throughout.

In addition, the day of discharge the patient had the
following laboratory values.  CBC:  White blood cell count
8.3, hemoglobin 13.7, hematocrit 40.8, platelets 175.  PT
13.3, PTT 71.1 and INR of 1.2.  Her Chemistry 7 was as
follows with a sodium of 137, potassium 3.4, chloride 94,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 8, creatinine 0.5.  CK was 168.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was found to have a 90%
occluded left anterior descending artery which was stented
with good success and with subsequent relief of her chest
pain.  She had initially been continued on 48 hours total of
Integrilin and anticoagulated with IV heparin.  Her pump
function was noted to be roughly 25% left ventricular
ejection fraction with akinesis throughout.  She was gently
diuresed and she was treated with Captopril and Isordil, beta
blocker for pressure control after Nitrodrip had been weaned
off.

She remained chest pain free and free of shortness of breath
and palpitations throughout her hospital course.  The patient
was noted throughout hospital to have significant
biventricular ectopy and was continued on her beta blocker.

2.  HEMATOLOGIC:  The patient had been on Integrilin for
lysis of her thrombotic left anterior distending artery.  She
received 48 hours total of Integrilin.  She then was started
on Plavix and aspirin.  After cardiac catheterization, she
was also started on Coumadin and continued on her heparin.
The day of discharge, the heparin was turned off and Coumadin
was maintained at 7.5.  Her INR was 1.2.  The Plavix was
continued as was the aspirin.

The patient is to receive a total of 30 days of Plavix and to
go home on baby aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. in the setting of
receiving Plavix as well.  She is to have her INR checked two
days after discharge and indicates that she will do so.  The
primary care physician will check for her INR goal which is
2.0 to 3.0.

3.  ENDOCRINOLOGY:  Patient has a history of insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus.  Her blood sugars remained
roughly 150 to 200 throughout her hospital stay.  She was
initially treated with an insulin drip then transferred to
Humalog 75/25 q. AM and q. PM and covered with a regular
insulin sliding scale.  She is to resume taking her Metformin
and her Glyburide when she gets home at the previous doses.
Her Metformin was held for 48 hours following post
catheterization.  She is also to continue on her Levoxyl 200
mcg p.o. q. day.

4.  DERMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have a likely
tinea infection of her bilateral groin.  She was treated with
Nystatin cream.

5.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  The patient was
noted to have some wheezing on admission.  She was treated
with Albuterol and Atrovent metered dose inhaler and
nebulizers p.r.n.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Patient was in good condition at
discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post non ST elevation myocardial infarction of the
anterior wall with 90% left anterior descending occlusion
status p
