LABS AND PERTINENT DATA:  Transthoracic echocardiogram on
[**10-11**] demonstrated diastolic dysfunction with
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction
of 50% to 55%, no wall motion abnormality, mild pulmonary
hypertension, severe aortic stenosis, 1+ mitral
regurgitation, and moderate left atrial and right atrial
dilatation.

CONTINUATION WITH HOSPITAL COURSE:  Postoperative day #1,
status post right groin hematoma evacuation and
pseudoaneurysm repair.  The patient demonstrated significant
oozing from the groin site and JP drains.  The patient
required a total of 6 units of packed red blood cells, 4
units of fresh frozen plasma, 25 mg of protamine, and 4 mg of
intravenous vitamin K before the patient's hematocrit
stabilized at 28.  The patient's platelet count dropped
concurrently with the hematocrit to a nadir of 102.  the
etiology of thrombocytopenia was likely delusional, given the
negative DIC panel and spontaneous resolution.  Late on
postoperative day #1, the patient had new onset atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable and was loaded on intravenous
amiodarone with conversion to normal sinus rhythm.  The
patient continued on low dose oral amiodarone.

After significant volume resuscitation for the initial
hypotension and subsequent multiple transfusions, the patient
required diuresis for total body volume overload.  A
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.
The patient continued with stable oxygen requirement and
remained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of
postoperative day #1.  The patient continued on cefazolin for
prophylaxis from the time of surgery to the time of
discontinuation of JP drains.  Despite decreased oozing from
the groin site and JP drain output, the patient's hematocrit
continued to drop from 29 to 27 and the patient received an
additional 2 units of packed red blood cells with an
appropriate increase in hematocrit.

Early on postoperative day #2, the patient demonstrated
frequent ectopy and reverted to atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response, well tolerated.  The patient
continued to diurese, however demonstrated worsening failure
with decreasing O2 saturations and increasing oxygen
requirement over the course of the day.  The patient was
aggressively diuresed and oxygen saturation stabilized.  The
Swan-Ganz catheter was removed on postoperative day #1 and a
triple lumen placed over a wire for intravenous access.

On postoperative day #3, the patient's hematocrit stabilized
greater than 30 without subsequent transfusion.  The patient
was out of bed to a chair with assistance with stable JP
drainage.  The patient remained in rapid atrial fibrillation
and the electrophysiology service was consulted.  After
conferring with the vascular service, the patient was started
on heparin (no bolus) and Coumadin for planned electrical
cardioversion.

On postoperative day #4, the patient's hematocrit remained
stable with no further evidence of bleeding and stable JP
drain outpatient.  The medial JP drain was removed without
complication.  The patient was subsequently D/C cardioverted
to normal sinus rhythm without complication.

On postoperative day #5, the patient remained in normal sinus
rhythm.  The patient's hematocrit remained stable and the
patient was transferred to the medicine floor.

On postoperative day #6, the patient had a transient (several
hour) episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response, hemodynamically stable.  The patient spontaneously
converted to normal sinus rhythm on continued amiodarone
loading.  The patient remained afebrile without signs of
infection on continued cefazolin for prophylaxis.  The
patient's Foley catheter was removed.

At the time of dictation, the patient's lateral [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drain remains in place with an average 400 to 500 cc
serosanguinous output q 24 hours.  The patient remains on
cefazolin, day #7, for continued prophylaxis while JP drain
remains in place.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Cefazolin 1 gm intravenous q 8 hours (until JP drain
removed)
2.  Amiodarone 400 mg po bid x2 weeks, then 400 mg po q day
x1 month
3.  Coumadin (dose to be determined with goal INR 2 to 3)
4.  Colace 100 mg po bid
5.  Lasix 40 mg po q day

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to be discharged to
acute rehabilitation for physical therapy and continued
medical management of right groin hematoma/JP drain.  The
patient will require daily blood work for INR levels until
stable Coumadin dose is established.  The patient is
instructed to follow up with her primary care physician in
one to two weeks post discharge.  The patient will require
subsequent follow up with a CT surgeon for elective aortic
valve replacement.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atrial flutter, status post ablation
2.  Right groin hematoma, status post open reduction
evacuation and pseudoaneurysm repair
3.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response,
status post D/C cardioversion
4.  Diastolic dysfunction
5.  Chronic lower extremity edema
6.  Mild hypertension
7.  Severe aortic stenosis
8.  Hypercholesterolemia
9.  Status post right knee replacement
10. Status post total abdominal hysterectomy for endometrial
cancer complicated by surgical hernias
11. Status post abdominal hernia repair
