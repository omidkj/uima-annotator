PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is
moderately enlarged and unchanged. There is a moderate-sized
left pleural
effusion with subpulmonic component and a small right pleural
effusion. No
definite focal opacities are seen. No evidence of pneumothorax
or pulmonary
edema.

IMPRESSION:

FINAL REPORT


CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE.

REASON: Preop.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid
arteries. Minimal
plaques identified.

On the right, peak systolic velocities are 39, 47, and 58 in the
ICA, CCA, and
ECA respectively. This is consistent with no stenosis.

On the left, peak systolic velocities are 40, 43, and 64 in the
ICA, CCA, and
ECA respectively. This is consistent with no stenosis.

There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of stenosis in either carotid artery.
