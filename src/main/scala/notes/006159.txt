Imaging:

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2180-4-8**] 4:55
PM
IMPRESSION:  Worsening bibasilar airspace opacities concerning
for pneumonia or aspiration.

Radiology Report CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2180-4-9**]
1:13 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Multifocal ground-glass opacities involving all lung lobes
in a basilar predominant distribution, with multifocal
consolidations in the lower lobes. Bilateral lower lobe
bronchiectasis and peribronchial thickening.  Findings  are
suggestive of multifocal pneumonia superimposed upon changes of
COPD.  Reimaging after resolution of symptoms is indicated to
exclude underlying tumor.
2.  Soft tissue density at the left hilum and mediastinum
appears grossly
similar to prior examinations but is suboptimally evaluated on
this
noncontrast examination.  This may represent post treatment
change although residual tumor or local recurrence cannot be
ruled out and attention at repeat (preferable contrast-enhanced)
examination is recommended in short interval.
3.  Small airway disease with air trapping consistent with COPD.
Unchanged
post-radiation changes in the left upper lobe.

[**2180-4-12**] Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. No valvular pathology or
pathologic flow identified.

ECG:

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2180-4-8**]  4:55:18 PM


Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Relatively low voltage
diffusely.
Non-specific ST-T wave change. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2178-6-30**]
resting heart rate is faster without overall diagnostic change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 65yo female with hx of COPD, non small cell lung
cancer s/p chemo and radiation in [**2175**] who presented with
dyspnea found to be hypoxic and with multilobar pneumonia on CT
scan. She was treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin.

# Multilobar pneumonia: Pt presented with dyspnea and hypoxia.
Patient was recently discharged on home oxygen from recent
hospitalization but she stopped using it because she was told it
was no longer required. The patient improved clinically on
vancomycin and levofloxacin.  Culture of mucous plug revealed
MRSA.  The patient was discharged for an 8 day course of
levofloxacin and 9 day course of vancomycin.  Because of her
underlying COPD, the patient was treated with ipratropium and
albuterol nebs ahd she was placed on a prednisone taper.  The
patient's O2 sats and dyspnea improved with treatment. She will
need follow up CT scan preferably with contrast if her kidney
function tolerates to r/o recurrence of tumor.

# Acute on chronic kidney disease ?????? Patient presented with Cr
slightly up at 1.7 from baseline (1.2-1.5) likely related to
poor po intake.  Her Cr was down to 1.5 on last check.

# Obstructive sleep apnea - conti
