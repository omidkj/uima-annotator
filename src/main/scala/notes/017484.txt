HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 -year-old
woman with a history of severe O2 dependent chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (FEV1 0.65), recurrent
pneumonia, who transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for further
evaluation and treatment of a chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease pneumonia.  The patient was recently admitted to this
hospital on [**8-1**] with a right lower lobe pneumonia and
she was treated with azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and then
discharged home on Ceftin.  A follow up chest x-ray in the
morning showed resolution of this right lower lobe pneumonia,
but the patient continued to have sputum production, so she
was treated with one week of Levaquin.  The patient was also
subsequently on dicloxacillin for a non-healing wound on her
left leg and left lower extremity cellulitis.

The patient was doing quite well until the evening prior to
admission when she developed sudden onset of chills, fever,
and shortness of breath and vomiting.  The patient described
that she could not fill her lungs with air.  She complains of
only minimal cough which is productive of yellow sputum.  She
denies hemoptysis and chest pain.  The patient took her
metered dose inhalers without improvement, then called her
visiting nurse, who had her taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital.

At [**Location (un) **], her temperature was 101.6 F and her white blood
cell count was 30.  Chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe
infiltrate.  She was given 125 mg of IV Solu-Medrol and a
dose of cefuroxime and Biaxin, as well as Albuterol
nebulizers.  The patient was referred to [**Hospital3 **] -
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] at the request of the family and
patient.

At baseline, the patient does a treadmill for thirty minutes
a day with four liters of O2.  She has baseline orthopnea and
occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, but denies recent
worsening of these symptoms.  She had recently been on Lasix
for increased shortness of breath and lower extremity edema,
but this was recently discontinued.  She denies sick contacts
or travel.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No nausea, positive vomiting, no
abdominal pain.  No urinary symptoms.  No headaches or visual
changes.  She complains of post nasal drip.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

history of frequent pneumonias, the last pneumonia was [**8-9**].
Last steroid use was in [**Month (only) 359**].  Pulmonary function test
from [**2124-10-19**]: FEV1 0.65 (35%), FEC 2.15 (81%), ratio 43%.

scan.

Atrovent four puffs qid, Serevent two puffs [**Hospital1 **], Albuterol
two puffs q four hours prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband in a
retirement community.  Her son is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 18920**].  She
smoked one pack a day for forty years, but quit twenty years
ago.  She denies alcohol use or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 98.8 F,
blood pressure 116/70, pulse 100, respiratory rate 28, O2
saturation 95% on three liters.  General appearance: the
patient is a thin, elderly woman with tachypnea and shortness
of breath, with approximately five word sentences.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat: Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light, sclerae anicteric, oropharynx clear, and
noticeable use of accessory muscles for breathing.  Neck: no
lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention, supple.

Respiratory: decreased breath sounds with left basilar
crackles and rhonchi, positive egophony in the left lower
lobe.  Her I/E ratio is approximately 1:3 without wheezes.
Cardiovascular: tachycardic, regular rhythm, normal S1, S2,
no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen: bowel sounds present,
abdomen is soft and nontender, nondistended, with no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities: 1+ edema in the left lower
extremity with 1.0-2.0 cm ulcer with granulation tissue at
the base without surrounding erythema or cellulitic changes.
Neurologic: alert and oriented times three, cranial nerves II
through XII intact.  Strength and sensation grossly intact.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  White count 42, hematocrit 38,
platelets 297,000.  Sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride 99,
CO2 25, BUN 12, creatinine 0.5, glucose 132.  Arterial blood
gas: 7.43 / 41 / 61, saturating 92% on two liters nasal
cannula.  Calcium 8.7, phosphorus 2.8, magnesium 1.2.

Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate, hyperexpanded
lungs, and air bronchogram.  Electrocardiogram was without
change from prior electrocardiogram from [**Month (only) 216**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  Pneumonia - the patient was admitted for a
left lower lobe pneumonia as evidenced upon x-ray and
examination.  She was treated with Levaquin 500 mg once a day
to which she responded.  She was also treated with chest
physical therapy, suction, and Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers q two to four hours prn.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - on admission, the
patient had an increased O2 requirement from her baseline,
poor air movement, tachypnea, and increased work of
breathing.  Her initial saturations were about 92% on three
liters.  She was treated with a second dose of IV Solu-Medrol
125 mg and then 100 mg q eight hours times one day, and then
a prednisone taper.

On hospital day two in the evening, the patient required
transfer to the Intensive Care Unit for noninvasive pressure
ventilation due to patient tiring.  The patient tolerated
this well with improved O2 saturations.  She was transferred
back to the regular floor on hospital day five.  The
prednisone taper was continued, as was Levaquin.  The patient
continued to improve back to her baseline O2 requirement of
approximately two liters at rest.  However, she continued to
have decreased exercise tolerance.

It was felt that the patient would benefit from pulmonary
rehabilitation due to the frequency of her recent pulmonary
infections and her decreased exercise capacity.  The patient
also continued to have a bronchospastic cough, but had
resolution of pneumonia. The patient will be continued on
Levaquin for a fourteen day course and a steroid taper.

2.  Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient had
decreased po intake during the first part of her
hospitalization.  She was started on Boost with meals to
supplement her intake.  She also took a multivitamin once a
day.

3.  Skin:  On admission, the patient had a 1.0-2.0 cm ulcer
on her left lower extremity.  Treatment with Santyl ointment
and dry sterile dressing changes were continued.  The patient
underwent evaluation by wound care nurse who recommended
continuation of the Santyl ointment as well as [**Male First Name (un) **]
compression stockings to bilateral lower extremities.

CODE STATUS:  The patient was initially do not resuscitate /
do not intubate on admission.  However, after successful
treatment with noninvasive pressure ventilation, the patient
changed her status to do not resuscitate with intubate if
condition was felt to be reversible with the condition of
extubating after three to five days.  Suggested on further
admission that the topic of intubation status be addressed
with the patient in the context of her presentation at that
time.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To pulmonary rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
3.  Anxiety.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q
