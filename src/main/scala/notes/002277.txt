Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32923**] is a 84 year old male with DM2 who presented
with shortness of breath and abdominal pain, found to be
consistent with heart failure exacerbation resulting in demand
ischemia vs. UA/NSTEMI, found to have 3VD on cath.
.
Cardiac
1)Ischemia: Mr. [**Known lastname 32923**] presented with heart failure and ST
elevation of aVR.  As his ECG was concerning for severe disease,
he was taken to the cath lab for possible evaluation.  He was
found to have 3VD and he was evaluated by CV surgery for
possible CABG.  He was taken off of Plavix for possible surgery.
 They requested an echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound.  He
was found to have right ICA 70-79% stenosis, left ICA 60-69%
stenosis.  It was also noted that the patient had aortic
calcifications on CT scan.  The above risk factors in addition
to his renal disease and advanced age pushed the decision
towards medical management.  Plavix and aspirin were restarted.
.
2) LV function: The patient had a echo done on [**10-17**] which
showed an EF>60%.  However, it was felt that the patient's
shortness of breath was likely secondary to pulmonary edema as
he had a PCWP >18.  He was diuresed during this admission
(78kg->73kg) and electrolytes were followed.  Diuresis resulted
in improved oxygen saturation and he was weaned from 4L NC to 2L
NC. Given appearance on CXR, there was some concern he may have
underlying lung disease. Would consider outpatient PFTs and
chest CT for further evaluation. He was discharged to home with
home O2 and PCP f/u.
.
3) Hypertension: Mr. [**Known lastname 32923**] had persistently high blood
pressures on hospital day [**2-2**].  He was placed on a nitro drip,
started on metoprolol.  He was switched back to his outpatient
regimen of labetolol 900mg [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 160mg [**Hospital1 **], and norvasc
10mg QD.  The nitro drip was weaned off on HD4 and imdur was
started in its place.  Off of the nitro drip his SBPs have been
in the 150-160s which is probably appropriate for him given his
heart disease.
.
4) Renal: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.8.  He was
given a dye load during catheterization and therefore his
creatinine was carefully monitored.  He has a slight increase in
creatinine which was felt to be due to diuresis. At discharge,
the patient's creatinine was at baseline.
.
5) Neuro: Mr. [**Known lastname 32923**] was disoriented during the admission,
occassionally unable to name the hospital and the date, likely
due to acute delerium on baseline dementia.  His mental status
appeared to improve throughout the day.  His delirium was likely
due to the hospitalization.  He was closely monitored for signs
of infection and his CXR was clear of infiltrate and UA was
negative.
.
6) Anemia: The patient reports a history of anemia for which he
receives procrit every 3 weeks.  He received 2U on this
admission with a less than expected bump in hematocrit.  He was
guaiac negative and following hematocrits increased
appropriately.

7) Endocrine: Mr. [**Known lastname 32923**] has type 2 DM, with a HgbA1c of
7.1%.  He was placed on a regular insulin sliding scale, with
QACHS finger sticks, but given his daily requirements was also
placed on fixed dose glargine. He was discharge on home insulin
and was instructed to measure fingersticks [**Hospital1 **] prior to his PCP
f/u appointment so that his insulin regimen can be appropriately
adjusted.

8) FEN: The patient was diuresed and therefore electrolytes were
checked frequently.  He was repleted as necessary.  He was
taking good PO.  His B12 level was checked as he was on
supplementation as an outpatient and was found to be within
normal limits.  He was continued on supplemental B12 while an
inpatient.

9) PPx: He was given pneumoboots while he was unable to
ambulate.
