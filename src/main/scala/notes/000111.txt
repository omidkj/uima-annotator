Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF exacerbation: On arrival in the ED, her O2 sats was 75%
on RA, BP 128/78 (which increased to 180/68), 68, and RR 12
(increased to 24). She was placed on BiPap with increase in O2
sat to 91%. CXR indicative of pulmonary edema. Received total of
120 mg IV Lasix with good diuresis, nebs prn, ceftriaxone 1 g
IV. When her BP increased to 180s, she was begun on a nitro gtt
and also received hydralazine 10 mg IV x1. Her bp later dropped
to 80/40, and her nitro was turned off with good BP response.
She was also noted to have non specific lateral ST segment
depression on EKG, with serial negative cardiac enzymes.  Pt
maintained on lasix 80 mg po QD with decent response (~1L net
neg per day).  Did require a few doses of IV lasix 80 mg to
maintain this urine output.  She was also placed on lopressor
and her dose was titrated up to 25mg po TID.  Her heart rate is
in the 60's and she likely has some baseline SA dysfunction
based on her age (i.e. sclerosis), but the further rate control
should help her diastolic filling in addition.  This CHF exac
likely [**3-12**] lingular PNA, pt recieving ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia.  Clinda was added
to cover for possible aspiration.  Will d/c for total of 10 day
course of antibiotics.  On the 8th hospital day, her antibiotics
were changed from IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin to PO
levaquin.  The patient now denies SOB, orthopnea or cough.  She
is able to ambulate with help.  She may need 1-2 L O2 by NC at
[**Hospital3 **] to keep her O2 sat betwwen 90-93%.

2.  ST changes: Evaluated by cards in ED. Liekly demand
ischemia, with ST depressions transiently. TTE with no wall
motion abnormalities. Patient was placed on BB for both
decreased myocardial demand and for decreased inotropy and
chronotropy with regard to diastolic dysfunction.  No further
risk stratification was done to the patient since no
intervention would be done in the case of abdnormal result.

3.  DVT: Dx'd [**5-13**].  Pt was supratherapeutic with an INR >8sec
on admission.  Coumadin was held until [**10-29**] when re-institued.
She takes 6mg Tuesdays and Fridays, and 4mg the rest of the
weekdays.  Her coumadin will be managed at [**Hospital3 2558**].  The
coumadin clinic was made aware of this.

4.  Anemia:  Pt is iron deficient.  She will be discharged with
oral ferrous gluconate.  She recieved no blood transfusions.
Her pending iron studies will be followed up by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 665**].

5.  Fall:  The patient fell from a mechanical fall with no LOC.
She had a negative head CT.

6.  Pul Hypertension:  The patient has a chart history of OSA.
She has severe pulmonary arterial hypertension consistent either
with OSA or chronic PE.  She is anticoagulated for prevention of
PE, and our pretest probability for PE while being
anticoagulated is low such that she does not require [**Location (un) **]
placement.  She may need a sleep study to determine if she has
OSA.
