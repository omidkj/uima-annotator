HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
gentleman with a history of left subdural hematoma, who was
admitted on [**2165-3-30**] to [**Hospital1 188**] status post a fall down a flight of stairs while on
Coumadin for previous cerebrovascular accident.  At the time,
the patient has also had a hemothorax on the right side, and
was admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit with a chest
tube in place.  He was awake, alert, and oriented times three
with 5/5 muscle strength in all muscle groups at the time of
admission.

On the second or third day hospital stay, the patient
developed electrocardiogram changes and had ruled in for a
myocardial infarction.  An echocardiogram later revealed an
ejection fraction of 25%.  The patient developed right sided
weakness also at this time.  He was intubated, sedated, and
eventually awoke, but continued to have the right sided
weakness.

Serial head CT scans showed no change in the size of the
subdural hematoma, and it was decided that patient would not
undergo drainage of the subdural hematoma.  The patient
eventually got trached and PEG and was transferred to
rehabilitation.

While at rehab, the patient had a worsening examination.
Apparently, he had regained some tone on the right side,
which was then gone and was brought to [**Hospital1 190**] where a CT scan showed an increase in the size
of the left subdural hematoma.  Patient had 12 mm of midline
shift with a 30 mm subdural hematoma which was chronic in
appearance.

The patient was drained at the bedside.  Was kept in the
Recovery Room overnight.  Neurologically would open his eyes.
Began following simple commands.  Would stick out his tongue,
would state his name, had increased tone on the right side,
where as before it was flaccid.

Patient improved neurologically, was seen by physical therapy
and occupational therapy and found to require acute
rehabilitation prior to discharge to home.  He was stable
from a cardiac standpoint throughout his hospital stay.  He
was awake, alert, moving the left side spontaneously.  The
right side had increased tone and did move to pain.

He was in stable condition at the time of discharge.

Medications at time of discharge:  Zantac 150 mg/G tube [**Hospital1 **],
digoxin 0.125/G tube q day, nystatin oral suspension 5 cc po
qid, Lipitor 20 mg/G tube q day, lisinopril 20 mg/G tube q
day, metoprolol 75 mg/G tube tid, insulin was on per sliding

At the time of discharge, will be transferred to
rehabilitation.  Will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] with repeat
head CT scan in two weeks' time.
