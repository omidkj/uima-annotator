Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU due to her vent dependence
although she was hemodynacmically stable in the ED.  In the ICU,
she was transfused 2 units of PRBC's and her HCT was stable at
27 over the remaining hospital stay.  She did not have any more
melanotic or guiaic positive stools after her first admission
day.

She was started on Cipro for her UTI and GI consult recommended
an outpatient scope and pill endoscopy, as her EGD was
unrevealing.  She had a previous hospitalization for GI bleeding
last year with no known cause at discharge.

While in the ICU she was kept on her previous vent settings of
AC 18, TV 500, FiO2 40 and PEEP 5.

She was discharged back to [**Hospital3 672**] in stable condition.
