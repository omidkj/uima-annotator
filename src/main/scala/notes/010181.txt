CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cardiac and respiratory arrest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55 year-old
woman with a history of type 1 diabetes who was in his usual

showed junctional rhythm, but he was pulseless.  He was

route.  He was taken to [**Hospital6 33**] and stabilized
with vital signs in normal sinus rhythm at 62, 165/75, 99%
intubated.  The patient was extubated and then transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for emergent cardiac
catheterization.  He was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 27686**]
cardiothoracic surgery team.

Respiratory rate 20.  96% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  Pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular

rhythm with 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.  He has rales a
third of the way up from the bases of his lungs bilaterally.
His abdomen is obese, nontender, no masses.  1+ pedal edema.
alert and oriented times three with nonfocal neurological
examination.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 16.3,
hematocrit 38, platelets 159, sodium 139, potassium 4.1,
chloride 100, bicarbonate 27, BUN 14, creatinine 0.9, glucose
217, ALT 30, AST 16, alkaline phosphatase 105, T bili 0.6.
CKs were 71, 68, 64 and 85.  Urinalysis was negative.
Transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2141-3-16**] showed a left
ventricular function of 55%, 1+ MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 109**] of 2.2 cm squared.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the
Cardiology Service at [**Hospital1 69**]
and underwent cardiac catheterization, which was significant
for mid right coronary artery 30% stenosis, right posterior
descending coronary artery 80% stenosis, right posterior and
lateral 99% stenosis, proximal left anterior descending
coronary artery 80% stenosis, diagonal one 90% stenosis,
intermediate 80% stenosis, anterolateral hypokinesis and EF
of 70%.  He underwent a spiral CT, which ruled out a PE.  He
was placed on heparin GTT.  On hospital day number two the
patient went to the Operating Room and underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft times two with grafts of left internal
mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary
artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal.  He
tolerated this procedure well.  He was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on a propofol drip,
intubated.  Postoperatively, the patient was agitated in the
unit and required extended sedation.  Hemodynamically he was
stable and A paced.  He was weaned off drips, weaned to
extubation that night of surgery without incident.  His blood
glucose remained in the 300 to 400 range.  He was placed on
an insulin drip.

Overnight the patient required face mask and nasal cannula to
maintain saturation.  He produced rusty brown sputum,
question aspiration status post arrest and CPR and was
started on Levaquin.  His respiratory status continued to
improve with aggressive chest physiotherapy.  Chest tubes
were removed without incident.  The patient remained stable
overnight and on postoperative day two was transferred to the
floor.

On the floor the patient continued to remain on face mask
nasal cannula to maintain O2 saturations.  He was started on
Albuterol, Atrovent MDI nebulizer treatments.  The patient
diuresed with good effect.  The patient has maintained nasal
cannula with appropriate O2 sats.  Chest x-ray demonstrated
large left sided effusion and ultrasound guided pleural tap
was performed on postoperative day number three with 200 cc
of serosanguinous drainage removed.  The patient reported
symptomatic relief.

He was also transferred to the floor on an insulin drip.
[**Last Name (un) **] consult obtained who closely monitored and treated his
elevated finger stick blood glucoses levels.  Oral
hypoglycemics have been discontinued and the patient has been
started on NPH and Humalog sliding scale.  Currently finger
sticks are in the 200 to 250 range.

On postoperative day number three on the floor the patient
developed rapid atrial fibrillation with blood pressures in
the 110s.  He was treated with Lopressor 25 mg intravenous,
Amiodarone 150 mg intravenous bolus, magnesium sulfate 2
grams and 20 mg of Diltiazem.  He was placed on an Amiodarone
drip and Dil trip.  By the afternoon the patient was
converted to sinus rhythm.  Drips were weaned.  The patient
was started on po Amiodarone 400 mg po t.i.d. and continued
on Lopressor.  He remained in normal sinus rhythm with a
stable blood pressure.

The patient was evaluated by the EP Service and underwent an
EP study.  The study showed a normal AVCS, junction rhythm
was sinus and no VT and no need for AICD.  The patient had
bed side TTE, which showed an EF of 55%.

Physical therapy consult determined that the patient will
need rehab postop.  The patient had been ambulating with
assist postoperatively.  The patient continued to remain
stable, afebrile and hemodynamically stable and is now ready
for discharge.

1.  Cardiac and respiratory arrest secondary to coronary
artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times
two.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus type 1.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hyperlipidemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Lopressor 25 mg po q.d., Lipitor
