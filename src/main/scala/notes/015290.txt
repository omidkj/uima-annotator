Chief Complaint:
hypoxemic resp failure

intubation
right picc placement
left femoral central line placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year-old man with a history of T3N1 fully
differentiated esphageal cancer diagnosed earlier this year,
diabetes type II and asthma admitted from [**Date range (1) 63688**] (earlier
today) at [**Hospital1 18**] for two orthopedic spine procedures after fall
with head trauma and c-spine injury, bilateral lower ext
weakness w/parasthesias and difficulty handeling secretions. He
was transferred from NEH on [**8-28**] on steroid drip and on [**8-30**]
he had Anterior fusion from C4-C7, anterior partial
vertebrectomy of C5, C6, C7, anterior discectomies C4-5, C5-6,
C6-7, anterior instrumentation C4-C7, structural allograft.  On
[**9-1**] she then had 1.  Total laminectomy of C3, C4, C5, C6,
fusion C4-C7, autograft, excision of soft tissue mass in the
posterior cervical region.  His post-op course was complicated
by desats requiring intubation with extubation on [**9-3**], crit
drop responsive to transfusion, pneumonia with GNR-serratia and
GPC not identified, frank aspiration necessitating feeding tube
placement by IR, poor urine output.
Discharge information limited, history unobtainable from
patient.
..
Patient was taken to rehab on morning of admission and upon
arrival felt inappropriate for admission there based on oxygen
requirement-desats, ambulance sent back to [**Hospital1 18**] ER.  In ER,
initially alert and oriented, able to answer appropriate
questions-significant secretions 2+strength in ue and 3+
strength in le.  Patient with desats on 6 liters of oxygen,
ultimately intubated in OR by anasthesia with surgical back-up
given recent cervical surgeries and posterior hematoma.
..
In OR, successfully intubated, patient given 1 of versed, 80 of
propofol and was obtunded on arrival to MICU.  Also with
transient hypotension requiring neosynephrine pushes.

CT spine:
Interval C3 through C7 anterior spinal fusion and laminectomy
with development of a postoperative hematoma in the region of
the laminectomy. There does not appear to be evidence of cord
compression, however, evaluation of the thecal sac is limited
due to overlying streak artifact from the orthopedic hardware.

CXR: Continued consolidation/collapse of the left lower lobe
with a small left pleural effusion. Linear atelectasis within
the right lung base.

CT torso:
1. A 2.4-cm mass in the mid to lower esophagus consistent with
patient's known esophageal carcinoma with periesophageal
lymphadenopathy and left paraaortic lymphadenopathy.
2. 10 mm hypodense lesion in the right adrenal, which likely
corresponds to the FDG-avid area on the PET CT of [**2120-6-24**].
3. Hypodense lesion in the left lobe of the liver, which is too
small to characterize.
4. Multiple small pulmonary nodules in the right middle lobe,
which are less than 5 mm and a followup CT should be performed
in three months given history of esophageal cancer.
5. Bibasilar atelectasis with bilateral tiny effusions.
6. Coronary artery calcifications.

CT neck:
Stable size of hematomas in the laminectomy bed and in the
posterior subcutaneous soft tissues compared to [**2120-9-6**].

U/S lower extremities:
Stable size of hematomas in the laminectomy bed and in the
posterior subcutaneous soft tissues compared to [**2120-9-6**].

CT head:
Stable size of hematomas in the laminectomy bed and in the
posterior subcutaneous soft tissues compared to [**2120-9-6**].

U/S: Right brachial vein thrombosis.

Echocardiogram: The left atrium is normal in size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Views are
technically suboptimal for assessment of regurgitation .

EKG: Probable sinus tachycardia with multiple atrial premature
complexes - may be multifocal atrial tachycardia Ventricular
premature complex
Modest nonspecific low amplitude T waves. Since previous tracing
of [**2120-9-8**], atrial ectopy present.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 y/o man with history of metastatic esophageal cancer,
diabetes, asthma discharged today from ortho spine service after
cervical surgeries leading to ultimate fusion of multiple
cervical vertebrae after fall and fracture of same on [**8-28**],
re-admitted with hypoxemic resp failure.  He was initially
trated with vancomycin and aztreonam which was changed to
levofloxacin on [**9-9**] for sputum Serratia and gram+ cocci
pneumonia and left lower lobe collapse.  Levofloxacin was then
DC'd along with Aztreonam and pt was put on vancomycin to
complete a 14 day
