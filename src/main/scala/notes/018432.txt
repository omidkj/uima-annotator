Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the TSICU and monitored closely.  His
thoracic/lumbar spine was cleared in order to attempt
extubation. He was febrile on admission and blood, urine and
sputum cultures were obtained. Urine cultures were negative and
sputum gram stain showed 1+ GPC's and he was started on
levofloxacin and completed 5 day course.
  He was safely extubated on [**11-10**] without difficulty and was
kept in the ICU overnight for continued observation and neuro
checks. He did complain of burning sensation in his RUE and was
started on neurontin 300mg three times daily which was then
further increased to 600mg TID. His physical exam at this time
was full strength in LLE, RLE weakness 2/5 proximally and [**4-29**]

this can be titrated slowly to off as it resolves.
