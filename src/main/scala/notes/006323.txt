CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nonhealing ischemic left foot ulceration.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient underwent diagnostic
arteriogram on [**2141-2-8**] which demonstrated mild iliac
disease, occlude left SFA with reconstitution with a below-
knee [**Doctor Last Name **] which is diseased, and disease tibioperoneal trunk
and occluded posterior tibial artery with a widely patent DP,
and incomplete arch. Recommendations: The patient would
require a left common femoral to DP bypass. The patient was
discharged to home and returns for elective surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of ischemic heart disease
status post myocardial infarction, status post CABG in [**2131**]
complicated by sternal wound infection, pulmonary embolus and
sepsis, history of asthma, COPD, history of type 2 diabetes
with neuropathy--insulin dependent, history of hypothyroid
disease, history of hiatal hernia with reflux, history of
tobacco use which is current, history of hyperlipidemia,
postoperative blood loss anemia--transfuse corrected.

ALLERGIES:  Include Bactrim, captopril, ACE inhibitors and
Alphagan ophthalmic drops--manifestations unknown.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.,
isosorbide 20 mg t.i.d., NPH insulin 20 units q. a.m. and 16
units at dinner, Lipitor 40 mg once daily, Diovan 80 mg once
daily, Plavix 75 mg once daily, folic acid 1 mg once daily,
Lasix 40 mg b.i.d.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for right extremity
bypass graft, breast reduction and a TMA on the right.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a current tobacco user.
Denies alcohol or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vital signs are stable. General appearance is
alert, cooperative white female in no acute distress. Neck is
supple. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart is a regular
rate and rhythm. Abdominal exam is unremarkable. Extremities
shows a right TMA well-healed. The left foot is cool with an
ulcer on the heel and forefoot. Pulse exam shows palpable
femorals bilateral. On the right, DP and PT were palpable. On
the left, the DP was Dopplerable, and the PT was Dopplerable.
The brachial pulses are palpable bilaterally. Neurological
exam is unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2141-4-27**]. She underwent a
left common femoral to anterior tibial bypass with PTFE
secondary to limited vein conduit. She tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in stable
condition. She had a Dopplerable AT at the end of the
procedure. Immediately postoperatively, she remained
hemodynamically stable. Her wounds were clean, dry and
intact. She continued to do well and was transferred to the
VICU for continued monitoring and care.

Postoperative day 1, she continued on low dose heparin. Her
exam remained unchanged. Her diet was advanced. Her fluids
were Hep-Locked. Her heparin was continued in therapeutic
ranges for goal PTT between 50 and 60. She remained on
bedrest and in the VICU.

Postoperative day 2, the patient had a low-grade temperature
of 100.0-99.4. Incentive spirometry was encouraged. The foot
was examined. It was a warm foot with a Dopplerable graft and
DP pulse. Diuresis was continued. The patient's hematocrit
was 26.8. She was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood
cells. Ambulation to a chair was begun.

Postoperative day 3, the patient was started on Coumadin the
night before. Her Lopressor dosing was required to be
adjusted for continued systolic hypertension. Her A-line was
removed. Her post-transfusion crit was 29.5. She had a
Dopplerable graft and a warm foot. The Percocet controlled
her pain. Lasix was continued. Her heparin drip was
discontinued for her INR of 2.4. She was evaluated by
physical therapy who recommended that the patient would
require rehab.

She will be discharged to rehab when bed available. INR
should be monitored on a daily basis to maintain goal INR
between 2.0 and 3.0. Once in a steady therapeutic state, INR
should be measured twice a week and thereafter monthly.
Patient should follow-up with her primary care physician upon
discharge from rehab for continuing monitoring of her INR.
Dressings to the wound were dry sterile dressings. She should
wear an Ace from foot to knee when ambulating. She may
ambulate full weightbearing essential distances. She should
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in 2 weeks time for skin clip
removal.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Acetaminophen 325 mg tablets [**11-21**] q. 4-

[**2-23**] h. p.r.n., folic acid 1 mg daily, quetiapine 100 mg 5
