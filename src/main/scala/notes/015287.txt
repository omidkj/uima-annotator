Admission Date:  [**2185-3-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-3-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**2131-12-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  NEUROMEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53 year-old
woman with a history of obesity, hypertension and high
cholesterol who developed a right hemiparesis and dysarthria
at around 5:00 p.m. on [**3-17**].  She was at home, fell down and
called EMS and was taken to an outside hospital.  At the
outside hospital her head CT showed no evidence of bleeding,
but her blood pressure was 340/140, so no tissue plasminogen
activator was given.  She was med flighted to [**Hospital1 346**] around 10:00 p.m.  At that time her
NIH drug scale was 12.  She was started on labetalol drip for
her continually high blood pressure.  MRI showed a diffusion
abnormalities in the left internal capsule and left carina
radiata.  MRA was too degraded by motion artifact to
interpret.  Because her blood pressure remained continually
high she was not given tissue plasminogen activator.  She was
transferred to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for blood
pressure monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Uncontrolled hypertension.
2.  High cholesterol.
3.  Obesity.
4.  Status post cholecystectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies tobacco use.  She lives with her
husband.  They have been married for 38 years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.3.  Blood
pressure 200/100.  Pulse 78.  Sating well on room air.
Generally she was lying in bed, sedated slightly on Ativan,
but does move and moan when intravenous access manipulated.
The patient is able to say her name and [**Month (only) 205**].  She can show
her left fist.  She was unable to move the right side.  She
was able to touch the right ear with the left hand.  She had
dysarthric speech.  Her extraocular movements full.  Pupils
were reactive.  She had a right facial droop.  She was able
to raise the left arm and squeeze with the right hand, able
to move the left leg, withdraws appropriately on the left and
has a triple flexion response with the right leg on
examination.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 13.6, hematocrit 35.8,
platelets 414, sodium 138, potassium 4.2, BUN 13, creatinine
0.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was observed in the Neuro
Medical Intensive Care Unit for several days while her blood
pressure remained out of control.  She required a Nipride
drip eventually.  She was weaned off Nipride and sent to the
floor.  She had a carotid ultrasound, which showed no
stenosis in either carotid artery.  She had a repeat MRI
scan, which showed old pontine lacune and also evidence of an
infarction and the posterior lateral left thalamus.  She had
a transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed an ejection
fraction over greater then 50%, mildly dilated right atrium
and left atrium and mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and moderate
pulmonary artery hypertension.  There was no AST or PFO seen.
She continued to have elevated blood pressures on the floor
despite intravenous Hydralazine with blood pressures into the
220s systolic, so she was transferred back to the Intensive
Care Unit for more intensive blood pressure control.  While
she was there she had a swallowing evaluation, which showed
that she could take a diet of nectar thick liquids and soft
moist solids, no thin liquids and no mixed consistencies.

The patient while she was in the Intensive Care Unit had
evaluation for other causes of her uncontrolled hypertension.
 She had a renal artery ultrasound, which showed patent
bilateral renal vessels with no renal masses, calculi or
hydronephrosis.  She then had an MRA of the kidneys, which
again showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis.  She
underwent a 24 hour urine collection for evaluation for
evidence of pheochromocytoma.  The results are still pending
at this time.  Her blood pressure was again stabilized and
she was transferred back to the floor.  On the floor she was
maintained on multiple medications including Metoprolol,
Captopril, Hydralazine, Norvasc was then added as well as
Hydrochlorothiazide and she eventually achieved blood
pressure control.  She continued to have severe dysarthria as
well as severe weakness of her right upper and lower
extremities.  Eventfully after her blood pressure controlled
she was stable for discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Infarction of the posterior limb of the left internal
capsule, left thalamus.
2.  Uncontrolled hypertension.
3.  Obesity.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to rehab.
