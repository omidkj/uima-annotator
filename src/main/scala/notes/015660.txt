SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 66 year-old man with a history of COPD, AAA, and
HTN, recently discharged on [**2131-10-12**] after presenting with strep
pneumonia requiring intubation, who presents with worsening
dyspnea and is admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress.
.
He was in his USOH until three days ago when he developed a
cough productive of yellow/green sputum, dyspnea, and pleuritic
left chest pain. His symptoms progressively worsened and he
presented to the ED for evaluation.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: 98.0 122 174/85 16 92%ra.
Exam was notable for the absence of wheezes and a CXR was read
as interval improvement in previously present bibasilar
infiltrates. He was also complaining of pleuritic left chest
pain. He was given ceftriaxone/azithro, albuterol/atrovent nebs,
solumedrol 125 and placed on CPAP for tachypnea and concern that
he was tiring. BiPap settings prior to transfer were fio2 60%
and 15/5 with the most recent ABG 7.33/40/216.
.

CXR [**11-27**]
IMPRESSION: Marked interval improvement in previous pattern of
patchy
bibasilar opacities. Minimal residual linear opacities within
the left mid
lung field may represent the residual of prior infection. No new
areas of
focal consolidation seen. Severe emphysema.

CXR [**11-29**]:

HISTORY: Emphysema. Recent pneumonia. Readmitted with dyspnea.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs
since [**2129**],
most recently [**11-27**] and 6:

Coarse interstitial abnormality in the left lower lung has
worsened
accompanied by increase in small left pleural effusion and
hypervascularity of the left lung. The patient has severe
emphysema, which is likely to make an otherwise easily
recognizable process difficult to diagnose. Therefore, even
though heart is normal size and the right lower lung is
relatively clear; there is enough possibility that this is
asymmetric pulmonary edema. The patient should be treated with
that in mind in addition to receiving antibiotics dictated by
clinical circumstances. There is also coarsening of
bronchiectasis and scarring in the right lung apex, which has
progressed since [**11-27**]. Rather than ascribing this to a
second concurrent infection such as tuberculosis, it could be
another focus of asymmetric pulmonary edema.

CHEST X-RAY [**12-2**]

HISTORY: Short of breath, possible volume overload or pneumonia.


PA AND LATERAL VIEWS: Comparison with previous study done
[**2131-11-29**]. The lungs are hyperexpanded consistent with COPD as
before. There is scattered
parenchymal scarring as demonstrated previously most pronounced
in the upper lobes. Coarse interstitial markings are again noted
on the left. Compared with the previous study, these coarsened
interstitial markings appear slightly less prominent. There is
no new, focal infiltrate. The heart is normal in size. The aorta
is calcified. Mediastinal structures are unchanged. Orthopedic
hardware is again demonstrated in the thoracolumbar spine.

IMPRESSION:
Interval improvement in coarse interstitial markings in the
lower left lung. No other significant change.

ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Aortic valve sclerosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 year-old man with emphysema, AAA, HTN, and recent PNA who
presented with dyspnea.

1. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, with CHF exacerbation and
exacerbation of severe COPD: Dyspnea in the context of
leukocytosis and recent severe pneumonia requiring intubation
initially felt to be hospital acquired pneumonia and he was
treated for this. His sputum cultures were unrevealing and his
white count trended down. Antibiotics were narrowed to just
levofloxacin and he was also treated with prednisone and
nebulizers. Chest xray was read as possible asymmetric pulmonary
edema, and a BNP was sent and it was elevated at around 2550. He
was diuresed about 2 liters and a repeat che
