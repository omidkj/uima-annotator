Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Company 1543**] DDD Sensia pacemaker placement via cephalic vein


History of Present Illness:
81 yo M w/ HTN, HL, DM type 1 (A1C 9.4%), bladder cancer,
dementia and long standing history of RBBB/LAFB who now presents
to the ED with weakness and malaise, found to be in CHB but
asymptomatic, now being transferred to CCU for observation after
another episode lasting 30 mins w/ 6 sec. pause s/p R
transcutaneous pacer.
.
Pt was in USOH until afternoon of the day of admission, when
after eating lunch, he noted a sensation of nearly passing out.
He sat down with some improvement in sx.  Thereafter, he reports
feeling generalized weakness and fatigue.  He returned home and
continued to have similar sensation of near faintness.  After
three more similar episodes and continuing to feel ill after
laying flat, EMS was called.  His wife notes that over the past
2mo or so, he has reported occasional sx of vision going
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]/black intermittently, lasting seconds with a sensation of
lightheadedness.  He has not had frank syncope, no hx of
seizures.  No CP, SOB, though does note feelings of SOB when
laying flat, that improves with clearing of his nose.  At times
reports awakening from SOB, that also improves w/ clearing of
his nose.  He has chronic nasal congestion.  No recent med
changes.
.
Upon arrival, his BP was wnl by report and HR was noted to be
30-40s, with high degree AV block.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
where upon arrival he was noted to have a conversion to his
usual rhythm spontaneously, SR w/ RBBB/LAFB, however within ~
1hr, was found to be again in 3:1 AV block.  This presented with
an asymptomatic six second pause.  Due to recurrence, he
underwent R temporary pacer wire placement in the ED and prior
to completion of placement, he converted to SR again.  At time
of transfer, his VS were HR 72, BP 161/78, RR10, 95-98%RA.  He
received only fentanyl/midaz for sedation. Labs and imaging
significant for Cr of 1.3 and an unremarkable CXR.
.
In the CCU, VS were 60 157/64 12 96% RA.  He c/o of a right
sided HA w/o vision changes.   Per fellow, pacer was
intermittenly capturing at 5 amps.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains.  He has intermittent
cough.  No recent fevers, chills or rigors. No exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

MICROBIOLOGY: none

OTHER STUDIES:
EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Right
bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2157-3-23**] the frequent
ventricular ectopy is no longer appreciated.

IMAGING:
CXR on admission: FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable chest
radiograph is obtained. Multiple
overlying wires are noted which somewhat limit the evaluation,
though allowing
for this, there is no focal consolidation, effusion, or
pneumothorax. No
signs of congestive heart failure. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
appears
stable with atherosclerotic calcifications at the aortic knob.
Bony
structures are intact.

IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
.
TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in
the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR (prior to discharge): FINDINGS: In comparison with study of
[**4-27**], there is no interval change in the appearance of the heart
and lungs or the pacemaker device. Mild atelectatic changes are
seen, especially at the left base.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo M w/ HTN, HL, DM type 1, bladder cancer, dementia and long
standing history of RBBB/LAFB who now presents to the ED with
weakness and malaise, found to be in CHB but asymptomatic,
transferred to CCU for observation after another episode lasting
30 mins w/ 6 second pause, now s/p dual chamber pacemaker
placement.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
.
# High degree AV block.  Likely infra-AV nodal block, at times
it seems to be 1:3 but not consistently so, it appears
paroxysmal given spontanous conversions.  On one telemetry strip
he is noted to go into block s/p a VPC with no escape rhythm
with a pause of ~ 6 seconds.  Given high degree AV block, IJV
pacer wire was placed, that captured at 5amps w/ a back up rate
of 50.  Etiology of this is uncertain, but likely related to
chronically diseased conduction system (given RBBB/LAFB he was
already at high risk of high degree AVB).  He is on no nodal
agents abd electrolytes wnl.  His sx are most likely due to
block and appear to have been going on for at least a couple of
months (no signs to suggest seizure or posterior circulation
disease).  He was monitored on telemetry, with temporary pacer
set at 50bpm, occasionally kicking in.  He was taken by the
Electrophysiology service for a dual-chamber pacemaker placement
without complications.  He
