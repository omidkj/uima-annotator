Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
74-year-old woman who presented in [**2162-7-10**] to [**Hospital1 18**] c/o
severe pleuritic chest pain. CT revealed small pericardial
effusion. She has had multiple echocardiograms, most recently on
[**2163-2-21**], showing a moderate-sized pericardial effusion
with fluid consistent with blood or inflammation. She has never
had any evidence of tamponade, pericardiocentesis was considered
in [**2161**] for diagnostic purposes, though it was felt there was
not enough fluid to tap at that time. She has had multiple
episodes of shortness of breath, over the past several months
and has developed chronic dyspnea on exertion. Also c/o lower
extremity edema, worse on her right leg. Treated periodically
with Lasix with some improvement in both breathing and lower
extremity edema. Recently cardiac MRI consistent with
constrictive pericarditis with a large pericardial effusion and
large right-sided pleural effusion.

Pertinent Results:
[**2163-8-29**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated and
elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is small with mild depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is a large pericardial effusion with significant,
accentuated respiratory variation in mitral valve inflow,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling. There are large
bilateral pleural effusions. At the end of the procedure, the
pericardial effusion is gone and the pleural effusions are
decreased substantially. Trace aortic regurgitation, trace
mitral regurgitation, and trace trcuspid regurgitation persist.

Final Report
HISTORY: Pericardiectomy with chest tube removal, to assess for
pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-27**], the right PICC
line has been
repositioned with its tip in the region of the mid portion of
the SVC. Right
chest tube has been removed and there is a small apical
pneumothorax. The
overall appearance of the heart and lungs is essentially
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a same day admit after undergoing preoperative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**8-29**] she was brought directly to
the operating room where she underwent a total pericardiectomy.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. She
continued to have significant issues with right heart function
and rising creatinine with decreased urine output. She required
multiple pressors and inotropy to support her cardiogenic shock.
On POD #2 TTE confirmed right heart failure, depressed function
and she was reintubated for airway and hemodynamic support. She
was taken to the cath lab for a Tandem Heart RVAD. On [**2163-9-1**]
she had cardiac arrest which responded to epinephrine and CPR.
She remained anuric and was started on CVVH for postoperative
acute renal failure. Electrophysiolgy was consulted for
tachy-brady arrhythmias. It was deemed not necessary for a
temporary screw in pacer. Social work was consulted for family
coping issues. The remainder of her postoperative course was
quite complicated and will be broken down by systems.

Neurologically: She was kept sedated and paralyzed while
utilizing the RVAD. A sedation induced encephalopathy occurred.
As she continued to progress her mental status improved and she
cleared until back to her baseline. She was alert and oriented
at the time of discharge and taking only Tylenol for pain.

Cardiac: Pressor and inotropic support were weaned and explant
of the RVAD occurred on [**2163-9-6**]. She remained on and off
pressors after the RVAD was explanted due to cardiogenic shock
and sepsis. Her rhythm remained in a normal sinus or sinus
tachycardia. She was started on Midodrine 10 mg PO TID and this
was slowly weaned to 5 mg TID in order to assist in weaning off
Neosynephrine.

Pulmonary: Due to extensive volume infusion for cardiac support
and nutrition, a prolonged intubation was needed until enough
volume was removed via CVVH. [**2163-9-18**] she was extubated
successfully. Chest tube drainage and an airleak kept the chest
tubes in for a longer duration. They were discontinued when
criteria was met.  Right pleural was pulled [**2163-9-27**] once
drainage was minimal.

GI:Nutritional support via total parenteral nutrition was
utilized. As she progressed, it was weaned off and tube feeds
were utilized. Nutrition was consulted for daily recommendations
regarding her caloric needs and the most efficient way to
provide them to her. [**2163-9-20**] a speech and swallow evaluation
was performed to evaluate for dysphagia secondary to a prolonged
length of intubation and she pass
