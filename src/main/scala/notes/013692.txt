Chief Complaint:
Jaw Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-29**]: Cardiac catheterization

[**3-30**]: Transthoracic [**Month/Year (2) **]

History of Present Illness:
82 year old female with hx of Diabetes Mellitus II diet
controlled transferred from OSH with STEMI. Patient states that
yesterday evening she developed jaw pain. She admits to having
had jaw pain once 6 years ago and was told by her PCP that it
was 'angina'. She was given pills (nitroglycerin?) but decided
to take herbal medications instead, [**Location (un) 42317**] extract. She had
no subsequent events until yesterday. She was getting ready to
take a shower when she developed the jaw pain yesterday. She was
worried as it was similar to her previous 'angina' episode and
went to the ED. Her pain was associated with diaphoresis. She
denies chest pain, DOE, SOB, N/V, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND
or ankle swelling.
.
Patient was seen at [**Hospital3 2737**] for evaluation of her jaw
pain. EKG's were notable for STEMI. She was given ASA 81mg x 4,
NTG, Lopressor IV, Plavix 600mg x 1, Heparin gtt and transferred
here for cardiac catheterization which was notable for
thrombotic occlusion distally of OM2 without collaterals and
received PTCA of the OM2. No stent was placed. By report she
developed hypotension and VT while in the cath lab. However,
there is no documentation of this event. She was transferred to
the CCU for further management.
.
On arrival to the CCU the patient was chest pain free. She
denies any SOB, N/V, diaphoresis or palpitations.

[**2118-3-29**] Cardiac Catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated
single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA and LAD had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LCx had a
thrombotic occlusion of the distal OM2 without collaterals.  The
RCA had
mild luminal irregularities.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with a RVEDP of 14 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 23 mmHg.
There was
mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 40/20
mmHg.
There was mild systemic arterial hypertension with a central
aortic
pressure of 154/65 mmHg.  The cardiac index was normal at 2.8
L/min/m2.
3. Successful PTCA of the upperpole of the second obtuse
marginal.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent
dissection.
There was TIMI III flow at the PTCA site.  However, there was a
distal
cut-off at the upper pole of the OM2. The lower pole of the
second
obtuse marginal remained totally occluded (See PTCA comments).
4. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with
a 6F
Angioseal closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
5. Acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction managed by acute
PTCA
to the upper pole of the obtuse marginal.
.
[**2118-3-30**] TTE:
Finding: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with distal lateral hypokinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 82 year old female (Jehovah's witness) with history
of Diabetes Mellitus Type II diet controlled who presents from
OSH with STEMI, now s/p cardiac catheterization with PCTA of
OM2.

Hospital course as outlined by problem below:

# CAD/Ischemia:  Patient was admitted with STEMI to Obtuse
Marginal 2 artery as above.  Her presenting symptom was jaw
pain.  She was taken for cardiac catheterization and balloon
angioplasty was performed.  No stent was placed as this would
necessitate long-term anticoagulation.  Given the patient's
desire to avoid possible blood transfusions if necessary
(Jehovah's witness), it was decided to not place a stent in this
patient.  Upon arrival to the floor, the patient had persistent
chest pain with deep inspiration.  Her cardiac enzymes did not
rise and repeated ECG showed no signs of ischemia.  The chest
pain was alleviated with Tylenol and began to subside by
hospital day 3.  She was started on Aspirin 325mg daily, Toprol
XL 100mg daily, Atorvastatin 80mg daily, Lisinopril 2.5mg daily
and Nitroglycerin 0.3mg SL PRN.

# Rhythm:  Upon completion of the catheterization procedure, the
patient reportedly developed ventricular tachycardia and
hypotension.  She was stabilized and transferred to the CCU for
further care.  The patient developed a tachyarrythmia to the
120/130's on hospital day 2 thought to represent atrial
tachycardia.  She was initially treated with diltiazem without
resolution of tachyarrhythmia.  Carotid massage was unsuccessful
in breaking the arrhytmia.  She developed some hypotension with
diltiazem and therefore, diltiazem was titrated down and the
patient was started on increasing doses of metoprolol.  Her
arrhythmia was eventually controlled with metoprolol and
returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm.  She was discharged on Toprol
XL as above.

# Pump: No history of CHF.  Post-MI [**Location **] on [**2118-3-30**] showed LVEF
55% with mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with distal
lateral hypokinesis.  She was continued on Metoprolol and
Lisinopril as above.

# Valves: 1+MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 113**] ([**2118-3-30**])

# Anemia:  Upon presentation the patient had a normocytic anemia
of unknown origen.  Her hematocrit at the outside hospital was
29.  Post catheterization her hematocrit was 23.4 without
obvious signs of bleeding.  The following morning her hematocrit
was stable and her catheterization site showed no evidence of
hematoma or large ecchymosis.  Iron, B12 and folate studies were
all within normal limits.  No further blood draws were obtained
as assessment would not have changed management, as pt refused
the possibility of transfusion.  She denied BRBPR or melena and
reported that she had never had a colonoscopy.  Given her
continued anemia, she should have a screening colonoscopy for
evaluation.  This should be followed by her PCP.

# DM: diet controlled at home.  Poor control while inpatient so
sliding scale insulin increased.  HbA1c 7.1 ([**2118-3-30**]).  Diabetes
should be followed by her PCP as an outpatient.
