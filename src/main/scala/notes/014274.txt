Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins / Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8747**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for junctional bradycardia, history of Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with h/o CAD, PAF who was in her USOH until 2
weeks PTA when she experienced an episode of chest pain, for
which she presented to [**Hospital 26580**] Hospital and was noted to be in
AF. She was started on amiodarone/digoxin and d/ced home.  She
was doing well at home until [**2164-10-30**] (2 days ago) when she
re-presented to [**Hospital3 **] following an episode of chest
pain. She reports that she awoke at 6 a.m. with dull/heavy
central chest pain, non-radiating, associated with coughing/mild
shortness of breath and LH. No associated N/V, diaphoresis. She
took one SLNTG with some improvement. EMS gave her an ASA and
another SLNTG. In the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], she received 1 inch of NTP with
complete resolution of symptoms. EKG showed nonspecific STTW
abnormalities and she was admitted for further management.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled with max TnI 0.5 (upper limit of
normal 0.4). Given INR was 3, she was not started on heparin
gtt. Today, HCT 25.9 (from 28) and she was transfused 1uPRBC. On
[**10-31**], she became LH and mildly nauseas, no chest pain/pressure,
she was noted to be in a junctional rhythm, HR 45, bp 114/68 and
she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  Her
amiodarone, digoxin, cardizem were held upon transfer and on
presentation to ED she had reverted back to NSR with HR in the
60's.  She was CP free on arrival with resolution of her
symptoms of LH, nausea.
Of note, she reports that besides the similar episode of chest
pain 2 weeks ago, She reports that she has had intermittent
chest pain for the last 2-3 months, occurring 3-5 times a week
when walking [**12-11**] block, or walking around her house.  These
episodes of chest pain are relieved with rest. She denies LE
edema or PND. She sleeps on 2 pillows a night, due to back
discomfort rather than true orthopnea.
.
Currently, she denies chest pain, nausea/vomiting,
lightheadedness, diaphoresis.
.
ROS: No fever, headache, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, sputum
production, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, diarrhea/constipation
(last BM yesterday). No BRBPR, although she notes that her stool
has been dark since starting iron. (+) occasional chills and
decreased appetite since being started on amiodarone and dig.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after developing junctional rhythm at
OSH. By the time she got here, she was in NSR.  The first part
of her hospitalization involved close blood pressure control,
management of her mild CHF, evaluation of her anemia, evaluation
for an elevated WBC count(resolved), and evaluation/treatment of
her intermittment chest pain.  As the pain was felt to be a
direct result of coronary disease, the patient was taken to
cardiac catheterization.  She had three vessel disease. A stent
was placed in the left circumflex artery and soon afterwards,
she became less responsive, hemiparetic, and aphasic.  She was
evaluated by the acute stroke team immediately and felt to have
an embolic occlusion of the left MCA.
A CT scan showed no evidence of bleeding.  A extensive
discussion was held among the stroke team, interventional
radiology, cardiology, and her sister and brother (available by
phone).  The family wanted to proceed with thrombolysis.  Both
IV and IA approaches were discussed.  However, since the patient
had received a direct thrombin inhibitor during the
catheterization, it was felt that IV t-[**MD Number(3) 32382**] pose a high risk
of bleeding.  The risks and benefits of IA t-PA were extensively
discussed with the family and they wanted to proceed with IA-tPA
and gave consent.  Angiography revealed an M1 occlusion which
did not open after t-PA was delivered to the thrombus.  She
tolerated the procedure well and had no complications from the
procedure. Repeat CT scan showed the question of a small amount
of petechial bleeding versus contrast.  After transfer to the
ICU, she had to be intubated for respiratory distress and
continued to do poorly.  An EEG ruled out seizure.  She did not
wake up despite being off all sedating medications.  Her vital
signs remained fairly stable, but she was not overbreathing the
ventilator. A repeat CT scan showed that she had infarcted the
entire distribution of the MCA.  She continued to be
unresponsive and a family meeting was held.  They decided to
consider making her CMO as her outlook was very poor.  On the
next day, she had pupillary asymmetry and a repeat scan showed
increased edema with significant midline shift and herniation.
At this time, her family decided to make her CMO. SHe was
extubated and expired several hours later.
