CXR: CHF
.
EKG: NSR. Nl axis. RBBB w/ secondary ST changes. TW flattening
V4-5. RBBB pattern seen on prior EKG dated [**2169-8-10**].
.
Head CT w/o contrast: No hemorrhage, mass, or shift of normally
midline structures.  No major vascular territorial infarct is
apparent.  A small right-sided subinsular white matter
hypodensity and periventricular hypodensities are noted and
correlates to findings from prior MRI scan from [**2169-10-2**],
and likely represent chronic changes secondary to small vessel
infarction. Calcifications are seen within the cavernous portion
of the internal carotid. The surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.
.
Renal U/S: Compared to CT of [**2169-8-10**].  Right kidney is somewhat
diminutive measuring 8.6 cm.  The left kidney is 9.9 cm.  There
is no
hydronephrosis nor focal renal lesions.  Again demonstrated is
the large
abdominal aneurysm, with extensive mural thrombus, measuring 6.2
cm in AP
dimension on the sagittal view and 5.6 x 6.0 cm on the
transverse views,
apparently not significantly changed from the CT of [**2169-8-10**].  No
free fluid seen in the retroperitoneum.
.
Echo:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Lipomatous
hypertrophy of the
interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV
wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Focal apical hypokinesis of
RV free wall.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.
Normal ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Minimally increased
gradient c/w minimal AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2160**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis
recommendations,
the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and
echocardiographic data. Echocardiographic results were reviewed
by telephone
with the houseofficer caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild-moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal with tivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2164-11-6**]
right ventricular cavity dilation and free wall hypokinesis are
identified c/w
ischemia. Mild aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation are
now
identified.

CXR [**11-15**]:
COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to [**2169-11-8**].

TECHNIQUE: AP upright and lateral views of the chest.

FINDINGS: There is a right PICC with tip in the upper SVC. The
cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable since the prior study.
The aorta is calcified and tortuous. There is interval
development of upper zone redistribution of the pulmonary
vascularity and peribronchial coughing suggesting mild CHF. The
bilateral hila are enlarged suggesting pulmonary artery
hypertension. There are bilateral pleural effusions. No overt
pulmonary edema is noted.

IMPRESSION: Mild CHF.
.
[**11-6**]
SINGLE VIEW, RIGHT SHOULDER, [**2169-11-6**].

COMPARISON:  None.

FINDINGS:  Single projection of the right shoulder was ordered
and obtained.
Please note, dislocations, particularly posterior, are difficult
to exclude
given single projection.

There is significant deformity of the proximal diaphysis of the
humerus from
remote fracture.  There is near complete obliteration of the
acromiohumeral
interval, which can be seen in chronic rotator cuff tear.  There
is
degenerative disease of the acromioclavicular joint noted.  The
regional soft
tissues are relatively unremarkable.  The visualized adjacent
lung is clear.

IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited study given single projection.  No
gross
traumatic lesion identified.  There is suggestion of chronic
rotator cuff tear and AC joint osteoarthritis.  Healed deformed
old fracture of the humerus is also evident.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypertensive emergency- The patient had elevated SBP to 200s
with respiratory distress and altered sensorium on admission.
She was managed acutely with nitro and lasix infusions in the
ER, dropping her SBP to the 130s. CT obtained before transfer
demonstrated no pulmo
