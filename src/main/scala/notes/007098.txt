Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
Carcinoma of the right upper lobe.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1. Right thoracotomy with sleeve upper lobectomy.
3. Flexible bronchoscopy with clearance of secretions.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a 74-year-old gentleman with biopsy-proven
squamous carcinoma of the left upper lobe. He had a negative
metastatic survey and underwent mediastinoscopy with no
pathologic findings one day prior to this admission. We
recommended sleeve upper lobectomy as he had adequate, but not
exceptional lung function. He agreed to proceed.

Past Medical History:
Significant for radiation for squamous carcinoma of the soft
palate. This was approximately 10 years ago, treated with
radiation therapy at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with no evidence of
recurrence to date. He also has a history of a lacunar infarct
and COPD.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient underwent the sleeve resection on [**2118-11-9**]. He was on
pressors briefly in the operating room but otherwise tolerated
the procedure well. Cardiac enzymes were flat post-op and the
patient's EKG was without ischemic changes. He received one unit
of blood on POD1 for Hct of 26 to which he responded well. Later
that same day the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation
and the senior house officer was called to the floor. Patient
was hemodynamically stable and converted back to NSR with 5mg IV
lopressor. He was also given magnesium and calcium gluconate
acutely and labs were sent. ABG was 7.27/46/151/22/-5. Patient
was confused at the time and his urine output remained
borderline throughout the night. The patient was not
anticoagulated given his recent surgery and presence of
epidural. Patient remained confused over the next several days,
and geriatrics medicine consult was obtained to help manage his
delerium and comorbid medical conditions. He had a hard time
clearing his secretions and flexible bronchoscopy was needed
several times over the following week as well as gentle
diuresis. On POD3 the patient was transferred to the SICU for
careful managment given his compromised respiratory status and
concern for need for possible intubation. He remained stable in
the ICU and after a repeat bronchoscopy was deemed stable enough
for transfer back to the floor the next day. Patient had brief
episodes of atrial fibrillation both while in the unit and once
transfered back to the floor which resolved with titration of
the beta blocker. The epidural and both chest tubes were removed
on POD4. Bedside swallow demonstrated the patient was at
significant risk for anpiration and tube feeds were started on
[**11-14**] with nutrution recommendations. As the patient's mental
status started to clear he was seen by physical therapy and
geriatrics medicine continued to follow, however he continued to
have difficulty clearing secretions and on [**11-16**] he was again
bronch'd after a chest x-ray demonstrated worsened atelectasis.
Intermittent diuresis combined with bronchoscopy as described
resulted in significant improvement in his pulmonary status.
Over the next several days his mental status cleared
significantly and he was increasingly mobile, ambulating with
assistance from PT. Rehabilitation screening had just begun when
patient's status took an unexpected downturn on the evening of
[**11-20**], unfortunately ending in death within an hour of the
initiation of events. The intern was called to bedside shortly
before midnight when the patient abruptly became severely
bradycardic upon returning to bed after a bowel movement. The
nurse called a code immediately and upon arrival to bedside the
patient was in PEA. The senior medical resident ran the code,
and the senior surgery resident arrived within 5 minutes after
being called into the hospital from home. Patient received
atropine, epinephrine and bicarbonate x4 with no response. ACLS
protocol continued to be followed as the patient's rhythm
deteriorated to ventricular fibrillation. After greater than
thirty minutes of attempted resuscitation the patient was
pronounced at approximately 1am. The senior surgery resident
discussed the case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**], who notified the family
immediately. Autopsy was declined.
