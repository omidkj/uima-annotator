years ago), DMII, Alzheimer's dementia, CVA (5.5 years ago) who
awoke this morning with desaturation to 70s on RA. Patient was
noted to be pale, cold and clammy, unclear if she experienced
chest pain given baseline dementia. Initial EKG with
anterolateral ST depressions, and later EKG showed ST elevations
in V1 - V3. In the ED, patient hypotensive to 70s necessitating
Levophed support.
.
Patient's daughter at bedside, gave history and served as
translator. Patient without complaints of chest pain, shortness
of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, though difficult
to assess given dementia. Daughter re-iterated that she does not

ECHO ([**2194-11-14**])
1. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis with some preservation of
lateral wall
motion. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
CXR:
A single portable AP upright view is compared to previous
examination of [**2194-11-11**]. Since the previous exam there
is partial resolution of the pulmonary edema. There are
bilateral pleural effusions. The heart size is mildly enlarged.
There is increased interstitial marking in right apex without
definite evidence of mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 83 year-old female with HTN, DMII, HL, CVA, CAD
who presented to the Emergency Department from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
an acute ST elevation MI in the anterior leads. Patient was
admitted to the cardiac care unit and the following issues were
addressed during her hospital course:

1. CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient with known 3V disease presented with
acute ST elevation MI. Extensive discussion took place between
patient's daughter (health care proxy) and cardiology team, and
it was decided that given comorbidities, risks/benefits or
coronary intervention, and most importantly, goals of
care/patient's wishes, medical management of MI was pursued.
Patient received Plavix load, Aspirin, and was started on
heparin and integrillin drips. Patient had been started on
Levophed drip in ED for blood pressure support which was weaned
off in the CCU. Heparin and Integrillin gtts were discontinued
after CPKs trended down. Patient received 10-20mg IV Lasix on
admission days 1 and 2 for diuresis, given marked crackles on
exam and elevated JVP. Patient was without chest pain during
hospital stay, though difficult to assess completely given
baseline dementia. The day after admission, patient's
hemodynamic status improved significantly (with significant
improvement in lung exam after diuresis), and blood pressure
medications were restored. Patient received an inpatient ECHO
for prognostic value, her EF was severely depressed (EF 25%)
[see full report in Results section].
.
2. MILD LEUKOCYTOSIS/HYPOTENSION ?SEPSIS
Patient presented with mild leukocytosis and hypotension in
setting of acute MI. Other sources of possible sepsis were
pursued and were unrevealing (UA, Blood Cxs, CXR). CXR with 6cm
opactiy in R apex, to be followed as outpatient (Patient's PCP's
office, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14959**] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, notified on
[**2194-11-15**]); clinically, patient without signs/symptoms of PNA -
they will follow. Leukocytosis resolved without antibiotic
therapy, and patient remained afebrile.
.
3. PSYCHIATRIC
Patient with baseline dementia, who was initially agitated after
admission to CCU. Per daughter, this was likely due to change in
setting. Patient required Haldol for sedation on admission day
1, and was not required on subsequent hospital days. Patient's
EKGs did not manifest QT prolongation. Outpatient Seroquel was
continued, and patient was started on low dose Zyprexa in the
evenings; [**Hospital 100**] Rehab to decide whether continuation of this
therapy will be necessary.
.
4. CVA history
Continue Depakote for seizure prophylaxis
.
5. DIABETES
Strict glycemic control was maintained with QID fingersticks and
insulin sliding scale.
