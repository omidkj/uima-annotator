.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2-28**]: Interval development of 2.5cm rounded,
hypodense fluid collection in the anterior aspect of the left
hepatic lobe, concerning for abscess especially in the context
of sepsis. The abscess is amenable to ultrasound-guided bedside
drainage.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**3-4**]: 1. Abnormal bowel in the mid to lower
abdomen with associated mesenteric edema is worrisome for
ischemic bowel and may be secondary to poor perfusion or
infectious etiologies. The proximal aspects of the SMA are
grossly patent.
2. Dilated fluid filled appendix likely reflecting appendicitis
in the proper clinical context unchanged compared to most recent
CT.
3. Stable intrahepatic abscess with focus of air.
4. Unchanged fluid within the gallbladder fossa tracking in a
subcapsular
location along the posterior inferior right hepatic lobe for
which biliary
leakage cannot be excluded given the recent cholecystectomy.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**3-15**]: 1. Moderate proximal small bowel
dilatation with a conglomerate of small bowel in the mid
abdomen, surrounded by mesenteric fat stranding. Findings
indicate a small-bowel obstruction possibly the result of an
nternal hernia.
2. Hypodense hepatic lesion has minimally decreased in size.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
KUB [**3-2**]: An NG tube terminates in the proximal stomach. An
internal biliary stent is again noted. Residual contrast is seen
in the large bowel. No significantly dilated small bowel loops
are identified. No pneumoperitoneum is detected. The study is
limited due to the overlying soft tissues.
.

ERCP [**2102-4-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Multiple metallic clips denote prior history of
cholecystectomy.
A nasogastric and nasointestinal tube are seen. There is a
plastic biliary
stent, which is subsequently removed. Cannulation of the biliary
duct is
successful and contrast medium injection results in complete
opacification of
the biliary tree. Mild dilatation of the CBD is seen. Multiple
filling
defects are present, attributed to sludge on the ERCP report. A
small amount
of contrast spillage is seen at the area of cholecystectomy
clips (image 16),
suggestive of a bile leak. A new biliary stent is placed. For
further
details, please refer to the full ERCP report in OMR.

[**2102-4-6**]
Small Bowel Follow Through:
1. No evidence of enteroenteric fistula.
2. Persistent loops of dilated small bowel with delayed contrast
passage into non-dilated distal small bowel and colon,
compatible with a partial small- bowel obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
#. Septic shock secondary to cholecystitis: Patient grew E. coli
and VRE in OSH blood cultures as well as E. coli, VRE, and
Kluyveria cryocresan (enterobacteriacae) in bile culture. Blood
cultures on admission here grew VRE; subsequent cultures were
negative until [**3-15**] when one bottle of two blood cultures grew
Gram positive cocci in pairs/clusters. In the setting of her
low-grade temperatures and line change after the blood cultures
were drawn, plan was to continue treating through her lines and
monitor closely. Her antibiotics were initially tailored to
linezolid, CTX, and Flagyl to complete 14-day course. Given
persistent temperatures, patient was broadened to Meropenem and
continued on Linezolid beyond 14 days, in discussions with ID.
ERCP on [**2102-2-16**] revealed normal biliary tree on limited
cholangiogram (biliary stent placed), normal limited
pancreatogram (pancreatic duct stent paced, and diffuse
ulcerations of the fundus, stomach body and antrum -
differential diagnosis includes stress ulcers and ischemia).
During repeat ERCP on [**2102-3-2**], pancreatic stent was removed and
biliary stent re-placed. Surgery was also consulted and
followed. She initially required aggressive IVF resuscitation
and Levophed, which was weaned off on [**2102-2-22**].  She needs repeat
ERCP 10 weeks initially stent placements on [**2-16**] for removal of
biliary stent. Also, CT abdomen and pelvis on [**2-28**] showed
a liver abscess that was aspirated with good effect - given
interval improvement in abscess size on antibiotics, IR did not
feel further drainage of the abscess was necessary. Liver
abscess cultures grew out VRE that was treated with extensive
course of Linezolid. Patient continued to [**Location 69856**] fevers
during her hospitalization. Urine cultures also subsequently
grew out [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans (presumptive identification) and
patient's beta-glucan climbed from 40 to 375 to 500. Patient was
started on Micafungin for possible fungal infection in setting
of high-dose, prolonged antibiotic courses, and then switched to
Fluconazole.
.
On [**2102-4-4**] she went to ERCP for concern for biliary stent
infection or obstruction.  The ERCP was concerning for bile
leak.  The old stent was removed and a new stent was placed.  On
repeat abdominal ultrasound, there was no drainable fluid
collection and she also had a small bowel follow through on
[**2102-4-6**] that did not show any entero-enteric fistula, but did
show a possible SBO v. ileus as the contrast media took a long
time to pass through. On [**2102-4-13**] patient's symptoms of
