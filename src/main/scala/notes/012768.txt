History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 y/o woman with hx gastric cancer s/p Roux-en-Y
gastrectomy in [**8-/2107**], with recurrent hospitalizations for
malnutrition, pain, and diarrhea/constipation presents from
[**Hospital1 **] LTAC with new-onset elevated LFTs, new abdominal pain,
and fever.  Since her Roux-en-Y, she has had persistent nausea
and vomiting and is unable to tolerate po intake, lost 15 lbs
over past several months (baseline weight 130-135 lbs, weight
before surgery 115 lb, weight now 99 lb).  On TPN and tube jeeds
through J-tube.  Increased diarrhea over past two weeks,
describes it before as being light colored and frothy, now brown
and watery. Has not initiated chemotherapy due to poor
nutritional status.
.
Over the past few days at [**Hospital1 **], her LFTs rose to AP 1500, ALT
500 and TBili 1.4. Morning of [**2107-11-4**] she had fever to 101. She
has chronic LLQ pain around J-tube, has new-onset RUQ pain and
increase abd pain diffusely.  Pain [**2106-3-9**], relieved with
Dilaudid, exacerbated by eating.  Noncon CT abdomen at [**Hospital1 **]
showed diffuse intrahepatic and extrahepatic ductal dilitation
and distention of the gallbladder. No obvious mass lesion was
identified, however contrast was not used due to hx allergy to
iodine. MRCP showed dilated CBD 16mm, fullness of pancreatic
head (no obvious mass), massively distended gallbladder and
right hydronephrosis.
.
Vitals prior to transfer: 111/63, 71, 97% on room air. Given
Zosyn 2.25mg as empiric coverage for cholangitis prior to
transfer.

cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, BRBPR, melena,
hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria, frequency.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
IR PTBD placement [**2107-11-7**] - FINDINGS:
1. High-grade obstruction at the distal CBD.
2. Left biliary tree was not opacified. Follow-up interrogation
should be performed if clinically indicated.
3.Placement of 10 French internal-external drain in the right
posterior ductal system.
5. Satisfactory post-procedure cholangiogram demonstrating
opacification of ducts and appropriate placement of catheter.
.
J-tube Fluoroscopic study [**2107-11-8**] - IMPRESSION: Functioning
J-tube.
.
CXR [**2107-11-9**]:
Heterogeneous pacity in right lower lobe may either represent
pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.
.
Abdomen S&E [**2107-11-9**]:
Decubitus and supine views of the abdomen show no evidence of
free air. There is a paucity of air within the abdomen and
retained enteric contrast is seen. The J-tube and biliary drains
are unchanged in position. A vague opacity seen in the right
lower lobe is concerning for either pneumonia or aspiration and
is better characterized on the concurrent chest x-ray. A
right-sided central line is noted. There are extensive
degenerative changes about the lower lumbar spine
.
Gastrograffin J tube check [**11-11**]:
IMPRESSION: No leak. J-tube is directed retrograde.
.
PTBD Check/Exchange [**2107-11-13**]:
1. Occluded existing 10 French percutaneous biliary drainage
catheter.
2. High-grade stricture of the distal common bile duct, 1-2 cm
distal to the
cystic duct insertion.
3. Uncomplicated replacement of a 10 French internal-external
biliary
drainage catheter
.
PICC Placement CXR [**2107-11-14**]:
1. Left PICC tip in mid-to-low SVC.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis with developing right apical opacity,
compatible with pneumonia
.
Biliary Stent Placement [**2107-11-16**]:
1. Reocclusion of a 10 French internal-external biliary drainage
catheter.
2. Successful deployment of 12 mm x 90 mm Wallstent across the
high-grade stricture of the distal common bile duct.
3. Pre-stenting and post-stenting balloon dilatation of the
high-grade stricture of the distal common bile duct using a 12 x
40 mm balloon.
4. Temporary placement of a 10 French Amplatz anchor drain into
the common hepatic duct anticipated to be removed within 24-48
hours. .
.
Biliary Stent Check [**2107-11-17**]
1. Occlusion of the metallic stent by the soft intraluminal
debris after recent metallic stent deployment and balloon
dilatation.
2. 10 French Amplatz anchor drain was left in place and
connected to the bag for external drainage.
3. Anticipated recanalization of the stent/sweeping and
dilatation will be performed with the assistance of department
of anesthesiology, either under monitored anesthesia care or
general anesthesia at the earliest available time.
.
Biliary Dilation [**2107-11-18**]
1. Pre-procedure occlusion of mid and distal portions of CBD
Wallstent.
2. Successful balloon dilatation and sweeping of CBD stent, with

post-procedure demonstration of stent patency. 8 French Amplatz
anchor drain left with tip in proximal CBD with orders to cap at
1800 on [**2107-11-18**].
3. J-tube injection showing probable antegrade orientation and
no leak around jejunostomy site.
.
Biliary Dilation: [**2107-11-21**]
1. Complete obstruction of the stent distal to this cystic duct
towards the duodenum.
2. Balloon dilatation with 12 mm x 40 mm balloon and balloon
sweep towards the duodenum.
3. Placement of a 12 French internal-external biliary drain,
which was capped f exchanged pr internal drainage. This drain
needs to be changed every 3 months.
