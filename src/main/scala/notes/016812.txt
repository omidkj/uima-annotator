History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6330**] is a 67 year-old African American male with a past
medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, h/o
heroin abuse, and end-stage renal disease s/p cadaveric
transplant in [**2134**], who presented to [**Hospital3 **]??????s Medical
Center on [**2139-12-3**] with complaint of dyspnea on exertion over
the two days PTA.  He denied associated chest pain,
palpitations, cough, nausea, vomiting, fevers, and chills. He
also denied change in urine output, hematuria, dysuria, and
recent NSAID use.  In the Emergency Department at the OSH, he
was noted to be hypertensive (169/78), and his physical exam was
consistent with CHF.  He was given 40 mg IV Lasix with good
response (1 L urine output).  Lab data on admission was notable
for a BUN/ Cr of 36/3.3 and HCT = 28.4. Urinalysis showed 1+
protein, and sediment was remarkable for an occasional RBC and
WBC, with no evidence of dysmorphic RBCs, muddy brown casts, or
red cell casts.
*
At the OSH, the patient was evaluated by the Nephrology staff.
The patient was administered all of his medications except his
enalapril.  He was monitored for signs of heroin withdrawal. His
cardiac enzymes were notable for a CK of 93, MB of 3.3, and
troponin value of 0.2. The patient underwent an ECHO which
disclosed an EF of 70% and mild LVH.
*
On the day of admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was noted to have
persistently elevated blood pressures (220/106) at the OSH.  Per
report, the patient remained asymptomatic.  He was given his
usual blood pressure medications, as well as does of Labetalol
(20 mg IV, 600 mg PO), Hydralazine (20 mg IV, 50 mg PO),
Clonidine (0.2 mg/24 hr patch, 0.1 mg PO), and Nitropaste (3
inches). Despite administration of these medications, the
patient??????s SBP remained >200. Given patient??????s persistent
hypertension and acute renal failure, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up and management,
including renal biopsy in the setting a post-transplant patient.

*
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for acute care and
evaluation of his renal failure.  A renal ultrasound was
obtained which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis, as well as
patent vasculature.  The Renal service was also consulted.  On
transfer to the floor, the patient reported doing well.  He
denied CP/SOB, N/V, diarrhea, abdominal pain, HA, or dizziness.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo man w/ h/o HTN, DM2, ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant
[**2134**], who presented to OSH w/ DOE x 2 days.  At the OSH, he was
found to have CHF, ARF, and refractory HTN.  He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval and managment.
*
1) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:
ARF in this patient raised concern for late allograft
dysfunction. Diff diagnosis of late acute dysfunction included
prerenal azotemia due to volume depletion, cyclosporine
nephrotoxicity, acute rejection (possibly due to non-compliance
with immunosuppressive medications), urinary tract obstruction,
and renal transplant artery stenosis (which is associated with
hypertension). Other etiologies possible included acute tubular
necrosis due to sepsis or nephrotoxins or drug- or
infection-induced interstitial nephritis. Given this patient??????s
poorly controlled blood pressure, there is also the possibility
that he has hypertensive nephrosclerosis from poorly controlled
hypertension.   Normal renal ultrasound makes obstruction and
renal transplant stenosis less likely.  The renal service was
consulted, and performed a renal biopsy shortly after admission.
 His cyclosporin was continued, but his serum levels were
followed on a daily basis.  He was also continued on CellCept.
Renal recommended starting Solu-Medrol 500 mg IV daily.  Over
the course of his hospitalization, his renal function worsened.
A renal U/S was repeated, but unchanged.  He was discharged in
stable condition with close follow-up scheduled to see his PCP,
