Date of Birth:  [**2105-10-27**]             Sex:   F

Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Ventilation from [**Date range (3) 56262**]
Cardiac Catheterization on [**2144-6-30**]

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 38 y/o female with a h/o longstanding HTN who was
G4P2012 and 2 weeks post c/s (27 weeks for oligohydramnios and
fetal distress, twins delivered, but died after birth) who was
in her usual state of health the day prior to admission ([**6-23**]),
went to sleep, and awoke around 3 am short of breath. She
attempted to go to the bathroom, was incontinent of stool, and
then began experiencing increasing SOB. Her husband reports her
coughing up frothy fluid. EMS was called, and while waiting for
their arrival, the pt went into respiratory arrest. On EMS
arrival, spontaneous, labored breathing resumed with rr 26, sat
76%, bp 200/p, hr 136. A failed intubation occured in the field,
the pt was taken to an outside hospital and intubated there, and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the EW, she was found to be febrile
with a WBC of 34 and received levfloxacin 500mg x 1, flagyl
500mg x 1, and vanco 1g x 1.  She had an echo showing severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis, a dilated right ventricular
cavity with severe global free wall hypokinesis, Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation, mild (1+) mitral regurgitation and mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. She experienced brief
hypotension after propofol, NTG gtt, and lasix and was
temporarily placed on levophed. The pateint was then transferred
to the CCU for treatment and monitoring.  At the time, per the
patient's husband, the patient had been doing well, without
f/c/n/v, doe, cough, chest pain, sob, orthopnea/pnd with some LE
edema, but stable.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension - Longstanding hypertension since before [**2135**],
medical records from PCP indicate BPs in the 140-170s/90-100s
despite 3 antihypertensive management.
Anxiety.
OBGYN Hx - G4P2102 s/p emergent c/s at 27 wks for twins on
6/[**2143**].  Pt was unaware of pregnancy until 3 weeks before
delivery and was consuming alchol and tobacco up through
c-section.  Twins expired shortly after birth.

Social History:
Married, lives with husband.  2 children.  Works as a cashier.
Tobacco - 1-1.5 ppd since age 15
EtOH - 5 beers/day on and off since teenager.
Denies any illicit drug use.

Family History:
Identical twin sister with hypertension and episode of
cardiomyopathy seen on echo that has since resolved with normal
repeat echos.
Maternal grandfather (deceased age 71)- congestive heart
failure.
Maternal grandmother (living)- CHF, DM, colon & cervical CA,
stroke, and HTN.

age 42.
Uncle (living) - Cardiomyopathy.
2 sisters (living) - hypertension, elevated cholesterol.

Brief Hospital Course:
CARDIAC:
PUMP: Cardiomyopathy of unclear origin.  Severe systolic
dysfuction with EF of 20% and global hypokinesis.  Likely
multifactorial etiology, broad differential most likely either
[**1-20**] long-standing hypertension, alcohol abuse, or postpartum
myopathy. Ischemic origin excluded w/ cath (see below), familial
and viral etiology could not be excluded.  Extensive
rheumatologic, infectious, endocrinologic work-up unrevealing
(see labs above).  ETT MIBI performed on [**6-29**] under Modified
[**Doctor First Name **] Protocol had exercise duration of 6 min with termination
for fatigue and 89% of maximum heart rate obtained; ECG showed
diffuse upsloping ST segment depressions and sinus rhythm
without ectopy.  Stress images showed a partially reversible,
moderate-severe myocardial perfusion defect involving the distal
anterior wall and apex, consistent with LAD distribution.
Anterior wall is severely hypokinetic with EF of 44%. Cardiac
catheterization performed on [**6-30**] revealed a right dominant
system with normal coronary arteries and no flow limiting
disease.  Ventriculogram showed anterobasal, anterolateral,
apical, inferior, and posterobasal walls that were hypokinetic
with a calculated contrast ejection fraction was 36%. Resting
hemodynamics were normal with a mean PA of 21 mmHg, mean PA of 4
mmHg, RVEDP 7 mmHg,
PCW mean 9 mmHg, LVEDP 14 mmHg, CO 4.1 L/min, CI 2.6 l/min/m2.
Patient will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] to evaluate for myocardial
recovery.  Patient euvolemic on discharge with a dry weight of
80.6 kg to be maintained with Lasix 20mg PO QD and afterload
reduction with Lisinopril 40mg PO QD and Metoprolol XL 300 PO
QD.  Continue coumadin for global hypokinesis.

CORONARIES: No previous history of CAD.  Cardiac catheterization
on [**7-1**] showed normal coronary arteries.  Primary risk reduction
couseling provided.  Continue aspirin, consider statin (has
significant family hx of early CAD).

RHYTHM: Tachycardicia in hospital.  Likely multifactorial
(fever, EtOH withdrawl, HTN, nicotine withdrawl).  Continue
Metoprolol XL 300 QD.  Repeat echo in one month.  Consider
electrophysiologic evaluation for risk stratification for an
arrhthmic event (if depressed EF persists after time alotted for
recovery from hibernating myocardium).

HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY: Found in the field with SBP > 200.
Elevated BPs from 130-160s/70-100s initially controlled with
nipride drip.  Nipride weaned off and BP controlled with PO meds
consisting of: Metoprolol 300 mg PO QD, Amlodipine 10mg PO QD,
Lisinopril 40mg PO QD, Clonidine patch.  Secondary hypertensive
work-up negative for pheo (final labs pending at time of
discharge, will be followed by med student and faxed to PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**]), aortic coarctation, hyperparathyroidism,
hypothyroidism, cushings.  Normal renal ultrasound.  Patient
discharged with normal blood pressures of 110-130s/60-80s.

RESPIRTORY FAILURE: Collapsed at home with respiratory failure
and intubated at outside hospital for severe respiratory
distress.  CXR representative of CHF as well as focal
opacification in the left lung base which could be a
superimposed infection.  Sputum cultures negative.  Patient
received 10 day course of antibiotics for empiric treatment.
Patient diuresed with lasix.  Pt successfully extubated on day 3
of CCU stay.  Respiratory failure most likely [**1-20**] pulmonary
edema [**1-20**] cardiomyopathy or aspiration pneumonia.  On discharge,
patient had O2 sats > 97%
