Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
right sided weakness and aphasia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement
neurointervention (cerebral angio and clot retrieval)
intubation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 55729**] is a 77 yo RH woman with PMH of PAF, HTN, DLP,
tobacco use and is now 9 days post 2-vessel CABG with tissue St.
[**Male First Name (un) 923**] MVR (at [**Hospital3 **]) who developed acute onset of right
sided weakness and difficulty speaking. She was maintained on
ASA only. She had been
previously well and was seen to be walking and talking by her
nurse at 19:25.  However, she subsequently developed right sided
weakness and aphasia.  Concerned about a stroke, a STAT NCHCT at
[**Hospital3 **] showed no hypodensity but was significant for a
distal left M1/M2 clot.Given her recent CABG, she was not a tPA
candidate.  She was then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for urgent evaluation and possible
neuroIR intervention.
     Upon arrival, she was noted to have a L MCA syndrome with a
NIHSS of 21.  A repeat CT/CTA/CTP showed some evolution of her
left MCA stroke and no major change in her MCA-occlusion in the
setting of a large mismatch.  Given that, she was sent for a
MERCI clot retrieval.

ROS: Unable as patient globally aphasic.

ECG [**2118-6-25**]:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Probable inferior myocardial
infarction, age indeterminate. Non-specific ST-T wave changes

CT head [**2118-6-25**]:
1.  CT head shows dense left middle cerebral artery in the
bifurcation region with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation in the left insular cortex.  Small vessel
disease and brain atrophy.  No hemorrhage.
2.  CT perfusion demonstrates large area of ischemia with
probable small
infarct in the left MCA territory.
3.  CT angiography of the neck demonstrates mild atherosclerotic
disease at the left carotid bifurcation.
4.  CT angiography of the head demonstrates likely thrombus at
the left middle cerebral artery bifurcation with markedly
diminished flow in the superior division and some decrease in
flow in the inferior division of the left middle cerebral
artery.
