Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath, NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Intubation
Transfusion of packed RBC
Bronchoscopy with BAL
Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66 yo woman with PMH DM (poor compliance) who was
initially admitted to [**Location (un) **] [**2105-3-21**] with c/o "high blood
sugars".  Also noted to have CP and SOB.  Patient is poor
historian, but states chest pain located in center of chest,
unable to characterize or identify strength of pain, came on at
rest while she was at home, associated with SOB.  She denies
having this chest pain before, denies recent angina or DOE
symptoms, LE edema, PND, orthopnea.  However, per daughter, she
states that the patient has been c/o SOB x past month, described
as DOE.  Daughter denies that patient has been having chest
pain.
.
Patient was admitted to ICU at [**Location (un) **] for management of her
hyperglycemia(Glucose = 1200).  On admission, she also ruled for
NSTEMI with Trop=7.46, and was also noted to have ARF with
elevated Cr=4, which was thought [**2-19**] hypovolemia from diuresis
from elevated blood sugars.  She was started on an insulin drip
with good control of blood sugars, started on plavix, aspirin,
heparin, statin and beta blocker for her NSTEMI.  She was not
started on an ACE I due to her ARF.  She was given stress dose
steroids, as she was on prednisone as an outpatient and ?found
to be adrenally insuffiecient.   During her [**Hospital3 **]
course, her peak Trop=28.72, CK 647, MB 82.1.  Patient was noted
to have elevated LFTs during hospital course, and therefore
lipitor was d/ced (although thought elevated LFTs could also
have been [**2-19**] shock liver as patient was hypotensive on initial
admission).  Patient underwent ECHO on [**2105-3-23**] that demonstrated
inferior ischemia, EF=40%.  She had episode of SOB on floor for
which she received 40mg IV lasix with good UOP and resolution of
symtpoms.  On [**2105-3-24**] patient underwent dobutamine stress test
that was stopped due to SOB and CP, decreased O2 sat to 85%, TWI
in lead II and III.  She was started on nitro gtt and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.  On transfer,
patient's labs notable for Cr decreased to 1.3, glucose 245, WBC
12.6, Hct 34.3.
.
On arrival to cath lab, patient noted to have diffuse b/l
crackles, increased O2 requirement, inablitity to lay flat.  She
was therefore transferred to CCU for diuresis prior to cath.
.
Currently patient denies CP/pressure, SOB, feels "tired", no
other complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  Patient is a 66 yo woman with longstanding DM,
lung ca s/p resection presents with NSTEMI, [**Hospital 27810**] transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
.
# Respiratory:  Patient presented w/ evidence of CHF, with
crackles on exam, CXR c/w CHF.  Also w/ hx of COPD, steroid
dependent.  However, on admission, patient was diuresed > 5L but
continued to be hypoxic and eventually required intubation.
Therefore other etiologies were considered for hypoxia.  Chest
CT [**3-27**] demonstrates interstitial septal thickening and ground
glass opacities in R lung c/w pulm edema vs pulm hemorrhage vs
acute interstitial pna vs lymphegenic carcinomatosis, L hilar
finding ?recurrent ca vs scar.  Patient was treated empirically
for pna (sputum cx from [**3-27**] w/ MSSA and H.Flu) with broad
spectrum abx (vanc, aztreonam) and was extubated on [**2105-3-31**].
Post extubation, she remained tenuous in her respiratory status.
 On night of [**2105-4-5**] pt underwent respiratory arrest, causing
code (7 minutes), and was intubated.  Again, unclear etiology of
her underlying pulmonary process, as no clinical evidence of
volume overload or apparent cause of flash pulmonary edema, on
broad spectrum abx w/ vanc, aztreonam and clindamycin, and on
[**Date Range 3782**] steroid dose of pred 10mg qd for COPD.  Patient was
started empirically on bactrim 200mg IV q6hr for PCP coverage,
as LDH has remained high throughout hospitalization.  Resp
status continues to be tenuous.  Urine legionella negative.
Bronch [**4-7**] BAL for cytology + for highly atypical cells,
suspicious for sq cell carcinoma, remainder of micro negative
(PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/Cx, AFB, fungal, legionella, nocardia).  Pulm service
questioned lymphagetic spread of carcinoma.  Patient was
evaluted for IP thoracentesis of R sided effusion to confirm
malignant effusion.  There was also a possibilty of VATS vs
trans-bronchial bx in future. Patient also underwent 14 day
course abx with vanc, aztreonam, also transiently on bactrim
empirically for PCP (micro negative from BAL).  Patient was also
continued on her home dose of prednisone 10 mg QD as well as
inhalers.  She continued to require high PEEPs and close to 100%
FiO2.  Patient subsequently underwent another hypoxia induced
PEA arrest (12 minutes) on [**4-13**] requirement brief dopamine
infusion.  The etiology of her PEA arrests remained uncertain
with hypoxia being most likely diagnosis.  Patient's mental
status also continued to worsen.  Patient was subsequently
started on morphine drip for comfort as she became bradycardic
and hypotensive on AM of [**2105-4-18**].  Patient subsequently expired
after she became asystolic due to presumed cardiac failure and
superimposed renal failure on 9:56 am on [**2105-4-18**]
.
# Lung ca s/p resection:  Is possible ?recurrent lung ca
contributing to SOB sxs.  CXR on admission demonstrates L hilar
mass c/w recurrent lung ca vs adenopathy vs scar from radiation.
 Chest CT as above - repeat Chest CT demonstrates diffuse
consolidation, per pulm w/ BAL results, likely represents
lymphagenic spread of ca, likely contributing/causing pt's
respiratory issues.
.
# Renal:  Patient had ARF at outside hosptial, thought pre-renal
given elevated glucose at 1200 and osmotic diuresis.  On
presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], Cr had normalized to 1.0.  Throughout
hospital course thus far, pt developed contrast induced
nephropathy following first cath, with Cr peak = 3.5.  Cr then
resolved to 1.2, but then had code on [**4-5**] with repeat cardiac
cath (although small amount of dye was used), and Cr now
trending back up.  Patient also w/ continued hematuria w/ blood
tinged urine - was on CBI, now d/ced per urology recs.  Her UO
continued to decrease and her Cr continued to rise.
.
# Cardiac:
A. Ischemic:  Patient initially presented to OSH with CP, r/i
for NSTEMI, started on heparin gtt, underwent dobutamine stress
test and developed CP, SOB, TWI in inferior leads (II, III,
avF), transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
