Attending:[**Known firstname 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Afib with RVR complicated by flash pulmonary edema and hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
65F with PMHx significant for recently diagnosed atrial
fibrillation (discharged [**2121-8-26**], not anticoagulated), CVA with
residual R facial droop/dysphagia s/p G-tube, and CAD s/p PCI of
RCA in [**2114**], who presents to the ED from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
palpitations, suprapubic pressure, and feeling generally unwell.
Per report she was hypotensive at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, however, she was
not hypotensive at any point in our ED.

Non-contrast head CT showed no acute intracranial process. Labs
were significant for lactate 2.1, AST 161, ALT 241, normal WBC
with slight left shift, troponin <0.01, Hgb/Hct 11.6/35.3
(stable), and urinalysis suggestive of infection (0 epis, mod
leuk, mod bacteria, WBC 13). CXR showed worsening CHF with
moderate to severe pulmonary edema, increased size of bilateral
pleural effusions (R>L), and bibasilar airspace opacities.
Patient received clindamycin 600mg IV and levofloxacin 500mg IV
to cover for possible pneumonia (has penicillin allergy). She
was ordered for vancomycin but did not receive it. An EKG
checked prior to transfer to the ICU showed afib with RVR @ 115.
VS on transfer were 99% 4L NC, 138/100, HR 120.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is sleepy, but states that her
symptoms have improved.

IMAGING
CT HEAD [**2121-9-5**]
HISTORY:  55-year-old female with history of CVA, now with
altered mental
status.
STUDY:  CT of the head without contrast; images were acquired in
soft tissue
and bone algorithms.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images
were also
generated.
COMPARISON:  [**2119-4-20**].
FINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass
effect.
Bilateral basal ganglia infarcts are unchanged from prior exam.
Metallic
streak artifact from basilar tip aneurysm clip is present.
Post-right
temporal craniotomy changes are present along with
encephalomalacia of the
right temporal lobe.  The ventricles and sulci are prominent
compatible with
age-related involutional changes.  The visualized paranasal
sinuses
demonstrate moderate mucosal thickening in the left sphenoid
sinus. Mastoid
air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial process.
2.  Old infarct and encephalomalacia as described above.
3.  Left sphenoid sinus disease.

CXR PA/Lateral [**9-5**]
HISTORY:  Chest pain.
TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
COMPARISON:  [**2121-8-22**] chest radiograph and chest CTA.
FINDINGS:
Lung volumes are low.  Evaluation of the right lung apex is
obscured due to
the patient's chin projecting over this region.  The heart size
remains
moderate to severely enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and
aneurysmally
dilated, better seen on the prior CT.  In the interval, there is
worsening
pulmonary edema which is now moderate to severe in extent, with
increased size
of bilateral pleural effusions which are small to moderate on
the right and
trace on the left.  Ill-defined airspace opacities within the
lung bases could
reflect atelectasis though
