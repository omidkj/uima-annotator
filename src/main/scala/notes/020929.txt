Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**]
Chief Complaint:
one week of nausea, vomiting, anorexia, one day of acute dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
paracentesis [**2120-11-30**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 59 y/o man with h/o pancreatic CA diagnosed in [**8-16**] at
[**Hospital6 1708**], with metastases to liver, s/p
attempted percutaneous transhepatic drainage, s/p open T tube
placement with interval attempted Whipple procedure [**2120-10-31**] in
[**Country 532**], s/p cisplatin 10 days prior to admission, who presented
to ED on [**2120-11-30**] with 1 week h/o N/V, anorexia, and acute
dyspnea.  Pt had returned from [**Country 532**] 3 d PTA.  On the morning
of admission, the pt awoke with dyspnea, weakness and
disorientation, was found wandering around his bathroom opening
windows to "get some air."  No fever or chills.  No
nausea/vomiting today.  No chest pain/palpitations.  No
abdominal pain, melena, dysuria, hematochezia.  On arrival to
ED, the patient's blood pressure was 130s/70s and he was
tachycardic to 130.  BP trended down over 4 hours, at nadir, VS:
BP: 89/61 HR 99 RR: 18 satting 95% 2L NC. (91% RA).  Had CTA
showing a subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the right lower
lobe.  Labs demonstrated a WBC ct of 22, 93% neutrophils, no
bands.  Lactate 2.2.  Abd CT showed large amount of ascitic
fluid.  Paracentesis done revealed 10,325 WBC (94 poly, 1L, 5M),
450 RBC, 3 protein, 182 glucose, 228 LDH, with peritoneal fluid
Gram stain 4+PMH, no microorganisms, fluid cx positive for few
Enterococcus from broth ([**Last Name (un) 36**] to amp, levo, PCN w/ vanco
pending), anaerobic bottle: GNR, beta lactamase pos. Blood cx
with NGTD.  In the ED, he got 6L NS, vancomycin IV 1gm,
levofloxacin 500mg, flagyl 500mg, and heparin infusion before
MICU called.  In MICU, he was continued on Zosyn, Levoflox, and
Vanco was added, then d/c'd [**12-2**].  He was aggressively fluid
resuscitated. During his stay in the MICU, he continued to
improve, tolerating po, afebrile, WBC ct trending down.  IV
heparin drip was continued for his PE, transitioned to lovenox
on transfer to floor.
.
Also of note, CXR and CTA chest showing small left pleural
effusion, with RUL consolidation w/ cavitation.

Pertinent Results:
Admission EKG: sinus tach @ 130 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no
ST changes, no prior tracing for comparison
.
CXR([**11-30**]): left sided pleural effusion, rounded opacity in RUL
zone w/ suggestion of cavitation. No pulm edema.
.
CT([**11-30**]): Probable isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolus in
the right lower lobe. Moderate amount of free air and large
amount of ascites in the abdomen. Large pancreatic mass
measuring 4.6 x 4.5 cm, which compresses and nearly occludes the
portal vein and the distal splenic vein. The SMV is patent.
Large left adrenal mass is suspicious for metastatic disease,
but the appeareance is nonspecific. Right upper lobe of the lung
consolidation with cavitation. Small left pleural effusion.
Per Surgical Note/Read: Also with intraabd subphrenic abscess
after recent laparotomy.  Did not rec. drainage.
.
CXR ([**12-3**]): New small right pleural effusion and unchanged
right upper lobe opacity, left basilar opacity and left pleural
effusion
.
CXR [**2120-12-9**]:  RUL cavitary lesion between 2.5 and 3.0 cm,
unchanged in size, however, new four peribronchial
consolidations suspicious for progressive infection.
.
KUB: [**2120-12-9**]: partial SBO vs. ileus, NGT in stomach
.
[**2120-12-9**]:  Liver doppler US: Several areas of focal
heterogeneity, with echotexture c/w metastatic lesions.  Several
hypoechoic focal linear lesions seen throughout liver that
likely represent pneumobilia.  Lesion seen in falciform
ligament, likely peritoneal mets.  Significant ascites.
Irregular slow flow through portal vein.
.
[**2120-12-10**]:  Portable CXR showing no significant change.  Moderate
bilateral pleural effusions present.  NGT in place.  Subclavian
line in place, no PTX.
.
[**2120-12-10**]:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. A 5.0 x 4.7 cm mass in the pancreatic head, corresponding to
the patient's known pancreatic cancer. There is extension of
this into the adjacent duodenum, and extensive hepatic,
mesenteric, and left adrenal metastases. The main venous and
arterial vasculature appears to be widely patent. The patient is
status post Whipple for this, and changes relating to surgery
can be identified.
2. Extensive ascites. Additionally, there are two small foci of
air adjacent to the liver, which may be from recent intervention
such as paracentesis. No other foci of air or oral contrast
extravasation can be identified. There is no evidence of small
or large bowel obstruction.
3. Focal hypodensities within the kidneys which are too small to
characterize.
4. Bilateral moderate sized pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
5. There are wedge-shaped areas of different attenuation within
the liver which may represent focal fatty infiltration or
perfusion abnormalities.
.
[**2120-12-12**]: CXR AP chest compared to [**12-7**] and 29.
Although previous mild edema in the right upper lung has
cleared, atelectasis has worsened and now the right middle,
right lower and left lower lobes are collapsed. There is also at
least a moderate amount of pleural effusion on both sides of the
chest and unchanged. Cardiac silhouette is obscured. There is
probably mediastinal venous engorgement. Tip of the left PIC
catheter projects over the left brachiocephalic vein. No
pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. Right upper
lobe nodules are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 59-yo Russian speaking man w/ pancreatic CA s/p
failed whipple and cisplatin therapy, HTN, DM2 admitted
initially to MICU fpr pulmonary embolism and spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis, s/p IV heparin drip transitioned to
lovenox subcutaneously, with SBP being treated with Zosyn.  The
