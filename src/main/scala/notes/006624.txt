Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea with exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2134-5-31**] Aortic valve replacement(21 Porcine)Coronary artery
bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery and reverse saphenous vein graft to
the obtuse marginal artery, reverse saphenous vein graft to the
posterior diagonal artery.


History of Present Illness:
79 year old female with history of aortic stenosis which has
been followed by serial echocardiograms. She has noted worsening
exercise tolerance and dyspnea with exertion over the past year.
Her echocardiograms have demonstrated worsening aortic stenosis
with increasing peak and mean gradients. Her last echocardiogram
showed an aortic valve area of 0.5cm2 with a peak gradient of
94mmHg. Of note, there is evidence of severe pulmonary
hypertension with her systolic pulmonary artery pressure
measuring 91mmHg. Given the progression and severity fo her
disease, she was referred for surgical management.

Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened and
display fibrinous degradation. There is moderate thickening of
the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results in the operating room at
the time of the study.
POST BYPASS The patient is AV paced. The patient is receiving
milrinone and epinephrine by infusion. There is normal
biventricular systolic function though poor image quality
prevents complete exclusion of a focal wall motion abnormality.
There is a bioprosthesis located in the aortic position. It
appears well seated. The leaflets can not be seen. There is
trace valvular aortic regurgitation. The peak gradients through
the aortic valve range from 25 to 40 mmHg with cardiac output in
the 5 liters/minute range with means in the 10 to 17 mmHg range.
The effective area is in the 1.2 cm2 range, on average. The rest
of valvular function is essentially unchanged. The thoracic
aorta is intact after decannulation..
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 111825**] was a same day admit to the operating room on [**5-31**]
where she underwent an aortic valve replacement and coronary
artery bypass graft. Please see operative report for surgical
details. In summary she had: aortic valve replacement with 21 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine valve and coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,
reverse saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal artery and
reverse saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery. Her
bypass time was 129 minutes with a crossclamp time of 97
minutes. She tolerated the operation well and following surgery
she was transferred to the CVICU for recovery and invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned
from sedation awoke neurologically intact and extubated.  Beta
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward
the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery on POD2.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol. The
remainder of her hospital course was uneventful. She was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on
post-operative day six the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with ultram.  The
patient was discharged with home physical therapy with
appropriate follow up instructions.
