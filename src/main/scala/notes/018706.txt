Pacer firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
74 M with h/o dialated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD placement
presents following firing of pacer.  Patient has been having
shortness of breath over the past couple weeks.  He was recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**10-30**] after being admitted for CHF
exacerbation.  At that time, it was noted by EP that he would go
into NSVT in the setting of volume overload.  Patient eloped
before being staffed by EP.  This afternoon, after taking his
nebs, his IACD fired for a reason that was unclear to him.  He
called an ambulence and was taken to the ED.  He had a second
pacer shock en route.

In the ED, he was started on amiodorome bolus.  At that time, he
had a 40 run beat VT and dropped SBP to 85.  He was givin a
fluid bolus, and a CCU bed was requested.

On arrival in the CCU, he had some residule pain from being
shocked but no other chest pain.  He denied significant
shortness of breath.  He notes sleeping on two pillows at night.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 M with dialated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD placement admitted
for hypotension in setting of amiodorone loading for VT.

VENTRICULAR ARRYTHMIA:  Thought to be ventricular tachycardia.
A-fib with aberrancy unlikely given history AV nodal ablation.
Etiology was likely volume overload and infection, as ischemia
ruled out and PE unlikely with therapeutic INR. Pt was
aggressively diuresed as tolerated by his renal function. He was
also started on a beta blocker and amiodarone to suppress
ectopic ventricular source. After several days of amiodarone
loading, pt was noted to have elevated LFTs, requiring stopping
of Amiodarone. His beta-blocker was increased while the
amiodarone washed out. Pt was anticoagulated with warfarin with
an INR goal [**1-29**], with doses altered based on interacting drugs
(amiodarone, levaquin).

INFECTION:  Patient with leukocytosis (although on chronic
prednisone), temperature to 103.2, dropping systolic BPs,
tachypnea, and productive cough.  Source was thought to be
pulmonary although no cultures grew is most likely source.  Pt
improved dramatically when started on Levaquin, and Vancomycin
was added given positive MRSA screen. Pt is to finish a 7 day
course of abx.

Systolic CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Pt diuresed aggressively as
tolerated by his blood pressures and renal function.

HYPERTENSION: Controlled with Cozaar and higher dose Metoprolol

COPD: Pt did not appear to be in acute flair and was continued
on his home regimen of Albuterol/ipratroprium nebs, advair, and
prednisone.

ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine was somewhat above
baseline on admission and rose with agressive diuresis.  It was
trending down at discharge.  Discharge Cr was 1.9
