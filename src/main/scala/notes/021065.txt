History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 47212**] is a very pleasant 85 year old man with a PMH
significant for dementia, right hip fx, IDDM, who presents to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with 'feeling crummy.' Per report, he experienced some
high BS this AM, and so took 8 units of Lantus and 6 U Humalog.
He went to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where he was noted to be tachycardic to
150, hypotense to the 80s systolic, and with some altered
sensorium. Per report, his CXR there was clear. He received a
dose of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin, and a L IJ was placed. They
also talked to the family, and apparently reversed his code
status from DNR/DNI to intubate him to see if he would be able
to make it through this episode.
.
He was Med-flighted to the [**Hospital1 18**] and in the ED was started on
Levophed, which made him tachycardic into the 150s with an
apparent SVT; the ED thus tried to wean him from Levophed to
Phenylephrine.
.
In total, he receieved 5.5 L of IVF prior to arriving to the
ICU. He received a dose of IV Zosyn for further GNR coverage,
and a repeat CXR looked possibly c/w aspiration. He had a rectal
temperature of 101. He was placed on the vent, with TV 150, Rate
16, Peep 8. Labs in the ED were notable for a lactate of 6.2,
ABG of 7.28/32/121, HCT 26.8, bicarbonate of 15, and AG acidosis
at 15, with an INR of 1.6. He also had a grossly dirty U/A. Of
note, he has an indwelling Foley [**2-22**] to BPH, and has had
multiple UTIs in the past, per his son's report.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and sedated.

STUDIES:
TTE: EF 30-35%. Prior inferior infarction with aneurysm
formation and global hypokinesis. Dilated and depressed right
ventricle. Mild mitral regurgitation (cannot exclude
endocarditis on the basis of this study). There is a small
pericardial effusion anterior to the right ventricle. There is
echodense material along the right ventricular free wall which
may be an anterior fat pad or due to echodense material in the
effusion.

[**3-15**] CXR:
1. ET tube in appropriate location.
2. Left internal jugular central venous catheter has tip in the
mid
brachiocephalic veins.
3. Mild interstitial edema with atelectasis and or concurrent
pneumonia.

[**3-15**] LENIS: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either
lower extremity.

[**3-16**] KUB: Overall paucity of bowel gas. Small-bowel obstruction
or ileus
cannot be excluded. Recommend clinical correlations.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old man with a PMH significant for dementia, right hip
fx, IDDM, who presents in septic shock.
.
# Septic Shock: Source was attributed to urosepsis and pneumonia
given E. coli in urine, blood, and sputum. Patient was
maintained on two pressors initially and fluid resuscitated w/ 4
L on admission to MICU. He was transfused two units of blood for
low hct and SvO2 in the 60s. He was started on a bicarb gtt for
persistent acidosis. He was treated broadly w/ vanc and zosyn
which was narrowed to CTX when culture sensitivities returned.
He was found to have C. diff during his admission and started on
flagyl and PO vanco. A family meeting was held to discuss his
prognosis and he was made DNR and subsequently CMO when he
failed to show significant signs of being able to come off the
ventilator after a trial of maximal medical therapy. These
decisions were based in part on the patient's original wishes to
be DNR/DNI prior to this event and was not clear he would have
wanted to have been intubated in the first place.  He was
extubated on [**3-18**] at 7pm and expired on the morning of [**3-19**] at
9:10AM.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient had AF w/ RVR at times, worsened
on levophed. Pressors were switched to neo and vasopressin to
reduce beta agonism and he was loaded with IV amiodarone and
digoxin. Echo showed old inferior infarct and EF 30-35%.
.
# Respitory Failure: Was intubated at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] and
continued on ventilator support until [**3-18**] when was extubated.
.
# Anemia: HCT drop from 34-->23, likely dilutional. Was
transfused 2 units.
