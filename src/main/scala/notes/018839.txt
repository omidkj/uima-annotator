Relevant imaging studies:
[**2106-9-4**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in
the extent of small left parietal subdural hematoma with a
dominant portion of the hematoma measuring unchanged,
approximately 4 mm.

[**2106-9-6**]: CAROTID SERIES, COMPLETE: IMPRESSION: No evidence of
internal carotid artery stenosis on either side.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo f w/ PMHx afib on Coumadin, HTN, CHF, who presented to ED
following fall in with questionable LOC and confirmed subdural
hematoma.

1) Fall: Syncope vs. mechanical fall. She recalled the events
leading to the fall, but could not recall the actual fall except
for the part where she hit her head, suggesting a probable
syncopal event. This was unwitnessed, however, and corroboration
could not be obtained. She was initially evaluated at an outside
hospital, where a CT scan of the head showed a small left
parietal subdural
hematoma. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. At
[**Hospital1 18**], a repeat CT scan of the head without contrast confirmed a
4 mm left parietal subdural hematoma, without midline shift. Her
warfarin-induced coagulopathy was reversed with vitamin K and
FFP in the ED, and she was admitted to the trauma-ICU for close
observation. A follow-up CT scan the following morning
demonstrated interval decrease in the extent of the small left
parietal SDH. She was transferred to the floor for furhter
work-up of her apparent syncopal event.

Per neurosurgery, she is to hold her anticoagulation for 1
month.

2) Syncope: Serial cardiac biomarkers showed a slightly elevated
CK-MBI,
with normal CK and flat troponins X 3. She was observed on
telemetry, without arrhythmic events. The EP service
additionally interrogated her pacer, without evidence of a
recent event. Carotid series were finally obtained, and
demonstrated no evidence of ICA disease. A basic infectious
work-up was negative. The possibility of vasovagal syncope or
orthostasis remains, but could not be confirmed. Orthostatic
vitals obtained at the time of transfer to the floor were
within normal limits. A repeat TTE was not obtained given our
low overall suspicion of a cardiac ischemic event or severe
stenotic valvular disease, but could certainly be considered in
the out-patient setting.

She was evaluated by physical therapy on the day of discharge,
and deemed safe for discharge home with services, including
physical therapy.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after falling and hitting your head.
It is unclear whether or not you lost consciousness. You were
taken to a different hospital and found to have a subdural
hematoma (a small bleed in your head), at which time you were
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  A repeat scan of your head showed the
small bleed to be stable and not increasing in size or volume.
An xray of your shoulder was taken and showed no fractures or
dislocations.  You were started on Dilantin while in the
hospital. Please take dilantin for 7 more days after going home.
Also, while in the hospital, your digoxin level was low and your
dosage was increased to 0.125mg daily.

Please take all of your medications as directed. Please go to
all of your follow-up appointments. If you experience fever,
chill, nausea, vomiting, headache, change in vision, loss of
consciousness, or any other concerning symptom, please report to
the emergency room immediately.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 79226**],[**Name11 (NameIs) 79227**] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10508**]
within 2 weeks, and inform them of your stay with us and
