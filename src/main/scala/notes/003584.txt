History of Present Illness:
72 year-old female with past medical hx of Lung CA s/p
lobectomy, CHF, presented from OSH w/resp distress.  She was
found at home in the morning of admission sitting on the couch,
short of breath, right-sided "slouching", hypertensive to
225/110, tachycardic to 110-120s, unresponsive, incontinent of
urine/stool. At OSH was saturating 70% on 12L NC and so was
intubated. Head CT was negative at OSH. She receiving rocephin,
lasix, bumex, lactulose, neomycin. Also received
succinylcholine, fentanyl, and versed peri-intubation.
*
In our ED, she received lasix 60 IV x1 with minimal response,
placed on propofol, and had a CT of her abdomen due to a
distended abdomen. On ROS, family noted PND, chart noted pt w/hx
URI, recent steroids use. Pt's family reports increased cough,
URI symptoms, dizziness, increased sputum. Has multiple URIs,
allergies, recent azithro < 2 weeks ago, prednisone < 1 month
ago.

Pertinent Results:
CT abdomen: Large mass replacing most of the right lobe of the
liver and a second smaller hypodense lesion in the left lobe of
the liver that are incompletely characterized on this
noncontrast study. Fat-containing right-sided abdominal wall
hernia. Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar lung
opacities with possible interlobular septal thickening
consistent with CHF/fluid overload. Air bronchograms present in
the right basilar opacity raise the possibility of a
superimposed infectious process.

MRI abdomen:
1) Giant cavernous hemangioma of the right lobe of the liver
measuring 27.2 x 21.3 x 21.1 cm. A second smaller hemangioma is
seen within the medial segment of the left lobe, measuring 2.3 x
2.5 x 3.1 cm. The hepatic venous and portal venous vasculature
is patent.
2) Bilateral pleural effusions.
3) Lower anterior abdominal wall fat-containing hernia.


Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
Active problems on admssion included 1)hypercarbic respiratory
failure, 2)oliguric acute renal failure, 3)large liver mass seen
on the abdominal CT, 4)intermittent supraventricular
tachycardia, 5)Hypotension.  In terms of respiratory failure, pt
was intubated and was treated for pneumonia, COPD exacerbation,
and +/-CHF.  CXR on admission showed bilateral retrocardiac
opacity and later showed RUL opacity.  Sputum culture from [**6-26**]
grew MRSA.  She was started on Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for empiric
coverage.  She was initially given Lasix 100 mg IV for a concern
for CHF from pulmonary edema seen on CXR but was later thought
unlikely since her CVP was only 10.  She was also started on
steroids for COPD exacerbation.  In the ICU, there was
difficulty extubating secondary to her agitated MS, but was
successfully extubated on [**2175-7-5**].  She was able to maintain
mid-90's on room air.  In terms of ARF, she presented with Cr of
2.3-2.8 and became oliguric and peaked at 3.5.  Renal was
consulted whose impression was oligurid renal failure->ATN from
hypoperfusion +[**Last Name (un) **].  Her urine output picked up and now making
adequate urine.  Her Creatinine normalized to 2.8.  In terms of
22 cm liver mass seen on the abdominal CT, liver team was
consulted.  She has a hx of liver hemangioma and this is likely
the expansion of the hemangioma.  The family and the team
decided to not pursue with any surgical procedure.  She had
episodes of SVT to 140's with hypotension to SBP 80's on [**2175-6-29**]
of what appears as AVNRT.  She was started on Diltiazem and has
been adequately rate controlled.  In terms of hypotension, she
had intermittent episodes of hypotension which appears to be
positional, likely from the liver compressing on IVC?.  This in
addition to the systemic illness may have worsened her renal
failure on admission.  Or she may have had episodes of AVNRT
with hypotension prior to admission to have caused the renal
insult.

Floor Course by problems:
.
1)Respiratory failure: Patient likely had MRSA PNA +/- COPD
exacerbation.  She completed a 14 day course of Vanc which was
dosed by level as she was in oliguric renal failure/ATN.  Pt got
Albuterol/fluticasone and a very short course of steroid taper
for the possible COPD exacerbation.  She was stable on room air
from pulmonary stand point prior to discharge.
.
2)Renal failure: Pt had ischemic ATN in the ICU from presumed
hypoperfusion episode.  She was followed by Renal.  Later, she
started to make adequate urine, and her creatinine eventually
came down to 2.7 which is where it stabilized.  Per her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
baseline PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2.0 in [**2175-3-28**].  Cr 2.7 is likely her new
baseline per renal.  She also developed hypernatremia which was
corrected with IV D5W to correct the free water deficit.  She
also develop metabolic acidosis and was supplemented by sodium
bicarb.  She was continued on Calcitriol and Sevelamer.  Her
Epogen dose was increased to 5000 unit qMWF from 3000 unit.
.
3)Altered MS: Pt was very agitated, confused, and at times
disruptive pulling out her lines.  Her mental status waxed and
wane.  Her delirium was thought likely from toxic metabolic
etiology secondary to combination of hypothyroid, ICU delirium,
steroid use, hypernatremia, and acute infection.  She was
initially kept NPO due to aspiration risk from mental status
change.  She got tubefeed in the ICU and PPN on the floor.  She
initially required frequent PRN Haldol and Zydis for agitation.
However, on [**7-11**] her MS returned to baseline.  She passed
swallow evaluation and was able to tolerate po diet with normal
consistency and thin liquids.
.
4)Hypertension: She was continued on po metorprol and
Hydralazine for BP control.  When she was NPO, she got the IV
version.
.
5)Tacchycardia: Pt had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia,
likely AVNRT, in the ICU which was controlled with Diltiazem
then was switched to metoprolol.  On the floor, she again had an
episode of SVT for 1 hr which was finally broke with IV
Diltiazem.  Her EKG and rhythm strips were reviewed by the EP
team who recommended medical management at this time with a
beta-blocker.  She will follow up with her PCP/Cardiologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding this.  If she continues to have AVNRT
despite maximal medical treatment, elective ablation should be
considered.
.
6)Anemia: Pt has anemia of what appears as chronic illness/renal
disease.  She was intitially on Epogen 3000 unit qMWF, but was
later switched to 4000 unit and then to 5000 unit qMWF by renal.
 She had a very slow decline in Hct and got a total of 4 units
of PRBC during the hospitalization (2 units in the ICU, 2 units
on the floor).  Hct prior to discharge after the transfusion was
stable at 28-29.  She needs to have her Hct checked frequently.
If she continues to have a decline in Hct despite increased
Epogen dose, she would need an outpatient EGD + colonoscopy to
rule out GI bleed.
.
7)Liver mass: Pt with known history of giant liver hemangioma
that was has followed as outpatient.  The CT and MRI of abdomen
again demonstrated giant mass that appears as hemangioma.  AFP
value was normal.  Spoke with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and plan is
to follow closely as outpatient.
.
8)Hypothyroid: Her TSH was elevated, and her free T4 was low as
well.  Her synthroid dose was increased to 50 mcg qd.
