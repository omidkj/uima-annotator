Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim / Cipro

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Right and left bronchial artery embolization by IR using
300-500 embospheres
- Rigid Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69 yo woman with h/o NSCLC s/p XRT and
chemotherapy and recent [**First Name3 (LF) **] placement in the left and right
mainstem bronchi in [**11-18**] and COPD, who presents from home with
hemoptysis. The patient was reportedly in her NSOH until this
evening when she laid down to go to bed at approximately 8:15
PM. She turned onto her left side to sleep and began to cough up
large clots. She states that there was approximately 1 cup of
blood in the sputum. She then ran to the bathroom, where she had
two more such episodes and coughed up approximately another 1
cup of blood. She then vomited and stated that she saw blood in
her vomit. She thus called EMS and was taken to [**Hospital3 **].

.
In the ED, her initial vs were: T 97.4, P 75, BP 108/56, R 20,
O2 99%. She had a CTA, which demonstrated a small outpouching of
soft plaque of the aortic arch, which could represent a
penetrating ulcer in the wall. CT Surgery was called twice;
however, they did not return the page. She was given CTX,
Azithromycin and Ativan and was admitted to the MICU for further
management.


Past Medical History:
NSCLC s/p XRT and chemotherapy
s/p trachial stenting
COPD
Recurrent UTIs
Back injury in [**2072**]
Hysterectomy
.
Of note, in [**Month (only) 1096**], the patient had an episode of syncope when
walking to the bathroom. She thereafter developed stridor and
was found to have a large mass compressing the distal trachea
and mainstem bronchi. She was thus admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) **] for tracheal and bilateral mainstem bronchi [**Date range (1) **]
placements. The procedure was complicated by migration of the
tracheal [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was taken back to the OR for a repeat
rigid bronchoscopy with creation of a piecemeal Y [**First Name3 (LF) **]. She was
thereafter stabalized and was discharged home with supplemental
O2 with a plan for a repeat bronchoscopy next week. Of note, she
was also scheduled to begin another round of chemotherapy
tomorrow.


Social History:
Lives with one of her sons (3 sons). She is a retired social
worker. She has a 40pck/y quit 2 years ago and she denies EtOH.

Family History:
Her mother, grandmother, and two sisters died from CVAs. Her
mother also had CHF.

CXR:
1. Known left lung cancer with persistent left upper lung
collapse and hazy opacity at the lung base could be from
radiation or aspiration.
2. Right basal atelectasis or aspiration.
.
CTA CHEST W/ W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Incidental small outpouching in the aortic arch likely
ulcerated plaque.
3. Tracheal and bilateral bronchus [**Year/Month/Day **] in place.
4. Persistent occlusion of the superior segmental bronchus of
the left lower lobe and left upper lobe bronchus.
5. Persistent opacities in the left lung, could be aspiration or
radiation
changes.
6. RLL opacities less apparent could be atelectasis or
aspiration.
.
EMBOLIZATION PROCEDURE:
FINDINGS:
1. Aortogram demonstrates conventional anatomy. Multiple
intercostal
branches seen arising from the aorta. Bronchial arteries were
not visualized.
2. Right intercostal bronchial trunk angiogram reveals a branch
supplying the left lung. Successful embolization performed using
300 to 500 micron
Embospheres.
3. Selective left intercostal bronchial trunk arteriogram and
embolization
using 300 to 500 micron Embospheres.
4. No contributor to the anterior spinal artery is seen.
5. No anomalus bronchial arterial supply arising off the left
subclavian or left internal mammary arterial branch is seen.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
immediate
complications.
IMPRESSION: Successful right and left bronchial arteriograms and
embolization using 300 to 500 micron Embospheres.
.
CXR [**1-14**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2102-1-13**]:
Greater consolidation in the left lung is probably due to
worsening
aspiration, although new edema is seen in the right lung. Large
post-treatment atelectasis in the left lung and residual left
hilar mass are more prominent, probably because of differences
in positioning. The right bronchial [**Year (4 digits) **] may have migrated
superiorly and to the left since the previous study. Tracheal
[**Year (4 digits) **] position is unchanged, as is a left bronchial [**Year (4 digits) **].



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 69 yo woman with h/o end-stage NSCLC s/p XRT
and radiation and recent tracheal and bilateral mainstem bronchi
stents who presented from home with large-volume hemoptysis, now
s/p embolization of right and left mainstem bronchus.
.
#. Hemoptysis: Patient was urgently transferred to the ICU. Her
Hct has remained at her baseline of 33, and she had no further
episodes of hemoptysis while in the ICU.  Interventional
pulmonary performed a rigid bronchoscopy, which revealed a large
volume of blood in the left lung that coould not be interevened
upon.  Patient was then taken to IR and right and left bronchial
artery embolization was performed using 300-500 embospheres.
After the embolization, hematocrits remained stable at 29-33.
She had no further episodes of bright red hemoptysis.  Her cough
was prdocutive of rust-colored sputum and she had no
signs/symptoms of active bleeding for the remainder of the
admission.  In order to help her SOB and thick  secretions, she
was started on morphine liquid 5 mg as needed, which greatly
improved her symptoms.  She will be discharged on this
medication.  She will also be discharged with a letter which
explains the prcoedures that were done, what to do for another
significant large bleed, the patient's wishes, and emergency
contact information.
.
#. NSCLC: Patient has history of NSCLC, followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 636**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 116**] at the [**Location (un) **] Hematology/[**Hospital **] clinic.  She is s/p
trachial y-stenting in [**Month (only) 1096**] and was supposed to have another
round of chemotherapy on [**1-13**].  Palliative care was consulted
after patient's recovery and it was decided by the patient and
patient's family that she would go home with hospice.  She will
follow-up with her oncologist the d
