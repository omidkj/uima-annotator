Chief Complaint:
Dysphagia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. [**2181-6-22**] - minimally invasive esophagectomy


History of Present Illness:
    Mr. [**Known lastname 19862**] is a 61-year-old man with progressive dysphagia.
He has had an abnormal barium swallow,was found to have
adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal
junction, which is biopsy-proven positive.  He had a CT
scan,which shows no evidence of nodal disease.  There was a 3 to
4 cm segment of wall thickening at the gastroesophageal
junction.  He had a PET-CT, which showed no evidence of
metastatic disease and an endoscopic ultrasound, which showed a
very long segment of at least 3 cm in length, which was at least
a T2, the possibility
of a T3 lesion could not be completely excluded.  There were no
obvious nodes on endoscopic ultrasound. He also acknowledged
having lost [**10-22**] pounds. Mr. [**Known lastname 19862**] completed chemoradiation
which allowed him to eat better and gain
approximately 10 pounds. His recent PET scan showed decreased
amounts of avidity of the eprimary mass and no evidence of
metastatic disease.

[**2181-6-27**] Pathology Specimen: Adenocarcinoma, poorly
differentiated, signet ring cell type, with invasion into the
subserosal soft tissue (ypT3); see synoptic report.Seven of
seventeen regional lymph nodes with involvement by carcinoma
([**7-24**]-ypN3).Resection margins free of carcinoma.Lymph nodes,
station 7, excision (AF-AG):Six lymph nodes with no carcinoma
seen (0/6). No HER2-neu gene amplification was observed for this
specimen

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the  Surgical Service for evaluation
and treatment.  On [**2181-6-22**], the patient underwent a minimally
invasive esophagectomy, which went well without complication
(reader referred to the Operative Note for details). The patient
was in the ICU afterwards because of a collapsed right lung with
oxygen desaturation. This required a right chest tube to be
inserted in addition to the black drain he already had on that
side. Additionally the patient developed atrial fibrillation in
the ICU that was controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol. As
his oxygen saturation improved in the ICU he was transferred to
the floor NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley
catheter. The patient was hemodynamically stable. His course on
the floor was as follows:

Neuro: The patient received oxycodone with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint. He was continued on amiodarone and metoprolol. He
stayed in NSR with PVC on the floor.He was asymptomatic.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.He arrived to the floor
with a JP drain and a chest tube to water suction. One chest
tube had an air leak and required pleurodesis. The patient
tolerated this procedure well. In the following days the chest
tube no longer had an air leak and both chest tubes were
removed.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. He was started on tube feeds, and diet was advanced when
appropriate, which was well tolerated.  Patient's intake and
output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when
necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted
when necessary.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating his diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan. He was discharged home on
oxygen and nursing services.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after undergoing a minimally invasive
esophagectomy for your esophageal cancer. You were then admitted
to  the ICU because of a collapsed lung. You had a chest tubes
inserted in addition to the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain that you already had in
place. You were then transferred to west 3 surgery and were
followed by the surgery and thoracics team. You underwent
pleurodiesis for a persistent air leak from your chest tube.
COnsequently your chest tubes stopped leaking and were removed.
You have tolerated this procedure and are now ready to be
discharged home on oxygen.

Please resume all regular home medications unless specifically
advised not to take a particular medication.  Also, please take
any new medications as prescribed.
Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times
per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids.  Avoid lifting
weights greater than [**5-17**] lbs until you follow-up with your
surgeon, who will instruct you further regarding activity
restrictions.
Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain
medications.
