History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13621**] is a 55 year old woman with adenocarcinoma of unknown
primary (s/p six cycles of gemcitabine/irinotecan and two cycles
of Xelox, last cycle [**2181-11-14**]) who developed acute shortness of
breath this morning. EMS was called and found her to have
tachycardia to 180-200; she was given 6mg adenosine with some
slowing, and they determined the rhythm to be atrial flutter.
She was given an additional 5mg lopressor with rates decreased
to the 130-150. On oxygen 4L at baseline.
.
In the ED, her heart rate was in the 150's, and she did not
receive any further rate control. Bedside [**Month/Day/Year 113**] revealed a
moderate pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade or RV
strain. She received a dose of ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and
azithromycin for CAP + post-obstructive pneumonia, as well as
nebulizers and solumedrol x 1.
.
Of note, she underwent her second cycle of Xelox on [**11-14**]. She
was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-11**] after right chest
thoracentesis and placement of chest tube for pneumothorax s/p
throacentesis. She had been off her Lovenox for approximately 6
days.
.
Oncologic history: Initially had syncope, and
pericardial/pleural effusion discovered [**2181-5-10**]. Fluid revealed
metastatic adenocarcinoma and pericardial fluid revealed
well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. She has had
multiple admissions for dizziness/syncope and dyspena. She had
pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy with removal of
520cc of bloody fluid on [**6-6**]. Given location of effusions, a
subtle gastric or pancreatico/biliary tumor was suspected, and
she underwent 6 cycles of gemcitabine/irinotecan. She has had
bilateral pleurex catheters. She has a history of DVT/PE in [**Month (only) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary
55yF with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary presenting with
tachycardia and shortness of breath.
.
#) Dyspnea. This was felt to be due to known pleural and
pericardial effusions with associated SVT. At the time of
admission, there was no evidence of tamponade or worsening
pleural effusion on CXR. The patient has a history of DVT/PE
from earlier this year, but did not have evidence of right heart
strain on [**Month/Day/Year 113**], was continued on her home anticoagulation and
has an IVC filter in place. She was treated with azithromycin
and ceftriaxone for a possible CAP and nebs plus short steriod
taper as she has a history of asthma. The patient's shortness of
breath responded well to supplemental O2 and low-dose morphine.
Her rate was controlled at her baseline of 115-120. She was
discharged to home with azithromycin to complete a 14 day
course.
.
#) Tachycardia. The patient is tachycardic at baseline around
115-120. On the day of admission and again on [**2181-11-18**], the
patient had an additionally elevated rate to the 160s. This
responded in a moderate fashion to IV adenosine, metoprolol and
diltiazem; the patient was transitioned to PO diltiazem. The
patient's tachycardia was thought to be related to her shortness
of breath, pleural effusion and advanced disease state.
.
#) Adenocarcinoma. The patient's primary oncologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], was involved in her care from the time of admission.
Xeloda was initially while in intensive care an was restarted
when returning to the oncology service. She was discharged to
home with services and plan for follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
