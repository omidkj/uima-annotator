Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, GI bleed following cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the ramus
coronary artery
Endoscopy with Angioectasia with stigmata of recent bleeding was
seen in the duodenal bulb, treated with [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery


History of Present Illness:
80 M with history of severe AS ([**6-/2114**] - [**Location (un) 109**] 1.1, mean gradient
22.3), CAD s/p 3V-CABG (SVG to RCA, LAD and OM1), HTN, sCHF EF
15-20%, ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p ICD placement presents
initially to [**Hospital3 **] for increasing chest pain at home
starting about 10 PM.  In the OSH ED, HR was 117-140, was given
lopressor 5mg IV x 2, ASA, plavix, heparin bolus, MSO4 2mg IV,
and lasix 40mg IV with 600 cc of urine output.  He was brought
to cath lab for concern for STEMI.  RCA graft was found to be
patent, other grafts remain occluded.  During cath, his heart
rate switched into 70's.  His chest pain improved, last rated at
[**2113-3-2**].  Last vitals prior to transfer were: BP 117/64, HR 60s,
O2 Sat 90s on 2L
.
Over the last year, he has developed marked fatigue and
occasional shortness of breath with exertion.  TTE on [**2114-7-16**]
showed mean AV gradient 22.3 mmHg, [**Location (un) 109**] 1.1 cm2.  Also showed a
severely dilated LV, moderate size apical aneurysm, severe
global hypokinesis, septal and apical akinesis, LVEF of ~16%.
During the cath the [**Location (un) **] was estimated to be 0.7 cm2 with a
gradient of 41.
.
He had been admitted in [**10/2114**] to [**Hospital3 **] for chest pain.
ECG at the time showed marked ST elevation in the precordial
leads, however, his enzymes were negative.  Stress test was
negative for angina or ECG signs of ischemia.  Cardiac cath on
[**2114-11-23**] showed  severe three vessel disease.  There was total
occlusion of the mid LAD, collateralization of the distal LAD
that was collateralized by the RCA, the left circumflex was
calcified with an ostial 90% occlusion, the first OMB had a 90%
stenosis, the RCA has a 70% diffuse stenosis.  The SVG to the
RCA was patent.   The SVG to the LAD was totally occluded, and
the SVG to the OMB was totally occluded.  He was considered for
repeat CABG at the time but no additional plans were made.
.
Initially was planned for aortic valvuloplasty, but right heart
cath showed that his wedge was 7.  It was thought that AS was
not the cause of his symptoms.  Found to have 90% calcified
lesion in ostial and mid ramus.  Rotoblation was performed with
DES x2 deployed.  He was transferred back to [**Wardname 13764**] for
monitoring.
.
After cath, he was noted to have [**6-2**] bloody bowel movements.
Patient triggered for hypotension to the 70s, tachycardic to the
140s.  Was given 500 cc bolus with improvement of heart rate to
70s.  Started on peripheral levophed with BP responding to
110-120s.  Transferred back to CCU.  Patient had been mentating
well despite hypotension.  Complains of some nausea, no chest
pain, no abdominal pain, no flank pain, no pain at sites of
cath.

Studies:
Echo [**3-/2115**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20-25%) secondary to dyskinesis of the distal septum and
apex, akinesis of the basal-mid anterior septum and distal
anterior wall and mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining
segments. The estimated cardiac index is borderline low
(2.0-2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler
