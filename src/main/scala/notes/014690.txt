Brief Hospital Course:
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course will be categorized by the

83 yo F s/p fall down 4stairs w/+LOC. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
multiple facial/nasal fractures, Left wrist/distal radius
fracture. GCS 15 in route. Hemodynamically stable in ED. Lac on
lip sutured at outside hospital.
L PCA stroke- enlarged on/heparin gtt (w/epistaxis) Found
unresponsive [**12-18**], emergent Trach. s/p formal trach and peg
[**12-19**]. Difficult L SC access, has picc in place. Hep gtt bleed;
MRSA + on nasal swab ;
Several episodes of mucus plugging w/sob over [**Date range (1) 59877**]
resulting in transfer to stepdown bed.
GI called due to bright red blood in PEG and rectal tube, Hct
drop. PEG didnt clear with lavage..
We did EGD in unit, showed clot behind internal bumper of
pEG(Put in by either [**Doctor First Name **] or pulm but not us),likely secondary
to bumper being too tight causing necrosis. We loosened it by
0.5 cms. Good pictures on gmed.
Hematocrit values were followed throughout her stay.

Patient also followed by pulmonary service during her stay:
83F [**Hospital 23789**] transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with face/neck/wrist
fractures on [**12-15**], found to have L PCA stroke which progressed,
c/b unresponsiveness on [**12-19**] requiring urgent tracheostomy with
revision and PEG the following day. Has had L retrocardiac
opacity since then with persistently elevated wbc. Sputum cx
grew MRSA and she has been on vanco/levo x 9d, still with thick
yellow secretions + high wbc although afebrile. On trachmask 40%
but sats 99% last few days with on episodes of desats. Also has
LUE clot for which she cannot go on heparin now b/c of CVA
worsening. Consult requested for possible bronch given ? of
yeast on sputum cultures. On exam seems extremely volume
overloaded with bronchial breath sounds on L base.
Diuresed appropriately with lasix. Daily weights followed,
respiratory status improved though still requiring suctioning
every 4-6 hours.

Patient also followed by orthoapedics for left radius fracture
that was repaired in the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Patient to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within one to two weeks after discharge
and to continue wearing cast.

Patient also followed by cardiology during her stay and the
following recommendations were followed.
Patient placed on telemetry, ECG, ACE inhibitor started,
atorvastatin started.

Patient followed also by nephrology service for rising
creatinine.
Cr 1.2-->2.4 and facing a cranial angio to r/o vertebral
dissection
1. ARF 2.4-->1.7 ---> 1.6 and good UOP
2. hemorrhage into L occipital infarct--off heparin now,
awaiting cerebral angio for possible vertebral dissection

Also followed by neurology stroke service for likely occipital
infarct.
[**12-18**]: MRI/MRA performed, MRI shows occipital infarct with small
amount of hemorrhage into the infarct. MRA with fat sats poor
quality, still cannot determine if there is dissection
[**12-18**] pm: pt acutely developed resp distress, unable to be
intubated given fx's, emergent trach placed, transferred to ICU.

Since then has been in ICU, stabilzed, on ASA not heparin.
Responsive on exam but relatively unchanged.
[**12-21**] pt transferred to the floor in stable condition
