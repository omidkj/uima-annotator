HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 620**] is a
70-year-old right-handed male with history of hypertension
(diagnosed five years ago), diabetes mellitus (since two
years ago) and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin for one month
now, who underwent elective cardioversion at [**Location (un) 511**]
observed overnight and discharged around 4 p.m. the next day.
Transesophageal echocardiogram, prior to cardioversion, was
within normal limits.  He went from the hospital to his
orthopedist's office for routine follow-up appointment (he
had undergone total knee replacement one month prior to
admission).  While sitting in the waiting room, he suddenly
slumped over to his right side, and he was not moving his
yes or no.  CT scan was negative for hemorrhage.  INR was
1.4.  He was given 90 mg of IV TPA approximately 70 minutes
after the onset of symptoms.  He was also given Labetalol for
elevated blood pressures to 192/109 mmHg.

On transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] early
on the morning of admission, he was briefly arousable,
consistently answering with yes or no and not following any
commands.  He had a left gaze preference and a flaccid right
arm.  Since arrival at [**Hospital1 69**]
the blood pressure has been stable around 120s to 170s.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History is as described above.  He had
a total knee replacement on [**2177-2-19**] and it was
during his preoperative evaluation for this that the atrial
fibrillation was noted.  Medications, prior to admission,
were the following:

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glucophage.
2.  Accupril.
3.  Coumadin.
4.  Betapace.

ALLERGIES:  The patient does not have any drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoker and drinks
occasional alcohol.  He lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 41366**]
and owns his own limousine business.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, during
admission, he was afebrile.  Blood pressure was 131/70 mmHg.
Heart rate was 94 per minute and respiratory rate was 17 per
minute.  He had no carotid bruits.  CARDIAC:   Cardiac
examination revealed regular rate and rhythm without any
clicks or murmurs.  LUNGS:  Lungs were clear bilaterally with
good air entry.  EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well perfused with
positive pulses and brisk capillary refill without edema.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was sleepy and briefly opened his
eyes to loud voice.  His right eye lid was ptotic.  He could
hardly open it.  He could lift his left eye lid.  He
occasionally said no to questions, but had no other speech
output.  He was not able to follow axial commands.  Pupils
were equal bilaterally, 3 -mm and sluggishly reactive to
2-mm.  Eyes were mid position with occasional roving
movements.  He was able to move to the left with ocular
cephalics, but not to the right.  He did not have any blink
to threat from the right side.  He had right facial droop.
He was able to purposefully move his left arm.  There was
minimal internal rotation of the right shoulder to noxious
stimulus.  The left leg moved spontaneously.  The right leg
was externally rotated, but he did withdraw to pain.  Deep
tendon reflexes were 2+ in the left upper extremity and knee
and absent on the right.  Ankle jerks were absent.  Plantar
response was weakly extensor on the left and obvious extensor
on the right side.

MR imaging of the brain revealed a large area of restrictive
diffusion in the left frontal temporal parietal lobes
consistent with a left MCA territory infarct on DWI series.
MRA of the brain revealed complete occlusion of the left M1
segment of the middle cerebral artery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 620**] is a 70-year-old gentleman with
a large left MCA infarct after 30 hours after elective
cardioversion for atrial fibrillation, was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6
Neurology Service for further assessment and management of
left MCA territory infarct.  Since he had a relatively large
MCA territory infarct, his blood pressures were maintained
between 140 to 160 mmHg and for blood pressures greater than
200/100 treatment is initiated with Lopressor 5 mg IV every
six hours as needed.  He received isotonic fluids only
(normal saline with 20 of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] as maintenance).  He was
followed up with frequent neurological checks.
Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed dilated left atrium;
mild spontaneous echocontrast seen in the body of the left
atrium; mild spontaneous echocontrast was seen in the left
atrial appendage.  No thrombus was seen in the left atrial
appendage.  No spontaneous echocontrast or thrombus was seen
in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial
appendage.  There was significant regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction.  Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities included akinesis of the mid and distal
anterior and septal walls and apex.  The apex was not
adequately visualized in order to exclude a mural thrombus.
The mid and distal inferior walls were hypokinetic.  The
remaining left ventricular segments contracted normally.  The
ascending, transverse, and descending thoracic aorta were
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaques.
There were three aortic valve leaflets.  The aortic valve
leaflets were mildly thickened.  Trace aortic regurgitation
was seen.  Mitral valve leaflets were structurally normal.
There was mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.  There was no clear
effusion.  Echocardiogram repeated on [**2177-4-11**] did
not show any significant changes from the previous study.
The patient, on admission, also had elevated creatinine
kinase and troponin levels.  On admission, the initial
troponin level was 13.3, and the creatinine phosphokinase
level was 174 on [**2177-3-30**].  The second troponin level
on [**2177-3-31**] at midnight was 10.7 and creatinine
phosphokinase level was 144.  The third study of troponin on
[**2177-3-31**] at 6 a.m. was 8.1 and creatinine
phosphokinase MB was 1.0.  Creatinine phosphokinase level was
117.

The patient was started on aspirin 325 mg daily and heparin
5000 units subcutaneously twice daily for deep venous
thrombosis prophylaxis, as well as pneumoboots.  The patient
also had gastrointestinal prophylaxis with Ranitidine.  The
patient did not show much improvement neurologically,
however, general status was within normal limits.  Because he
failed swallow test, it was decided to have a
gastrojejunostomy tube placed.

On Apri 4th, [**2176**], the patient was still having atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and premature
ventricular contractions or aberrant ventricular conduction
with long QTC intervals and left axis deviation.  The white
blood cell count was 11.8, hemoglobin last labs are the
following:  CBC.9, hematocrit 34.4, platelet count 240,000,
PT 18.5, PTT 32.1, INR 2.4.  The CPK was 44 and troponin was
6.4.

Under these circumstances, the patient underwent G-J tube
placement and tolerated the procedure well.  However, that
night he developed some gastric hemorrhage and later on
started having low blood pressures.  Since the blood
pressures could not be controlled with medical measures on
the floor, he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
vasopressor [**Doctor Last Name 360**] administration and control of his
homostasis.  The patient was started on IV Protonix twice
daily for better GI prophylaxis.  He also received vitamin K
and fresh-frozen plasma.  Also, aspirin and Coumadin were held.
During his stay at the ICU, the patient also had an elevated
sodium of 155 for which he received free water boluses.
However, consequently the mental status started declining and
he became somnolent.  The CT scan revealed increasing edema
and midline shift most probably secondary to hypotonic
fluids, diffusing into the large stroke area.  He was started
on monitor and over the course of three days, edema and
midline shift corrected and his neurological condition
improved dramatically.  The patient, from then on, started
improving daily, and on [**2177-4-11**], he was transferred
