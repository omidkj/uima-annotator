CXR: FINDINGS: Portable upright AP chest radiograph is obtained.
When compared with the prior radiograph there is interval
increase in left basilar opacity compatible with effusion and
likely post-obstructive atelectasis or pneumonia. Increased
vague opacity in the left mid lung is also concerning for post-
obstructive pneumonia. Left hilar mass is suboptimally assessed.
Right lung remains clear.
IMPRESSION: Post-obstructive pneumonia and atelectasis in the
left mid and
lower lung with associated effusion.
.
CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Left hilar mass results in total occlusion of the left upper
lobe bronchus and near complete obstruction of the lingular
bronchus. Probable
postobstructive atelectasis and pneumonia is present within the
left upper
lobe with probable lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the left upper
lobe.
3. Increased bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacification in the right lung and left lower
lobe concerning for a small airways disease process including
aspiration and/or infection.
5. Marked attenuation of the pulmonary arteries supplying the
left upper lobe and lingula. Unchanged thrombus in the left
superior pulmonary vein.
6. New T11 pathologic compression fracture with slight
retropulsion of the
vertebral body into the canal. Unchanged T10 metastasis. MR is
recommended to for further evaluation of the spinal cord.

Arterial Embolization Report3/11/09:
Tumor blush was visualized at the left hilar mass. The left
bronchial artery feeding to the tumor at the left hilum, was
embolized with  particles until stagnation of the flow.

CXR [**2178-3-26**]: No pneumothorax. Left pleural effusion decreased


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 year old family who presented from home with
hemoptysis.

# Hemoptysis: This was likely secondary to bleeding from
patient's lung cancer which is now obstructing his left main
bronchus. On admission hematocrit was 19 and patient transfused
two units. He was observed to have continued hemoptysis and
required an additional two units of blood. Patient underwent
flexible bronchoscopy on [**2178-3-23**] by interventional pulmonology
with APC to active bleeding on tumor site. Interventional
pulmonology recommended left pulmonary artery embolization in
order to more effectively prevent tumor bleeding. On [**2178-3-24**]
patient underwent left artery embolization by interventional
radiology with good effect. Patient's hemoptysis has nearly
resolved at time of discharge. Patient's aspirin is being held
given his risk of bleeding.

# Hypoxia/Post-Obstructive Pneumonia/Bilateral Pleural
Effusions: On admission patient determined to have
postobstructive atelectasis and pneumonia on chest CT. PNA
initially treated with unasyn and transitioned to levaquin for a
total of 10 day course. Sputum cultures have grown mixed oral
flora. Hypoxia improved with treatment of PNA. In addition
patient noted to have bilateral pleural effusions. He underwent
therapeutic thoracentesis on [**2178-3-26**] with good effect however
fluid re-accumulated and patient underwent placement of a PleurX
cathether on [**2178-3-30**] which can continue to be drained. Patient
is sating in the mid to high 90's on 2 liters of oxygen at time
of discharge. Oxygen via nasal cannula should continue to be
weaned as tolerated to maintain sats >93%.

# Atrial fibrillation: Patient noted to be in atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to 150's. Patient
treated with bolus doses of intravenous metoprolol and oral
metoprolol titrated up to 100mg TID (100mg [**Hospital1 **] at home).
Patient was also continued on his outpatient regimen of digoxin.
Heart has stabilized in the high 90's and blood pressure has
remained stable.

# Pancytopenia: Likely secondary to recent treatment with
pemetrexed (last dose [**2178-3-12**]). [**Known lastname 1007**] blood cell count has risen
to normal range. Platelet count is is trending up.  Would
anticipate that platelet would continue to increase.
