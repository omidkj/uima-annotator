Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6743**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
paracentesis
exploratory laparotomy, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, partial omentectomy, pelvic mass
resection for large mass from R ovary.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 y/o woman with no known past medical history (she
has not had medical care in about 20 years), who presented to
the ED at an OSH complaining of abdominal pain.  She says she
was getting out of the shower when she all of a sudden developed
a [**9-27**] pressure like abdominal pain.  She denies any nausea,
vomiting associated with the pain, was not eating at the time.
The pain was so severe she became diaphoretic.  She has never
had this abdominal pain before.  She denies any chest pain,
shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, fevers.  She states
that she feels that her abdomen has been growing slowly over the
last 6 months, and had attributed it to weight gain, although
she had only gained three pounds over this period of time.  She
denies any family history of breast or ovarian cancer.
.
The only other time she had been in the hospital was when she
gave birth.  Of note, she was recently treated at a walk in
clinic for a UTI with nitrofurantoin.  Because she still wasnt
feeling well after the course of nitrofurantoin, she returned to
clinic where they gave her two days of ciprofloxacin.
.
In the ED at the OSH, she had an abdominal ultrasound which
showed a ascites.  This prompted a CT scan which was notable for
a complex cystic low abdominal and pelvic mass, measuring 16 x
16.5 x 11.5 cm, positioned superior to the uterus.
.
She was admitted to the OSH, and overnight, she developed a
leukocytosis to 23,600, up from 11,000 on admission with a
bandemia of 25%.  She was started on levo/vanco/flagyl.  Her
creatinine was noted to increase from baseline of 0.8 on
admission to 2.8 ([**2-10**] at 6:45).  Bicarbonate decreased from 24
--> 16.  Her blood pressures transiently decreased to SBP of the
70s, and she was started on a dopamine gtt (1 mcg/min).  She
received one dose of mucomyst at 1700.  Was started on NS with 2
amps of bicarb at 250cc/hr for 800cc.
.
On arrival, the patient denied shortness of breath. She denied
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. She denied fevers, chills,
sweats. She denied diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena. Her
last episode of hematuria was ~1-2 weeks ago.
.
ROS: She denies lightheadedness, palpitations. She denies chest
pain. She denies weakness, blurry vision.

Social History:

ago.  She drinks socially and has never had a problem with
alcohol abuse.  She lives with her husband at home.   Has one
child who is alive and well.  She used to work as a telephone
operator.
.


Family History:
She has a father who died of lung disease at 59 and a mother who
died of "[**Last Name **] problem" at 70s. She has no FH of breast or
ovarian cancer.

[**2141-2-9**]: CXR: LLL atelectasis
.
[**2141-2-9**]: Abd US: Multiple shadowing gallstones. GB wall not
thickened. IH ducts not dilated. Common hepatic duct 4mm.
Ascites
.
[**2141-2-9**]: 1301: CT abd/pelvis with contrast - complex cystic and
solid irregular mass - midline low abdomen and pelvis -
16x16.5x11.5cm. Irregularly enhancing mural components and
several low attenuation areas within the complex fluid
commponents. Extensive ascites. Midline uterus. Mild small bowel
dilatation. Kidneys normal without hydro/masses
.
ECG: HR 101, sinus tachycardia, normal intervals, no ST
depressions, normal axis, no q waves.  No ECG available for
comparison.

ECG: here - sinus tach 111, nl axis, interval, sl peaked T waves
in V2, otherwise no acute ST T wave changes
.
CXR: left sided pleural effusion. mild vascular congestion
.
[**2141-2-11**] CT head
1.9 x 1.7 cm hyperdense, likely extra-axial lesion seen to the
right of the cerebellum, most likely representing meningioma.
Comparison with prior studies if available would be helpful.  If
none are available, MRI would be recommended for further
evaluation.  MRI would also be more sensitive in the evaluation
for potential metastases.
*
[**2141-2-22**] EKG
Sinus rhythm
Poor R wave progression - possible old anteroseptal myocardial
infarction
Low QRS voltage in limb leads Nonspecific T wave changes
Since previous tracing of [**2141-2-10**], sinus tachycardia absent, and
further T
waves changes seen
*
[**2141-2-23**] LENI
No evidence of right or left lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis.
*
[**2141-2-26**] CXR
Large right pleural effusion has increased slightly since [**2-22**] with
worsening of right basilar atelectasis.  Smaller left pleural
effusion is
unchanged.  Upper lungs show vascular redistribution but no
indication of
pneumonia.  Heart size is slightly larger today, but difficult
to assess and the presence of adjacent pleural effusion.  There
is no mediastinal vascular engorgement to suggest elevated
central venous pressure.  No pneumothorax.
