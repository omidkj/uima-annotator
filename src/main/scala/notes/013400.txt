Pertinent Results:
[**2127-7-28**] Echo: PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a subtle focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
markedly dilated There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric and directed
away from the anterior mitral leaflet.. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified
in person of the results in the operating room at the time of
the study.
POST BYPASS Normal right ventricular systolic function. Low
normal left ventricular systolic function (EF = 50%). There is
graft material in situ in the ascending aorta. There is now
trace to mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation
remains. No other significant changes from the pre bypass study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing complete
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On [**7-28**] she was brought
directly to the operating room where she underwent a ascending
aorta and hemi-arch replacement. Please see operative note for
surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. On
post-operative day one she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated.  She was transferred to the
floor on POD 1, however, returned to the CVICU for hypoxia and
atrial fibrillation.  Amiodarone and diltiazem were started for
atrial fibrillation.  The patient was electively reintubated for
ARDS.  She failed many weaning trials and the interventional
pulmonary service was consulted.  She was found to have
tracheo-bronchial malacia.  On [**8-4**] she underwent bronchial
Y-stent placement under rigid bronchoscopy with the IP team.
Diamox was started for metabolic acidosis, which did improve.
The patient was subsequently weaned from the ventillator again.
She developed an intractable cough initially and was planned to
have removal of the bronchial stent.  However, this cough
improved with tessalon perles as well as codeine and it was
decided to give the stent the full two week trial that IP
suggested.  The patient was cleared by physical therapy.  She
was cleared by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for discharge to home with VNA
services.  She will be discharged on coumadin for atrial
fibrillation.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 916**] (PCP) will be called and requested to
manage INR/coumadin dosing.  The patient is discharged home with
appropriate follow up instructions.
