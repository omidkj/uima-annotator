.
[**2105-5-12**]: STRESS
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nuclear
report sent separately.
.
[**2105-5-12**] pMIBI
IMPRESSION: Unchanged multiple moderate to severe fixed defects,
without significant change since the prior study, primarily
involving the distal anterior wall, apex and septum. Global
hypokinesis with dyskinesis of the apex, with the LVEF of 29%.
.
[**2105-5-8**] ABDOMINAL US
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilated intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts as well as
dilated pancreatic duct. Likely hypoechoic mass in the region of
the pancreatic head. Further evaluation with CT is recommended.
2. Hepatic hemangioma.
.
[**2105-5-11**] CT abd w/wo contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Hypoenhancing pancreatic head mass causing narrowing of the
common bile duct stent as well as pancreatic ductal dilatation,
highly concerning for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, the
SMV and SMA are unaffected and there is no pathologic
lymphadenopathy. No definitely suspicious hepatic lesions.
2. Three peripherally enhancing hepatic lesions most likely
represent
hemangiomas.
3. Progressive enlargement of right renal lower pole hyperdense
lesion.
4. Cardiomegaly with probable right heart strain.
.
ERCP [**5-11**]: stent placed, CBD brushings: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT
CELLS consistent with adenocarcinoma.
.
LIVER/GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND [**5-30**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval development of gallbladder distension, wall
thickening and pericholecystic edema, which may be seen in a
setting of ascites, cholecystitis cannot be entirely excluded.
Extrahepatic CBD stent incompletely visualized. No intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation.
.
MR BRAIN [**5-31**]:
IMPRESSION: Infra and suprtentorial multiple subcentimeter foci
of increased FLAIR and restricted diffusion, likely consitent
with thromboembolic acute/subacute ischemic changes, the
possibility of tumoral embolization is a consideration.


Brief Hospital Course:
ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS
The patient presented with fever and RUQ pain; a RUQ ultrasound
showed acute cholecystitis. Surgery evaluated the patient, but
since he was not a surgical candidate, the gallbladder was
drained percutaneously by IR. The acute cholecystitis did not
appear to be secondary to the stent obstruction that was revised
on [**5-23**], because the LFTs had been trending downward since the
procedure, indicating that the revised stent was not obstructed.
The patient was given flagyl and levaquin for anaerobic and gram
negative coverage.
.
ABDOMINAL DISTENTION / ILEUS
The patient did not appear to have an SBO on imaging.  His ileus
on radiography was presumed secondary to cholecystitis.  An NG
tube was placed at continuous suction.
.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS / DYSPHASIA
MRI showed multiple foci of decreased perfusion that were
consistent with embolic infarcts, either from the tumor itself
or another source.  Delirium was also considered in the ddx due
to the waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] nature of the symptoms.
.
ELEVATED TROPONIN
Despite the elevated troponins, there was no chest pain or EKG
changes and other cardiac enzymes returned negative.  Findings
were not felt to be due to ACS.
.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Considered to be pre-renal and caused by CHF.
.
GOALS OF CARE
On HD 3 patient became less responsive.  Goals of care were
addressed with patient's family and the decision was made for
comfort measures only.  At time of transfer to the medical
floors, he was minimally responsive to verbal commands (would
squeeze fist and move toes on command) and could not move the
right half of his body.  All laboratory and d
