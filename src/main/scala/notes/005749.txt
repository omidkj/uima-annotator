Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with Biliary stent placement
Right Internal Jugular Central Venous Line Placement
Midline venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 68 year old female with (per OSH records) history
of HTN, bipolar disorder, ? ESRD on HD, CAD s/p PCI, and COPD
who was transferred from an OSH this morning for management of
septic shock, thought secondary to ascending cholangitis.  Per
records, patient, who lives in nursing home, was found to have
episodes of nausea and vomiting at her nursing home with
associated fever.  She was noted to be hypotensive, EMS was
called, and upon arriving at scene, found patient to be
"unconscious" with SBP in the 50s.  Baseline mental status is
unable to be determined at this time.  She received 1 liter NS
enroute to OSH ED.  In the ED, patient remained unresponsive
with hemodynamic instability, and a right femoral line was
placed, and norepi was started.
.
Initial labs showed creatinine of 2.6, t. bil of 5, AST 470, ALT
227, alk phs 422.  trop T 0.21.  BNP > [**Numeric Identifier **].  WBC 17.5, 64%
polys, 19% bands.  INR 1.4.  U/A showed 21-30 WBCs and 1 blood
culture grew out GNRs.  lipase 42.
.
Following admission, she received vancomycin and zosyn.  She was
also started on pantoprazole IV.  CT scan showed GB distention
with pericholecystic fluid, CBD dilated to 10 mm with 8 mm
high-density filling defect in distal CBD, with intrahepatic
bile ducts were also dilated.  There was a question of portal
vein thrombosis.  GI was consulted, and suggested stablizing
patient prior to MRCP or ERCP.  Cardiology was also consulted ->
her cath films were reviewed, and she was noted to have ectatic,
dilated coronaries; stents were patent (unsure of anatomy).
Patient was improved hemodynamically, and transfer was arranged
directly to MICU to facilitate ERCP.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient was alert to name, not
following commands.  She was unable to provide any history.
Attempt was made to contact next of [**Doctor First Name **].
