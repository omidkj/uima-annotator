Brief Hospital Course:
Patient had a NSTEMI on admission. Over the weekend, the
decision had been to watch him since he was chest pain free and
his Cr was rising. However, he eventually developed chest pain,
his troponin peaked at 5.10 with very ischemic looking ECG. He
was initially put on integrillin and heparin. However, his renal
function continues to worsen and the integrillin was then
switched to reapro. He subsequently passed large liquid black
stool. The reapro and heparin was thus discontinued. The renal
function continues to worsen and he also developed flash
pulmonary edema with acute respiratory distress. He was then
transferred to the CCU and aggressively diuresed with natrecor
and achieved a net loss of 3.2L. The flash pulmoary edema was
thought to be caused by his evolving MI. His EF was known to be
35%. He was then transferred to the floor. His oxygen saturation
did not improve despite aggressive diuresis with natrecor and
lasix drip. His CXR showed moderate to large bilateral pleural
effusion. Bilateral thoracentesis was performed and he had a
therapeutic tap about 2L on  the right and 1.4 L on the left.
Pleural fluid was consistent with transudative effusion. His
respiratory status improved dramatically since then. His
diuretic regimen was gradually switched to IV and then to oral
medication. He will be discharged on oral lasix 20 [**Hospital1 **]. There is
no plan for cardiac catheterization at this moment. [**Name2 (NI) **] will be
managed medically with aspirin, metoprolol XL, simvastatin and
nitroglycerin.

Patient also has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He
was on digoxin, diltiazem and coumadin as outpatient.
However,coumadin was discontinued because of his GI bleed.
Diltiazem and digoxin were discontinued because of the frequent
4s pauses seen on telemetry. On discharge,he was in sinus rhythm
on metoprolol and amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 **]. Digoxin was not restarted
due to his renal failure. He will have to have a GI workup
before coumadin could be restarted. GI workup will have to be
arranged as outpatient. Meanwhile, he would continue on PPI. He
had recieved a total of 3 units of pack red cells while he was
actively bleeding and since then his hematocrit had been stable.
He was also started on iron pills.  Once his EGD/colonoscopy has
been done, he should be restarted on coumadin for stroke
prevention (Afib) with a goal INR of [**2-25**].

His creatinine peaked at 4.1, likely due to decreased perfusion
from worsening CHF in the setting of MI. Renal U/S showed no
hydronephrosis or stone. There was also no cast in urine to
suggest ATN. The creatinine gradually drifted down with
resolution of his CHF status

He will be discharged to rehabilitation with close follow up.
