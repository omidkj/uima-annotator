History of Present Illness:
35 yo F w/ PMH complicated DM (multiple admissions for DKA, last
admit MICU [**6-16**] w/ DKA and ?sz - no signs/sxs infection, d/ced
with normalized AG to baseline, insulin regimen, and set up to
receive Keppra per pharmacy w/ pre-approval paperwork set and
pharmacy [**Month/Year (2) 653**]. Also recent admit [**6-10**] with DKA, left AMA),
HTN, ESRD on CAPD 5x/day p/w mental status changes, ?low BS. Pt

was found unresponsive on morning of admission by family. In
field, pt was intubated for airway protection, given narcan and
D50, with no improvement of MS changes (rpt BS = 150 after D50
administration). Of note, pt's family reports BS night prior to
presentation = 33. Otherwise, pt in USOH per family except c/o
leg pain night PTA. In ED, she was found to have K+ of 6.3, Cr
10.6, HCO3 18, lactate 1.6, WBC 7.5 w/out bandemia. She had
peaked T-waves on EKG (no change from previous EKGs on
comparison), given 1 amp of bicarb, 1 amp Ca++Gluconate, 10
units insulin w/ 1 amp D50. 1 hour later, BS = 75 - therefore
given another 1amp D50. 2 hours later, rpt BS = 76. On
presentation to [**Name (NI) **], pt also noted to be hypertensive w/ BP
250/130, other VS WNL - Head CT in ED suboptimal but no bleed.
Pt treated w/ propofol for intubation sedation and to decrease
BP. R femoral line was placed. Neurology was consulted and EEG
was ordered. Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on CPAP 5 w/ PS 10, TV
700-800, RR19, FiO2 100%, O2sat 100%.

CXR: [**6-26**]: Cardiac silhouette appears prominent, but may be
accentuated by portable supine technique. Pulmonary vascularity
is normal for technique. The lungs reveal no focal areas of
consolidation. No pneumothorax is evident on this supine
radiograph.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
35 yo F w/ PMH uncontrolled DM, non-compliant, s/p recent
admission to MICU [**6-16**] for DKA and ?sz, admitted to ICU w/
mental status changes, and then transferred to the floor for
further management.
.
1.) MS change: Broad differential on differential.  Vascular
(i.e. hypertensive encephalopathy or stroke given elevated BP on
presentation) effectively r/o due to negative head CT and MRI.
Negative head CT for SAH also supported by negative LP.
Infectious etiology effectively r/o by negative blood cx, urine
cx, peritoneal dialysis fluid cx, LP.  Toxic ingestions r/o by
negative tox screen on presenation.  Left with likely etiology
involving hypoglycemic event given family's history of low blood
sugar on night PTA, low blood sugar with poor response to D50 on
presentation to ED.  Possible that pt experienced sz in response
to low blood sugar (as were evidence of sz including bite marks
on tongue on exam), although no evidence of sz activity was
noted during hospital course w/ EEG demonstrating solely diffuse
slowing c/w toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.  Also possible that
some component of acute on chronic [**Month/Year (2) **] failure participated in
patient's mental status changes and extended recovery, as she
had an elevated potassium and Cr on presentation to ED which
began to normalize with peritoneal dialysis in ICU.  Patient was
managed in ICU supportively, with close q2-4hr FSBS to keep
close monitor of blood glucose, maintained on Keppra anti-sz
medication (dose adjusted to 500mg q 24hr for [**Month/Year (2) **] dosing per
[**Month/Year (2) **] and neuro recs), close neuro checks, continued intubation
with airway protection while continued mental status changes, BP
management with outpatient medications (metoprolol).
.
2. Seizure: Pt with history of poorly defined seizure dz,
thought to be primary vs secondary to hypoglycemia, although
possible that a sz could have contributed to mental status
changes that pt presented w/ (?[**1-4**] hypoglycemia). Head CT, MRI
neg.  EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing c/w toxic/metabolic
encephalopathy.  Pt was maintained on Keppra w/out evidence of
further sz.
.
3. CV: Last [**Month/Day (2) 113**] w/EF 75%, no WMA, moderate AS (1.6 cm2)
w/evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Peaking T in V3,
pseudonormalization in V1, otherwise no new changes. New peaked
T over lateral lead likely [**1-4**] to high K - normalized w/
normalizing K+.  Troponin elevated to 0.28 on admission
(elevated from 0.24 on recent hospitalization d/c that had been
trending downward from peak of 0.46 on [**2204-5-31**]), and trended
down to 0.26 during hospital stay.  Therefore likely a small
troponin leak due to underlying condition that caused her MS
changes.  Pt was maintained on Metoprolol throughout hospital
stay, as well as her statin.  Was not on ASA [**1-4**] allergy.
.
4. Anemia: Stable at HCT 26-30 on presentation.  Fell to 25
during stay and was transfused 1 unit pRBC without complication
and with appropriate bump of Hct.  Continue epo 3x/wk (mon, wed,
fri).
.
5. Hyperkalemia - on presentation, K+ elevated to 6.3,
normalized during hospital stay with PD per [**Month
