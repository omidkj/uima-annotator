Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F MMP including diastolic CHF (EF unknown, records from [**Hospital 2586**] pending), HTN, Anemia, Thrombocytosis/Leukocytosis
(followed by Hematologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital3 2358**]) who
presents from [**Hospital3 **] facility with progressive
shortness of breath x 6 days. Patient/daughter report that pt
was in her USOH (walks with walker at baseline) until 6 days
ago, when she began experiencing slight shortness of breath, no
associated cough, fever, chills, or diaphoresis. Dyspnea
progressed, and when patient woke up this morning, she was noted
to be more tachypneic, short of breath, episode lasted 10
minutes. Felt better sitting up in chair. Per report, ? [**Doctor Last Name **] came
3 hours later and O2 sat was 79%, asymptomatic, and patient was
then brought to hospital. Patient reports recent medication
change 7 days ago, right before onset of symptoms - Avapro was
decreased to 150 qd and Hydralazine increased. Daughter reports
similar episode of shortness of breath in [**2187-4-25**], diagnosed
with CHF exacerbation, did better with fluid removal. No recent
weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. + Ankle
swelling. No PND + orthopnea.

.
Lower Extremity U/S [**2-5**]: No evidence of bilateral lower
extremity DVT.
.
CXR [**2-5**]: The heart remains enlarged, with a calcified aortic
arch. The pulmonary vasculature is indistinct, and there are new
bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with CHF. There is no
evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
.
ECHO [**2-7**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is
normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-26**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. There is a small pericardial effusion.
.
Repeat CXR [**2-9**]: CHF with interstitial pulmonary edema and
pleural effusion appear slightly improved since previous
examination of [**2188-2-6**]; however, this may be also partly
technical

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with multiple medical problems
including CHF (EF70%, diastolic dysfunction), Renal
insufficiency, Thrombocythemia who presented with hypoxia,
tachypnea, and dyspnea. The following issues were addressed
during her hospital stay:
.
# Hypoxia/Dyspnea/Tachypnea
Differential was broad in this patient, and included CHF,
Pneumonia, Pulmonary Embolism. Clinical exam with elevated
jugular venous pressure, bilateral lower extremity edema, and
pronounced crackles on lung examination. CXR was remarkable for
gross fluid overload with cephalization of vessels, consistent
with CHF exacerbation, and patient has had similar episodes
previously. Though D-dimer was 600, further PE work-up was not
pursued as we had a more likely explanation for patient's
symptoms. CXR was without infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia,
and patient was afebrile throughout hospital course.
.
For management of patient's CHF, patient was aggressively
diuresed with IV Bumex (as she had ? allergy to Lasix). Agrylin
was held in acute setting as it could contribute to fluid
overload. Diuresis was limited by patient's renal function. On
HD#2, patient with significant tachypnea and using accessory
muscles of respiration. It was felt that patient would benefit
from BIPAP, and she was transferred to the ICU for closer
monitoring. ABG was within normal limits and was not concerning
for hypoxemia or respiratory alkalosis. Patient did well with
BIPAP in the unit, and diuresis was continued. ECHO showed
diastolic dysfunction with no significant valvular abnormalities
to account for symptoms, and findings were consistent with
earlier ECHO done 1 year earlier at OSH. Upon transfer to the
floor one day later, patient appeared more comfortable, and was
no longer using accessory muscles of respiration. Aggressive
diuresis was continued, and Zaroxolyn was used to potentiate
effects of Bumex. A goal of [**11-25**].5 Liters/day negative was
targetted, with good symptomatic improvement. Patient will
continue to need gentle diuresis, provided that her renal status
will allow. She was discharged home on PO Bumex. Patient also
with wheezing on exam, improved with PRN nebulizer treatments,
which can continue as needed on discharge. Electrolytes and
Creatinine to be monitored at her extended care facility.
.
# HYPERTENSION
Blood pressure medications were adjusted given clinical status.
Avapro was discontinued in setting of acute renal failure. Given
acute CHF, Diltiazem was used in favor of BB. Patient also
started on long-acting nitrate for preload reduction, and
hydralazine was used intermittently for blood pressure control,
but discontinued on discharge as patient's heart failure is
mostly diastolic (and most data supports use of hydralazine in
systolic HF patients). Patient with baseline HR in 50s, and
marked wheezing with BB use in past, so Diltiazem XR to be used
for outpatient BP
