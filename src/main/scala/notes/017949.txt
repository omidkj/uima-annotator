Started feeling weak last night and then today felt as though he
could not walk.  Denies falls. In addition, has had 1 week of
sporadic diffuse abdominal pain that comes and goes, is worse
when he is lying down, and he cannot identify triggers. It has
not been worsening over the week. Also endorses slight back
pain.  Has had very frequent, but formed stools in spite of not
having recently taken Lactulose (d/c'd by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] per pt's
report because he could not tolerate the frequency of the BM's).

called an ambulance today when the weakness and inability to

hepatic encephalopathy, EtOH intoxication, and GIB.  He had an
EGD, which was unremarkable for an active bleeding source, but
he was found to have portal gastropathy, no varices (though has
been noted to have varices on prior EGD reports).  The patient's
Hct remained stable during that admission, and he did not have
any blood transfusions. He also had a RUQ U/S and CT abdomen to
assess for portal vein thrombosis, but these were also negative.
Denies prior episodes of SBP. Said the last time he was tapped
was [**2187**] when he was diagnosed with ascites.  Dry weight is
175lbs, has gained 10lbs over the past week.  Has not eaten
today, but was able to eat yesterday without N/V.  Last EtOH
drink was prior to last admission (over 1 month ago). Has been
taking all medications as directed.
