Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76 yo female w/hx of ovarian CA dx in [**2150**] s/p TAH BSO,
debulkining last in [**7-21**] resulting in colostomy and 9 rounds of
chemo on gemcitibine prior to admission, HTN, CHF (EF now 35%
but nl EF and clean c's in [**7-21**] cath), anxiety, PUD, ureteral
obstruction s/p stents last on left in [**11-21**] who was admitted to
the MICU after severe pulmonary edema after blood transfusion in
Heme/[**Hospital **] clinic. Pt was on regimen of gemcitibine for ovarian CA
after poor tolerance for doxorubacin and routine labs in clinic
revealed Hct 24 so she was she was transfused 2 units PRBC's.
She then developed respiratory distress requiring intubation in
the ED. She was found to have a small troponin leak to .10 and
cardiology was consulted, but attributed it to CHF and
recommended no need for cath or heparin. TTE revealed apical and
septal HK with an EF of 35% with most recent TTE


Social History:
Lives on her own. Is Greek speaking. Two sons live close by and
are involved -- [**Doctor Last Name **] and [**Doctor Last Name **]. She does not use tob, etoh, or
drugs.

Abdominal MRI [**2-15**]:
1) Extensive tumor mass within the lower pelvis, growing
superiorly,
resulting in bilateral distal ureteral obstruction. Progression
vs. prior.
2) Large suprapubic enhancing tumor mass as described,
corresponding to the calcified mass detected on recent CT.
3) Incidentally detected deep venous thrombosis within the left
leg.
*
ECHO [**2-12**]:
EF 35%, mild symmetric LVH, mild global HK and severe HK of
septum and apex c/w CAD.
*
cath [**7-21**]: nl coronaries, diastolic dysfunction
*
renal u/s: IMPRESSION: Bilateral nephroureteral stents. Mild
pelviectasis on the right,and more prominent pelvocaliectasis on
the left, with additional multiple parapelvic cysts bilaterally.
In comparison to the CT dated [**2172-12-24**], the most recent
comparison examination available, the degree of bilateral
pelvocaliectasis is probably stable to perhaps slightly
decreased.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. SOB. The patient was treated with oxygen, lasix, nitro,
morphine in the ED with little result. She intubated in the
emergency department because of worsening respiratory status and
transferred to the ICU. CXR at the time showed patchy bilateral
infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. In the ICU, the
patient was successfully diuresed and repeat CXR was greatly
improved and she was successfully extubated on HOD#2. On arrival
to the floor, the patient was breathing comfortably on 4 L
supplemental O2 which was successfully weaned on the day prior
to admission.

2. CHF. The patient was found to be in CHF at presentation.
After initial diuresis, the patient was thought to be euvolemic
and diuresis was stopped prior to transfer to the floor. The
patient had a slight troponin elevation to 0.10 but ruled out
for acute coronary syndrome by CK and MB fraction.
Echocardiogram revealed an EF of 35% with global and focal
hypokinesis suggesting an acute coronary event may have occurred
sometime in the interim between her normal cath in [**2170**] and this
hospitalization. Chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not
thought to have been responsible for the CHF. The etiology of
the patient's CHF is presumed to be volume overload from the
transfusion. In house, the patient was treated with metoprolol,
aspirin, nitrates/hydralzine. It was not felt that the patient
would benefit from having a stress test or cath during this
hospitalization. The patient will follow-up with cardiology in
[**1-21**] weeks to repeat echo and determine outpatient plan. It is
recommended that the patient begin an ACE inhibitor when renal
function returns to baseline.

3. ARF/Ureteral obstruction. The patient was found to be in
acute renal failure in the ICU with creatinine to 4.6 (BUN 76).
Initially this was thought to be ischemia-induced ATN secondary
to the flash pulmonary edema, but given the patient's history of
ureteral obstruction, this was investigated by renal U/S. U/S
was inconclusive and a follow-up abdominal MRI revealed
bilateral distal ureteral obstruction on HOD #4. In the interim,
creatinines had already begun to trend down, consistent with
ATN. On HOD#5, the patient had bilateral ureteral stent
replacement and the creatinine subsequently continued to
normalize to a level of 1.5 on day of discharge. The patient
will follow-up with urology for outpatient management and likely
restenting in a few months.

4. Anticoagulation/Anemia. A left femoral vein DVT was found on
MRI on HOD #4. At this time, the patient was begun on heparin
for anticoagulation. Given the patient's history of GI bleed on
coumadin, the decision was made not to initiate coumadin for
outpatient anticoagulation. Instead, an IVC filter was placed
with the assumption that the long-term complications of clot may
not be as significant in this patient with a somewhat limited
life expectancy.
