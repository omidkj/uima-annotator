Chief Complaint:
Fall, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old female with had a mechanical fall. She was
walking with a walker at rehab and was hit by a swinging door in
the back and fell and hit her head on the doorknobb in the
process. She lost consciousness when she hit her head, not
prior. The fall was witnessed, she did have bladder incontinence
but no seizure like movements. She regained consciousness when
the She became short of breath when she was laid flat to have
the C- collar placed. She was taken to an outside hospital.
There she was found to have a head bleed and was thought to be
in pulmonary edema. She was given lasix (responded with a liter
of urine), duonebs and nitropaste. She was initially hypoxic to
the 60s but after the lasix her O2 sat improved. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further managment.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97 106 182/98 18 99 NRB. Initially
on a NRB but was weaned down to NC. Patient was given zofran,
morphine IV, initially nitro gtt then changed to nitroprusside
gtt. She was given keppra per neurosurg. A CT Head was done
which confirmed the bleed. CT Neck was done which showed
degenerative spine disease and C-collar was cleared. Hip and
shoulder XR were read as normal. Vitals on transfer were 90,
152/86, 16, 100% 3L
.
On the floor, she was complaining of a headache and right
shoulder pain.

[**2179-6-12**] CT C-spine:

noted. If
ligamentous injury is a clinical concern, then an MR is
recommended for
further evaluation.

Findings mild pulmonary edema with possible superimposed
pneumonia. Aspiration cannot be excluded. Suggest follow-up to
resolution.

[**2179-6-14**] CT Chest:
1. Right basal consolidation/atelectasis. Differential diagnosis
would
include aspiration. No clear evidence of neoplasm is
demonstrated.
2. Extensive vascular calcification as described in the body of

correlate with
dedicated imaging.
4. Bilateral right slightly more than left pleural effusion that
appears to be low in density, nonhemorrhagic.
.

CT-Head [**2179-6-16**]: FINDINGS: A 28 x 16 mm epidural hematoma is
redemonstrated overlying the right parietal lobe near the vertex
(2:23). This is stable in size since the [**2179-6-13**] study and
decreased compared to [**2179-5-13**]. No new hemorrhage, edema, or
mass effect is seen. The ventricles and sulci are unchanged in
size and configuration. Relative hypodensity of the
periventricular white matter is compatible with chronic
microvascular ischemic disease.

There has been interval improvement of the right-sided subgaleal
hematoma with some decrease.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable right parietal epidural hematoma since the [**2179-6-13**] study and decreased compared to [**2179-5-13**].
2. Decreased right subgaleal hematoma.
3. No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

ECG [**2179-6-16**]: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation like due to left
anterior fascicular block. Right bundle-branch block. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2179-6-13**] lateral T wave changes are
not as apparent on the current tracing. The Q-T interval is
slightly shorter. Clinical correlation is suggested.
[**2179-6-17**]: Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior
fascicular block. Compared to tracing #1 lateral ST-T wave
changes are not seen on the current tracing.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 71 year old female with multiple medical problems who
fell and hit her head and also became short of breath.
.
# Shortness of Breath: Patient's shortness of breath was related
to CHF.  She improved dramatically from the lasix given in the
ED.  Her CXR had what was likely a resolving pneumonia.  She was
afebrile and without cough so was not treated with antibiotics.
She was treated symptomatically with lasix 40 mg IVx1.  Her
respiratory status improved and O2 sats were 90s on room on air
on discharge from the ICU.  She had Chest CT for evaluation of
possible lung malignancy.  This was not done with contrast due
to her chronic kidney disease.  Her CT did not show evidence of
malignancy.  While on the floors she remained asymptomatic and
her oxygen saturations were normal on room air.
.
# Intracranial hemorrhage: Patient with both epidural and
sub-galeal bleed on head CT. Neurosurgery evaluated the patient
in the ED and opted for a non-operative course.  Her neuro exam
remained unchanged and serial CT scans did not show expansion of
the hematoma.  She was started on keppra for seizure
prophylaxis.  She needs neurosurgical follow-up on discharge
with a repeat non-constrast Head CT.  She should continue to
Keppra until her follow-up.
.
# Hypertension: Home hypertensive medications initially held and
patient was on a nitroprusside drip in the ICU to maintain SBP <
140 for head bleed.  She was started on Carvedilol 25mg PO BID
(her home dose) and Nifedipine ER 60mg PO daily (changed from
her home Amlodipine).  Her blood pressures were elevated one
night on the floor to the 200s/100s.  She was given hydralazine
and a nitro patch which brought her under control.  Her
nifedipine was increased to nifedipine SR 90 mg and she was
watched on this dose for 24 hours.  Her pressures remained under
160 with this new regimen. Per neurosurgery, her goal SBP is
less than 160. We are discharging the patient on lisinopril 5 mg
by mouth daily as she does have comorbities that warrant ACE-I
use.  We recommend that she takes this medicine at night as her
blood pressure trend showed higher pressures at night.
.
# DM: Home insulin regimen continued.
.
# CKD:  The patient's creatinine trended down to 1.2 on the day
of discharge.  It seems her kidney function has returned to
[**Location 213**].
.
# L Rotator Cuff Tear: OSH MRI was obtained from [**Hospital1 87076**] sho
