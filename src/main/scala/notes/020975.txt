History of Present Illness:
70 y/o M with diffuse large B cell lymphoma admitted for BRBPR.
Patient was recently discharged from OMED service on [**11-9**] after
receiving R-ICE chemotherapy.  Tolerated well, received neulasta
[**2114-11-9**] and was doing well at home. Over the weekend he
experienced some lower leg aches and took 2 regular strength
aspirin on saturday. He had a bowel movment on Saturday. On
Sunday he felt fine but had no bowel movement. This morning at
5am pt awoke and felt the urge to defecate, which was unusual as
he never feels this in the mornings, and he passed a large
volume of what he thought was diarrhea but saw dark red blood in
the toilet. Called his primary oncologist who advised him to go
to the ED. In the ED he had another large volume bloody diarrhea
around noon. Pt states he has never had red blood per rectum
before. Of note, pt had a colonoscopy on [**10-30**] that showed
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and ascending colon, a polyp
at 80cm in the colon (single piece polypectomy with cold snare),
and friability and congestion in the sigmoid colon. Pt does also
have a history of hepatitis C, untreated (per pt preference) and
history of Hep B core antibody + in [**2111**].
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt felt well, had no complaints. Denied
dizziness/lightheadedness, denied n/v/abdominal pain. Pt was
normotensive but given 500 cc 1/2 NS and 2u pRBC were put on
hold but not transfused. Pt was admitted for GI bleed. Labs
showed stable H/H at 11.3/ 33.2 (11.9/34.6 on DC friday). PLT
145 (170 on DC), and WBC of 17.3.
.
HPI from admission to Internal [**Name (NI) **] (pt was transferred to
[**2-9**] service this admission, IM was the last one)
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79M with h/o DLBCL s/p RICE chemotherapy,
adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy,Hepatitis C, prostate cancer,
and diabetes who presented on [**11-12**] with BRBPR and is now s/p
sigmoidectomy and end colostomy for necrotic sigmoid colon
lesions.  Pt had a colonoscopy on [**10-30**] for thickening of his
sigmoid colon seen on CT scan. Sigmoid not well visualized, but
biopsies showed ulceration consistent with radiation proctitis.
He also had a polypectomy at that time. Then admitted [**11-5**] to
[**11-9**] after recurrence of his DLBCL was seen on R buttock biopsy.
He received chemotherapy and got R-ICE therapy. His Lasix was
continued but [**Month/Day (2) **] held due to concern for thrombocytopenia from
chemotherapy. He was then readmitted [**11-12**] for painless
hematochezia episodes. His Hct and hemodynamics were stable, and
he had elevated WBC's after being given Neulasta recently. Had
sigmoidoscopy [**11-13**] which was unrevealing due to poor prep.
Repeat colonoscopy was done [**11-15**] and was concerning for necrosis
of mid-sigmoid and proximal sigmoid. He went to the OR on [**11-15**]
where he had ex-lap, sigmoid colectomy, and end colostomy. He
was doing well post-operatively. Rheumatology was consulted on
[**11-20**] for R knee pain and swelling and fever to 102 and tapped
his knee which showed monosodium urate crystals consistent with
his h/o gout; Gstain and culture were negative.
.
On [**11-21**] he got acutely SOB, was diaphoretic, and was put on
non-rebreather and transferred to MICU. He was felt to be in
flash pulmonary edema, confirmed by CXR, and was already
diuresing by the time he got to MICU. EKG was concerning for
septal elevations, with TWI in II-III, and cardiac enzymes were
seen to be elevated with an elevated BNP as well. ICU consulted
Cardiology. Echo showed EF 35-40%, TR gradient 33, near akinesis
of the septum, 1+MR, [**12-10**]+TR, RV normal.
.
The evening of [**11-23**], had episode of fever, tachypnea,
tachycardia, increased work or breathing. Trop 0.24->0.34. Has
cardiomyopathy was at baseline. Cardiology was consulted and
felt this was related to demand ischemia, but felt further
work-up indicated.
.
Pt was taken to cath on [**11-23**] where he was found to have new 3vd
including 60-70% LMCA dz, LVEDP 7, given 300 cc's. No
interventions were done, recommended medical therapy given
comorbidities. CXR now shows substantial improvement in the
previously moderately-severe pulmonary edema. He was started on
statin.


Past Medical History:
Pt has low grade grade [**1-11**] follicular center lymphoma, diagnosed
[**2099**] with transformation into large cell lymphoma in subcut
nodules in [**2102**]. Rx'd 6 cycles CHOP with CR. Developed
subsequent cardiomyopathy.  4-6 weeks ago pt p/w new pain in his
right buttock with radiation down his right leg. It was felt to
be degenerative arthritis, pt given tramadol. Pain has continued
and more recently he developed left lower quadrant pain and
tenderness that was felt possibly to be due to diverticulitis.
Given cipro with some improvement in his abdominal pain. CT abd
showed thickening of the distal descending colon as well as a
small splenic mass and a large 6 cm mass in his buttock as well
as new spiculated nodules at the base of his lungs. He had a
needle biopsy of his buttock mass done by IR at [**Hospital1 **] which showed
recurrence of his large cell lymphoma from [**2102**]. Pt denies wt
loss, fever/chills, n/v. He underwent a colonoscopy earlier in
[**Month (only) **] that showed some very mild thickening of his colon that
did not look malignant, biopsies consistent with radiation
induced colitis. Pt was admitted [**11-5**] for R-ICE therapy which
he tolerated well (infusion reaction to rituxan resolved with
slower rate of infusion and solumedrol) and was discharged
[**2114-11-9**] and recieved neulasta that day in clinic.
