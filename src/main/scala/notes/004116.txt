Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Tetanus Toxoid / Bee Pollens

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85M with complete heart block s/p pacer, HTN, diastolic CHF,
IDDM, gout, COPD, PVD s/p LLE stents several weeks ago
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] ED from NH for hypoxia.
.
Today at his nursing home, he was found around 1:30pm to be more
lethargic, short of breath with BP 70/50 and difficult to assess
radial pulses.  O2sat 86% on RA. Pt was BIBA to [**Hospital3 **]
ED, VS at EMS evaluation was P 50, BP 70/P, RR 20, unable to get
a pulse ox, FSBS 114.  In the [**Name (NI) 46**] [**Name (NI) **], pt was alert but noted
to be cyanotic and pallid with mottled skin.  Pt c/o diffuse
abdominal pain. VS were not recorded.  Labs notable for WBC 21.1
(88.3N, no bands), CPK 48 but trop I 0.6 (ref 0-0.04) - ?0.47
when confirmed; pt remained CP free and EKG showed a paced
rhythm at 80 bpm.  CXR was read as unremarkable with pacing
leads in place. Noncontrast CT chest showed "small patchy
interstitial infiltrates with focal bronchiectasis and
nodularity in the posterior left lung base" and emphysematous
changes.  Noncontrast CT abdomen was unremarkable other than for
mild diverticulosis. Pt was given vanco/zosyn and 3L IV fluid
without improvement in his Started on peripheral levophed for
SBP 70/palpable and given hydrocortisone 100mg IV.  He was
transferred to our ED for further management.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T97.8 P80 SBP135 R18 100% on NRB.
Transferred on 13 mcg of peripheral levophed but pt was given
another 1L NS, and pressures remained stable after levophed
weaned off. CXR with increased infiltrate in LLL. WBC 17, Hct
25, guaiac negative. Lactate 2.1. EKG paced at 80. Pt given
combivent neb. Only complaint was foot pain. Has 2 PIV in. On
transfer, HR80, 100/61, 20, 96% on NRB  CXR.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt without any complaints other than L
toe pain.  Earlier abdominal pain had resolved at some point in
the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; not c/w GERD.  He does recall feeling more
dyspneic on exertion for several days.  No CP, shoulder/jaw
pain, palpitations, N/V, LH.  Per son, pt was recently admitted
to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**5-3**] for dyspnea and L toe pain.  Per his
son, there was concern for DVT and PE, but LENIs and d-dimer
were negative.  He was treated with nitro, lasix, ASA, plavix,
lovenox, and bronchodilators initially and sx improved while in
the ED.  Cardiology c/s attributde mildly elevated troponins
attributed to demand. Per his son, he underwent a nuclear stress
test that was unremarkable and was discharged. He was started on
prednisone for presumed gout with no improvement in his sx
since.

CXR (Portable) [**2120-5-14**]:
HISTORY: This is an 85-year-old male with elevated white blood
cell count,
hypotension and wheeze. Evaluate for acute process.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2114-7-3**].

SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is no change in
the
cardiomediastinal contour, with mild cardiomegaly, but no
evidence for CHF. A
left chest pacing device is in unchanged position in comparison
to [**2114**].
There is left lung base atelectasis, but developing infection
cannot be
completely excluded. The bony thorax appears unremarkable.


IMPRESSION: Left lung base atelectasis, but developing pneumonia
cannot be
excluded. PA and lateral may be helpful for further evaluation
if clinically
feasible.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Shock:
Patient with hypotension requiring pressors at OSH ED with a
lactate 2.1.  At [**Hospital1 18**] patient was responsive to IVF and weaned
off levophed.   Most likely septic given mild hypothermia, WBC
17.3 and neutrophilia, hypoxia, and CT chest finding c/w
pneumonia.  While it is possible that the leukocytosis may be
secondary to prednisone, the prednisone may also be masking a
fever.  Treated empirically with vanc, zosyn with rapid
improvment. There may have also been a component of hypovolemia
in setting of decreased oral intake at [**Hospital1 1501**] given response to
IVF.  Pt has only been on short taper of prednisone so less
likely adrenal insufficiency although did receive hydrocortisone
at OSH.  Pt with elevated troponin but less likely cardiogenic
shock - may more likely represent end organ damage from
hypoperfusion; no evidence of CHF and BP unlikely to reverse so
quickly.  He was never again hypotensive on the floor and his
white count resolved with IV Abx.  We were never 100% convinced
that this was from pneumonia and a foot CT was checked prior to
discharge to r/o osteomyelitis which showed no evidence of
osteomyelitis. All cultures were negative.
