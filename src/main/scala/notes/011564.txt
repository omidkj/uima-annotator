Chief Complaint:
acute SOB at rehab, arrested, intubated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
flex bronch


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 69yo Cambodian woman with history of metastatic papillary
thyroid cancer s/p subtotal thyroidectomy and tracheostomy,
presenting from OSH after respiratory and cardiac arrest. Her
history dates back to [**2173-4-9**] when she presented unresponsive
requiring intubation. She had been diagnosed with papillary
thyroid cancer in [**3-/2173**] and underwent subtotal thyroidectomy on
[**2173-4-12**]. She subsequently developed upper airway compromise due
to subglottal edema. She underwent tracheostomy [**2173-4-16**] and PEG
placement [**2173-5-3**]. She was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (3) 65848**]. Hospital course was complicated by acinetobacter
and enterobacter pneumonias, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus,
sepsis, sinusitis, and atrial flutter. She was eventually
discharged to rehab. She continued to have problems with
tracheal stenosis, and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2173-8-20**]. She
underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy revealing
tracheomalacia, subglottic stenosis, and infra and superior
glottic swelling. She had a swallow study which showed
aspiration. She was transferred to rehab not on ventilator.

At rehab on [**2173-9-2**] pseudomonas, stenotrophomonas, MRSA, and
enterococcus were cultured from the trach site, and she was
treated with levofloxacin and linezolid. Today she was noted to
be having difficulty breathing through the trach and was brought
to [**Hospital6 5016**] ED. She was intubated with 6ETT through
trach stoma. She arrested requiring CPR, epinephrine, and
atropine, and was revived. Thick secretions were suctioned. A
6.0trach tube was reinserted by anesthesia at the OSH prior to
transfer. On presentation now she is alert. She responds "no" to
question of speaking English.


Past Medical History:

nodes

thyroidectomy on [**2173-4-12**].

PSH: thyroidectomy w/ sternotomy, trach, PEG [**4-12**]


Social History:
Social: The pt has six children living in the area, 2 children
living in [**Country 5737**].  She is from [**Country **] and speaks Catnonese.
She understands some English.  Apparently she was independent
with mobility and basic ADL prior to her last hospitalization.
Her functional capacity recently has been the need for maximal
assistance to total dependency in most areas

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW EXAMINATION: An oral and pharyngeal
swallowing video fluoroscopy was performed today in
collaboration with the speech and language pathology division.
Various consistencies of barium including thin liquid, nectar
thickened liquid, puree, and a half cookie coated with barium
were administered.

FINDINGS: The oral phase was unremarkable for pathology. Mild
valleculae residue was noted, cleared with frequent swallowing.
Mild spillover was noted before each swallow. With thin liquids,
mild aspiration was noted without cough reflex initiated. _____
laryngeal excursion was normal. Palatal elevation and, laryngeal
valve closure, and epiglottic deflection were within functional
limits.

IMPRESSION: Before swallowing patient develops mild spillover
into the valleculae cleared with frequent swallows. No
aspiration noted with thick liquids but mild aspiration upon
thin liquids without initiating cough reflex.

Echo: GENERAL COMMENTS: Frequent ventricular premature beats.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-4-13**], the
LVEF is no
longer hyperdynamic, but remains normal. Otherwise, no change.

CXR:
INDICATION: Tracheostomy and shortness of breath.
A tracheostomy tube remains in place. There is narrowing of the
airway proximal to the level of the tube without change. Heart
size is normal. The aorta is tortuous. The lungs are clear, and
there are no pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:
Airway narrowing proximal to tracheostomy entry site without
change.
No evidence of pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to MICU intubated after resp arrest at Rehab
facility. Thought to be r/t plugging from granulation tissue.
Flex bronch showed patent T-tube w/o granulation tissue above or
below the T-tube. Etiology of resp arrest then thought to be
from secretion plugging. Rec'd supporttive pulmonary/cardiac
care in MICU w/ good recovery. Intubation via stoma w/ ETT was
converted back to trach as prior to event.
On HD #3 pt transferred from ICU to floor for ongoing pul rahab.
Noted to be having runs of non-sustained, asymptomatic bigeminy
and trigeminy. Cardiology was consulted and echo was performed
(see report section )w/o etiology of ectopy; thought to be
related to CPR given during arrest. Currently on betablocker and
can be titrated up for HR control if BP allows.
Treated w/ linezolid and levoflox for MRSA PNA which will stop
on [**2173-9-27**]. Rec'ing bactrim for UTI until [**2173-9-28**]. On steriod
taper for edmea noted on bronch.
glucoses controlled w/ [**Hospital1 **] NPH and SSRI.
Kept NPO w/ tube feeds via J-tube until able to perform video
swallow study.
Swallow study done on HD#7 and pt passed for ground diet and
nectar thick liquids; no thin liquids.
capping trial initiated on HD#7-[**Last Name (un) 1815**] capping x 4 hrs but became
anxious. Sats were mid-high 90's however, pt was uncapped d/t
anxiety. Remained uncapped over noc w/ hunidified oxygen.
