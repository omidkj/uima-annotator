Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
consulted for Subdural hematomas

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
87M with a history of Parkinson's disease and atrial
fibrilliation on coumadin, who presented to OSH after he was
found down in his yard by a neighbor.  The patient was able to
describe that he was getting his mail and tripped and fell,
hitting his head but no loss of concsciousness, although he does
not recall exactly what happened.  Per EMS, he had
perserveration, but denied headache, neck pain, extremity pain
or
parasthesias.  He was A+Ox 3 at OSH and upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
this afternoon.  CT scan at OSH demonstrated bilateral subdural
hematomas, L frontal hematoma 13mm and R frontal hematoma 4mm,
with subarachnoid hemorrage extending into parietal convexities,
without midline shift. INR 1.9. Received 2u FFP and Vit k prior
to transfer.
Of note, patient was offered surgery for his valvular disease a
few months ago, but decided against it and made himself DNR
status.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST RADIOGRAPH [**2154-8-15**]

INDICATION: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: [**2154-8-13**].

FINDINGS: There is no relevant change. Moderate cardiomegaly,
mild
distension of the pulmonary vasculature. No evidence of pleural
effusion, no focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of
pneumonia.

Head CT [**2154-8-14**]:
FINDINGS: There is no significant change in multi-compartmental
blood 13 hours after the most recent scan. There is slightly
more intraventricular blood, but no evidence of obstruction. No
new hemorrhage is seen. No evidence of herniation or other short
interval change is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in multi-compartmental blood 13 hours
after the most recent scan.
2. Slight increase in intraventricular blood, but no evidence of
obstructive hydrocephalus.

Head CT [**2154-8-13**]: Final Report
INDICATION: Fall and subdural hematoma, transferred from outside
hospital.

COMPARISON: Outside hospital study obtained at approximately 10
a.m. on
[**2154-8-13**] Hospital.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT with additional bone algorithm
reconstructions.

FINDINGS: There is marked interval worsening of bifrontal
subdural,
subarachnoid, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage. A large focus of
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left inferior frontal lobe
measuring 2.3 x 3 cm was not noted on the prior study. There is
also increased hemorrhagic component layering along the
interhemispheric fissure and falx cerebri.
Multiple bilateral foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage involving
left inferior
temporal, bilateral frontal, posterior frontoparietal are noted.
There is
mild perihemorrhagic edema most prominently noted in the left
inferior frontal lobes without significant mass effect or shift
of normally midline structures.
There is no intraventricular hemorrhage, entrapment or
hydrocephalus.
Bilateral basal ganglia and insular cortex demonstrates old
lacunar infarct.
The basilar cisterns are preserved without evidence of downward
transtentorial herniation. There is posterior soft tissue
thickening with scalp hematoma noted superiorly. Air-fluid
levels and mucosal thickening is noted in the left sphenoid and
right maxillary antrum. There is also mucosal thickening in
bilateral anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells, left
maxillary sinus and middle sphenoid sinus. Small amount of air
is noted in the cavernous sinus which could be iatrogenic.
Additionally, there is also minimal opacification of bilateral
mastoid air cells. Impacted right upper molar is noted in the
right maxillary antrum.

Osseous structures demonstrate nondisplaced midline frontal bone
fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild interval worsening of bifrontal subdural, subarachnoid
and
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Additional foci of subarachnoid
hemorrhage are also noted bilaterally involving the
frontoparietal and inferior temporal regions. There is no
intraventricular hemorrhage on the current study.
2. Small amount of air in the cavernous sinus could be
iatrogenic.
3. Nondisplaced midline frontal bone fracture.
4. Mucosal thickening in multiple paranasal sinuses, and
bilateral mastoid
air cell opacification as described above.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**8-13**] to the ICU. He received FFP and
factor IX to reverse his INR as well as vitamin K. He was put on
mannitol to decrease swelling in the brain. He was also put on
dilantin. The patient was DNR/DNI when he arrived to the
hospital. Cardiology was consulted who agreed with giving him
additional lasix due to his CHF history after receiving FFP. On
[**8-14**] there was a family meeting and they decided to all him to
be intubated if necessary for short-term. The patient's exam
remained stable. He received FFP again on [**8-15**] and [**8-16**] for
elevated INR. On [**8-16**] he was transferred to the stepdown unit.
Over the weekend the patient's neuro exam became worse. The
family decided to make him DNR/DNI again and to make him comfort
measures only. Geriatrics was also consulted to help with his
management. He was unresponsive on [**8-19**] in the morning but his
pupils were reactive. He did have a grasp bilaterally and
withdrew with the lower extremities. Palliative care was
consulted and they recommended adding a morphine bolus in
addition to the morphine drip. During the afternoon of [**8-19**] the
patient's respirations were increasing and he received a
morphine bolus. He expired at 3:45 on [**8-19**] and both his sons
were notified shortly afterwards.
