Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
epigastric/chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with stent placement, no sphincterotomy seconary to
supratheraputic INR

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 87yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**2141**], mult PCI since,
ischemic CMY with LVEF 35%, Afib on coumadin, possible AS and/or
MR, diet controlled DM2, ?CRI, gout, who presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital at 4am on [**2156-8-1**] with pain in his epigastrium and
chest, and was transferred here out of concern for cholangitis.
The patient reports intermittent discomfort in his chest and
epigastrium which began 1-2 weeks ago, with no precipitating
factors such as exertion or food. He describes it as a cramping
pain, with radiation to his R shoulder, but not to his back or
arms. He did say that it felt worse at night while lying down.
The pain felt different than his prior angina, and he treated it
with Tylenol with some relief. However, on the night PTA, the
pain recurred and he was unable to get back to sleep. His wife
called EMS, and he was [**Name (NI) 4045**] to [**Hospital **] Hospital. ROS is notable
for: chronic DOE, prehaps with some increase over baseline;
increase in his RLE swelling (has chronic L>R edema from prior
surgeries; denies F/C/V, diarrhea, constipation, changes in
stool or urine color or frequency. He does have some erythema
and swelling of his left 5th digit, which started 3 weeks ago,
and which he thinks may have been from a bug bite.

At [**Hospital **] Hospital, he was found to have EKG without change and
normal cardiac enzymes. CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions,
L>R. He was felt to be in CHF on exam, given Lasix for diuresis.
His labs came back with WBC 12.4 with 88% PMNs, 8% bands, and
abnl LFTs (AST 122, ALT 54, AP 307, TBili 3.3, DBili 2.5, TProt
7.3, Alb 3.5). His lipase was elevated at 2214, and his BUN and
Cr were elevated at 36/1.4, unclear if chronic or acute. An abd
u/s revealed several small gallstones in the gallbladder,
without thickening of his GB walls, and with no biliary
dilatation. He received Levaquin + CTX, vomited once and
received Zofran. His INR was 2.8, and he was given 5mg Vit K sq
once (no FFP). After discussion with the ERCP fellow at [**Hospital1 18**],
the patient was transferred here for further care and plan for
ERCP.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old male admitted [**2156-8-4**] as a trasfer
from [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4046**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for sepsis/pancreatitis.

1. pancreatitis/E.coli septicemia -- ERCP revealed obstructive
gallstone, and a stent was placed.  Outside blood cultures
positive for pan sensitive E. coli.  He received antibiotics,
including initially rocephin at outside hospital, ampicillin on
transfer, then ciprofloxacin since [**8-5**], with a stop date
planned for [**2156-8-16**].  A follow up appointment as an outpatient
for repeat ERCP and stent removal should be planned for [**4-12**]
weeks post discharge (initial ERCP date [**2156-8-4**]).  He improved
dramatically after ERCP, with no abdominal pain and tolerating a
full diet on discharge.

2. acute renal failure -- improved to baseline with Lasix and
supportive care of sepsis.  ACE inhibitor and digoxin held.

3. CAD/ischemic cardiomyopathy -- some question of ACS on
admission, however no ECG changes and symptoms consistent with
pancreatitis.  His antiplatelet medications were held due to
interventions, and should be held 10 days post ERCP.  His beta
blocker was restarted when he improved from his inital
presentation.  A statin was added during his hospitalization as
well, and should be followed up with liver enzymes and lipid
profile in 5 weeks after discharge.  His home dose Lasix was
restarted as well, three days prior to discharge.

4. atrial fibrillation/coumadin -- Mr. [**Known lastname **] received FFP on
presentation in order to perform ERCP.  After the procedure, it
was restarted at his home dose of 4 mg po qhs.  However, his INR
was affected by the simulateous administration of ciprofloxacin,
and was supratheraputic to 3.6 on [**2155-8-12**].  It was held the night
prior to discharge, with instructions for the rehab facility to
follow INR closely, and adjust coumadin appropriately.  He was
rate controlled appropriately throughout his hospitalization,
although his digoxin was held secondary to renal insufficiency.
It can be restarted at the discretion of his primary physician.

5. hypertension -- mildly elevated blood pressures in the latter
part of his hospitalization, controlled with Lasix and
metoprolol.  ACE inhibitor held initially because of renal
insufficiency.  Restarted day prior to discharge.  He should
have Crt/potassium checked one week after restarting ace
(instructions given to rehab facility).
