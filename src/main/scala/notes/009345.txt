Lumbar spinal stenosis

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 1743**] [**Known lastname **] is a 77-year-old female who
presented with a debilitating syndrome of progressive back
and radiating leg pain as well as weakness, provoked by
standing and walking.  Over time, she progressively lost
ability to walk as a result of this syndrome. She was found
to have severe spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication.
Her syndrome was refractory to prolonged and multimodal
course of conservative care.  Due to the severity of
symptoms, in concert with the refractory nature of the
syndrome despite conservative care, she did elect to undergo
surgical treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt underwent the above mentioned procedure.  She tolerated this
well and was transferred to the ICU post-operatively given
significant blood loss as well as for her significant pulmonary
history.  ICU noted development of hospital-acquired pneumonia
and treated appropriately with IV antibiotics.  She otherwise
progressed well in the unit.

She responded well to treatment, and was transferred to the
floor from the ICU.  Vanco/Zosyn were utilized to cover the
pneumonia.  Pain was adequately controlled with IV followed by
PO meds.  Drain was discontinued when output was minimal,
incision maintained excellent appearance throughout
hospitalization.  PT worked with the patient.  She had
difficulty progressing secondary to multiple medical
comorbidities and low reserve.

Once patient was stable from the standpoint of her pain control,
and with good control of her comorbidities, she was deemed
stable for transfer to rehab.
