History of Present Illness:
62 YO female with Hx of Developmental delay, Bipolar D/O,
epilepsy, admitted to the ICU after being found unresponsive and
in respiratory failure on the floor.  Per pt's sister and
previous notes , [**Name (NI) **] was in her USOH, but has slowly become
more agitated since this change, but has been functioning at
home and shopping/balancing her checkbook w/o difficulty.

Approximately 3 weeks ago her Lithium was changed to Lithobid by
CVS b/c of a med shortage. For approximately 1-2 weeks [**Known firstname **]
has been increasingly agitated, with some tremors and has been
dropping things. She may have had some right arm stiffness as
well. She has some also been quite sleepy recently, and has been
unable to go to her day care program. Her breathing has also
been labored recently, and was placed on Singular for allergies.
She has also had ~1 week of coughing and hoarseness.

In the ED, the pt received a wrist/foremarm/chest X-ray, head
CT, neck CT, and chest CTA to r/o PE. She was placed back on
Lithium and Seroqel, and given Ativan as well as 7.5mg of Haldol
for agitation.
She was started on Levaquin/flagyl for possible PNA yesterday
and was evaluated by psych for MS changes and an EEG report is
pending.  Pt was at baseline [**Name8 (MD) **] RN until found patient
unresponsive at 0400.  ABG was done 7.08/115/131 and pt was
emergently intubated with no medications for respiratory failure
and brought to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Pt was borderline hypotensive MAP 50-60 so
started on phenylepherine.

Social History:
Patient lives in [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) **], and has visiting
services and family members help out as well. She is able to do
her ADL's as well as balancing her chechbook, etc. She attends a
day care program. No history of tobacco abuse.


Physical Exam:
T=98.0, BP=78/55, HR=79, RR=20, O2=96% on NC
GEN: Pt responds to painful stimuli, morbidly obese
HEENT: nonicteric, mmm, PERRL, Nasal and OP is bloody from
intubation.
CHEST: diffuse rhonchi and no wheezing
CV: RRR, no murmers noted
ABD: obese, NT, +BS
EXT: trace LE edema bilaterally
NEURO/PSYCH: moves all 4 extremities and responsive to painful
stimuli.


Pertinent Results:
CTA CHEST [**2145-6-13**] - IMPRESSION: 1. Limited examination showing
no central or segmental pulmonary embolus. 2. Bilateral patchy
airspace opacities consistent with an infectious process, less
likely congestive heart failure. Clinical correlation is
recommended. 3. Aortic calcifications.

CXR- ETT at [**Female First Name (un) 5309**], left lung fluffy iniltrates and right lung
also looks worse compared to admission CXR.

ECHO [**2145-6-14**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function
appears grossly preserved but views are technically suboptimal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are probably
normal but views are suboptimal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

EEG [**2145-6-13**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence
of a
slow and disorganized background rhythm in the delta frequency
range
with occasional generalized delta frequency slowing. These
findings
suggest deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and are consistent
with an
encephalopathy. Common causes include medications, infection,
and
metabolic derangements. No lateralizing or epileptiform
abnormalities
were seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Distress-The etiology of the patients repiratory
distress was unclear.  The differential diagnosis initially
included seizure activity, ishemic cardiac event, hypercapnia
from asthma, viral pulmonary infection as initial insult,
congestive heart failure given increased weight gain for 3 weeks
prior to admission.

To address our cardiac concerns, cardiac enzymes were ordered
and she ruled out for an MI.  An ECHO was performed and due to
patients size was a suboptimal study, but results that were
obtained did not indicate severe diastolic or systolic
dysfunction.

Because of a history of temporal lobe epilepsy, it was
originally thought that the patients unresponsiveness prior to
ICU transfer may have been from seizure activity.  An EEG was
performed and no seizure activity was seen.

Blood and sputum cultures were sent, and the patient was started
on Levoquin and Flagyl empirically.  Because of a history of
epilepsy, the patient was switched to ceftriaxone and
azithromycin.  Because of extensive lung opacities on both CXR
and CT Thorax that were not improving, a bronchoscopy was
performed and BAL send for extensive cultures. Bronchoscopy neg
on [**6-15**]. Sputum cx from [**6-18**] showed gram MRSA on final culture
report. MRSA felt to be consistent with ventilator associated
pneumonia and she was placed on 10 day course of Vancomycin.
Other antibiotics were discontinued. She completed Vanco on [**6-29**]
and has remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable without
localizing symptoms.

After much investigation, the etiology of her respiratory
failure remains unclear. The leading differentital is
hypercapnia from underlying longstanding hypercapnic/hypoxic
state (i.e. asthma vs. obesity related), possible viral
pulmonary infection as initial insult, and ?congestive heart
failure given increased weight gain for 3 weeks prior to
admission. We have continued aggressive asthma treatment with
around the clock albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers + flovent
nebs. In addition she is continued on montelukast. In addition,
we have treated her clinical volume overload with diuresis on
lasix. Upon discharge she is on 20mg PO lasix per day and low
dose Ace-I.

She will benefit from a referral to pulmonary medicine for
pulmonary function tests and CT scan and f/u CXR to further
evaluate the nature of her underlying lung disease and the
progression of her current illness. PFT's are scheduled as
outlined on the discharge planning paperwork.

2. Hypotension - Upon transfer to the ICU the patient was
borderline hypotensive with MAP 50-60.  She was started on
phenylepherine.  She was weaned off within 24 hours and
continued to maintain her pressure the remainder of her hospital
course.

3. Transaminitis - on admission AST/ALT were 120/54 and trended
down during her time in the ICU.  No further w/u indicated at
this time.

4. Increased Lithium level-On admission patients lithium level
was 1.4.  As per psychiatry's recommendations, two doses were
held and she was restarted on 450mg/day (which was lower than
her dosage on admission). Her last level was 0.5 (goal 0.7-1.0),
but this level was felt to be appropriate per psychiatry,
therefore she was continued on 150mg TID.

5.FEN - Lactose free healthy heart diet. Monitoring lytes while
on lasix, Ace-I

6.Prophylaxis -SQ heparin, pneumatic boots,  H2 blocker, and
bowel regimin.
