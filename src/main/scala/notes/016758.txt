History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] is a 41yo F with AIDS, cardiomyopathy, asthma, CRF
who presents with two weeks of productive cough. Two weeks ago,
she developed a runny nose and a productive cough that was
stable for one week. Then, approximately one week ago, she began
developing a worsening cough with increasing sputum. The sputum
is green-yellow, without blood. She denies fevers, chills, night
sweats, chest pain (pleuritic or constant), SOB, DOE, orthopnea,
or PND. She has a history of disseminated MAC in [**6-/2173**] and PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2163**] and [**2170**]. She had been feeling well prior to this. She
currently denies HA, URI sx, neck pain, chest pain, SOB, abd
pain, back pain, n/v/d/c, dysuria/hematuria, or rash.
In the ED, she was hypothermic at 96.0 and hypotensive in the
60's, which improved to low 90's (her baseline per prior clinic
notes) with one liter NS. She got asa, atovaquone, and
levofloxacin.

Imaging:
[**2173-12-28**]: ECHO - Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with evere
global hypokinesis. No left ventricular thrombus is seen. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global
wall hypokinesis. The aortic leaflets are normal with good
excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is a small to moderate sized circumferential
pericardial effusion without evidence for tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-12-17**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly larger (specifically around
the right atrium). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is higher, right ventricular free
wall motion may be slightly worse, and the severities of mitral
and aortic regurgitation are slightly increased.
.
[**2173-12-27**]: portable abdominal film - No dilated loops of large or
small bowel are seen to indicate obstruction.  No definite free
intraperitoneal air is seen.  There are bilateral pleural
effusions with lower lobe airspace opacities.
.
[**2173-12-24**]: CT a/p - 1. New, bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater than left. Ground-glass opacities at the left lung base
may represent fluid overload. 2. Cardiomegaly with interval
marked enlargement of the cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] from the previous CT.
Moderate pericardial effusion. 3. Diffuse bowel wall thickening
involving the right colon to a greater extent than the left.
These findings may represent infectious colitis or possibly
typhlitis. 4. Anasarca.
.
[**2173-12-21**]: KUB - Non-specific bowel gas pattern. No air-fluid
levels to suggest obstruction.
.
[**12-18**]: CXR - 1. Stable cardiomegaly. 2. Improvement of the
perihilar opacities with residual opacities at the bases. This
may be secondary to resolving pulmonary edema or infectious
process.
.
[**12-17**]: ECHO - The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. LVEF <= 20%.
.
[**12-17**]: CXR - Successful placement of 39 cm total length double
lumen PICC line with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for
use.
.
[**12-16**]: portable CXR - 1. Enlarged cardiac silhouette suggesting
cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion, which has increased
compared to the prior examination. 2. Bilateral perihilar
opacities, likely due to pulmonary edema, increased compared to
the prior examination. Superimposed infection including PCP
cannot be excluded.
.
[**12-15**]: CXR - Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette suggesting
cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion that has progressed
compared to [**2173-8-13**]. Nonspecific bibasilar opacity suggests
edema or consolidation.
