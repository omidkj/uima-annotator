Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation (done at OSH)
Extubation


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 85686**] is a 76 year-old man with history
significant
for Left PCA-territory stroke in [**2101**] (details uncertain at this
time) and remote MI ([**2089**]) with ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
reportedly 35% per OSH notes), as well as HTN, HL, and mild
COPD.
The patient is intubated and unresponsive at this time and no
family is present and there are no contact numbers for family,
so
the minimal history at this point is derived from ED transfer
note from [**Last Name (un) 63261**] Hospital, where ED physicians spoke with
his wife.

Per OSH note, he was in his USOH last night when he went to bed
around 8pm with no complaints except that he was "slightly
congested." Around 5:15am this morning ([**11-1**], [**Holiday 1451**]
Day),
his wife was awakened by a "screaming noise" and a loug bang.
She
found him on the floor, convulsing and unresponsive. He
reportedly has no seizure history. She called EMS. EMS
reportedly
noted on-going convulsions on arrival (but we do not have their
documentation), which resolved spontaneously. They brought him
to
the OSH within roughly 20 minutes of onset. He arrived with VS
of
afebrile, HR 124, BP 136/86 - 190/113, RR 20, SaO2 96% RA, FSBG
134 at 06:40am.

There, he had a convulsive episode not witnessed by the ED
phsycian, which again self-resolved. On exam, his eyes were
open,
but he was not looking or moving on command. He was thought to
have a stroke because, although he moved LUE/LLE spontaneously,
he would not move the RUE to noxious stimulation, and only
weakly
withdrew the RLE one time to noxious stimulation. His Right toe
was up-going. His EKG had frequent PVCs and sinus tachycardia at
115. Routine lab studies were unremarkable (CBC, BMP, Ca,
CK/MB/trop, coags), except for dig <0.4 (he was listed as taking
dig as of 10/[**2102**]).

They did a NCHCT, which was said to show no hemorrhage or acute
changes (it is being uploaded into our PACS at this time). He
had
another convulsive episode at CT, so they gave him 2mg Ativan,
after which they intubated him (paralyzed/sedated
rapid-sequence,
with succ and etomidate) for unclear reason. He was pulling at
the ETT, so he was given fentanyl 100mcg bolus IV, after which
he
became hyPOtensive to the 70s SBP, so he was given IVF and
started on dopamine gtt. He was sedated with MDZ and fentanyl
gtt
and med-flighted over to [**Hospital1 18**]. Apparently he was given 2mg
Ativan en route by Med Flight staff, for agitation.

He arrived here intubated, sedated with midazolam and fentanyl.
VS on arrival were: afebrile (97.5) HR 74 BP 144/76 (on 0.4
norepinephrine gtt). RR 18/SaO2 100% on PEEP 5 / 100% FiO2. He
was not opening his eyes and not responsive to command, and the
ED staff said he moved his Right hand and both legs now. We were
consulted re. diagnosis and management.

norepi
RR 15-17 (set rate = 16)
SaO2 100% on FiO2 100% / PEEP 5

General: Intubated with OG tube. Lying in bed in NAD (sedating
meds -- fentanyl 50 and MDZ 1 were running, which I had stopped
on arrival). Smells of fresh (?cdiff) diarrhea.
HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic except for small lac below
left eye. No scleral icterus. Mucous membranes are moist. No
lesions noted in oropharynx.
Neck: exam limited by neck brace applied at OSH.
Pulmonary: Coarse lung sounds diffusely, bilaterally.
Non-labored; not overbreathing vent, but does buck briefly a
couple times after sedation is lifted.
Cardiac: RRR with occasional extra beat, normal S1/S2.
Abdomen: Mildly distended ++tympanic, esp epigastric / LUQ.
Non-tender. No bowel sounds appreciated in loud ED setting.

clubbing or cyanosis. No edema.

*****************
Neurologic examination:

best GCS after lifting sedating meds: 7 (E2 V1 M4)
level of arousal - 2 (opens eyes briefly to sternal rub)
best verbal - 1 (no verbal response to pain)
best motor - 4 (withdraws to pain)

Mental Status exam:
Eyes closed. Grimaces, bucks torso, and withdraws all
extremities
to mild noxious stimulation (sternal rub, mild nail-bed
pressure). Does not regard, track, or blink to threat (with eyes
held open). Does not follow command to open eyes or open/close
fist or show thumbs-up.

-Cranial Nerves:
II: Pupils round, equal, sluggish (Right pupil eccentrically
positioned on [**Doctor First Name 2281**], ?post-surgical change), 3 to 2.5mm. Does not
blink to threat anywhere.
III, IV, VI: Does not track or look on command. Eyes are both
mid-position. Neck brace limits VOR/OCR testing.
V: Weak corneals bilaterally. Strong grimace to nasopharyngeal
stimulation with cotton swab, bilaterally similar.
VII: Face grossly symmetric at rest. Symmetric grimace to pain.
VIII: Unable to test (neck brace limits OCRs; pt not responsive
to loud noise on either side).
IX, X: RT says cough and gag are robust at this time (tracheal
suctioning immediately prior to exam).
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: unable to test.
XII: unable to test.

-Motor: Moderately reduced tone of all four extremities at rest.
No adventitious movements, no tremor, no posturing or clonic
movements. Vigorous, immediate withdrawal of all four
extremities
to pain (mild nailbed pressure) in that extremity. No gross
assymetry.

-Sensory: responsive to mild noxious stimuli x four and face as
above.

-Reflex examination (left; right):
Biceps (++;++)
Triceps  (+;+)
Brachioradialis (++;++)
Quadriceps / patellar (++;++)
Gastroc-soleus / achilles (+;+)
Plantar response was EXTENSOR bilaterally, more rapidly up-going
on the RIGHT (left up-going with longer latency).

-Coordination: cannot test

-Gait: cannot test
