Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amlodipine / Diltiazem / Dilantin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
infrarenal AAA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 82 year old female with history of CHF with
preserved EF, HTN (left RAS), hx of CVA and seizure
disorder,gout, moderate AS who was initially admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] hospital on [**2182-7-25**] with chief complaint of DOE and SOB
with initial workup revealing for enterococcus and Group B Strep
UTI for which she was placed on levofloxacin. Blood cultures
subsequently revealed [**1-5**]+ cultures for MRSA on [**2182-7-27**]
prompting initiation of Vancomycin. However, her WBC increased
from 16K to 33K on [**2182-7-29**] for which Ceftaz was started for
broader coverage.
.
The patient began to complain of back and abdominal pain which
prompted an abdominal CT. This revealed an infrarenal aneurysm 4
x 2 cm that was not present on an Abd CT in [**2179**] or renal U/S
performed 3 weeks prior.
.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for vascular
evaluation.

MRA ABDOMEN W&W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-7-29**] 8:04 PM
1. Focal infrarenal aortic aneurysm with non-acute thrombus.
Whether this is a true anurysm or the result of remote
penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer is uncertain.
2. Right common iliac artery high-grade stenosis, with possible
focal dissection.
3. High-grade celiac artery stenosis.
4. High grade left renal artery stenosis.
5. Incompletely-assessed cystic renal lesions. Dedicated renal
MR imaging could be performed for optimal assessment.

ECHO Study Date of [**2182-7-30**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%), without regional wall motion abnormalitiesl. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are  normal. There
are three moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is moderate
aortic valve  stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets  are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation  is seen on the
mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-7-31**] 5:26 PM
1. Limited study without IV contrast. There is no bowel wall
thickening, dilations or pneumatosis to suggest bowel ischemia
at the current time.
2. Atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta, with a saccular
aneurysm at or just below the level of the renal arteries. The
presence or absence of dissection cannot be assessed on this
study, though the dimensions of the aorta do not appear
significantly changed from the prior MRI of [**7-29**]. There is
stranding surrounding the aneurysm of the aorta, raising the
possibility of a mycotic aneurysm or vasculitis.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
and small free fluid in the pelvis. Mild subcutaneous edema.
4. Coronary artery calcifications.
4. Fullness of the left adrenal.
5. Multiple renal lesions, not fully characterized on this
study. There is at least one hyperdense cyst.
6. Sigmoid diverticulosis.

IN-111 WHITE BLOOD CELL STUDY  [**2182-7-31**]
No definite evidence for myocotic aneurysm in infra-renal
abdominal aorta.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2182-8-4**] 6:29 PM
IMPRESSION: Probable lower lobe pneumonia with some failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: In summary, this is an 82 yo woman w/ h/o CHF, HTN,
moderate AS who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after initial treatment
at an OSH for dyspnea, where she was found to be bactermic and
found to have an new infrarenal AAA.  Other medical problems
that complicated this hosptialization included acute on chronic
renal failure and delirium.
.
She was initially admitted to vascular surgery in the intensive
care unit, subsequently transfered to the MICU, and called out
to the medicine floor on [**2182-8-3**].
.
AAA: The apparent development of the 4.5 cm AAA over a three
week period was very concerning for high likelihood of rupture.
Given her bacteremia, there was concern this might be a mycotic
aneurysm, however the tagged WBC scan was negative.  She was
deemed a poor candidate for surgical intervention.  Treatment
focused on BP control
.
Bacteremia: Ms. [**Known lastname 69602**] was continued on vancomycin IV.  Official
TTE read was negative for endocarditis; though a prolonged
course of vancomycin 4-6 weeks was planned given her known
bactermia, AAA, and as a TEE was not performed. Given her
rapidly changing renal function, daily Vancomycin levels were
obtained to determine when to dose the vancomycin.
.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 69602**] had underlying
chronic renal failure with a baseline of Cr of 2.5.  Her Cr
peaked during the hospital stay at 3.7.  She was deemed not to
be a hemodialysis candidate.  The day prior to her death she was
noted to be hypernatremic; her tube feed free water boluses were
increased and she was started on D5W to replete her calculated
free water deficit. Lasix was held given the concern of her
renal function.
.
Respiratory:
On the night of [**8-4**] to [**8-5**] Ms. [**Known lastname 69602**] was noted to have
increased work of breathing which did not improve with nebs or
respiratory suction. Her CXR earlier in the day demonstrated
probable new lower lobe pneumonia with some failure; ABG
revealed marked acidosis. She subsequently became hypotensive.
As she was DNR/DNI, her health care proxy was [**Name (NI) 653**]; given
her poor prognosis he declared her comfort measures only.
