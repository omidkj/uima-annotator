History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 77 yo male with a
history of CAD s/p CABG in '[**81**] (lima to lad, svg to om, svg to
rca, svg to D1), redo one vessel CABG [**2191**] with an SVG to OM,
MIs in [**2191**] and [**2195**], multiple PCIs, 5 cm AAA, and ESRD on HD
TUES/THURS/SAT who presented to [**Hospital3 **] with refractory chest
pain on [**2198-12-29**]. His last cath at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2195**] revealing severe
CAD (Occluded SVG-OM, SVG to DIAG and SVG to RCA, patent SVG to
OM) intervention was felt to be high-risk and the patient was
medically managed.
.
Vitals at OSH: 142/73, sat 99% on 2lnc, sinus 70's no ectopy,
Temp 99.3. EKG at [**Hospital3 417**] showed ST depressions in III,
II, AVF, V4-V6 per the referring cardiologist. Troponins were
0.01->0.7. He was transfused 1 unit PRBC's for Hct 24 (guaic
negative), bumped to 31.
.
He had multiple episodes of chest pain overnight-described as
vague discomfort that pt does not rate on pain scale-occurs with
activity such as trying to void, moving for CXR, all relieved
with Morphine 2mg.
.
Arrived to CCU after cath and currently chest pain free. Denies
feeling SOB, n, v, f, c.  +constipation
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain
currently, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2198-12-31**] Cath
COMMENTS:     1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant
system
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
severe
diffuse disease up to 80%. The LAD was occluded proximally. The
LCx had
severe diffuse disease. The RCA was known occluded and was not
engaged.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent LIMA-LAD. The
SVG-OM
was ectatic with moderate disease, TIMI 3 flow, not changed in
appearance from cath [**2195**]. The SVG-Diag and SVG-RCA were
occluded.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided
filling
pressures with LVEDP of 28 mmHg and RVEDP of 11 mmHg. There was
moderate-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP of 53
mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.1 L/min/m2. There was
systemic
systolic arterial hypertension with SBP 142 mmHg on
Nitroglycerine drip
at a max dose of 140 mcg/min.
4. Left ventriculography was not performed.
5. Left subclavian angiography revealed a moderate stenosis with
a
dissection cap. The pressure gradient with IV ntg 100 mcg was 7
mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG-OM and LIMA-LAD.
3. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Moderate-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
5. Pressure gradient of left subclavian insignificant after IC
.
TTE [**2199-1-1**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with a basal inferior aneurysm/akinesis, as well as
akinesis of the septul, and hypokinesis of the inferolateral
wall (c/w multivessel CAD). There is mild hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 30%). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. The estimated cardiac index is borderline
low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. There are three aortic valve leaflets.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Mild
right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate-to-severe
mitral regurgitation. Moderate-to-severe tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

engaged. Arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent
LIMA-LAD. The SVG-OM was ectatic with moderate disease, not
changed in appearance from cath [**2195**]. The SVG-Diag and SVG-RCA
