HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 46-year-old female
status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2115**] for FSGS, who
has a history of diabetes mellitus and CHF, who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**12-26**] with two days of exertional
dyspnea.  She does have home oxygen requirements.  She
started using 2 liters for symptomatic relief and she has a
cough productive of pink frothy sputum.  At the time of that
presentation, she also was hyperglycemic as high as 792,
temperature of 101.2.

Her hospital course at [**Hospital1 487**] was notable for aggressive
diuresis.  She had a broad infectious disease workup for
question of a right lower lobe pneumonia and had been on a
variable antibiotic region.  Her initial workup was negative
for pulmonary embolism, so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2120-12-26**] for further
workup.

4. Hypertension.
5. Gout.
6. Osteoporosis.
7. Depression.

1. Status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2115**].
2. Status post open cholecystectomy.

day, occasional alcohol.  By occupation she is a computer
programmer.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS UPON TRANSFER FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:
1. Neoral 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Insulin NPH 30/70.  Humalog sliding scale.

8. Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.4, blood pressure
169/76, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 23.  She is satting
90%.  CVP was 20.  Her initial ABG was pH 7.35, pCO2 of 34,
pO2 of 52, a bicarb of 20, and a base deficit of -5.
Generally she looked uncomfortable, but able to conduct a
conversation using accessory muscles.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat:  She had a slight proptosis on the right,
no thyromegaly, no cervical adenopathy.  Chest is normal for
rales at the bases bilaterally.  Heart was regular, rate, and
rhythm.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.  Her right lower
quadrant graft was nontender.  Extremities were with some
bilateral leg edema.  She had palpable DP and PT bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  White count 11.4, hematocrit 28.7, platelets
of 360.  Sodium of 136, potassium 5.1, chloride of 105,
bicarb of 18, BUN of 59.  Creatinine of 3.9.  Glucose of 234.
Her AST was 12, ALT was 16.  A sputum culture obtained on
[**12-27**] indicated 2+ gram-positive cocci, 1+
gram-positive rods, and 1+ gram-negative rods.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 46-year-old female
with a history of diabetes mellitus and CHF as well as
hypertension, who was admitted from an outside hospital with
respiratory distress as well as renal failure.  Her
creatinine was noted to be 3.9, which is elevated from a
baseline of 2.5.  She appeared to be somewhat fluid
overloaded as well as having a component of pneumonia.

An echocardiogram was obtained to assess cardiac function.
Her ejection fraction was 55% with some dilatation in the
left atrium.  Infectious Disease was consulted.  She is
placed on a two week course of oxacillin and three week
course of levofloxacin.  She was noted to have
methicillin-sensitive Staph aureus in her sputum.  She
required intubation until adequate diuresis was achieved.
Cardiology was consulted to maximize cardiac function and to
evaluate this episode of mild pulmonary edema as well as
congestive heart failure.

After adequate volume status was achieved, patient was
eventually weaned off the vent and extubated.  It was thought
that her renal failure was attributed to prerenal component
and perhaps a component of acute tubular necrosis.  Her renal
function eventually resolved and returned back to baseline.
Oxygen requirements eventually were weaned.  She was
eventually transferred to the floor.  At that point, she was
requiring 5 liters of nasal cannula as well as BiPAP at
night.  Physical Therapy evaluated the patient and
recommended that the patient be discharged home with a supply
of oxygen as well as outpatient pulmonary rehab in addition
of BiPAP at night.

At the time of discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet.
She functionally was improved, however, due to her
desaturation with increased activity, it was recommended by
Physical Therapy as well as Respiratory to continue with
oxygenation at home, to continue levofloxacin for another
additional week.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Home with outpatient pulmonary
rehab.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable and guarded.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

scales.  This will be provided for the patient.
13. BiPAP at night; BiPAP ST [**1-11**] backup rate of 10 with a
bleed in of oxygen at 6 liters continuous.  In addition, she
is to have pulmonary rehab.
14. Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.d. for seven more days.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Patient is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14252**] at

was instructed to call to schedule an appointment for her
convenience.  She additionally prefers to followup with her
own primary care physician for blood sugar control at the
[**Hospital **] Clinic.  She is to continue with outpatient pulmonary
rehab, supply of oxygen.
