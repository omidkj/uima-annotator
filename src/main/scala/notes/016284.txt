IMAGING:
[**11-18**] CXR: 1. Multiple bilateral rib fractures with subcutaneous
emphysema. There is likely a small right pneumothorax. 2. Right
proximal clavicular displaced fracture.
[**11-18**] CT Torso: Fracture of right clavicle, multiple ribs
bilaterally.
small to moderate right Pneumothorax with pulmonary
hemorrhage/contusion and lacerations. Tiny left pneumothorax.
Right renal laceration without collecting system injury. Splenic
laceration with active extravasation.
[**11-18**] CT Head: Multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages at
grey-white junction and in midbrain c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**11-18**]: CT C-Spine: no acute fracture of cervical spine.
[**11-18**]: CT Facial: Fracture of left frontal bone extending to
postero superior medial wall of orbit. fracture of lateral wall
of left orbit. Communited fracture of floor of left orbit
without muscle entrapment, but fragment impinging on inferior
rectus with adjacent stranding and blood. Communited fracture of
left zygomatic arch. antero, posterolateral and medial wall
fracture of left maxillary sinus with some fragments in sinus
itself. Inferior to right orbit is a small locule of gas, which
raises suspicion for fracture although no definite fracture
seen. Fracture of bony nasal septum. Comminuted fracture of
right condylar process without dislocation. Fracture of
left mandibular ramus. Left orbital proptosis with globe intact.

[**11-18**] XR L FOREARM/ELBOW/WRIST: 1. No evidence of fracture,
dislocation about the elbow. 2. External devices limit
evaluation of the region of the wrist. Within this limitation,
irregular linear lucencies in the distal radius may represent
non-displaced radial fractures. Recommend repeat radiographs.
[**11-18**] XR R TIB/FIB: 1. Minimally displaced fractures of the
medial malleolus and distal fibula. 2. Focal sclerosis within
the proximal tibial shaft may represent an enchondroma versus
infarct.
[**11-19**] XR B/L HAND: 1. Right hand acute thumb metacarpal
fracture.
2. Right hand old scaphoid fracture with SNAC wrist. 3. Probable
non-displaced right radial styloid fracture. 4. Acute left small
finger proximal phalanx intra-articular comminuted fracture. 5.
Probable non-displaced left ring finger proximal phalanx
fracture. 6. Possible left distal radius fracture.
[**11-19**] XR L KNEE/TIB/FIB: no fx
[**11-19**] CT HEAD: 1. Interval evolution of multiple
intraparenchymal contusions. 2. Interval extension into the
ventricle with blood layering in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
lateral ventricles. 3. No hydrocephalus. No subfalcine or uncal
herniation. 4. Multiple facial fractures
[**11-19**] CXR: No evidence of pneumothorax after bronch with stable
appearance of the bilateral pulmonary opacifications and two
right-sided chest tubes.
[**11-20**]:Orogastric tube ends in the upper stomach but should be
advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE junction.
ET tube is in standard placement. Left lower lobe consolidation
has not changed since earlier in the day, but has developed over
the past 24 hours. Two right apical pleural tubes are still in
place, and there is no appreciable pneumothorax or right pleural
effusion. Remainder of the lungs are clear. Upper mediastinum
normal. ET tube is in standard placement. Left subclavian line
ends at the junction of
brachiocephalic veins.
[**11-21**]: Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. ET tube in standard
placement. Right apical pleural drain still in place. Left
subclavian line ends at the junction of brachiocephalic veins.
Left lower lobe remains collapsed although lung volumes have
improved and vascular congestion has decreased. Small left
pleural effusion is stable.
[**11-22**] CXR: worsening pulmonary edema, worsening L pleural
effusion and RLL ground glass opacity, unchanged [**Name (NI) 14245**] PTX
[**11-24**] CXR: left costophrenic angle not included in field. right
pleural effusion improved since prior. small retrocardiac
opacificaiton may represent technique/pt positioning, however
atelectasis vs infection can't be excluded in correct clinical
setting.
[**11-26**] CXR:1. Possible tiny right apical pneumothorax with right
chest tube in place. 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with
associated atelectasis, greatest in the left lower lobe.
[**11-27**] CXR: The right chest tube is in unchanged position with
its tip terminating at the right apex. There is no change in the
left subclavian line tip, which is in the superior SVC.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, left retrocardiac
consolidation is unchanged and the right basal opacity, the last
two most likely representing atelectasis, although infection
cannot be excluded. No appreciable pneumothorax is seen.
[**11-29**]: CXR: Right jugular line passes to the mid SVC. The
pneumothorax demonstrated by a torso CT scan performed earlier
today is not visible, no appreci
