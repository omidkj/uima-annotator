Patient is a 74 year old male with a past medical history of
hypertension, coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft, congestive heart failure with known
ejection fraction of 35%, hypercholesterolemia, and atrial
fibrillation status post cardioversion one year ago, not on
Coumadin therapy at the present moment, who presented on
[**2175-8-23**] as a transfer from [**Hospital **] Hospital with weakness,
slurred speech.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for TPA thrombolytic therapy.  Here
magnetic resonance scan demonstrated evidence of a right
sided MCA stroke. After obtaining a signed informed consent from
the family, the patient was given 0.9 mg/kg of TPA according to
the DIFFUSE protocol and at 3:30 a.m.

During the initial presentation, he never complained of chest
pain, shortness of breath.  After TPA did have improvement of
his left sided facial weakness but was noted to have left
sided hemineglect and hemiparesis which remained severe
status post TPA.  He was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit for further monitoring.  On [**2175-8-24**], the patient began
to complain of an episode of chest pain which began that
morning.  The pain was described as centered over the left
chest "raking" [**7-9**] in severity, lasting about 30 minutes not
associated with any nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis,
palpitations or shortness of breath.  For this pain, the
patient received 2 mg of intravenous morphine and was started
on intravenous nitroglycerin drip.  He was also given aspirin
and Plavix.  He had his cardiac enzymes including CK and
troponin cycled times three and was ruled out for myocardial
infarction.

At that time he was not heparinized, but he was started on
Coumadin.  He was receiving intravenous Metoprolol 10-15 mg
intravenous for heart rate greater than 70 in the
Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit for rate control of his
atrial fibrillation.  He was pain-free on the intravenous
nitroglycerin drip until approximately 9:00 p.m. on [**2175-8-25**].
At that time, he had a recurrent episode of chest pain, same
description lasting minutes, which resolved on its own.

Per the patient's cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8421**], the patient has a
history of coronary artery bypass graft performed [**3-/2168**] with
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to OM-1/diagonal.

Follow-up catheterization on [**2173-3-30**] showed severe three
vessel disease, ejection fraction of 50%, saphenous vein
graft to right posterior descending artery graft occluded,
saphenous vein graft OM-1 graft occluded with diagonal open.
Left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
graft was patent at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post right middle cerebral artery stroke status
post thrombolytic therapy with TPA in [**8-2**].
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft 7 years ago with left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to right
posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to
OM-1/diagonal.  Follow-up catheterization [**3-30**] with severe
three vessel disease, ejection fraction 50%, saphenous vein
graft to right posterior descending artery occluded,
saphenous vein graft to OM-1 occluded but diagonal open.
Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
patent at that time.
3.  History of chronic atrial fibrillation status post
cardioversion approximately two years ago.  The patient noted
to be in normal sinus rhythm on Cardiology office visit in
[**2175-2-28**].  However, on presentation with his acute stroke
was found to be in atrial fibrillation, not on Coumadin.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Status post cholecystectomy.

ALLERGIES:
The patient reports allergies to penicillin resulting in
rash.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Sotalol 80 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Isosorbide.
6.  Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.

retired from work in advertising.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient reports positive family history
of coronary artery disease and cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission, temperature 98.8,
blood pressure 133/70, heart rate 64, oxygen saturation 98%

response of 65 beats/min.

Magnetic resonance scan showed area of diffusion, swelling
and right MCA in one branch.  The vessels were poor flow over
the right MCA and ICA.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cerebrovascular accident, the patient was felt to have a
right middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke in the setting
of atrial fibrillation with significant left sided
hemiparesis.  While he was outside the FDA approvement of her
TPA he qualified for the DIFUFE study and was consented to a
trial of TPA thrombolysis.  He was given TPA without any
complications.  Immediately post TPA infusion, he was noted
to have slight resolution of his left sided facial weakness
and asymmetry.  However, his dense left sided hemiparesis
remained.  He was monitored TPA in the Neurosurgical
Intensive Care Unit for several days.  On [**2175-8-25**] follow-up
CT scan showed hemorrhagic transformation of his infarct.
Therefore, aspirin and Coumadin therapy were withdrawn.
Initially he found a swallow evaluation and so nasogastric
tube was placed and he was fed through nasogastric tube per
Nutrition recommendations.

Over the course of the next several days his neurological
status improved somewhat with increased sensation and tone in
his left side.  He had follow-up speech swallow evaluation on
[**2175-8-28**] and was able to tolerate soft puree foods, thin
liquids, able to tolerate having his meds crushed in puree
food with the understanding that he would be fed in the bolt
upright position.  On [**2175-8-28**], the patient's outpatient dose
of Lipitor was reinstated.  On [**2175-8-29**] after discussion with
Neurology staff, he was able to tolerate initiation of
aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.  In terms of restarting the patient
for anticoagulation on Coumadin in light of his history of
stroke and atrial fibrillation, it was felt that the bleeding
risk and evidence of hemorrhagic transformation on CT was too
great to tolerate the benefit of anticoagulation therapy.
The patient is to have a follow-up head CT performed around
[**2175-9-7**].  Pending results of that CT Neurology to
decide whether initiation of heparin and W
