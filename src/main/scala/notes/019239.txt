Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2199-12-14**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Mild-moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mitral
valve annuloplasty ring. No MS. Normal LV inflow pattern for
age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate PA
systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Frequent ventricular premature beats.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and
apex. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral
valve annuloplasty ring is present. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2199-12-14**] ,
there is now a mitral valvuloplasty ring in position. There is
no mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is slightly lower.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ? effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old woman with s/p cabg mv repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? effusion
HISTORY: CABG and MVR repair.

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**12-16**], the endotracheal
tube and nasogastric tube have been removed. The Swan-Ganz
catheter tip now lies within the proximal right pulmonary
artery. Left chest tube remains in place. Some atelectatic
changes are again seen at the bases.

PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, [**2199-12-18**]

COMPARISON: Previous study of earlier the same day.

INDICATION: Chest tube removal.

Following removal of left-sided chest tube, no pneumothorax is
identified. Mediastinal drain has also been removed. Swan-Ganz
catheter remains in place with tip terminating in proximal left
pulmonary artery. Vascular engorgement and perihilar haziness
are minimally improved. Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly
improved and right pleural effusion appears slightly smaller.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**12-13**]  from EMMC, and pre-op workup completed over the
weekend. Underwent CABG x3/MV repair with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**12-16**].
Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on levophed,
milrinone, epinephrine, and insulin drips. Extubated on POD #1,
and went into A fib overnight. Converted with amiodarone. Given
48 hours of peiop vancomycin as she was in the hospital
preoperatively. Flagyl started for C. diff. Chest tubes and
pacing wires removed without incident. Vanco PO also started.
Drips also weaned over the next few days. Beta blockade titrated
and gentle diuresis continued. Coumadin and amiodarone started
for continued Afib. Remained in the CVICU over the weekend as
private room not avail. on the floor given C. Diff. Cleared for
discharge to rehab on POD #8 Target INR 2.0-2.5 for A fib.
