Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**]
Chief Complaint:
urosepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CMO

History of Present Illness:
84M with advanced dementia, atrial fibrillation, CHF (EF 25%),
BPH presenting from rehab with acute renal failure and urinary
tract infection/hematuria.
He was noted to have an increase of creatinine from 1.2 to 2.6.
He was started on a cefepime for a proteus urinary tract
infection diagnosed on [**2132-7-29**]. He had an ultrasound on
[**2132-7-28**] that showed hydronephrosis.
Of note, he is confused at baseline but seems more agitated
recently. He has no documented fevers. He denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, vomiting.
In addition, patient was admitted from [**2132-6-13**] to [**2132-6-19**] for
confusion x 1 days and noted to have a congestive heart failure
exacerbation. Cardiology evaluation and consultation advised
medical management and ECHO showed wall motion abnormalities
consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
He was also noted that have a 3 month cognitive decline, which
was corroborated with his wife and [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy
[**Name (NI) **].
In the ED, initial VS were: Triage 12:51 0 99.5 74 92/66 16 92%

He was noted to have a foley with purulent red urine. His was
AAOx1 and very lethargic (said "yes" to some questions) - he has
been like this for past 4 weeks per wife. [**Name (NI) **] does have history
of attacking people at rehab.
Current access includes left PICC and 18G on right arm.
He was given cefepime at 11:30 AM today and vancomycin 1gm IV in
[**Hospital1 18**] ER.
His initial SBP was in the 90s, which then dropped to the 80s.
He was given 250 mL normal saline with SBP 100-110s.
Labs were performed
- Lactate 2.4
- cTropnT 0.05
- Na 141, Cl 105, K 3.6, HCO3 20, BUN 55, Cr 3, Glc 95
- ALT 31, AST 97, ALP 97, Lipase 12, tbili 0.8, Alb 3.4
- WBC 25.2, Hgb 13.4, Plt 171 Diff N 93.8 L 3.3 INR 1.5
- UA Cloudy, pH 9, Tbili Lg, LE Lg, Nit Pos, Prot > 300, Glu >
1000, Ket 150, RBC > 182, WBC > 182, Bacteria None
A prelim CT Abd showed no renal stones, discrepancy in renal
size (11cm right, 7.4cm left) likely reflects chronic kidney
disease. Moderate perinephric stranding is consistent with
pyelonephritis in the appropriate clinical setting, which
appears worse on the right. A foley is present within the
bladder, which is decompressed. A recently passed stone could
also account for these findings although none is seen. In
addition, there was moderate cardiomegaly. Overall, this scan is
limited by lack of contrast and respiratory motion, but
no other significant abnormalities are detected.
Blood and urine cultures were obtained; however, patient did
receive antibiotics before arrival at rehab.
He is being admitted to the ICU for sepsis with hemodynamic
changes including tachycardia in 110-120s and relative SBP 90s.


On arrival to the MICU pt had an episode of pulseless VTACH,
spontaneously converted. he was dyspneic and received IV metop
5mg x 1 for RVR, lasix 20 IV, IV morphine.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 yo gentleman with PMH of ischemic congestive
heart failure with depressed ejection fracture, atrial
fibrillation not on anti-coagulation, moderate dementia, mild
expressive aphasia who was admitted to the MICU with urosepsis
and made CMO.

# Sepsis from a urinary source (pyelonephritis): On presentation
to the ED, the patient met [**1-12**] SIRS criteria and he had a
urinary tract infection per UA.  He had an elevated lactate at
24.  He was hypotensive and unable to be fluid resuscitated due
to worsening respiratory status. He was started on pressors with
improvement in his BP.  He was started on Vanc/Cefepime and
Ciprofloxacin for antibiotics and he was admitted to the ICU. In
the ICU he continued to be hypotensive and was volume
resuscitated which transiently improved his hemodynamics, but
was complicated by acute pulmonary edema (attributed to his
depressed EF and 3+ MR). In addition, he developed A fib with
RVR in the acute setting and was treated with beta blockade, but
subsequently developed frequeny runs of non-sustained V tach.
Despite these interventions, the patient continued to clinically
deteriorate hemodynamically and respiratorially. He was DNR/I on
admission and given the accuity and severity of his acute
presentation and his progressive deterioration despite
aggressive medical management with broad spectrum antibiotics,
goal-directed volume resuscitation, supplemental oxygen, and
beta-blockade, the decision was made, in concert with his wife,
health care proxy (attorney [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]), and his primary care
provided (Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**]), to transition to CMO care. The
patient passed away within several hours of transitioning his
goals of care. He appeared to be comfortable, without pain or
dyspnea. The time of death was 3:14PM, [**2132-8-1**]. His
wife, health care proxy, and primary care provider were
informed. The medical examiner was contact[**Name (NI) **] as the patient had
died within 24 hours of admission and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9037**] declined the
case.
