Left sided chest pain

none


History of Present Illness:
77 yo F with PMH of HTN who presented to her PCP's due to 6 days

Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Thrombus in the main and right pulmonary artery may be
identified (views suboptimal). Cannot exclude right atrial
thrombus (views suboptimal)

Reason: evaluate aortic arch ulcer seen on CT at OSH
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old woman with bilateral/saddle PE's, new LUL lung mass
and report of penetrating aortic arch atherosclerotic ulcer
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate aortic arch ulcer seen on CT at OSH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT OF THE CHEST:

CLINICAL HISTORY: 77-year-old woman with saddle pulmonary
embolism, new left upper lobe lung mass and reports of
penetrating aortic arch atherosclerotic ulcer.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were initially obtained
through the chest with a low-dose technique without contrast
followed by contrast-enhanced images through the chest utilizing
a pulmonary embolism protocol. Coronal, sagittal, and oblique
reformatted images were also obtained.

There are extensive pulmonary emboli involving the Upper and
lower lobes. Pulmonary emboli are seen in both main pulmonary
arteries, segmental and subsegmental branches. A linear thrombus
is seen extending between the main left and right pulmonary
arteries, compatible with saddle embolus.

The heart is mildly enlarged. Note is made of coronary artery
calcifications. There is no pericardial effusion. The thoracic
aorta is normal in caliber. The ascending thoracic aorta, for
example, measures 3.4 x 3.4 cm. Extensive atherosclerotic
calcifications are seen throughout the thoracic aorta. In
addition, the aortic arch contains a prominent peripheral
atherosclerotic plaque. However, there is no evidence of aortic
dissection or focal atherosclerotic ulcer.

Small subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are seen that do not
meet CT criteria for malignancy. There is no hilar or axillary
lymphadenopathy.

There is a spiculated, poorly defined area in the left upper
lobe (series 3, image 16) that measures approximately 1.1 x 2.7
cm. Abdominal windows demonstrate large amount of thrombus
within the pulmonary artery branches in this region, and this
area therefore, may represent a focal pulmonary infarct.
However, other underlying pathology cannot be excluded.
Therefore, attention should be drawn to this region on
subsequent examination to assess for interval change.

There is a small left pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis
(left greater than right). Nonspecific pleural thickening is
evident along the medial aspects of both hemithoraces.

Limited images through the upper abdomen demonstrate several
small hepatic cysts. In addition, there are several cystic
lesions in the right kidney that are only partially included on
an unenhanced portion of examination,and probably represent
renal cysts.

BONE WINDOWS: There are multilevel degenerative changes in the
thoracic spine. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with a saddle embolus
component.

2. Spiculated opacity in the left upper lobe, probably
reflecting a focal pulmonary infarction. However,an underlying
neoplasm cannot be excluded. Attention should be drawn to this
region on subsequent examinations to assess for interval change.

3. Small left pleural effusion. Bibasilar atelectasis.

4. Extensive peripheral plaque in the aortic arch. No evidence
of aortic dissection or focal atherosclerotic ulcer.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT

Reason: SADDLE EMBOLI, BILAT DUPLEX TO ASSESS FOR DVT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old woman saddle PE
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
bilat duplex to assess for dvt
INDICATION: 77-year-old female with PE, assess bilateral legs
for DVT.

COMPARISON: No previous exams for comparison.

FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral
common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins
were performed. Normal flow, compression and augmentation are
seen in all of the vessels of the right leg. In the left leg,
there is incomplete compression and slow flow seen in the common
femoral and the superficial femoral veins indicating
nonocclusive thrombus within those vessels. No DVT is seen in
the deep femoral vein or the popliteal vein of the left leg.

IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus identified in the left common
femoral and superficial femoral veins. No DVT seen in the right
leg.

These findings were communicated to N.P. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] at about
2:00pm on [**2181-1-9**].
