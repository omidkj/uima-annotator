Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
diaphoresis, shortness of breath, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath with stent to SVG-RCA and three stents to SVG-OM1.


History of Present Illness:
78 M with CAD, CABG x 2, AVR/MVR,HTN, hypercholesterolemia, who
was USOH until Friday night when he went up stairs to bed and
suddenly became diaphoretic and short of breath. Continued until
he sat down and the chest pain lasted minutes. This was similar
to the chest pain he had when he had an MI. He took one NTG pain
resolved. Made bed in the am and again had chest pain,
diaphoresis, SOB. He told his wife he had chest pain all night
which radiated to his arm. Since Sat am, he has had chest pain
with exertion, took another NTG today. No palps, N/V/no PND, no
orthopnea. Got NTG x 2 in ED. Currently with pain.

Pt states he had many episodes of diaphoresis, his angina begins
with bilaterally terrible wrist pain. Had increased SOB. He
notes that 2 months ago he had a GIB. He saw Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 349**] who
prescribed citrucel and other bowel regimen. Pt states he notes
some blood on the toilet paper, but no clots or fresh blood. He
denies itching, pain in his anus. Notes that diaphoresis as a
harbinger of his atrial fibrillation. He did have dizziness
Sat., some chills now.

In the ED, he was afebrile, HR 86, BP 111/77, 98% RA. Noted to
be ill appearing, uncomfortable, [**Month (only) **] BS at bases, [**3-14**] SM, guiac
++ with red clots. EKG in ED showed NSR at 87 bpm, left axis, nl
PR/QRS, LVH old TWI in avL, I, ST elevations in V1/V2 (new),
III, avF (?change from baseline). Troponin 0.66. Seen by GI and
Cards in ED.  He was taken to cardiac catheterization from the
ED for persistent chest pain on a nitroglycerin drip. Cardiac
catheterization revealed a right-dominant ciculation, LMCA with
severe diffuse disease, proximal LCx occlusion, RCA occluded
proximally, SVG-RCA with an ostial 99% lesion and SVG-OM1
proximal 80% and distal 90%. The patient had PTCA and 2 Cypher
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] to SVG-OM graft and PTCA and stent to SVG-RCA. The
patient was noted to have elevated pressures (PCWP 16, RA 11, PA
43/26) and was transferred to CCU for hemodynamic support as he
was briefly on a Dobutamine drip after the right heart
catheterization. In the CCU, he received Lasix for diuresis, was
maintained on dobutamine overnight and received 2U FFP prior to
sheath pull (INR 2.5). He was also transfused 1U PRBC (followed
by Lasix) for hematocrit of 28.5 on the afternoon of [**2117-3-22**].
Echocardiogram on [**3-22**] showed EF<20%, apical akinesis. He was
subsequently weaned off Dobutamine.

CXR: cardiomegaly, widened mediastimum, CABG clips, LL base scar
unchanged, LL base with atelectasis

Echo ([**3-22**]): Markedly dilated LA and RA. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis. EF<20%. The
apex is mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic.

EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. A-V conduction
delay. The
P-R interval is 0.21. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Left
anterior fascicular block. T wave inversion in leads I, aVL and
V4-V6 as previously recorded. These findings are consistent with
anterolateral ischemia. The Q-T interval remains prolonged. No
diagnostic interim change.

Cath:
  1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease.
  2. SVG to RCA with 99% ostial lesion.
  3. SVG to OM with 80% proximal and 90% distal lesions.
  4. Moderate reduced ventricular function.
  5. Successful placement of drug-eluting stent in SVG-RCA.
  6. Successful placement of drug-eluting stents in SVG-OM1.

Colonoscopy:
Findings:
Flat Lesions Multiple angioectasias due to previous radiation
therapy were seen up to 10 cm into the rectum. These findings
are consistent with radiation proctitis. An Argon-Plasma
Coagulator was applied for hemostasis successfully.

Impression: 1. Radiation proctitis up to 10 cm from anal verge.
Recommendations: Patient will need repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy
with argon-plasma coagulation to further treat radiation
proctitis. He has been scheduled for [**2117-4-28**] at 9:00 AM
at GI endoscopy unit, [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] Building, [**Location (un) **], [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].
Patient should arrive by 8:00 AM.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 103271**] is a 78 male with CAD, CABG x 2, AVR/MVR,HTN,
Hypercholesterolemia, who presents with episode of diaphresis
and shortness of breath, with EKG changes and positive cardiac
enzymes.  Pt underwent cath showing SVG-RCA 99%, SVG-OM1
proximal 80% & distal 90%.  Four drug-eluding stents were
placed, including 1 to SVG-RCA, 2 to proximal SVG-OM1 and 1 to
distal SVG-OM1.  Pt was transferred to the CCU with elevated
LVEDP (22) on dobutamine, in the setting of a distal GI bleed.

1. STEMI s/p Four Drug Eluding Stents:  Pt was diuresed in the
CCU and quickly weaned off dobutamine.  He remained stable
throughout his hospital stay.  Pt was maintained on ASA, Plavix,
a beta-blocker, and statin.  Pt refused Lipitor 80mg, but was
agreeable to 20mg QD.

2. CHF: Pt's EF was < 20%, down from his prior estimation of
45%.  His LVEDP in the cath lab was 22, which improved with
diuresis.  Pt was maintained on an Ace inhibitor, with daily
Lasix and Spironolactone.

3. Apical akinesis: Pt needs long-term anticoagulation from a
cardiology perspective to prevent ventricular thrombus and
subsequent stroke.  However, pt had lower GI bleeding when
placed on heparin and coumadin and therefore did not tolerate
anti-coagulation at this time.  He may tolerate anti-coagulation
upon further resolution of his radiation proctitis.

4. Paroxismal Atrial fib
