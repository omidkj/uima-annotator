Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p mechanical fall, displaced nail from L hip repair


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Conversion of left failed hip fixation to hip hemiarthroplasty
with bone grafting and removal of an existing TFN implant

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yoF with HTN, HLD, glaucoma s/p L intertrochanteric hip
fracture repair with intramedullary nail placement [**2151-12-28**]
presenting from rehab for left hip pain and drainage from the
site of the procedure.
.
In brief, the patient was found to have displacement of the nail
into the acetabulum and underwent left hemiarthroplasty repair
[**2152-2-17**]. She received 2 units PRBC intra-op for a 900cc blood
loss, and received 2 additional units PRBC, 1 unit FFP, 250cc
albumin, and 500cc bolus NS for SBP 80's and Hct 30.2 in the
PACU. She also received Lasix 10mg IV. SBP increased to
100's-110's subsequently with a total I/O in the PACU of
3.3L/1.1 for net postive 2.2L. In this context, she was noted to
have decreased UOP, increased lethargy, and hypoxia of 88% 3L on
transfer to the floor and subsequently required a NRB for PO2
mid-90's. She was given Lasix 20mg IV with mild improvement to
PO2 92% on 5L NC, and unclear urine output. She was also noted
to be in acute renal failure 1.4 -> 1.8 with an unclear
baseline. She was noted to be disoriented and lethargic, and
medicine was consulted. The patient was transferred to the MICU
team for further management.
.
In the MICU, the patient received Lasix 20mg IV for diuresis and
was negative 1L overnight. Her PO2 improved to 97-98% on 4L NC
and was to be called out yesterday, but had an episode of
desaturation to low 90s on 4L NC and the patient was monitored
for another night in the MICU without any further episodes of
hypoxia. The etiology of the episode of hypoxia was unclear. She
has been stable and breathing comfortably without hypoxia since.

.
Currently, the patient denies shortness of breath, chest pain,
nausea, abdominal pain, or pain at her surgical site.

Imaging:

The patient is status post ORIF of a left proximal femur
fracture transfixed
by gamma nail and short intramedullary rod. On the current
images, the
proximal gamma nail tip extends through the femoral head
articular cortex,
across the joint space, into the acetabulum. There is increased
lucency about
the proximal tip of the gamma nail within the acetabulum,
suggesting bone loss
in the acetabulum. No displacement of the intramedullary portion
of the
hardware is identified. Aside from the
areas immediately about the hardware, the articular cortex
remains intact,
without resorption.

The femoral neck fracture line remains visible. Ununited greater
trochanteric
and lesser trochanteric fragments are present. There is some
surrounding
callus/heterotopic bone. Some of this density may also represent
bone debris
secondary to the hardware.

Of note, a 1 cm metallic density projects adjacent to the
proximal femur, new
compared with the preoperative film, ?surgical clip or displaced
metal
component. Some increased density in the surrounding soft
tissues is noted,
question of superimposition of shadows vs. localized hemorrhage

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] F w/ HTN, HLD s/p ORIF L-hip [**2151-12-28**] now s/p left
hemiarthroplasty repair with persistent hypoxia, intermittent
altered mental status, both resolved.

1. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS-  secondary to volume overload
given fluid repletion in OR and 4u PRBC and 1u FFP. Pt w/
evidence of volume overload on CXR and +2200cc from PACU. Pt has
no prior documentation of cardiac dysfunction in our system and
EF is unknown.  Patient tolerated gentle diuresis w/ 20mg IV
lasix. She was not hypercarbic so did not need BiPAP initiation.
 Weaned oxygen slowly over two days and patient had O2 sat of
93% on room air on day of discharge.
.
2. AMS- Patient at baseline is alert and oriented. Evaluated for
infectious etiology, cultures negative to date.  Once patient's
respiratory status improved, her mental status returned to
baseline.
.
3 ELEVATED TROPONIN- Troponin elevated at 0.06, MB not done,
this could be [**1-26**] elevated creatinine or demand ischemia from
hypoxia. EKG c/w RBBB w/ LAFB, new lateral ST changes w/ upward
sloping of ST segment in V4-V6.  CEs and MBs remained flat, ECG
changes resolved.  No evidence of infarct, likely due to demand
ischemia.
.
4 LEUKOCYTOSIS- Likely secondary to inflammation following
surgery. Evaluated for infectious etiology, cultures negative to
date.  Resolved.
.
5 ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY- [**Last Name (un) **] could be [**1-26**] ATN from hypotension as
pt was reported to be hypotensive to 80s on the floor. This
seems to respond to fluid boluses and currently has improved to
119.  Creatinine returned to baseline of 1.4 after diuretics
were held.  ACEi started prior to discharge, creatinine stable.
.
6 Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure- small LV on TTE.  Has history
of HTN.  BP improved, hematocrit stable.  Metoprolol tartrate
uptitrated to 50 TID.  Started lisinopril prior to discharge
without change in renal function.  Patient euvolemic at
discharge, no need for diuretics.  Will need periodic
monitoring, and if weight increases above 72 kg, patient will
need furosemide 40 mg PO daily until weight returns below 72 kg.

.
. GLAUCOMA- continued home eye drops
.
6. s/p HEMIARTHROPLASTY REPAIR- patient is weight bearing as
tolerated.  Will need three more weeks of Lovenox.  Follow up
appointment with orthopedic surgeon next week.  Will need
continued PT.
.
7. HTN- has hx HTN but has been hypotensive in house.  Home
antihypertensives held.
