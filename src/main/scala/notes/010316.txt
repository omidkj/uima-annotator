Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Renal failure, colitis, s/p colectomy/ostomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colectomy with end ileostomy

History of Present Illness:
In brief, patient is a 63 yo Cambodian male with h/o HTN, COPD,
past CVA who was transferred from an OSH after presenting with
left sided weakness on [**2179-6-11**], s/p AAA repair (5.5cm) on
[**2179-6-17**] c/b PNA, renal failure requiring intermittent HD,
colitis, and HIT.
.
Patient intially presented on [**2179-6-11**] with 10-15 minutes of
inability to move his left arm, which had happened previously.
He was ruled out for MI and stroke. He was seen by surgery and
had repair of a 5.5 cm juxto-renal AAA with aorto-bifemoral
bypass on [**2179-6-17**]. His post-op course was subsequently
complicated by acute renal failure, requiring multiple sessions
of HD with Tessio cath. He also developed necrotic/[**Last Name (un) **] gangrene
of toes b/l s/p surgery, no intervention was performed. He also
initially had persistent nausea, for which he was scoped from
above and below. He was started on TPN due to poor nutritonal
status. During the middle of his hospitalization, he developed
PNA (sputum + for enterobacter) and was treated with IV
antibiotics. He also developed loose stools and a distended
abdomen; stools were positive for c-diff and he was started on
po flagyl. Due to worsening abdominal symptoms and increasing
WBC from 16 to 36 since [**7-8**], he underwent a sigmoidoscopy on [**7-8**]
which demonstrated pseudomembranous plaques, c/w C diff. The
patient was then changed from po flagyl to IV flagyl and po
vanc. However, he did not respond to treatment, and his WBC
worsened and abdominal exam also worsened in terms of tenderness
and absence of bowel sounds; therefore, concern for ischemic
colitis was raised. He subsequently became more lethargic and
was transferred back to the ICU at the OSH and sent directly to
the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Options of colectomy
were raised at the OSH, however there was concern that the
patient would be too high-risk. His last HD was [**2179-7-7**] and was
stopped as patient was making approximately 1 L urine/day.

IMAGING:
CT ABD/PELV:
IMPRESSION:
1. Pancolitis, with markedly abnormal appearance of the entire
colon, with severe bowel wall thickening, and dilatation. Given
history of C. difficile infection, this appearance is most
concerning for toxic megacolon.
2. Small amount of ascites, and fluid tracking within the
abdominal mesentery.
3. Evidence of previous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with
aortobifemoral graft. Limited non-contrast evaluation is
unremarkable.
.
ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half
of the septum and anterior wall. The apex is mildly dyskinetic.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis of the
remaining segments. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. EF 30-35%.
IMPRESSION: Global and regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w
diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.)
.
ECG [**2179-7-20**]:
Sinus rhythm. Possible old inferior wall myocardial ischemia.
Poor R wave progression. Cannot rule out old anteroseptal
myocardial ischemia. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. No previous
tracings for comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
Renal Ultrasound
1. No downstream evidence of renal artery stenosis.
2. Echogenic renal cortex consistent with medical renal disease.
No hydronephrosis.
3. Small amount of fluid in [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo Cambodian male with h/o CAD, HTN, COPD, AAA s/p repair
complicated by ischemic ATN, HIT, pneumonia and C. diff colitis
with toxic megacolon, s/p colectomy with ileostomy.  His
hospital course is as follows:
.
Colitis s/p colectomy: Patient was initially transferred from
the OSH to the MICU for further management.  On arrival, the
patient appeared septic with a concerning abdominal exam.  CT
scan showed likely toxic-me
