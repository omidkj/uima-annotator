History of Present Illness:
84F with DM, CAD s/p IMI & PCI in [**2156**], PAF (not on coumadin due

pain per se.  The patient went to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].[**Name (NI) 10094**] office

had some shortness of breath that has been chronic.  She is able
to walk about 300-400 feet before having to stop.

On review of symptoms, the patient reports nocturia, but denies
palpitations, orthopnia, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnia, diarrhea,
rectal bleeding or hemoptysis.  She denies any pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 y.o woman with history of IMI s/p PCI to RCA in '[**56**], here
with unstable angina and dyspnea now s/p cardiac catherization
and evidence of 3 vessel disease.

#Coronary artery disease - the patient underwent cardiac
catherization that showed diffuse disease that was most amenable
to re-vascularization by CABG.  Cardiac surgery was consulted
and pre-operative carotid ultrasounds, transthoracic echo was
obtained.  The patient was maintained on IV heparin due to her
unstable angina and underwent CABG on [**2162-1-26**].  See operative
note for full details.  She was transferred to the intensive
care unit on neosynephrine and propofol in stable condition.
She was weaned from all vasoactive medication and extubated
without incident.  She was transferred to the step down unit.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per caridac surgery
protocol.  There was a small medial apical left pneumothorax
seen on chest xray after chest tubes were pulled, which was
stable at the time of discharge.  Her foley had to be reinserted
due to failure to void but the second attempt of removal was
successful.  Physical therapy continued to work with her to
increase strength and endurance.  On post operative day #6 she
was tolerating a full oral diet, her incisions were healing well
and she was ambulating with assistance.  She was felt safe for
discharge home with VNA services at this time.  The patient
remained in sinus rhythm throughout the hospital course with
brief bursts of a-fib post-operatively.  Per request of her
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], anti-coagulation with coumadin was
initiated.
