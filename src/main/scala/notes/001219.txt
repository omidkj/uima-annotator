Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Thoracentesis (multiple)
Chest Tube


History of Present Illness:
52 year old female with a history of lone atrial fibrillation
and Lyme meningitis presenting with progressive shortness of
breath over past 2 weeks. On [**5-23**], patient awoke with 10/10
pleuritic pain radiating down to left shoulder to left arm
associated with SOB and diaphoresis.  She went to PCP who
ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CTA which was negative for PE and diagnosed her with
pleurisy. She was prescribed motrin 800mg TID.
.
Her pain was mildy improved with the motrin but she developed
DOE which progressed to dyspnea at rest over the past 2 weeks.
Also endorsing chest heaviness, pleuritis left sided/LUQ pain,
orthopnea and PND. Her pain would be releived sitting forward.
Denies LE edema. 1 week ago she experienced 1 day of vomiting x5
episodes NBNB. In the past few days had fevers/chills and abd
distention associated with constipation and low grade headache.
TMax of 101.3. Also had dry cough. Saw PCP who took CXR which
showed pna with b/l pleural effusions.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 101 HR 120 BP 120/77 RR 18 Pox
89% RA. Resp distress. CXR L>R effusion and pericardial
effusion. Triggered in the ED for hypoxia to 89% RA, placed on
O2 by N/C + abx(CTX and lev), 2L bolus, followed by 150/hr.
Cards c/s: resolving pericardial effusion, decided not to tap.
Labs notable for ALT: 146 AP: 483 Tbili: 2.4 Alb: 3.3 WBC to 17
(no bands). Believe that pleural effusion may be bigger issue.
Had thoracentesis in ED 1200cc straw colored fluid. Prior to
transfer, 99.4, 110, 122/85, 20, 100% by N/C 5L.
.
Upon arriving to the ICU, patient was in [**10-31**] left sided
pleuritic chest pain. She felt SOB slightly improved. Pain worse
and different after thoracentesis. Also endorsed "contact"
dermatitis with couple blisters on lower extremities worse 2
weeks ago thought to be a nickel allergy. She has been drinking
POs well recently but appetite poor. Endorsed 1 year of
nightsweats which she believes are postmenopausal. Of note, she
missed her [**2173**] mammogram.

right bundeloid. ST, T changes are new since [**2-1**].
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: ([**2174-6-6**])
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion (1.3 cm
anteriorly and 1.8 cm around the right atrium). The effusion is
echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w organization. No right ventricular
diastolic collapse is seen. There is brief right atrial
diastolic invagination. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-3-9**],
the pericardial effusion is new. No overt tamponade is seen
however elevated intrapericardial pressure is suggested.
.
Echo: [**6-14**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The small pericardial effusion is echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements and appears
largely organized with minimal free fluid. The pericardium may
be thickened.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**6-8**]/201, the
pericardial effusion now appears slightly smaller

CXR [**6-6**]:  Extensive left pleural effusion, that
occupies approximately one-half of the left hemithorax. A small
right basal pleural effusion. Additional mild fluid markings of
the fissures and slight distention of the vasculature suggests
mild pulmonary edema. Subsequent areas of bilateral atelectasis.
The contour of the cardiac silhouette cannot be reliably
determined.
