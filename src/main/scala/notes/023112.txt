History of Present Illness:
77 y/o lady with CHF, AF, HTN was discharged from Trauma service
yesterday after she was admitted here with C7 fracure secondary
to fall.  She initially presented to an outside hospital prior
to the recent admission and was intubated for ? respiratory
distress vs glottic swelling.  Her course here was complicated
by unable to wean her off of vent and she eventually underwent a
trach/PEG placement on [**2194-1-10**].  Patient was discharged to
[**Hospital3 **].
.
Patient states that she has felt tired and sleepy in the last
two days.  Otherwise denies any symptoms.  Patient has had
episodes of tachycardia to 150s at rehab facility yesterday.
CXR this morning there was concerning for CHF.  She recieved 40
mg of furosemide IVP, cardizem 30 mg PGT (1444) and 1 mg of
ativan (1255).  Her BP dropped to 60s/40s.  She received some
fluid boluses.  Her vent setting there was ACMV PEEP 5, rate 12,
Volume 500 FiO2 40%. She was taken to [**Hospital6 **].
 She recieved 500 mg of levofloxacin.  She was transfered here
given recent hospitalization.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED her vitals were T 99.5  HR 79  BP 84/50  RR 18  100%
O2sat.  Patient received 1.5 L NS, 1 gram IV vancomycin and
started on 1 u PRBC.  Currently she is asymptomatic.
.
She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills,
nightsweats, abdominal pain, headache, acute change in vision,
hearing, new weakness, change in sensation.  No diarrhea,
constipation, hematuria, dysuria, or blood in stool.  She
occasionally feels nauseous.

RADIOLOGY:
[**2194-1-23**] CT C-SPINE: The alignment is normal. There is a
depressed fracture of the endplate of the C7 vertebra. There is
no significant canal stenosis at this level. There is a
posterior endplate fracture of the T2 vertebral body, without
significant canal stenosis at this level. There is again
multilevel degenerative disc and facet disease on the left at
C2-3.
There is scarring at the lung apex. The right pleural effusion
is again
noted. No significant canal stenosis at these levels. Multilevel
degenerative change is similar to prior.
IMPRESSION: No change in the appearances of C7 and T2 fractures.
No
significant new abnormality.
.
[**2194-1-22**] CXR:  In the interval the amount of hazy opacity
projecting over the right hemithorax with regions of lucency
within it has significantly increased causing obscuration of the
right hemidiaphragm. Mild blunting of the left costophrenic
angle persists. The pulmonary vasculature appears distinct
without any significant Kerley B lines noted. There is continued
opacity in the retrocardiac region. Right-sided PICC,
tracheostomy,
and calcifications within the aorta are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Increased effusions, moderate-to-large on right and
small-to-
moderate on left. Persistent adjacent opacities, probably
compressive
atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded within these
regions. No edema is noted.
.
[**2194-1-24**] CT HEAD:
CONCLUSION: No definite new intracranial abnormality. Bilateral
mastoid and
right middle ear abnormality, raising question of an ongoing
inflammatory
process, also involving the right sphenoid sinus air cell.

NOTE: Please note that the present study was obtained only with
a soft tissue
algorithm. Therefore, maximum bone detail was not depicted at
this time.

Finally, MR scanning of the brain, if feasible, offers far
greater sensitivity
in the detection of acute brain ischemia, compared with the
present CT scan
.
KUB [**2194-1-25**]:
FINDINGS: Unchanged position of the access line. No gastric or
intestinal
distention. Visible psoas opacity. Gas in the rectum. No
evidence of
pathological air-fluid levels.
.
CXR [**2194-1-28**]:
Since [**2194-1-25**], there is no overall change.

Tubes and catheters are in unchanged position, including a right
PICC ending
in the right brachiocephalic vein.

Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion, small left pleural
effusion and
moderate-to-large bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged. There are
no signs of
volume overload.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
EKG [**1-25**]:
Atrial fibrillation
Low limb lead QRS voltages
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition
Modest low amplitude lateral T wave changes
Findings are nonspecific
Since previous tracing of [**2194-1-22**], T wave abnormalities
decreased and Q-Tc
interval appears shorter
.
EKG [**1-22**]:
Atrial fibrillation. Low voltage in the standard leads.
Decreased R wave and T wave inversion in leads V2-V3. Occasional
ventricular premature beats. T wave inversion in leads V4-V6.
Consider anterior wall myocardial infarction of undetermined
age. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2194-1-17**], when there was
left and right arm lead reversal, the precordial T wave
inversions are new and may represent acute ischemia. In
addition, anterior voltage is decreased which may be related to
lead placement. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 y/o lady with CHF, AF, HTN was discharged from Trauma service
yesterday after she was admitted here with C7 fracure secondary
to fall now presents with hypotension.

# Hypotension:  Initial differential was that this was secondary
hypovolemia in the setting of aggressive diuresis and diastolic
heart failure vs. autonomic instability vs. medication effect.
Patient underwent an infectious work-up which revealed only MSSA
in sputum, presumed colonization given lack of fevers and
leukocytosis.  Patient was noted to have episodes of low
systolic BP's (high 60's), but BP improved after discontinuing
clonidine as there was no clear indication for her to be on this
medication.  She continues to have episodes of hypotension while
sleeping, but no changes in mentation.  She was started on Coreg
for management of her heart failure, which BP tolerated.
Midodrine administration was changed to 10 mg qHS.  Patient
should not return to
