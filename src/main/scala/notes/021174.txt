pulmonary intubation
Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
39 yo female history of HTN, IDDM, NiCMY with EF 45%,
nonobstructive CAD, and ESRD s/p HD today heard to release a
large yelp with an agonal breath and subsequently found to be
unresponsive and pulseless.  There are no strips from HD.  CPR
was initiated for three minutes until AED was applied and
advised shock with return of spontaneous circulation, a
perfusing rhythm, and 100% sat. EMS reports that she was
responsive only to painful stimuli, with a GCS of 6.  EKG at
that time was reported as NSR 70-80 withuot ectopy and
antiarrythmic deferred.  In the ED, she was found to have
gurgling breath sounds, poor tone, was not coherent and appeared
to be "out of it" so she was intubated with atomidate and
vecuronium.  She was started on 150mg IV amio bolus with drip at
1mg/minute.  She was sedated with propofol.  She was
hypertensive at 170's/100's, with multiple runs of PVC's
including 10 run beats of VT.  Her ectopy decreased with amio.
After head CT and guaiac were negative, a cooling protocol was
initiated with goal temp of 33.  A full strength rectal aspirin
was administered.  Blood gas upon admission was 7.43/49/108/34.
En route to the CCU, 2mg of Ativan were given for questionable
tongue twitching representing seizure activity.
.
Of note, recently seen at [**Hospital1 2177**] for febrile viral illness for
which she was given doses of vanco, levo, and flagyl.  Her
potassium at that time was listed as 4.1.  EKG at that time was
noted to be NSR at 75, with multiple PVC's and no acute ST-T
changes.
.
In the CCU, she is unable to complete a review of systems or
voice her complaints as she is intubated.

Blood Cultures x 2 [**12-3**]: No Growth

IMAGING/STUDIES:
.
CXR [**12-3**]:
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in position.
Bilateral
pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. Left base opacity
may represent combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion,
although underlying consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.
.
CT Head [**12-3**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
TTE [**12-4**]:
.
CXR Portable [**12-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Tip of left IJL abuts wall of the upper SVC.
2. Worsening mild to moderate congestive heart failure.
.
EEG [**12-5**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG study since
the
background was disorganized and slightly slow consistent with a
mild
diffuse encephalopathy of non-specific etiology. Superimposed
frontally
predominant delta activity was seen with stimulation during
bedside care
and likely represents a pattern of arousal. No epileptiform
discharges
or electrographic seizures were recorded. This EEG show a
significant
improvement compared to previous day's recording as background
frequency
is faster at 7.5 Hz (compared to 5 Hz on the previous day) and
some
normal sleep morphologies were also noted.
.
Chest Portable [**12-5**]:
There is new almost complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
There is no
pneumothorax. Small right and moderate left pleural effusions
are unchanged. Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left
side. Left IJ catheter tip is in the upper to mid SVC.
.
EEG [**12-6**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG study.
