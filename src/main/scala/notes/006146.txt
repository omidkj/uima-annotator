Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital
intubated to the trauma ICU.  Initially his exam was poor, but
off of sedation on hospital day one he was arousable, opened his
eyes and followed commands with all four extremities.  He was
extubated subsequent to this, and transferred to the
neurosurgery stepdown on [**11-26**]. His head CT was repeated, and
determined to be stable. His mental status continued to wax and
wane, consistant with his history of dementia. She continued to
remain neurologically stable, and was transferred from the
stepdown until to the NSURG floor.  He was restarted on his
aspirin and sub-q heparin. He was determined to be safe to
resume his coumadin on [**12-7**](to be monitored by his PCP/vs
Cardiologist). On [**11-27**], he had a one-time low grade fever,
cultures of urine, chest x-ray, and LE ultrasounds were
performed(all determined to be negative).  He continued to be
seen and evaluated by PT/OT who recommended dispoisition to a
