Pt was in USOH until 7pm [**2124-2-5**], when pt felt acutely SOB at
rehab, was found to be in afib with RVR rate 156. No chest pain,
no palpitations, no dizziness, no lightheadedness. no fevers, no
chills, + SOB, but no cough, no sputum production reported. Pt
was given morphiine lasix, NTG, morphine and O2 and xferred to

on neosynepherine. BNP > 5000. Rate controlled with IV
diltiazem, but remained neo dependent, on bipap, O2 sats 98%. Pt
left [**Hospital3 **] 2301 with BP 102/55, HR 88, RR 26 on BIPAP,
medfligted to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Interestingly enough, first transfer was

EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response. ST
segment
elevations in leads VI-V3 up to four millimeters raising concern
of acute
evolving anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Possible prior
inferior wall
myocardial infarction. Intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular
hypertrophy. Inferolateral non-specific ST-T wave changes. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2124-2-6**] at 14:05 hours
and is compared with the prior radiograph performed the same
morning at 08:40 hours. Allowing for technical changes, there is
likely no significant change in the appearances previously
described with bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities,
more marked on the right side and consistent with asymmetric
edema or fluid overload. Tubes and lines are unchanged.
Left-sided pleural effusion unchanged.
.
AP UPRIGHT CHEST: The patient is status post median sternotomy
and CABG. The tip of a right subclavian dual lumen central
venous catheter terminates in the mid right atrium. The heart
size is top normal. The vascular pedicle width is increased well
as the caliber of the pulmonary vasculature. There is perihilar
haziness as well as patchy aveolar opacities consistent with
moderate interstitial pulmonary edema. Slightly more confluent
opacities are present in the right infrahilar region. No
pneumothorax is identified. A small left pleural effusion is
likely
IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary interstitial edema. More
confluent right infrahilar opacity may be due to dependent edema
or a superimposed process such as acute aspiration.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
basal half of the inferior wall and distal anterior wall and
apex. The remaining segments contract well. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
c/w
multivessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Left ventricular
diastolic
dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
#) Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  Beta
blocker increased for rate control.  Patient restarted on
coumadin and is therapeutic.  Rate has been well controlled on
current regimen.
.
#) Pneumonia:  Patient had a fever in the setting of hypoxia and
cough.  He was started on levofloxacin/vancomycin and has
defervesced.  Plan for a total 7 day treatment course.  He is up
to date on his vaccinations and is now stable o
