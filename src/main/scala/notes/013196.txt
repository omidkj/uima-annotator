his hepatitis C with interferon. He has had progressive
worsening of dyspnea on exertion and  progressive hoarseness.
Rigid bronchoscopy revealed a proximal tracheal stenosis in the
A-frame shape suggestive of
a stomal injury.

trach/open J-tube placement, cirrhosis

Ext: + pulses
Inc:CDI

Pertinent Results:
[**2129-5-9**] cardiac echo: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed with mild global
hypokinesis more
prominent in the mid to distal antero-lateral wall. There is no
ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.


CXR [**2129-5-24**]:
IMPRESSION: Slowly improving bilateral interstitial opacities,
which may be due to resolving pulmonary edema, infection or
hemorrhage. Continued followup is recommended to exclude a more
chronic interstitial abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
pt was admitted w/ tracheal stenosis and  bronchoscopy to
identify extent of lesion. The bronchoscopy was complicated by
flash pul edema requiring intubation and SICU admission. Pt was
diuresed and extubated to BIPAP on PPD#1/HD# 3.
ON HD# 5 pt was started on vanco/levo for persistant
leukocytosis and sputum w/ GM+ cocci. Transferred from ICU to
floor to await tracheal surgery.
On HD#7 pt had bronchoscopy which showed stable stenosis.
On HD# 13 pt was taken to the OR for tracheal resection and
reconstruction. guardian stitch placed in OR to amintain neck
flexion and to decrease tension on anastomosis.
Post operatively pt was admitted to the SICU for airway
management. APS was following for pain management. Extubated on
POD#1. POD#3 pt transferred from ICU to floor for ongoing post
op management. POD#[**5-13**] [**Last Name (un) **] reg diet and ambulating. Epidural
d/c'd and mainatined on PCA. Bronch on POD#7-----------guardian
stitch cut.
Patient d/c'd home with f/u appintment.
