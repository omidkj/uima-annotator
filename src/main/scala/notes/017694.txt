Substernal chest pain

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20858**] is a 67 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, multiple stents
and PCIs, HTN who presented to [**Hospital6 33**] with SSCP
radiating to both arms during the Superbowl. He was sitting and
watching TV when he developed sharp [**9-22**] SSCP in a bandlike
distribution that spanned both the right and left sides of his
chest. He had similar symptoms 2 weeks ago and was transferred
from [**Hospital1 34**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath, but that was not performed for
unclear reasons. His pain initially was non radiating, but then
progressed to involve both his arms. He notes being nauseous and
sweaty and vomited in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He notes that he has had
this similar pain for many years and is similar to episodes in
the past when he has had MIs; he reports that this episode may
have been more severe. At home, he took 3 SL NTGs without relief
and called EMS. The EMTs provided additional nitroglycerin with
minimal relief. At [**Hospital1 34**], he was given nitroglycerin, heparin and
plavix loaded and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Apparently, his pain was
relieved only with dilaudid.
.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he was continued on nitro gtt and heparin
gtt, and was chest pain free. He was 99% on a NRB on admission
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He was given 40mg IV lasix x 1 for potential
pulmonary edema.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, or rigors, but
did admit to chills yesterday. He denied heartburn (initially
also took maalox without relief).
.
He also noted SOB that was not changed from his baseline SOB. He
notes that he is SOB with minimal exertion - his ADLs cause him
to be SOB. He can still climb a flight of stairs, but becomes
SOB with this. 1 month ago, he was able to walk [**12-16**] mile per
day, but is no longer able to do so. His LE swelling is
unchanged, and 2 pillow orthopnea is baseline for him. He denied
medication noncompliance or dietary indiscretion. Denied
palpitations.

[**2119-1-16**] TTE:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with [**Month/Day/Year 39407**] of the basal
to mid inferior and inferolateral segments. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Reduced
ejection fraction - intrinsic LV function is likely more
depressed given the severity of regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20858**] was admitted with chest pain and found to have an
NSTEMI.  He has known CAD with graft disease, but had
post-radiation skin changes from prior interventions and,
therefore, was not a candiate for invasive intervention this
hospitalization.  He was placed on heparin for 48 hours after
admission as well as a nitroglycerin drip for relief of the
chest pain.  Echocardiogram showed a decreased ejection fraction
(40-50%) with 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 39407**] of basal and inferolateral
segments.  He was continued on plavix, aspirin, lipitor (dose
increased from 40 mg to 80 mg), ramipril (dose changed from 5 mg
TID to 20 mg QD), metoprolol (dose increased from 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] to
100 mg TID), amlodipine and imdur (once the NG was
discontinued).  He was also started on HCTZ.  Of note, he had a
transient leukocytosis on admission, thought to be a stress
response to the MI and not infectious in nature; it resolved by
the time of discharge.

His hospital course was complicated by shortness of breath on
exertion and relative hypoxia with ambulatory sats 88-89% on
room air even after aggressive diuresis with IV Lasix.  His
oxygen saturation inproved with 2 L NC supplementation, and he
was discharged with home oxygen.  He was sent home on lasix 40
mg QD to maintain an even fluid balance.  He was also sent home
with pulmonary follow-up for care of his COPD (he is not
currently on any medicines for his lung disease and has not had
PFT's).
