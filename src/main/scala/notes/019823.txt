[**2176-9-22**] Chest XRAY
HISTORY: Acute exacerbation of CHF, question pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2176-1-13**]:
Moderate cardiomegaly has increased. There is a suggestion of
minimal
interstitial pulmonary edema accompanying a new small left
pleural effusion. Pulmonary vasculature is not particularly
engorged. There is no focal pulmonary abnormality

[**2176-9-27**] Renal Ultrasound CONCLUSION: Small atrophic right
kidney, particularly in the upper pole abnormal intraparenchymal
waveforms, but no evidence of increased velocities at the level
of the aorta and right renal artery stent. Normal waveforms both
in the proximal left renal artery near the stent and in the more
peripheral intraparenchymal renal arteries on the left side.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 59 year old man with a history of CHF (EF 15%). He
presented for transfer from an OSH in acute on chronic renal
failure. After improvement of his creatinine, he underwent
cardiac catheterization on [**9-26**]. Following the procedure he was
observed in the CCU out of concern for embolization causing
mesenteric ischemia. Following the catheterization his
creatinine steadily increased.
.
# CAD: Patient has a history of CAD s/p stenting. We continued
him on aspirin, plavix, and beta-blocker. His lipid panel was:
chol 257 trigl 222 HDL 30 LDL 183. We started him on low dose
pravastatin because of previous intolerance to lipitor (leg
muscle pain). He tolerated it well. He underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**9-26**]. It showed the one vessel CAD and
elevated Left sided filling pressures.
.
.
# CHF - Patient had an EF of 15% on recent echo with severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. We held his ACE inhibitor
in the setting of his acute renal failure and report of previous
hyperkalemia on an ACE inhibitor (with worsening renal
function).  He was discharged on 40mg of lasix PO daily, which
was his original dose prior to admission to the OSH.
.
# HTN - The patient had a hypotensive episode at the OSH after
receiving BP meds. He was initially given carvedilol 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
which was uptitrated to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He was started on hydralazine
for better control post-cath.  he was also started on Imdur 30mg
daily as well.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient presented with low
urine output and increasing creatinine. We did not diuresis him
any further, but allowed him to eat and drink. His creatinine
slowly improved over time. After cath, his creatinine again
rose.  It was stable between 3.1-3.3 post cath.  The patient was
set up with an outpatient nephrology appointment.
.
# Diabetes: The patient's chart noted a history of diabetes.
However, he denied ever being told this. His A1C was 5.9%. He
did not require regular fingersticks.
.
PROPHYLAXIS: Patient received subcutaneous heparin.
.
