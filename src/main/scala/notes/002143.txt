Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21114**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement, PICC placement, Intubation, NG
tube, Lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
(History per patient's domestic partner and HCP): 51 y.o. male
with HIV (CD4 of 559 and VL undetectable in [**Month (only) 547**]), ESRD [**1-7**] IgA
nephropathy s/p DDRT in '[**14**], DM, CAD who initially presented to
an OSH with a chief complaint of SOB. Patient was recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] with presumed CAP after extensive work-up
was otherwise negative for TB (by AFB and Quanteferon Gold) and
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was initially treated with Levofloxacin, followed by
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin, then finally Cefpodoxime for 7
days on discharge to complete a total of 2 weeks of antibiotics.
He returned home and was in his normal state of health until
approximately 3 days ago when he began experiencing shortness of
breath and a cough, intermittently productive of clear sputum.
Reportedly, he had no F/C, N/V during this time. He has chronic
diarrhea in the setting of HAART. On the day of admission,
patient woke up feeling profoundly short of breath and also
complaining of neck pain and stiffness without headache. His
partner then notes that he vomited a very large amount of brown
emesis with no blood. Approximately 2 hours later, the patient
was lightheaded and unsteady on his feet and his partner, a
dialysis tech, took his blood pressure and recorded an SBP of
70. Temperature was also noted to be elevated to 102. EMS was
then notified and patient was taken to [**Hospital6 5016**].
.
At [**Hospital3 **], patient continued to be hypotensive in the 70s
and hypoxic to 86% on RA. He was given 3 L NS and a CXR was
ordered, which showed a RLL infiltrate. He was then given
Levofloxacin and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient was noted to be hypotensive to SBP 72
and relatively hypoxic with O2 sat of 93% on 4L NC. A repeat CXR
showed a right lung infiltrate and a probable effusion on the
left. Given continued O2 requirement and hypotension, patient
was intubated and started on Levophed then subsequently admitted
to the MICU for further management.

Pertinent Results:
[**2119-5-29**] CXR Portable: Mild pulmonary edema has resolved. There
is linear atelectasis in the right mid and lower lung zones.
There are no pleural effusions. Appropriate position of
right-sided PICC line with tip in the mid SVC.
.
[**2119-5-25**] CXR Portable: Increasing mild pulmonary edema. Improving
left basilar atelectasis.
.
[**2119-5-24**] Echo:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2119-5-24**] CXR Portable: The right middle lobe consolidation,
stable since the [**2119-5-23**] examination, has clearly improved
since the [**2119-5-18**] examination. The left lower lobe opacity
has worsened. The small left pleural effusion is stable. There
is no right pleural effusion. The endotracheal tube is 2 cm from
the carina. The right internal jugular line tip is at the
caval/brachiocephalic junction.
.
[**2119-5-23**] CXR Portable: Mild pulmonary edema is noted demonstrated
by increased prominence of peripheral septal lines. Component of
right middle lobe opacity has improved with minimal improvement
of left lower lobe opacity. Moderate left pleural effusion and
associated atelectasis remain. The upper lungs remain clear. No
appreciable right pleural effusion is noted.
.
[**2119-5-21**] CXR Portable: Comparison is made with prior chest x-ray
of [**5-20**]. A perihilar edema persists, left hemidiaphragm
remains obscured indicating collapse consolidation in the left
lower lobe and the right heart border is also obscured
indicating a right lower lobe infiltrate.
.
[**2119-5-20**] Abdomen Portable:
.
[**2119-5-17**] CT head w/o contrast: There is no hemorrhage, edema,
mass, mass effect, or evidence of acute vascular territorial
infarction. Ventricles and sulci are unchanged in size and
configuration. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted on
the carotid siphons and vertebral arteries. Left phthisis bulbi
is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. No change from
[**2119-4-19**].

[**2119-5-17**] CXR Portable: 1. Right IJ catheter terminating in the
contralateral brachiocephalic vein and directed laterally. 2.
Interstitial edema with more focal right middle lobe opacity may
reflect either "atypical" edema or pneumonia.
