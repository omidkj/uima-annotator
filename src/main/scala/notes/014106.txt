Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
58 yo M w hx of COPD (FEV1 24% predicted, 4 L home oxygen),
diastolic CHF, presents with two days of increasing DOE and
weakness and fatigue.

Patient's daughter (also [**Name (NI) **]) first called [**Name (NI) 191**] and then elected
to bring patient to [**Hospital3 **] ED. She reported that the patient
had 2 days of generalized body aches, fatigue, HA, increased SOB
(above baseline), low back pain (per OMR is chronic). No cough
or fever.

At presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED vitals were: T 98.4, HR 120, BP
146/80, RR 30, O2Sat 96% (10 L neb). CXR was obtained. Patient
was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Received several
rounds of albuterol and ipratropium as well as methylpred 125 mg
IV. Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza rule-out was reportedly
sent from ED and patient was started on oseltamivir. An ABG was
performed and was 7.16/125/120 (was sent under wrong patient's
name). Patient was subsequently started on BiPAP. Patient
subsequently became more somnolent and repeat ABG showed
7.21/116/70. Due to somnolence, head CT was performed and prelim
negative. Patient subsequently intubated and started on fentanyl
and midazolam drips. Vitals prior to transfer to the ICU were:
HR 107, BP 122/83, RR 14, O2Sat 98% (CMV, VT 400, RR 14, FiO2
60%, PEEP 7).

Past Medical History:
1) COPD, largely emphysema (FEV1/FVC 29, FEV1 24% pred [**6-/2113**])
- s/p bullectomy with RUL resection in [**2106**]
- 4L of oxygen at baseline
2) Colonic polyps
3) History of embolic stroke which had hemorrhagic conversion
s/p heparin [**2110-7-22**] (frontal and occipital)
4) History of PFO
5) Factor V Leiden heterozygosity
6) Hyperlipidemia
7) Inguinal hernia
8) Right ventricular dysfunction, likely due to pulmonary
hypertension
9) Polycythemia, likely due to hypoxemia
10) Eczema

Worked as a security guard (vs computer scientist) at [**University/College **]
library. Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 3307**] and uses wheelchair to get
around outside of the home. Also has grown children.

resection. He has at least a 40-pack year history.

VT 400, RR 14, PEEP 7, FiO2 60%)
GEN: NAD
HEENT: PERRL, does not track movement, oral mucosa moist,
NECK: No [**Doctor First Name **], no JVP elevation
PULM: Coarse, but diminished breath sounds with crackles and
left anterior base, prolonged expiratory phase with inaudible
air movement in expiratory, copious thick secretions suctioned
from ET tube
CARD: RR, nl S1, nl S2, no M/R/G
ABD: BS+, soft, non-tender, non-distended
EXT: No C/C/E

Studies:

[**2113-11-10**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Intraventricular conduction
delay. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2110-8-10**] the rate has
increased and intraventricular conduction delay is now present.

[**2113-11-10**] Chest xray: 1. Findings consistent with pulmonary edema.
2. Emphysematous changes and post-surgical changes in the right
upper lung.

[**2113-11-11**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
New hypodensities seen in the current study can be due to
evolution of infarcts but an associated acute infarct is
difficult to evaluate. MRI can help for further assessment if
clinically indicated.

[**2113-11-15**] Chest xray: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change. The patient has been extubated, the
nasogastric tube has been removed. Pre-existing bilateral
opacities are unchanged in extent and
severity. The size of the cardiac silhouette, at least its
visible parts, are also unchanged. The caudal parts of the left
sinus are not included on the image. The presence of a small
left-sided pleural effusion cannot be
excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo M w hx of COPD (FEV1 24% predicted), diastolic CHF,
presents with two days of increasing DOE and weakness and
fatigue.

#. Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  He was intubated in the
emergency room due to hypercarbic respiratory failure with a
pCO2 greater than 100.  He was felt to have a COPD exacerbation
in setting of a likely community acquired pneumonia. His last
measured FEV1 was 24% predicted.  Though he had no history of
fevers, cough, or chills, his elevated WBC count to 11.8 with
81% neutrophils as well as CXR findings of patchy opacities
consistent with a pneumonia. He was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin on [**11-11**], and completed his course of azithromycin.
Ceftriaxone course will end on [**2113-11-17**].  He was also given
Albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments, in addition to
being started on IV steroids.  He had a negative swab for
influenza. His respiratory status improved and he was extubated
on [**2113-11-14**].  Though he continued to have periodic desaturations
to the high 80s, he remained stable on face tent.  He was also
put on a prednisone taper which should be continued after
discharge.  Prednisone taper can be adjusted per according to
patient's clinical presentation (i.e. stop taper and continue
steroids if respiratory status worsens). At discharge, he was on
face tent with Fi02 55% with O2 sats 89-92%.  He desats when
eating as he takes off his oxygen.  Patient needs repeat CXR at
6 weeks to ensure that bilateral lower lobe opacities seen on
imaging this admission resolve.  If these imaging abnormalities
are not resolved on repeat CXR, he will need high resolution
chest CT to further evaluate his lung parenchema.

#. Coagulopathy: He had elevation of his INR to 5.8 at
admission. he had no evidence of GI bleeding and no history of
trauma to cause concern for internal bleeding. Negative head CT
for bleed in the ED was reassuring.  Hct remained stable and his
Coumadin was restarted at his home dose prior to discharge.  He
is reportedly on Coumadin for a h/o CVA and factor V Leiden
heterozygosity.  He will need INR checks after discharge and his
dose may need to be readjusted.  Goal INR is [**1-10**].

#. Hyperlipidemia: Continued on simvastatin.

#. Diastolic heart failure:  He was given IV fluids on admission
and during his stay for hypotension.  He was then aggressively
diuresed as his chest xrays looked like pulmonary edema.  He was
restarted on his home Lasix at discharge, and would likely
benefit from an In/Out goal of 1 liter negative per day after
discharge as his breathing continues to improve.

#. Chest Pain: He had one episode of chest pain during this
admission and there was low clinical suspicion for a cardiac
source.  His ECG was unchanged and he was ruled out for MI.

#. Code Status: He was full code during
