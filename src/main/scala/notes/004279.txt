HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old male with
Stage 2A esophageal cancer status post chemo and radiation
treatment. Also of note, this patient has myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]
status post thymectomy and apheresis, transient ischemic
attack in the past, silent myocardial infarction in [**2092**],
hematuria and rosacea. The patient is admitted at this time
for planned laparoscopic and thoracoscopic
esophagogastrectomy to be performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 952**]. Mr. [**Known lastname 4427**] has a history of developing regurgitation
that began in [**2101-7-31**] that was associated with
dysphagia without odynophagia and in addition, lost 15 lb.
over the months following [**2101-7-31**]. He had a barium
swallow which showed a 3 cm polypoid mass in the distal
esophagus. Biopsy and esophagoscopy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15908**]
confirmed esophageal carcinoma. An infiltrative, fungated and
partially obstructing nonbleeding 5 cm mass was seen at the
lower third of the esophagus. On endoscopic ultrasound, it
extended through the muscularis propriate consistent with a
T3 lesion. No other areas were PET positive.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, weight was 206 lb.,
pulse 81, blood pressure 134/81, temperature 97.5 degrees F.,
O2 saturation 97 percent with a respiratory rate of 14
breaths per minute. Generally, this was a well-appearing male
in no acute distress. Oropharynx was moist and clear with no
mucositis or thrush. Sclerae were anicteric. Extraocular
motions were intact. Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy
cervically or supraclavicularly and there was no
infraclavicular lymphadenopathy as well. The heart was in
regular rate and rhythm. There were no murmurs, rubs or
gallops. Back showed no spinal or costovertebral angle
tenderness. Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, protuberant, obese with
normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities revealed no clubbing or
edema. Skin revealed minimal bilateral nasal rosacea, a well-
healed mid sternal scar, minimal erythema on the back from
radiation skin changes and a port site that was clean, dry
and intact with no erythema and was nontender.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, at this time, the patient was
admitted for further treatment and evaluation at the [**Hospital1 1444**] in the form of a
laparoscopic/thorascopic esophagogastrectomy and on [**2-8**], the patient was brought to the operating room after having
been fully preoperatively evaluated where the patient
underwent laparoscopic/thorascopic esophagogastrectomy
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The patient
received 5.8 liters of crystalloid fluid in the operating
room and there was a blood loss of an estimated 200 ml during
the operation. In the immediate postoperative period, the
patient was brought to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit after
also having received 750 ml of albumin, 500 mcg of fentanyl
and 7 mg of vecuronium. He was extubated shortly after the
operation on the afternoon of [**2102-2-8**] and was
complaining of only peri-incisional pain and tenderness near
the right posterior back incision. He stated that he was not
short of breath at this time and did not feel weak and did
not feel he was having any diplopia. On postoperative day 1,
the patient required a bolus of 500 cc of Lactated Ringers
for mean arterial pressure near 65 and an elevated lactate,
responded well to this and the patient was continued on
maintenance level IV fluids. The patient was briefly out of
bed during this time. The patient was also followed by the
Neuromuscular Service and their plan was to commence Mestinon
and CellCept for his myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] in that if the patient
began suffering increasing weakness or worsening respiratory
status, to call Neurology at once and not to increase the
Mestinon and to consider possibly plasmapheresis. The patient
was on a planned six doses of Kefzol and Flagyl during this
time. The patient was also seen by the Nutrition Service on
postoperative day 1 and suggested jejunal tube feeds
progressing from half to three-quarter strength. On
postoperative day 1, in the evening, the patient seemed to be
developing fatigability and respiratory issues and was shown
to have some aspect of congestive heart failure on a chest x-
ray. The Neurology Service was consulted at once and
suggested that the vital capacity and negative inspiratory
force be checked every 2 hours and that the patient may need
intubation and diuresis. The patient was having a significant
oxygen requirement at this time and was also complaining of
shortness of breath. He did receive Lasix 10 mg IV times two
overnight and was on a nonrebreather mask with an FIO2 of 100
percent. His urine output was noted to briskly increase after
both doses of Lasix with some improvement in symptoms and
exam. Trophic tube feeds were also started at this time. His
central venous line was also removed during this time. On
[**2102-2-10**], postoperative day 2, the patient received
a bronchoscopy and there was noted to be multiple plugs of
mucus in the lower lobes, right greater than left. These were
removed. The patient required intubation as well on the
second postoperative day due to increased oxygen requirement
and fatigability. On postoperative day 3, the patient was
noted to be febrile and somewhat hypotensive with blood
pressure into the low 100s and high 90s on occasion. The
patient was pancultured at this time, was continued on fluids
and vancomycin and Zosyn were started empirically. A Tensilon
test during this time was noted to be negative. The patient
was bronchoscoped again on [**2102-2-11**] and noted to
again have nonpurulent heme secretions, but that it was noted
to be a much improved exam from [**2-10**], the previous
day. On postoperative day 4, the patient was noted to have
had episodes over the last 24 hours of hypotension, again
requiring fluid boluses with fever to 102 degrees. He was
recultured at this time. The patient at this time also had
bilateral chest tubes with the left putting out copious
drainage and the patient was also transfused with 1 unit of
packed red blood cells at this time. The patient was again
continued to be diuresed at this time with goal 1 [**1-1**] to 2
liters negative.  On postoperative day 5, the patient
underwent a Cortrosyn stimulation test that was normal and
then on Monday, [**2102-2-13**], a percutaneous
tracheostomy was performed as the patient was appearing to
require the vent for a significantly longer period of time at
this point. This was done under bronchoscopic guidance. There
were no complications to the procedure and the tracheostomy
was placed carefully and safely. Tube feeds were at goal at
this point and the goal continued to be to wean the
ventilator if possible. The patient was started on physical
therapy at this point and was consistently out of bed to the
chair during this time. On postoperative day 7, his right
jugular venous line was changed for fevers and he was noted
to be tolerating a pressure support wean fairly well and was
down to pressures [**4-4**] and PEEP of 5 at 50 percent for 4
hours. On [**2102-2-15**], the patient had received
bronchoscopy again and the patient tolerated this well. There
were noted to be copious secretions with mucus plugging and a
therapeutic aspiration was performed especially in the right
lower lobe. The patient received another transfusion of 1
unit of packed red blood cells at this time for a hematocrit
of 28.7. His aspirin was restarted at this point and the
patient was out of bed and continued to exercise with
Physical Therapy. On [**2-16**], postoperative day 8, on
chest x-ray, it appeared the patient had a right sided
pneumonia. Vancomycin and Zosyn were continued and the goal
at this point was to establish a trach mask. The patient had
not had a bowel movement and a Fleet enema was instituted.
The patient was ambula
