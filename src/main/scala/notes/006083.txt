Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7744**]
Chief Complaint:
cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
24 yo obese male with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%) p/w SOB
and blood tinged sputum. On Friday he presented to the ED with 5
days of SOB that was worse when he laid down at night. He was
afebrile with 02sat 100% but was tachycardic to 120 and
tachypneic to 32. CXR is difficult to interpret but shows
cardiomegaly with questionable pneumonia. CTA shows multifocal
PNA. He was given levofloxacin and transferred to the MICU for
treatment of penumonia.
.
In the MICU he was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin,
never intubated, never concern for sepsis or needing
vasopressors, improved O2 sats over 2 days. He had persistent
tachycardia which was treated with fluid resuscitation, PE ruled
out with negative CTA. Had 30 beat run of vtach at rate lower
than threshold for ICD that resolved on its own.

Past Medical History:
1. Presumed Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
- diagnosed [**11-27**] when he presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with cough, fever,
and increasing SOB. Chest CT showed bilateral lung infiltrates
and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes consistent with multifocal
pneumonia, and echocardiography showed moderate to severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30%), with
normal valve function, and no pericardial effusion. Lab work
for RSV was positive, while HIV, influenza, EBV, CMV, Lyme and
multiple blood cultures were unremarkable.
- last ECHO on [**2193-3-13**] showed severely dilated LV cavity with
severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25%).
2. Childhood asthma
3. Morbid obesity
4. Sleep apnea - on CPAP but has not been using it
5. Moderate pulmonary hypertension
6. Fatty Liver by CT. Obese and hx of EtOH. INR 1.4-1.7 since
[**5-29**]; Bili 1.7; HCV neg; HBV immune.

MICRO:
[**2193-9-27**] Blood Cx: negative
[**2193-9-28**] Sputum: multiple organisms c/w oropharyngeal flora
[**2193-9-28**] Urine: no legionella
.
IMAGING:
[**2193-9-27**] Portable CXR:
1. Persistent massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette,
likely relating to patient's known cardiomyopathy, although
underlying pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
2. Right base opacity raises concern for pneumonia.
3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary
edema, left base not well evaluated. Subtle overlying opacity
may relate to overlying soft tissues, although an atelectasis or
consolidation cannot be excluded.
.
[**2193-9-27**] CTA Chest:
1. Findings compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3. Cardiomegaly with evidence of right heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo man with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%) p/w
SOB, blood tinged sputum. Found to be tachycardic and tachypneic
in the ED. CTA chest neg for PE, and c/w multifocal pneumonia.
Brief hospital course by problem:
.
# Multifocal Community Acquired Pneumonia: Pt was given one dose
of levofloxacin in the ED, and then ceftriaxone and azithromycin
in the MICU. Urinary legionella antigen was negative. Blood
cultures negative. Upon transfer to the floor he was weaned off
oxygen with good O2 sats on room air (mid-upper 90s when
ambulating). He was afebrile with WBC trending down.
Azithromycin was continued for a 5-day course. Ceftriaxone was
discontinued and cefpodoxime was started for a total 10-day
course.
.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Two days after admission Cr increased
from 1.1 (baseline ~1.2) to 1.8, and then decreased to 1.3 upon
discharge. Possibly secondary to CTA contrast which was
performed on day of admission. Recommend f/u by PCP.
.
# Systolic CHF: Pt appeared volume overloaded on admission
considering LE edema. Difficult to assess JVP given obese neck.
BNP was 3837. Metoprolol was continued but digoxin, diovan,
eplerenone, and torsemide were held due to [**Last Name (un) **]. Eplerenone and
diovan were later restarted, however digoxin and torsemide were
held upon discharge. The pt will have labs checked the day
following discharge with close f/u by PCP.
.
# Sleep Apnea: Encouraged patient to use bipap machine on home
settings while in hospital and at home after discharge.
.
# Thyroid Nodule: Found incidentally on CTA chest. Recommend f/u
by PCP.
.
# Elevated PT: PT is elevated at 15.9, consistent with past
elevations. Recommend f/u by PCP.
.
# Fatty liver: ALT was lightly elevated at 41, and total
bilirubin was elevated at 1.6, consistent with past elevations.
Recommend f/u by PCP.
