CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW:

The heart is not enlarged for technique. A femoral approach IABP
is present, with radiopaque tip lying along the inferior edge of
the aortic knob. Two very small radiopaque markers are
superimposed over the spine, one to the left of the T6 vertebral
body and one overlying the L3-4 disc space. These are of unknown
etiology or significance to me, but are new compared with film
from earlier the same day. Also new compared with earlier the
same day is a faint alveolar opacity superimposed over both
lungs. This most likely represents dependent atelectasis, given
its rapid evolution and absence of upper zone redistribution or
effusions. However, attention to this finding on follow-up films
is recommended to exclude a superimposed pulmonary process.

EKG: Sinus rate of 96. QRS changes V3/V4 - probably due to LVH
but consider anterior infarct Hyperacute T waves in leads V4,V5
consider acute anterior current of
injury/myocardial infarction

Cardiac Cath:
:
  1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right-dominant
system
with severe single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA,
LCX, and
RCA had no angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenoses. The
LAD had
a 100% occlusion in the mid vessel.
  2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal elevated right
sided
pressures (RV 41/13 mmHg), and elevated left sided pressures
(LVEDP 28,
mean PCWP 28 mmHg) with no gradient upon movement of the
catheter from
the ventricle back to the aorta. The cardiac index was mildly
low (2.5
l/min/m2).
  3. Left ventriculography showed severe anterior hypokinesis
and
inferoapical dyskinesis (EF 30%) with severe mitral
regurgitation.
  4. Acute anterior STEMI treated with primary PCA and stenting
with two
overlapping Cypher DESs (2.5x28mm and 2.5x23mm deployed at 16
atms). The
stents were postdilated with a 3.5x33 mm Highsail baloon at 16
atms (See
PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe mitral regurgitation.
3. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.

ECHO:
Views of left ventricular function were limited. There appeared
to be at least
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the
lateral apex. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion

Relook cardiac cath:
1. Resting hemodynamics demosntrated mildly elevated right and
left-sided filling pressures with a preserved cardiac output.
  2. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated no significant
coronary
artery disease.  The LMCA and LCX were angiographically normal.
The LAD
stents were widely patent without residual stenoses.  However,
there was
a pulsatile flow pattern in the LAD with slowed flow and delayed

initiation of myocardial blush.  The RCA was a small vessel that

exhibited cathter-damping, but there was no angiographically
apparent
coronary artery disease.
  3. The left femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a 6
French
Angioseal device


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: This patient had a large anterior MI with extensive
myocardial damage at a very young age without a strong family
history or risk factors. The primary team sent a hypercoaguable
workup which the results of were still pending on discharge. Her
peak CK was [**2125**] and peak trop was 2.86.  She had a stent placed
in her LAD. During the procedue she had a very high wedge
pressure and evidence of failure. She was placed on a balloon
pump and transferred to the CCU. The balloon pump was weaned
slowly. This was complicated by an external and likely
retripenittal bleed around her balloon pump. The pump was
removed and she was transfused a unit of blood. She continued to
have chest pain for some time after her MI. A re-look cath
showed a widely patent stent. She was placed ASA, BB, Plavix.
She had an echo before her discharge which showed  mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
lateral apex with 3+ MR. She will follow up in [**Hospital 56786**] clinic.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platlets dropped from 165 on
admission to the 80's in 2 days. All heparin products were
stopped and HIT ab were sent. This was still pending on
discharge and should be followed up by her primary physcian.
