CXR [**2173-4-14**]: FINDINGS: AP upright portable chest radiograph is
obtained. As compared with the prior radiograph, there has been
no significant change. Motion artifact somewhat limits
evaluation. Bilateral extensive parenchymal opacities are again
noted, consistent with the provided history of ARDS. There has
been no significant interval change. Small bilateral pleural
effusions cannot be excluded. Heart size is difficult to assess.
No large pneumothorax is present. Bony structures appear intact.



Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxic Resp Distress: Pt with poor substrate given recent
ARDS who p/w fever, increased O2 requirement and worsening in
bilateral infiltrates concerning for PNA. Appeared clinically
euvolemic to dry and large A-a gradient on ABG.  There was no
evidence of COPD exacerbation or acute CO2 retention.
Oxygenation remained poor despite broad spectrum antibiotics,
patient was unable to be weaned off O2, he remained on 6 L plus
facemask.  After discussion with HCP and patient on [**4-15**],
decision was made to transition patient to CMO.  IV antibiotics
were continued at the family's request because they wanted to
have some more time to spend with him.  Patient passed away on
[**2173-4-18**].
.
# GI bleed: Pt presented with guaiac positive black stools, but
had stable hematocrit at his baseline.  He likely has a slow
upper GI bleed.  After patient was made CMO, morphine was used
to treat abdominal pain.
