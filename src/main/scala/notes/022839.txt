CXR ([**4-7**])--There has been interval partial reexpansion of the
atelectatic changes at the right base and in the left mid lung
field, but new atelectasis is now seen in the retrocardiac left
lower lobe.

CXR ([**4-8**])--IMPRESSION: Improving right lower lobe opacity.
Satisfactory position of lines and tubes.

CXR ([**4-9**])--1) Tiny right apical pneumothorax following right
chest tube removal.
2) Satisfactory tracheostomy tube placement.
3) Improving bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.

CXR ([**4-12**])--Worsening left retrocardiac opacity as well as
development of
patchy right lower lobe opacity. The fluctuating nature of these
opacities on serial films favors atelectasis or recurrent
aspiration as the likely
etiology.

CXR ([**4-18**])--No pneumonia or pneumothorax.

CXR ([**4-24**])--Mild bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted [**2133-4-6**] for pre-op of trachealplasty done [**4-7**].
Immediately post op...
Post-Op course in CSRU c/b resp failure requiring intubation,
sedation, and fever 102 for which she was cultured.
POD#1-  Temp 100.4. Bronch done w/ good results of surgical
site, minimal secretions. Sedation weaned, pt stable, good cuff
leak present, followed by extubation. Pt immediately developed
stridor unresponsive to recemic epinephrine and albuterol nebs
over 5 minutes w/o improvement. Sats remained over 93%. Pt
re-intubated w/ plan of continued recemic epinephrine, diuresis,
HOB elevated.
Patient remained in ICU w/ qd x3 attempted extubations all
requiring re-intubation for stridor. Started on linezolid and
levofloxacin for MRSA in sputum 3 week course until [**2133-4-30**].
Flex and rigid bronchoscopies done indicate superior tracheal
malacia above trachealplasty.
Tracheostomy done [**4-10**] and remained in place for secretion
clearance, [**Month/Year (2) 46569**] maintenance, resting of tracheal tissue edema,
independence of activity post-op with plan for re-evaluation in
1 week.
Patient required aggressive pulmonary toilet with
humidification, albuterol nebs, CPT, hydration to liquify
secretions for clearance.
POD#11- To OR for Cervical trachealplasty, tolerated procedure
well, trach removed, transferred to SICU intubated. Overnighted
x2 in SICU for observation of [**Month/Year (2) 46569**] maintenance and secretion
clearance w/ daily bronchoscopies to assist and maintain
secretion clearance. Failed extubation x1, then successful on
POD #14/3.
Transferred to floor on POD#15/4 w/ aggressive pulmonary toilet,
CPT, ambuation and hydration. Nausea intermittently controlled
w/ anzemet somewhat limiting hydration efforts.
Patient stable on floor and preparing for discharge POD# 16/6
when experienced significant secretions w/ inability to clear
secretions, O2 sat 80%, requiring emergent bronchoscopy and
transfer to SICU for bronch and observation.
Pt bronched am POD#17/7, clearance mod amt secretions, stable
and transferred to floor.  She was ambulating comfortably,
eating a regular diet with controlled pain on POD#19/9, and was
considered stable for discharge with follow-up within the week.
