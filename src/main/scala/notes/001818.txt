Social History:
Patient is married with one son, denies tobacco, minimal EtOH


Family History:
Grandmother died from a CVA at age 50. Father died at age 70
from complications of diabetes.

Physical Exam:
awake and alert
Lungs- clear
cor-R at 70. crisp cardiac sounds, no murmur
exts- 2- edema legs, not tense
Abdomen- soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds
wounds- clean and dry. sternum is stable.

Pertinent Results:
[**2202-10-11**] ECHO
Pre Bypass
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is mild valvular
mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass
The patient is AV-paced and on an infusion of epinephrine .04
mcg/kg/min.. Left and right ventricular function is preserved.
The aorta is intact. There is [**2-7**]+ tricuspid regurgitation. The
mean gradient of the tricuspid valve was < 5mmHg. The mitral
valve mechanical prosthesis is in good position with a mean
gradient <6mmHg.. There is a mild mitral perivalvular leak.
Remaining exam is unchanged. These findings were communicated
intraoperatively to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 9996**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2202-10-11**] for elective
surgical management of her mitral and triccuspid valve disease.
She was taken directly to the operating room where she underwent
a redo sternotomy with a mitral valve replacement using a 27mm
St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve and a tricuspid valve
repair/annuloplasty. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring.  She weaned fro bypass on epinephrine and propafol.
She was AV paced due to underlying complete heart block.Within
24 hours she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. The
pressor was weaned,however, she remained in heart block with a
ventricular rate in the 30s.  On POD 3 she was in sinus rhythm
with first degree block in the 50s and stable.  She was
transferred to the floor.

Diuresis was continued, to remove fluid overload that existed
preoperatively as well as secondary to the surgery. She
developed atrial flutter subsequently.  The EPS service saw her
and cardioversion was planned.  On POD6 her INR was greater than
6 and 2 units of FFP were administered, with a fall of the INR
to 4.

The following day her INR was 3.1 and she received 1mg of
Coumadin.  cardioversion with 200jouoles successfully converted
her to SR which persisted at discharge.  her INR was 2.4 the day
of discharge and 2 mg of Coumadin was ordered.

Her weight fell with diuresis and edema improved.  She remained
stable and felt well. She was ready for discharge and diuretics
will be continued.

Arrangement were made for her follow-up for Coumadin dosing with
her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. She will take 2mg
[**10-20**] and 16 then have a PT/INR checked on[**10-22**] and talk with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further orders.  She is to return in 2 weeks for
staple removal.
