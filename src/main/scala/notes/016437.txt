CTA ([**9-15**]): No PE. Increase in soft tissue density in RUL
suspicious for tumor vs radiation fibrosis. Moderate pericardial
effusion increased since prior study.

[**Hospital1 18**]:

Echo [**9-20**]: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

EKG: sinus tach @ 102, nl axis, PR depression, poor R wave

All blood cultures taken at [**Hospital1 18**] were negative


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for hemoptysis/transfer for
? tracheal stent placement.  Hospital course was significant for
the following issues:

1. Fever/leukocytosis: Likely secondary to post-obstructive PNA.
Gram positive cocci on sputum cx from OSH.  Sputum culture
obtained at [**Hospital1 18**] with > 25 PMNs, culture with + MRSA.
Bronchoscopy noted purulent sputum in L lung which was
suctioned.  Blood cultures with no growth to date at discharge.
UA, urine culture negative.
  The patient spiked to 103 on [**9-20**] and was started on
vancomycin and zosyn.  His L femoral line was removed and the
tip was sent for culture--there was no growth to date.  A new
subclavian central line was placed under sterile conditions on
[**2197-9-21**].

2. Hemoptysis/respiratory failure: Bronchoscopy performed on
[**9-22**] revealed a tortuous and macerated trachea with significant
tumor infiltration along the length of trachea extending into
the right and left mainstem bronchi. Three stents were placed:
14x2 mm stent in R mainstem bronchus, 12x4 mm stent in L
mainstem bronchus and 20x4mm tracheal stent.  The patient
continued to have small amounts of blood in the ET tube.  Serial
hct were stable.
  The patient remained intubated after the procedure and
required high doses of sedation to remain comfortable.  After
the bronchoscopy with stent placement, his sedation began to be
weaned. His ABG's were good on minimal ventilatory support.  His
ABG on [**2197-9-22**] was 7.46/39/120 on AC 600 x 18, PEEP 8, FIO2 .60.
 Over the next two days s/p the procedure he was slowly weaned
off his fentanyl and midazolam drips along with the pressor
support with neo-synephrine.  By post-procedure day 3, [**9-25**] the
pressor was completely weaned off and breathing well on pressure
support ventilation.  He was therefore extubated on [**9-25**].  This
was well tolerated with good oxygen saturation post extubation.

    The patient did exhibit anxiety subsequent to extubation and
discontinuation of sedation.  This was chiefly managed via
ativan given per the CIWA protocol.  The patient also remained
somewhat drowsy after stoppage of sedation but has slowly grown
more alert.

3. Anemia: The hct stable at 30.  He required no transfusions.
He remained intermittently guaiac positive on exam and would
likely benefit from outpatient colonoscopy in the future.

4. Hypotension:  The patient was initially weaned off pressors;
however, as his sedation requiremnt increased, his BP required
more support and neo was re-started. Given his fever spike,
there was some concern for septic physiology and he was started
on antibiotics as above.  His BP also i
