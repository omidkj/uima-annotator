Transesophageal Echocardiography


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 y/oM with diabetes and reportedly labile
sugars recently, also recently s/p ORIF after fall in [**3-24**] and
recent admission from [**Date range (3) 17395**] for urosepsis at [**Hospital3 **],
who was transferred from his nursing unit at Life Care Center of
[**Location (un) 5165**] to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED today for weakness and fatigue. His
family felt that he had been doing poorly over the last several
days with labile blood sugars ranging by report from 60s to over
400 on his regimen of NPH and novolog sliding scale.  He had
also increasing confusion over the last several days as well. He
was scheduled for TURP today for his BPH (has indwelling foley)
but this was cancelled and he was transferred at family request
to [**Hospital1 18**].

His recent hospitalization sepsis in the above dates was notable
per discharge summary for ??????Urosepsis with methicillin-reisistant
staphylococcus aureus bacteremia?????? and r/o endocarditis and
seeding of right hip. He was found to have MRSA in his urine
culture, and then [**2-19**] blood culture bottles were MRSA as well.
He underwent TEE which had a question of an old aortic anterior
leaflet vegetation, and subsequently underwent TEE which showed
no evidence of valvular lesions. The treating team noted in
their d/c summary that they believed he had a MRSA UTI with
blood seeding secondary to urinary retention. He was treated
with vancomycin. His creatinine prior discharge was 1.7, and was
started on linezolid IV for ten days, completing a course of
antibiotics on [**2183-5-13**].

He was on lovenox previously, but this had been discontinued at
the rehab.

He presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where his vitals at triage were  T
97.8 HR 72 BP 132/78 RR 18 O2 Sat 98% on Room Air.  He was found
to be in DKA/HONK, and after cultures was started on
vanc/ceftriaxone empirically.

He was found to have a melanotic bowel movement in the ED
(confirmed guaiac positive). GI was consulted to see him, but as
he remained hemodynically stable, an immediate scope was not
planned. NG lavage was attempted but unsuccessful in the ED.

Neck, soft tissue ultrasound [**6-6**]:
1.5 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm echopenic lesion over the left clavicular
head most likely represent a synovial fluid pocket/cyst, less
likely a lymph node. Followup imaging can be performed as
clinically indicated.

LENIs [**6-6**]:
No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.

Hip films [**6-6**]: The patient is status post ORIF of an
intratrochanteric fracture of the left femur. The fracture is
comminuted. The hardware is intact. There is no evidence for
loosening or fracture of the hardware.

Left knee [**6-6**]: A portable lateral film is provided of the left
knee. This demonstrates hardware in adequate position. There is
no evidence of loosening. No osteolytic changes are seen.
--------
[**2183-6-8**] CT Left shoulder: IMPRESSION:

1. No obvious left shoulder effusion or bony abnormality
involving the left
shoulder, aside from minor degenerative change.

2. Relatively large pulmonary artery embolus involving the left
main
pulmonary artery and branches to the left upper lobe and lingula
and left
lower lobe.

3. Minimal fluid in the left sternoclavicular joint. Nearby soft
tissue
calcification could represent chondrocalcinosis. Finding
described on recent
ultrasound is not definitively identified, but might not be
appreciated on
this exam due to resolution and artifact from nearby bone.
-------
MRI Cervical and Thoracic Spine:
IMPRESSION: Study somewhat limited by lack of contrast. Possible
discitis
osteomyelitis at T12 and the adjacent endplates. There is
epidural soft
tissue at T11-T12 contiguous with the disc , which may represent
a focal disc herniation, although the possibility of a tiny
epidural abscess cannot be excluded. There is mild focal
kyphotic angulation at this level. However, evaluation is
limited due to lack of gadolinium and motion degradation on the
axial images through this region.

There is abnormal signal within the C3 and adjacent C4 vertebral
bodies.
Findings most likely related to DJD but possibility of infection
cannot be
entirely excluded.

Moderate cervical spondylosis as detailed above.
------

TEE:  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There are
filamentous strands on the tip of the right coronary cusp
measuring 0.6cm x 0.2cm most consistent with Lambl's excresences
(normal variant), but cannot exclude endocarditis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the tricuspid valve.. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression: Filamentous strand on the aortic valve most
consistent with Lambl's excresence (normal variant), but cannot
exclude endocarditis.

CT Scan Pelvis and Abdomen:
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Moderate right and small left pleural
effusions are
new since [**2181**] with asso
