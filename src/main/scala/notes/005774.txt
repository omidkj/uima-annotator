Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
# Central line placement
# Dobhoff placement x2
# Hemodialysis 3xweekly
# Burr hole evacuation of L subdural hematoma

History of Present Illness:
89M h/o ESRD, HTN who presented to an OSH with mental status
changes. Per daughter, she found her father lying on the couch
in the morning which was unusual as he usually was in the yard
at that time. He had been scheduled to go to dialysis, and was
noted to be slow to respond and had a blank stare on his face.
Of note, he had fallen 2 weeks ago when he slipped down the
stairs but he suffered no obvious injuries and did not seek any
medical care at the time. At baseline, he was active and
ambulated on his own. The patient was brought to an OSH where a
head CT showed bilateral subdural hematomas. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up. Repeat CT at [**Hospital1 **] confirmed initial
findings. He was then intubated in the setting of increased
agitation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED his initial vitals were T 101.8 BP 148/79 AR 81
RR 22 O2 sat 96% on NRB. He received Dilantin 150mmg IV x1.

Microbiology:
- Serial Blood cultures and Urine cultures have all been
negative.
- C.Diff positive on [**9-16**]
- C.Diff negative on [**10-5**]
.
Studies:
[**9-9**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
Bilateral acute-on-chronic subdural hematomas, left greater than
right. No
significant interval change when compared to outside hospital
study provided on film.  Minimal right-sided midline shift (3
mm).  No transtentorial herniation.
.
[**2152-9-30**] CT Chest: CHEST:  There are multiple collateral vessels
seen along the right chest.  There is also high-grade stenosis
of the right brachiocephalic vein at the level of thoracic
inlet.  There is severe atherosclerosis involving the aorta and
visualized branch vessels.  Large amounts of mural plaque are
present within an irregular aorta.  There is no dissection flap
identified.  There are three small filling defects noted within
subsegmental pulmonary artery branches supplying the right upper
lobe, consistent with small pulmonary emboli.  No additional
pulmonary emboli are identified.  There are also multiple
prominent mediastinal lymph nodes which may be reactive in
nature.  There is right lower lobe airspace disease, most
consistent with pneumonia. There is a moderate left pleural
effusion with associated atelectasis.  There
is no pneumothorax.
UPPER ABDOMEN:  Limited visualization of the upper abdomen
demonstrates a
gastrostomy tube within the stomach.  Multiple splenic
calcifications are
noted, likely related to prior granulomatous disease.  Kidneys
are atrophic with bilateral cysts.  Dense atherosclerotic
calcification of aorta and branch vessels is present.  There is
degenerative change of the spine.
IMPRESSION:  Subsegmental pulmonary emboli to the right upper
lobe.
Right lower lobe pneumonia with prominent mediastinal lymph
nodes, which may be reactive.  Followup to resolution suggested.

.
[**2152-10-1**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
ABDOMEN:  Images through the lung bases demonstrate a small left
pleural
effusion and bibasilar airspace disease which may be infectious,
atelectasis, or aspiration.  The heart is enlarged.  There is
atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta and coronary
arteries.  Degenerative change of the spine is noted.
.
Liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal.  There are
splenic
calcifications, likely related to prior granulomatous disease.
There is
atrophy of the kidneys with bilateral cysts also noted.  A
gastrostomy tube is in place.  Visualized bowel loops are normal
in caliber.  There is no free intraperitoneal air or fluid.
There is a 3.2-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm as well
as aneurysmal dilatation of the left common iliac artery,
measuring 1.8 cm.
.
PELVIS:  There are no pelvic masses, lymphadenopathy, or
significant free
fluid.  Bowel loops are normal in caliber. However, the sigmoid
colon and
rectum appear featureless and contain more fluid than expected.
The finding is nonspecific, but can be seen with colitis.  Dense
atherosclerotic vascular calcification is present.
.
IMPRESSION:  No CT evidence of bowel wall thickening, megacolon,
or abscess as clinically questioned.
Featureless sigmoid colon and rectum containing fluid, which can
be seen with colitis.
.
[**2152-10-2**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
2. No other significant change from prior study.
.
[**2152-10-5**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Unchanged size and appearance of bilateral subdural
hematoma.  There has been no interval changes in shift of normal
midline structures and secondary mass effects.
.
[**2152-10-9**] CT Head:
FINDINGS: The large left-sided frontoparietal subdural hematoma
is unchanged in size, with a maximal thickness of 3.1 cm. There
is stable subfalcine herniation with a midline shift of 8 mm.
The very small subdural collection along the right frontal lobe
measuring up to 7 mm is also stable. There is no evidence of
transtentorial herniation. Mass effect on the left lateral
ventricle is stable. There is no hydrocephalus. No major
vascular territorial infarct is seen.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Bony structures and surrounding soft tissue structures remain
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable size of large left and small right subdural hematoma
with stable rightward midline shift.
.
CXR [**2152-10-12**]:
In comparison with the previous examination of [**10-9**], the patient
is not obliqued on the current study. There is progressive
clearing of opacification at the left base. This may reflect
some residual atelectatic change. The right central catheter
extends to several cm below the level of the carina. The left
PICC line extends to just above the carina.
IMPRESSION: Progressive clearing of the left basilar
opacification. Central catheters re
