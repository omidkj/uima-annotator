History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 54898**] is a 64F with a history of chronic lung disease of
unclear etiology who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 956**]
[**2137**] with dyspnea and hypoxia and was also admitted with
respiratory arrest in [**2136-8-5**] requiring intubation. She
presents now with similar complaints, though states that she
"feels worse" this time than she did at the onset of her
previous episode. She states that she initially was told she had
problems with her lungs (? bronciectasis) at [**University/College **]
Presbyterian where she was seen in [**2128**] and treated as an
outpatient with antibiotics (two episodes of heavy mucous
production). She was then relatively symptom-free for several
years and does not feel that she has had baseline respiratory
problems. Since [**Name2 (NI) 216**] when she was admitted with acute
respiratory distress (? allergic reaction), she has had problems
with her breathing that have not gone all the way away. She
states that she notices SOB with climbing stairs and activity as
well as with sleeping. Over the past month, she has had
worsening of symptoms. She was admitted in [**Month (only) 956**] with hypoxia
and cough, and since discharge has felt her breathing has been
poor. She has a home nebulizer and albuterol inhaler and has
used these medications ferquently (multiple times per day). She
has also used Robitussin for cough. Her cough is occasionally
productive of thick yellow or brown mucous, though for the past
two days it has been more dry than usual and she has also
noticed flecks of blood (no grossly bloody sputum). She has
chest pain worse with coughing or deep inspiration. She was
prompted to seek medical attention in the ED today because she
felt very weak and "like I couldn't walk" - she reports her feet
felt not numb but "I cannot describe the sensation" and she did
not feel she could safely stand. She
.
During her admission in [**Month (only) 956**], she was seen by the pulmonary
consult team who recommended a 10-day course of abtibiotics
(initially doxycycline given concern for possible Pertussis,
changed to levofloxacin after ENT evaluation over concern for
concurrent sinusitis). She was also evaluated by the ENT team
for question of vocal cord dysfunction, though no abnormalities
were noted. She received a single dose of IV steroids in the ED
but no further steroid treatment. She was given Tylenol with
codeine for cough. She was discharged to follow up with a new
PCP and pulmonologist, though she did not attend either
appointment.
.
In [**2136-8-5**], she had a separate admission for respiratory
arrest attributed to allergic reaction/anaphylaxis, though it
was questionable whether she actually took the medication (never
identified, possibly [**Year (4 digits) 54897**]) that the reaction was attributed
to. She was treated for a likely anaphylactic reaction with
epipen, h2 blocker, and benadryl.  She was intubated for
respiratory arrest.  She also received solumedrol, nebs, 5L of
NS, and briefly required pressors. She rapidly improved after
treatment with epinephrine and was extubated on the day of
admission. She was treated with a 3-day burst of steroids and
was satting well on room air at discharge. She was seen by the
pulmonary team during that admission and was discharged with
follow up appointments with both pulmonology and allergy, which
she did not attend.
.
Upon arrival to the ED vitals were T 99.2, HR 90, BP 152/87, RR
18, 95% on NRB. She was noted to be hypoxic to low 80s on room
air, though speaking in complete sentences. She received 125 mg
of IV solumedrol, a dose of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, 2 g of
IV magnesium, and duonebs. She improved slightly but remained
tachypneic with rate in 20s and given her history of intubation
she was admitted to the ICU. No attempt to wean her O2 was made
in the ED. On transfer to the MICU, vitals were HR 98, BP
138/62, RR 26, 95% on 15L NRB.
.
On arrival to the floor, she states she is feeling unwell. Of
note, she is a very vague historian and has difficulty
pinpointing details or responding definitively to questions. Her
breathing is poor, but slightly improved from in the ED. She has
pain in her chest and abdomen, worse with coughing. Her daughter
is with her in the room.

- H. Pylori positive ulcer
- C. section 29 years ago

Physical Exam:
ADMISSION:
GEN: Awake in bed, answering questions, oriented, able to
complete sentences though
HEENT: Left pupil 3 mm, R pupil 5 mm, both reactive. EOMI. No
sinus TTP. Clear OP though dry MM (on venti mask).
NECK: No JVD, supple
PULM: Poor air movement bilaterally. Inspiratory and expiratory
wheezing diffusely but most pronouced anteriorly.
CARD: Regular rhythm, borderline tachycardia (~100 bpm), no
M/R/G appreciated though difficult to hear given wheezing
ABD: Soft, + diffuse TTP possibly worse in the epigastric
region, no organomegaly, no rebound/guarding
EXT: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally, trace pedal edema (no pitting)
SKIN: Erythema along nasolabial folds in pattern suggestive of
irritation from face mask; some additional mild erythema over
left eyebrow (not raised, no scale)
NEURO: Sensation to light touch grossly intact though patient
has difficulty characterizing sensation as "normal." Strength
seems [**5-9**] in major muscle groups of UE and LE, though effort is
questionable and she is possibly slightly weaker on left side in
triceps and ileopsoas.
PSYCH: Anxious affect
