Final Report
INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with altered mental status, any
evidence of
stroke or hemorrhage.

COMPARISON: CT head on [**2176-3-26**] at 20:49 and 9:02.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
brain. No
contrast was administered. Study is severely limited due to
patient motion
causing artifact.

FINDINGS: Within the limitation of motion artifact, there is no
gross
evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large
vascular
territorial infarction. The previously seen areas of
encephalomalacia in the
right frontoparietal, left occipital, and cerebellar hemispheres
