Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with hx of HTN, HLD, Crohn's Disease on low dose prednisone,
and recurrent Cdiff on vancomycin suppression here for syncopal
episode this AM followed by chest pain. She has been sufferring
from frequent diarrhea and poor PO intake over the past few
weeks and was recently admitted here from [**Date range (1) 96183**] for workup
which was significant for negative stool and blood cultures as
well as CT abdomen without evidence of crohns flair but findings
suspicious for pancreatic cancer. During this period, she has
continued to take her blood pressure medications and has been
feeling generally unwell. This morning, she felt light-headed
and had a pre-syncopal event but never lost conciousness.
Following this event, she stood up and felt acutely nauseated
and vomited NBNB emesis x 1. Following emesis she developed
acute onset substernal chest discomfort prompting visit to the
ED. On arrival to the ED, she was chestpain free but then had a
short bout of chest pain that spontaneously resolved without
treatment. In the ED, she had an EKG with concerning-appearing
STE in the anterior leads (mostly V2), CXR with concern for ?RML
infiltrate and mild fluid overload, and was given full-dose
aspirin, loading plavix 300mg, and was started on a heparin drip
(guiaic positive on rectal but brown stool). Nitro and
b-blockers were deferred given the fact that she had borderline
blood pressures in the 80-90's systolically. She was also
started on azithro and ceftriaxone for CAP coverage. Cards was
consulted in the ED and saw the patient, felt her story was
concerning for NSTEMI, and performed bedside ECHO which
demonstrated septal and anterior wall hypokinesis which was a
change from prior ECHO from 11 years ago. Per ED report, family
at this time was unsure if they were interested in pursuing
central venous access so this was deferred to CCU. Her pressure
briefly dropped to the 70's with return to the 90's without any
intervention.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she is HD stable and chest-pain free. She
confirms the above history. Additionally, she denies orthopnea,
new DOE, PND, any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, or hemoptysis. S/he denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

[**12-12**] ANKLE XRAY LEFT Significant soft tissue swelling about the
ankle. Atherosclerotic vascular calcifications. No definite
ankle effusion. Osteopenia. An ossific fragment is seen dorsal
to the talar head, consistent with capsular avulsion fracture.
No other fractures identified. No dislocation. The mortise and
syndesmosis are intact. IMPRESSION: Talar head avulsion fracture
as above.
.
[**12-12**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM The left atrium is elongated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the
distal septum and anterior wall. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction. Mild-moderate aortic
regurgitation
