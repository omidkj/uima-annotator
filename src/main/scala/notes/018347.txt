Admission Date:  [**2152-12-21**]       Discharge Date: [**2153-1-25**]


Service:  General surgery -- Blue service.

NOTE:  This is an interim summary.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Malaise and low grade fevers and abdominal
pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 year old
female with past medical history significant for
gastroesophageal reflux disease, colon cancer, noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, who is well known to the general
surgery blue service, as she underwent an antrectomy/vagotomy
with Bilroth II reconstruction as well as splenectomy and
partial pancreatectomy for a large bleeding duodenal ulcer on
[**2152-11-25**].  She recovered well from this previous surgery and
she was discharged to acute care rehabilitation on [**2152-12-8**]
with both a duodenostomy tube in the afferent limb of her
gastrojejunostomy and a feeding jejunostomy tube placed. She
was sent to the Emergency Department on [**2152-12-21**] with report
of fevers, abdominal pain and general malaise, as well as a
report of some purulent drainage from her former right upper
quadrant [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for gastroesophageal
reflux disease; colon cancer; ventral hernia; chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease; asthma; noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus; cataracts; arthritis; bleeding duodenal
ulcer.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Right colectomy.  Cataract surgery.
Ventral herniorrhaphy. Bilateral hip replacements.
Antrectomy/vagotomy with Bilroth II repair.  Splenectomy.
Distal pancreatectomy.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Lasix 40 mg q. a.m. and 20 q. p.m.
2.  Atrovent.
3.  NPH 10 units q. a.m.
4.  Ambien 5 mg q h.s.
5.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Zinc 20 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Flovent two puffs twice a day.
8.  Paxil 20 mg p.o. q. day.
9.  Protonic 40 mg p.o. twice a day.
10. Reglan 10 mg p.o. q.o.d.
11. Aldactone 25 mg p.o. twice a day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile at 98.6; pulse 80;
blood pressure 125/55; respiratory rate 18; oxygen saturation
96% on three liters.  She is sleepy, oriented, in no apparent
distress.  She does have some scleral icterus.  Lungs:  She
has decreased breath sounds bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. Her abdominal
examination is significant for softness and obese.  There is
a 5 by 5 cm area that is tender, indurated and erythematous
surrounding the former right [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain site with
purulent drainage from the site.  Some fluctuance inferior to
it.  There is a duodenostomy tube with some serous drainage
from around the skin site and a feeding jejunostomy in good
position.  The prior surgical incision is well healed with no
erythema or drainage.  Rectal examination:  No masses,
nontender.  She is guaiac positive. Extremities:  She has 1+
peripheral edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count was 21.3 with a
left shift with 86% neutrophils; hematocrit of 40.5;
platelets of 355.  Sodium of 149; potassium of 3.8; chloride
of 103; bicarbonate of 36; BUN 49; creatinine 1.4; sugar of
252.  Her urinalysis shows positive nitrates and trace
leukocyte esterase.  Her PT was 12.6; PTT was 23.2; INR was
1.1.

A CAT scan of the abdomen showed a large subcutaneous
collection of air and soft tissue.  This collection did not
seem to involve the fascia.  There were also signs of a
dilated afferent limb as well as some stranding in the area
around the end of the duodenostomy stump, indicating
possibility of a duodenal stump leak.  In addition, the
radiologist noted the expected changes following a Bilroth II
reconstruction as well as a distal pancreatectomy and
splenectomy.

She had follow-up contrast studies, during which gastrografin
was injected into both the jejunostomy and duodenostomy
tubes. The J tube contrast study showed that the J tube was
in good position and there was no evident leak.  However, the
duodenostomy contrast study showed a small amount of contrast
exiting from the duodenal stump, indicating a slight leak
from the duodenal stump.

It was determined that Ms. [**Known lastname **] had an angry abdominal wall
abscess which required emergent surgery.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], after consulting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**], proceeded to
consent Ms. [**Known lastname **] to surgery and the patient was taken to the
operating room for treatment. Please refer to the previously
dictated operative note by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for the
specifics of this surgery.  However, in brief, the surgery
had the following findings:  1.) A large subcutaneous abscess
was found almost immediately after opening the skin overlying
the abdomen, with about 400 to 500 ml of purulent debris
draining almost immediately.  This purulent material was
washed out with high pressure saline and further inspection
revealed that there was a small fascial dehiscence of the
inferior aspect of Ms. [**Known lastname **] prior surgical wound.
Otherwise, Ms. [**Known lastname **] abdominal fascia was intact and once
this was repaired, two Penrose drains were placed to assist
with the drainage of the subcutaneous layer.

Intraoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname **] had several episodes of
hypotension which required the administration of pressure
support.  This, combined with the fact that the duodenal leak
appeared to be relatively minimal and would be unlikely to be
repaired by adjusting the duodenostomy tube precluded
additional intervention.  It was decided that she would be
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and managed
conservatively.  In addition, the abdominal wound was packed
with Betadine soaked Kerlix and the Penrose drains assisted
with the drainage.  Once this was completed, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, intubated and in good
condition. Wound cultures taken during this procedure
eventually grew out Vancomycin sensitive enterococcus,
pseudomonas, [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans, the anaerobe Prevotella, for
which Ms. [**Known lastname **] was put on intravenous antibiotics.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] Intensive Care Unit course was relatively
uncomplicated.  She underwent hemodynamic monitoring with an
arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter.  She continued to have
twice daily dressing changes with wet to dry gauze of her
abdominal wound in the subcutaneous layer.  TPN and tube
feeds were started on postoperative day number three and Mrs.
[**Known lastname **] actually began taking p.o. on postoperative day number
five.  While in the Intensive Care Unit, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] also
received several red blood cell transfusions.  On
postoperative day number six, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to
the floor, as she was doing very well.  However, she bounced
right back to the Intensive Care Unit after she suffered an
episode of confusion, low grade fever and tachycardia.  Blood
cultures were sent.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] central venous access line
was changed; however.  Electrocardiogram, chest x-ray and
arterial blood gases were all obtained; however, one of these
tests resulted in a diagnosis.  This episode was attributed
to a reaction to the intravenous Dilaudid that Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
receiving for her dressing changes.  This is in agreement
with the prior allergy to Percocet, noted from her prior
admission.

The second Intensive Care Unit stay was also uncomplicated
and on [**12-31**], which was postoperative day number nine,
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred back to the floor. The rest of her
floor stay can be described in an organ system base fashion.

Neurologic:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on very small doses of
Demerol to assist with her dressing changes. By [**1-2**],
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was actually able to tolerate the dressing changes
without any narcotics.  In addition, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was soon
started on her home dose of Paxil which she [**Known lastname 8337**] well.
Her pain, for the rest of her hospital stay of note was
easily controlled with Tylenol.
