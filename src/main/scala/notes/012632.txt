Admission Date:  [**2152-9-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2152-10-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2075-12-17**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU-WEST

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 76 year old woman
transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with complaints of
increasing shortness of breath times two weeks status post a
fall after which she presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on the
[**10-16**].  Recently, arterial blood gas at [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital was pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 100 and pO2 of 73 on a four
liter per minute nasal cannula.  Chest x-ray there reportedly
showed moderate congestion as well as bibasilar
consolidation.

The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1474**] Intensive Care Unit
and intubated for hypoxia and hypercapnia.  The patient was
diuresed for failure and also given nebulizers.  She was
successfully extubated on the [**10-24**], reintubated
later that same day for flash pulmonary edema believed to be
secondary to her aortic stenosis.

The patient also was found to have low platelets in the 40s
but refused bone marrow biopsy work-up for etiology.  The
patient received Flagyl, Vancomycin and Gadafloxacin
empirically for this presumed pneumonia, as the patient
developed fever and leukocytosis after ventilation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure secondary to aortic stenosis;
valve area of approximately 0.8 centimeters squared.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home O2.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Coronary artery disease.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Flovent.
2.  Beconase.
3.  Zocor 40 q. day.
4.  Ativan 0.5 p.o. p.r.n.
5.  Aspirin 325 daily.
6.  Lasix 60 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  MS-Contin 15 p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:   Include penicillin and questionable sulfa
allergy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   She is a former smoker; quit tobacco 15
years ago.  Denies ETOH or illicit drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Pertinent for coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On presentation to the Coronary Care
Unit, temperature is 99.3 F.; heart rate 85; blood pressure
93/39; respiratory rate 22, 97% on the vent.  Examination
shows a well developed, intubated woman in no apparent
distress.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Lung examination was limited by the ventilator but is noted
to be generally clear.  Cardiovascular examination notable
for II-III/VI holosystolic murmur to the carotids.  Abdomen
soft, nontender, nondistended, normal bowel sounds were
present.  Extremities notable for one plus bilateral lower
extremity edema.  The patient arrived with a right intra...
cordis.

LABORATORY:   EKG was notable for a normal sinus rhythm,
normal axis, single Q in lead III.

Initial white blood cell count 10.7, hematocrit 20.6,
platelets 46.

Chem-7 was unremarkable.

Initial arterial blood gas was 7.33 pH, pCO2 91, pO2 126.
This is on ventilator settings of CPAP with pressure support
of 10 and PEEP of 5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Attempts to extubate were deferred pending
repair of her aortic valve.  An echocardiogram was done.  The
patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Service
of [**Hospital1 69**] for surgical
intervention of her aortic stenosis, but after review of her
comorbidities, the Surgical Team felt that the patient would
be more appropriately served by the Coronary Care Unit team.

The patient underwent a valvuloplasty on the [****]
and her aortic valve area increased from pre-procedure to
0.73 squared centimeters with a mean gradient of 45 to an
area of 1.27 squared centimeters with a mean gradient of 25.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Attempts were subsequently made to diurese her and then to
wean her off of the ventilator.  Diuresis was successful,
however, attempts on respiratory trials while using RSBI
values less than 105, however, the patient desaturated to
80%, therefore a final definitive attempt was made on the [**2152-10-3**].  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and did not require BiPAP or CPAP post extubation.  The
patient's saturations remained approximately 90% on two to
four liters of nasal cannula with initial supplements
provided by a 40% oxygen tent.

The patient did remain wheezy after the initial procedure and
required two -hour Albuterol q. six hours and Atrovent
nebulizers.  She also received supplemental treatments of
Fluticasone, Salmeterol as well as additional supplementals
of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-leukacast.  The patient was less wheezy the
subsequent day.

Of note, during the patient's hospitalization, one sputum
culture grew out sparse Aspergillus.  A call to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital revealed that they had a similar sputum culture for
which the final identification is pending.  Infectious
Disease has been consulted but at this point a CT scan was
recommended, however, the patient refused CT scan secondary
to her claustrophobia.

As of this dictation, her liver function tests are being
evaluated.  Pending normal values, the patient will be
empirically started on anti-fungal agents for empiric
treatment of Aspergillus, albeit the clinical suspicion given
her lack of fever and leukocytosis to remain low.

Follow-up on these results as well as Discharge Medications
will be dictated as an addendum to this discharge summary.
