and increasing LE edema.
Pt was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-29**].  Since then family
describes patient with decreased PO intake secondary to poor
appetite, but pt without nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  Has had
regular but small BM since discharge; not taking much pain meds.
Also c/o decreased UOP consistently since discharge.
Concurrently family describes pt w/increasing abdominal girth
and increasing serous drainage from medial portion of wound
incision with movement, requiring dressing changes 3x/day,
3x/night.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 y/o male with known cholangiocarcinoma who underwent ex-lap
with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  on [**2171-10-22**] and was unable to be
resected. Since his discharge on the 18th he was noted to have
increased abdominal girth, lower extremity swelling and poor
appetite as reported by family.
Ultrasound of abdomen on admission shows new ascites. He had a
paracentesis on [**11-2**] with the removal of 4 liters of fluid.
Culture done on the fluid revealed E coli. He had empirically
been started on Vanco and Zosyn which was narrowed to Zosyn with
a 14 day recommended course.
Following the paracentsis he was transferred to the SICU for
hypotension to the 80's most likely due to SBP
On [**11-3**] he underwent a gall bladder scan which showed findings
consistent with a bile leak and was sent on [**11-4**] for ERCP. He
had a bare metal stent placed on his previous admission once he
was found to be unresectable.
During ERCP;, the previous uncovered metal stent was visualized
and noted to be patent in the left hepatic system within the
common hepatic duct stricture.  The right hepatic system did not
fill with contrast.
Large bile duct leak in the mid common bile duct, probably at
the site of lymph node biopsy.
Successful placement of a 10mm x 60mm biliary covered Wallstent
in the common bile duct within the previously placed uncovered
metal stent 8mm x 60mm.
On the same day he underwent placemnt of a pigtail drain into
the collection in his abdomen (right flank) which immediately
drained about 800 cc of bilious appearing fluid. Large volumes
were being drained daily of [**2-12**] Liters. He was receiving albumin
and fluid replacements. The drain was removed  on [**11-8**] and
insertion sutured, with no leak.
He was transferred back out of the SICU and was making daily
improvements in appetite, ambulation and bowel function.
He was seen by the Renal team for acute on chronic renal
failure. Management included some medications to be renally dose
and the addition of bicarbonate to his regimen. He did not
require renal replacement therapy. At the current time of
discharge the plan is to keep patient off diuretics with
monitoring of his labs and reinstitution once the kidney
function improves.
In regards to his known CHF, digoxin and amiodarone were renally
dosed and volume status carefully monitored. Diuretics will stay
on hold per renal recommendations until kidney function
improves. Daily weights will be requested. He was also seen by
cardiology during this admission for medication management.
He was seen by the wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 79019**] Stage II
decubitus ulcers.
Stage II pressure ulcer: Duoderm gel/Allevyn foam dressing.
