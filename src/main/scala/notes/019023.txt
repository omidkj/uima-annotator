Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Airway Intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 39 year-old female with a history of depression and
PIH who presents from OSH per family request s/p seizure at 2
weeks postpartum. She presented to the OSH on [**2152-10-20**] after she
was witnessed to have a tonic-clonic seizure by her partner with
another seizure witnessed by EMS en route. She was admitted to
[**Hospital1 2177**], with BP=250/105, and treated with magnesium sulfate for
presumed eclampsia with subsequent intubation for airway
protection in ED. Brain MRI at this time was consistent with
Posterior Reversible Leukencephalopathy.
.
Patient was then extubated on Sunday (HD#2), but was reintubated
after becoming agitated and hypertensive. CXR at this point
showed new RUL infiltrate and pulmonary edema. Subsequent echo
showed EF=55% with no valvular abnormalities or diastolic
dysfunction. She was initially treated empirically with
clindamycin and ceftriaxone. Sputum grew 4+ MSSA and urine grew
Klebsiella. Patient was febrile with leukocytosis and copious
secretions, switched to Levofloxacin. Hypertension/eclampsia was
treated with labetalol and nifedipine. There was also a question
of appendicitis on CT scan, but surgery and the MICU attending
felt this was unlikely.
.
On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], intubated, vital signs were T=98.6,
BP=151/87, P=83, RR=17, and she was complaining of headache.
.
ROS: Patient indicates headache. Denies abdominal discomfort.
Patient is intubated and cannot indicate any other problems.

.
EEG: [**2152-10-28**]
IMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG mostly in the drowsy
state.
There were no lateralized or epileptiform features seen.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No valvular
pathology or pathologic flow identified.
.
IMAGING: [**2152-10-27**]
EXAM: MRI brain.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with possible reversible
encephalopathy.
TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility and
diffusion axial
images of the brain were obtained. 3D time-of-flight MRA of the
circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] acquired. 2D time-of-flight MRA of the venous sinuses
were obtained.
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:
There are no prior examinations for comparison. There is small
focus of
increased signal is seen in the left frontal subcortical white
matter.
Additionally, subtle increased signal is seen in both occipital
subcortical
white matter. No other foci with abnormalities seen within the
brain. No
acute infarcts are seen. There is no mass effect or
hydrocephalus.
Extensive soft tissue changes are seen in the sphenoid sinuses
from retained secretions. Soft tissue changes are also seen in
the left anterior ethmoid air cells and soft frontal sinus.
IMPRESSION: Subtle T2 signal abnormalities in the left parietal
and both
occipital subcortical white matter could be due to early changes
of reversible encephalopathy or due to resolving encephalopathy.
Clinical correlation with history is recommended. If there are
prior films, prior examinations, comparison would be helpful.
Extensive soft tissue changes in the sphenoid sinus. No acute
infarcts or mass effect.
.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on MRA of the head.
MRV OF THE HEAD:
Head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the superior
sagittal and
transverse sinuses as well as in the deep venous system. The
flow signal in
the deep venous system in the left transverse sinus are not well
seen on the projection images but are well visualized on the
source images.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRV of the head. No evidence of sinus
thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assesment: This is a 39 year-old female with a history of PIH, 3
weeks postpartum, who presents in transfer from [**Hospital3 9947**] with seizures, RUL infiltrate, and respiratory distress.
.
1) Respiratory Distress/RUL Infiltrate:
This likely represents an aspiration pneumonia secondary to
seizure and intubation at the OSH. Sputum grew MSSA. Initially
treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone, overall 3 days. The
patient was started on levofloxacin at [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**10-24**]. The
patient's secretions were inhibiting the ability to wean off the
ventilator. On [**10-27**] the patient failed extubation.  She became
stridorous, received heliox and racemic epinephrine. She was
found to have erythematous vocal cords and was reintubated. On
[**10-31**] the patient's vocal cords were visualized via bronchoscopy
and the patient was sucessfully extubated.
.
2) Hypertension/Eclampsia:
Patient has past history of a pregnancy complicated by
hypertension. The most recent pregnancy was induced for fetal
distress. The patient developed tonic clonic seizures two weeks
postpartum, and her overall clinical picture suggested
late-onset post-partum eclampsia. The patient's blood pressures
were controlled with labetalol 700mg TID and nifedipine 20mg TID
with a goal BP <160/90.  Neurology was consulted and recommended
a Keppra load and lorazepam if seizures recur.  She did not have
any further seizure activity. The patient had an MRI that did
not show any abnormalities and EEG did not show any seizure
activity. She was transferred to the Hospital Medicine Servic
