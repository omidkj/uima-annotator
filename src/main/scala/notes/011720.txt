tachypnea/hypotension in [**First Name3 (LF) 13042**] after ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP
central line placement
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
61F referred for ERCP for choledocholithiasis, found to be
tachypneic in [**Last Name (LF) 13042**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring
o/n. She had presented to [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital on [**1-17**] with fever,
nausea, and elevated bilirubin, where an MRCP was equivocal for
filling defects in the CBD--she is s/p CCY on [**2139-1-16**]--and so
was referred here for ERCP, which was completed evening of [**1-20**]
with removal of gallstones. The recovery area, her blood
pressures were stable 110s, but she was tachypneic and confused,
so the anesthesia staff requested ICU monitoring. On arrival in
the ICU, she remained confused but BP was then 80/40.

Also at [**Hospital3 **], she was diagnosed with an ESBL E coli
UTI (she has had recurrent UTIs for the past 2 years, which
"never get better" according to her daugther) and a possible
pna/right sided opacity on CXR, although the discharge summary
does not indicate if she ever had any pulmonary symptoms.

ROS: Pt unable to provide. Daughter reports that pt has felt
nauseaous and fatigued since recent CCY and had not been
progressing very much at rehab. Also, she thinks her mothers
dementia has been steadily progressing over the past few months.

OSH Labs:
WBC 6, Hct 9.3, Plts 85. INR 1.4. AST 67, ALT 29, Alk Phos 182,
Tbili 4.5, Dbili 2.7; urine culture grew ESBL E coli (no UA
available), Bld Cx NGTD.

Imaging:
CXR: No previous images. Left subclavian catheter extends to the
lower
portion of the SVC. No evidence of pneumothorax. Extremely low
lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of the
transverse diameter of the heart. No gross evidence of acute
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
61F s/p gastric bypass and more recently, lap CCY, with
choledocholithiasis, ESBL E coli UTI, and also question of
pneumonia who transferred from OSH for ERCP.  ERCP done done, no
pus seen.  Patient developed hypotension day after ERCP and
transiently required pressor support. Sepsis thought to be
secondary to ESBL UTI as no pus seen on ERCP.

# Sepsis:  Thought to be secondary to ESBL UTI which is from
urine culture from outside hospital.  Known from cultures at
outside hospital. After transfer, became hypotensive requiring
levophed for blood pressor support.  Was weaned off pressor
support successfully. On admission covered broadly with
antibiotics with meropenem, flagyl and vancomycin.  Flagyl and
vancomycin were discontinued given negative cultures. Her
hypotension was thought to be partially chronic, as she had
documented systolic blood pressures in the 70s at [**Hospital1 34**] and she
remained asymptomatic after being weaned off Levophed.

# Biliary Obstruction:  At the outside hospital, patient had
elevated Tbili, slightly elevated alk phos, and vague abd
complaints which was c/w choledocholithiasis.  Patient underwent
ERCP on admission here and was initially covered broadly given
hypotension with meropenem for known UTI with ESBL E. coli,
flagyl for GI anaerobes, and vancomycin for gram positive
coverage.  Flagyl and vancomycin were discontinued as above as
sepsis thought to be secondary to UTI given no pus was seen on
ERCP.

# ESBL E. coli UTI:  From outside hospital culture. Meropenem as
above. A PICC was placed to finish a 14 day total course of
meropenem at rehab.

# Malnutrition:  Patient needs frequent encouragement to
increase her food and protein intake.  This is contributing to
her anasarca.  Patient had been refusing high protein
nutritional supplements of ensure.

# Anasarca: Secondary to low albumin, lack of mobility.  On many
occassions, Patient was firmly instructed to increase her
nutritional intake and cooperate with physical therapy.

# Chronic pain: Patient on numerous pain meds at home--fentanyl
transdermal, oxycodone, ultram, as well as lidoderm and
methocarbamol.  She initially required IV morphine but was
quickly resumed on her home pain regimen.

# Pancytopenia: Based on records from [**Location (un) 5871**], this has been
long standing, with WBC [**2-5**], Hct high 20s, and plts ~100,
unresponsive to IVIG in the past, and has also received B12
supplementation as she is s/p gastric bypass, without apparent
effect. Followed counts.  Continue folate

# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine 200mcg daily

# Code: DNR/DNI was transiently reversed for ERCP. Discussed
with daugther who states she would want intubation/heroic
measures only if patient would be likley to return to at or near
her current functional status.
