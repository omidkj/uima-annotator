Admission Date:  [**2140-7-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2140-7-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**2077-9-28**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old woman with
vulvar cancer originally diagnosed in [**2131**], status post
surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy,
coronary artery disease, and severe dilated cardiomyopathy,
who presented to the hospital on [**7-11**] with perineal pain
and was noted to have genital, perineal, and sacral decubitus
ulcers.

She was evaluated by Plastic Service, General Surgery, and
Gynecology and was planned for in no acute distress with
diverting colostomy.  The patient was noted to have signs and
symptoms of congestive heart failure on admission; however,
diuresis was deferred secondary to a question of dehydration.
The patient was placed on antibiotic coverage for a possible
skin infection as well as urinary tract infection.

Further studies revealed a large right-sided pleural
effusion, hepatic congestion, as well as a left hip incision
draining sinus from a previous total hip replacement.  There
was evidence of periosteal elevation on pelvic plain films
concerning for osteomyelitis and potential septic hip joint.

On the morning of [**7-14**], the patient was noted to become
acutely short of breath.  She was placed on a nonrebreather,
and systolic blood pressures were in the 90s.  An arterial
blood gas revealed a pH of 7.3, PCO2 was 23, and PO2 was 67.
The patient was given 20 mg of intravenous Lasix without
effect and was subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Vulvar cancer.
2.  Coronary artery disease; status post cardiac
catheterization in [**2135**], status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent of the left
anterior descending artery.
3.  Cardiomyopathy; echocardiogram in [**2135**] revealed severe
global left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction
of less than 20%, severe mitral regurgitation, and moderate
pulmonary hypertension.
4.  Bilateral total hip replacements.
5.  Seizure disorder.
6.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed in [**2134**].
7.  Splenic artery aneurysm, status post embolization.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient reportedly lived at home alone
with a home health aide.  She was relatively immobile
secondary to severe degenerative arthritis.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission to the Intensive Care Unit revealed an alert,
elderly, tachypneic woman on 100  nonrebreather.  Temperature
was 95.5, heart rate was 100, blood pressure was 90/70, SpO2
was 91% to 93% on 100% nonrebreather.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat revealed sclerae were anicteric.  Pupils
were 3 mm and symmetric.  Chest revealed bilateral rales
three quarters of the way up bilaterally.  Heart was regular,
tachycardic.  Jugular venous pulsations to the angle of the
jaw.  Heart sounds were distant.  The abdomen was mildly
distended, nontender.  Extremities revealed 3+ pitting edema,
cool.  No cyanosis.  Perineum revealed extensive excoriation,
erythema, and ulcerations on the labia bilaterally.  The
posterior vulva by skin folds extending medially, perianally,
and in the sacral regions.  Neurologically, tarda dyskinesia
was present.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on
admission to the Intensive Care Unit revealed white blood
cell count was 12.6, hematocrit was 31.6, platelets were 398.
PT was 15.6, PTT was 28.8, INR was 1.2.  Sodium was 126,
potassium was 5.2, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 16, blood
urea nitrogen was 22, creatinine was 0.9, blood glucose
was 86.  Albumin was 2.5, phosphate was 2.6, calcium was 7.8,
magnesium was 1.6.  ALT was 219, AST was 469, alkaline
phosphatase was 137, total bilirubin was 0.6.  Arterial blood
gas revealed a pH of 7.3, PCO2 was 23, PO2 was 67.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray revealed a dilated heart,
pulmonary edema.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, a left
bundle-branch block, with more prominent T waves precordially
and increased ST depressions in V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 62-year-old woman with coronary
artery disease, and severe dilated cardiomyopathy, and a
history of vulvar cancer who presented to the hospital with a
perineal ulcer.  She was noted to be in mild congestive heart
failure on presentation.  She was treated with ciprofloxacin
for a urinary tract infection and covered with cefazolin for
possible infection in the perineum.

She was seen by General Surgery, Plastic Service, and
Gynecology and was planned for surgical intervention with
incision and drainage and a diverting colostomy.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit on [**7-14**] for acute shortness of breath with a primary
metabolic acidosis and secondary respiratory alkalosis.
Examination and chest x-ray were consistent with congestive
heart failure.  The patient was diuresed with Lasix and
placed on nitrates.  She was placed on supplemental oxygen
and received a trial of BiPAP which she was unable to
tolerate.  She was diuresed over 1100 cc over the first day
in the Intensive Care Unit; though this was limited by
concomitant hypotension.

She was evaluated by the Cardiology Service given her severe
dilated cardiomyopathy with congestive heart failure and
hypotension.  They recommended placement of a Swan-Ganz
catheter prior to initiation of tailored therapy.  The
patient continued to be markedly short of breath and
desaturated with increased FIO2 requirements.  She was
electively intubated.

Following intubation, and mechanical ventilation, the patient
continued to do poorly.  Her FIO2 requirements continued to
increase, and she became hypotensive to the 70s.  The patient
was initiated on a Levophed drip.  A left subclavian line was
attempted to be placed with a PA catheter.  This was no
successful.  A follow-up chest x-ray revealed  the patient
had developed a large left-sided tension pneumothorax.  A
needle decompression was performed.

The patient's family was kept informed of the ensuing events
and decided to make the patient comfort measures only given
her overall clinical status and declining quality of life
over the past several years.  A thoracostomy tube was
declined.  The patient's epinephrine drip was weaned to off.
The patient subsequently became hypotensive.

The patient died on [**2140-7-16**] at 12:50 p.m.   Her son,
[**Name (NI) 122**], was present at the bedside at the time of her death.
The family declined a postmortem examination.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Vulvar cancer.
2.  Perineal ulcer.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Severe dilated cardiomyopathy.
6.  Urinary tract infection.
