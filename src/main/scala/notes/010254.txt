HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
male with a history of refractory carcinoma in situ of
bladder first diagnosed in [**2155**].  He had been treated with
three six-week courses of BCG with continuous evidence of
carcinoma in situ.  He had continuous urinary frequency,
pelvic pain, urgency, no dysuria.  In [**2164-11-2**], the
patient had an MRI which showed thickening of the bladder
wall, involvement of potential submucosal layers with
extension to perivesicular fat, severe hydronephrosis on the
left side with a minimal functioning left kidney.  The
patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1) TURBT, 2) Right shoulder surgery,
3) Sinus surgery.

MEDICATION:  1) percocet, 2) Ditropan XL.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Medical imaging salesman, known smoker,
nondrinker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

EXAM:  Pleasant, cooperative, in no acute distress.  Chest
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart - regular rate and
rhythm, no murmurs.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.
No inguinal lymphadenopathy.  GU - normal phallus, meatus and
testes.  No inguinal hernia.  Rectal - 15 gm prostate without
nodularity.

LABS:  BUN and creatinine 19 and 1.0, potassium 4.0,
creatinine clearance 111 cc/min.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2165-1-11**] where radical cystectomy, left radical
nephrectomy was performed.  Neobladder was made.  A Foley
catheter, suprapubic tube, two JPs and right ureteral stent
were placed intraoperatively.  The patient was transfused 2
units of packed red blood cells in the OR.  The operation
went without complications (Please see op note for details.).
The patient was transferred to the unit.

Postoperative day #1 and #2, the patient afebrile, vital
signs stable, slowly weaning off ventilator, good urine
output coming out of right ureteral stent.  Wound was clean,
dry and intact.  The JP outputs sanguineous.  Postop day #3,
the patient was afebrile, vital signs stable.  He was
extubated without complications.  Postop day #4, the patient
was transferred out of the unit to the floor.  He was
afebrile, vital signs stable, pain getting better controlled.
His respiration was improving.  He started to ambulate.  He
received one dose of Toradol.  A repeat chest x-ray showed
significant improvement in pulmonary edema and pleural
effusion.  There was still pleural effusion on the left side.

On postop day #6, the patient was afebrile, vital signs
stable, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, left more than
right.  His NG tube was DC'd without complications.  His
Foley and SP tubes were being flushed with normal saline tid.
 On postop day #7, the patient's epidural was discontinued.
He started on oral pain medication which seemed to be working
well for him.  His stent was removed, after which the patient
started to put out significantly high amounts in the JP
especially on the right side.  It was felt that the patient
had a small anastomotic leak.  The rechecked creatinine
showed increased rise compared to the first few postoperative
days.

Postop day #8, the patient had a fever up to 101.9.  He had a
very high Foley output.  BUN and creatinine continued to
rise.  The renal service was consulted.  It was felt that the
patient's BUN and creatinine rise was probably a combination
of systemic absorption of urine in the peritoneum, as well as
some edema in the ureter post stent removal.  The patient had
an ultrasound performed which showed minimal to mild
hydronephrosis.  The patient had some right-sided back pain.
Postop day #9, the patient's creatinine continued to rise.
He was put on fluid restriction.  Still had some CVA
tenderness to palpation but nothing at rest.  He continued to
ambulate.  His output had changed and he was now mostly
putting out urine out of Foley and JP tube.  There was a
consideration for percutaneous drainage of right kidney due
to acute renal failure; however, on the evening of postop day
#9, the patient's BUN and creatinine started to decline, so
it was decided to hold.

On postop day #10, the patient was afebrile, vital signs
stable.  BUN and creatinine slowly going down.  The patient's
right-sided pain had resolved.  He started to develop a fever
on postop #11.  He had a fever, shortness of breath.  His
saturation dropped to 86-88% on room air.  He had another
chest x-ray which showed evidence of left lower lobe
pneumonia.  Because of a high suspicion, the patient had a VQ
scan which had moderate to high probability of left upper
lobe PE, as well as some filling defects in the right lung.
The respiratory and medicine service were consulted.  The
patient was placed on oxygen, antibiotics and heparin for
anticoagulation.

On postop day #11, the patient was still spiking a fever,
continued on heparin.  He was started on [**Date Range **] for
anticoagulation.  On postop day #12, the patient had a fever
overnight, some right-sided back pain.  His Foley and SP were
irrigated more aggressively and some mucous came out, after
which the patient's symptoms have resolved.  His flushing
regimen was changed to tid plus prn versus qd.  The patient
continued on heparin and [**Date Range **] for anticoagulation.  He
also was growing oxacillin resistant staphylococcus out of
his urine, sensitive to Levofloxacin.  The patient was
continued on levo.

On postop day #13, the patient was afebrile, vital signs,
Foley and SP were draining well (most urine coming out of
Foley).  JP had minimal output.  Left JP was removed without
complications.  The patient was ambulating.  Staples were
removed.  There was a small open which was open and packed
wet-to-dry.  The patient was started on Lovenox.  His heparin
was discontinued.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to home with VNA
for Foley and suprapubic tube flushing and teaching.  Wound
wet-to-dry changes [**Hospital1 **].  Lovenox injections [**Hospital1 **].  [**Hospital1 197**]
check qd.

MEDICATIONS:  1) oxycodone 5 mg 1-2 tabs po q 4-6 h prn, 2)
Levofloxacin 500 mg po qd x 10 days, 3) [**Hospital1 **] 5 mg po qd,
4) colace 100 mg po bid, 5) Dulcolax 10 mg po PR qd prn, 6)
Tylenol 650 mg q 4-6 h prn, 7) Zantac 150 mg po bid, 8)
Lovenox 80 mg po bid.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient should contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**] and Dr.[**Name (NI) 100354**] office for postoperative check.  The patient's INR
results should be phoned to his primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] adjustment.

DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE:  1) Bladder carcinoma.  2) Ureteral
carcinoma.  3) Left hydronephrosis.  4) Status post left
radical nephrectomy, ureterectomy, radical cystectomy,
prostatectomy, neobladder formation, hypokalemia,
hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, pleural effusion, acute renal
