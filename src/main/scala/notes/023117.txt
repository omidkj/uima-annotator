Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Tunneled HD line placement
hemodialysis
PICC placement, PICC removal

History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year-old woman with history of CAD, CHF, copd on
home oxygen, pulm hypertension, polysubstance abuse who
presented to OSH earlier today ([**4-28**]) with altered mental
status. As per records, patient presented after her VNA noted
medical non-compliance and apparent overuse of sedating
medications and summoned EMS. When patient arrived at OSH, the
patient was somewhat confused and hypoxic to high 80's on 3
liters. (Unclear baseline requirement but on home oxygen). Also
tachycardic to 100, tachypneic to mid 20's and hypertensive to
160's. She had low grade fevers to 99. She was felt to be in
congestive heart failure, was noted to have hyperkalemia, and
apparently new renal failure with creatinine in 6's. A central
line was placed but then the patient became agitated,
self-extracted the femoral line. Serial haldol, benadryl and
ativan x3 were not effective in sedating her and therefore the
patient was intubated for airway protection. The femoral line
was replaced. The patient had a NG tube placed, was given
kayxelate, calcium gluconate, bicarb, insulin, and glucose for
hyperkalemia, las well as lasix for CHF. She was given a dose of
levoquin for UTI/possible pneumonia. The patient had an anion
gap acidosis and there was concern for ethylene glycol because
"urate crystals" were noted in the urine.
.
She was noted to have coffee grounds by NGT.
.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER. In our ER, received a
tox consult, renal consult, GI consult and CXR. The CXR
confirmed CHF. Flomipazole was given for possible ethylene
glycol intoxication. Renal recommended: no dialysis, give
bicarb. GI recommended: protonix, ffp and vitamin K. Tox: no
other reccs.
.
Vitamin K 10 subcut, 2 units FFP, protonix, insulin, dextrose,
calcium gluconate, Kaexelate and bicarb given.

[**4-30**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial
effusion.
.
[**5-1**] CT TORSO
IMPRESSION:
1. No bowel obstruction is identified. Small bowel and large
bowel loops appear unremarkable.
2. Bilateral increased interstitial markings and septal
thickening is suggestive of presence of the heart failure. The
heart is also mildly enlarged.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and dependent atelectatic
changes are noted at both lung bases. Infiltrate/infection
cannot be ruled out. Small pericardial effusion is also noted.
4. A 4-mm nodule is noted within the anterior portion of the
right middle lobe. Pathologically enlarged right paratracheal
node measures 13 mm in the short axis.
5. Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
6. The aorta demonstrates severe stenosis below the renal
arteries. No aneurysmal dilatation is noted.
7. Small right kidney with normal sized left kidney. No
hydronephrosis or stones are identified.
.
[**5-1**] CT HEAD
1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Chronic infarcts in the right cerebellum and centrum
semiovale.
3. Sinus disease involving left maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
.
[**5-2**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of
probable
periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges (i.e., PLEDs)
involving
the right hemisphere which could indicate a subcortical
abnormality
involving this area. The presence of a diffusely slow background
and
disorganized background is consistent with a mild to moderate
encephalopathy of toxic, anoxic, or metabolic etiology. The
occasional
sharp waves can be a sign of cortical irritability, but clinical

correlation would need to be provided. No evidence for ongoing
seizures
is seen.
.
[**5-19**] ECHO/Bubble study:
Focused study to assess for patent foramen ovale. Images were
obtained at
rest, with cough and post-valsalva release with injection of
agitated saline.
No evidence for an atrial septal defect or patent
