Allergies:
Phenytoin / Decadron

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
Meningioma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2188-8-20**]: Left Craniotomy for Meningioma with reconstruction
[**2188-8-31**]: G-tube placement

History of Present Illness:
76-year-old male with history of recurrent meningioma s/p
bifrontal craniotomy with cranioplasty and bone flap [**2188-8-21**],
transferred from TICU for further management of post-operative
atrial fibrillation. Patient has baseline sinus bradycardia and
underwent ablation after presentation with tachyarrythmia on
[**2188-7-16**]. Patient unable to give history.

Past Medical History:
1. Atypical Reccurent Right Frontal Meningioma: Symptoms began
in [**2180-6-22**] per [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 38984**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] "when he became forgetful and
sluggish. Initially he was treated for depression. A head MRI
showed a large dura-based mass in the right frontal brain. A
resection was done by [**Name6 (MD) 1528**] Cares, MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 38994**]. Pathology was atypical meningioma. He did well until
[**10-22**] when the mass recurred. He had a second resection on
[**2182-1-9**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38985**]. This was followed with involved-field
cranial irradiation by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 38986**], MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 **]
from [**Month (only) **] to [**2182-3-22**] to 5760 cGy. A follow up MRI on [**2183-6-26**]
showed a 0.5-mm dural based nodular enhancement and he was
referred here for SRS. Surveillance MRI on [**2184-12-8**] revealed
growth of the meningioma in the superior margin of the surgical
cavity invading the skull. He underwent craniectomy on [**2185-1-26**]
by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 38987**]. There had been invasion
into the inner and outer tables of the skull. A piece of Duagen
dural substitute was placed over the dural defect and then
Methyl Methacrylate cranioplasty was placed over the skull
defect. Pathology revealed atypical meningioma." Underwent
cyberknife therapy in [**2-27**]. He has been maintained on temodar
(chemo) 25mg/m2.
2. Atrial fibrillation: Known to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16958**].
3. GERD
4. OA of knee
5. Hypothyroid


Social History:
Married with two children. Used to smoke a pack a day but quit
in [**2151**]. Used to drink beer but stopped when he was put on
Coumadin. Mother died at 80 from stroke. Father died at 60's,
unclear cause. Bother died 60 from lung cancer.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Gen: elderly male in NAD. Oriented x 1. Mood, affect
appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
CV: Regular rate, normal S1, S2. No m/r/g. No thrills, lifts. No
S3 or S4.
Chest: Resp were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. Poor air
flow bases bilateral. No wheezes or crackles.
Abd: Soft, NTND. PEG tube inplace. No HSM or tenderness.
Ext: No c/c/e.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars.

Pertinent Results:
[**2188-8-22**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2188-7-15**], the findings are similar.
.
Head CT [**2188-8-31**]:  Multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhage
centered within the right frontal lobe with surrounding edema is
relatively unchanged when compared to prior exam. A small amount
of extra-axial hemorrhage along the right frontal craniotomy is
stable in appearance as well. Areas of pneumocephalus near the
right frontal craniotomy mesh is persistent. There is no shift
of normally midline structures. The ventricle configuration is
unchanged. Hypodensity in the periventricular and subcortical
white matter reflects chronic microvascular and vascular
ischemic changes. Secretions in the right frontal sinus is
unchanged.
.
MRI [**2188-8-22**]: Status post interval resection of right frontal
scalp mass and the contiguous extra-axial enhancing lesions.
There is stable enhancing heterogeneous tissue in the inferior
right frontal lobe. There are findings suggestive of ischemia in
the right frontal lobe which is new compared to the prior study
of [**2188-8-21**]. There is a new mesh cranioplasty in the right
frontal region.

Labs on Discharge:


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was electively admitted on [**8-21**] for a planned surgical
resection and esthetic reconstruction of his left cranium for
recurrent meningioma.  On admission, his coagulation studies
were elevated, requiring the use of FFP infusion and vitamin K
infusion to correct prior to surgery.  This was done
uneventfully, and surgery proceded. Intraoperatively, he had
several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response, which was refractory to cardioversion. He also
underwent an intraoperative TEE for further interrogation of
this process.  Post-operatively, he was admitted to the ICU for
this reason, and cardiology consulted for control of his atrial
fibrillation he was started on an Amiodarone drip and Diltiazem
drips which eventually converted him. He remained abulic,
followed commands inconsistently and answered in one word
answers.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: On [**8-27**] he was transferred to the step
down unit. On [**8-27**]: Back into afib on Esmolol. On [**8-29**]: amio 200
[**Hospital1 **], LFTs wnl; back in afib. Lopressor 37.5mg PO BID. On [**2188-8-29**],
patient was transferred from trauma SICU to medicine cardiology
service. On arrival, he was in atrial fibrillation with RVR. Per
cardiology recs, he was given acebutolol 200mg via the NG tube.
Overnight, patient pulled out his NG tube. Given that he had
failed swallow studies twice in the previous week, he was not
able to take any medications by mouth. Plan was to give patient
IV beta-blockers as needed until a PEG tube was placed. On the
morning of [**2188-8-30**], patient was given metoprolol IV 5mg x1 for
atrial flutter with heart rate in 130s. Patient converted back
to sinus rhythm. On [**2188-9-1**] patient re-entered A Fib with RVR.
Patient was started on Acebutolol, Amiodarone 100mg qd and
digoxin 0.125mg. Metoprolol was not started as patient become
bradycardiac last time he converted. However, patient did not
convert with Acebutolol titrated up to 400mg [**Hospital1 **] consequently we
started Metoprolol. Patient converted on [**2188-9-6**] when titrated
to Metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **]. No significant pauses or brady on
conversion. Patient recently had ablation in [**6-29**]. Pacemaker
placement not an ideal option as patient will require multiple
MRI for meningioma resection follow-up.
