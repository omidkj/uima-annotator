65 yo f w/ h/o copd a/w hypoxia and lethargy, found to have UTI
and b/l cellulitis.  Was in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for 4 days and became more
alert with antibiotic treatment.
.
1) Hypoxia with hypercapnia- now at baseline O2 sat.  Likely was
combination oversedation and mild COPD flare.  Pt received a few
days doses of prednisone (4) and covered on antibiotics for
flare.  No clear indication of PNA.  Continue outpatient advair
and albuterol prn for treatment of COPD.  Attempt to avoid
oversedation with pain medications.
.
2) UTI- Proteus mirabalis with resistance.  Has received 6 days
of appropriate antibiotics and would benefit from a full 10 days
course.  Foley has been left in as patient having difficulty
getting to bathroom and wanted to avoid contaminating leg
wounds.
-remove foley on return to [**Hospital1 1501**]

unclear if will be as potassium wasting.
