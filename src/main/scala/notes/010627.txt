Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10063**] was admitted from the ED on [**2-18**] and went for EVAR
that evening. He tolerated the procedure well and he was
recovered in the PACU where he was monitored closely.  He
remained stable and was transfered to the VICU where he was
monitored closely. On POD 1 he complained of back pain, which he
had previously complained about for 2 weeks prior.  Neurosurgery
was consulted and felt an MRI would be worthwhile, but the pt
was not a candidate for this given his stent placement. He was
recommended to work with PT and to f/u in the outpatient
neurosurgery clinic if needed. He continued to have back pain
and on [**2-20**] at CTA abd/pelvis was done to eval his EVAR stent,
and r/o endoleak.  The scan was negative for endoleak and showed
a normal post op appearance of the stent. On [**2-21**] Mr. [**Known lastname 10063**]
had some abdominal pain and distention with decreased bowel
sounds. A KUB showed an ileus. He had an ngt placed and was
successfully decompressed. On [**2-22**] another KUB showed
significant improvement. A f/u KUB on [**2-24**] showed complete
resolution of the ileus. On [**2-24**] he tolerated a regular diet and
ambulated independently.  He initially had difficulty voiding
after his foley was removed, but flomax was started and a second
voiding trial was successful.  By [**2-25**] he was completely
independent, walking with a cane for support. He was feeling
well and his labs were stable. He was discharged home with
family.
