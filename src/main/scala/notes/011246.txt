Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Obstructed CBD requiring ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP on [**2153-6-28**]: Moderate diffuse dilation in common bile duct.
Unable to visualize specific filling defect or stone. Stent
placed, with patent flow.


History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with ESRD on HD, COPD, CHF, DM, pna with tracheostomy in
place who is transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital ICU for ERCP.
After protracted hospital course [**1-10**] bacteremia/pna/uti, pt
developed RUQ tenderness on [**6-11**].  At that time, LFTs elevated.
RUQ U/S showed sludge in gallbladder.  Pt underwent
cholecystostomy tube placement for gallbladder decompression.
Subsequent HIDA scan showed no flow into duodenum indicating
obstruction. Cholangiogram through cholecystostomy showed
obstructed common bile duct. CT scan showed no tumor but
possible worsening common bile duct dilation.  T Bili 11.6, D
Bili 7.4, Alk Phos 300 ([**6-26**]), AST and ALT normal at 53 and 12
day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**6-27**]), trending up.
.
Of note, pt admitted to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital on [**2153-5-13**] and was
eventually diagnosed with Klebsiella + MRSA pneumonia, Klebs UTI
+ Klebs bacteremia.  Coded [**5-17**] (hypotensive, bradycardic) - was
rescusitated and intubated, placed on neosynephrine.  Was found
to have cecal volvulus . [**5-30**] found to have blood cx+ for
Klebsiella, [**Female First Name (un) **], pseudomonas.  Also with VRE in bile
(cholecystostomy tube).  With episodes of tachycardia +
hypotensions, controlled on Diltiazem gtt.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77yo man w/ PMH ESRD on HD, COPD, CHF, DM, bacteremia, pna
w/ trach, transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital with evidence of
obstruction in CBD for ERCP to be performed [**6-28**].
.
1.) CBD Dilatation:  Pt transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital for
ERCP on [**6-28**]. There was evidence of CBD obstruction via HIDA
scan and cholangiogram through his cholecystostomy tube, and he
also had clinical evidence of cholangitis and rising LFTs in
obstructive pattern @ OSH. No evidence of mass on CT. He was
kept NPO over night and had an ERCP in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**6-28**] which
found moderate diffuse dilation in the common bile duct, but not
definitive stones or filling defects were seen. A 10Fx9cm Cotton
[**Doctor Last Name **] plast stent was placed. The pancreatic duct was not
cannulated. He tolerated the procedure well and remained in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] overnight for observation. He was transferred back to
[**Hospital 8**] Hospital in the morning of [**6-29**].
.
2.) Bacteremia/pneumonia/UTI/cholangitis:  Pt was continued on
the broad spectrum antibiotics he was on at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital
(Zosyn and Linezolid). No further dose of amikacin was given as
he had received one dose prior to arrival in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Plans
for amikacin re-dose after dialysis @ [**Hospital 8**] Hospital on
[**6-29**].
.
3.) Hypotension: He continued to require neosynephrine for BP
support, with the goal being to keep MAP >60. SBPs were
maintained in the 100-120s. He was also continued on
dexamethasone 2mg [**Hospital1 **] for suspected underlying adrenal
insufficiency. Fluid boluses were not given [**1-10**] oliguric state.
.
4.) Respiratory failure:  Pt remained on the same vent settings
AC/550x20/0.4/5. O2 sats remained between 96-100% while in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
5.) ESRD on HD: Nephrocaps and renagel were held [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital requests. Pt's last HD was on [**6-27**] prior to transfer
and will receive his next scheduled HD on [**6-29**] upon his return
to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital.
.
6.) DM: On RISS, with FS 86-154.
.
7.) Seizure disorder: His PO dose of dilantin was given IV as
patient was NPO for the ERCP.
.
8.) CHF: Pt had no issues with CHF while admitted here. His O2
sats remained stable and there were no signs/sxs of pulmonary
congestion/fluid overload
.
9.) CAD: Continued to hold his betablocker, ASA, and stain [**1-10**]
to his current medical problems (hypotension, GI bleed, and
elevated LFTs).
.
10.) A Fib: He was continued on Diltiazem gtt for HR control,
with a goal HR of <120. He was not anticoagulated [**1-10**] heparin
allergy.
.
11.) COPD:  He was continued on Albuterol/Atrovent nebs (for
vent) and dexamethasone IV (for suspected adrenal
insufficiency).
.
12.) Chronic Lower GI Bleed: During his stay, there were no
signs/sx of acute blood loss and no evidence of blood in his
stool.
.
13.) FEN: TPN held as patient was only here for one day and
there were not enough ports available to deliver TPN and his
medications/gtt. His electrolytes were monitored and were stable
compared to his labs from the OSH.
.
14.) PPX: On PPI [**Hospital1 **] (for GI bleed, steroids) and pneumoboots
(not on heparin [**1-10**] to heparin allergy).
.
15.) Access: No further lines placed here. Pt had L IJ, R
subclavian dialysis cath, and cholecystostomy tube placed at
OSH.
.
16.) Code status: Full
.
17.) Dispo: Returning to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital ICU.
