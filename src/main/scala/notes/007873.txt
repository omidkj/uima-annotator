Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Niacin / Latex / Formaldehyde

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterizaiton


History of Present Illness:
 [**Age over 90 **] Y F w/ hx of HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD s/p NSTEMI x2 in past 3
months, medically managed, systolic CHF w/ EF 25% s/p biV ICD,
and hx of GI bleed last year on ASA re-presented to [**Location (un) **] on
[**2163-3-27**] with recurrent SOB in acute CHF and NSTEMI. At [**Name (NI) **] pt
had another NSTEMI complicated by CHF exacerbation. Pt is
DNR/DNI and had previously not wanted an intervention but after
discussion with her physicians at [**Location (un) **] she agreed to reverse
her status to perform cardiac cath. She was transferred here for
cath on [**2163-4-1**] which showed the LAD had a 90% proximal stenosis
and a 90% distal stenosis; the D1 had a 70% lesion. The LCX
system had a small OM1 with 90% stenosis. The RCA was a small
vessel totally occluded in its distal portion. Successful
multivessel PCI of proximal and distal LAD and OM1 with bare
metal stents (2.0 X 23 mm X 2.0 X 12 mm Vision stents to distal
LAD and 2.0 X 18 mm Vision stent to proximal LAD postdilated to
2.5; 3.5 X 15 mm Vision stent to the OM with 3.5 X 12 mm kissing
balloon inflation in the LCX and OM1).
.
On the floor post-procedure, she was maintained on metoprolol,
lisinopril, atorvastatin, ASA, and Plavix. Her lisinopril was
titrated down on [**2163-4-2**] because of systolic blood pressure in
80s,at which time she also required a 250cc IVF bolus. Her
furosemide was held at this point given hypotension. She had a
HCT drop from 37 to 31 from [**4-1**] to [**4-2**], down to 29 on the
afternoon of [**4-2**]. Groin U/S nl and pelvic CT read pending.
.
On the day of transfer to the CCU team, she complained of
abdominal pain/tightness consistent with her anginal equivalent.
On the evening of transfer, she became acutely hypoxic with sats
to the mid 80's requiring a non-rebreather. Her SBP was in the
150s. ABG done showed 7.34/45/126. She was in acute respiratory
distress and uncomfortable, moaning in pain. Her exam had
wheezing and bronchospasm. Nebs were given and this improved.
ECG showed possible precordial ST elevations possibly changed
from baseline. CXR showed increase in vascular congestion. She
was given IV lasix 40mg x 2 and 2mg morphine IV. The cardiology
fellow came immediately and the attending was consulted.
Meanwhile, Nitro gtt, Morphine IV were initiated, as well as
heparin gtt. Labs were drawn which showed a slight elevation in
troponin from previous (0.43 from 0.36) but flat CK and CK/MB.
Discussions with the daughter about code status concluded
continued DNR/DNI with possible reversal if catheterization was
considered necessary. She is now being transferred for closer
observation to the CCU team.
.
After transfer, she reports improvement in symptoms. She has at
this point diureses 165cc from the IV lasix. She denies chest
pain/pressure, abdominal pain/pressure, shortness of breath, LH.

Cadiac cath ([**2163-4-1**]): 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated an LMCA without angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had a 90% proximal stenosis and a 90%
distal stenosis; the D1 had a 70% lesion. The LCX system had a
small OM1 with 90% stenosis. The RCA was a small vessel totally
occluded in its distal portion. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics
revealed pulmonary hypertension and elevated right heart filling
pressures. 3. Successful multivessel PCI of proximal and distal
LAD and OM1 with bare metal stents.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of LAD and OM1 with bare metal stents.
.
Echo ([**2163-4-4**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is an apical
left ventricular aneurysm. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal akinesis, apical
dyskinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular focal dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] Y F w/ hx of HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD s/p NSTEMI x2 in past 3
months, medically managed, CHF w/ EF 25% s/p biV ICD, and hx of
GI bleed last year on ASA re-presented to [**Location (un) **] on [**2163-3-27**] with
recurrent SOB in acute CHF and [**Hospital 7792**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cath on [**3-31**].
PCI here with right dominant system, LMCA without
angiographically apparent disease, 90% proximal stenosis and a
90% distal stenosis of the LAD; the D1 had a 70% lesion. The LCX
system had a small OM1 with 90% stenosis. The RCA was a small
vessel totally occluded in its distal portion. Pt had BMS to
proximal and distal LAD and OM1.   Limited resting hemodynamics
revealed pulmonary hypertension and elevated right heart filling
pressures that improved s/p intervention (wedge high 20's to
teens after intervention).
On [**2163-4-2**], she was mildly hypotensive in the 80's, at which
time she was given a 250cc bolus.  On [**2163-4-3**] in the early
morning, she complained of abdominal pain and tightness which
were consistent with her anginal equivalent. She became
hypertensive to the 150's systolic. She was started on a nitro
drip, morphine IV, and heparin drip but troponins were slightly
elevated (but flat CK/MB). She was transferred to the CCU for
monitoring where she was diuresed and again, she be
