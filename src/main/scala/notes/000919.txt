History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87545**] is an 81 yo M with PMH CAD s/p CABG in [**2125**], ICD
placed in [**2142**] for ischemic cardiomyopathy, recently admitted in
[**7-/2145**] for fascicular VT s/p lidocaine and sent home on
amiodarone, who presents with syncope, fall, and AMS. Pt's
family notes that patient has been falling lately, thought to be
secondary to leg weakness. Has been acting "out-of-it" lately
and almost "drunk-like". Yesterday he fell and hurt his arm but
did not seek medical care. Today, he was "out-of-it" in presence
of daughter, who helped him sit down and then called EMS. There
was no observed LOC. Pt was intubated at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for
obtundation and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]. During transport, pt had
what looked like VT in ambulance (no strip available), he was
given 100mg Lidocaine IV, and Kayexalate 30mg for K+ 6.5. He is
currently AV paced at 60 BPM.
Head and torso CT done at [**Location (un) 620**] showed no pathology, L arm
noted to be significantly bruised (on plavix). In ED, vitals
were HR 60, BP 106/47, CMV asst mode, afebrile. Pt had neg CXR
and UA. K+ was 5.4 and Cr increased from 0.9 baseline to 2.0.
For hyperkalemia, pt received 8 units of insulin, amp of d50,
and 1 amp of calcium gluconate. Trop was elevated at 0.09, CK
107, MB 6- elevated trop was attributed to his renal
insuficiency.  He was given rectal ASA.  An Xray of left arm
eccymosis showed contrast extravasation into hand on left side
(from IV site). Plastics saw pt in ED and recommended ace
bandage. Pt has a right femoral a-line in place.

Imaging:

Left humerus X-ray
These two exams consist of AP and oblique views of left humerus
and left
forearm. Extensive changes in the soft tissues, probably relate
to overlying bandage with suboptimal assessment. Marked
generalized demineralization. No fracture identified although
this assessment not ideal and I have no localizing history.
Carpus is inadequately assessed with apparent irregularity of
the carpal navicular bone. Incidental pulse generator in the
partially visualized tissues of the left hemithorax. The
acromiohumeral soft tissues are probably diminished consistent
with rotator cuff attenuation.

IMPRESSION: No fracture.

Knee X-ray

AP and lateral cross-table views left knee. There is
satisfactorily
positioned three-part total knee prosthesis without evidence of
loosening (no comparison radiographs at this facility). There is
considerable soft tissue swelling about the knee particularly
anteriorly in relationship to the patellar tendon. No fracture
or bone destruction. A small suprapatellar effusion is present
(I doubt the presence of fat-fluid level although this is
suboptimally assessed). Vascular calcifications.

IMPRESSION: No fracture identified.

Chest X-ray
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema with small left pleural
effusion.
Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis, but developing
infection
cannot be excluded. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tubes in
standard
positions.

Echo:
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD (PDA distribution). Moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery hypertension. Compared with the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2145-8-9**], the findings are similar.

CT Head:
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute intracranial process.

2. No CT evidence of incracranial mass. Note MRI with gadolinium
is more
sensitive for small mass if not contraindicated.

3. Age-related involution and mild, if any underlying small
vessel ischemic
disease.

CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral small-to-moderate loculated pleural effusions, with
adjacent
atelectasis. Cannot exclude superimposed infectious process.

2. No lung masses. No mediastinal, hilar or axillary
lymphadenopathy.

3. Marked cardiomegaly. Dual chamber ICD. No significant
pericardial
effusion.

4. Markedly tortuous and moderately calcified descending aorta.
Significant
coronary artery disease

Discharge Labs:


Brief Hospital Course:
81 y.o. M history of CAD, CHF with AICD placed, recent admission
for VT s/p home amiodarone therapy, who is admitted for
possible syncopal episode, altered mental status, and acute
renal failure.

#. RHYTHM: Given recent hospitalization for VT, there was
initial concern that his event was secondary to an underlying
arrhtymia. Pt came to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated and was transfered to the
CCU. EP consult interrogated pacer and found that patient had
not been in V. Tach and was unlikely the source of his
presenting symptoms. He was continued on his home daily
amiodarone medication while inpatient. On the morning of
[**2145-10-25**], he had a 15-beat run of tachyarrhythmia that resolved
spontaneously. Mr. [**Known lastname 87545**] was asymptomatic throughout the
episode. His metroprolol was increased from 25mg [**Hospital1 **] to 25mg TID
for better rhythm control.
.
#. Syncope/Fall/AMS: Unclear if this episode involved any LOC.
Per family, pt has been in his usual state of health ([**Location (un) 1131**] 3
newspapers a day, lucid, no memory impairment) and around 1 week
prior to admission has been acting different. Further discussion
with his son [**Name (NI) 87546**] that he has had prior issues with self
medication management and it is unclear if he has been using
narcotic pain medicine for back pain. Infectious etiology workup
was unrevealing, urine and blood cx negative. PPD was negative.
Home gabapentin therpay was held while inpatient. Geriatricas
was consulted and they agreed that polypharmacy was a possible
eitology of his AMS . A Urine drug tox was negative. The most
likely etiology of his AMS is benadryl a
