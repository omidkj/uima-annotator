Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart catheterization
pleurocentesis


History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 62 year old male w/ hx of NSTEMI, HIV (CD4 <
200) not on therapy, DMII, CKD, cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), Burkitt
Lymphoma and Hodgkin's (relapsed) who presents with failure to
thrive. Pt with a week of right sided chest pain under breast
intermittently, not associated w/ exertion. Does not radiate.
Feels like a shock in quality. Lasts for minutes at a time
(usually < 5 min). No chest pain currently and has not been
present for 48hrs. No clear pleuritic component. No hemoptysis.
No calf pain.
.
Pt went to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 438**] with cough at the end of [**Month (only) 956**], with
suspicion of PNA (vs. pulm edema) based upon exam and CXR.  Pt
was treated w/ levofloxacin for one week.  The patient brought
the prescription with him, but not sure he took it every day.
Pt states that he has had "weakness" for the past week as well,
and states he has not been able to walk to the door (although
denies that the symptoms were secondary to dyspnea).  The
patient states he has had loose stools for the past five days,
and last had a loose BM in the ED.  The patient explains that he
sometimes gets confused with his medications, and has not taken
his lasix or other medications every day.  The patient sleeps
with 1-2 pillows at night, and has no trouble sleeping flat
without pillows. The patient denies PND. The patient still
reports a cough periodically. Pt has had a poor appetite in the
past week.
.
Hx of CHF with LVEF < 20% on last ECHO in [**2139**]. No CAD he knows
of, but hx of NSTEMI in [**2139**] per OMR. No history of blood clots.

.
In the ED, initial vs were:97.8 88 118/88 18 99%.
EKG: 90, sinus, T wave inversions in V2-5, st-t downsloping;
slightly more pronounced from prior.
CXR demonstrated moderate right pleural effusion increased
compared to prior, likely with subpulmonic component with
consolidation at right lung base, pulmonary congestion.
Labs demonstrated troponin negative x1, BNP (7300) elevated from
prior (5000 in [**8-/2140**]), hx range (3K-7K). Lactate 2.1. Cr 1.8
(b/l 1.3-1.9). Hct 33.8 (from b/l 32). INR 1.5.  LFTs abnl (ALT
319  AST 258 AP 289).
Pt received 750mg IV levoquin and 1L IVF.
Vitals on transfer:  98 84 22 BP 98/70
Pt admitted for chest pain.
.
Review of sytems: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache,
vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, BRBPR, melena,
hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

[**2142-2-1**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Quantitative (3D) LVEF = 22%. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular volume overload. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Pulmonary pressures
are likely elevated, but cannot be estimated reliably because of
moderate to severe TR. Appearance of right ventricle suggests
that the RV stroke work index is abnormal. There is a small
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe global biventricular systolic dysfunction
with markedly depressed forward stroke volume. Mild aortic and
mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-9**],
estimated cardiac output is lower. Right ventricle is larger and
RV systolic function is further depressed.

[**2142-2-1**] CATH:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right
and
left-sided filling pressures with RVEDP 25mm Hg, mean PCWP 34mm
Hg.
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with mean PA 40mmHg
secondary
to elevated left-sided pressures with a transpulmonary gradient
of
6mmHg.  There was marked respiratory variability throughout
tracings.
2. Severely depressed cardiac output with cardiac index 1.21
with
arterial O2 saturation by pulse oximetry 97% on room air and PA
O2
saturation of 30%.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Cardiogenic shock with marked elevation in right and left
heart
