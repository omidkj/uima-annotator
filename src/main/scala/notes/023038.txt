History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 88 year-old right-handed man well known to me from
his last admission on [**2-8**]. He was discharged yesterday.
Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 27271**] has a PMH of a recent SDH, afib off
coumadin, HTN, HLD and a recent admission for transient weakness
and difficulty producing speech lasting 20 minute. During his
most recent admission he was evaluated for these episodes with
an EEG which showed some drowsiness but no focality. He also had
a CTV which did not show any venous thrombosis and carotid
Dopplers which showed bilateral 60~69% stenosis. An echo was
also done which showed mild LVH and an EF of 50~55%.

During this hospitalization he was found to have a slightly
subtherapeutic Tegretol level of 3.5 therefore his dose was
increased to 300mg daily from 200. His hospital course was
otherwise notable for mild hyponatremia (132), an A1c of 5.8 and
an LDL of 72. In regards to his afib, he was restarted on
aspirin
and coumadin was to be considered at his follow-up appointment.
He was discharged to rehab.

Today, Mr. [**Known lastname 27271**] was at rehab when he had an episode of right
face, arm, and leg hemiparesis and dysarthria. The onset abrupt
around 9am. Per EMS records his BP was 183/102 HR 79-108 and his
BS was 129. O2 sats were 99% on RA No LOC or limb movements were
noted. He was taken to an OSH where a head CT was done which
showed the stable subdural. His BP threr ranged in the 180's SB
and 70-100's for the DB.  His screening labs showed a negative
UA, no leukocytosis and an INR of 1.0. Of note, his Na was 130,
Cr of 0.98 and a troponin of 0.4.   The episode resolved about
90 minutes later in the ED. He was transferred here for further
care. Mr. [**Known lastname 27271**] described the event as a "funny feeling" in his
chest, lightheadedness and then feeling "weak in parts" but does
not identify his arm or face as being involved. He does recall
that his speech was "garbled" and that his words would come out
but were not easy to understand. He was able to understand
others without difficulty. He feels that the episode lasted
about 40
minutes.

CT HEAD pre-operation:
1. Stable left frontoparietal subdural hematoma, subacute on
chronic. No new hemorrhage is identified.

2. Stable mass effect. No herniation identified.

3. Stable chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic
changes. Mild
diffuse parenchymal volume loss.

CT HEAD post-opeartion: Status post partial evacuation of left
subdural collection via left burr holes, with expected
postoperative changes and with decreased mass efect on the
subjacent left frontoparietal brain and the left lateral
ventricles. Small subdural collection remains, mainly along the
superior convexity, where it is isodense. No evidence of new
hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is an 88 year-old RH man with a complex PMH including
seizures, CAD and afib off coumadin, recent traumatic SDH and
very recent admission for transient difficulty
producing speech and R hand weakness. He now presents with a
similar episode although the symptoms were more extensive
involving right face, arm, and leg hemiparesis and dysarthria.
The duration of symptoms is also longer and he now has a L
facial droop. The remainder of his exam is stable.

Given the recurrence of his symptoms for over an hour, seizure
is less likely and there was more concern of the mass effect
from his SDH hence he was evaluated per neurosurgery. Cardiology
consult cleared him for the operation. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]
performed the left-sided burr hole craniotomy for evacuation of
the symptomatic left SDH without complication. Post-op imaging
showed expected post surgical changes.

Given his risk factors including CAD and Afib, aspirin 81mg was
started the next morning and he remained symptom free including
speech and R arm weakness for the remainder of the admission.
He was re-evalauted per PT who recommended returning to rehab
for inpatient physical therapy and he is, once again discharged
to [**Hospital 5130**] Rehab for acute therapy.

He is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (neurology) on
[**2190-3-15**] 2:30pm at [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Center [**Location (un) 858**]. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
neurosurgery, the patient should not restart Coumadin until 3
months after the left SDH evacuation. The patien
