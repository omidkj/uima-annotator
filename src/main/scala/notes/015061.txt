Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
c/c:  sepsis, gallstone pancreatitis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP on [**7-18**].

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with a history of renal cell CA s/p nephrectomy with lung
mets s/p lobectomy transferred from OSH with sepsis,
trasaminitis, pancreatitis, concerning for gallstone
pancreatitis.  Patient originally presented to [**Location (un) 620**] ED the
previous evening with sudden onset of epigastric pain and chest
pain which radiated to the left axillar.  The pain was sharp in
nature and she had chills.  At [**Location (un) 620**] she was found to have
elevated LFTs, elevated amylase and lipase.  A chest/abdominal
CT showed possible pancreatitis changes but limited exam, with
CBD at 7 cm, along with a hiatal hernia, and acute pulmonary
abnormalities.  She was initially placed on levoflox and flagyl.
 She subsequently had [**5-1**] blood cultures with gram negative
bacilli and some gram positive cocci.  Her antibiotics were
broadened to include levoflox, flagyl, zosyn, and vanco.  At
admission, her SBP was in the 120s, but overnight dropped to the
80s systolic.  She was treated with IV fluids to maintain her BP
which held stable with SBPs in the 80s.  A femoral TLC was
attempted unsuccessfully.  She continued to mentate with good
urine output, and receivced total of ~5 liters of IVF overnight.
 On the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], her LFTs and amylase/lipase
rose dramatically.  She had a right subclavian line placed by
Surgery.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and possible ERCP.  Patient is without any
complaints.  Denied abdominal pain at present, no n/v/d or f/c.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with history of renal cell CA, COPD, PVD here with sepsis,
enzymes suggestive of pancreatitis, most likely gallstone vs.
other causes of cholestasis also with possible cholangitis given
elevated LFTs.  Pt was transferred from an outside hospital to
the Medical ICU on [**7-18**]. Pt's status deteriorated the morning
of [**7-19**], progressive lethargy & obtundation and acidosis.
Following extensive discussion with the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare
proxy, clearly indicating that the patient did not want
intubation/mechanical ventilation and heroic measures, focus of
care shifted to comfort as primary goal.  Patient was made CMO
and expired.  Healthcare proxy was present.

1. Sepsis ?????? Upon admission, OSH microbiology data showed gram
negative rod bacteremia and few GPCs. Presumed source was GI
tract, with cholangitis, pancreatitis. Pt had been fluid
resusiciated for hypotension (asymptomatic) at the outside
hospital but, per report, did have persistently low blood
pressures (ranging 70-80 systolic) that eventually responded to
IVFs. She was hemodynamically stable at ariival, with lactate of
0.9, suggesting adequate resusication however became hypotensive
post ERCP so was given additional IVF per sepsis protocol.
Consyntropin stim test showed inadequate response so pt was
started on stress dose steroids (fludrocort and hydrocort).
Patient was continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics ?????? levoflox,
Zosyn, & vanco. Patient was briefly placed on Levophed for a MAP
<60 but this was discontinued after family meeting and decision
was made to make patient comfort-measures-only.

2. Pancreatitis/Cholangitis/Cholestasis ?????? Patient with
obstructive cholangitis per labs, also with pancreatitis,
concerning for gallstone pancreatitis versus acute pancreatitis.
OSH CT showed normal CBD, but her clinical picture was
concerning for obstructing gallstone. Repeat U/S here showed no
ductal dilatation. ERCP was attempted on [**7-18**] but the
specialists were unable to visualize the papilla so this
procedure was stopped. Pt was continued on IVF and antibiotics
as above.
