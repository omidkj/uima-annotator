Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by
transesophageal echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed), the overall
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old Male with Congestive Heart Failure (LVEF 40%),
Coronary Artery Disease status post Percutaneous angioplasty of
the Left Circumflex and Left Anterior Descending arteries in
[**2167**], Drug Eluding Stent x3 to the Left Anterior Descending in
[**5-/2184**], dyslipidemia, Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Atrial
Fibrillation on coumadin, s/p pacemaker [**2179**] presented to
outside hospital with unstable angina and positive stress test.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catherization which showed 3
vessel CAD. Preop work up was  completed and on  [**9-2**] he
underwent Coronary bypass grafting x4(Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery, and
reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery,
and reverse saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal
artery with a Y-graft to the diagonal artery) with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cross
Clamp time:94 minutes. Please see operative report for further
surgical details. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated in  stable
condition. He awoke neurologically intact and was extubated the
following day. His respiratory status remained somewhat
concerning with bronchospasm evident. He was placed on inhalers
and nebulizer treatments. Inotropes were weaned off and then
ultimately restarted for support. He was gently diuresed toward
his preop weight. When inotropes were weaned off, Beta
blockade/statin/Aspirin were initiated. All lines and drains
were discontinued per protocol. He was transferred to the
stepdown unit on POD #5 to begin increasing his activity level.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. PICC placed for access. Coumadin restarted for his
chronic A Fib. The remainder of his postoperative course was
essentially uneventful. He developed a right leg cellulitis at
his vein harvest site and was started on Vancomycin for this
reason.  He remained afebrile and WBC was 6.6 at discharge.  His
left PICC was removed with some erythema at the insertion site
and a new right sided PICC was placed on [**9-13**].  His respiratory
status slowly improved and he was weaned off supplemental
oxygen. On POD 12 he was discharged to home with VNA. All follow
up appointments were advised.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5686**] will continue to
follow the patient's INR and manage coumadin.
