Chief Complaint:
abdominal distention and pain

Pericardial tap and drain placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11182**] is a 44yo M with h/o HTN, OSA, and asthma, recently
discharged from CT surgical service where he was treated for a
LLL PNA/parapneumonic effusion and empyema s/p bronch,
decortication, and chest tube also with incidentally found
pericardial effusion, seen by Cardiology, thought to be related
to PNA and para-pneumonic effusion who now presents to ED w/
worsening abdominal distention and pain. Of note patient was
treated for pneumonia with levaquin initially but was broadened
to zosyn for better GNR coverage and discharged on Augmentin
which he is still currently taking. His course was also
complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and continued
hypoxia for which he was discharged on supplemental O2.

His current presentation is described as Nausea and vomiting x5
starting evening prior to admission, he also noted worsening
SOB. Patient reports chills last night when nausea and vomiting
started. Last BM this afternoon was loose; has only had two BMs
in past week which is unusual for him.

In the ED, PE: pulsus of 16 by doppler, decreased breath sounds
on L compared to R, pt not able to tolerate lying flat, RRR,
softly distended, hypoactive BS, not TTP. Initial vitals were
98.0 92 133/83 18 99%. CT chest/abd showed increased size of
pericardial effusion and persistent empyema.

Patient was sent directly to Cath lab from ED where a
pericardiocentesis was performed and 750cc of serosanguinous
fluid was removed. Post-pericardiocentesis course complicated by
severe 10/10 chest pain and atrial fibrillation with RVR.

On arrival to the CCU, patient tachycardic to 115 in atrial
fibrillation, BP 137/90 and patient in [**11-5**] chest pain. Patient
given 30mg IV Ketorolac x1 on arrival to CCU.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11182**] is a 44 year old man with hx of HTN, OSA, and asthma,
recently discharged from CT surgical service where he was
treated for a LLL PNA/parapneumonic effusion and empyema s/p
bronch, decortication, and chest tube who presented to ED with
nausea and vomiting found to have acutely worsening pericardial
effusion, underwent pericardiocentesis, post-procedure course
complicated by pericarditis.

# Pericardial Effusion:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11182**] remained hemodynamically stable in ED prior to
pericardial drain without evidence of tamponade based on TTE,
though pulses was initially 16. Patient is underwent
pericardiocentesis, during which 750cc of serosanguinous fluid
was removed. Pericardial drain was left in place for roughly 48
hours.  Repeat TTE after removal of drain showed no further
accumulation of pericardial fluid.  Etiology of pericardial
effusion presumed to be secondary to spread of strep pneumo in
setting of recent pneumonia.  Gram Stain initially showed GPCs
but lab later clarified that this may have been misread and may
be debris; culture results negative to date, but patient had
been on augmentin for pneumonia prior to pericardial fluid
cultures, so 16S PCR was sent from pericardial fluid and is
still pending.  Mycoplasma IgG and IgM were also sent and
pending.  With question of GPCs in pericardial fluid, he was
started on Vancomycin to cover for potential MRSA; augmentin was
switched to IV ceftriaxone to cover for strep pneumo.  He was
discharged on two more weeks of levofloxacin.

# Pericarditis
Pain was controlled initially with IV toradol and IV nar
