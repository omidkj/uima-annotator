Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8404**]
Chief Complaint:
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
88 y.o. Female w/ h.o. RA on Methotrexate BIBA from home with
fevers, dyspnea.

Per the pt she states she was experiencing cold symptoms for the
past week, she was seen by her nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 112**] at home
and had a CXR. She was told she had a spot in her lungs, it is
unclear if this referred to an infection vs nodule. She denies
any cough, sore throat, chest pain but did not some fevers and
shortness of breath at home for the past 2 days. Her home health
aide called 911 given her difficulty breathing.

Per ED report EMs noted she was 84% on RA so they applied a NRB
to her. Coming to the ED she was able to wean down to 5L nasal
canula.

In the ED here initial VS were noted to be T104.9, BP 161/96, HR
131, RR 44, Sat 96% on 5L. She triggered in the ED on arrival
and was documented to be alert, orientated x 3. Given her fevers
she was given Tylenol 650mg PR. A CXr revealed a retrocardiac
opacity, she was thus started on Levofloxacin and Vancomycin.
Her initial labwork was notable for leukocytosis of 13.4,
neutrophillic (94.5). Na 131, Phos 2.0. PT/INR noted to be
14.9/1.3. AG of 19 with HCO3 21. Lactate 1.7. Given her level of
tachypnea the ED discussed code status with the pt. The pt
expressed to the ED that she was DNR/DNI. She does not want to
be intubated. They attempted BiPAP, however pt did not tolerate
it. They also gave her Toradol 30mg IV for her fevers as she was
still feverish to 101 and uncomfortable. She was given a total
of 2L IVF with her HR responding, decreasing from 140 to 111.

She usually gets her care at [**Hospital1 112**], her Rheumatologist is also
there, she has been taking Mtx for her RA. She denies any
history of PNA, denies any constipation, diarrhea. She does have
LE edema which she says usually occurs when she uses her
wheelchair.

Imaging:
Echo: [**2195-7-9**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated asending aorta and aortic arch. Moderate aortic
stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation. Mild functional mitral
stenosis in the setting of extensive mitral annular
calcification. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

EKG:  [**2195-7-8**]
Sinus tachycardia. Intra-atrial conduction delay. Consider
inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age, although is
non-diagnostic. Early precordial QRS transition is non-specific.
Consider left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave changes. Cannot
exclude myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

CXR: [**2195-7-8**]
The study is limited by portable technique and patient
positioning.
Please note the patient's chin overlies the left apex. There is
marked
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. There is poor evaluation
of the right hilar structures. There is suggestion of streaky
opacity in the retrocardiac left lower lobe. Conceivably, this
could be atelectasis, although an early developing infiltrate
cannot be entirely excluded. No gross consolidation is noted.
The mediastinum is grossly unremarkable again within limitation
of not fully evaluating the right perihilar region. The cardiac
silhouette size is difficult to assess but is presumed enlarged.
There is blunting of the right costophrenic angle indicating a
small effusion. Left effusion is difficult to entirely exclude.
There is no large pneumothorax. The bones are severely and
diffusely osteopenic. There is deformity of the proximal right
humerus which may be due to prior trauma.
IMPRESSION: Numerous limitations as above. There is a left
retrocardiac
opacity which may represent atelectasis, although an early
developing
pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There is a small right
effusion with an elevated right hemidiaphragm. Remaining
findings as above.

CXR:  [**2195-7-9**]
In comparison with the study of [**7-8**], respiratory motion greatly
obscures the image. Continued retrocardiac opacification that
could represent volume loss in the left lower lobe, though
superimposed pneumonia can certainly not be excluded in the
appropriate clinical setting. Bilateral pleural effusions with
evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure

CXR:  [**2195-7-11**]
Comparison is made to previous study from [**2195-7-9**]. Cardiac
silhouette is enlarged but stable. There is again seen a
moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion and a left
retrocardiac opacity.  Left-sided pleural effusion is also seen.
Ununited severe fracture deformity of the left proximal humerus
at the surgical neck is again seen and stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 y/o female with hx of rheumtoid arthritis on methotrexate who
presented with sepsis from a suspected pulmonary source.
Hospital course was complicated by the development of atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, a seizure,
hypotension, NSTEMI and worsening respiratory status. On
admission, the pt's wishes for DNR/DN
