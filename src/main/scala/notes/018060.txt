Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history of ethmoid cancer
resected at [**Hospital6 1129**] in [**2162**].

He had a repeat resection here on [**2167-5-22**] by
Ear/Nose/Throat and Neurosurgery.  Postoperative course was
uneventful.  The patient had no cerebrospinal fluid leak.
He passed a swallow evaluation and was discharged to
rehabilitation on [**2167-5-28**].

He began having mental status changes and seizure activity on
the day of admission.  He became unresponsive.  He had a
fever to 102 and was transferred here for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Rheumatoid arthritis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination his temperature was 97.9, blood pressure was
124/55, heart rate was 72, respiratory rate was 20, and
oxygen saturation was 97%.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were full.  He had
bilateral orbital edema.  His cardiovascular status revealed
a regular rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds and
second heart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Pulmonary examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No
masses.  Extremity examination revealed no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  On neurologic examination, he did not
open his eyes.  He did grasp hand bilaterally.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed some mild
fluid overload; slightly improved.  No infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   He was seen by the Ophthalmology Service
and ruled out for orbital cellulitis.  He had a lumbar
puncture and a magnetic resonance imaging with evidence of an
epidural versus subdural frontal collection.

On [**2167-5-31**] the patient was taken to the operating room
for exploration and drainage of a frontal collection.  A
drain was in place, and the patient was monitored in the
Intensive Care Unit postoperatively where he had severe
facial swelling, and his eyes were swollen shut.

Postoperatively, he was awake and following commands.  He was
moving all extremities to commands.  The fluid collection was
sent for a culture.

He was seen by Infectious Disease Service.  He was placed on
vancomycin 1 g q.12h. and ceftazidime 2 g q.8h. for initial
antibiotic coverage.  The Gram stain showed gram-positive
cocci and gram-negative rods from the abscess.

The patient had a bone flap removed.  Therefore, there was a
skull defect.  The patient will require six weeks of
intravenous antibiotic coverage.  His drain was removed on
postoperative day four (on [**2167-6-3**]), and he was
transferred to the regular floor after being seen by Physical
Therapy and Occupational Therapy.

He was also re-evaluated by the Swallow Service.  He passed
the swallow with some modifications.  He needs to be on a
nectar-thick ground solid diet.  Pills need to be crushed and
pureed.  He needs to maintain aspiration precautions.  He
should be full upright for all meals, alternating between
bites and sips, and two to three swallows for each bite and
sip.

His dressing was removed, and his incision was clean, dry,
and intact.  He had a peripherally inserted central catheter
line placed on [**2167-6-5**].  He currently continues on
gentamicin 100 mg intravenously q.12h. and ceftazidime 2 g
intravenously q.8h.  He was growing Proteus from the culture
from his surgery.

The patient was to be discharged on ceftazidime 2 g
intravenously q.8h. and ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.12h.;
together for a total of six weeks.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1906**] at [**Hospital 14852**] in four to six weeks.
2.  The patient should also have his staples removed at
rehabilitation in 14 days postoperatively.
3.  The patient should also be fitted for a helmet due to the
bone defect once at rehabilitation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Medications at the time of
discharge included)
1.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.24h.
2.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. twice per day.
3.  Sodium chloride nasal spray four times per day as needed.
4.  Ceftazidime 2 g intravenously q.8h.
5.  Folic acid 1 mg p.o. once per day
6.  Gentamicin 100 mg intravenously q.12h. (peak and trough
