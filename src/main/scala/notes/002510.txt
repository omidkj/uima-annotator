68 yo male with Parkinson's disease and no known CAD presented
to outside hospital with acute chest pain. Pt states that around
2am, he developed substernal chest pain with associated SOB and
diaphoresis while picking up granddaughter. [**Name (NI) **] nausea, vomiting,
radiation. Pain persisted and her called 911. Arrived at OSH at
3am, where he was hemodynamically stable with EKG that showed
2-4mm ST elevations in V2-5 and 1/avl with reciprocal inferior
depressions. No cardiac enzymes. He was given asa, IV lopressor,
and heparin. Started on nitro gtt, given MSO4. Transferred here
to cath lab. Cath demonstrated proximal occlusion of LAD,
intervened with 2 cypher stents with no residual stenoses. R
heart cathw ith mildly elevated filling pressures. (RA 19, RV
45/17, PA 45/26, wedge 25 and cardiac indez 2.16. Received IV
heparin, integrillin, 10 I lasix, nitro gtt, and plavix 300.

.
EKG: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm @79. QS configuration in
leads VI-V2 - probable
anteroseptal myocardial infarction with ST-T wave configuration
suggesting
acute/recent/in evolution process. Clinical correlation is
suggested. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
CXR: no chf, infiltrate
.
Cath:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe one vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderately elevated right sided filling pressures.
3. Moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
4. Successful PCI of the LAD.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the distal half of the septum, mid
anterior wall
and apex. The distal anterior and lateral walls are hypokinetic.
No left
ventricular aneurysm is seen. . No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left
ventricle. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD (mid LAD
lesion). Mild mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Pt is s/p acute anterior STEMI with peak CK of 1349. Pt
was started on ASA, Lipitor 80, Plavix. Integrillin was not used
during cardiac cath [**2-26**] recent cataract surgery. However, after
ophtho stated that anticoagulation was okay, pt was started on
heparin. Pt was started on beta-blocker and ACE which were
tirated up.
.
2. Pump: Pt was found to EF of 35% without aneurysm or thrombus.
Initially pt was slightly volume overloaded with elevated
filling pressures in cath lab. Fluid goal was even to slightly
negative. Pt was continued on heparin for depressed EF. Coumadin
was started with heparin bridge. INR on discharge is 1.5.
.
3. Rhythm: Stable without any issues.
.
4. s/p cataract surgery: Stable without issues. Pt was told to
follow-up with outpatient ophthamologist.
.
5. Parkinson's disease: Stable. Pt's only home meds is coenzyme
Q. Pt recently discontinued Vitamin E. Pt was told to follow up
with outpatient neurologist for further evaluation of
Parkinson's disease.
