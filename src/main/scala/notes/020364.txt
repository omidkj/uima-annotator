Admission Date:  [**2173-12-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2173-12-7**]


Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncope.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
female transferred from [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital with
presentation of syncope of initially unclear etiology.  The
patient reports and family corroborates that the patient has
had increased episodes of syncope over the past several
weeks, most recently with presentation to [**Location (un) **] Emergency
Department post syncopal episode at [**Company **] two
weeks prior to admission.  At that time the patient reports
that she was feeling unwell and sat down at the [**Doctor Last Name **]
Supermarket, once again got up and went to the cash register
and at that point had a complete syncopal episode.  She was
taken to the [**Location (un) **] Emergency Department where she signed
herself out against medical advice before formal work-up was
done.

On her current presentation the patient was in her bathroom
at home, had an unwitnessed episode of syncope, awoke feeling
no confusion, weakness, chest pain, shortness of breath and
made it back to her bedroom on her hands and knees and called
her son who called the EMS.  At [**Hospital **] Hospital the patient
was initially worked up with a head CT which was negative for
a bleed, and chest x-ray which showed likely right lower lobe
infiltrate with small effusion.  She was transferred to the
inpatient floor and found to be in atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response in the 100s to 180s.  She was
hypotensive to the 80s.

She was started on intravenous Lopresor with one dose, became
more hypotensive, was attempted to be DC cardioverted x 2
doses of 20 joules and then 30 joules with no change.  She
was then given a diltiazem bolus and drip after the pressures
came back to a systolic pressure of about 100.  The diltiazem
was discontinued and the patient was sent to the Emergency
Department where she was heparinized and given
Neo-Synephrine, and then was transferred over to [**Hospital1 346**] for further work-up and evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Her past history is significant for
past syncopal episodes in the last 25 years, episodes
occurring only once every several years, unclear work-up.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.  3. Recently treated for ? pneumonia
by her primary care physician around the time of [**Holiday 1451**]
with Keflex.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Pravachol and aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies..

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol.
She is a homemaker, lives at home with her husband, who is
actually currently at a nursing home recovering from a
congestive heart failure exacerbation.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Fever two days prior to admission and
weight loss of about 20 pounds over the last several months.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission her temperature was 97.3,
blood pressure 89/41, pulse 78, O2 saturation 97% on room
air.  In general she was an elderly female in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
showed pupils equal, round and reactive to light and
accommodation; extraocular movements intact.  The neck was
supple with dry mucous membranes, jugular venous pressure to
8 cm.  Cardiovascular examination showed a regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, [**1-13**] crescendo murmur at the left
upper sternal border.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally with diminished breath sounds at the right base
with positive egophony.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended with normal active bowel sounds, with slight
right upper quadrant tenderness.  Extremities were warm with
no edema.  The skin was intact with no rashes.
Musculoskeletal examination showed the back to have midline
mild tenderness.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 18.9, hematocrit
34.5, platelet count 189.  Sodium 139, potassium 3.7,
chloride 105, bicarbonate 19, BUN 37, creatinine 1.2, glucose
115, calcium 7.5, magnesium 1.9, phosphorous 3.9, amylase 57.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is an 85-year-old female with a
history of syncopal episodes in the past who presents with a
new syncopal episode, transferred from an outside hospital
with likely community-acquired pneumonia with new onset
atrial fibrillation, hypotension and right upper quadrant
tenderness with normal liver function tests.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Cardiovascular:  Coronaries - patient
was ruled out for myocardial infarction given an
ischemic-appearing EKG and actually did wind up having a
troponin elevation to about 10.7, likely was demand ischemia
in the setting of the atrial fibrillation.  The troponins
peaked at 10.7 and then did trend down over the next two
days.  The patient was started on a beta blocker, was
continued on the aspirin.

Pump - right-sided heart failure on examination; no
peripheral edema.  The patient was given a small amount of
fluid initially to keep her blood pressure up, however this
was not continued and there was no need for diuresis.
Echocardiogram was performed on [**2173-12-6**] which showed a
normal ejection fraction and only slightly enlarged left
atrium.  There was no significant note made of aortic
stenosis.

Rhythm - the patient was initially in atrial fibrillation at
the outside hospital.  While here there were no episodes of
atrial fibrillation, only some episodes of premature atrial
beats as well as small runs of atrial tachycardia of about 10
beats each.  The patient was not started on any
antiarrhythmics and the likely cause of her atrial
fibrillation was the pneumonia which is now under treatment.
She will not be started on long-term anticoagulation aside
from the aspirin and will benefit from an outpatient stress
test which will be set up by her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3403**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5456**], as the stress as an inpatient would likely be
inconclusive given the fact that she has a pneumonia right
now which could complicate things.

2. Pulmonary:  The patient had evidence of right lower lobe
pneumonia was found on examination as well as chest x-ray.
She was started on levofloxacin and had no further episodes
of fever.  Oxygen saturations remained above 94% consistently
on room air and the patient felt significantly better over
the next several days and will be continued for a full 10-day
course of levofloxacin.

3. Gastrointestinal:  The patient had right upper quadrant
tenderness initially on presentation, unclear in etiology.
She was evaluated with an abdominal CT on [**2173-12-4**], which did
not show any significant pathology.  The right upper quadrant
tenderness did actually resolve on its own and it is unclear
at this time what initially caused it.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Syncope.
2. Atrial fibrillation.
3. Community-acquired pneumonia.
4. Hypertension.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.  The patient was evaluated by
physical therapy who recommended some home physical therapy
which was set up through the VNA and her back pain is now
significantly improved.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Pravachol.
2. Aspirin.
3. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for six days post discharge.
