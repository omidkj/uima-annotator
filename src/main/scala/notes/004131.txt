History of Present Illness:
This is a 43 yo female with a PMH of Hep C, migraine headaches,
h/o drug overdose, h/o seizures, asthma, who presents s/p
polypharmacy overdose this morning.  Apparently the pt told her
[**Last Name (un) 8317**] that she had overdosed on ativan, seroquel,
wellbutrin, marijuana, and ETOH at 8:30 AM. The pts [**Last Name (un) 8317**]
called EMS who found the pt lethargic and minimally arousable.
.
In the ED, the pts vitals were: T 97.8 HR 107 BP 123/61, RR 14,
sat 99% RA.  She told ED nurses she took 8 tabs of ativan, 5
tabs of seroquel, 2 bottles of wine, and had +SI.  The pt was
lethargic in the ED and tox screen was found to be positive for
cocaine.  ETOH level was 167. Decision was made to protect the
pts airway, so she was given Etomidate 20 mg IV and Succ 120 mg
IV prior to intubation.  The pt was noted to aspirate during
intubation and vomited 3 times.  She was started on propfol gtt
and received Vecuronium 10 mg IVx 1 and then 5 mg IV x1.  She
received 3 L IVF.    NGT was placed and pt was given charcoal
down the NG tube.  ABG on AC 550x14, PEEP 5, 40% FiO2 was
7.28/48/323.  The pt was seen by toxicology who recommended
seizure precautions, fluids for hypotension, serial EKGs to
follow QTc level, and trileptal levels.
.
At this time, the pt is sedated and unable to answer questions.

.
EKG: sinus tach at 110, nl axis, QTc 427 ms
.
Initial CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Tip of the nasogastric tube within the superior portion of
the esophagus. Re-evaluation recommended. 2.  Collapse of right
upper lobe with mediastinal shift and elevation of right
hemidiaphragm.  These findings could suggest either acute mucous
plugging or in this clinical setting, significant aspiration.  A
repeat chest x-ray should be performed following suction of
tracheal contents and repositioning of nasogastric tube.
.
Repeat CXR:
Portable supine frontal radiograph compared to study done two
hours earlier demonstrates partial re-expansion of the right
upper lobe.  There has been interval development of increased
perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing suggestive of
increasing interstitial edema.  An NG tube has been advanced
with its tip now in the proximal stomach, but the proximal side
port remains above the GE junction. IMPRESSION:  Worsening
pulmonary edema.  NG tube which is too high and should be
advanced.  Partial re-expansion of the right upper lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
+A/P: 43 yo female with a PMH of Hep C, migraine headaches, h/o
drug overdose, h/o seizures, asthma, who presents s/p
polypharmacy overdose and now intubated for airway protection.
.
#Polypharmacy overdose: Pt overdosed on seroquel which, per
toxicology note, can cause hypotension, tachycardia, elevated
LFTs, seizures, QTc prolongation, hyperglycemia, and elevated CK
levels.  Wellbutrin overdose can lead to dose-related seizures,
especially in those with prior h/o seizure, and cause
hypertension/tachycardia.  Cocaine would lead to hypertension
and tachycardia.  The pt reportedly overdosed on ativan, but
urine and blood tox screen was negative for benzos.  EKG showed
normal QTc interval.  She has no evidence of tylenol or ASA
overdose.  Patient was monitored in the ICU and did not have any
signs of intoxicaiton.  She was seen by psych who recommended
inpatient psych once she was medically cleared. She was
transferred to the general medicine floor [**2103-11-10**] and monitored
overnight, repeat ECG showed stable QTc and she was deemed
stable medically for inpatient psychiatric treatment.
.
#Airway Protection: Pt on CMV overnight for airway protection.
She was extubated [**2103-11-9**] without any complications.  She has a
history of smoking and ashthma and was given scheduled nebs for
post extubation wheezing.
.
#ETOH abuse:  Given thiamine folate, B12 supplments and started
on CIWA scale post extubation, although did not require in the
MICU or on the general medicine floor through 72 hours after
admission.
.
#Fever: Pt spiked temp of 101.9 on arrival to the MICU.  DDX
included aspiration pneumonitis vs. overdose on
seroquel/wellbutrin.  She was given clindamycin for aspiration
PNA, however she defervasced quickly and did not have any
obvious remaining infitrate thus abx were stopped (after 12
hours). No further fevers noted.
.
#H/o Seizure: Pt is on trileptal and topamax at home (trileptal
for h/o seizure and topamax for migraines).  Psych recommended
d/c trileptal and topamx and will reassess her medications on
the inpatient psych floor.
.
#Depression: Has had problems with suicide attempts in the past,
seen by psych and will need inpatient psych.  Maintained on
suicide precautions with 1:1 sitter on the medical floor.
