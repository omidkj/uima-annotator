History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] is a 69 yo M w/ h/o HTN and significant tobacco
use, who had a severe headache on [**2131-4-19**] without associated
symptoms (including weakness, visual changes), and was found to
be hypertensive to 220/110.  He was transferred via ambulence to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and in route complained of right sided chest
discomfort, associated with dyspnea and diaphoreiss. By report
he was administered SL NTG and nitro paste with improvement in
BP and chest discomfort.  He subsequently underwen ETT with
pMIBI which demonstrated a perfusion deficit at rest and was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and renal artery
angiogram.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] also reports decreased exercise tolerance over the
past several months - previously he would be able to climb
several flights of stairs without difficulty; he currently gets
extremely dypsneic after 10 steps (<1 flight); no associated CP,
N, or diahphoresis.  He denies orthopnea and PND.
.
He denies history of angina or CAD.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] cardiac catheterization today and was
found to have 3VD, and a CABG is now planned.  He took a dose of
plavix this morning.
.
ROS: denies recent illness, fevers, hematuria, melena, bloody
stools, abdominal pain, LE swelling.  Reports 8lb intentional
weight loss (healthier diet)
Referred for CABG .

Recent testing:
[**2131-4-24**]: Echo showed a normal LV size and function.  EF of
60-65%.  The valves were all normal with trace TR.  Pulmonary
systolic pressure was estimated to be 30-35%. [**2131-4-20**]: Nuclear
stress test where the patient exercised for 6 minutes 57 seconds
on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol stopping due to shortness of breath and leg
pain.  He achieved 68% of his predicted target heart rate.  He
did not develop any arrhythmias or chest pain.  The nuclear
images demonstrated a normal sized left ventricle. There was a
moderate sized reversible perfusion abnormality involving the
anteroapical and septal portion left ventricle. There was also a
question of a small reversible abnormality involving the
inferolateral portion left ventricle.  The left ventricular wall
motion was normal.  The LVEF was 62%.
.
[**2131-4-30**] Cardiac Catheterization
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main
coronary artery had no angiographically apparent flow limiting
stenoses.  The LAD was ectatic proximally and occluded in the
mid segment after a small diagonal.  The LCX had a 90% stenosis
of the OM1 proximally and a 50% followed by a 70% stenosis in
the proximal and mid segment of the OM2. The RCA had a 90%
stenosis in the mid PDA.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly to moderately
elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP was 18 mm Hg).
Systemic arterial pressure was normal (aortic pressure was
121/73 mm Hg).  There was no significant gradient across the
aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left
ventricle to the ascending aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a contrast calculated
ejection
fraction of 65%.  No mitral regurgitation was noted. 4.
Bilateral selective renal angiography demonstrated widely patent
renal arteries.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
3. Mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
4. No angiographically apparent renal artery stenosis.
