Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension:  *6.0 cm  <= 4.0 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  40% to 45%  >= 55%
Aorta - Ascending:  2.6 cm  <= 3.4 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. No mass/thrombus in the
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. No thrombus
in the RAA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) LV
diastolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber
size. Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
leaflets move normally. No masses or vegetations on aortic
valve. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.

Conclusions
Pt for Sternal Debridement.
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage.
2. No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis. Doppler parameters are
most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction.
4. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global
free wall hypokinesis.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
