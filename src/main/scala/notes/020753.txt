Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 105589**] is a 73yo M with a PMH of COPD, HTN, obesity,
depression, who presents to the ER from his NH for altered
mental status and hypotension. Mr. [**Known lastname 105589**] was seen in urology
today and had his foley catheter replaced. On return to his NH,
he was noted to look feverish and have altered mental status.
His skin was noted to be warm and his BP was low at 78/palp. On
arrival to the ED, his BP was 78/42 and his O2 sats were 86% on
2L nc and 100% on NRB. Initial temp on arrival was 101.4 and he
was tachycardic to 110. He was diaphoretic and was rigoring. He
had 2 peripheral IVs placed, received 2L NS by bolus, and was
given PR tylenol for his fever. Cx (blood and urine) were drawn,
CXR was performed, and he was then given CTX, vanco and flagyl.
He was noted to have frank pus expressed from his foley catheter
prior to obtaining UA and cx. Despite the IVF, his BP dropped to
74/49 and attempts at a central line were made. A subclavian
line was unable to be obtained despite multiple sticks. He was
given levophed through a peripheral IV until a femoral line
could be placed (his BP at that point had dropped to 63/45).
Once the R femoral line was in place, levophed was started in
the femoral line with good response in his BP. Levophed was
titrated up to keep MAP >60. He went for a CT a/p with contrast
which did not show a source of infection (showed fecal
impaction, cholelithiasis w/o cholecystitis, and degenerative
disease of his hip). He was disimpacted and had a BM, which was
noted to be brown but guaiac positive. He had a bedside cardiac
U/S performed which did not show any appreciable pericardial
effusion. In total, he was given 5L IVF in the ER, with 770 cc
of UOP. BP remained borderline on the levophed. He was
transferred up to the MICU for further management.
.
Of note, pt has never been here before and we have no data on
him. He is a poor historian and is unable to give reliable
information about his PMH.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: fever and hypoxia

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
fever and hypoxia
INDICATION: Fever and hypoxia.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: Portable chest upright radiograph reviewed. There is
an ill- defined opacity in the right upper lobe. There is
discoid atelectasis at the left base. The heart and mediastinal
contours are remarkable for a tortuous aorta. No pleural
effusions are identified. Degenerative changes and possibly
prior left humeral fracture are noted within a high-riding left
humerus

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS

Reason: pls r/o PE
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old man with tachycardia, hypotension, and RV dilation
on echo
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pls r/o PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Tachycardia, hypotension, right ventricular dilation
on echocardiograph.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images
through the chest before and after administration of IV
contrast. Multiplanar reformats were also obtained.

CT CHEST ANGIO: There are aortic vascular calcifications;
however, the aorta is not dilated. There is no evidence of
dissection. Coronary vascular calcifications are seen. No
evidence of pulmonary embolism is identified. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: There is a small right
thyroid lobe nodule. Dependent low density material in the
trachea probably represents retained secretions. There is a 5mm
lung nodule in left upper lobe. There is atelectasis in the
right lower lung in the posterior aspect. Atelectasis is also
seen in the posterior aspect of the left lower lung. No pleural
effusions are seen. Limited views of the abdomen are notable for
markedly arthrosclerotic splenic artery. There is a small hiatal
hernia. The gallbladder is markedly enlarged, and filled with
high- density material, consistent in appearance with the large
sludge-filled gallbladder seen on ultrasound of the same day.

Bone windows show diffuse demineralization; however, there are
no lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is an S-shaped scoliosis.
There are marked degenerative changes of the spine, with loss of
disc height at all levels. There is right glenohumeral joint DJD
and healing fractures of several ribs.

Multiplanar reformats were essential in delineating the findings
above.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

2. Large dilated gallbladder filled with high-density material
consistent in appearance with the ultrasound examination of th
