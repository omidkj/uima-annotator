History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year-old female with a PMH of HTN, PVD,
seizure disorder, chronic pain on oxycodone, methadone, OSA who
presented to an OSH on [**2150-3-6**] after being found stuporous with
white foam and white poweder around her mouth at home. Her son,
whom she lives with, reviewed her [**Date Range 4085**] boxes and verified
that no medications were missing or overconsumed. EMS brought
her to the ED and en route she was given Narcan with some
effect. On presentation, she was found to be hypoxic to 74% on
RA with rhonchi and had a Glascow of 4. She was noted to have a
depressed mental status with an absent gag and some secretions
at the glottic opening. She was intubated for airway protection
(7.34/60/322). A CXR was performed and was negative for
pneumonia per report. Her labs were significant for a lipase of
3882 and WBC of 15 and serum and urine tox were significant for
positive TCA, methadone, and THC, but negative for tylenol,
phenobarbital, and alcohol. Creatinine and LFTs were normal with
a mildly elevated Alk phos. An EKG was also NSR. The
differential was thought to include seizure versus aspiration vs
overdose. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgmnt and her
ventilator settings at the time were Vt 500, 90% PEEP 5 RR 18.
There was difficulty noted in weaning the FiO2. She was
intermittently sedated with ativan.
.
On arrival, her VS were T 102.6 P 110 100%ra BP 170/100. She was
intubated but awake and alert, following simple commands. A RSBI
was performed and was 150, with a RR of 25 and Vt of ~200. She
was also witnessed to aspirate.
.
Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable per report.

Physical Exam:
T 102.6 P 110 100%ra BP 170/100
PHYSICAL EXAM
GENERAL: intubated, agitated, awake, alert, responds to commands

HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, ETT. No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus. PERRLA/EOMI. MMM. OP clear. Neck Supple, No
LAD, No thyromegaly.
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm, normal rate. Normal S1, S2. [**2-20**]
ejection murmur at RUSB. No JVD.

Pertinent Results:
[**3-9**] echo: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no left ventricular
outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is higher than
expected for this type of prosthesis. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due
to suboptimal image quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global systolic function.
Bioprosthetic AVR with higher than expected gradients.
Endocarditis cannot be excluded on the basis of this study.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-3-8**],
inferior hypokinesis is not seen on the current study. The apex
is well seen and contracts normally.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
.
CXR [**3-9**]: Left moderately severe left lower lobe atelectasis has
progressed, mild interstitial edema is new accompanied by
increasing small bilateral pleural effusions and increase in top
normal heart size as well as congestion of the hilar and
mediastinal vessels. ET tube, right internal jugular line,
nasogastric tube in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
.
MRI head [**3-9**]:
1. No acute infarction.
2. Contour irregularity of the left middle cerebral artery, and
some of the branches of the right middle cerebral artery with
minimal decrease in caliber of the left middle cerebral artery
in the interval since the prior study, with mild narrowing.
Vasculitis related changes or other etiology cannot be excluded.
Interventional neuorradiology consult can be consdiered for
further management decision.
3. No flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion or aneurysm more than
3 mm within the resolution of MR angiogram.
.
CXR [**3-10**]: Lateral aspect of the right chest is excluded from the
examination. Mild pulmonary edema and small right pleural
effusion increased. Heart size top normal. Mediastinal venous
engorgement unchanged. Left lower lobe largely airless probably
due to atelectasis. ET tube, nasogastric tube and right internal
jugular line in standard placements. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**3-12**]
1. Improved CHF.
2. Multifocal patchy and linear opacities in mid and lower
lungs, many of
which may be due to atelectasis, but coexisting pneumonia should
be considered considering clinical suspicion for infection.
3. Right middle lobe atelectasis, for which followup radiographs
are
suggested to document resolution.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
EEG [**3-9**] This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the
background activity which was at times slow and disorganized and
at
other times showed a burst suppression pattern. These
abnormalities are
suggestive of encephalopathy. The first one of moderate
encephalopathy
and the second one with a more severe encephalopathy. The fact
that the
patient's background was viable throughout the recording is
suggestive
of the possibility of a better prognosis of encephalopathy.
Metabolic
disturbances, medications, infection, and ischemia are among the
most
common causes of encephalopathy. There are no clear epileptiform

features seen in this recording. Of note is the tachycardia.
