Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
fever & hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis via R IJ tunneled catheter

History of Present Illness:
67 yo man w/ h/o ESRD [**1-23**] IgA nephropathy on HD, HTN, COPD, ETOH
hepatitis who presented from HD [**2116-12-5**] with fever to 101. On
arrival was febrile to 102.3. No localizing sources known. Has
had R IJ tunnelled cath x 2 months, and had fisutlogram done the
day before admission. On admission, his SBP was noted to be
slightly down from baseline at 70-90's in ED (normal 110s). BP
on admission to ED was 77/33. Lactate was also elevated on
admission (5.3 on HD w/ ESRD, so utility questionable, repeat
[**12-6**] 1.5). He noted a fever on the day before admission at
home. Also c/o chills/rigors after returning home from his
fistulogram. Also c/o productive cough (white sputum); however,
this is chronic. He denies CP, Palps, SOB, abd pain, N/V,
dysuria, or diarrhea. He continues to make urine daily.
.
While at HD, the patient received a dose of Vanco and Gent. It
is unclear if blood cxs were drawn prior to this. In the ED, he
received 1L NS. CXR and RUQ U/S were both unrevealing. Blood
cultures were drawn peripherally (not from HD line). He was
given a dose of Ceftriaxone in ED as well. He was then
transferred to MICU for closer monitoring.
.
MICU Course: patient continued on Vancomycin (s/p 1000mg [**12-5**]).
Has not received further doses of gent. Given IVF and
antihypertensives held. T max 101 overnight [**12-5**] --> [**12-6**]

appreciated.

FISTULOGRAM ([**2116-12-4**]):
1. Initial AV fistulogram demonstrates an area of kinking within
the cephalic vein, with two prominent venous collaterals
proximal to this area.
2. Angioplasty of this area of kinking was performed, which
demonstrated mild improvement.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo man w/ h/o ESRD [**1-23**] IgA nephropathy on HD, HTN, COPD, ETOH
hepatitis initally admitted to MICU after being sent from HD
with fever and hypotension clinically improved but with MSSA [**12-27**]
blood cultures, staph aureus 2/2 blood cultures from HD
([**Hospital1 392**]).
.
1-FEVER: Improved, likely line sepsis given + blood cultures:
MSSA [**12-27**] blood cultures, staph aureus 2/2 blood cultures from HD
([**Hospital1 392**]). No other localizing sxs. Also had elevated lactate and
WBC (improved). RUQ U/S and CXR unremarkable. Fistulogram
unrevealing for clot or abscess. Peripheral cultures drawn,
however received Vanco/Gent at HD prior to dose, cultures from
HD NGTD. Other potential source could be pulmonary, but
unlikely. Has chronic cough related to COPD, unchanged. He had
his tunneled catheter removed [**12-8**] at the bedside, attempted HD
via fistula [**12-9**] which did not work, so required replacement of
tunnerled HD catheter on [**12-10**], followed by HD, and was stable
for discharge. He was started on levofloxacin on [**12-7**] out of
concern for bronchitis with COPD but given + blood cultures,
lack of respiratory symptoms, this was stopped [**12-10**].
.
2-Contact Dermatitis: [**Name2 (NI) **] at line removal site corresponding to
tegaderm, ? cotnact dermatitis, tegaderm removed, will try sarna
cream and use gauze/tape. Other sites of tegaderm (IV) not
errythematous/indurated/pruruitic, improved slightly with sarna
lotion, recommend to continue this.
.
3-HYPOTENSION: Pt initially w/episode of hypotension in ED. may
have been related to HD w/ fluid removal; however, also had
fever, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate c/w SIRS/sepsis (line
as potential source). BP stablized after first hospital day, no
tachycardia, but BP remained 120's systolic so he was not
resarted on metoprolol, this should be restarted when BP
increases.
.
4-ESRD on HD: renal followed in the hospital. Continue HD
sessions per outpatient regimen, had attempt via fistula which
was not successful so he had a tunneled line placed. Will resume
T/T/S schedule, to follow-up with transplant for fistula,
continued on nephrocaps.
.
5-COPD: Pt seems to be at baseline, has h/o chronic cough,
satting well, on levofloxacin as above for possible bronchitis
though that was stopped as sputum unchanged.
.
6-THROMBOCYTOPENIA: stable to improving, likely [**1-23**] to
cirrhosis, although trending down since [**9-25**]. ?consumption [**1-23**]
to sepsis. No signs of bleeding, followed platelet count in
house and it trended up to 165 by discharge.
.
7-ELEVATED [**Doctor First Name 674**]/LIP: mild elevation, trending down, not
associated signs or symptoms of pancreatitis but chronic etoh.
?[**1-23**] to EtOH.
.
8-Hyperglycemia: blood glucose to 200 intermittantly, covered
with SSHI/monitor blood glucose qid, no known diabetes, ? stress
reaction [**1-23**] infection, will need to be followed as an
outpatient.
.
9-ETOH abuse: monitored on CIWA while here with no signs or
symptoms of withdrawl, no medication needed.
.
10-PPX: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, no GI currently indicated
.
