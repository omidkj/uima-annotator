Operative Note
-------------------
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute cholecystitis.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute and chronic cholecystitis
with cystic duct obstruction secondary to stone.

OPERATION:
1.  Diagnostic laparoscopy.
2.  Open cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram.

ASSISTANTS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 15738**] [**Name (STitle) 24629**].

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 24630**] is a 69-year-old
lady with a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and gallstone pancreatitis status post
sphincterotomy in [**2191**] who presented with a 3-day history of
right upper quadrant pain.  She had a fever and leukocytosis and
normal liver function tests. Given the duration of her symptoms
we attempted conservative treatment with bowel rest and
intravenous antibiotics. After 24 hours, she continued to have
fevers and right upper quadrant tenderness and leukocytosis.
Accordingly, I advised a cholecystectomy. I explained that given
the duration of the symptoms there would be a high likelihood of
conversion to an open cholecystectomy but that we would attempt
a
laparoscopic approach. The risks and benefits of the procedure
were discussed with the patient and she consented to proceed.

INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:
1.  Upon diagnostic laparoscopy there was serous fluid in the
    right upper quadrant. The omentum was firmly adherent to
    the liver edge and gallbladder. Limited inspection of the
    fundus of the gallbladder showed it to be ischemic with
    a portion of the wall necrotic. Accordingly, we elected
    to convert fairly quickly to open cholecystectomy.
2.  An attempted cholangiogram was unsuccessful. We were
    unable to successfully pass a cholangiocatheter beyond
    the cystic duct/common duct junction. Upon opening this
    further, it was clear that there was a stone impacted
    here which we could not safely retrieve. We did not wish
    to further dissect the common bile duct given the
    tremendous edema of the tissues.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was identified
in the preoperative holding area and taken to the operating room
where she was positioned supine on the operating room table.
After the adequate induction of general endotracheal anesthesia,
her abdomen was widely sterilely prepped and draped in the usual
fashion. Intravenous Unasyn was administered. A timeout was
performed identifying the patient and the procedure to be
performed.

The infraumbilical space was anesthetized with 0.5% Marcaine
plain. A vertical midline incision was made here and the
fascia was opened in the midline and the peritoneal cavity
entered bluntly without incident. #0 Vicryl sutures were
placed in the fascia and the [**Last Name (un) 24631**] trocar secured. A carbon
dioxide pneumoperitoneum was achieved. An angled 30 degree
laparoscope was inserted. Limited inspection of the lower
abdomen and left upper quadrant was unremarkable. Inspection
of the right upper quadrant showed a large amount of serous
fluid about the liver and an omentum firmly adherent to the
gallbladder and liver edge. Additional local anesthetic was
infiltrated in the epigastrium and a 12-mm transverse incision
was made and a 12-mm port placed. A smooth grasper was placed
via
this port. It was clear that the omentum was firmly tethered to
an ischemic, if not necrotic, gallbladder. An additional 5-mm
port was placed in the right subcostal space in the
mid-clavicular line to facilitate better retraction of the
omentum and inspection of the gallbladder. The omentum was
bluntly taken off the fundus and body of the gallbladder, and
there was a portion of the gallbladder wall which appeared
necrotic. It was clear that we could not safely complete this
operation laparoscopically and so the ports were removed and
the pneumoperitoneum evacuated. We elected to convert at this
time to an open procedure.

A right subcostal incision was made, joining our two previous
port incisions. This was carried down through the subcutaneous
tissues and fascia with the cautery. The rectus muscle was
divided with the cautery. Peritoneal cavity was entered without
incident. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24412**] retractor system was placed. A malleable
retractor was placed on a lap pad and retracted the duodenum and
colon caudally.  We then placed a right angle retractor on the
subcostal margin cranially. There was some bleeding from the
liver edge near the fundus of the gallbladder which was
successfully cauterized. We scored the wall of the gallbladder
approximately 3 mm away from the liver bed. We mobilized the
gallbladder from the fossa by staying in this plane, leaving a
fairly significant rind of tissue on the liver surface. We
carried this dissection all the way down toward the neck of the
gallbladder. We placed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1356**] clamp on the fundus of the
gallbladder as well as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1356**] clamp on the neck of the
gallbladder to aid in retraction. The cystic artery was
identified and cauterized.

At this point we identified what we believed to be the cystic
duct with the cystic duct lymph node; however, there was an
extensive amount of inflammation and edema of the tissues. We
dissected some of this edematous tissue from the anterior
aspect in the porta and exposed what we believed to be the
common bile duct. However, we did not persist a great deal in
this dissection given an increased po
