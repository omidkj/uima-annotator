Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13256**]
Chief Complaint:
Fulminant liver failure - ? Tylenol toxicity, acute renal
failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intracranial bolt placement and removal
Placement of multipl central lines and removal
Placement of tunneled dialysis line
Debridement of feet wound
Intubation and extubation


History of Present Illness:
45F w/ h/o psychiatric disorder, depression and domestic abuse
transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital where she was admitted yesterday
evening with acute liver failure likely secondary to Tylenol
ingestion (level was initially 11 but repeat was <10, o/w tox
was negative for alcohol and urine tox was negative). Per the
outside records, her case worker ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**]) through the
domestic violence shelters was concerned after speaking to her
one day PTA where she was noted to be confused and then went to
see patient and confirmed MS change and went to ED.  There, she
was afebrile, hypotensive (70/45), tachycardic (HR 111), with RR
16 on 2L NC (96% O2 sats). She was given normal saline (6L),
zofran, reglan, protonix, and was started on a norepinephrine
drip. She was also started on an octreotide drip (per GI
consult), vit K and NAC. She had progressive respiratory
distress and was intubated in the MICU.  Prior to intubation she
only answered minimal questions, c/o of abdominal pain and
denied ingestion of any toxic substances or Tylenol.  In MICU,
she had ARF w/ creatinine of 4.1 and anuric, INR 4.9, lactic
acidosis (lactate 5.2 to 6.3), pH 7.23, bicarb 13. Her LFTs
were: AST 6067, ALT 4509; AP 268, TBili 2.1; CK 3087 - peak
9048; WBC 6.6,
HCT 28.6, and Plts 285.  In addition, she was placed on broad
spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin & zosyn) for empiric coverage.
She was transferred here for further management.

Past Medical History:
ankylosing spondylitis (on pain medications, prednisone)
psychiatric disorder (on depakote)
ovarian cyst
Iron deficiency anemia
Victim of domestic abuse


Social History:
History of domestic violence, staying at domestic violence
shelter since 6/[**2159**]. Per reports, no history of drug use,
minimal alcohol use, unknown tobacco smoking status.  However,
interview with family members (who are more or less estranged
from patient) after arrival to SICU, revealed that she has
history of polysubstance abuse including use of crack cocaine.

Pertinent Results:

.
Imaging/diagnostics:
- CT head w/o contrast ([**2159-10-17**]):Diffuse effacement of cerebral
sulci increased from one day prior, suggesting increased diffuse
cerebral edema. Opacification of bilateral ethmoid air cells and
also right mastoid air
cells, probably related to OG tube and ET tube, which are in
place. Narrowed cervical spinal canal at C1, as described above,
and seen to
[**Hospital1 2824**] extent on outside institution CT C-spine from one day
prior.
.
- CT head w/o contrast ([**2159-10-22**]): Improvement in cerebral edema
with reexpansion of the sulci, ventricles and some basal
cisterns. New 1 cm lesion with peripheral hyperdensity in the
superficial left occipital lobe, which could indicate a subacute
hematoma. An infectious or embolic lesion cannot be excluded.
Upon clinical correlation, MRI should be
considered for further evaluation. New partial opacification of
the left mastoid air cells.
.
- EEG ([**2159-10-22**]):This is an abnormal continuous EEG due the
presence of a
6-6.5 Hz theta rhythm background with frequent bursts of frontal
delta
slowing occasionally reaching a semi-rhythmic pattern observed
throughout the recording. This is consistent with a mild to
moderate
diffuse encephalopathy, such as most commonly seen with
medication
effect, metabolic derangement, or infection. Compared to the
previous
tracing, the background rhythm has improved and the patient now
demonstrates evidence of Stage I and II sleep architecture, as
well as a
slow posterior dominant rhythm.
.
- Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound ([**2159-11-1**]): No DVT in
bilateral lower extremity.
.
- CXR ([**2159-11-5**]): Significantly improved multifocal pneumonia.
.
- Echocardiogram ([**2159-11-7**]): The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with normal left
ventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal
biventricular systolic function. Normal left ventricular
diastolic function.



Brief Hospital Course:
45yo F with history of depression, anemia, ankylosing
spondylitis, polysubstance abuse, admitted for acetominophen
overdose resulting in hepatic failure, renal failure,
respiratory failure, cerebral edema, who received vasopressors
through veins in feet resulting in ischemic necrosis.
.
Brief SICU course:
On arrival, R IJ HD line, L IJ CVL (triple lumen), R Axillary
[**Last Name (un) **] a-line were placed, outside hospital femoral a-line along
w/ bilateral pedal PIVs removed. Patient was initially on
propofol for sedation on the ventilator. CT head w/o contrast
showed cerebral edema. Neurosurgery placed ICP monitor and
patient treated with hypertonic saline. ICP was removed and
patient's mental status improved.
She was treated with NAC gtt and then stopped after liver
function started to recover. ARF (ATN) and was started on CVVH
and then HD with renal following her closely. She was weaned off
pressors and extubated. Continued on stress steroids given
ankylosing spondylitis. Patient transferred to [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**]
service for further management.
.
LIVER SERVICE hospital course:
# Liver failure: LFTs were AST/ALT = 45/108 wit tbili 6.8 on
transfer. They continued to trend down, and her synthetic
function was intact throughout. At the time of discharge, they
were AST/ALT = 28/24. Tbili = 2.8. Alk phos 256.
.
# Acute renal failure: Acute tubular necrosis from acetaminophen
overdose.
