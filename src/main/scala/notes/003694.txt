Chief Complaint:
feeling unwell


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Internal Jugular Line placement

History of Present Illness:
66 yo m with DM, h/o CAD s/p CABG with PCI in '[**99**], severe PVD,
CKD, and s/p Vfib arrest who presents with 1 day of vague
symptoms.  He reports that he started feeling unwell yesterday
afternoon with nausea, lightheadedness, and some shortness of
breath.  He denies chest pain or pressure, palpitations,
vomiting, sweating.  He was noted to be altered by his wife with
concern re: difficulty speaking, perhaps a left sided facial
droop and possible left hemianopsia, but limited evidence for
this.  The patient denies having any difficultly speaking or
visual changes, but says that he was confused and seeing things
that weren't there.  His wife reported to the neurologist that
he never had a facial droop.
.
He reports chronic DOE, no CP at rest or with exercise, +
claudication (calf pain) with ambulating 2 blocks, denies
orthopnea, sleeps on 4 pillows at night.  + PND.  He reports LE
edema at baseline.  He lost 10 lbs over past 3 months, which he
attributes to diet and exercise.

He initially went to an OSH, where CT head was negative.  He was
found to have new [**Last Name (un) **] and elevated cardiac enzymes.  He was
hypotensive at OSH to SBP 80s, started on peripheral dopamine
and sent to the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.9 86 94/45 on dopamine 20 95%.
He was also reporting worsening of chronic low back pain. His
exam was notable for [**3-11**] murmur, benign abdomen, rectal was
guaiac neg.  A bedside U/S in the ED was neg for pericardial
effusion.  Cardiology consult was requested for stat ECHO in ED,
to look for new WMA, but was not performed.  EKG was not felt to
be markedly changed from baseline.   There was some concern for
aortic aneurysm given back pain so he had a CT torso w/o
contrast, which was negative for aneurysm.  Vascular was
consulted and felt aortic dissection was unlikely.  Neurology
was consulted for concern re: TIA and they did not feel he had a
primary neurologic process.  Due to persistent hypotension, a
RIJ was placed and he was started on levofed.  He was not given
any antibiotics as he was afebrile without e/o infection.  VS
prior to transfer were 79 93/36 on levofed 0.12mcg, 18 99% on
3L.

Imaging:
carotid series: [**2204-4-9**]
1. Less than 40% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. 40-59% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
3. Reversal of flow in the right vertebral artery, suggestive of
subclavian steal.

Echo: [**2204-4-9**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with
global hypokinesis and apical akinesis. A left ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. There is no ventricular septal
defect. with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion

CT abdomen/ pelvis: [**2204-4-8**]
1. normal caliber thoracic and abdominal aorta. no hematoma
detected.
Dissection cannot be detected due to lack of IV contrast.
2. Unusually large appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary
signs of
appendicitis. This may represent a mucocele, and elective
resection should be considered.
3. Hyperdense right renal mass may represent a hemorrhagic cyst,
but this is incompletely evaluated with this technique. This can
be further assesed with ultrasound.
4. No acute intrathoracic, intraabdominal, or intrapelvic
process seen.
5. Enlarged pretracheal lymph node.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo m with DM, h/o CAD s/p CABG with PCI in '[**99**], severe PVD,
CKD, and s/p Vfib arrest who presents with 1 day of vague
symptoms found to have hypotension, [**Last Name (un) **] and elevated CE.

# Shock/Hypotension: On arrival to the ED, patient's exam was
most consistent with cardiogenic shock, with a prior known EF
25-30%. He had no evidence of sepsis or hypovolemia on exam. His
hypotension was likely triggered by new administration of
minoxidil causing hypotension and stress leading to stress and
demand ischemia.  Home BP medications were held, and he was
started on levophed with a goal MAP of 55-60.  On admission to
the MICU, an a-line was placed for monitoring of his blood
pressures. Overnight in the MICU he required increasing doses of
levophed to maintain blood pressure. His CE were trended,
showing elevation of troponin and mild elevation in CK in
setting of acute kidney injury and demand ischemia.  Repeat Echo
