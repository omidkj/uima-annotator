Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12131**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
73 year old woman with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma
with unknown primary currently on chemo and [**First Name3 (LF) 16859**] ([**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol
[**10-18**]) with recent long admission ([**Date range (1) 95163**]) for difficulty
ambulating c/b hyponatremia requiring ICU transfer for hypotonic
saline who is now presenting from her rehab facility for
worsening mental status.

Her medical history was obtained from her husband, her oncology
fellow, and records in OMR. She initially presented at the end
of [**Month (only) 216**] with bilateral hip pain with worsening LE edema and
LUE swelling. Studies revealed a right scapular mass which was
found to be adenocarcinoma. A workup for a primary tumor was
inconclusive but revealed a spot on her lung which was felt to
be the most likely candidate; a colonoscopy was incomplete, a
virtual colonoscopy was negative but suboptimal, a capsule study
was not done because of a hiatal hernia, and a mammogram was
negative.

The plan was for palliative chemo/[**Month (only) 16859**] for symptom management and
with the hope of adding some time to her life expectency. She
was discharged to rehab [**10-19**]. Since then they have been
monitoring her sodium levels closely. She was given 2 units of
pRBCs last week for worsening anemia after her chemotherapy. Her
oncology fellow was concerned that she was getting rectal meds
while neutropenic and asked them to start antibiotics which were
started yesterday (cipro).

According to her husband she has been taking poor PO for the
last several days and feeling progressively weaker. Today her
husband came in to visit her and noticed that she was stooping
over in her wheelchair with her head down and with her eyes
closed. When he went to talk to her she was only intermittently
responsive and oriented. They called her oncologist who
suggested she come in to the ED.

Review of records from her rehab facility show that in addition
to receiving MS contin 30mg [**Hospital1 **] regularly over the last several
days she also received 0.5mg of sublingual ativan on [**10-26**] at
12pm, 4mg of PO dilaudid on [**10-26**] at 4pm (hard to tell exact
time), 2mg of PO dilaudid on [**10-27**] at 5pm, and a compazine
suppository [**10-27**] at 3:30pm. According to the records she
received another 10mg of PO morphine at the rehab prior to their
calling EMS although this is not confirmed in the [**Month (only) 16**]. She also
was given the flu vaccine the afternoon of [**10-26**]. A course of
cipro was completed on [**10-27**] and then restarted later that day.

On arrival to the ED she triggered for hypotension to SBPs of 77
which were responsive to fluids with SBPs above 100 after. HRs
ranging 90-120. Afebrile. Her mental status was noted to be
somnolent but arousable to voice. She was seen in the ED by her
oncologist (fellow [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) who agreed that she was
significantly altered from before. Labs revealed neutropenia 57%
WBC 1.9 and hyponatremia (not as low as before). Since she is on
dagibotran a head CT was done which was negative. A CXR showed a
possible RLL opacification, blood cultures and urine cultures
were drawn and she was started on vanc and merepenem (has a
history of a cephalosporin allergy). She was admitted to the ICU
for MS monitoring. She received a total of 1.5L IVF in the ED.

He also notes that she has been vomiting (he thinks daily) since
her last chemotherapy 2 weeks ago. Last Tuesday she received 2
units of pRBCs at [**Hospital **] Hospital. According to her husband she
has not been complaining of pain for the last several days but
she has seemed more altered. He asked them to not give her too
much pain medication.

She and her husband have no children and he is her only
caregiver. She does have a sister, a [**Name2 (NI) 802**], and many friends. In
the ED her husband asked Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] how much time she has left.
She told him that that if she was not better in next few days
she would be worried that her symptoms are due to underlying
cancer and not just the chemotherapy and that this would mean a
worsening prognosis.
