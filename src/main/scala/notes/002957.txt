Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
Hyponatremia, Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
48yo F w/ HCV cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, ascites, edema/TIPS
[**11-8**], hydrothorax, thrombocytopenia, chronic hyponatremia
(baseline 124-128), adrenal insufficiency, GERD, anxiety
directly admitted for worsening hyponatremia.

Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency made [**12-12**] during
hospitalization for SOB, hyponatremia, fluid overload. Cortisol
[**2156-12-10**] was 0.1. At 30 min, cortisol was 1.6. at 60 min, cortisol
was 2.4. ACTH < 5. CBG [**2156-12-11**] 27 (nl). Endo Inpt consulting team
recommended stress dose steroids if needed but did not
recommended chronic replacement steroids as outpatient since she
was on inhaled steroids. Pt was seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10759**] on
[**2156-12-28**]. She noted that diagnosis of AI was based on
hyponatremia, relative hyperkalemia and eosinophilia. She did
note that HypoNa could be [**1-7**] third spacing [**1-7**] cirrhosis and
chronic diuretics. She noted that pt only had mildly orthostatic
symptoms but these were unchanged whether or not patient was on
oral steroids. She also noted that pt never had N, V, weight
loss, decreased appetite, hypotension. She did note that off
diuretics, patient became short of breath. She then repeated
cortisol and ACTH levels which were persistently low and
subsenquently started Prednisone 5 mg po qd.   Adrenal glands
were noted to be normal on abdominal US. Patient has most
recently been on Hydrocortisone 20 mg po q am and 10 mg po qhs.


On [**10-8**] Na 137, [**10-17**] Na 126, [**10-20**] Na 120 (OSH), [**10-24**] Na 115.
On [**10-20**], her diuretics were held [**1-7**] hyponatremia. She reports
good compliance with medical regimen and has been avoiding free
water. She reports compliance with her low salt diet. She has
had increasing dizziness, nausea, worsening LBP over the last
few days.

She arrived directly on the floor and labs showed the Na of 115.
She was transferred to the unit for closer monitoring and
potential need for hypertonic saline.

On admission to the unit, she reported dizziness, nausea, and
fatigue. She has had no seizure like activity or LOC. She denies
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], photophobia, CP, palpitations. With abdominal pain in
RUQ which is unchanged from previous. She denies any fevers,
chills.   Denied change in BMs (normally [**1-8**] daily). No
increased peripheral edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 48yo woman with history of HCV and ETOH induced cirrhosis
complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, s/p TIPS [**11-8**],
hydrothorax, thrombocytopenia, adrenal insufficiency, and
chronic hyponatremia admitted for worsening hyponatremia.

# Hyponatremia: Upon admission patient was noted to have sodium
of 115. She has been admitted multiple times with similar
problems.  [**Name (NI) **] was admitted to the ICU and improved with
3%NS and fluid restriction.  She has a long history of being
noncompliant with fluid restriction as an outpatient.  During
her hospital course her sodium slowly improved from 121-->
126--> 127.  Was continued on fluid restriction with continued
diuresis via lasix and spironolactone.  As there was also a
question that some of this could be adrenal insufficiency, she
was continued on [**Hospital1 **] hydrocortisone 20mg and 10mg for
physiologic dosing.  Briefly treated with IV lasix and albumin
with good effect.  Discharged on lasix, spironolactone and
1000ml fluid restriction.

# Hyperkalemia: Potassium initially elevated on admission to
5.8. No ECG changes.  Transtubular potassium gradient was
suggestive of hypoaldosteronism at 5.6. However, it was
difficult to determine TTKG in patient with decreased distal
delivery of sodium.  Ultimately it was unclear if patient is
truly adrenally insufficienct as hyponatremia is also result of
cirrhosis.  Resolved with treatment as described above.  Upon
discharge K was 4.0

# HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS [**11-8**] complicated by hydrothorax,
encephalopathy, ascites, and thrombocytopenia. T. Bili has
improved since prior admission and trending down upon this
admit.  ALT/AST, Alk phos, and amylase were increasingly
elevated with unclear etiology.  LFTs were trended and resolved
to baseline.  MELD calculated and found to be 20.  Was continued
on lactulose and rifaximin.  Continued on diuresis as described
above, with the brief addition of IV lasix.

# Vertebral compression fractures: Evaluated by IR for
vertebroplasty on last admission.  IR determined that she was
not to be candidate during this admission secondary to continued
coagulopathy.  Was continued on lidocaine transdermal patch, ice
packs, and oxycodone prn.  Also on MS contin [**Hospital1 **].  PT was
consulted and evaluated the patient, stating she was able to
discharge to home.  Did have acute episodes of increase pain,
but always relieved by oxycodone 5mg.  Patient was concerned
upon discharge that her pain would be difficult to control at
home as her mother is her primary caregiver and does not give
her PRNs.  Discussed at great length that we could not increase
scheduled as she becomes too somnolent and it is not safe.
Discharged on MS contin and oxycodone for breakthrough.

# History of Adrenal Insufficiency:  Upon evaluation she had no
sodium wasting in urine or othrostatic hypotension.  Potassium
levels were noted to be fluctuating.  Hydrocortisone continued
at physiologic dosing.  To follow-up with Endocrine as an
outpatient.

# Asthma: Not an active inpatient issue, continued on inhalers.

# Type 2, DM: Managed as on outpatient with humalog ISS and
glargine.  While in patient her glargine and ISS were adjusted
for improved glycemic control.  Discharged on both these
medications.
