Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 84700**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital6 5016**]
after a fall from her chair in which she hit her head. She
sustained a 4cm laceration to her left forehead which was
sutured at [**Hospital3 **]. C-spine of her neck was negative for any
acute trauma. Head CT showed a 4mm subdural hematoma; and
shoulder films showed a left proximal humeral head fracture. At
[**Hospital1 18**], she was followed by the Trauma, Orthopedics, and
Neurosurgery services. She received repeat films of her head,
shoulder, and tibula/fibula; which revealed no acute change in
her subdural hematoma, and revealed a mild incomplete fracture
of her mid tibia on the left in addition to the left humeral
head fracture. She remained in minimal pain through her hospital
course, complaing of [**3-19**] pain at times, well-controlled with
acetaminophen and morphine. Orthopedics felt this injury was
non-operable and would benefit most from a sling. Given her
intact mental status and negative head CTs, Neurosurgery felt
she was stable for discharge. She was evaluated by Physical
Therapy, who also cleared her for discharge, as she is able to
ambulate and needs minimal assistance with her left arm, which
is currently in a sling. She should followup with her PCP to
have her stitches removed, and with the neurosurgery and
orthopedics services.
