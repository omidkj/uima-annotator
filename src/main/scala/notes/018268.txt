History of Present Illness:
This ia a 41 year old G4P3 right handed female who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 27778**] hospital after she
developed a frontal headache the day prior. She was at a store
with her family and the headache intensified over 15 min to
maximal severity and she also developed blurred vision to the
point where she could not see anything. She denied nausea,
vomiting, abnormal movements, loss
of bowel or bladder function. The blurred vision gradually
resolved, but she maintained a headache, and was unable to fall
asleep secondary to her headache.

MRI/MRA imaging was concerning for intracranial hemorrhage with
extention into the ventricles and possible visualization of an
ACOM aneurysm.

Patient estimated that she is 7 weeks pregnant at time of
admission.

Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger

ON DISCHARGE:
Prefers her eyes closed and prefers to lay on left side
Follows commands on right side to show fingers or wiggle toes
Will nod head appropriately to orientation questions about her
name, location and family questions about names of her husband
and children. Is not orientated to date
Motor: Appears full and spontaneous on RUE and RLE. LLE triple
flexion. LUE + grasp to command.
Pupils are equal bilaterally

On Discharge:
EO to voice. Pupils are equal and reactive but patient typically
refuses. Nonverbal but nods head appropiately to questions. She
follows commands with the right side. RUE/RLE spont and
purposeful. LUE flexion, has begun to show intermitted spont
movement. LLE weak withdrawl to pain. Head incisions are C/D/I
with sutures. Bilateral groin sites remain hard but have been
improving.
In general she is oriented to name / hospital / yr / husbands
name / will be able to relaibly tell you she has pain and where
when directed / she frowns when in pain or sad.  She has been
interactive with her children when the visit ie patting her
little ones head when he stood on her right side.


Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2128-1-19**]
Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, small foci of
intraventricular hemorrhage,

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2128-1-20**]
MRA BRAIN:
There is an apparent small outpouching versus aneurysm directed
posteriorly
(series 4- image 91) in the right supraclinoid ICA measuring
approximately 1 mm. The right MCA bifurcation has a bulbous
appearance, a normal variant. The intracranial vessels are
otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
Abnormal signal in the subarachnoid space and in the ventricular
system that may represent hemorrhage or pus. Tiny outpouching
versus aneurysm directed posteriorly in the right supraclinoid
ICA. No other vascular abnormalities are detected.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2128-1-21**]
1. New region of acute hemorrhage, with both intra- and
extra-axial
components, immediately adjacent to the right cavernous sinus.
This is in
close proximity to a focal outpouching of the cavernous segment
of the right internal carotid artery.Given the original
presentation, and the lack of other ready explanation, this
finding must be regarded as suspicious for aneurysmal rupture.
There may also be transependymal extension of this hemorrhage
into the lateral ventricles.

2. Possible distal right vertebral artery pseudoaneurysm
corresponding to a focal outpouching as seen on recent
angiography.

3. Decreased extent of subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the
bilateral
frontoparietal convexities, with no new focus of subarachnoid
blood, other
than above.

4. Prominence of the lateral ventricles, bilaterally, not
significantly
changed.

5. No evidence of subfalcine, uncal or transtentorial herniation


CT Head [**2128-1-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
No significant short-interval changes of the known
intraparenchymal and
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Persistent bilateral intraventricular
hemorrhage in the occipital horns but without developing
hydrocephalus. No definite
evidence of new foci of intracranial hemorrhage. No midline
shift.

CTA Head [**2128-1-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. New right middle cerebral artery infarct involving the
temporal lobe as
well as basal ganglia region on the right with decrease in size
of the flow voids, indicative of vasospasm.
2. Blood products are again seen in the right suprasellar region
and adjacent brain along with blood products in the ventricles
and sulci from subarachnoid hemorrhage.
3. A new small infarct is identified in the right cerebellum
since the
previous MRI examination.
4. Other areas of increased signal on diffusion images along the
sulci appear to be secondary to subarachnoid blood.
5. Mild ventriculomegaly with the ventricular size slightly
decreased from
previous MRI examination and stable from CT of [**2128-1-22**].

CT Head [**2128-1-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. A focus of hemorrhage by the right cavernous sinus is
unchanged.
2. Persistent but less conspicuous subarachnoid blood within the
right frontal
lobe.
3. Continued blood layering within the occipital horns.
4. A small focus of hemorrhage adjacent to the left cavernous
sinus is not
well visualized on the current exam.

Bil Lower Ext Dopplers [**2128-1-26**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

CTA Head [**2128-1-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Continued evolution of a large right MCA territorial
infarction, without evidence of hemorrhagic transformation,
midline shift or herniation.
2. Continued retraction of a clot adjacent to the right
cavernous sinus, as well as residual subarachnoid hemorrhage and
intraventricular hemorrhage. No evidence of new hemorrhage.
3. Diffuse vasospasm of the anterior and posterior ci
