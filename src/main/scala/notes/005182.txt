Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-4-3**]: ERCP with sphicterotomy and sphincteroplasty

History of Present Illness:
67 yo M with COPD on 2L home O2, CHF, Afib not on Coumadin,
pacemaker, DM2 presenting with abdominal pain. He had 3 episodes
of abdominal discomfort over the past couple of months, each
lasting for hours, associated with yawning, and without any
clear association with meals. The patient developed severe
abdominal pain during dinner last night at around 9 p.m. When he
tried to get up, he became dizzy and had to lie down. He had one
episode of non-bloody emesis and presented to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital for
further evaluation.
.
The patient reports abdominal pain as his primary symptoms, but
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital records, dyspnea was his chief complaint
there. At [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital, the patient was found to be hypotensive
to the 70s. His blood pressure rapidly improved with IV fluids.
Labs showed creat 1.2, Dbili 0.6, tbili 1.3, AST 182, ALT 137,
amylase 1819, lipase >3000, troponin T 0.02 (neg), wbc 22, hct
46.5, plt 271 INR 0.96, digoxin 1.06, u/a neg. ABG 7.36/69/74 on
2L NC. CT chest/abdomen with IV contrast showed non specific
gallbladder wall thickening, mild to moderate fluid and
stranding around the pancreas, no PE. The patient was given
Unasyn, Flagyl, levalbuterol, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV,
Zofran, and fentanyl, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], initial vital signs were 98.1 75 133/65 20 99% 2L.
Labs were notable for WBC 18.9, Cr 1.5, ALT 202, AST 289, AP
202, lipase 2527, lactate 1.2. Abdominal ultrasound showed
gallbladder filled with stones, with limited assessment of
gallbladder wall due to stones, equivocal son[**Name (NI) 867**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**]
signs due to diffuse abdominal tenderness, and a CBD that was
dilated to 8 mm. Surgery was consulted and recommended ERCP, IV
fluids, antibiotics, with likely cholecystectomy in the future.
He was given morphine 4 mg IV and Unasyn 3 gm IV.
.
On transfer to the ICU, vital signs were 127/54, 76, 20, 99% 3L
nc. He has 2 18-gauge peripheral IVs for access.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient complaind of abdominal pain.
He denies nausea, but has had a total of 2 episodes of
non-bloody emesis, one at home and one in the ED. He had a soft
BM this a.m. He had some shortness of breath initially but now
feels that his breathing is at baseline.

IMAGING:
[**2169-4-3**] abdominal ultrasound:
1. Thick walled contracted gallbladder filled with stones and
sludge. No
evidence of acute cholecystitis.
2. Dilated common bile duct measuring 8 mm.
3. Pancreas not visualized due to overlying midline bowel gas.

[**2169-4-5**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-3**], the patient
has taken a
better inspiration. Continued enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette without definite pulmonary vascular congestion.
Probable small effusions on the lateral view. Some increased
opacification at the left base medially is consistent with
atelectatic change. Pacer device remains in place.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo M with COPD on 2L home O2, CHF, DM2, pacemaker, presents
with shortness of breath and abdominal pain, with laboratory
data and imaging studies concerning for gallstone pancreatitis.

# Pancreatitis: Likely related to gallstones. CBD diameter of 8
mm is concerning for obstruction. ERCP and surgery were
consulted in emergency department, and patient underwent ERCP
with sphincterotomy/sphicteroplasty and removal of 8 stones and
sludge. He was started and continued on Unasyn for abdominal
flora. He was started on IVF for his pancreatitis and his pain
was controlled with dilaudid prn. Following ERCP he did well and
had improved abdominal pain. His pain was controlled and he
tolerated clear liquids well without nausea or emesis.
Following discharge from Rehab he should follow-up with the ACS
service for a outpatient cholecystectomy.

# Post pancreatitis ileus
The patient had significant abdominal distention following his
transfer out of the ICU without abdominal pain.  An bowel
regimen was started and he began to move his bowels.  His diet
was slowly advanced and he tolerated a regular diet prior to
discharge.

#Persistent leukocytosis
The patients peak WBC was 34K and gradually trended down.  On
[**2169-4-7**] the patient's empiric unasyn was stopped due to no
obvious source of infection.  His WBC continued to slowly trend
down.

# COPD: Patient is currently without respiratory distress, and
he says his breathing is at baseline. However, he appears mildly
dyspneic. He was placed on tiotropium and advair and his
respiratory status stablized. On the day of discharge his serum
HCO3 was elevated, likely reflecting increased CO2 retention in
the setting of increased oxygen via nasal cannula the previous
day in response to some subjective dyspnea in the absence of
hypoxia. His supplemental O2 should be titrated to O2 saturation
in the low 90s given his COPD.

# Guaiac positive stools, anemia: Patient's Hct slowly trended
down from admission in the setting of aggressive volume
repletion. As he has recently established care with a new PCP
his baseline Hct is unknown. He was noted to have guaiac
positive stools, but did not have any episodes of melena. He
will need outpatient work-up including colonoscopy when he has
recovered from his acute illness.

# CHF: In the setting of pancreatitis, patient requires
aggressive hydration and his volume status was monitored given
pt's history of CHF.  He was clinically monitored for fluid
overload and his home furosemide, lisinopril and coreg were
initially held in setting of pancreatitis and recent episodes of
hypotension.  A TTE was done on the floor which revealed a
normal EF and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  His home
medications were resumed once he was transitioned to PO intake
and tolerating diet without pain or GI symptoms. He had
borderline low blood pressures, and so his Lisinopril is
currently at 5mg, de
