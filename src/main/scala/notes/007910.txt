History of Present Illness:
76yoM with h/o vascular dementia, PVD, CKD, AAA, h/o PE s/p IVC
filter, AFib s/p PPM on Coumadin, COPD, critical AS ([**Location (un) 109**] < 0.8)
who presented to [**Location (un) 620**] after feeling unwell after dinner last
night. Pt is very poor historian due to baseline dementia.

His wife reports that they ate dinner last night and after he
felt "woozy" but was unable to more fully qualify it; he was
pointing to his abdomen though. He went to bed at 9pm (early for
him) and woke up this morning. He had difficulty putting his
pants on, which is different for him, and complained of
abdominal pain, possibly in the RUQ, but the history is not very
specific. They went to BIDN where he had an RUQ ultrasound which
showed pericholecystic fluid that was concerning for GB
carcinoma. He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further w/u. There, he
received Cipro/Flagyl and 2L NS. Lowest blood pressure there was
90.

In the ED initial vitals: 98.2 88 113/78 12 100%. No abdominal
pain here. Ultrasound done at the bedside in ED was conerning
for GB stone and sludge and incidentally noted a pericardial
effusion with RV collapse. Surgery and Cards were both
consulted. He was given a nicotine patch and 5mg Zyprexa for
agitation

AT [**Hospital1 18**], he was noted to have [**Last Name (un) **] which was thought to be
hypovolemic and creatinine improved with intravenous fluids. He
was given vitamin k 5 mg po x for elevated INR and subsequently
underwent pericardiocentesis.

In the Cath Lab, he underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage
of blood fluid and decrease of pressure from 18 mmHg to
negative. TTE pre-pericardiocentesis showed wire/catheter in
anterior pericardial space but EKG showed few ventricular pacing
capture beats. Post-pericardiocentesis TTE showed no residual
pericardial effusion.

TTE ([**2203-5-9**])
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
probably moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Tissue synchronization imaging
demonstrates significant left ventricular dyssynchrony with the
lateral wall contracting significantly later than the septum. RV
with normal free wall contractility. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion which is circumfirential and fairly clear.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is brief
right atrial diastolic collapse.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-4-26**], the
LVEF has decreased and the pericardial effusion is new. The
degree of AS is probably similar.

IMPRESSION: Moderate pericardial effusion. Elevated
intrapericardial pressure without overt tamponade. Moderate AS.
Depressed LVEF with dysynchron (pacing induced).

RUQ US ([**2203-5-9**])
Markedly thickened gallbladder wall and thickened septum through
the
apparent center of the gallbladder with areas of internal
vascularity, highly concerning for gallbladder malignancy.
Cholelithiasis and possible very trace to zero pericholecystic
fluid. Again, if there is concern for acute cholecystitis, a
HIDA scan can be considered.

Pericardial Fluid cytology ([**2203-5-11**]) showed ...

Pericardiocentesis ([**2203-5-11**])
1. Pericardial access was obtained via the sub-xiphoid approach.
The
pericardial fluid was sanguinous. Injection of contrast into the

pericardial space showed the effusion to be freely flowing and
non-loculated. Initial mean pressure of the pericardium upon
entrance
was 17 mmHg which went down to a mean of 2 mmHg after drainage
of
pericardial fluid.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Tamponade physiology which resolved with drainage of
pericardial
fluid.

CT Abdomen ([**2203-5-12**])
1. Obstructing stone in the distal common bile duct at the level
of the
ampulla. No evidence for mass
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
3. Fatty infiltration of the liver.
4. Multiple hypodense lesions in both kidneys. A lesion in the
left upper
pole measures higher density and may represent a complex cyst.
It is seen
anteriorly and measures 2.7 cm in size. A second lesion on the
left measuring 7.2 cm also demonstrates increased density (20
[**Doctor Last Name **]). Confirmation of the cystic nature of these lesions with
ultrasound is recommended.
5. Infrarenal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.7 cm.
6. Small amount of ascites.
7. Diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.

CTA coronaries ([**2203-5-12**])
Evaluation of the pacemaker leads demonstrate that the right
pacemaker lead is minimally perforating the right atrial
anterior wall, 6A:102, with its most distal tip being within the
pericardial space. No acute extravasation has been demonstrated.
