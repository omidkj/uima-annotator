BRAIN MRI:

The diffusion images demonstrate an acute infarct involving the
left middle cerebral artery with mild mass effect on the left
lateral ventricle. There are mild-to-moderate periventricular
changes of small vessel disease seen. There is no midline shift
or hydrocephalus. There is mild-to-moderate brain atrophy seen.
There is evidence of increased signal seen in the pons
indicative of small vessel disease. No definite slow diffusion
seen in the pons to indicate pontine infarct.
Note is made of absence of flow void in the left cavernous
carotid artery, which could be due to occlusion in the neck.
IMPRESSION: Acute left MCA infarct with mild mass effect on the
left lateral ventricle. Absent flow void in the left carotid
artery.

MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates absence of flow signal in the left
internal carotid artery. The left MCA is faintly visualized on
the source images, most likely secondary to collaterals from the
anterior communicating and left posterior communicating artery.
The right internal carotid, right middle cerebral, and both
anterior cerebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal.
In the posterior circulation, distal left vertebral artery
appears to be ending in posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
The right distal vertebral, basilar, and both posterior cerebral
arteries demonstrate normal flow signal.
IMPRESSION: Non-visualization of the left internal carotid
artery, likely secondary to occlusion in the neck. Faint flow
signal indicating diminished flow is seen within the left middle
cerebral artery.

TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an
E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

EEG:
This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of sharp and
sharp and slow wave discharges seen over the right frontal
region and due to a slow and disorganized background rhythm with
multifocal polymorphic slowing in the delta frequency range.
Additionally, there is an increased voltage gradient over the
left fronto-temporal region. The first abnormality suggests a
cortical dysfunction in the right frontal region. The second
abnormality represents a mild encephalopathy. There was no clear
seizure activity recorded, however, and post-ictal events cannot
be excluded.



Brief Hospital Course:
1. Stroke: The pt was found to have aphasia and a right
hemiparesis at an outside hospital. She was intubated and
transferred here for further management. A head CT was obtained
which showed a large left MCA distribution stroke.  An MRI was
then performed which showed the left MCA stroke as well as an
occluded [**Doctor First Name 3098**] in the neck.  This was felt to be an acute event
which led to her stroke.  As for the reason for the embolus, the
patient had a TTE which showed LVH, but no thrombus or valvular
lesions.  She was monitored on telemetry and shown to have
intermittent AF which was not previously known.  This is likely
the reason for her embolus.  Carotid arteries were not evaluated
with Doppler given the known [**Doctor First Name 3098**] occlusion and the fact that
her source was almost certainly her heart.

Given the large size of her stroke, she was not placed on
coumadin/heparin. She was started on ASA 300 mg daily instead.
She was also started on Lipitor.  After several days, she was
also started on heparin sq when this was deemed safe.

She remained intubated and not attempting to answer questions
while in the ICU.  She had no spontaneous mov
