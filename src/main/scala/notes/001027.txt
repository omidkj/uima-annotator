to [**Hospital6 4287**] initially on [**5-22**] with symptomatic
bradycardia. She had some flushing, warmth, palpitations and
abdominal discomfort (initially she attributed this to Thai food
which is unusual for her to eat).
.
At [**Hospital3 **] she was noted to have complete heart block with a
rate of 38. Her rhythm improved slowly to 1:1 conduction and she
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for continued medication washout. (she
was on lopressor 100mg po qam and 150mg po qpm).
.
She states prior to her admission she felt palpitations while
changing and getting ready for bed, she said her pulse was fast
and would skip a beat every 4 or so beats. She did not feel
presyncope, no sycope then or recently. She felt warm and asked
her husband to call 911. She denies CP. She has had DOE upon
ambulation > 1 block x 1 week, stable [**2-26**] pillow orthopnea, no
PND, no leg edema. Her normal weight is 136-139 lbs, current
weight is 141.5 lbs. No abdominal pain, one episode of diarrhea
in the hospital the day prior to transfer to the [**Hospital1 **].
.
Initial VS: 98.3 38 150/50 12 100% RA
Transfer VS: 39 151/55 17 99% RA
.
In the ER she was given calcium gluconate 2g for CCB reversal
(also on nifedipine). She was admitted from the ER to the floor
with a diagnosis of 2:1 block and bradycardia, but a normal
blood pressure. Upon transfer from the ER stretcher to her floor
bed she was noted to become more bradycardia, from a rate of 40
to 28. Her block had worsened from 2:1 to 3:1. Her SBP was 150.
She had been experiencing nausea for 1 hour prior to her
transfer (after taking aspirin).

Renal ultrasound [**2155-5-26**]:
HISTORY: 53-year-old woman with renal transplant.
COMPARISON: Renal ultrasound, [**2152-5-24**].
FINDINGS: Renal ultrasound was performed of the renal transplant
in the left hemipelvis. The renal transplant measures 12.3 cm.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid.
  Doppler evaluation of the transplant shows symmetric flow
through the kidney, and resistive indices range from 0.85 at the
upper pole, 0.82 to 0.88 at the mid pole, and 0.81 to 0.83 at
lower pole, and in the main renal artery of 0.89. Normal flow is
seen in the renal vein.
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight increase in resistive indices in all poles of the
transplant kidney compared to prior study, now ranging from 0.81
to 0.89.
2. No hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid.
.

CXR [**2155-5-24**]:
FINDINGS: Left-sided permanent pacemaker is present, with leads
terminating
in the right atrium and right ventricle, with no visible
pneumothorax. Heart remains enlarged, and there is mild
pulmonary vascular congestion. Small pleural effusion is
demonstrated on the right. Bones are demineralized and
demonstrate mild decreased height in the mid thoracic spine
without change since [**2154-3-13**].
IMPRESSION:
1. Pacing leads in standard position with no pneumothorax.
2. Mild CHF.
.
EP: placement of [**Company 1543**] ADAPTA [**Company **]


Brief Hospital Course:
#Complete Heart Block s/p [**Name (NI) 19721**]
Pt was admitted from [**Hospital6 2561**] with bradycardia,
found to be complete heart block at rate of 38. Received Calcium
IV. to reverse calcium channel blocker and beta blocker was
discontinued. Pt rec'd a BiV [**Hospital6 **] on [**2155-5-23**] with no
complications. Her Nifedipine and Metoprolol was resumed after
the [**Date Range **] was placed for BP control. She will follow up at the
device clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] 1 week after placement and with her
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for continued treatment of her CAD and
hypertension. Activity restrictions were reviewed with pt before
discharge.

#Acute on chronic Renal Failure s/p Transplant: Creatinine
increased to max of 2.4 during hospital stay and was 2.0 at
discharge. It was thought that she was pre-renal and her lasix
was initially held. She was followed by the renal transplant
team and her Prograf was decreased for high levels. She will be
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge and her creatinine and
prograf level will be checked at her device appt. Bactrim and
Prednisone was continued at previous dose.

#Acute on Chronic Diastolic congestive Heart Failure:
Fluid overload on lung exam over course of hospitalization in
setting of acute renal failure. Responded well to low dose IV
lasix. PO Lasix was restarted before discharge. Weight at
discharge was 64.7 kg.

#Hyperglycemia
 [**3-4**] A1C 7.4, likely due to dietary indiscretion. Insulin
regimen from home was continued during hospital stay.

#Hypertension: Pt was restarted on previous doses of Nifedipine
and Metoprolol after pacemaker was placed. Clonidine was
decreased to 0.1 mg daily.
