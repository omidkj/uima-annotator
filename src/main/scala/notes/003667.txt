Chief Complaint:
altered mental status
fever
acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mid-line IV


History of Present Illness:
41yo woman w/ PMH hypothyroidism, s/p laparoscopic
cholecystectomy and umbilical hernia repair [**2125-6-27**] at [**Hospital1 89097**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with fever, acute renal failure
and mental status changes.
.
She was originally admitted [**6-26**] with recurrent biliary colic
and had a laparascopic cholecystectomy with concurrent repair of
an umbilical hernia. Intraoperatively she had a bile leak that
was controlled with small clips and a JP drain was left in
place. During that admission she apparently had malignant
hypertension thought to be due to self-induced hyperthyroidism
(?). She had ERCP showing peripheral bile leak, with
sphincterotomy and placement of a stent. She then improved and
was discharged home [**7-1**].
.
She was seen as an outpatient [**7-8**] when she was doing well,
except for pain at the JP site. [**7-12**] she was readmitted b/c of
persistent abdominal pain. Repeat ERCP and MRCP showed no leak,
though a HIDA scan showed pooling of small amounts of bile in
the peripheral of the liver. [**7-14**] and [**7-15**] she spiked fevers.
She was thought to have cellulitis around the JP site, and the
bile grew [**Last Name (LF) 8974**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was started on oxacillin with removal of
the JP drain. She subsequently developed a small biloma. She
began to develop acute kidney injury with rising creatinine.
[**7-18**], she had WBC 13.3, BUN 8, Cr 4.8, total bili 4.3. She also
had R UQ pain. CVL was placed. CT scan of the abd and pelvis
showed the small biloma and severe right sided colitis. No
biliary duct obstruction. The decision was made to transfer her
to the [**Hospital1 18**] SICU.
.
On arrival to the SICU, the surgery team did not feel that her
biloma was her primary issue and that she did not require
surgical intervention. They requested transfer to the medical
team. The patient is intermittently oriented to place and year.
She is confused and agitated and unable to provide further
history. It is unclear when her confusion began as it is not
mentioned in the OSH notes.

Brief Hospital Course:
41 yo female s/p lap CCY/bile leak transferred from OSH.
Hospitalization notable for fevers, transient cholestasis
(resolved), [**Month/Day/Year 8974**] recovery from biliary drainage, AMS, ARF
(attributed to AIN). Showed significant Right sided colitis on
recent abdominal CT.  Pt's course was complicated by HAP.

AMS: Mental status changes were worked up for toxic, metabolic
and infectious etiologies.   It was determined that her mental
status changes were due to accumulation of benzodiazepines and
narcotics in the setting of acute renal failure.  When the
offending substances were removed and pt's renal function
improved, her mental status returned to baseline.  Pt does have
history of alcohol abuse, but had not drank within past week
prior to admission and she never showed signs of EtOH
withdrawal.

Acute renal failure:  Pt was admitted with creatinine of 3.7.
In outside hospital, injury was attributed to nafcillin AIN.  On
admission, pt was found to be hypovolemic and was resuscitated
with fluids in the ICU.  Her kidney function improved, but she
began putting out large volumes of urine when she arrived on the
floor.  Based on urine lytes with FeUrea consistent with
intrinsic failure it was determined that she was experiencing
post ATN diuresis.  During this time, she was found to be
hypokalemic from the copious diuresis.  K was replaced, urine
output decreased and creatinine continued to improve by time of
discharge.  She was discharged with Cr of 1.8, and pt had good
urine output.  Baseline creatinine was unknown.

Hyperkalemia:  In ICU pt was found to be hyperkalemic.  EKG
showed no signs of hyperkalemia, was given kayexalate and K
trended down as kidney function improved.

Hospital acquired PNA:  In SICU, pt was found to have right
lobar PNA, was febrile with leukocytosis and cough with SOB.
She could not produce sufficient sputum sample for culture and
all blood cultures were negative, so she was treated empirically
for HAP with cefepime and vancomycin for a 10 day course.  She
was discharged with a midline IV to complete the final four days
of ABX therapy with VNA services.

Colitis: In ICU pt developed watery diarrhea.  On admission she
had abdominal pain and outside CT showed pericolic stranding.
An infectious process associated with previous cholecystectomy
and JP tube was ruled out in the ICU with U/S and neg cultures
from JP site.  Pt also had leukocytosis and was suspected to
have c. diff and started on empiric PO vancomycin and flagyl.
She had three negative c diff toxin assays and diarrhea and
abdominal pain resolved.  Symptoms were likely caused by
intra-abdominal inflammation secondary to bile leak and small
biloma.

Hypertension:  On floor, the pt was found to be consistently
hypertensive with systolic pressures in the 160s.  She reported
that her PCP has diagnosed her
