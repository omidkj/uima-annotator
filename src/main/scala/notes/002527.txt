Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
ETOH withdrawal seizure, c. diff diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated prior to hospital transfer.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of alcoholism,
alcoholic withdrawal, and possible seiziure disorder and on
Keppra. The patient reports to her PCP in the setting of recent
increase in alcohol use, although her tox screens have evidently
been negative for alcohol and it is unknown when her last drink
was. The patient had an episode of tremulousness and a staring
episode at her PCP's office, for which she was transferred to
[**Hospital 4199**] Hospital. At [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital, she experienced a
generalized seizure for approximately 20 minutes, for which she
was given Versed, Ativan, magnesium.  The patient was intubated
and given some Ativan and midazolam. She has been on propofol
for sedation since. The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4199**] hospital non-contrast
head CT was negative for acute intracranial process. The patient
received 1g Keppra.
.
In the ED, the patient's initial neurological exam was nonfocal.
Neurology was consulted. An EEG was obtained which showed no
status and changes consistent with her propofol sedation. The
patient spiked a temperature of 102 in the ED and received
acetaminophen. An LP was then obtained, along with a
non-contrast head CT. She was also started on 2g ceftriaxone for
possible meningitis. The patient's potassium, calcium, and
magnesium were all replenished. Her NG tube was advanced. The
patient is currentl sedated with a propofol drip.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is sedated on propofol and
intubated. She appears to be quite cachectic. Her heart rate is
in the 80s, blood pressure systolic low 100s, diastolic low 60s.

Images:
OSH Head CT: 1. No intracranial hemorrhage or acute fracture.
Chronic involutional changes.
2. Moderate paranasal sinus opacification, secondary to
intubation.
[**2100-12-24**] EEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the
presence of a
diffusely slow background consistent with a moderate to severe
encephalopathy which is etiologically non-specific. There was
also
superimposed generalized, frontally predominant beta frequency
activity
likely due to medication effects such as benzodiazepines or
barbiturates. There were no clear electrographic seizures or
epileptiform discharges.
[**2100-12-24**] ECG: rate 96, sinus arrhythmia. Poor R wave
progression. No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**2100-12-24**] CXR: 1. Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
2. Nasogastric tube high in position, terminating in the distal
esophagus.  Recommend advancement so that it is well within the
stomach.
3. Hyperinflated but clear lungs.
4. Subacute-to-old left ninth rib fracture with opacity
projecting over it, which is felt to more likely be related to
osseous change. Recommend
comparison with priors and if the opacity has increased,
consider chest CT to evaluate for underlying pulmonary nodule.
5. Old fracture deformity and severe degenerative change at the
right
shoulder with possible loose body.
[**2100-12-24**] Head CT: 1. No intracranial hemorrhage or acute
fracture. Chronic involutional changes.
2. Moderate paranasal sinus opacification, secondary to
intubation.
[**2100-12-25**] Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in
comparison to [**2100-12-24**]. The ET tube tip is 6 cm above
the carina. The NG tube is coiled in the proximal stomach
continuing up towards the esophagus with its tip being at the
level of the distal esophagus and should be readjusted.  The
heart size and mediastinum are unremarkable. Lungs are
hyperinflated but essentially clear. Calcified right
paratracheal lymph node is unchanged in appearance. Old rib
fractures are noted on the left. Overall, within the limitations
of this study technique, no other abnormalities are
demonstrated.
