Chief Complaint:
Difficulty breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80-year-old woman with DM, HTN, COPD, and obesity
recently discharged from [**Hospital6 4620**] on [**2160-1-30**]
for hypercarbic respiratory failure and sepsis (from ?skin
source) who is admitted from [**Hospital3 2558**] with fatigue and
shortness of breath.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to NWH on [**2160-1-15**] after being
found down at home and unresponsive.  She was admitted to the
MICU at NWH and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
There was concern for sepsis given elevated WBC and chance in
mental status, and patient was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics.  A throrough infectious work-up at NWH was
unrevealing, and the cause of sepsis was thought to be skin
breakdown sustained during fall at home.  She was treated with
broad spectrum antibiotics and eventually extubated.  Developed
ARF and was temporarily on HD, but recovered and was not
discharged with RRT.  Hospital course was also significant for
afib with RVR, for which patient was started on amiodarone.  She
also suffered a hct drop while on a heparin gtt, attributed to
peptic ulcer and as such was not discharged on anticoagulation.
.
At rehab on date of admission, patient was found to have labored
breathing, hypoxia, and difficulty clearing secretions.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  In the ED, initial
vitals were: 98.5, 78, 100/50, 28.  An ABG was significant for:
7.30/74/153.  Hct was 24.8 (down from a hct of 28 on discharge
from OSH), bicarb 35, and creatinine 1.8.  Patient was
transferred to the MICU for respiratory distress.

Past Medical History:
--Hypertension
--Obesity
--Lumbar spinal stenosis
--Paroxysmal afib
--COPD (though no PFTs)
--Former tobacco use
--Chronic renal insufficiency

Social History:
Used to live by herself before recent hospitalization, long
smoking history.

Family History:
NC

IMAGING:
CXR [**2160-2-7**] Moderate cardiomegaly is noted. Flattening of
diaphragms is suggestive of hyperinflation likely representing
chronic obstructive lung disease. There is no evidence of focal
consolidation, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Moderate cardiomegaly but no acute
cardiopulmonary process.
.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2160-2-9**]: Dilated and hypokinetic
right ventricle with moderate tricuspid regurgitation and severe
pulmonary hypertension. Normal regional and global left
ventricular systolic function. Indeterminate diastolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. There is a mobile echodensity seen on
the supra-sternal notch views (66-70). It is unclear which blood
vessel this is in - if in PA, it could be a thrombus. If in
aorta, suspect a mobile atheroma.
.
Bilateral lower extremity venous dopplers [**2160-2-9**]- negative for
DVT
.
Unilateral upper extremity venous dopple [**2160-2-10**]- negative for
DVT
.
CTA [**2160-2-16**]-
1. Evaluation of distal segmental and subsegmental pulmonary
arteries is limited by motion; however, no central pulmonary
embolism identified.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, left
greater than right.
3. Emphysematous changes with bilateral upper lobe predominance.

4. 6 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule. Follow up CT in [**7-15**]
months is
recommended.
.
Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2160-2-21**]: The left atrium is
elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate to severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion.
  IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
Hypertrophied and dilated right ventricle with mild systolic
dysfunction. Normal global and regional left ventricular
systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.
  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-2-9**],
estimated pulmonary pressures are slightly lower. The other
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for
COPD, HTN, paroxysmal afib, obesity, and former tobacco abuse
who presented with shortness of breath.
.
# Respiratory distress- Patient admitted to MICU with hypoxia
and shortness of breath.  This was initially attributed to COPD
exacerbation, though patient does not carry a diagnosis of COPD.
 She was placed on azithromycin/prednisone and Bipap. On HD1,
she developed acute hypoxia and dyspnea, with CXR evidence of
flash pulmonary edema.  She was diuresed and weaned off of
bipap.  Prior to transfer to the floor, TTE showed evidence of
RV overload and severe pulmonary hypertension, new in comparison
to TTE done during OSH admission in mid-[**Month (only) 1096**].  Concern was
high for PE, so patient was started on heparin gtt, however CTA
was deferred in the setting of decreased renal function and V/Q
would not have been informative given abnormalities on CXR.
There was no evidence of upper or lower extremity venous
thrombosis.  Once creatinine improved, CTA showed no central
embolism, but motion artifact prevented evaluation for
segmental/subsegmental PE.  However, pati
