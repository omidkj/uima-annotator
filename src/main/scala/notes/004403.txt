History of Present Illness:
Please see the medicine nightfloat admission note for full
details. In brief, this is an 81yo man w/ systolic/diastolic CHF
(EF 45%, dry weight 215lbs in [**Month (only) **]), HTN, Afib on coumadin and
vascular dementia, admitted for altered mental status, this
morning being transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.
.
He was last well about 10 days ago when he initially had urinary
retention c/b UTI and altered mental status. He improved quickly
with antibiotics and went to rehab on PO antibiotics. [**2133-5-8**] he
had low BPs and altered mental status. CXR showed PNA, and he
was started on ceftriaxone/azithro with improvement. Yesterday
morning he was again altered, could not get out of bed, and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED he triggered for hypoxia that improved with 6L O2 by
NC. Given vanc/levo/flagyl. Trop 0.08 and BNP >9000. Given ASA,
but not Lasix because of concern for infection/sepsis. On the
floor overnight he was appearing improved and was given lasix
20mg IV x1. He had an unwitnessed fall early this morning and
was found on the ground. At 7am he was again hypoxic with an
arterial P02 59 on a non-rebreather. He is profoundly confused,
oriented x0 and having trouble speaking.
.
Speaking with his wife, he usually lives in [**Hospital3 **] with
her, is oriented x3, walks with a walker, and had been
hospitalized very little before the last 3 weeks. He had never
been hospitalized before 3 weeks ago. He is DNR/DNI, but she
would like him to get all of the care necessary to improve his
current status short of intubation.


Past Medical History:
1.) Chronic permanent AF, on warfarin/BB.
2.) Combined systolic/diastolic heart failure
3.) Presumed CAD, s/p inferior MI by imaging.
4.) Vascular dementia.
5.) HTN
6.) Recent urosepsis precipitated by urinary retention s/p
hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **] with Foley catheter in place


Social History:
Retired. Married to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Known lastname 71190**], [**Name Initial (MD) **] retired RN. Children live in
[**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 1474**]. Lives in [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 5087**], but
most recently in rehab. Walks with a walker at baseline.

CXR Portable [**2133-5-14**]:
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are profoundly diminished. The patient
was imaged in
a somewhat lordotic position. There is diffuse interstitial
opacity with
cephalad flow most consistent with volume overload likely due to
congestive heart failure. Aortic tortuosity is present with
calcified plaque seen at the arch. The cardiac silhouette size
is difficult to assess but is enlarged.  There is right pleural
effusion with fluid tracking within the minor and major
fissures. A left pleural effusion cannot be entirely excluded.
There is poor visualization of the retrocardiac lung, possibly
due to atelectasis and/or edema. No pneumothorax is noted. The
bones are diffusely osteopenic with degenerative changes noted
in both shoulder joints.
IMPRESSION: Findings most compatible with congestive heart
failure.
Correlate clinically. Repeat radiography after appropriate
diuresis
recommended to assess for underlying infection.

CT HEAD NON-CONTRAST [**2133-5-16**]:
FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or evidence for
acute vascular territorial infarction is present. There is no
shift of normally midline structures and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation appears well preserved.  There is prominence of
the ventricles and the sulci compatible with parenchymal
atrophy. There are periventricular white matter hypodensities
compatible with small vessel microvascular disease. However, no
acute infarcts are present. Osseous structures appear intact and
the visualized sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. Parenchymal
atrophy and small vessel microvascular disease but no acute
intracranial findings.

SWALLOWING VIDEO FLUOROSCOPY [**2133-5-21**]:
Swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed in conjunction with
the speech and swallow department. Multiple consistencies of
barium were administered.  There was aspiration and penetration
to thin liquids.

ECG, [**2133-5-14**]:
The underlying rhythm is probably atrial fibrillation. Left axis
deviation. Intraventricular conduction defect. One ventricular
premature beat is seen. Lateral ST-T wave changes likely due to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
