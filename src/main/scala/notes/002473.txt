Imaging:
GIB study: Technically inadequate exam due to poor labeling.
This study could be repeated if necessary in 24 hours.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and distal descending
colon. Polyp in the cecum. Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 86yo man with past medical history significant for
recent duodenal bleed s/p exploratory laparotomy with
duodenectomy and oversewn ulcer, s/p polypectomy 2 weeks ago,
presented with lower GI bleed thought secondary to polypectomy,
now s/p cauterization with stable hematocrit.
.
Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:
.
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: He was admitted to the MICU, where he
was thought to have a lower GI bleed. He was transfused two
units PRBCs. A GIB study was technically inadequate. He had a
colonoscopy, which showed diverticulosis of the sigmoid and
distal descending colon, a cecal polyp, and grade 1 internal
hemorrhoids. The cecal polyp was cauterized. He remained
hemodynamically stable and his hematocrits remained stable after
the procedure. He was treated with [**Hospital1 **] protonix.
.
2. Clostridium difficile infection - On [**2-25**], he was noted to
have green diarrhea. This was positive for c. diff. He was
started on a 14 day course of flagyl. By day 10, he was still
having diarrhea and began to spike fevers again. Vancomycin po
was started on [**3-6**]. He was discharged with instructions to
complete a course of PO vancomycin and Flagyl ending on [**2165-3-20**].
.
3. Hypertension - Lopressor was held secondary to GI bleed, then
restarted once he was stable with good blood pressure control,
and converted to Toprol XL prior to discharge.
.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - The patient was
maintained on albuterol prn.
.
5. Depression - Seroquel was changed to Celexa during
hospitalization.
.
6. Nutrition - He had a speech and swallow evaluation, and was
continued on aspiration precautions. He needed observation for
meals. Medications were crushed in applesauce. He had a kosher
ground diet, with nectar thickened liquids. Tube feeds at the
time of discharge were Promote w/ fiber Full strength. He was
also started on ascorbic acid and zinc sulfate supplements to be
taken for 2 weeks, per nutrition recs.
.
7. Left thumb swelling - During the hospitalization, he was
noted to have left thumb swelling. He had no evidence of trauma,
and had no clear history of thumb swelling previously. He was
treated with a short course of colchicine, rest, elevation.
NSAIDs were not given due to his GI bleed. The rheumatology
service was consulted, who felt that he had no clear indication
of any inflammatory crystal disease, and that the thumb was not
amenable to tap. An x-ray showed no evidence of fracture. It may
have been secondary to unwitnessed minor trauma. It resolved
with conservative management during hospitalization.
