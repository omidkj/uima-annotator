Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2146-6-10**]-left thoracotomy with placement of epicardial BiV lead


History of Present Illness:
68 yo F w/ Class III systolic HF with EF of [**10-17**]% s/p BiV-ICD
placement, severe asthma and back pain who presents from the
holding area of the cath lab with dyspnea/tachypnea prior to
exchange of LV lead. Pt had recent admission for polymorphine VT
with her ICD discharging 5 times and she was found to have
malpositioned anterior LV lead. After she was stabilized and
breathing had improved she was discharged on [**6-2**] with plan to
come back in for scheduled outpatient LV lead exchange which was
today. Her weight at the time of discharge was 160lbs. Pt
reports she felt fine when leaving on [**6-2**] but quickly started
to all of a sudden feel "worse". Pt reports feeling sick from
then until now. She describes it as feeling fatigued, with
worsened breathing, and nausea. Her weight was decreasing while
at home and she was 156 at home on the day of admission. She
reported worsening breathing, with a coughing fit the day prior.
She denies any fevers or chills or sick contacts. She was
recently treated for a pneumonia on her previous admission. She
denies any dietary indiscretions or problems with the milrinone
pump. Her VNA reported that she heard crackles the day prior to
admission.
Of note at the time of discharge the following changes were made
to her regimen (stopped digoxin, stopped valsartan, stopped
gabapentin, decreased metoprolol from 75mg to 50mg, increased
torsemide prn from 40 to 50mg,decreased sertraline from
200-->100), and the patient reports not problems with physically
making these changes.
In the holding area to the cath lab the patient was noted to be
acute tachypnic to the 40s with crackles in the lungs
posteriorly with JVP elevated to the mandible. She received 80IV
Lasix x1 and placed a foley. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] evaluated the patient in
the hodling area and felt she required further evaluation and
management with lasix drip and milrinone drip
On arrival to CCU she reports feeling 100% better. She continues
to feel a little nauseus and denies any chest pain or
palpitations. She is feeling overwhelmed with her illness and
her multiple hospitalizations recently. And complaining of back
pain.
On review of systems, she reports improved swelling in her legs
bilaterally, no abdominal pain, last moved her bowels the day
prior to admission, no hematuria or dysuria. She reports her
mood is stable compared to prior to the change in her
medications. She reports she cannot sleep flat because of back
pain and problems getting comfortable.

IMAGING:
CT Venography of Coronary Veins [**2146-6-8**]: The only mapped coronary
vein visualized was seen along the inferior septum/inferior wall
aspect of left ventricle, along the posterior descending
coronary artery, most probably a middle cardiac vein.   The left
ventricular pacing lead is seen coursing into the coronary sinus
and then into the great cardiac vein. Focal stenosis at the
origin of the celiac artery is causing approximately 40%
narrowing. In addition, there is  stenosis in the superior
mesenteric artery just beyond its origin, which is incompletely
imaged.For other findings on the heart and thorax, please refer
to CT dated [**2146-6-1**].

CXR [**2146-6-7**]: 1.  Right upper extremity picc unchanged in location
in the lower svc. 2.  Interval increase in pulmonary vascular
engorgement and mild interstitial edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly
is unchanged.

ECHO [**2146-6-10**]: PRE LEAD PLACEMENT: Perioperative exam performed to
monitor hemodynamics and assess ventricular resynchronization
therapy. Severely depressed LV systolic function with LVEF < 15%
with global HK and severely dilated LV. The left atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter with mild
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal, but restricted leaflet motion is seen. The
mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Intact IAS. No clot in LAA. Normal coronary sinus. Severe
diastolic dysfunction with e' = 5 cm/sec.
