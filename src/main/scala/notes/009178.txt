noted to have blood tinged pulmonary secretions. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as there were no ICU beds available at

EKG. [**2133-4-16**]. NSR at 99 bpm, normal axis, normal PR, qrs, qtc
interval. TWI in I, R, L. J point elevation in V1-V4. Q waves in
II, III, F, V1-V5.
.
Echo.[**2133-4-16**].
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. LV ejection fraction appears moderately-to-severely
depressed (30 percent) secomndary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis
of the interventricular septum, anterior wall, and apex. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: extensive anterior, septal, apical myocardial
infarct.

Renal ultrasound [**2133-4-17**]:
IMPRESSION: extensive anterior, septal, apical myocardial
infarct
.
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Delayed upstroke in the main renal artery, Doppler signal and
low-
resistive indices are concerning for renal artery stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 63 yo female with CAD s/p MI, COPD, s/p extubation for
flash pulmonary edema with resolved acute on chronic renal
failure. Transferred from unit to floor after extubation for
sCHF management.

# sCHF EF 30%- Patient had previous LAD large MI with wall
motion abnormality. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 16351**]. No ACEI since RAS in the only
renal artery. on BB, holding Lasix since there was acute renal
failure. Uptirtrating coreg. Imdur 60mg PO daily.

# Resolved respiratory failure // COPD- Patient presents with
acute onset of SOB with no clear prodrome symptoms per her
husband. Likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema given rapid
resolution of CXR and that symptoms occured in setting of HTN.
Given history of MI, concern for acute MI as well; patient
completed ROMI. Given lack of significant wbc or left shift or
fever, pneumonia unlikely. COPD does not seem to be etiology
given that it was acute in onset. Malignancy history raises the
possibility of PE, though currently no longer tachycardic and
hypoxia. Continue prednisone 10 mg, Advair continued, received
nebs while in house. Patient was satting 95% on RA at the time
of discharge. Smoking cessation was encouraged and patient said
that she would quit and patient was given a prescription for
nicotine patch.

# Resolved acute renal failure, Stage 3 chronic renal failure -
Only has one kidney. Patient is s/p renal transplant. Cr rose
from 1 to 1.4 over 8 hours without episode of hypotension, in
setting of lasix diuresis.

# RAS - By doppler study.  No intervention can be performed
until the patient quits smoking.

# s/p renal transplant - Patient was seen by transplant
nephrology. Continue prednisone 10 mg and azathioprine.

# Completed ROMI - troponin trending down, demand in setting
hypertensive emergency and chronic renal failure

# CAD s/p MI. H/o anteroseptal MI. Continue aspirin, statin,
coreg

# Diabetes. On glipizide at home. RISS  while in house.
