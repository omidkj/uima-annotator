HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 22559**] is a
67-year-old female with a history of severe mitral
regurgitation, who recently underwent mitral valve
replacement two weeks prior to admission, complicated only by
a brief episode of postoperative bradycardia.  The patient
for a visit on the day of admission due to worsening
shortness of breath, cough, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
with orthopnea since she went home.  She was sent to the
Emergency department from [**Hospital **] Clinic via ambulance.

On further questioning through the translator, the patient
reported that she was feeling ill on her day of discharge,
discharge she had developed worsening cough, producing white
phlegm and occasional blood-tinged sputum, but never yellow
or green.  She reported that she had not been able to sleep,
and she has not been able to lie flat, and she has been
sitting in a chair at night.  She denied any fever, chills,
or any chest pain.  She denied any nausea or vomiting, but
she had one episode of frequent loose stools.  She denied any
melena or hematochezia.  She denied any palpitations.

In the emergency department, the patient was found to have
bibasilar crackles and an elevated jugular vein at
10  cm to 12 cm.  A portable chest x-ray result was reported
to show congestive heart failure and right sided pleural
effusion.  The patient was given 40 mg IV Lasix with good
output.  The patient was given Levofloxacin for questionable
UTI by urine dipstick.  Blood cultures were not obtained.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3.

3.  Hypertension.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  History of dental abscess.

9.  Coumadin 1 mg p.o.q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked in the past, no alcohol
history.  She lives with her sister.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Heart rate 96 and irregular, blood pressure 124/70,
respiratory rate 22, oxygen saturation 99% on three liters
nasal cannula.  GENERAL:  The patient is an alert, awake
female looking slightly tremulous and short of breath upon
speaking.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, throat:  Examination
demonstrated mucous membranes mildly dry, no icterus.
Conjunctiva, pallor found.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 metalic, soft
1/6 systolic murmur, irregular rhythm.
PULMONARY:  Right decreased air entry in the lower chest,
crackles and rubs in mid chest left basilar crackles, no
wheezing, postoperative wound well approximated, no apparent
drainage, no pain over the chest wound.  ABDOMEN:
Nondistended, nontender, positive bowel sounds, no mass,
right flank changes with local skin breakdown extending into
the right hip, back, and buttock regions.  Possible resolving
hematoma.  RECTAL:  Rectal examination revealed no
obstipation, guaiac-negative stool.  EXTREMITIES:  No lower
extremity edema.  No calf tenderness.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The
patient is alert, awake, oriented times three; appears to
answer appropriately to questions, moving all four
extremities, asymmetric.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs upon admission revealed the following:
White count 18.2, hematocrit 27.8, platelet count 781,000, PT
21.6, PTT 39.5, INR 3.2.  Sodium 128, potassium 5.3, chloride
92, bicarbonate 25, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8, glucose 165, CK
222, troponin less than 0.3.  Urinalysis showed 3 to 5 white
cells plus nitrites.  Catheterization results on [**2193-2-26**] revealed the coronary arteries normal,
moderate-to-several mitral regurgitation plus severe mitral
annular calcification and normal ventricular function with a
EF of 64%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was maintained on telemetry and
[**Hospital Unit Name **] service.  By ECHO, she was subsequently found to have an
approximately 500 cc pericardial effusion, which was drained
percutaneously without any complications.  Coumadin was held
prior to procedure and ordered to decrease the INR to less
than two.  Also, after the patient's pericardiocentesis she was
cardioverted secondary to her atrial fibrillation; it was
successful.  The patient was maintained in normal sinus
rhythm throughout the course of her stay.

RESPIRATORY:  The patient also was found to have a right phrenic
nerve paresis, likely temporary as the nerve was not
transected, apparently irritated during the mitral valve
replacement procedure.  She was found to have a left-sided
pleural effusion, which was successfully drained by the
pulmonary fellow.  Fluid was sent off for analysis and no
infection or malignancy was found.

The patient's symptoms improved.  She has a baseline
shortness of breath when she lies down, however, she had no
worsening of shortness of breath, cough, or chest pain
throughout the course of stay.

HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was restarted on her Coumadin with a
Coumadin load secondary to her atrial fibrillation history,
as well as prosthetic valve.  It was considered crucial that
her INR is at least 2.5 before she is discharged.  She was to
follow-up with the [**Hospital 197**] Clinic.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Mitral valve replacement.
2.  Pericardial effusion, status post pericardiocentesis.
3.  Left pleural effusion status post right thoracocentesis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.q.d. until [**2193-4-29**] and
then 200 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o.q.h.s.
3.  Mavik 4 mg p.o.q.d.
4.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.h.s.
5.  Iron sulfate 325 mg p.o.q.d.
6.  Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d.
7.  Captopril 6.25 p.o.t.i.d.
8.  Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o.t.i.d.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to followup with her
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**5-1**] at 2:30.  She
is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], her cardiologist on
[**5-2**], 4:15 and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**], her CT surgeon [**4-30**] at
