CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: pt with left hilar mass on CXR; please evaluate for
pericard
Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old man with hx of COPD, tobacco abuse who presents with
left chest pain, shortness of breath, hypotension
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pt with left hilar mass on CXR; please evaluate for pericardial
involement as etiology of hypotension
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: ARF

PROCEDURE: Chest CT without contrast.

HISTORY: 61-year-old man with history of COPD, tobacco abuse who
presents with left chest pain, shortness of breath and
hypertension, please evaluate for pericardial involvement as
etiology of hypertension.

There are no prior cross-sectional studies available for
comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images throughout the chest without
contrast.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Important emphysematous
changes are seen throughout both lungs with some small areas of
scarring in both upper lungs. There is diffuse consolidation
opacity throughout the medial and posterior basal segments of
the left lower lobe associated with small left pleural effusion
consistent with diffuse pneumonia. There is no evidence to
suggest focal mass. The heart, pericardium and great vessels are
unremarkable. There are no pathologically enlarged axillary or
mediastinal lymph nodes. The airways are patent.

Very limited axial imaging throughout the upper abdomen
demonstrates no abnormalities.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no concerning bone lesions. Mild
degenerative changes are seen throughout the spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left basal pneumonia with small quantity of left pleural
effusion.
2. Important emphysematous changes throughout the rest of the
pulmonary parenchyma


[**2181-2-10**] Echocardiagram

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Resting
tachycardia (HR>100bpm). Emergency study performed by the
cardiology fellow on  call.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal.  Views are technically suboptimal for assessment
of systolic function (grossly  preserved). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion  abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The right ventricle may be dilated. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 YO with history of COPD, HTN, p/w LLL PNA and left sided pain


LLL PNA- He was admitted with shortness of breath and productive
cough. He initially was being treated with telithromycin but
noted no improvement. The patient on admission showed
progression of pneumonia on his admission xray. He was started
on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  Ultimately his sputum culture
grew out MRSA and he was started on vancomycin.  Blood cultures
were taken and were all negative at time of discharge.  The
following day after admission, he developed hypotension and
associated shortness of breath. He had increasing oxygen
requirements and was transferred to the unit.  There was no
indications of pericardial tamponade or pulmonary embolism noted
on his ABG or ekg.  He blood pressure was stabilized in the
unit, and he was transferred back to the floor where, he treated
solely with vancomycin and nebulizers with good improvement in
his respiratory status with decreasing oxygen requirements and
he was weaned to room air.  He was discharged with a total 14
day course of antibiotics, he was discharged with linezolid.

Leukocytosis- This was likely associated with his pneumonia and
returned to baseline limits at time of discharge.

ARF:  This was likely prerenal as with hydration it returned to
a baseline 0.9.  Although his FeNA was 1.26 not suggestive of a
prerenal acute renal failure.

Hypotension: On the floor, pt's initial BP was 100/70 with a HR
of 116. Over the next few hours, his BP dropped to 80s/40s with
an increase in his heart rate to the 130s. An EKG showed sinus
tach with low voltage. He was given 2.5L of NS and BP response
was poor. It remained in the 70s-80s for the next several hours
and pt was transferred to the ICU for further care. In CCU, SBP
110, given 3L IVF (total 4-5 L during MICU stay.) There was no
demonstration of pericardial tamponade on echocardiagram and
after his blood pressure was stabilized he was returned to the
floor with no more episodes of hypotension.

COPD-  He was continued on his outpatient regiemtn of flovent,
albuterol and spiriva.
