No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
SBO with ischemic bowel

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**6-24**]: Exploratory laparotomy with lysis of
adhesions, resection of small bowel, and temporary closure of
abdomen.
[**6-27**]: Small-bowel resection with primary anastomosis
and abdominal closure.


History of Present Illness:
83M presented to his PCP's office on the morning of [**6-24**]
complaining
of one day of worsening abdominal pain and a firm abdomen.  He
was sent to the ED where he was noted to be of altered mental
status (AAOx1), had a lactate of 8.3 and was increasingly
tachypneic prompting intubation.  At time of this exam, he is
intubated, sedated and on norepinephrine to support his blood
pressure.

Per his wife, he was doing pretty well up until this morning
except for mild complaints of abdominal pain the last day.  No
fevers or chills, nausea or vomiting at home.

Past Medical History:
PMH: GERD, HTN, HLD, rectal/colon ca s/p resection, mitral
insufficiency, mild aortic stenosis, right inguinal hernia

PSH: colonic resection (for colon/rectal CA) via lower midline
laparotomy [**2169**], TURP [**2191**]


Social History:
Lives with wife (accompanying him today), 2 children
(daughter lives locally, son in [**Name (NI) **])


Family History:
No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or
sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.

PERTINENT REPORTS:
TTE [**2200-6-24**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Tricuspid annular plane
systolic excursion is depressed (12 mm) consistent with right
ventricular systolic dysfunction. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric, anteriorly-directed jet of Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricle. Moderate aortic
stenosis with estimated valve area of 1.1 cm2. Depressed right
ventricular systolic function. Prolapsed posterior mitral valve
leaflet.

CT Torso with Contrast [**2200-6-24**]
Closed loop obstruction in the right lower quadrant with
hypoenhancing loops of bowel and free fluid throughout the
abdomen and pelvis, concerning for bowel ischemia.

CT Head [**2200-6-24**]
1.  No acute intracranial process.
2.  Chronic left maxillary sinus mucosal disease.

TEE [**2200-6-25**]
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The abdominal aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the abdominal
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is severe posterior leaflet mitral
valve prolapse. There is at least moderate and probably severe
mitral regurgitation(3+ to 4+) . Due to the eccentric nature of
the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

CT Torso [**2200-7-4**]
1.  No evidence of an anastomotic leak.
2.  Thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectal wall suggestive
for
proctitis/colitis.
3.  Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
4.  2.5 x 1.9 cm hypodense hepatic lesion at the junction of
segment II and [**Doctor First Name 690**] is incompletely characterized and requires an
ultrasound or MRI for further characterization.

TTE [**2200-7-9**]
Focused, limited views due to the patient's inability to
cooperate:
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Aortic regurgitation is
present, but cannot be quantified. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate/severe posterior leaflet
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the prior, complete study dated [**2200-6-24**] (images
reviewed), based on transvalvular gradients and velocity only
([**Location (un) 109**] cannot be calculated currently as a parasternal long axis
view is not available for reliable LVOT measurement), the degree
of aortic stenosis is moderate and possibly underestimated given
limited echocardiographic views.
