Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted in respiratory distress with tachypnea
and high Peak pressures. This was thought to be due to anxiety
with subequent tachpnea followed by increased intrathoracic
pressure and tracheal collapse which then creates a cycle of
anxiety and further respiratory distress. Her PEEP was increased
to 20 help stent open her trachea, with immediate relief,
resolution of tachpnea and decrease in peak pressures. She was
also given ativan and fentanyl. Over the course of her
hospitalization, her PEEP was weaned down to 10, which is where
it was at the time of discharge. Her anxiety was treated by
increasing alprazolam to [**Hospital1 **] and low dose ativan PRN for
dyspnea.

She will need follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 18**], interventional
pulmonary, at 6-8 weeks for further evaluation and possible
restenting of trachea.

After several days, her sputum finally grew orpharyngeal flora
and acinetobacter, for which she needs a 14 day course of
bactrim ending on [**2149-6-3**]. It is unclear if this is a true
PNA w/o change on CXR, no fever but she may have a
tracheobronchitis.  She was also found to have an Ecoli UTI that
is sensitive to Bactrim as well. Her foley catheter was changed
and repeat UA was negative.

She also was found to be C.diff positive on stool sample and she
was started on Flagyl to complete a 21 day course (14 days plus
one week past bactrim). Given that she will be on Bactrim for 2
weeks, she will need a CBC, K, renal function checked weekly for
those two weeks.
