diffuse SAH. She was loaded with Dilantin, started on Nimodine
and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].

anterior wall MI, chest pain with recent echocardiagram and

disease

Pertinent Results:
[**2197-8-8**] 12:35PM   PT-11.7 PTT-27.7 INR(PT)-1.1
[**2197-8-8**] 12:35PM   PLT COUNT-232

CT head [**2197-8-8**]: Interval increase in the degree of intracranial
subarachnoid and intraventricular blood, as well as new,
hyperdense material immediately adjacent to a coiled anterior
communicating artery aneurysm.  This latter raises concern for a
small amount of extravascular leakage of intravenous contrast.

CXR [**2197-8-8**]:  Adequate position of the ET tube on the third
image of the
series.  NG tube positioned appropriately.  Rounded opacity in
the right upper lung which is concerning for mass lesion versus
infection/aspiration.  Followup to resolution is advised

CT Head [**8-9**]: IMPRESSION:
1.  Unchanged distribution of the diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrhage, with
interval resorption/redistribution of the intraventricular
hemorrhage, and no new hemorrhage.
2.  No findings suggestive of acute territorial infarction.
3.  No change in the shape and size of the lateral ventricles to
suggest
obstructive hydrocephalus, and overall unchanged position of the
ventricular drain.

[**8-9**] CXR:
ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube ends in the
upper stomach.  Previous large opacity in the right upper lung
zone is much smaller and less radiodense.  The rapid
disappearance suggests this was focal pulmonary hemorrhage, less
likely pneumonia given substantial involution in only 24 hours.
Left lung is grossly clear.  Heart size is normal.

[**8-9**] Angio: IMPRESSION:  [**Known firstname 14880**] [**Known lastname 14879**] underwent cerebral
angiography demonstrating persistent large, approximately 6 x 5
mm wide neck anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  A
previously placed coil was found unchanged and in appropriate
position.  The anterior communicating artery aneurysm was
successfully coiled with an additional five Target 360
detachable coils.

[**8-11**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF = 35 %) secondary to
extensive apical hypokinesis with focal akinesis, severe
hypokinesis of the anterior free wall, and hypokinesis of the
inferior free wall. The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Overall right
ventricular function appears preserved. However, there is focal
dyskinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve is not well
seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: extensive, segmental wall motion abnormalities of
the left ventricle are present

[**8-11**] CXR:
CONCLUSION:
1.  Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.  Small bilateral
pleural effusion
has also increased.
2.  Bibasilar opacities are probably compatible with dependent
edema.
Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in
appropriate
clinical settings.

[**8-13**] CTA Brain:
IMPRESSION:  1. Status post anterior communicating artery
aneurysm
embolization with coils, grossly there is no evidence of
residual aneurysm; however, the examination is limited due to
streak artifact from coil material. The major vascular
structures are patent with no evidence of vasospasm.

2.  The distribution and amount of blood in the subarachnoid
space has been decreased, likely related with reabsorption and
redistribution, there is persistent intraventricular hemorrhage.
 Unchanged right frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, there is no evidence of
hydrocephalus, unchanged right frontal ventricular shunt via
right frontal burr hole, terminating at the level of the foramen
of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] on the right.

3.  Mucosal thickening with air-fluid level noted in the left
maxillary sinus and patchy ethmoidal and frontoethmoidal mucosal
thickening as described above.
