History of Present Illness:
70M with hyperlipidemia and DM1 transferred from [**Hospital **] Hosp
where he presented in DKA/hyperglycemia and a new right subdural
hematoma. Patient reports that he was in his USOH until Mon [**4-27**]
when he "felt sick, cold with chills." He was thirsty and
wanting to drink water all the time but not urinating much. He
then had difficulty with balance and had multiple falls
including falling off a treadmill without hitting his head, LOC

IMAGING:
CT C-SPINE without CONTRAST-
1.  Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C7 on T1. Flex/extension views
are recommended for further evaluation, if there are symptoms
referable to this region.
2.  Degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
.
HEAD CT [**4-29**]-
1.  Moderate-sized right-sided subdural hematoma.
2.  Left-sided chronic subdural hematoma.
.
EKG- [**4-29**]
Probable ectopic atrial rhythm, although consider also,
accelerated junctional rhythm. Left bundle-branch block with
ST-T wave abnormalities. The ST-T wave changes are diffuse.
Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available
for comparison.
  Intervals Axes
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
76 62 126 430/460.14 -156 33 171
.
HEAD CT [**4-30**]-
Stable appearance of the brain and subdural hematomas, compared
to the previous study of [**2178-4-29**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9526**] was
informed of these findings at 9:52 a.m. on [**2178-4-30**].
.
C-SPINE FLEX/EX- Degenerative changes of the lower cervical
spine without signs for ligamentous laxity on flexion or
extension views of the upper cervical spine.  Please note that
the C7-T1 junction is not imaged.
.
CXR PA/LAT- Right lower lobe pneumonia.
.
EKG [**4-30**]-
Probable ectopic atrial rhythm, although consider also
accelerated junctional rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy with
ST-T wave abnormalities. The ST-T wave changes are diffuse.
Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of
[**2178-4-29**] no significant change.

.
Cervical MRI: No evidence of ligamentous disruption seen. No
evidence of abnormal signal seen within the vertebral bodies to
indicate acute trauma. Multilevel degenerative changes with
foraminal changes as above. No evidence of extrinsic spinal cord
compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
.
KUB: Stable appearance to the dilated loops of small and large
bowel as compared to one day prior.
.
Abd US: There is no fluid collection within the subcutaneous
tissues of the right hemi-abdomen, flank, or right back. No
fluid is seen within the peritoneal cavity along the right side.
No hematomas.


Brief Hospital Course:
Breifly, 70M with hyperlipidemia and diabetes [**Hospital **]
transferred from [**Hospital **] Hosp where he presented in
DKA/hyperglycemia and a new right subdural hematoma.
.
#. Fevers- Downtrending from 102-103 to 100.1. Negative
infectious w/u thought to be associated with SDH/R flank
hematoma or dilantin. Known RLL pneumonia treated 5 days with
ceftriaxone/azithro and 6days IV flagyl w/resolution on CXR. KUB
suggested ileus however passing gas and no nausea/vomitting per
pt. UA neg. OSH abd CT [**4-29**] negative for abscess. Abd US no
ductal dilatation or abscess. Titrating off dilantin and started
keppra ([**5-9**]) which will be continued until neurosurgery
outpatient follow-up; overlap two days then titrate down
dilantin 100mg qd.
.
#. Elevated INR- received FFP and vit K for INR 1.9 [**5-8**].
Neurosurg re-consulted, exam unchanged. Likely [**1-22**] to poor
nutrition given NPO for past few days [**1-22**] ileus. Kept INR<1.5,
vitK and FFP PRN and serial neuro exams.
.
#. Ileus- serial KUB with adynamic ileus. No nausea/vomitting,
+gas, has had chronic decreased appetite, no abdominal
tenderness. s/p NGT to suction. Repeat KUB [**5-7**] "stable". Since
clinically improved d/c'd NGT [**5-7**] and tolerating clears ->
ADAT. Patient tolerating regular diet. Monitored abd exam
closely and adhered to strict bowel regimen.
.
#. Right lower lobe pneumonia- as above
.
#. DKA/DM1- Gap closed with insulin gtt in MICU. Unclear cause
of hyperglycemia possibly poor med compliance versus infection
given leukocytosis upon presentation at OSH. PCP faxed over his
med records, supposedly was on avandia, metformin, lipitor and
lisinopril. Now insulin dependent diabetic and [**Last Name (un) **] consulted.
A1C 11.2. Continued titrating up lantus 22U qhs as appetite
improved and
