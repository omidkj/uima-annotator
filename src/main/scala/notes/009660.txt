Conclusions
Prebypass

The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is moderate to severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesia of the apex and
severe hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of the
inferior, inferolateral and inferoseptal walls. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] with
mild global RV free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4901**] on [**2118-10-11**] at 1100am.

Post bypass

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine,
epinephrine and milrinone. LVEF slightly improved. LVEF= 40 %

Annuloplasty ring seen in the mitral postion. It appears well
seated and there is trivial mitral regurgitation. The mean
gradient across the mitral valve is 2 mm Hg. Aorta is intact
post decannulation. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] informed of post bypass results.

  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
