Codeine / Latex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
70 year old female with known pulmonary fibrosis, cervical
cancer 25 years prior, seizure disorder presenting from outside
hospital with concern for dyspnea and hypoxia. Of note, the
patient is on 6 L of oxygen at baseline. She has had 7 days of
gradually increasing shortness of breath, exacerbated by today,
relieved partially with spironolactone and increased oxygen
utilization. Patient was started on CellCept about a month ago
as a measure to try to improve her IPF. She endorses a 21 pound
unintentional weight gain over the past week. She also endorses
some headaches, abdominal pain, which she attributes to the
CellCept. She also says her weight gain correlates with the time
that she started her CellCept; her predominate complaint on
presentation today was mostly her weight gain and fluid
overload.

In the ED, initial VS were 97 68 148/98 24 98% nrb. Labs were
performed which were ntoable for a lactate of 1.9, a U/A with
leuks, WBC, and bacteria, tropinin negative x 1, proBNP 3976,
and INR: 1.2. In the ED she was given written for Nitropaste
0.5in TP Q6H, as well as CeftriaXONE 1g. A CXR was performed
which on my read appeared diffuse to show pulmonary edema. EKG
in the ED showed Twave flatting in V4-V6 as compared to [**2195-2-9**].
On transfer, her vitals were 97.5 88 25 146/89 100% BiPAP.
Notably, at OSH she was given 60 mg IV Lasix and put out ~3 L.
She has made 1 L since arrival to our ED.
.
She has been diagnosed with IPF. A rheumatologic panel as well
as a hypersensitivity panel and a careful history did not detail
any obvious etiology for her pulmonary fibrosis and therefore it
was felt that she may have had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
although the upper lobe predominance of her infiltrates is not
classic. An ECHO done [**2195-10-8**] showed an [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 15695**], normal
LVEF, and normal PASP. She also had a right heart
catheterization performed which showed PCWP 14, and a PA 40/16,
read as mild pulmonary hypertenstion on  [**2195-2-9**] with
elevation of PVR, normal filling pressures and preserved cardiac
output. A CT scan of the chest on that day, which was notable
for subpleural reticular markings that were increased as  well
as areas of honeycombing consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Her
case of IPF had previously been discussed at case conferences,
and given the extensive fibrosis and lack of ground glass or
other abnormalities the consensus was that she was unlikely to
respond to cytotoxic therapy such as azathioprine, cellcept. She
was initiated on Letairis around [**2195-3-16**]. An attempted to
refer her for a lung transplantation evaluation did not procede
forward given her prohibitive BMI of 38. She had self DC'ed her
Letairis in 5/[**2195**].  She is on 6 liters O2 with exertion and has
become quite sedentary.
.
A letter from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-1**] indicated that she had
recently started CellCept, in addition to having been recently
treated for a UTI with Bactrim/Doxycycline.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is on BiPaP, but is very pleasant,
alert, and oriented.

never used marijuana, cocaine or heroin.  She has never been
exposed to asbestos that she knows of.  She has lived in the
Northeast her entire life.  She does have a dog at home but no
birds.  She has not had any recent farm animal exposure,
although she did live on a farm when she was younger.

Family History:
Mother with "arthritis" which does not require treatment.  She
does have a brother with lung cancer diagnosed at the age of 68.
 He was a heavy smoker.  In addition, she also has another
brother age 59 with emphysema.  He also was a smoker.

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2197-3-18**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Borderline left ventricular systolic function with
abnormal systolic septal motion consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. Moderately dilated right
ventricle with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. Severe
pulmonary hypertension. Mildly dilated aortic arch. Moderate
tricuspid valve regurgitation. Compared with the findings of the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-10-8**], there is now severe
pulmonary hypertension, moderate dilation and moderate
dysfunction of the right ventricle, moderate tricuspid
regurgitation, and borderline left ventricular systolic
function.

CXR [**2197-3-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Probable moderate interstitial pulmonary edema
superimposed upon background pulmonary fibrosis. The ddx could
include fibrosis with superimposed interstital pneumonia, though
this is considered less likely.
