History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 yo male with a history of CLL,
hypogammaglobulinemia, parkinson's disease, and recurrent PNA
who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-14**] with cough and fever, now
transferred to the MICU due to tachypnea.  He presented with
fever, cough, and fatigue in the setting of undergoing bowel
prep for colonoscopy (for workup of chronic diarrhea).  Of note
he had a recent MRSA PNA and Pseudomonas sinus infection (as
well a thrush and intertiginous [**Female First Name (un) 564**]) and had been on vanc
and cefepime.  CXR in the ED was concerning for an opacity.  He
was cultured and started on vanc, cefepime, and IVF for possible
PNA.
.
On the floor he was continued on vanc and cefepime (since [**1-14**]).
She was started on oseltamivir on [**1-14**] on the floor due to
concern for flu (he was uptodate with his flu shot).   He has
had some issues with a.fib with RVR during this hospitalization
and his home metoprolol was changed to diltiazem and uptitrated.
 Azithromycin was started on [**1-16**] due to concern for atypical
PNA.  ID was consulted and recommended starting gentamicin if he
worsened (which was started early [**1-18**] prior to transfer).  IVIG
was recommended, but not given due to concern for administration
during fevers.
.
The afternoon and evening prior to transfer he was noted to be
tahypneic to the 30's on a high flow shovel mask.  An ABG was
7.49/34/63 on 3.5 L.  He was using an acapella valve to help
clear secretions.  Nightfloat was called to see him due to
worsening tachypnea in the 40's and initiated transfer to the
MICU.
.
Currently he denies pain.  He feels like his breathing is
getting worse and he is tired.
.
On ROS he admits to loose bowel movements.  ROS was limited due
to respiratory distress.

Imaging:
[**1-15**] ECG: Baseline artifact. The rhythm is likely atrial
flutter/coarse atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2106-10-13**] the findings are similar.
[**1-17**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right
upper lobe opacity is not relevantly changed. The left lower
lobe opacity is slightly more extensive than on the previous
examination and is today accompanied by a small left pleural
effusion. No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal
opacities. Unchanged calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe.
Unchanged heart size, unchanged mild tortuosity of the thoracic
aorta.
[**1-20**] LENIs: No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
.
Cytology:
[**1-18**] Bronchial washings: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

Brief Hospital Course:
Initial differential for his tachypnea and hypoxia included
worsening PNA, PE, or acute CHF.  Patient was intubated
emergently on arrival to MICU for respiratory distress.
Microbiology studies were as above; sputum grew pseudomonas and
aspergillus. ID was consulted for antimicrobial management; the
patient was treated with vancomycin, meropenem, and
voriconazole. His respiratory status continued to worsen, and he
required increasing levels of ventilatory support. IP was
consulted for possible u/s guided thoracentesis of left pleural
effusion but were unable to locate a big enough pocket of fluid.

Blood pressures were initially stable but the patient eventually
developed likely septic shock, and became vasopressor dependent.
He was not given his rate control agents for atrial
fibrillation, given his hypotension. His renal function worsened
acutely the day after transfer to the MICU, and BUN/creatinine
continued to worsen through the rest of his hospitalization.

His CLL was evident with leukocytosis beyond his baseline WBC
levels. His hypogammaglobulinemia was demonstrated with low IgG,
IgM, and IgA levels. IVIG was considered, but ultimately not
given in his state of acute critical illness and fevers. He was
also continued on his chronic Parkinson's medications.

The patient's family had been kept aware of his worsening
condition. On [**1-22**], after further discussions with the family,
the decision was made to transition the patient's care to
comfort measures only. His vasopressors were stopped, and he
passed away with his family at his side, several hours
thereafter.
