Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea and melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
81 yo M  w/ h/o bladder ca s/p surgery and L nephrectomy, lung
tumor s/p resection, CHF (EF 20%), CAD s/p multiple stents, BPH
who initially presented to OSH for dyspnea and melena, found to
hct 21 and troponin I elevation transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for
managment of GIB and demand ischemia.
.
Per patient, he initially presented to OSH for dyspnea on
exertion and black stools for several days.  He denies abdominal
pain or hematemesis.
.
On admission to the OSH, his labs were notable for: hct of 21,
plts 112, trop I of <0.06, Cr 1.1, nl LFTs, BNP 216, INR 1.5.
His dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial: anemia, CHF.  His
hct trend was: 21 ([**9-27**])-> 25 ([**9-28**]) -> 29 ([**9-29**]).  Per
discharge summary patient received 6-7 units of pRBC throughout
his stay, he received 5 units on [**9-29**] and 2 units prior to
transfer on [**9-30**].  GI consulted and thought UGIB likely.  He
was started on a ppi ggt and planned for possible endoscopy.
His hospital course was further complicated by troponin I leak
to 25.  His ECG showed q's inferiorly and precordial chest
leads, and patient was not complaining of chest pain.  He
developed episodes of hypotension that improved w/ holding coreg
and reducing imdur from 60 to 30 and blood transfusions.  He had
a CTA was neg for PE.  He was seen by cards, who suggested to
d/c plavix, but continue aspirin.  His troponin elevated due to
acute event vs demand ischemia and ultimately he was not scoped.
 He also developed urinary retention and cr elevated from 1.1 on
admission to 1.4.  Urology was consulted.  A renal US did not
show hydronephrosis.  His retention was thought to be secondary
to BPH and a foley was placed.
.
Currently, he denies chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting.  He states his dyspnea has improved.
.
Of note, patient states that he had an episode of BRBPR a few
years ago.  His [**Month/Year (2) 802**] states that this was secondary to
diverticulosis.  He may have had a colonoscopy within this time
period, but they are uncertain.

PERTINENT STUDIES
TTE [**2175-9-30**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis and
thinning/aneurysm of the basal inferolateral and inferior wall.
There is hypokinesis of the mid-inferolateral and distal lateral
wall and the true apex. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 35 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening
of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD as detailed above. Moderate left ventricular
hypertrophy and cavity dilation. Severe aortic stenosis. Severe
pulmonary hypertension. Moderate tricuspid and mitral
regurgitation. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.
.
CXR [**2175-9-29**]:
Heart size is enlarged, in particular left ventricle.
Mediastinum is
relatively wide although it might be explained by the portable
study
character. Multifocal linear densities projecting over the lungs
most likely represent calcified pleural plaques. No appreciable
pulmonary edema is seen.
The evaluation is limited due to the presence of pulmonary
nodules given superimposed pleural plaques and if clinically
warranted, correlation with chest CT might be considered
.
EGD [**2175-10-1**]:
Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Normal mucosa in the stomach
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Follow up per inpatient GI team recommendations

The findings do not account for the symptoms, patient should
undergo elective colonoscopy while inpatient within the next few
days. He will need MAC anesthesia for this as well.
.
Colonoscopy [**2175-10-3**]: Multiple diverticula were seen in the
sigmoid. Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: No cause of GI bleeding found.
.
CT abdomen and pelvis: [**2175-10-3**] 1. No CT evidence for active
gastrointestinal bleeding or aortoenteric fistula.
2. Small pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusions
.
CXR [**2175-10-4**]: In comparison with the study of [**9-29**], there is
continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with left
ventricular prominence. It is difficult to assess the widening
of the mediastinum due to obliquity of the patient.
Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated
pulmonary venous pressure. Retrocardiac opacification is
consistent with some volume loss in the left lower lobe. Pleural
plaques and some nodularity again are noted.
.
Capsule study [**2175-10-5**]
1) No bleeding source identified t
