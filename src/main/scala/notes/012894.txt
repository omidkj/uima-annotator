History of Present Illness:
This is a 54 yo male who presented to [**Hospital1 2436**] with 4-5 days
of malaise and chills, painful nodes starting on
fingers/toes/skin, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU given concern for
endocarditis and for closer monitoring. Pt stated that starting

fever, chills, sweats and shakes. His highest recorded temp was
100. He endorsed myalgias, arthralgias, that initiated in his
right knee, and then became worse in his left wrist and left
shoulder. He has also had a rash on his forehead for several
days, non-pruritic. He denied any SOB, cough, HA, CP, urinary
syx, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody or black stools. He also
reported blurred vision for the few days prior to admission.
Additionally, he had some visual hallucinations first noticed a
couple of days prior to admission seeing columns and "weird
lines" in his visual field. His wife also reported that he was
responding to auditory stimuli, but pt does not recall this. He
denied any sick contacts, though his wife has been in and out of
the hospital for RA flares requiring admission for solumedrol
infusions. His recent travel includes visiting his sons in [**Name2 (NI) **],
and he does work outside, but regularly checks for ticks but
denies any recent bites. He denied any recent dental work. He
was seen by his PCP 1 day prior to admission and was started on
cephalexin for a skin infection on forehead. He did not improve,
and presented to [**Hospital1 2436**] ED this on [**12-18**] because of "not
being able to get out of his chair" because of weakness. When
seen at [**Hospital1 2436**] ED, initial BP 78/51, was felt to have
endocarditis with septic emboli, with new murmur and
thrombocytopenia. Bedside Echo showed mild MR but no vegetations

was intact but reported recent episodes of confusion. Peripheral
stigmata c/w endocarditis. EKG showed SR with nonspecific ST-T
changes. Blood cultures drawn, and he was given one dose of
Gentamicin. CXR and L shoulder film (has shoulder pain) pending.
