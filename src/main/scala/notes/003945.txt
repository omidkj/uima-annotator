History of Present Illness:
88yo M with history of SC lung cancer s/p RLL lobectomy [**2164**],
recent hospitalization with low back pain found to have new
lesions in spine and hip, delerium, [**Doctor First Name 48**] improved with IVF, MSSA
bacteremia/PNA discharged on Nafcillin to be completed [**10-9**],
presents with sudden onset hypoxia this morning, with O2 sat
dropping to 81% at rehab and associated shortness of breath. He
was placed on 4L NC at that time. Notably patient also had some
urinary retention yesterday when at the hospital to have
radiation tattooing done, had a Foley placed yesterday, and he
has had gross hematuria since. He was taken to [**Hospital1 **] today where he was found to be anemic as well as to
have a UTI, and an elevated troponin to .4 in the setting of
atrial flutter/sinus tachycardia. Hct was also noted to drop
from 27-24. H receved asa 162 mg, oxycodone 5mg, zofran 4mg and
dilaudid 0.5 mg IV there.
.
Baseline sats at rehab have been 95-08 on 2L intermittently per
patient. Today sat to 79-80 on 2L. Notes show right leg swelling
U/S two days ago negative.
.
Initial Vitals/Trigger: 97.6 114 179/95 19 97%6L. He denies
chest pain or abdominal pain, however he does endorse shortness
of breath which has somewhat resolved since he's been placed on
a nasal cannula at 4 L.
.
EKG showed atrial flutter. He was guiaic negative. Ceftriaxone
was given at 1245. Potassium was also give 1230 as well as

Imaging:
CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary emboli in the subsegmental branches of the left
lower lobe and
anterior left upper lobe with no evidence of right heart strain
or pulmonary
infarction.
2. New patchy consolidation in the dependent portion of the
right upper lobe
likely represents pneumonia or aspiration. Ground glass
opacities in a
bronchovascular distribution in the left upper lobe may
represent multifocal
pneumonia or significant aspiration event.
.
CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No brain metastases identified.
2. There is no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage;
however, subtle
subarachnoid hemorrhage cannot be excluded on this study due to
circulating
intravenous contrast.
.
CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC
line was
removed. Status post right lower lobe resection with subsequent
volume loss
of the right lung. Presence of a minimal right pleural effusion
cannot be
excluded.

No newly appeared parenchymal opacities. No pulmonary edema. No
pneumonia.
Unchanged asymmetry of the tracheal course through the
mediastinum.
.
LENI:
IMPRESSION: Peroneal calf veins not visualized in either lower
extremities.
Otherwise, no DVT present
.
CXR:
Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged. Patient is
status post
right lower lobectomy. The lungs are grossly clear with the
surgical clips
projecting in the right medial upper hemithorax. Unchanged right
apical
pleural thickening and blunting of the right CP angle are likely
postoperative
changes. Aeration of the right lung has improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
88yo M with history of SC lung cancer s/p RLL lobectomy [**2164**],
recent hospitalization with low back pain found to have new
lesions in spine and hip, delerium, [**Doctor First Name 48**] improved with IVF, MSSA
bacteremia/PNA discharged on Nafcillin to be completed [**10-9**],
presented with sudden onset hypoxia found to have bilateral
subsegmental PEs, PNA and fluid overlead.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# HYPOXIA: Initial deterioration was likely [**3-7**] PE and
aspiration PNA. Patient was initially started heparin gtt then
bridged to lovenox and was initially placed on Vanco/Zosyn. As
patient became afebrile, he was placed on Augmentin and remained
afebrile. ***LAST DAY OF ANTIBIOTICS WILL BE ON [**10-24**].*** Hypoxic
continued despite adequate PE and PNA coverage; exam revealed
hypervolemic state. Patient was diursed with IV lasix 20mg.
Serum Bicarbonate started raising patient and diuresis
terminated. Patient was briefly off oxygen however then
restarted o2 at 2 liters. This remaining hypoxia was attributed
to PE. Patient will remain on lovenox indefinitely.
.
# LOWER EXTREMITY WEAKNESS/HIP PAIN/URINARY RETENTION: Symptoms
were attributed bony metastasis. Patient started radiation
therapy and will compelte treatments on Monday [**10-22**]. Patient was
started on steroids to help with inflammation. Patient will
remain on this dose of steroids until [**10-22**] then he can began
taper (2
