History of Present Illness:
77M with h/o COPD with home O2 qhs and lung cancer (T2Nx NSCLC)
who presented to clinic today to receive his first radiation
treatment with CyberKnife.  He reports increased SOB x 1wk,
cough productive of white/brown sputum x few weeks, and
increased swelling of lower extremities x few weeks.  Patient
diagnosed with URI last week by PCP and completed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 6 day course
of an antibiotic (does not know which) one day prior to
admission with minimal improvement.  Per daughter patient has
been increasingly lethargic at home x 1 week, getting out of bed
only to go to the bathroom.  Patient also has been using oxygen
all day instead of just at night.

In clinic he was found to be tachypneic (RR40), dyspneic, and
mildly hypoxic (O2sat 88-93%) and with an irregular pulse.
Patient was sent to the ED for further evaluation.

ROS: Denies chest pain, abd pain, dysuria, abnormal bowel
habits.  Has stable 2 pillow orthopnea, denied PND. Appetite has
been good.

ED course: T 97.1 BP 132/79 HR 91  RR24 Sat 99% 5L (93% RA)
Patient noted to be lethargic, sleepy on presentation but had
just taken 0.5mg Ativan and 4mg Dexamethasone (for radiation
treatment). Received Atrovent/Albuterol nebs, Solu-medrol 125mg
iv x1, CTX/Azithro and Kayexalate for hyperkalemia. Patient
found to be somnolent with ABG 7.28/78/86.  BiPAP initiated.  RT
later decreased FiO2 to decrease O2sat with improved mentation.
Patient admitted to ICU on 2L NC for further management.

Studies:
EKG: AFib at 127. no acute ischemic changes.
.
CXR [**2123-1-29**]: Atelectasis and moderate sized pleural effusion seen
in the area of the known right middle lobe mass. No evidence of
pneumothorax.
.
CTA [**2123-1-29**]: Again noted is an obstructing mass in the right
middle lobe with a similar appearance. As noted on the very
recent prior CT, the mass encases the hilar vessels in the right
middle lobe, and there is distal partial collapse of the right
middle lobe. There is a similar appearance of a right-sided
pleural effusion, with peribronchial thickening in the right
lower lobe. Again noted are multiple small mediastinal lymph
nodes, which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism, and the heart and
pericardium are unremarkable. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
[**2123-2-1**] Echocardiography:
Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
probably at least mild aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. At least trace mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of  [**2122-10-5**], the degree of pulmonary hypertension
detected has increased.

[**2123-2-1**] Chest X-ray:  AP chest compared to [**1-29**] and
[**1-5**]:
Small right pleural effusion has increased since [**1-29**]
collecting along the diaphragmatic and lower costal surface of
the right lung adjacent to consolidation surrounding a right
middle lobe mass demonstrated on plain chest films from [**1-5**]. Right middle lobe is probably collapsed. Left lung is
clear. The heart is normal size. Thoracic aorta is tortuous and
heavily calcified, but unchanged in overall caliber. There is no
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 77 year old gentleman with COPD (on home O2), atrial
fibrillation, smoking, and recently diagnosed lung cancer (T2Nx
NSCLC).  He initially presented to clinic on [**2123-1-29**] for his
first radiation treatment with CyberKnife. He had been feeling
more dyspneic for about a month. The day of admission he noted
this was getting worse and he required more frequent O2
requirement (all day vs qhs), along with productive cough,
lethargy, and increased LE edema.  Of note, the patient had
taken Ativan prior to his schedule radiation treatment. He had
recently recently treated for a URI with a 6 day course of ABX.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt received Atrovent/Albuterol nebulizers,
Solu-medrol 125mg iv x1, Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin and Kayexalate
for hyperkalemia. Patient noted to be somnolent with ABG
7.28/78/86.  BiPAP was initiated. Mentation improved with
downward adjustment of FiO2. Upon admission to [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive
Care Unit ([**Hospital Unit Name 153**]) he was saturation 2L NC. He did not require
intubation.

In [**Name (NI) 153**] pt was noted to be volume overloaded by exam with
signifcant LE swelling and JVD. Pt was also noted to be in
atrial fibrillation by telemetry. CXR notable for new R pleural
effusion as well as for previously seen RML mass. He was
diuresed with IV lasix and his fluid balance was approximately
-700 mL for LOS in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He was continued on prednisone for
presumed COPD exacerbation, and continued empirically on
levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia.  He reverted to sinus
rhythm. On HD3 he was transferred to the floor.  By this time he
had continued to be mentating appropriately and had been
afebrile for 48 h. His oxygen was roughly 93% on 2L.  He was
somewhat tachypneic but has otherwise been hemodynamically
stable.  Per pt and wife, they felt his LE edema h
