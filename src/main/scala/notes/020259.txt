Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M h/o ?CAD, diastolic CHF, chronic A.F., ESRD on HD who
developed mental status changes after dialysis on Friday and was
admitted with a multilobar, possibly bilateral pneumonia.

1. Pneumonia - Originally diagnosed based on fever, elevated
wbc, and chest x ray findings. Although final read of the cxr
was more consistent with chf, the pulmonologists felt it was
more consistent with PNA. He recieved 500mg IV levaquin in the
ED, and then had vancomycin added to broaden his covereage. He
was admitted to the MICU, but did not require intubation or
BiPap. He did well and was called out in less than 48 hours. No
sputum or blood cultures returned positive. The patient
continued to have some respiratory difficulties on the floor and
had vancomycin restarted. He was dialyzed for volume overload.
He continued to have an oxygen requirement and worsening
delirium. Given his overall worsening status, his multiple
cormorbidities, and his poor quality of life at home, the
decision was made to make the patient comfort measures. This
decision was reached by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**], the
patient's wife and family. Mr. [**Known lastname **] passed away on [**2129-5-2**]
at 6:15 am.

2. Delirium- patient was agitated in the setting of hypoxia and
illness. He initially required sedation with haldol until his
clinical condition improved. These medications were tapered off,
but he became increasing more agitated and restless. They were
reinstituted. A source of delirium was done with UA, cxr,
telemetry, cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, Head CT. These were
all remarkable. No source was clearly found and it was thought
to be multifactorial.

3. ESRD - Patient was seen by renal. He underwent hemodialysis.
Following the patient's worsening clinical and mental status,
the decision was made to stop dialysis and make the patient
comfort care.

4. Vision problems: patient had long history of difficulty with
his vision. He had known cataracts and ischemic optic
neuropathy. During his hospitalization, he noted lack of vision
in his right eye. This occurrred in the setting of delirium. The
true nature of his symptoms could not be determined.
Opthalmology was consulted and did not find any new lesions or
ischemic changes in the eye.
