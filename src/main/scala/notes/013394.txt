Chief Complaint:
Intermittent worsening chest burning for 1 month


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2159-12-17**]

History of Present Illness:
64 yo F with hx HLD and extensive smoking history (abstaining
for 3 years to date) who presents with chest burning for 1
month.
.
Was in her usual health and exercising regularly at the gym,
able to walk at 3mph on the treadmill and lift weights without
anginal symptoms, until about a month ago when she was on a
cruise to the Caribbean - she starting having intermittent
substernal chest burning on exertion without diaphoresis or
sweating and no radiation. She continued to have these symptoms
with exertion and over the past month she has had them more
frequently, but notes that she could still exercise as usual at
the gym and has not had the symptoms at rest.
.
The day prior to admission, she saw her PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] right handed
palmar cyst on her tendon, and told the physician about her
symptoms - she underwent stress, which showed infero-lateral
ischemia. She was loaded with 300 mg of Plavix the day prior to
admission in preparation for catheterization and took 75 mg the
morning of admission. She was then directly admitted for
catheterization the day of admission, which she underwent today
and which showed 3 vessel disease: -LMCA disease 60-70% -RCA 90%
-Moderate lcx disease.

Conclusions
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass: Patient is AV paced, later A paced. Initial RV
appears hypokinetic but improves with time and low dose (0.01
mcg/kg/min) epinepherine. LV function unchanged. Aortic contours
intact. MR remains mild. Remaining exam is unchanged. All
Findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo F with hx HLD and extensive smoking history (abstaining
for 3 years to date) who presents with chest burning for 1 month
- found to have 3VD on Cath and now scheduled for CABG after
Plavix washout.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2159-12-17**] where
the patient underwent Coronary Artery Bypass with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
The patient did have an air leak in the pleurevac and chest
tubes remained in place for extra days.  Air leak resolved and
chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  She did develop a urinary tract infection which
was treated with ciprofloxacin.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 7, the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
