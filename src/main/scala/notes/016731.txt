History of Present Illness:
This is an 85-year-old nun with a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and CAD, s/p CABG x 3 and stents in
[**1-/2146**] and 10/[**2146**]. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2147-10-29**]
with complaints of chest pain. Pt reports CP never really
resolved after last stent; unable to ambulate to bathroom
without pain and SOB. CP does not occur at rest; always
associated with SOB, denies N/V, lightheadedness, diaphoresis.
Baseline orthopnea, sleeps in chair; reports LE edema that is
improved from baseline. Denies palpitations. At OSHh she ruled
in for a NSTEMI with a peak troponin of 0.95. She underwent
cardiac catheterization yesterday and was found to have a lesion
in the SVG from the diag to the OM-1. Her EF was reported as
25-30%. Last night at OSH s/p cath; pt has persistant chest
pain. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for interventional cath. Cath
was done; PCI to graft ostium with BMS, 2 BMS to mid-graft
lesions.

Pertinent Results:
[**11-1**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Selective venous conduit angiography demonstrated a
diffusely
diseased SVG graft to the obtuse marginal with a jump segment to
the
diagonal.  The ostial portion of the graft demonstrated a 60%
lesion.
The graft also had a 90% lesion just proximal to the anastomosis
site on
the obtuse marginal along with a 70% lesion just proximal to the

anastomosis site on the diagonal.
2.  LV ventriculography was deferred.
3.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated severe central
hypertension (180/72 mm Hg).
4.  Successful direct stenting of the ostium of the SVG-OM-Diag
with an
Ultra (4.5x13mm) bare metal stent.  Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, 10% residual stenosis and
TIMI III
flow throughout (See PTCA comments).
5.  Successful direct stenting of the distal SVG-OM graft with a
Vision
(4x12mm) bare metal stent.  Final angiography demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III
flow throughout (See PTCA comments).
6.  Successful direct stenting of the SVG jump graft to the
diagonal
with a Vision (4x12mm) bare metal stent.  Final angiographyc
demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, 20%
residual
stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout (See PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One (1) venous conduit (SVG) disease.
2. Successful direct stenting of the SVG-OM-Diag with three bare
metal
stents.

[**2147-11-4**] CXR:
Worsening pulmonary edema.

Portable semi-upright chest radiograph is compared to the prior
study.  There is cardiomegaly.  There is tortuosity of the
aorta, which appears to be somewhat ectatic as well.  There is a
patchy opacity at the right lung base, which has diminished in
size since the prior study.  The remainder of the lungs are
clear.  There does not appear to be failure at this time.


CT abd/pelvis [**11-2**]:
1.  Left groin subcutaneous hematoma, without evidence of
retroperitoneal
hemorrhage.
2.  Retained renal contrast is compatible with acute tubular
necrosis.
3.  Cholelithiasis.
4.  Colonic diverticulosis, without additional findings to
suggest
diverticulitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. CAD-Patient was initally admitted from OSH for interventional
cath.  On [**11-1**] she underwent PCI which demonstrated a diffusely
diseased SVG graft to the obtuse marginal with a jump segment to
the diagonal.  The ostial portion of the graft demonstrated a
60% lesion. The graft also had a 90% lesion just proximal to the
anastomosis site on the obtuse marginal along with a 70% lesion
just proximal to the
anastomosis site on the diagonal. She underwent successful
direct stenting of the SVG-OM-Diag with three bare metal stents
which showed TIMI III flow after. The patient was continued on
her home aspirin, plavix, [**Last Name (un) **], nitrate and beta blocker. She
received both pre and post-cath  hydration as well as mucomist.
The patient had a brief episode of hypotension on hospital day
#2 which resolved on its own.  She received 500cc fluids with
improvement in her BP.  An EKG was done which showed some deeper
TWI in V2-V6.  A CT abdomen was done which did not show any
evidence of RP Bleed. On hospital day #3, the patient had a
rapidly expanding hematoma which was evacuated by vascular
surgery and an corrected pseudoaneurysm (see details below).
HCT was stable, nadir 18 but stable in the low 30s after
surgical evacuation / repair.  Patients cardiac enzymes were
also trended post-cath. First set showed CK 73 (-->77). Troponin
was 0.21.  Troponin peak at 0.37, CK peak at 77. Patient was
subsequently stable from a cardiac standpoint and sent home on
her home asa, plavix, [**Last Name (un) **] and beta blocker. Nitrate was
discontinued.
.
#.Systolic heart failure: Pt has CHF with EF 30%.   A an ECHO
was done after her hematoma and hypotensive episode to make sure
there was no evidence of pericardial effusion or new ischemia.
ECHO showed Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
moderate global/regional systolic dysfunction. Mild calcific
aortic stenosis.  Pts Lasix was held briefly during hypotensive
episode but restarted once her BP stabilized. She was also
continued on her [**Last Name (un) **] and BB.
.
#Acute Renal Failure-Pt had a Cr 1.1 at the OSH and was found to
be 1.4 post-cath.  The CT abdomen on [**11-2**] demonstrated contrast
in her kidneys and collecting ducts consistent with ATN.  Her
meds were renally dose and all nephrotoxins were avoided.  Her
creatinine subsequently improved throughout her hospitalization
and remained stable.
.
2) Bradycardia: Patient stayed in NSR with a rate in the 60s.
She did have an episode of bradycardia reported by surgeons
which was thought to be a vagal episode (given concurrent report
that SBPs were elevated). There were no further episodes of
bradycardia throughout the rest of her course. She was monitored
on tele with no events.
.

4) Valve: Has a murmur on [**Month/Year (2) **] and ECHO notable for mild AS ([**Location (un) 109**]
1.2-1.9cm2). Peak gradient of 29mmHg, velocity of 2.7m/s. Also
has 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Currently do not appear to be affecting pt's
hemodynamics. No active issues during hospitaliztion.
.
#) HYPOTENSION/HYPERTENSION: Pt had episode of hypotension in
the OR likely due to large volume of acute blood loss. She
received a total of 6uprbcs both intra- and post-operatively
with good result. Her BP subsequently remained stable.  Meds
were intially held but as her BP remained stable, her
Carvedilol, Valsartan and Lasix restarted.  Her Imdur was held
upon discharge.
.
#) HEMATOMA: On post-cath check initially, pt found to have a
small hematoma which i
