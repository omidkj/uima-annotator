History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 74 year old with a history of COPD, but no hx of
HTN, CAD, or stroke, who is transferred for further management
of
a L temporal lobe hemorrhage.  History is per OSH ED records and
per daughter.

Daughter reports that she talked to her mother around 1 PM today
on the telephone.  She was complaining of a headache, and that
her breathing was "off."  Her daughter encouraged her to push
her
lifeline, and arranged for some family to go and visit her.  She
talked to her again around 2:15, and she said that the headache
was a bit better, but that her breathing was "not good."  She
called another family member (not her daughter, [**Name (NI) **]) around
2:40, and left a message.  They report that she sounded
confused,
and said "[**Doctor First Name **], I need you..." (although it was not [**Doctor First Name **]
that
she had called)  Her daughter got a call later that she her
mother was in the [**Name (NI) **].  She spoke to a nurse, who told her that
her mother's speech was garbled (said "my throat back hurts" for
example) and wondered whether this was normal for her.  Her
daughter said it wasn't, and encouraged them to do a Head CT.
Per OSH reports when pt. first arrived she was awake, alert, and
oriented x .  Her pupils were equal and reactive (no other exam
documented)  She was complaining of SOB, and on exam was
wheezing
and using accessory muscles to breath.  She was not complaining
of headache.  After talking to her daughter, and noticing that
she was more confused (at one point called the doctor [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 74144**] around this time per report) they took her to Head
CT.
They found a 6 x 4 cm L temporal lobar hemorrhage with 6 mm of
midline shift.  They intubated her for airway protection and
transferred her to [**Hospital1 18**].

Gen: Lying in bed, intubated
HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa
Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid
or vertebral bruit

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Intubated.  Opens eyes to voice, regards
examiner.
Follows simple commands (open/close eyes, squeeze hands, wiggle
toes)

Cranial Nerves: PERRL 3 -> 2 bilaterally.  R facial droop (UMN).

+ gag on ETT.  Blinks to threat L, not R.  Barely crosses
midline
to right, looks left with both eyes conjugately (too awake for
Dolls)

Motor/Sensory
Normal bulk bilaterally.  Decreased tone in right arm and leg.
Holds left arm and leg antigravity on command.  Withdraws R arm
purposefully to pain, but does not lift off bed.  Withdraws
right
leg to pain, not anti-gravity.  Grimaces to pain all 4
extremities.

Reflexes:
+2 and symmetric throughout L, slightly brisker on R
Toes downgoing L, upgoing R


Pertinent Results:
IMPRESSION: Relative to the prior examination obtained at
outside institution at approximately 17:30 the same day, the
large parenchymal hemorrhage at the left temporoparietal region
is again identified with a rim of vasogenic edema resulting in
left-sided cerebral sulcal effacement and approximately 5 mm of
midline shift. All these findings are stable compared to the
prior examination. There is evidence of uncal herniation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was maintained in the ICU for 13days without
interval improvement in her status.  Unfortunately the patient
ultimately succumed to her hemorrhagic stroke.  Prior to her
death, her family agreed to make her comfort measures only.  As
such she was extubated and kept comfortable on morphine.
