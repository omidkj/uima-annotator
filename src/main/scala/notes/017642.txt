Admission Date: [**2170-5-2**]        Discharge Date: [**2170-6-5**]

Date of Birth:  [**2093-12-30**]        Sex:  M

Service:  MED


HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory failure:  The patient was again
status post trach on [**5-16**] secondary to failure to extubate.
Of note during this hospitalization, events including a VATS
evacuation of the right hemothorax and  on [**5-9**].  The right
hemothorax was thought to be secondary to a complication of
chest compressions.

On follow-up x-ray upon discharge, the patient had a
persistent right loculated pleural effusion.  CT Surgery was
reconsulted before discharge, and they recommended no further
treatment at this time given no acute worsening of
respiratory status.

The patient remained trach dependent throughout this
hospitalization and required 50 percent trach mask throughout
his hospitalization.  The patient was continued on frequent
suctioning, as well as oxygen therapy after discharge from
the intra-coronary.

Acute renal failure:  Of note, during this hospitalization on
past discharge summary, the patient is thought to have acute
renal failure secondary to ATN, which is secondary to
cardiogenic shock, in addition to intravenous contrast given
during his cardiac catheterization, over diuresis, and
questionable  during the Intensive Care Unit stay.

Of note also, the patient was initiated on hemodialysis after
a catheter was placed by Interventional Radiology on [**2170-5-25**].  After the second day of hemodialysis, the patient was
transferred to the floor with a creatinine of 3.0; however,
the patient was becoming oliguric.  The patient was started
on Lasix 80 mg IV b.i.d..  The patient's BUN and creatinine
remained the same after 3-4 days of Lasix at this dose;
however, the patient's urine output increased remarkably up
to 2 L a day.

The Renal Team felt that the patient has no acute indications
to continue dialysis; however, upon discharge, his tunneled
IJ catheter will remain in place given the patient's 10-year
status and may need further hemodialysis in the near future.

The patient has anemia secondary to his renal disease and is
on Epogen.  The patient will need follow-up iron studies in
one month as iron studies here remained normal.  The patient
is on Calcitriol secondary to increased PTH.

Additionally in terms of volume status and dialysis, the
patient is to have daily weights checked and is to continue
intravenous Lasix at the outside hospital.  If the patient
has a weight gain of over 3 lbs and/or urine output is
decreasing, the patient may need hemodialysis per the Renal
Team.  Ideally his blood pressure should remain above
systolic of 100 to maintain renal perfusion.

Cardiovascular:  Of note during his MICU stay, the patient
had an urgent cardiac catheterization showing severe jugular
venous distension, including lesions in his left anterior
descending coronary artery which were severe diffuse disease
up to 80 percent in the distal left anterior descending
coronary artery.  This was intervened on with three stents
placed; however, his left circumflex continues to have a 70
percent lesion, a distal 90 percent lesion, and a 99 percent
stenosis in the left posterior descending coronary artery.
This additionally bifurcated on one branch with an 80 percent
stenosis of the lower branch and a 70 percent stenosis.  Of
note, right coronary artery was known to be totally occluded.

Once transferred to the floor, the patient had a hemodialysis
session at which the patient complained of chest pain and had
dynamic ST changes in lead V4 and V5 with ST depressions.
Cardiology was reconsulted, and combined efforts of
Cardiology and Renal stated that the patient is candidate for
cardiac catheterization in the future, however, would like to
hold off on cardiac catheterization until his renal function
returns to near normal.

Therefore, the patient will continue on his CAD medications
including his Aspirin, statin, Plavix, beta-blocker, and
additionally is on Nitroglycerin, and Hydralazine.  Of note,
the patient has multiple wall motion abnormalities on
echocardiogram including an akinetic apex.  The patient
should be considered to start Coumadin in the future given
his akinetic apex.

Congestive heart failure:  The patient has an ejection
fraction of 20 percent.  Of note, attempts were made to
diurese him in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with
Nesiritide and a Lasix drip.  These efforts were discontinued
given his worsening renal function; however on the floor, the
patient was restarted on Lasix 80 IV b.i.d. with good
response.  The patient is to continue diuresis upon discharge
with a goal of negative 500 to negative 1 L I&Os.  The
patient is to continue his Hydralazine and Isordil.

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia:  The patient was seen
by Electrophysiology in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
Based upon discharge to the floor, the patient had no runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  The patient is a
likely candidate for EPF in the future and possible AICD
placement.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] upon discharge and after renal function resolves.

Impaired mental status:  Of note, the patient became more
interactive once transferred to the floor.  The patient in
the Medical Intensive Care Unit had a negative MRI and
negative head CT.  Additionally, EEG showed diffuse changes
consistent with a broad differential.  The patient was
started on hemodialysis initially with thoughts that his
uremia was causing these mental status changes; however, with
dialysis, the patient's uremia improved; however, his mental
status did not improve drastically.  Most likely the patient
has a component of noxious brain injury given his episode of
ventricular fibrillation arrest.

FEN:  The patient had a PEG tube placed on [**5-17**] in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Speech and Swallow evaluation
was done on the floor which the patient passed and is to be
maintained on a pureed diet.

The patient was additionally on tube feeds which can be
slowly be weaned as his p.o. diet is increased.  This again
needs to be followed up at his acute rehabilitation.

Access:  The patient has a PICC line placed by IR on [**5-25**].

Code status:  The patient was maintained full code throughout
this admission.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Anemia:  Again the patient needs to
have iron studies done in one month, as he is on Epogen.

flushed twice a week and flushed with heparin afterwards.
The patient additionally is to have daily weights check with
a goal of another 500 cc negative 1 L initially.  If his
weight increases more than 3 lbs, the patient's Lasix dose
may need to be increased.
