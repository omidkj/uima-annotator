Admission Date:  [**2148-7-10**]       Discharge Date: [**2148-7-19**]


Service:  MICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**])

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
female with widely metastatic lymphoma who was admitted to
the hospital via the emergency room on [**2148-7-10**] for failure
to thrive.  She was admitted to the oncology service
initially where she was treated for urinary tract infection
and pneumonia.  She subsequently developed new onset atrial
fibrillation during the course of her stay on the oncology
floor with RVR to the 180s.  An EKG showed rate-related ST
depression in V4 and V5.  Rate control was attempted with
Lopressor and then subsequently with diltiazem.  Her rate did
not respond to these blocking agents, and she had exquisite
blood pressure sensitivity with frequent hypotension whenever
she was given one of these agents.  In the setting of this
new atrial fibrillation she was worked up for PE with lower
extremity Dopplers which were negative.  An echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of 70%, normal left atrial size,
mild aortic stenosis, no pericardial effusion.  She was
transferred to the intensive care unit on [**2148-7-12**] because of
atrial fibrillation with a rate up to the 180s and a blood
pressure drop to 80/palp with IV diltiazem.  At the time of
her admission to the intensive care unit, she was alert and
oriented to self only.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Primary extranodal non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, follicular, diagnosed in [**2143**] via biopsy of left
axillary node.  Status post CVP in [**2145**].  Status post XRT for
left iliac metastases.  Recurrence of left axillary lymphoma
in [**2148**].  Known metastatic disease to spine, spleen, lungs,
pleura, mesentery and abdominal lymph nodes.  2. Diabetes
mellitus type 2.  3. Hypertension.  4. Lumbar spinal
stenosis.  5. Osteopenia.  6. Status post partial gastrectomy
for peptic ulcer disease.  7. Depression.  8. Urinary
retention.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  1. Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. twice a
day.  2. Colace.  3. Senna.  4. Subcutaneous heparin.  5.
Lactulose p.r.n.  6. Regular Insulin sliding scale.  7.
Risperidone 0.5 mg q.h.s.  8. Neutra-Phos b.i.d.  9.
Lansoprazole.  10. Iron.  11. Bethanechol.  12. Allopurinol.
13. Ceftriaxone 1 gram q. 24 hours.  14. Azithromycin 250 mg
q. 24 hours.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband, a former
engineer, both are holocaust survivors.  She has one son and
one daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the unit her
temperature was 97.1, heart rate 139, blood pressure 126/48,
respiratory rate 31, 95% on two liters nasal cannula.
General examination was alert but oriented x self only,
recognizes and interacts with her husband, appears fatigued
and in mild respiratory distress, easily tearful and
agitated.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light, oropharynx with dried blood clots, dry mucous
membranes.  Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.  Jugular venous
pressure 9 cm.  Cardiac:  Irregularly irregular rhythm, 2/6
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border.  Lungs:
Expiratory wheezing left greater than right, no crackles on
anterior examination.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended,
nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly, normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities:  [**2-8**]+ pitting edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.2, hematocrit 41.5,
coagulation within normal limits.  Chem-7 normal except for
slightly elevated bicarbonate of 28.  CK 13, troponin less
than 0.3.  Calcium 9.1, phosphorous 4, magnesium 1.8.

Chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema, innumerable
pulmonary metastases, right lower lobe opacity and
retrocardiac opacity.

EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rate of 130, normal axis,
normal intervals, ST scooping in 1 and aVL, V5 and V6.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is an 82-year-old female
with widely metastatic lymphoma with abysmal prognosis
admitted to the intensive care unit for atrial fibrillation
with RVR and difficulty controlling rate secondary to blood
pressure sensitivity to nodal-blocking agents.  The patient
was full code at the time of admission to the intensive care
unit.

INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:  The patient was rate controlled
with amiodarone and Lopressor.  It was felt that she was a
poor candidate for long-term anticoagulation and she was not
started on heparin or Coumadin.  She was treated for a
urinary tract infection with resistant E. coli which was
sensitive to cefepime.  She has baseline hypoxia due to
innumerable pulmonary metastases as well as a postobstructive
right middle lobe collapse.  Throughout her intensive care
unit stay she has been stable on two liters nasal cannula.
Bilateral lower extremity Dopplers were negative for deep
venous thrombosis.

Over the course of her intensive care unit stay her mental
status progressively deteriorated.  Multiple discussions were
held with the husband and daughter regarding the grim
prognosis.  The family entertained trying one last cycle of
chemotherapy although they were advised that this would at
most buy them a little time and at worst cause clinical side
effects.  In the ensuing days with multiple contacts with the
husband and daughter, the husband began to voice a desire for
hospice care.  However it was felt that the husband would not
be able to handle having the patient at home and placement in
a hospice bed has been under way.

Initially the husband, Mr. [**Known lastname 98246**] [**Last Name (Titles) 98247**] much denial
about her prognosis.  He often stated that she can still
be saved and that "everyone beats cancer these days".  After
several extensive discussions in the presence of Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 98248**]
and his daughter, he clearly voiced that she never wanted to be
maintained on life-support or with chronic feeding tubes, and he
definitely wanted his wife to be comfortable.  Per his request,
all all blood sticks, intravenous access, and chemotherapy were
discontinued and focus care on comfort.  As of the time of
dictation on [**2148-7-19**], the patient is being screened for a
hospice bed.  In this context, CPR or other recussitation is not
indicated.

She is currently getting morphine p.r.n. for pain and
dyspnea.  She is not being fed or given intravenous fluids or any
medications.  When official hospice arrangements have been made,
an addendum will be dictated with a list of the discharge
medications.
