Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient seen and examined, chart reviewed. In brief, 77 year old
female with COPD on home O2, h/o T3 lung Ca s/p R pneumonectomy
presented to ED with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and admitted to
ICU on [**4-5**] for shortness of breath thought secondary to COPD
exacerbation. Patient N/V/D started day prior to ED presentation
with 4 episodes of non-bloody emesis and 4 episodes of diarrhea
and RUQ pain, sharp without radiation. In the workup of her abd
pain, RUQ U/S and CT abd were performed. RUQ U/S was negative,
and CT abd showed a peri-duodenal fluid collection. Surgery was
consulted, and they felt that no ABX were needed and this was an
incidental finding; recommended MRCP as an outpt. No sick
contacts, no recent travel, and no recent antibiotics. These
symptoms are now resolved.
She was observed overnight in ED, and was about to be discharged
when she had a nebulizer treatment and then developed acute
shortness of breath. She was admitted to MICU and had an
additional episode of acute shortness of breath associated with
duoneb treatment. It was felt that perhaps the nebulaizer itself
was causing her acute anxiety, or the albuterol was making her
tachycardic and more short of breath, although patient states
that she has used nebulaizers at home without difficulty. She is
on 2L nasal canula at home and finds she is using her oxygen
more frequently. Apporixmately 2 weeks ago she stopped her
spiriva as she felt this wasn't really helping her breathing.
Over the past week, she finds she is using the oxygen almost all
the time and has increased it to 2.5L nasal canula. She denies
fevers, chills. Occasional baseline non-productive cough. No
nightsweats. No CP, leg swelling. Her breathing is now back to
baseline. She was started on solumedrol in ICU and plan to
transition to prednisone taper on [**4-7**] and also started on
azithro for COPD flare.

CT [**Last Name (un) 103**] pelvis w/ contrats
IMPRESSION:
1.  Similar appearance of lung bases, nodular opacities in left
lung, right
pneumonectomy.

2.  Multiple large fibroids in uterus, which is unusual in a
postmenopausal
patient but noted on [**2193**] MRI hip. Followup can be based on
clinical
circumstance.

3.  Small left pleural effusion.

4.  Lobulated fluid collection in the wall of the second portion
of the
duodenum. No biliary ductal dilatation.  It is unclear if this
finding arises
from the bile duct, pancreas, or duodenum.  Differential
includes
choledochocele, duodenal duplication cyst, or pancreatic cystic
lesion as
well. MRI with gadolinium, BOPTA, and delayed imaging would be
useful for
further characterization.

5.  Calcifications in porta hepatis and left adrenal gland may
be sequela of
previous inflammation or trauma.

6.  Thick-walled bladder with anterior bladder wall
diverticulum.  Thickened
bladder wall can be better evaluated by cystoscopy.
