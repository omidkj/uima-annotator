History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 65 yo woman with a h/o Infiltrating ductal breast
cancer (Stage II) s/p right mastectomy and 4 cycles chemo also
with CAD s/p CABG who presents with 5 days of "excruciating"
headache and lack of coordination.  Patient notes that she was
working on a computer five days ago when she had an acute onset
of severe, constant headache localized to the top of her head.
She notes that she has not had a similar headache before, noting
that it was the worst headache of her life. She tried Tylenol
and Motrin with no improvement.  She notes that the HA worsens
when standing and when bending over.  She notes that since the
headache, she has been veering to the left and walking into
objects on the left despite being able to see them.

On the day of admission, she was bending over and lost her
balance and was not able to get back into position on her own.
She was, therefore, brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED by her daughter.
She denies N/V/D, photophobia, phonophobia, visual changes,
hearing changes, fevers, chills, weight loss, dysuria, vertigo,
dysarthria, aphasia, dysphagia, weakness, numbness, and
incontinence but notes night sweats for the last 5 days.

* Patient had severe exacerbation of headache on motor testing,
so portions were deferred.

Sensation: Intact to light touch and cold throughout. Perhaps
some extinction to DSS but only one out of three tries.

Reflexes:
+1 and symmetric throughout BUE.  Absent knees and ankles.
Toes up bilaterally

Coordination: finger-nose-finger normal, heel to shin normal,
RAMs normal.

Gait: Narrow based, mildly unsteady and wobbles twice.  Does not
seem to veer to one side.

Romberg: deferred as patient's headache was exacerbated by
standing and could not comply.

CTH: [**4-25**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple high-attenuation foci in bilateral cerebral
hemispheres. Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic,
hypervascular or adenocarcinomatous metastases.
2. There is a 6.8 mm leftward subfalcine herniation with early
uncal herniation.

MRI brain: [**4-26**]:
FINDINGS: There is extensive metastatic disease with multiple
rounded rim- enhancing lesions in all lobes of the brain. The
largest lesions include: A 1 x 0.9 cm mass at the left frontal
vertex, 2 x 1.6 cm mass in the right parietal lobe, 1.6 x 1.4 cm
mass in the right lentiform nucleus, 1.3 x 1.2 cm mass in the
right temporal cortex, 1.9 x 1.7 cm mass in the left cerebellar
hemisphere, and 1.5 x 1.2 cm mass in the right cerebellar
hemisphere, as well as multiple subcentimeter lesions. There is
moderate vasogenic edema, with severe extensive edema in the
right frontal and parietal lobes surrounding the right parietal
and right lentiform nucleus lesions. Mass effect and effacement
of the right lateral ventricle as well as subfalcine herniation
with 9 mm of leftward midline shift are stable from prior CT.
The suprasellar cisterns are poorly visualized and there is
distortion of the interpeduncular cistern. Nearly all of the
lesions demonstrate hypervascularity and hemorrhage.

IMPRESSION: Innumerable hypervascular and hemorrhagic metastases
throughout the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres with
extensive edema in the right frontal and parietal lobes and
evidence of subfalcine and early uncal herniation.

CXR: [**4-26**]: Left lower lobe mass as described highly suspicious
for metastatic spread.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt did well during stay. Pt started on decadron 4 Q6hrs.  With
question of worsening diplopia, pt'd decadron was increased to 4
Q4hrs.  Pt had whole brain radiation started on [**4-26**] (with goal
10 days of treatment). Neuro oncology evaluated her and will
follow her in brain tumor clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].Pt with diplopia
worse with lateral gaze to either direction suggestive of
bilateral VIth nerve palsies.  Pt was given patch with relief.
Her headache significantly improved with analgesia and steroids.


Pt was evaluated by physical therapy who felt that she would
initially benefit from rehab, however her exam improved and she
was felt to be safe to go home with home PT and OT.
