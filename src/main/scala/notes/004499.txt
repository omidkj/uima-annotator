History of Present Illness:
79 year old male w/ a h/o htn, hyperlipidemia, MVP and 2+ MR
diagnosed 2 years ago who was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2-28**] with
severe shortness of breath.  At the time of presentation, he was
found to have a loud murmur and an [**Month/Day (4) 113**] was repeated on [**2165-3-1**]
which showed worsening of his MR to 4+ with a new flail leaflet.
He was also noted to have 3+ TR with severe pulmonary
hypertension. The estimated peak pulmonary pressure of 100 mmHg.
EF was 65%.  Of note, he had fallen at home sometime prior to
admission and was c/o neck pain upon presentation. A C spine was
done which was negative.
.
Patient was admitted to the ICU.  He ruled out for MI with
serial
cardiac enzymes. He had no ischemic ECG changes. He was treated
with diuretics, beta blockers, and ace inhibitors without
significant improvement per her his physicians at the OSH.  He
remained hemodynamically stable with O2 sats in the high 90's on
4LNC and had no objective evidence of respiratory distress. He
did complain of cough at the OSH and was started on levaquin for
empiric coverage but there was no evidence of infiltrate on
repeated CXRs. All culture data was negative and he remained
afebrile. He had an elevated d dimer at the OSH and had a CTA
chest performed which was negative for PE. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for diagnostic catheterization and surgical evaluation.
.
In the 24 hours prior to transfer, patient became more confused
thought possibly related to ETOH withdrawal vs. low cardiac
output. He was given a dose of ativan at 11am on [**3-4**].  Patient
son notes that he is mildly confused at baseline but is more
confused than his baseline currently.  The son also notes
significant daily EtOH history.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient is awake, alert, and cooperative.

He is oriented x1.  He does note some shortness of breath but is
otherwise without complaint.  History is limited due to
confusion
but he denies any recent chest pain, fevers, chills,
nightsweats,
or any other new complaints.  He was taken directly to the cath
lab for RHC which showed elevated right and left sided filling
pressures. LHC showed non-obstructive CAD. An IABP was placed
and
he was transferred to the CCU.

INDICATION: Pleural effusion assessment.

Small left pleural effusion has slightly increased in size with
adjacent worsening atelectasis at the left lung base. Small
right pleural effusion is unchanged. The remainder of the exam
is also without change

Conclusions

The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous [**Month/Day (2) 113**]
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-40%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**1-30**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
elongated. There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. There
is partial mitral leaflet flail. An eccentric, XXX directed jet
of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
