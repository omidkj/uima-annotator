Pertinent Results:
Echo [**9-15**]:
Aortic Valve Area: *1.0 cm2 /  EF 50%
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of
the distal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract well.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be quantified. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.

Cath [**9-15**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a LEFT dominant
system with severe left main CAD. The vessels all had moderate
calcification. The LMCA was short and calcified. It had an
ostial 90% stenosis.  The LAD had a 50% proximal stenosis and
appeared to have aneurysmal dilatation both before and after
this stenosis. The remainder of the LAD had mild luminal
irregularities only. The LCX had mild luminal irregularities
only.  The RCA was non-dominat with no significant disease.
2. Hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left heart filling
pressures and moderately elevated right heart filling pressures.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension. The cardiac output and
index were preserved.
3. Assessment of the aortic valve revealed a 15-18mm Hg peak
aortic
gradient with a a valve area of 1.2cm2, consistent with moderate
aortic stenosis.
4. Left ventriculography was not performed.
5. Of note, there appeared to be an aneurysm in the abdominal
aorta
which meant that it was difficult to pass the J-wire up. A magic
torque wire was used. The aneurysm could well precluded IABP
use.
6. The patient's sheaths were sewn in place and she was taken
off the
table pending consideration of possible cardiac surgery. If she
is
refused this option, attempt to stent the LMCA may be done.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel (left main) coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Mild mitral regurgitation.
4. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
5. Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 85 yo female was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for
NSTEMI following at least one week history of chest pain.  At
[**Hospital1 18**], patient underwent cardiac catheterization and had stent
placement of left main coronary artery.  Of note, an AAA was
also found at the time of catheterization.  Following stent
placement, the patient was started on aspirin and Plavix, as
well as 80mg atorvastatin, 12.5mg metoprolol, and 10mg
lisinopril.  It is recommended that her blood pressure
medications be titrated for target BP of 125/75.  The patient
also underwent a TTE, which revealed moderated aortic stenosis,
mild mitral regurgitation, regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction consistent with CAD, 50% ejection fraction.  The
patient did not exhibit any further EKG changes or chest pain
following stent placement.  Cardiac enzymes trended down with a
peak CK of 93, 55 on day of discharge.  The patient was
monitored on telemetry, noted to have some ectopy, electrolytes
were monitored without any need for replacement.    The patient
was noted to have a history of anemia upon admission, and
required one unit of PRBCs to maintain a target hematocrit of
>30.  The patient's daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] prior to discharge to
discuss the need for follow-up with the patient's cardiologist
within 1-2 weeks.  In addition, the patient may need to undergo
repeat catheterization in [**1-22**] months to evaluate for further
disease.  In addition, the patient will need to have her
creatinine monitored due to her history of chronic renal
insufficiency, and a noted elevation in her creatinine thought
to be secondary to insult from catheterization dye.  It is
recommended that the creatinine be rechecked no later than the
Tuesday following discharge.  The patient maintained good urine
output throughout hospitalization, and did not require any IVF
as she was able to maintain adequate po intake.
        The patient was continued on Zyprexa for her history of
dementia, and a sitter was provided when necessary to ensure
patient safety.  The patient was also continued on her albuterol
inhaler PRN for her history of COPD and was maintained on a PPI
for GI protection, as well as subcutaneous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis.  Following catheterization, the patient was
restarted on and tolerated well a low sodium, heart healthy
diet.  In addition, the patient was evaluated by physical
therapy prior to discharge, it was recommended that patient
would benefit from PT at nursing home, with no acute issues
found.  The patient's daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] on the day of
discharge and informed of the follow-up that the patient would
require, and was agreeable to schedule the necessary
appointments.
