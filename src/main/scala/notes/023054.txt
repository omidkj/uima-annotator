Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation. Arterial line placement.

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]y F hx of atrial fibrillation (?systemic anticoagulation),
dCHF with chronic lower extremity edema, repaired AAA, and
chronic anemia presenting to the ED with shortness of breath,
cough, hypoxia admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure and
hypotension. Patient presenting from a nursing home with a
history of recurrent cellulitis, UTI and bacteremia. Patient was
alert and interactive on arrival and reports recent history of
shortness of breath and cough with po intake.

ED course: initial vitals 98.4 52 103/50 28 98% 15L
Non-Rebreather. Pt had low grade temp to 100.0 She was intubated
after failing trial of NIV [**2-14**] high volume of secretions. Her BP
nadir in systolic 80s and she was started on neosynephrine.
Subclavian R central line was placed. She was given aztreonam,
levofloxacin, and cefepime for empiric abx coverage. Chest xray
concerning for L sided effusion and chronic RLL changes. She was
bolused approx 1000ml NS but felt to be poorly responsive. She
also received calcium gluconate 4g total for hyperkalemia - no
EKG changes. Initial settings: AC 0.5/350/16/8. Vasopressin was
added at rate of 2.4 u/hr when pressures persisted in 70s
systolic. Neosynephrine increased to 5 mcg/kg/min and vitals
prior transfer notable for hr 129, SBP 80s. Vent settings
increased to fio2 0.5/380/20/8. CVP 15 but unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] form per

Pertinent micro:

Pertinent imaging:

[**11-10**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate
to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the left ventricle and an
LVEF of 30-35%. The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) tricuspid regurgitation. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No pericardial effusion seen. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular dysfunction.

[**11-10**] CXR:
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  However, a left lower lobe
consolidation is worsened compared to [**2143-7-8**].  Moderate
pleural effusion is likely.  New interstitial opacities are seen
throughout the left upper lobe. Right basilar opacities are
chronic and unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo female with hx of afib on warfarin, anemia, dCHF presenting
with hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# respiratory failure: Concerning for intrinsic pulmonary
infectious etiology. No hx of reactive airway or COPD. Could be
CHF exacerbation vs ARDS with possible urosepsis. CV O2 sat 74.
Started on empiric abx for HCAP (pcn, likely spurious vanco
allergy): levofloxacin, vancomycin, flagyl, aztreonam,
daptomycin x1, amikacin x1. Patient's oxygen saturation improved
to 100% on ventilation. SBT was attempted on hospital day 2 but
the patient failed. She was lucid and clearly uncomfortable. A
family meeting was held which re-affirmed the patient's
pre-existing wish to not be extubated for a protracted period.
She was extubated and died several hours later.

# hypotension: Appeared septic given lactate elevation,
tachycardia, WBC with left shift, fever. She was started on 3
pressors in the ED, which was weaned down to 2 pressures on day
of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission. Concern that poor response to pressors could
be related to acidemia. Possible sources of infection include
lung (CXR with [**Hospital Unit Name 9140**] LLL infiltrate compared to [**Month (only) **] and new
LUL opacities), skin (pt with recurrent cellulitis and venous
insufficiency in BLEs) and urine (UA positive). In addition, TTE
shows [**2-15**] of the distal LV hypokinetic with LVEF of 30-35%
compared to normal EF and wall motion in [**2141**], concerning for
regional cardiac event. Troponins 0.02 -> 0.05 -> 0.13, however
pt with [**Last Name (un) **] and flat MB, likely be due to demand ischemia. Blood
cultures came back positive for gram positive cocci in chains
and clusters. This speciated to Group B strep. Unfortunately the
patient's hypotension was s
