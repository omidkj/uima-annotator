Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 50416**] is a 67F with a PMH s/f pulmonary hypertension,
sarcoidosis and colon cancer on chemotherapy (s/p C3D15 of
cetuximab/rinotecan on [**4-8**]) who is presenting with a [**2-16**] day
history of chest pain.  The pain is described as substernal,
pleuritic, sharp, radiating to her back, unchanged quality from
prior. Pain initially [**10-24**] in severity.  Associated symptoms
include dyspnea, the patient denies diaphoresis, nausea or
vomiting. No F/C, denies [**Month/Year (2) **].
.
In the ED, initial VS were T: 97.2F, BP: 142/92, HR: 102, RR:
20, 100% 4L NC (on 3L NC at home). An EKG showed NSR with
nnormal axis and intervals and no ischemic ST or T-wave changes.
Initial CK was flat at 50, with troponin slightly elevated to
0.1, from a recent baseline around 0.8. A CTA was negative for
pulmonary embolism and demonstrated a new RUL opacity tracking
along the fissure, and thought by radiology to most likely
reflect plate-like atelectasis related to her history of
sarcoidosis. She was, however, given a dose of levofloxacin
750mg IV. Lower extremity dopplers were negative for DVTs.  Her
labs were otherwise normal except for her baseline elevated
bicarbonate. She was given Morphine IR 2mg IV x 3 for chest
pain, with some effect. Incidentally, patient has not taken any
of her antihypertensives today.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2177-4-13**] 2:35 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: eval for PE

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old woman with SOB, pleuritic chest pain, metastatic
cancer and edematous left leg with hypoxia on room air in the
70s
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 67-year-old woman with known sarcoidosis, metastatic
colon cancer, now with dyspnea.

COMPARISON: CTA of the chest from [**2177-3-28**] and CT of the
torso from [**2177-3-11**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scanning of the chest was performed
before and following intravenous contrast administration.
Multiplanar reformations were obtained.

FINDINGS: There are no central or segmental filling defects
within the tortuous and enlarged pulmonary arteries, whose
appearance is unchanged compared to prior studies. The heart
size is stable with atherosclerotic calcifications noted within
the coronary arteries as well as within the thoracic aorta.
There is no significant pericardial effusion. No lymphadenopathy
is appreciated. The thyroid remains heterogeneous with isthmic
and right-sided hypodensities suggestive of nodules.

Within the lungs, again noted is fibrosis and traction
bronchiectasis involving primarily the upper lobes. In addition,
there is a newly apparent more consolidative opacity in the
right upper lobe, tracking along the fissure and to a lesser
extent in the left upper lobe also along the fissure. There are
no pleural effusions. The central airways are patent.

In the visualized upper abdomen, note is made of an incompletely
evaluated large hypodense left upper quadrant mass whose
appearance is similar to the prior studies, measuring upwards of
9 cm. A calcified retrocrural lymphadenopathy is also noted and
unchanged. A hypodense posterior right lobe of the liver lesion
is stable.

IMPRESSION:

1. New opacity tracking along the major fissures bilaterally in
the upper lobes is suspicious for superimposed infection in the
setting of chronic changes due to sarcoid.

2. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism.

3. Enlarged pulmonary arteries, unchanged.

4. Large left upper quadrant abdominal mass and retrocrural
calcified lymphadenopathy, similar to prior studies and
compatible with metastatic disease.

5. Heterogeneous thyroid.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient initially presented for admission with shortness of
breath and persistent chest pain on [**2177-4-13**]. Initial evaluation
was generally unremarkable with LENIs negative for DVT, CTA not
suggestive of PE. She was diuresed with lasix prn. She also had
her pain medications uptitrated and in the setting of her new
pain regimen, she developed hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory
distress on [**2177-4-14**], necessitating transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and
NIPPV. At that time, her initial ABG was notable for PCO2 of
132. Patient improved significantly after receiving BiPap and
was called out to the floor.
Again on the floor she developed increased confusion on [**4-18**] with
slow response to questions and PCO2 of 97. She received NIPPV
overnight and improved and was called out to floor. On the floor
she received BIPAP at night. Received 500cc [**4-21**] for hypovolemic
hyponatremia an
