Service:  VASCULAR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with
a significant past medical history of coronary artery
disease, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft,
hypertension, and now has three to four months of right lower
extremity pain and a nonhealing ulcer.  He denies any
symptoms of claudication.  He does have rest pain however,
and there is no history of complaints like this in the past.
He denies any chest pain or shortness of breath, nausea or
vomiting, although, he occasionally has problems moving his
bowels and becomes constipated.  There is no history of
diabetes or stroke or kidney disease and there is no history
of smoking.

On [**2157-5-3**] as part of his preoperative cardiac
evaluation, he underwent a pharmacologic stress test, which
showed a small fixed defect in the base of the inferior wall,
mildly decreased left ventricular systolic function and no
electrocardiogram or anginal symptoms were noted.  His
preoperative chest x-ray showed cardiac enlargement without
evidence of congestive heart failure and so the patient was
taken to the Operating Room for his right ischemic foot
ulcer.

He underwent a right femoral tibial bypass graft.  In the
surgery, they used a left arm vein to make a composite bypass
graft conduit.  His anesthesia team had placed a PA line
preoperatively for hemodynamic monitoring.  He remained
intubated overnight on the day of his surgery and was
extubated the following morning.  Also, the morning after his
surgery, he received two units of packed red blood cells and
was followed hemodynamically.  He was then transferred to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit from the Recovery Room.

He remained in sinus rhythm over this time.  He was making
good urine.  His right graft pulse was palpable and he had a
strongly dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse.  He continued to
have invasive cardiac monitoring while he was in the Vascular
Intensive Care Unit. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw him at approximately 5PM at
which time he was hemodynamically stable, without any signs of
bleeding. At around 8 p.m. the started `to
have complaints of abdominal and right leg pain.  His right
calf was noted to be tense with pain on dorsiflexion and a
decreased intensity of his pulse exam.  He is also noted to
have some bleeding from the medial  incision.
Pressure was held and patient was taken urgently to the
Operating Room.

In the Operating Room , they noted bleeding which was controlled.
There was evacuation of hematoma and in general, the right
lower extremity was explored and bleeding was contained.  He
had an excellent graft pulse at the end of the case.  The
electrocardiogram of this patient was noted to have ST
depressions.  Three units of packed cells were transfused and
the patient was started on a Levophed drip, as well as
dobutamine.  At that point, Cardiology was consulted and the
patient was brought emergently to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory from the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.

It was determined at that point, that only his left internal
mammary artery graft was patent.  There was no medical or
Cardiology intervention that was possible and he was brought
to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit.  His hemodynamics
continued to deteriorate.  The first set of vital signs on
admission to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit on a drip
of 20 mg of dopamine and Levophed at 0.5:  A heart rate of
140 in atrial fibrillation and blood pressure of 150/80.  He
was intubated on a 100% assist control 1700 x 18 and required
a PEEP of 14.  His central venous pressure was greater than
20.  His PA numbers were 20 systolic, higher than 20s.  His
first gas was 7.16, 48, 48, 18, -11 and saturations were 80%.
His first output was 2.2 with an SVR in the [**2154**] range.
Lactate at that time was over 5.

Patient continued to be resuscitated both with pressors,
volume, bicarbonate, however, his hemodynamic status
continued to deteriorate.  At  Approximately 9 o'clock he
dropped his blood pressure, became hypotensive, had a
bradycardic event, became more hypotensive, and all pulses
were lost.  ACLS protocol was instituted, however, after
approximately 20 minutes of full code, he expired and his
time of death was 9:21.  The family was present in the
hospital during this event and was notified immediately and
had declined any autopsy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for:
1.  Coronary artery disease with an myocardial infarction in
[**2153**] subsequent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending and
vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal branches.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.
4.  Congestive heart failure with a depressed ejection
fraction.
5.  Gout.
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
7.  Peptic ulcer disease.
8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
9.  Spinal stenosis.
10. Peripheral neuropathy.
11. Cataracts.
12. Bilateral lower extremity edema.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor.
2.  Lasix.
3.  Allopurinol.
4.  Aspirin.
5.  Doxazosin.
6.  Subcutaneous heparin.

ALLERGIES:  He had no recorded medical allergies.  No smoking
or alcohol history.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post right lower extremity bypass using left arm
vein.
2.  Coronary artery disease with acute myocardial infarction
in the perioperative setting.
3.  Status post a cardiac catheterization demonstrating
patency only of his left internal mammary artery graft.
4.  Respiratory distress.
5.  Hypovolemia/anemia around operation from bleeding.
6.  Status post blood transfusions.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Peripheral vascular disease.
9.  History of congestive heart failure.
10. Gout.
11. Renal insufficiency.
12. Peptic ulcer disease.
13. Spinal stenosis.
14. Lower extremity edema.
15. Cataracts.
16. Neuropathies.
17. Status post cardiac arrest and death.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Death.
