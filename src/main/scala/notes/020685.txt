Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
suspected HUS-[**Hospital 70289**] transfer from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Temporary Quinton catheter placement
2. PICC placement x 2
3. tunnelled Quinton catheter placement
4. Intubation and Bronchoscopy
5. Tranesophageal Echocardiogram
6. Renal biopsy


History of Present Illness:
49 yo M with a history of ESRD, secondary to kidney transplant
failure who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for suspected
TTP-HUS. The patient reports that he has had six months of
increasing shortness of breath, fatigue and intermittent
blood-tinged productive cough. The shortness of breath has
become acutely worse over the last few days and he has had
symptoms of orthopnea.
.
The patient presented to the OSH and was noted to have bilateral
pleural effusions on chest CT, Hct 20.5, K 7.8 Cr 4.2 and
glucose > 400. He received several boluses of insulin and was
placed on an insulin gtt. He was also given an amp of D50,
calcium chloride, and kayexalate with subsequent decrease in K
to 5.9. He receieved 2 units of PRBCs which bumped his Hct to
24.7. He was placed on 4L NC for decreased O2 sat. Hematology
was consulted and felt that he needed plasmapheresis for
hemolytic uremic syndrome. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

Pertinent Results:
OSH RECORDS:
[**2171-12-6**] CHEST CT: CHF, RLL infiltrate
[**2171-12-4**] BNP 896, Rheumatoid factor 17 (0-13)
[**2171-11-15**] PFTs: FVC moderately reduce, FEV1 mildly to moderately
reduced/ FEV1/FVC = normal, TLC moderately reduced. Diffusion
severely reduced. Moderate restrictive disease w/ severe
reduction in diffusion capacity.
[**2171-11-15**] ECHO: EF 60-65%, mild concentric LVH, oderate biatrial
enlargement; mildr tricuspid and trace pulmonic regurgitation.
.
Renal transplant u/s: No hydronephrosis. Normal vascularity
throughout the transplanted renal parenchyma.
.
Bronchial washings [**12-13**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Reactive
bronchial epithelial cells, pulmonary macrophages, lymphocytes
and neutrophils.
.
CT chest: 1. Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis
involving large portions of both lower lobes. The possibility of
superimposed consolidation (reflecting pneumonia or aspiration)
is difficult to exclude.
2. Ascites and subcutaneous edema, consistent with diffuse third
spacing of fluid.
3. Small amount of hyperdense material within the gallbladder,
which may represent stones or sludge.
4. Tubes and lines positioned as described.
5. Three rounded soft tissue density structures between
posterior ribs near the spine as described, which may represent
lymph nodes.

TTE: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber  size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately  thickened. There is mild
to moderate aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic  regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic  hypertension. There is a trivialpericardial
effusion.
.
Bone Marrow biopsy: Peripheral blood granulocytic dysplasia,
along with dysplasia of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages in
the bone marrow aspirate raises the possibility of
myelodysplastic syndrome.  Blasts (peripheral blood and marrow)
were enumerated at <1%.  Ringed sideroblasts were not
identified.  In the absence of myelotoxic or myelo-stimulatory
therapy, the findings are suspicious for refractory cytopenia
with multi-lineage dysplasia (RCMD) in the WHO classification.
However, we note that the patient is critically ill, has end
stage renal disease and is under several medications.  Clinical,
pharmaco-therapeutic list and cytogenetic correlation is
recommended.  We further recommend a repeat biopsy for
confirmation and evaluation for definitive diagnosis.
.
Bronchial washings [**12-19**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Reactive
pulmonary macrophages and scattered yeast forms some of which
appear to be within cells.
.
R UE u/s: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
.
TEE [**1-6**]:
1 The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color
Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
3.The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in
diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No masses
or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is
seen (within
normal limits).
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT torso:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Again seen are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions
with associated atelectasis. There is also some ascites.
.
Renal u/s: No interval change in the appearance of the
transplanted kidney in the left lower quadrant. No
hydronephrosis. Normal vascularity of the transplanted kidney.
.
transplant biopsy:
1.  Chronic allograft nephropathy.
2.  Diabetic nephropathy.
3.  Changes consistent with "acute tubular necrosis", see note.
.
Repeat TEE [**1-15**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is  seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the  right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying  velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness abnd cavity size
are normal.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is a  focal simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve  leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild-moderate aortic stenosis is suggested (not
quantified). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There  is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo M w/ ESRD s/p kidney transplant on chronic
immunosuppressive therapy, presenting with AMS,
thrombocytopenia, ARF, hemolytic anemia and pancytopenia, and
respiratory failure with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, with
MDS on BM bx and persistent fevers of unknown origin, now on HD.

.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure/pulmonary edema: likely secondary
to volume overload in setting of ESRD +/- possible Ventilator
associated pneumonia.  EF by [**2171-12-16**] TTE was normal at 60% so
CHF unlikely contributor. Cultures revealed no growth and he
completed a 7 day course of zosyn/vancomycin for possible
ventilator associated pneumonia. He had some difficulty weaning
off of PEEP believed to be secondary to volume overload in the
setting of renal failure and his HD was increased to QD.
Following increased HD, he was able to be switched to pressure
support on the venti
