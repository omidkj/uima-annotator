EKG: ? underlying afib v paced. Reviewed with EP. APCs with v
paced and regular intervals at upper and lower limits of pacer.

.
Radiology:
CXR AP-bilateral pleural effusions unchanged from prior.
Retrocardiac opacification. Minor fissure with fluid.
.
Echo:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Normal RV. No AR;
Trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]; mild PA systolic hypertension. No
effusion.

[**12-6**] head CT: 1.  2-cm left subdural hematoma with mass effect
and mild shift of normally midline structures.

2.  Right scalp hematoma.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a moderately large and
relatively
acute, probably superimposed on chronic, subdural hematoma
layering over the  left convexity. There is significant mass
effect, with flattening of subjacent gyri, relative effacement
of ipsilateral sylvian fissure and components of the lateral
ventricle, and up to 8mm rightward shift of the right leaf of
the CSP. No other hemorrhage is seen. There is no skull fracture
associated with the large right frontal scalp subgaleal
hematoma.

[**12-10**] Head CT: 1.  Stable appearance status post evacuation of
left subdural hematoma, with persisting pneumocephalus and
hyperdense component, unchanged from the prior day's study.
2.  Stable appearance of the small focal hypodensity in the left
posterior
parietal cortex, of unclear etiology.  This may represent
evolving infarction versus contusion.  This could be reassessed
on followup study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 89 yo male with SSS s/p pacer, admitted to Neurosurgery
with SDH with acute respiratory distress/ wheezing on the floor.
Pt was transferred to the MICU diuresed then transferred to the
floor.

# SDH: Head CT at [**Hospital1 **] showed a moderately large and relatively
acute, subdural hematoma with significant mass effect 7 mm
midline shift. s/p L subdural evacuation on [**2157-12-8**]. The
patient will follow up with neurosurgery on [**2157-12-29**]. He has had
socme word finding difficulties since the accident, but
otherwise is well. On last Head CT [**2157-12-10**], pt had a stable
appearance status post evacuation of left subdural hematoma
persisting pneumocephalus unchanged.

In discussion with neurosurgery, aspirin was to be restarted in
4 weeks, given his SDH; note that pt. inadvertently received ASA
during this hospitalization; it should be restarted as an outpt.
in 4 weeks.

# Seizure: On [**12-16**] pt had an episode where he was awake, alert,
but unable to communicate. Stat head CT showed no new bleed or
stroke. the episode resolved in less than 3 hours. Neuro consult
felt this was a partial complex seizure. He was restarted on
dilantin (had been on it for 1 week after the surgery before).
His levels were monitored and found to be subtherapeutic, and he
was noted to have decreased communication and was reloaded on
dilantin per neurology recommendation.  Dilantin reloaded at 1 g
[**12-20**]; needs to have a dilantin and albumin level checked Friday
as per instructions in page 1.

# CHF: On [**2157-12-10**] in nursing notes, it is noted that pt was
wheezing. He was given albuterol and atrovent nebulizers. He
also received 10 mg IV lasix with 600 cc urine output which led
to improved respiratory status. Medicine consult was asked to
evaluate pt for respiratory distress. At time of MICU transfer,
he was diffusely wheezy, tachypnic to the 40s, with upper airway
sounds. ABG at that time was 7.47/30/154. CXR showed bilateral
pleural effusions unchanged from prior. Retrocardiac
opacification. Minor fissure with fluid. Pt stated that he could
not get enough air in and felt short of breath. He denied chest
pain. He was given albuterol and atrovent nebulizer treatments
as well as 20 mg IV lasix.

In MICU, pt sounded bronchospastic with diffuse wheezing
throughout. It also had a very large upper airway wheezing
component. He received nebulizers and lasix. After putting out
to the lasix a few hundred ccs, there was a dramatic improvement
in respiratory status (now -600 cc on 2 L NC). His Admit weight
was 62.4 kg which was 68 kg on transfer. He was diuresed in the
MICU with improvement in respiratory status. He responds well to
20mg IV lasix. Ecchocardiogram showed preserved systolic
function and tricuspid regurgitation. His medications were
changed with d/c of hydralazine, addition of captopril 12.5 tid
and increase of metoprolol to 37.5 tid. He has had good BP
control, he has diuresed 3L/2 days. He was also started on
salmeterol in addition to prn nebulizers and his respiratory
status is much improved, satting 98% on 2L n/c. He was then
started on tiotropium.

# UTI- He demonstrated dysuria, and given a change in mental
status, was treated empirically with ciprofloxacin.

# SSS s/p pacer- EP interrogated pacer. It was frequent APCs and
not afib. Uptitrated metoprolol to 37.5 tid.

# Anemia- Likely [**1-27**] OR and anemia od chronic disease. Ferritin
454. His hematocrit remained stable during his hospital course.

# Depression: Pt has had problems with anxiety for many years
was was taking xanax prn before admission. he was clonazepam and
was started on celexa.

# Swallowing: Ground; Nectar prethickened liquids after swallow
exam mainly because the patient refused to wear bottom dentures.
