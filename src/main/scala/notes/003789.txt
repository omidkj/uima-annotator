Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation x 2, central line insertion, tracheostomy [**11-23**], PEG
placement [**11-23**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 yo female with PMH of Alzheimer's disease,
depression, hypernatremia, paroxysmal afib who presents from her
NH.  Her son was called by the nursing home reporting a fever to
101 and O2 sat 84-86%.  She was then sent to the ED.
.
In the ED, she was noted to have altered mental status.  She was
nonverbal but responded to pain.  Exam was reported as otherwise
unremarkable other than rhonchi.  She was noted to be hypoxic to
89%.  Her CXR was ok.  Her ABG at that time was 7.37/58/178.
Subsequent ABG showed worsening hypercarbia at 66, so she was
intubated.  She was transiently hypotensive after intubation.
This improved with fluid.  Her HCT was in the 50s and her serum
sodium was 170.  She received 2L NS in the ED with 2 more
hanging upon transport to the ICU.  She was noted to have pyuria
and was givne vanc and zosyn.  Lactate in the ED was 1.4.  VS in
the ED: T 103.6 rectal  115/60  HR 52   RR 16  98% on 100%FiO2,
Peep 5 Tv 400.

Radiographic studies:
.
CXR [**11-12**]: Interstitial edema increased. Left retrocardiac
atelectasis also worsened. Small bilateral pleural effusions,
more marked on the left are unchanged. Calcifications of the
aortic arch and old right rib fractures are stable. Heart size
remains normal. Hilar contours are unchanged.
.
CXR [**11-20**]: FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular
central venous catheter and nasogastric tube appear unchanged.
There has been an interval worsening of the bilateral perihilar
opacities and probable slight increase in the layering bilateral
large pleural effusions. This could reflect developing pulmonary
edema although multifocal infection cannot be entirely excluded.

.
ECHO [**11-22**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Micro Data:
[**11-9**]: UCx w/proteus, sputum w/MRSA
[**11-18**]: sputum w/stenotrophomonas
BCx [**11-12**] negative
BCx [**11-18**], [**11-19**], [**11-20**], [**11-21**] pending
R IJ tip [**11-22**] culture negative
UCx x2 [**11-19**] negative
3x CDiff negative ([**11-12**], [**11-13**], [**11-14**])


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 yo with PMH of Alzheimer's dementia, hypernatremia, UTI
presents with AMS, sepsis physiology, UTI, and impressive
hypernatremia
.
#1 Sepsis: Initially presenting with fever, hypotension,
hypoxia.  Source was likely urine given pyuria, though may have
pneumonia as well given MRSA in sputum.  UCx grew out pan
sensitive proteus mirabilis, initial sputum grew MRSA.  BCx from
[**11-9**], [**11-12**] negative. BCx from [**11-18**], [**11-19**], [**11-20**], [**11-21**] all
pending.  Patient had short additional time in MICU when
required pressors for approx 48 hours.  Started on empiric zosyn
and gent for VAP. UCx during this time were negative and sputum
grew out Stenotrophomonas sensitive to Bactrim. IV Bactrim
started and zosyn/gent d/c.   Although blood pressure is low at
baseline, patient always makes urine.  Stool tests for C. diff
negative x 3 & flagyl stopped [**11-15**].
- completed 15d of vanco, was treated for 14d total for UTI
starting w/cipro/unasyn and switching to gent/zosyn (to double
cover for VAP)
- IV Bactrim 250mg Q8h for 14 days, starting [**11-24**] and finishing
on [**12-8**].
.
#2 Respiratory failure: Hypoxia and hypercarbia with spontaneous
breathing trials.  [**Month (only) 116**] now be volume overloaded due to fluid
resuscitation.  PNAs and deconditioning likely also contribute.
Patient failed SBTs due to RSBIs >130 and increasing acidosis.
Unclear why patient unable to be weaned off vent. Patient with
slightly hyperinflated [**Known lastname **]s and CO2 retention without acidosis
on admission. No Hx of COPD given but may be undiagnosed thus
far.  NIF poor at 16 with large amount of dead space ventilation
(70% on PSV).  Difficulty of weaning from the vent likely a mix
of decreased respiratory muscle strength combined with
underlying intrinsic [**Known lastname **] disease.
- Continue on Pressure support as tolerated and wean as
tolerated.
.
#3 Hypernatremia: likely from extreme dehydration.  Now
resolved.
Patient is currently getting free water boluses 100ml every 6
hours with tube feeds.  Continue to monitor sodium and adjust as
necessary.
.
#4 AMS: likely [**2-4**] toxic/metabolic, though other etiologies
could include stroke, and underlying dementia. Patient
increasingly alert as she is treated
.
#5 Hypotension: Resolved currently.  Dopamine drip weaned off.
ECHO relatively unremarkable given patient??????s age and does not
explain hypotension or bradycardia.  unclear etiology.  Lactate
and mixed venous do not suggest infection.  Pt did not respond
to fluid boluses and CVPs do not point to hypovolemia.  Repeat
ECHO w/normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global
and regional biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. [**Month (only) 116**] also be
unable to mount HR response wit
