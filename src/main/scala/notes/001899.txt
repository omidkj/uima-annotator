Admission Date:  [**2118-1-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2118-1-7**]


Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
81-year-old man presenting to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital Emergency
Department with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea times one day.
At the time of presentation, he was unable to give an
accurate history.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
questionable ischemia and was noted to have an acute
myocardial infarct with a troponin of 20.  On initial
presentation, he complained of diffuse abdominal pain without
fever or chills.  When he was admitted to the outside
hospital, he was found to have a distended gallbladder on a
CT of the abdomen and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
at that time.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, an arterial blood gas was
performed which showed a pH of 7.29, PC02 35, P02 58, and an
increased white blood cell count to 24.  While in the
Intensive Care Unit there, he was given a dose of Levaquin
and Flagyl and an ultrasound was performed which was
reportedly negative for cholelithiasis.  Initially on
presentation, his transaminases were normal, however, bumped
to the mid 500s while in the Intensive Care Unit.  He was
also found to have an elevated lactate level and, therefore,
was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] to
rule out bowel ischemia and was placed initially on the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Carcinoid tumor of the duodenum.
2.  GERD.
3.  COPD.
4.  Hypothyroidism.
5.  Hiatal hernia.
6.  Bilateral inguinal hernia repair.
7.  Status post right hip surgery.
8.  Status post appendectomy.
9.  Workup for lymphoma approximately one year ago per family
was reportedly negative.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Per family, no tobacco, alcohol, or drug
use.  He lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility with his wife.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE MICU SERVICE:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg.
2.  Protonix 40 q.d.
3.  Synthroid 75 micrograms q.d.
4.  Heparin drip.
5.  Flagyl 500 t.i.d.
6.  Unasyn 3 grams q. 12 hours.
7.  Fentanyl 100 micrograms per hour.
8.  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers p.r.n.
9.  Ativan 1 mg q. eight hours.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE MICU SERVICE:  Vital
signs:  Temperature 98.4, blood pressure 133/62, respiratory
rate 13, oxygen saturation 94% with ventilator settings, SIMV
500 cc by 20 breaths per minute, PEEP 10, FI02 50%.  Swan
numbers:  Pulmonary artery pressure 54/26, pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure 15, CVP 16, cardiac output 6.6,
index 3.5, SVR 848.  General:  The patient was intubated and
sedated.  HEENT:  His ENT tube was in place.  He blinks eyes
on occasion but not to commands.  The sclerae were anicteric.
The pupils were pinpoint.  On chest auscultation, he had
diminished breath sounds at the bilateral bases.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, distended,
diffusely tender to palpation with hypoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  He had 2+ lower extremity pitting edema, 2+
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally and
was extremely anasarcic.  Neurological:  He was intubated and
sedated.  He did not follow commands and was unresponsive to
sternal rub.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White count 25.3, hemoglobin
10, hematocrit 31.  The differential revealed 72%
neutrophils, 17% bands, 5% lymphocytes, platelets 108,000.
INR 2.2.  Fibrinogen 320.  FDP elevated at 80:160.  Sodium
141, potassium 5.2, chloride 108, bicarbonate 14, BUN 40,
creatinine 3.2.  LFTs:  ALT 3242, AST 3868, LDH 6084,
alkaline phosphatase 110, amylase 140, total bilirubin 0.7,
lipase 75.  Cardiac enzymes:  CK 529, CK MB 12, MB index 2.3,
troponin 24.1.  Hepatitis panel:  Hepatitis A IgG positive,
hepatitis A IgM negative, hepatitis B surface antibody
positive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis C
antibody negative.

PERTINENT RADIOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION DURING ADMISSION:
1.  Chest x-ray showed left upper lobe opacity and right
lower lobe infiltrate.
2.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis on admission, [**2118-1-3**],
showed small areas of low-density in the liver which likely
represented simple liver cysts, bilateral pleural effusions
with bibasilar consolidations, left kidney perinephric
changes from renal failure.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 81-year-old man presenting to the
outside hospital with a history of nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea times one day transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Surgical
Intensive Care Unit Service initially for question of gut
ischemia with leukocytosis and elevated lactate level.  He
was then transferred to the MICU Service with acute renal
failure, non-ST elevation MI, and shock liver.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially followed by the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit Service who performed an
ultrasound-guided aspiration of fluid surrounding at the
gallbladder.  There were no organisms shown by Gram's stain
and the culture was negative.  As there was no indication for
cholecystectomy at this time, attention was then focused on
whether surgical intervention would be indicated for possible
gut ischemia.  Given the patient's significant comorbid
illnesses at that time, it was felt that even if there were
signs of gut ischemia surgery could not safely be performed
and, therefore, he was transferred to the MICU Service for
optimization of medical management.

Cardiology was consulted as the patient ruled in for an acute
myocardial infarct with elevated troponin levels but no EKG
changes.  He was then evaluated by the Cardiology Consult
Team who felt that the non-ST elevation MI in the setting of
hypertension, tachycardia, and acidosis with relative
hypovolemia represented myocardial damage around the setting
of fixed CAD.  It was felt that optimizing medical treatment
would be appropriate.  Heparin was not felt necessary at this
time and, therefore, was discontinued.

The patient's condition continued to deteriorate despite
medical management and he became anuric by hospital day
number three.  His acidosis continued to worsen and his
lactate level peaked at approximately 9.2 with signs of
multiorgan failure including significant elevated
transaminases at 3,000, creatinine continued increasing and
anuria as well as myocardial infarct.

The grim prognosis was discussed with the family.  The
patient's daughter then brought in his advance directive
which stated that he had no wishes to be artificially kept
alive should a significant recovery not appear likely.  Life
sustaining support was then discontinued including withdrawal
of pressors and extubation on [**2118-1-7**].  The patient expired
at [**2118-1-7**] at 13:42.

The family member, [**Name (NI) 2127**] [**Name (NI) 3065**], who is the patient's
daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] and a request for an autopsy was made.

At the time of dictation, it is unclear the initiating event
of the patient's death; however, it seemed unlikely that this
was secondary to acute hepatitis given the normal hepatitis
serologies which were performed.  The autopsy results should
clarify the cause of death.
