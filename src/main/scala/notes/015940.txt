[**1-12**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
From Surgery:
.
Cholecystitis: An US in the Ed revealed A large gallstone is
within the neck of the gallbladder. The gallbladder wall is
thickened measuring up to 9 mm. The common bile duct is slightly
distended at 11 mm. There is mild intraheptic biliary ductal
dilatation. There is no pericholecystic fluid. Son[**Name (NI) 493**]
[**Name2 (NI) **] sign is positive. LFT's were elevated with an AlkPhos of
695. He had gallbladder drainage with 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter
at IR.
.
Cardiac Ischemia: Th pt had a history of CAD and CABG in '[**82**].
He had episodes of afib and tachycardia to the 120's, during
which he would become diaphoretic, clammy and likely ischemic
with EKG showing ST depression lead V2-V6.  On [**1-17**] he developed
a severe episode of apparent ischemia associated with SOB and
was transferred to the ICU (see below).
.
Hypokalemia: Potassium repletion
.
Dehydration: IV resuscitation
.
ID: He was started on IV Unasyn and Flagyl for empiric therapy.
.
From Medicine:
Assessment and Plan: 89 Russian-speaking male with dementia with
cholecystitis s/p perc chole now s/p afib with RVR and NSTEMI.
.
#) Hypoxemia: Trigger for hypoxemia every night after being
transferred to cardiology.  Based on CXR and the fact that he is
peri-NSTEMI with ongoing ischemia, likely [**2-6**] pulmonary edema.
- diuresis with IV furosmide
- O2 via shovel mask as he is a mouth breather
.
#) NTEMI: Family would like conservative management.  Likely in
setting of post-op stress.
- ASA, plavix, b-blocker, imdur, Ca channel blockers as blood
pressure tolerates
- goal HR in 50s
- trend CE
.

#) Cholecystitis s/p perc chole: Surgery following
- continue Amp/sul, metronidazole, change to pipercillin/tazo on
[**1-16**] given tachypnea and hypoxemia
.
#) R middle lobe PNA: Per ED nursing record, he was being
treated for a PNA at home.
- hold on additional antibiotics at this time.
- follow clinically
.
#) Oliguria:  Pre-renal based on urine lytes but volume overload
on CXR.  Does not appear dry on exam.  Could have had a
hypotensive episode during afib with RVR episode leading to ATN.
- foley in place
- monitor I/O
.
#) HTN: BP well-controlled.
- continue metop, nifedipine, isosorbide
.
#) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen
.
#) FEN: p.o. diet as tolerated
.
#) Access: PIVs
.
#) Communication: Daughter ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 20530**]
.
On [**1-17**] was transferred to the CCU for SOB secondary to
ischemia.  Because of the pateint's age and comorbidities, the
family opted not to pursue aggressive treatment strategies such
as cardiac catheterization.  THe pt developed MS changes and was
found to be less responsive (the day before he had been somewhat
combative).  He was tachypnic and tachycardic and appreared to
be developing cardiogenic shock.  He was transferred to the ICU
and started on pressors.  After discussion with the family
regarding their and the patient's wishes, his family opted for
comfort measures and he passed away 2 hours later.
