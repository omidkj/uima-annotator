Allergies:
Lorazepam / Penicillins / Prednisone / Hydrochlorothiazide /

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
progressing slowing of mentation and gait difficulties since
a week; evaluation for ICH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 83 yo R-handed man with a history of
multiple intracranial hemorrhages during the last few years,
pacemaker, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmia who now presents with
gradual decline in gait and slowing of mentation over the last
week.

The patient had a fall about ten days ago, when he was walking
the dog. The leash got wrapped around his legs. According to his
wife he had a small abrasion on the top of his head, but nothing
major. He did not complain about a headache. He was at baseline
with respect to his gait (at baseline unsteady, though he
refuses
to walk with a walker) and his mentation (at baseline
difficulties with memory since months; keeps forgetting
appointments). Then about a week ago, the patient and his wife
noted that his gait became even more unsteady, though he did not
fall. He also had difficulties navigating through his apartment,
having difficulties finding the fridge for example. They were
concerned that the fall might have caused another bleed, as had
happened in the past, and this prompted them to come to the ED.
No headache, neckpain, nausea, vomiting or focal
weakness/numbness.

Review of systems:
denies any fever, chills, weight loss, visual changes, hearing
changes, dysphagia, tingling, numbness, bowel-bladder
dysfunction, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
dysuria, hematuria, or bright red blood per rectum. His legs
have
been feeling weaker, bilaterally since the last week.

Past Medical History:
1. Previous interventricular hemorrhages: [**6-7**] resolved as of
repeat head CT one month later, no residual deficits; [**2-8**]: ICH
in 3rd, 4th, and L-lat ventricle; no aneurysm; [**6-8**]: ICH in
R-temporal lobe; question of underlying mass at that time per
contrast CT; decided to follow up with serial scans rather than
to biopsy
2. pacemaker placement for arrhythmia, Afibb; during last
hospitalization episodes of NSVT
3. history of slowness of gait, ?parkinsons? and possibly
dementia followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**]). Sinemet was
stopped during last admission [**6-7**] as he was thought to NOT have
PD.
4. Depression
5. COPD
6. hyperlipidemia
7. bilateral cataract surgery
8. orthostatic hypotension, on midodrine

Social History:
The pt. is married, independent in ADLS, lives with wife in a
retirement community.
Significant tobacco history x 40 yrs x 1ppd, quit 20 yrs ago,
Reported occassional glass of wine, no illicit drugs
He is a retired architect.

OSH placed ETT before asking her.

CT BRAIN (INITIAL)
FINDINGS: There is a 41 x 23 mm area of hyperdensity within the
right frontal lobe, with moderate surrounding vasogenic edema
(series 2, image 23), compatible with acute intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. The chronic encephalomalacic changes at the adjacent
right frontal lobe and the right parietal/occipital region
remain stable in appearance. There is mild mass effect upon the
anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.

No further intraaxial or extraaxial fluid collections or
hematoma are identified. There is no displacement of the
normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or effacement of the
basal cisterns at present.

Review of bone windows demonstrates no skull bulge or skull base
fracture. There is an air/fluid level within the right maxillary
sinus - ? acute sinusitis, but acute blood cannot be excluded,
in the setting of acute trauma.

CONCLUSION: 41 x 23 mm acute intraparenchymal hematoma at the
right frontal lobe, causing mild mass effect upon the
ipsilateral lateral ventricle, suspicious of hemorrhage
secondary to congophilic angiopathy in this age group. Chronic
encephalomalacic changes at the right frontal lobe and right
parietal/occipital region are unchanged in appearance since
[**2104-11-4**].

REPEAT HEAD CT [**3-7**]: no significant change from above.

EKG:
Atrial pacing. Since the previous tracing of [**2104-2-21**] atrial
pacing is a new finding. The electrocardiogram is otherwise,
unchanged and continues to [**Location (un) 381**] voltage in the limb leads
and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
