Pertinent Results:
POST BYPASS There is low normal right ventricular systolic
function. The left ventricle displays mild global hypokinesis
with an ejection fraction of about 40 to 45%. There is a
bioprosthesis in the aortic position. It appears well seated.
The leaflets can not be seen very well. There are two trace jets
of aortic regurgitation that are likely perivalvular but image
quality makes definitive diagnosis extremely difficult. The
maximum gradient through the valve is 12 mm Hg with a mean
gradient of 7 mm Hg at a cardiac output of about 4
liters/minute. The effective orifice area of the valve is about
1.7 cm2. There is trace mitral regurgitation. The ascending
aortic gradft can not be well seen. The rest of the thoracic
aorta appears intact after decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
