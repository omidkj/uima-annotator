Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 42 year-old male with a complex obstructive lung
disease due to a combination of bronchiectasis and tracheal
diverticuli, h/o hemoptysis, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], s/p RM
lobectomy, who is being transferred from NWH ED for recurrent
hemoptysis and fevers.
.
Of note, pt has a long h/o hemoptysis and recurrent abx for
bronchietasis. He has been coughing up brownish colored sputum
again since beginning of [**Month (only) 547**]. He c/o worsening DOE over the
last few weeks. Also occasional CP with deep inspiration. He
noted a fever of 101 on [**3-7**] and intermittently thereafter.
No nightsweats or weight loss. No sick contacts but travel to
South [**Country 10181**] from [**Month (only) 404**] to [**Month (only) 958**]. He was started on Levaquin on
[**2184-3-10**] but continued to have intermittent fevers and still
coughing up brownish sputum with occasional clots. Never frank
blood.
.
Pt went to NWH ED on [**3-19**]. He arrived with some respiratory
distress and frequent hemoptysis (1 TBSP frank blood q 10
minutes per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] note in OMR, not confirmed by patient).
He was satting 97%-100% on 4L NC, RR 28 to 38, HR in 100s, BP
110s/70s. Labs notable for WBC of 19.8 with 94% segs, 7% bands,
Hct 36.9, INR 1.2, UA negative. Suspected RLL pneumonia on CXR.
He received Vanc and Zosyn empirically and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
On arrival to the ICU, he spiked to 101.5, used accessory
respiratory muscles and was wheezing.
.
ROS: Notable for nonbloody diarrhea since having been started on
levaquin. The patient denies any weight loss, nightsweats,
abdominal pain, N/V, melena or dysuria.

CT Chest [**2180-12-19**]:
1) Overall unchanged appearance of extensive tracheal
diverticulosis, and extensive bronchiectasis in bilateral lower
lobes more prominent on the right, associated with patchy
parenchymal opacities and consolidations in the surrounding lung
parenchyma, and air-fluid levels within the dilated bronchus as
described above.

2) Unchanged appearance of soft tissue density in the right
lower lobe along the bronchovascular bundle as described above,
which is probably inflammatory due to sequela of bronchiectasis.

RENAL ULTRASOUND

FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.9 cm. The left kidney
measures 12.4 cm. No masses or hydronephrosis present within the
kidneys. A 6-mm non- obstructing renal calculus is present in
the interpolar region of the left kidney. The bladder is mildly
distended without focal mass lesion identified within.

IMPRESSION: 6-mm non-obstructing stone within the interpolar
region of the left kidney. No hydronephrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
42 year-old male with a complex obstructive lung disease due to
a combination of bronchiectasis and tracheal diverticuli, h/o
hemoptysis, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], s/p RM lobectomy, who is
being transferred from NWH ED for recurrent hemoptysis and
fevers.
.
Summary of MICU Course:  On arrival to the MICU the patient was
found to have a temperature of 101.5 and to have intermittent
bloody sputum (about the size of a quarter) and was
hemodynamically stable. He was started on vancomycin/zosyn to
cover likely levofloxacin-resistant pneumonia as RLL infiltrate
was seen on CXR. Due to his stability and small amount of
bleeding, bronchoscopy was not performed. He was treated with
guaifenesin/codeine cough suppressant with the thought that when
his bleeding further decreases this could be changed to chest
PT. He was given IVF for sinus tachycardia. Blood and sputum
cultures were pending at the time of his call out to the floor.
He became quite dyspneic and tachycardic with any amount of
exertion.

==================
  MEDICAL COURSE
==================

#. Hemoptysis: Known recurrent hemoptysis with known
long-standing h/o bronchietasis. Patient remained
hemodynamically stable and did not require any intervention.
Hemoptysis improved with treatment of underlying pneumonia.
.
#. Pneumonia: Althouth multiple sputum and blood cultures were
obtained, only positive culture was group A streptococcus from
outside hospital. Patient treated with Vanc/Zosyn empiracally
for 7 days of a planned 14 day course due to development of
acute renal failure of unknown etiology (for details see below).
Patient was kept without antibiotics for 2 days and treatment
completed wit 7 days of levaquin.
.
#. Acute Renal Failure: On day 5 of antibiotics, patient began
to exhibit increase in serum creatinine. No causes of pre-renal
or post renal azotemia were found. Workup was unrevealing for
cause of intrinsic azotemia, including for negative urine
eosinophils, negative ANCA/[**Doctor First Name **] and normal complement levels.
Antibiotics were stopped for suspected eosinophil negative acute
interstitial nephritis, with good improvement of renal failure,
with serum creatinine of 1.4 at time of discharge. Suspect Zosyn
is likely offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**], although patient has tolerated
penicillins in the past. Although we would avoid using Zosyn and
Vancomycin as possible, would not exclude using them in the
future as patients underlying lung process i
