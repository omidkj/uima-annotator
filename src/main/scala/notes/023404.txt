Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old man with history of myotonic dystrophy and
recent bronchitis who presents with dyspnea. He reports a
nonproductive cough x 3-4 weeks. When it didn't improve, he went
to his PCP and was started on azithromycin empirically for
bronchitis about 2 weeks ago. He finished his Z-pack, but
afterward his cough became worse. Two nights ago, he had
difficulty sleeping and didn't use his bipap. He felt better the
next morning, but that evening felt short of breath again and
was gasping for air. He couldn't tolerate his bipap due to
stuffy nose, and then had progressive dyspnea today. It became
so bad he decided to come to the ED.
.
In the ED, he was initially found to be hypoxic room air to 77%
initially. A NRB improved him to >90%, but he was switched to
CPAP for improved oxygenation, but didn't tolerate it due to
discomfort. He desatted to 75% on nonrebreather, and intubation
was discussed. On retrial of CPAP, he improved his sats to >99?
on 100% FiO2. He was given 500 mg PO levofloxacin and 40 mg IV
lasix with 1500 cc urine out through the time he arrived on the
floor. He was given 325 mg aspirin and started on a
nitroglycerin drip for SBP aroun 200. He was admitted ot the ICU
for hypoxic respiratory failure.


Past Medical History:
- myotonic dystrophy type II
- weakness in his mid and lower back, proximal LE's
- problems with his swallowing mechanism
- nocturnal hypoventilation
- right upper lobe and right middle lobectomy in [**2131**] for
pulmonary
nodules, which showed carcinoid by biopsy
- restrictive ventilatory defect (FVC 52%, FEV1 50%)
- BPH
- constipation


Social History:
He is married. He is a retired engineer, having worked in the
Polaroid Corporation till [**2146**]. He quit smoking many years ago
after very limited pack year usage. He rarely drinks alcohol,
does not use nutritional or herbal supplementation. There is
limited amount of caffeine intake.

Family History:
Regarding myotonic dystrophy, per records:
? Father
? First cousin on father's side undergoing work-up at [**Hospital1 1012**]-[**Location (un) 9895**]
? Two brothers, now deceased
? One of his cousins' sons, approximately 50 years old,
undergoing work-up in the [**State 9896**]. area.

Pertinent Results:
CTA Chest on [**2157-3-13**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Tree-and-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance of the right bronchi and pulmonary
system, combined with enlarged right hilar lymph nodes and
granuloma, is suspicious for an atypical infection. TB is not
excluded given the pulmonary granuloma as evidence of prior
granulomatous exposure.
3. Chronic pancreatitis.

Echocardiogram on [**2157-3-14**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2156-1-13**], no change.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 70M with myotonic dystrophy who presents with hypoxia
and recent history of bronchitis.
.
#) hypoxic respiratory failure - DDx includes respiratory muscle
failure, aspiration, congestive heart failure, PE. Most likely
this is mucous plugging due to neuromuscular weakness resulting
in inability to clear mucous.  LVEF 55% with some impaired
relaxation. Hypoxia improved with InExsufflator. Occasional
desaturation into mid 80's after ambulation but recovers well.
Stable at night with BiPap.  Per recommendations of primary
neurologist, continued with InExsufflator QID and rest on BiPAP
for 1 hour every 3 hours during the day, and all night while
patient is sleeping.  Continued with PRN nebulizers.  Continue
with empiric levofloxacin, to complete 7-day course on [**2157-3-20**].
Viral cultures positive for parainfluenza. Sputum cultures are
contaminated and urinary legionella antigen is negative.  CTA is
negative for PE. 2 days prior to DC patient did not require 02
or BIPAP during the day, ambulating with sats at 98% on RA.
Likely viral process, parainfluenza leading to bronchitis in
patient with MS leading to respiratory failure.

#) Elevated CK-and troponins, MB - possible enzyme leak vs
baseline from myotonic dystrophy.  Cardiac enzymes elevated due
to demand, no symptoms or ECG changes.  Continued aspirin, and
low dose beta blocker (patient not on this as outpatient and
became bradycardic at night on 25mg [**Hospital1 **]).
.
#) myotonic dystrophy type II - Diagnosed with genetic test in
[**2152**]. Can cause proximal muscle weakness, respiratory failure,
cardiac abnormalities, swallowing difficulty.  Supportive
treatment.  InExsufflator had improved clinical picture.
Speech/swallow eval for recurrent aspiration. As per neuro,
unclear whether respiratory state related to bronchitis picture
vs progression of disease, likely mixed picture.
.
#) elevated blood sugar - Continue with insulin sliding scale
.
#) Constipation - continue agressive senna and enemas as needed.
Patient having bowel movements with soft, non tender abdomen
throughout admission, though bowel habits a large concern for
the patient daily.
