History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 75 year old male with sudden onset severe

Pertinent Results:
Head CT IMPRESSION: [**2140-7-30**]

Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly in the bilateral
temporal
regions with blood noted in the fourth ventricle, not
significantly changed in extent compared to the prior study.
Stable ventricular size.

CTA HEAD IMPRESSION: [**2140-7-30**]

1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage.

2. Blood in the fourth ventricle. It is not clear whether
prominence of the third and lateral ventricles is acute or
chronic, i.e. related to cerebral atrophy.

3. 2.5 mm broad-necked aneurysm of the basilar artery tip. 2-mm
aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery with a relatively
[**Name2 (NI) 15015**] neck. The patient has been taken for a conventional
cerebral angiogram at the time of this dictation.

4. Apparent mild focal narrowing at the origin of the A2 segment
of the left anterior cerebral artery.

5. Cervical internal carotid atherosclerosis without evidence of
hemodynamically significant stenoses.

Radiology Report MRA CERVICAL/THORACIC SPINE Study Date of
[**2140-7-31**] 9:01 AM IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic and
cervical
spine as detailed above. 2. Prominent vessel in the midline
upper lower thoracic spine which may represent a prominent
vein/increased vascularity related to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Spinal angiography is more sensitive to evaluate for pial AVM
and is recommended if of clinical concern.

Radiology Report [**Numeric Identifier 75057**] VERT/CAROTID A-GRAM Study Date of
[**2140-7-31**] 10:33 AM
IMPRESSION: [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname 1683**] presented with a diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Two small lesions were found, and extensive
evaluation was also done of the cervical spinal canal since
there was significant subarachnoid blood in that region. There
was no evidence of spinal AV fistula. Based on this bleeding
pattern, we will also get an MRI of his cervical spine and
thoracic spine prior to deciding on surgical approach to these
aneurysms.

Radiology Report [**Numeric Identifier 83116**] CAROTID/CEREBRAL UNILAT Study Date of
[**2140-8-1**] 8:54 AM FINDINGS: Left internal carotid artery
arteriogram shows a 2 mm infundibulum of the left posterior
communicating artery origin and a 2.4 mm aneurysm with a [**Date Range 15015**]
neck of the anterior communicating segment. Post-coiling, there
is very faint filling of the left anterior communicating artery
aneurysm at the base.
IMPRESSION: [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname 1683**] underwent cerebral arteriography and
coiling of a 2.4 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm,
which was uneventful.

Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2140-7-31**]
2:49 PM
IMPRESSION: 1. New small foci of subarachnoid blood in the
paramedian bifrontal sulci. Otherwise, extensive diffuse
subarachnoid hemorrhage is unchanged. 2. Blood is now present
not only in the fourth ventricle, but also in the occipital
horns of the lateral ventricles, possibly due to redistribution.
Stable ventricular size.

PM CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT BRAIN PERFUSION
IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis.
2. No evidence of residual lumen of aneurysm; however, due to
coil artifact, cannot exclude tiny residual lumen.

Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2140-8-7**]
10:54 AM
IMPRESSION: Status post coiling of the ACA, with only minimal
residual
subarachnoid foci. No new hydrocephalus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted for SAH and brought to angiogram where he was found
to have an Acom Aneurysm which was not coiled at that time. He
then returned on [**8-1**] where he had coiling done and sent to ICU
for close monitoring.

Patient remained stable, with no changes in his mental status
and was transferred  out to the Step down unit on [**8-3**].

On [**8-4**] late in the afternoon when the patient's wife was
visiting she notic
