Admission Date:  [**2122-2-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2122-3-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2076-1-19**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 46-year-old female postpartum
dilated cardiomyopathy who presented with shortness of breath
and chest pain in the context of not taking Bumex for several
days.  The patient apparently had branch of brandname of
Bumex, and was unwilling to take generic Bumex.  Therefore,
did not take the medication for at least five days.

She complains of some malaise, fatigue.  On further
questioning, it appears that she has not been taking her ACE
inhibitor because she is also worried that generic ACE
inhibitor is bad for her heart.  At baseline, she has Class
II Heart congestive heart failure, able to do activities of
daily living and climb one flight of stairs.  Over the last
few days, however, she noticed a worsening dyspnea on
exertion, inability to walk more than 10 feet, and this
morning, she had chest pain, diaphoresis, and shortness of
breath.  She has no lower extremity edema.

In the Emergency Department, she had a systolic blood
pressure of 90 and was attempted diuresis, which actually
worsened the blood pressure to 70.  She was started on
dobutamine drip, pulse IV fluids, and transferred to CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Postpartum dilated cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of
15% with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 40.
Catheterization in [**2115**] reveals normal coronary arteries.
2. Diabetes mellitus.
3. Chronic renal failure with creatinine at baseline of about
2.
4. Hepatitis B.
5. Hepatitis C.
6. Increased cholesterol.
7. Chest pain cholecystectomy.
8. Gout.
9. Asthma.

ALLERGIES:  The patient claims to be allergic to all sorts of
generic medications.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Enalapril 10 q day.
2. Digoxin 0.125 q day.
3. Avandia 4 q day.
4. Bumex 4 tid.
5. Albuterol inhaler.
6. Flovent inhaler.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives in a two-level home.  Former
cocaine user.  Has not used any cocaine for the last 10
years.  No tobacco, alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 90/40, pulse 100,
respiratory rate 30, and sating 96 on nasal cannula.
General:  Anxious female in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Anicteric.  Equal and reactive pupils.  Neck is supple,
jugular venous distention about 10 cm.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, obese,
nondistended, and nontender.  Cardiovascular:  Distant heart
sounds, no murmurs.  Extremities:  No pitting edema.
Neurologic examination is generally unremarkable.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count is 3.9, hematocrit is
32.3, platelets 166.  Chem-7 is significant for a creatinine
of 2.2.  Initial subsequent CKs were normal.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:  Presentation is most consistent with
recent noncompliance with medication, volume overload, and
now worsening of the congestive heart failure.  A Swan-Ganz
catheter was placed which revealed markedly elevated
pulmonary artery and wedge pressures consistent with volume
overload.  She was started on aggressive diuresis with IV
Bumex with significant results.  A question of a pulmonary
embolus was raised given continuing sinus tachycardia.

Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain examination given
patient's chronic renal failure in addition to her apparent
reaction to shellfish.  We plan to obtain a MRA of the
pulmonary artery to confirm pulmonary embolus, but after
significant delay following malfunctioning of the magnet, the
patient was unable to fit into the machine secondary to body
habitus.  At that point, she has already been experiencing
significant improvement and had no further episodes of
shortness of breath or chest pain.

It should be noted that after the first several days, and
after she had diuresed a significant amount of fluid, her
chest pain and shortness of breath in particular resolved.
She was able to breathe comfortably on room air with no
significant distress.

In the context of her acute management, all of her outpatient
medications such as ACE inhibitor and beta blocker are being
withheld, she is continued on her digoxin.  After about seven
days of close monitoring, the patient achieved an euvolemic
state and was slowly started on her ACE inhibitor and beta
blocker, which are currently at a much lower dose in the
past.

2. Pulmonary.  Patient continued on her inhalers for a
history of asthma.  It is highly unlikely that she had a
pulmonary embolus as her condition clinically improved with
improvement of her volume overload.

3. Renal.  Baseline creatinine is 2.0-2.3 range.  With
improvement of her forward flow and improved kidney
perfusion, the creatinine improved to about 1.6-1.7, which is
low at time of discharge.  This can be expected to come up a
little bit with reinstitution of ACE inhibitor.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

1. Lipitor 10 q day.
2. Digoxin 0.125 q day.

4. Lisinopril 2.5 q day.
5. Bumex 2 mg po bid.
6. Avandia 4 mg po q day.
