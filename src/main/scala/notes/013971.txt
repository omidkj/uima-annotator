worsening lower extremity edema

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 45yo female with HCV cirrhosis, R-sided CHF p/w increasing
bilateral [**Location (un) **], DOE. Recent admit [**Date range (1) 51555**] ([**Doctor Last Name 22583**] [**Location (un) **]). This
admission was for hypotension and lightheadedness. She had a
short stay in the MICU however etiology of hypotension was
unclear, however felt most likely secondary to right sided HF
and possible hypovolemia. However unfortuantely with hydration
she experienced worsening edema for which she got diuretics.
Also had episode of confusion during her stay which was
ultimately found to be caused by a UTI which was treated with
levofloxacin. She was discharged last Thursday with plans for
close follow up with [**Hospital **] clinic. Over the past week the patient
states she has been taking her meds as prescribed however her LE
edema continued to worsen. However she does state that her
weight has not changed from discharge at 264 pounds. Along with
worsening edema she noted onset of SOB this AM. She denies any
chest pain, N/V, diaphoresis, palpitations. No recent fevers,
chills. Denies any sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] she has been following
low sodium diet and watching her fluid intake.

mmHg.

5. RHF - Echo in 7/[**2161**]. EF>55%, Global right ventricular
hypokinesis.

Abdominal US:  The liver parenchyma is relatively unremarkable.
The portal vein is patent but has reversed (centrifugal flow).
No evidence of thrombus within the portal vein. The main hepatic
artery is visualized. Left branch of the portal vein is also
patent. The splenic vein and splenomesenteric confluence appears
patent.
   There is no evidence of significant ascites. Some
subcutaneous edema and induration is identified, but no clearly
identified fluid collection.


Brief Hospital Course:
45 yo woman w/ h/o HCV cirrhosis, right sided HF, recently d/c
after treatment of orthostatic hypotension, now a/w  worsening
LE edema and cough.

1. Cor pulmonale:  she has severe right sided heart failure [**3-17**]
pulm HTN, which is responsible for her complaints of peripheral
edema.  This has been difficult to control given her concurrent
cirrhosis w/ low albumin.  Aggressive diuresis depletes
intravascular volume and deprives RV of high filling volumes
that are needed to maintain cardiac output.  There is no
evidence of ACS by EKG and cardiac enzymes.  We transitioned her
to PO lasix with success. Her fluid status is very tenuous
therefore if her weight increases, he Lasix may need to be
increased.

2. Pulm HTN:  this is likely [**3-17**] portopulmonary HTN.  It was
unresponsive to NO2 during cath.  There are few remaining
options for treatment in this pt. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted for
this patient and it was determined that there were no other
therapies with would change this patient's poor prognosis.

3. HCV cirrhosis:  She has cirrhosis from HCV and h/o etoh
abuse. She denies any recent ETOH.  LFTs have been stable for
months though her synthetic function is comprimised.  RUQ
doppler US shows no evidence of ascites or portal thrombosis.
The patient intermittenly becomes encheplpathic and this usually
correlates with her refusal of lactulose. She will continue the
lactulose TID for [**2-14**] BM q day.

4. Coagulopathy: [**3-17**] cirrhosis w/ thrombocytopenia.  No evidence
of bleeding though she has had a recent GIB. She should be
transfused for platelets less than 50.

5. Asthma: well controlled w/ advair and albuterol; Continue
current regimin.

6. DM: Her DM was controlled with NPH and regular insulin SS.

7. Anemia: She has h/o hemolytic anemia on last admission in
setting of mycoplasma IgM, now s/p course of levaquin.  HCT
remained low on admission.  No evidence of active bleeding.  She
was transfused 2 units PRBCs during this admission. Her HCT was
stable following this. Her hemolytic workup was negative. This
workup can be continued as an outpatient.

8. Mental Status: The patient has had changes in her mental
status before and during this admission, she had several days
where her mental status was altered. This was very difficult to
assess because even when she was felt to be cleared, she would
continually incoorperative with interviews and exams. When she
was altered, she would responed to questions with often correct
answers, but repeat her answers many times, even after the team
had left the room. These episodes corresponded to times when the
paitent would refuse her lactulose and she would improve with
more lactulose. It was felt to be caused by hepatic
encalholpaty. Though it is very difficult for the patient to
have multiple BM/day, she will need to continue lactulose daily.
Given her diagnoses, her mental status will likely deterioate.

9. Trichomonas infection: The pateitn was found to have
occasinnal trichonomas on a routine UA. She was asked about
sexual contacts but would not coorperate with interviews. She
refused a pelvic exam. She was treated with Flagyl 500 PO BID fo
2 days and will continue this fo 5 days as an outpatient. She
should have a pelvic exam as an outpatient for GC and chalmyidia
screens and preventative health care.

10. Care Plan: The team had multiple discussion with the patient
and her family about her poor prognosis. The patient was not
receptive to the conversations and often said she did not want
to think of these topics and directed us to talk with her
mother. The mother, brother, and sister-in-law are very involved
and understand the patient's prognosis. It was agreed that the
patietn could not take care of herself at home and discharged to
a rehab. The paitnet has not designated a health care proxy and
she does not want to discuss her code status on multiple
attments by the team.
