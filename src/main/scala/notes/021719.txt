Service:  Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old
male who presented in [**2102-10-21**] with adenocarcinoma of
the distal stomach.  On [**2103-1-10**], the patient
underwent a distal gastrectomy with a Roux-en-y
reconstruction.  The patient was discharged to a
rehabilitation facility but returned to an outside hospital
with severe diarrhea and severe metabolic acidosis.  He was
re-explored on [**2103-2-17**].  Exploration was negative for
intra-abdominal pathology and jejunostomy tube was placed at
that operation.

The patient's postoperative course was complicated by a
myocardial infarction with a troponin peak of 17.  On
postoperative day number three, the patient was noted to have
an increasing volume requirement and an increasing white
blood cell count.  A couple of days later, he developed
bilious drainage from the inferior pole of his wound.  The
patient was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] for management of his enterocutaneous fistula.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Status post distal gastrectomy and
Roux-en-Y on [**2103-1-10**].  2.  Status post right
carotid endarterectomy.  3.  Status post right
cerebrovascular accident with left hemiparesis.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and hydrochlorothiazide.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor, vancomycin, gentamicin,
Flagyl, Protonix, fluconazole and morphine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was mildly febrile to 100.1 with a heart rate of 100, blood
pressure 90/50 and oxygen saturation 99%.  The patient was
intubated but alert with coarse breath sounds anteriorly.
His heart rate was regular but tachycardiac and he had
diffuse tenderness with positive bowel sounds but no
guarding.  He had a midline incision with copious bilious
drainage from the inferior pole.  The patient also had a
jejunostomy tube on the right side.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was
26,000.  Liver function tests were within normal limits.
Chemistries were unremarkable except for a creatinine of 1.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the surgical
service, placed on broad spectrum antibiotics and started on
total parenteral nutrition.  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course
for the next week consisted mainly of percutaneous drainage
of three fluid collections, one on the right side, on the
liver was percutaneously drained at the outside hospital and
this drain continued to drain bilious material.  Another
fluid collection in the left upper quadrant was also
percutaneously drained by interventional radiation.  This
drain drained serosanguinous fluid.  A left lower quadrant
fluid collection was also percutaneously tapped but this was
only aspirated as it only had serous material.  The lower
pole of the patient's incision, which continued to drain
bile, was easily controlled with a whistle tip catheter,
which was placed to suction.

The patient's white blood cell count decreased to 9.9 and,
once he was felt to be reasonably stable, he underwent a
fistulogram to try to characterize the fistula.  Fistulas
were not characterized and we decided to take him to the
Operating Room on [**2103-3-6**] for exploration and attempt
at surgical control of the fistulas.

The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, enterectomy
revision of his gastrojejunostomy and closure of a colotomy
on [**2103-3-6**].  The patient was stable in the
intraoperative period but, in the postoperative period,
developed frequent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation with an
unstable blood pressure.  The patient had been on 18 of PEEP
and FiO2 of 60% preoperatively and continued to be on those
setting postoperatively.

During the next couple of days, the patient developed an
increasing volume requirement, increased acidosis and
subsequently became progressively hypotensive, requiring
escalating doses of pressors.  The source of the patient's
sepsis was felt to be intra-abdominal.

The patient's acidosis worsened, his pH dropping to 7 and he
became refractory to pressors.  At that point, it was decided
that the patient would not survive and support was withdrawn.
The patient expired 14 minutes after stopping pressors, on
[**2103-3-8**] at 4:50 p.m.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Enterocutaneous fistula, status post exploratory
laparotomy with closure of colotomy and revision of
gastrojejunostomy and enteric resection
2.  Multi-system organ failure and septic shock.
3.  Status post distal gastric resection for adenocarcinoma
of the stomach with Roux-en-Y reconstruction.
4.  Status post right carotid endarterectomy.
5.  Status post right cerebrovascular accident.
