Service:  [**Location (un) 259**] MEDICINE

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
female with a complicated past history who was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital from [**2107-11-10**] to [**2107-11-19**]
for symptoms of right neck mass/dysphagia of two weeks and
was found to have a large right internal jugular clot with
questionable extension to the right atrium by the outside
hospital echocardiogram.  The patient was treated with
antibiotics for presumed septic thrombophlebitis and has had
an extensive hypercoagulable workup done which was all normal
with the exception of slightly elevated homocystine at 16.1.

The patient was subsequently discharged home on Lovenox as a
bridge to Coumadin on [**2107-11-19**] and the following day reported
feeling nauseated, complained of chest pain, palpitations,
weakness and shortness of breath.  This was followed by a
syncopal episode.  The patient was taken back to [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital and then was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation.  The patient felt
better in the Emergency Department but was still slightly
nauseated.

The patient was subsequently admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for observation. She had a repeat CT of
the neck showing a right internal jugular clot.  There was no
right atrial clot on echocardiogram.  The patient also had a
chest CT which showed hilar lymphadenopathy.  No PE.  The
patient also had a negative CT.

The patient presented with an INR of 7.7 and the same day at
the outside hospital was 10.1.  Of note, the patient was
discharged with an INR of 2 from the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on the
previous hospitalization.  The patient was also noted to have
platelets of 70, had a normal fibrinogen and nonspecific T
wave inversions in leads II, III, and aVF as well as V5 and
V6.  The patient was subsequently transferred to the regular
medicine floor for further workup/observation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.9, pulse 62-76, blood pressure 96-130s/40s-90s,
respirations 18-24, 96% on room air.  General:  The patient
was a pleasant female, sitting up in a chair in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles were intact.
Moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  Positive asymmetry,
specifically right neck swelling which is not mobile.

murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No clubbing,

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 19.1, hematocrit
31.1, platelets 82,000.  INR 7.7 on admission.  Fibrinogen
585.  D-dimer 1,443.  Chemistries:  Sodium 136, potassium
3.8, chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, BUN 14, creatinine 0.9,
glucose 93.  Troponin 0.93, CK 48, MB fraction not done.  ALT
41, AST 33, alkaline phosphatase 101, LDH 478, lipase 32,
total bilirubin 0.2, lactate 101.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  The
patient's heparin-dependent antibodies came back positive.
Her Coumadin and Lovenox were held with a subsequent
normalization of her platelet count and INR.
Hematology/Oncology Service was consulted and they felt that
since the platelet count did return back to normal it was
safe to restart Coumadin.  Her Coumadin was restarted once
her INR reached 3.2 at a reduced dose of 2 mg and further was
decreased to 1 mg.  The INR was 3.5 the day of discharge.
During her admission, it was noted that her right IJ clot
improved dramatically.  She was off of antibiotics throughout
the hospital stay and showed no signs of infection.

The etiology of isolated right IJ clot is still somewhat
unclear.  The above workup has been performed.  We were
concerned about hilar adenopathy that was found on her chest
CT.  It was recommended that the patient was to undergo
outpatient bronchoscopy and biopsy for a malignancy workup.
This appointment was scheduled for the patient.  The patient
was set up at an [**Hospital3 **] at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital
and was instructed to have her INR checked within two days
after discharge.

2.  EOSINOPHILIA:  Apparently, the patient had a problem with
eosinophilia for quite some time now and had a prior workup
done by hematologist at the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.  The etiology
of eosinophilia is unclear with the differential diagnosis
including malignancy, parasite versus allergy versus
connective tissue disease.  The patient would need her CBC
and differential checked after this acute hospitalization is
resolved and if not resolved would benefit from an outpatient
bone marrow biopsy to rule out hypereosinophilic syndrome.

3.  NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  The patient was
found to have a troponin of 0.9 on admission.  The patient's
EKG changes were nonspecific, not pointing to any specific
vasculatory.  The patient was continued on aspirin, Plavix,
and beta blocker and underwent a stress MIBI which showed no
perfusion defect and ejection fraction of 78% with normal
wall motion.

4.  SYNCOPE:  Questionable vasovagal versus primary
neurologic versus cardiac.  The above workup was done.  There
was no evidence of cardiomyopathy or new valvular heart
disease or new wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram.
The patient was seen by the inpatient Cardiology Service who
felt that the patient could have had a pulmonary embolus not
picked up by a CTA.  The patient has not had any similar
episodes and continued on anticoagulation.  The patient's
stress echocardiogram does not show any evidence of RV
dysfunction or any other worrisome findings.  The patient is
to be continued on anticoagulation while being worked up for
possible malignancy causing this hypercoagulable syndrome.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Right internal jugular thrombus.
2.  Syncope.
3.  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
4.  Eosinophilia.
5.  Presumed pulmonary embolus.
6.  Elevated troponin.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Atorvostatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Alendronate 70 mg p.o. q. Monday.
7.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Coumadin 1 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient was given a script for an
outpatient laboratory work for INR and CBC check on [**2107-11-30**]
and the results were to be sent to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient's
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient is also to follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within the next two days after hospitalization.
The patient is to follow-up with Pulmonology Clinic for an
outpatient bronchoscopy.  Interventional Pulmonology office
is to contact the patient with the date of the appointment.
The patient is also to see her hematologist within the next
few weeks for the evaluation of eosinophilia.
