History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN,
HLD, DM type 2, PVD who presents with 2 weeks of worsening SOB
and a productive cough. She also report orthopnea X 4 pillows
and PND new over the past two weeks. The night prior to her
admission she had to sit up in bed all night, could not sleep
and had trouble catching her breath. She denies weight gain,
peripheral swelling or woresening nocturia. She reports
exertional dyspnea from baseline of 2 blocks and 20 steps two
weeks ago to dyspnea at rest. Pt denies fever or chills. No URT
symptoms. No recent febrile illness.  No recent travels, no

imobility. She had Flu vaccine 11/[**2151**]. She is a heavy active
smoker with known COPD and has history of admission with
pneumonia, intubation and MV one year ago. She does not use
chronic steroids or inhalers and is not on home oxygen. She saw
her PCP for above complaints on [**1-5**] who prescribed Atrovent
inhaler. She had a CXR which was reportedly unremarkable and did
not recieve antibiotics recently.

Pertinent Results:
Laboratories: Notable for ABG 7.38/42/63/HCO3 = 23. No
leukocytosis. Normocytic anemia Hct 34.8 unchanged from
baseline. Cr/BUN 0.8/33. trop = 0.02. Lactate = 1.0.  .
ECG:  Sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, axis wnl, normal intervals, no
evidence of ischemia, LVH or myocardial strain.
.
Imaging:
CXR [**1-19**]- FINDINGS: Perihilar left upper lobe opacity is still
present on the current study suggestive of persistent
consolidation and/or mass. Atelectasis versus consolidation at
the left base is new since the prior study. There is persistent
evidence of right middle lobe collapse. The heart and
mediastinal contours are normal. No effusion or pneumothorax is
present. IMPRESSION: Persistent left upper lobe opacity. Patient
should have a chest CT after possible sources of infection have
been treated to rule out underlying mass.
.
[**1-18**]
FINDINGS:
Compared to the prior radiograph from [**2152-1-27**], the
right middle lobe collapse has slightly increased. There is
unchanged opacity in the left upper lobe in perihilar region,
persistent since the CT from [**2152-1-16**].
Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal. There is no
pleural effusion, and no pneumothorax.   On the lateral view, an
linear opacity is seen, consistent with atelectasis/collapse
along a major fissure.
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite pneumonia, atelectasis/collapse in portions of
the lung seen on lateral view.
2. Ill-defined opacity in the left upper lobe (persistent since
the CT and
radiographs from [**2151-12-17**]); recommend further workup with
dedicated chest CT to rule out underlying mass.
.
Historical studies:
CT scan [**2152-1-16**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Left hilar fullness with vague suggestion of hilar adenopathy
or mass.  Associated left upper lobe consolidation may reflect
post-obstructive pneumonia.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, with associated
atelectasis
of the adjacent lung.
4. Scattered peribronchiolar nodular opacities in the right
upper
and right lower lobes, may be infectious or inflammatory.
5. Bilateral pulmonary nodules as detailed, comparison to prior
studies suggested.

Echocardiography [**12/2151**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal basal inferior hypokinesis, where the myocardium is also
slightly thinned. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF
= 50-55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w prior inferior infarction.
