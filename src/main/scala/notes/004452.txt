Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Chief complaint was increased swelling,
change in mental status, and acute renal failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old
woman with congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 20%, atrial fibrillation, and anasarca who presented with
acute renal failure, mental status changes, and swelling in
the extremities.

The patient is on a chronic diuresis for her anasarca.  On
[**2173-6-21**], her creatinine was noted to be 1.7 and had
progressively increased to 4 on [**2173-6-30**].  During this
period, the patient did not have a Foley catheter in place,
raising the possibility of urinary retention.  The change in
mental status was reported by her primary care physician
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], but when the patient herself denied feeling
confused.  The patient denied chest pain.  The patient admits
to shortness of breath which was no different from her
baseline.  She normally sits upright in bed at all times,
even at night when she sleeps.  The patient denies fever,
cough, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, or
abdominal pain.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On physical
examination, temperature was 96.3, pulse was 80, blood
pressure was 89/59, respiratory rate was 25, oxygen
saturation was 94% on 2 liters.  In general, the patient was
an obese elderly Caucasian female in no acute distress;
slightly tachypneic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
The fundi were unremarkable.  Mucous membranes were slightly
dry.  The oropharynx was benign.  The neck revealed no
cervical lymphadenopathy. Jugular venous distention about
12 cm.  No thyromegaly.  No carotid bruits bilaterally.
Heart was irregularly irregular rhythm.  First heart sound
and second heart sound were normal.  Distant heart sounds.
Lungs revealed bibasilar rales in the lower half of the
lungs.  No wheezes or rhonchi.  Gastrointestinal revealed
positive bowel sounds, soft, and obese.  No masses.
Extremities revealed left above-knee amputation, 2+ edema
bilaterally in the lower extremities.  The patient had a
3-cm X 3-cm ulcer on the anterior aspect of the distal right
lower extremity.  There was also a 2-cm X 2-cm on the medial
aspect of the distal right lower extremity; this ulcer had a
clean base, not erythematous, with no discharge or pus.  The
patient also had an ulcer on the left buttocks and the right
thigh.  Neurologically, alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  No gross loss of
tactile sensation.  Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout.
Dermatologic examination revealed decreased skin turgor.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed a white blood cell count of 10.1, hematocrit
was 25.3, platelets were 100.  Differential revealed
75 polys, 3 lymphocytes, and 10 bands.  Sodium was 137,
potassium was 4.7, chloride was 95, bicarbonate was 33, blood
urea nitrogen was 56, creatinine was 4.1, blood glucose
was 124.  Arterial blood gas revealed pH of 7.43, PCO2 of 59,
PO2 of 76.  Urinalysis was negative except for large blood
and trace leukocyte.  Microbiology urinalysis showed red
blood cells of greater than 50, white blood cells equaled 3.
Negative for eosinophils.  Urine sodium was 57.  Urine
creatinine was 72.  FENa was approximately 2.2%.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray showed increased density
in the left cardiac region; could represent atelectasis,
effusion, or pneumonia.  There was increased pulmonary
bilaterally hilar opacity; represent pulmonary edema.

Electrocardiogram was unchanged from previous
electrocardiogram.  There was atrial fibrillation with a
heart rate of 121 beats per minute, QRS interval of 164.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 86-year-old female with a past
medical history of congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 20%, atrial fibrillation, and anasarca who
presented with worsening congestive heart failure and acute
renal failure.

The most likely cause of her acute renal failure was prerenal
based on her physical examination and laboratories.  Also,
secondary to over-aggressive diuresis with Lasix and
decompensated congestive heart failure.  On the morning of
[**2173-7-2**] at 4 a.m., the patient had hypotension with a
blood pressure of 60/30 with decreased oxygen saturations to
below 70% on 7 liters.  With mask oxygenation, the patient's
vital signs were back to normal range.  Blood pressure was up
to 85/43 and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient went on to have a similar episode of hypotension.
At this time, the medical team agreed to send the patient to
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was treated
with dobutamine, dopamine, an intravenous fluids; but the
patient showed little improvement in terms of oxygenation and
bilateral maintenance.

After a long discussion with the patient's primary care
doctor, and also her attending doctor, and the family members
including her daughters and grandsons we decided to send her
back to the floor for comfort measures on [**2173-7-4**].

It was a very difficult decision to make the patient do not
resuscitate/do not intubate with the primary goal of comfort,
but the family of the patient and the medical team also
agreed that this was the appropriate step to take.

When the patient was transferred back to the floor on
[**2173-7-4**], she was kept on comfort measures which
included only morphine intravenously and oxygenation through
nasal cannula to keep the patient comfortable.  It was a very
difficult to make the patient do not resuscitate/do not
intubate the patient without monitoring except for morphine
and oxygenation.

The patient passed away two days later, on the morning of
[**2173-7-6**].  The family members and the attending were
notified at 2:30 a.m.   Our grievance and sympathy go out to
the [**Known lastname **] family.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:   The patient had decompensated
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%
with reduced forward flow and pulmonary edema as evidenced by
a chest x-ray and fistulogram.

On the second day of hospitalization, the patient developed a
dry cough but was afebrile.  The cough was likely due to
pulmonary edema.  Reduced afterload was limited due to a
history of hypotension.  Anatrophic agents such as digoxin
did not help her in the past, according to her primary care
doctor.  Diuresis is limited due to acute renal failure.

Therefore, very minimal intravenous fluids were used
throughout the hospital stay, and Lasix was withheld due to
the acute renal failure.

2.  RENAL:  The patient acute renal failure with a creat
