[**2104-10-28**] CXR:


Brief Hospital Course:
After presenting to the ER 0n [**2104-10-28**], Mr. [**Known lastname 3950**] was
intubated for airway protection. A CXR demonstrated infiltrate
in LLL and his INR was found to be supratherapeutic at 3.9. Mr.
[**Known lastname 3950**] was then evaluated in the ER by interventional
pulmonology, who performed flexible bronchoscopy for his
hemoptysis. The bronchoscopy revealed no active bleeding. He was
found to have evidence of old bleeding in superior segment of
the left lower lobe and friable airways throughout. No
endobronchial lesions were noted.

His coumadin was held and he received fresh frozen plasma to
correct his coagulopathy. His repeat INR came back at 2.0. He
was admitted to the CVICU and put on a ventilator. He remained
stable overnight. On hospital day 2, he was extubated in the
morning without complications. He remained stable throughout the
day. That evening, he was transferred out of the CVICU to the
floor, where he immediately developed shortness of breath and
began coughing up a small volume of blood-tinged sputum. He
maintained his saturations in the mid-90's on 4LNC and 40%FM. He
was triggered for marked nursing concern and was then
transferred to the CVICU, where after receiving IV Lasix and
morphine, he became considerably more comfortable. He had an
uneventful night.

On hospital day 3, a palliative care consult was obtained and it
was determined that the patient wished not to pursue aggressive
care any longer and wanted to be discharged home with hospice
services. A referral was made to hospice. He was provided with
liquid morphine for comfort. That evening, his care was
transferred to the Cardiac service. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was placed on a
lasix drip and was diuresed as he has been volume overloaded.
Additionally, He refused oral medications except for morphine.
On hospital day 4, he was discharged home with hospice.  Patient
has chosen to not be rehospitalized.

Regarding code status, according to the patient's wishes and in
consultation with his son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Hospital 3951**] health care proxy, he
was made DNR/DNI. The DNI order was temporarily rescinded while
the patient was intubated for less than 24 hours, but was then
put back into effect after extubation. At the time of discharge,
his code status remained DNR/DNI.
