This is a discharge summary dating from [**2198-7-24**].  The
patient is now a 23-day old former 37-1/7 weeks infant with
complex congenital heart disease, who is now ready for
discharge home. Her initial hospital stay was complicated by
a conotruncal VSD with subsequent development of CHF, double
aortic arch, respiratory distress,
persistent pulmonary hypertension and presumed infection.
She was on CPAP for the first 3 days of life then required
mechanical ventilation and surfactant therapy for the next two
days. She weaned to Room Air on [**2198-7-17**].

NICU COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory status.  She has
remained in room air since day of life number eight.  She has
baseline mild subcostal retractions.  Lung sounds are clear
and equal.

Cardiovascular.  The patient's last echocardiogram on
[**2198-7-25**] showed a large membranous ventricular septal defect
with left to right shunting, qualitatively good biventricular
function, subvalvular pulmonary stenosis, left pulmonary
artery stenosis, and arterial vessels that arises from the
area of the descending aorta and courses superiorly, which
may be an aberrant subclavian, previously called a double
aortic arch.  She is being treated with digoxin, Lasix, and
Aldactone for this.  On examination, she has a grade [**1-27**]
holosystolic harsh murmur.  Her liver at baseline is 1 cm
below the right costal margin.

She is being followed at [**Hospital3 1810**] Cardiology
Department, attending, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Cardiology fellow,
[**Doctor Last Name **] Rajagopal ([**Hospital3 1810**] beeper number [**Pager number **]).

Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition status:  At the time of
discharge, the weight is 3,255 grams, length 52.5 cm, and
head circumference 36.25 cm.  At the time of discharge, the
patient is eating breast milk fortified to 30 calories/ounce
and taking approximately 150 mL/kg/day.  This was made with 6
calories/ounce of Similac powder and 4 calories/ounce of corn
oil.  The mother is pumping and currently has enough milk to
meet the patient's demand.  She desires to breast feed if the
patient's weight gain is consistent enough even if it were to
nurse only once or twice a day.  She has been given the name
of several lactation consultants to help with maintaining
milk supply and breast feeding after discharge.  The patient
was evaluated by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital3 1810**]
feeding team (beeper number [**Pager number **]) on [**2198-7-19**] for oral feeding
difficulties.  The patient's oral intake improved and there
is no followup needed.  Electrolytes done on [**2198-8-1**] on the
day prior to discharge show Na 137, K 5.5, Cl 93, HCO# 31.

Hematology.  The patient received one transfusion of packed
red blood cells on [**2198-7-26**].  Her hematocrit on [**2198-8-1**] is
43.3.  She was blood type A positive.

Infectious disease.  AT the time of admission the patient was
treated with a 7 day course of Ampicillin and Cefotaxime for
presumed infection. A blood culture remained negative. CSF was
attempted unsuccessfully. The patient was started on
Vancomycin
and cefotaxime on [**2198-7-26**] for clinical presentation of
sepsis.  The antibiotics were discontinued after 48 hours and
the infant was clinically well and the blood cultures were
negative.  She has received no antibiotics since that time.
She is being treated for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 564**] diaper rash with nystatin
ointment.  That treatment was begun on [**2198-7-18**].
