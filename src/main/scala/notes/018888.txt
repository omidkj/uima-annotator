Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
intraarterial tPA with Merci procedure and Penumbra device
Left frontal tooth extration ([**2170-9-24**])
PEG tube placement ([**2170-10-3**])


History of Present Illness:
66 y/o M with hx of CAD s/p CABG in [**2160**], DM, CHF, HTN, and PVD
presents with approximately a week long history of intermittent
chest pain. The pain would come on consistently after dinner and
be substernal and feel like burning. He would then get a "funny"
feeling down the lateral aspects of his arms and also start to
have some tingling in his gums. The pain would last for approx
40 minutes and then go away. He tried both tums and nitro and
got no relief.
.
On [**8-31**] he presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with these complaints and was
ruled out by EKGs and enzymes. He was worked up for atypical
chest pain. A CT of chest without contrast was negative. He was
started on prednisone for inflammation and doxycycline for
possible lymes disease (sounds like he had a positive culture).
He was discharged to home when two days ago he had the pain
again. Substernal, radiating to arms, no diaphoresis or
shortness of breath. It was while he was driving and was now
relieved by nitro (which was different than his other episodes).
He went to bed that night and then woke up again with the pain.
It again was relieved by nitro, so he decided to return to the
hopsital. He had positive Troponin rise, negative CK, and
possible new EKG changes with ST depressions. He was transferred
to here at that time.
.
On ROS he does endorse six months of increasing dyspnea on
exertion, fatigue and inability to get very far without needing
to sit down. Is dizzy when standing still. Has not fallen. No
fevers or chills or changes in weight.

Total Score: 23

Physical exam upon discharge:
Patient remains with eyes closed most of the time, even when
awake. At times he is able to say isolated words and 3 to 4
words sentences to express his feelings, and at times he just
mumbles. He is able to follow simple commands such as show [**Last Name (un) **]
fingers, but he also shows perseverating. His eyes movements are
impaired to vertical gaze deviation, and barely cross midline to
left and slow to the right horizontal movements. He does not
showed any voluntary movements from left upper and lower
extremities. Right extremities are normal in tone, strenght and
reflexes. There was a time that he presented less movement at
the right lower limb, but this was resolved.

Other studies:
USG from lower extremities ([**2170-9-18**]):No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in either leg

Chest CT [**2170-9-16**]
FINDINGS: Equivocal subsegmental filling defects in pulmonary
artery branches of left lower lobe that could represent flow
artifact in this study with respiratory motion. If high clinical
suspicious of pulmonary embolism, a repeat study is recommended.
Limited evaluation of lung parenchyma due to respiratory motion
does not reveal lung nodules or consolidation. Presence of
dependent atelectasis. No pleural effusion. Nasogastric tube can
be seen in the esophagus. Heart size is within normal limits.
Coronary stents and bypass graft is noted. Atherosclerotic
calcification in the aorta. No pericardial effusion. Bilateral
hilar lymph nodes are noted.  Limited evaluation of the
abdominal organs is unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: Status post sternotomy. Degenerative changes seen
of the
thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Equivocal findings of pulmonary embolism and left
lower lobe, that could represen
