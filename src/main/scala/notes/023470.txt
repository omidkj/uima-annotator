Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted on [**10-28**] for his operation. Surgical findings
were: Extensive adhesions in the upper and lower abdomen, an 18
inch Roux limb, a 21 circular stapled
gastrojejunostomy. No leak on methylene blue checks. Post op the
patient was made NPO, had an NGT, Foley and epidural for pain.
The patient was tachycardic to 111 (pre-op was 118). His BP
decreased- had a stable HCT and the epidural was then
discontinued. A PCA was started for pain managment. On POD2 the
patient remained tachycardic and his lopressor was increased. On
POD3 the patient had an episode of desaturation to the high
80's. A CXR was obtained which shoed pulmonary edemma. Lasix was
given with good response.  The patient was also started on
nebulizer treatments. The CXR also showed evidence or a right
upper lobe pneumonia. Levofloxacin was started for a 5 day
course. On POD5 the patient became tachycardic to the 140's. A
CTA of the chest and abdomen was obtained. The results were: 1.
No evidence for pulmonary embolus.  2. Bilateral layering
pleural effusions. Hazy ground-glass opacification of the right
upper lobe is compatible with pneumonia, less likely atypical
edema or alveolar hemorrhage.  3. No evidence for a leak. Soft
tissue stranding about the stomach is compatible with patient's
recent surgery.

The patient was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring and
a CVL was placed. The patient was given more lasix and the
patient beta blocker was increased. An NGT was placed to remove
the contrast from the patient's stomach. Pulmonary medicine was
also consulted. An echo was obtained which showed an EF>55% and
no wall abnormalities. Cardiac enzymed were also cycled which
came back normal. The patient HR came under control and he
started passing gas. His NGT was d/c and his diet was advanced.
He was transferred out of the unit in stable condition.

The patient PCA was stopped, his foley discontinued and he was
switched to oral medication. A one time dose of vitamin K was
given for an INR of 1.8. The patient was advanced to a stage III
diet which he tolerated.  Overnight of [**11-7**] the pt. again
became tachycardic and was unable to void.  A foley catheter was
replaced and the central line was removed with the tip sent for
culture and the pt. was started on Vancomycin.  Blood and
catheter tip cultures from that night grew out MRSA and the
vancomycin was continued.  Urology was consulted and recommended
that the pt. be sent home with the foley and follow-up in clinic
for removal.  Leg bag teaching was initiated.  Repeat blood
cultures were drawn for the next several days - all of which
from [**11-9**] on showed no growth to date on the day of discharge.
The pt. was advanced to a Stage IV diet that he tolerated well,
was given a bowel regimen, and by POD 15 was ready for discharge
to home with VNA for dressing changes.  He was sent with
instructions regarding follow-up appointments with surgery,
urology, and his primary care physician; post-operative
medications including pain medication, beta-blockers, and flomax
that was started while in house; and post-operative care
regarding activity level, diet, and wound care.  The pt.
understood these instructions.
