Cardiology Report

ECG Study Date of [**2103-9-4**]  5:22:40 AM
Sinus rhythm. Low QRS voltage is non-specific but clinical
correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2103-6-6**] right axis
deviation and
early precordial QRS transition are absent and generalized low
QRS voltage is now seen.

Radiology Report

FOOT AP,LAT & OBL LEFT Study Date of [**2103-8-29**] 5:22 PM
FINDINGS:
Three views of the left foot demonstrate osteopenia. There is
hallux valgus metatarsus and varus with mild degenerative
changes of the first MTP. There are mild degenerative changes of
the first TMT. There is subchondral sclerosis at both aspects of
the TMT joints. There is mild enthesopathy at the dorsal and
plantar calcaneal insertions. No frank osteomyelitis is
identified in the foot.

ART DUP EXT LO UNI;F/U LEFT Study Date of [**2103-8-30**] 9:15 AM
IMPRESSION: Patent left femoropopliteal bypass graft with low,
resistive
flow. The below-knee popliteal artery appears to occlude not far
below the
terminus of the bypass graft.

ART EXT (REST ONLY) Study Date of [**2103-8-30**] 9:15 AM
IMPRESSION: Severe bilateral lower extremity occlusive disease
without
Doppler flow below the knee. PVRs are aphasic in the calf levels
distally.

CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC RUNOFF W/W&WO C AND RECONS Study Date of
[**2103-8-31**] 12:32 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Occlusion of left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass at its proximal end. Left
external iliac stent is patent. Occlusion of the left SFA and
portions of the left anterior tibial and left posterior tibial
arteries.
2. Occlusion of the right SFA at its mid portion. Areas of
occlusion in the mid course of the right anterior tibial and
right posterior tibial arteries.
3. Indeterminate bilateral low-attenuation adrenal nodules.
Differential
diagnosis includes adrenal adenomata, but they should be
monitored on follow up imaging.

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2103-9-4**] 10:53 AM
FINDINGS:
Since the previous study,the left lower lobe atelectasis is
unchanged. The
lungs are clear with no mass, consolidation or pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary findings




Brief Hospital Course:
[**2103-8-29**] Patient admitted for worsening LLE ulcers. Started on
braod spectrum antibiotics (Vanco, Cipro, Flagyl). NIAS
requested for LE's, foot x-ray, routine wound care.

[**2103-8-30**] HD1: Patient had episodes of hypoglycemia associated
with somnolence, with Metformin on hold, d/c'd Pioglitazone.
Continued routine wound care, and broad spectrum antibiotics.
Podiatry consulted re: L heel ulcer- will need LBKA if
circulation cannot be restored.

[**2103-8-31**] HD2: No acute events. Continued routine wound care, and
broad spectrum antibiotics. Patient had a CTA bilateral lower
extremities- demonstrated 1. Occlusion of left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass at
its proximal end. Left external iliac
stent is patent. Occlusion of the left SFA and portions of the
left anterior
tibial and left posterior tibial arteries. 2. Occlusion of the
right SFA at its mid portion. Areas of occlusion in the mid
course of the right anterior tibial and right posterior tibial
arteries, will need Right femoral-to-dorsalis pedis bypass with
in
situ saphenous vein graft in the future, to be done after L BKA.

8/22-24/09 HD3-5: No acute events. Continued routine wound care,

ahead w/ plans for Right femoral-to-dorsalis pedis bypass to be

[**Date range (1) 89694**]/HD10-16/POD6: Continued BKA pathway. Speech and swallow
evaluation to evaluate for aspiration and diet recs- continue
ground solids and thin liquids. Poor po intake calorie count x 3

confirmed w/ CXR. Continued IV antibiotics. Lisinopril,
Mirtazipine and Furosemide discontinued for low BP. [**9-13**]
Pre-oped, consented, made NPO after MN, IV hydarted for Right
femoral-to-dorsalis pedis bypass.

[**2103-9-14**] HD17/POD7: Taken to OR for Right femoral-to-dorsalis
pedis bypass with in
situ saphenous vein graft. Patient tolerated procedure,
recovered in the PACU then transferred to VICU [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5. Routine
post BKA care. Restarted Heparin drip post-op. Placed lower
extremity bypass pathway.

[**2103-9-15**] HD18/POD7/1: Hct down to 27.8 <-31.5, transfused w/ 1

taken-possible basilar consilidation. First C-diff came back
negative. Urine cultures-negative, blood cultures still pending.
