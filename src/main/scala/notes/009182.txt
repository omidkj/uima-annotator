Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
89-year-old gentleman admitted to an outside hospital on
[**2127-6-5**] for recurrent left ear bleeding and epistaxis.  The
bleeding required 2 units of packed red blood cells to be
transfused.  An MRI demonstrated an opacification of the
mastoid suggestive of a soft tissue mass consistent with
blood clot.  Ultimately, angiography demonstrated a left ICA
pseudoaneurysm.  The patient was transferred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9224**]
service for a left ICA stent placement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Syncope.  Carotid ultrasound, head CT, and MRI were all
negative in [**2126-8-27**].
3.  Gout.
4.  Emphysema.
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient was
pleasant, awake, alert, and oriented times three, afebrile.
Vital signs:  BP was 114/57, heart rate 91, respiratory rate
27.  HEENT:  The patient had left ear packing in place.
Neurologic:  Nonfocal.  He was awake, alert, and oriented
times three.  Moving all extremities.  Cranial nerves II
through XII were intact.  Cardiovascular/respiratory:  Chest
was clear to auscultation.  Regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with a left ICA
pseudoaneurysm with significant bleeding requiring
transfusion at an outside hospital.  He was admitted to the
Neurosurgery Service.  The patient was admitted to the ICU
for close neurologic evaluation and underwent an arteriogram
with stent placement.

On [**2127-6-12**], the patient underwent left ICA stent placement
for pseudoaneurysm.  Post procedure, he was monitored in the
ICU.  He tolerated the procedure well.  He was transferred to
the regular floor on [**2127-6-14**].  He was in stable condition.
He was seen by the Cardiology Service for episodes of SVT.
It was recommended to start him on metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d. and titrate for rate control.  His vital signs
remained stable throughout his stay on the floor and he was
seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and felt to
require rehabilitation.

He was also seen by the Hematology/Oncology Service for
workup of his anemia, although they felt that the extensive
workup could be done as an outpatient and it was not
necessary to do it is an inpatient.

On [**2127-6-18**], the patient was taken back to the Angio Suite
for stent placement for the ICA pseudoaneurysm.  He was
admitted to the ICU post procedure.  He was awake, alert, and
oriented times three.  Pupils 5 down to 4.  He had strong
grasp.  Motor strength in all muscle groups was [**3-31**].  His
visual fields were full to confrontation.  He continued to
have some oozing from the right groin from the sheath.  He
had a crit which was trending downwards.  It was 29.7 on [**2127-6-19**].  His IV heparin was discontinued.  The sheath was
pulled in the afternoon.  The patient's crit continued to
trend down and the patient had a firm right hip and groin
area.

The patient was taken for an abdominal CT on [**2127-6-20**] which
demonstrated a hematoma in the retroperitoneal space and
iliopsas.  The aspririn dose was reduced to 81mg for 3 days and
the Hct remained stable until discharge and after restarting back
on ASA 325 mg.

He was again seen by Cardiology for problems with SVT and was
on some IV Neo while in the unit to keep his blood pressure
above 100.  These were discontinued and the patient was
transferred to the regular floor on [**2127-6-23**].  He continued
on metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. and it was titrated to keep
his heart rate less than 100 and keep his blood pressure
above 100.  He continues to remain neurologically stable.  He
continues back on the Plavix and aspirin.

He was transferred to the regular floor.  He has been seen by
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and found to
require rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q .d.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
