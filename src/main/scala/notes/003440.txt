History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9063**] is a 68 M with h/o CAD, MI, CVA, HTN who presents with
3 months history of dyspnea, cough, and leg swelling.  His

fits that lead to vomiting.  It is worse with laying down.  Leg
swelling has been present over the same time period with more
recent reddening at the ankles.  Patient is sleeping upright but
states [**2-25**] cough and not feelings of orthopnea or PND.  No CP,
dizziness, abd pain, diarrhea, dysuria, fevers.  Large EtOH

.
Of note, the patient is at times a poor historian who has had
little medical care in at least the previous 3 years.

Brief Hospital Course:
A&P: 68 M with CAD, HTN, CVA, chronic EtOH use presents with 3
month h/o worsening dyspnea, cough, leg edema.  He has not been
in the medical system for many years.
.
His dyspnea was worked up and CHF/MI/pna were ruled out as
causes.  The patient was put on a CIWA scale as precaution for
heavy alcohol abuse.  The patient was found to have a large,
fatty liver on US, and on exam demonstrates many of the stigmata
of EtOH abuse.
.
The patient also had b/l LE edema and erythema for which he
received levaquin to treat a possible cellulitis.  Both ankles
improved with treatment and it was d/ced after seven days.
.
Pt was improving on the floor, ready for discharge to an acute
reharb facility when he experienced several episodes of bilious
vomiting.  Initial CT scan appeared to show a small bowel
obstruction.  A NG tube was dropped, with bilious return.
Lactulose was held secondary to SBO.  Patients mental status
continued to deteriorate over the course of the day, he became
tachypneic, and somnolent.  He also became anuric, with little
output after 2.5 liters in 24 hours.  Hepatology and renal were
consulted.  The patient was eventually transferred to the unit
with increasing ammonia levels, changes in mental status and
decreased urine output.
.
In the MICU, pt's delirium and abdominal pain were believed to
be a combination of untreated hepatic encephalopathy and SBO,
with possible bowel perforation and SBP.  He was treated with
lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, Vanc and CTX
for possible SBP with Flagyl for anaerobic coverage in case of
perforation, and IV Albumin for likely hepatorenal syndrome.
Serial ammonia levels and lactates were followed, daily KUBs
were done, as well as daily abdominal US to identify fluid
collection for possible tap.  His acute renal failure was
treated as hypovolemia vs. hepatorenal syndrome, so he was given
albumin as above, plus fluids.  A macrocytic anemia was
identified, and he was started on Vit B12 and folate.  He had
supportive care for his cirrhosis.

As the patient became increasingly hemodynamically unstable with
episodic hypotension and episodes of NSVT, the team decided to
perform paracentesis to help better guide his therapy. The tap
showed > 400 wbcs with few polys, c/w sbp. In spite of continued
agressive antibiotics and supportive care, the patient's overall
coneition contined to deteriororate with continued hypotension,
ARF and ESLD.In discussion with the patient's family, the
patient was made CMO and died from cardiopulmonary arrest on
[**2192-8-10**].
