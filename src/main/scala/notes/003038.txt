Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1112**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 3113**]

HISTORY  OF  THE  PRESENT  ILLNESS:    This  is a 77-year-old
retired  anesthesiologist  visiting the family from [**State 531**],
who  was  admitted  to  [**Hospital1 36651**]
after  the  patient  noted  rales  in  his  chest  with chest
pressure.    In  the  ER the patient was found to be in acute
pulmonary  edema.    The  patient  was treated with Morphine,
sublingual nitroglycerin, Lasix, and aspirin, with subsequent
bradycardia  and hypotension.  Hemodynamic stability returned
after  IV  fluids.   The EKG in the ER showed 2-mm to 3-mm ST
depression   in   leads  V4  through  V6,  as  well  lead  2.
Subsequent EKGs showed 5-mm ST depression in leads V2 through
V6  and leads 2, 3, and AVF.  The patient was admitted to the
hospital for cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
5.  Status post cataract surgery.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Toprol XL 100 mg p.o.q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL  EXAMINATION:  Initial physical examination revealed
the pulse 85; blood pressure 104/64; oxygen saturation 94% on
four  liters  nasal cannula.  GENERAL:  The patient's general
appearance  is  comfortable.    NECK:   Elevated JVP at 9-cm.
CHEST:    Crackles  bilaterally  2/3rds  of the way up, right
greater  than  left.   CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal S1 and S2; 2/6
systolic  murmur  at  the apex.  EXTREMITIES:  Dorsalis pedis
pulses  are  2+ bilaterally.  Extremities are without edema.;
ABDOMEN:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, and nontender.

LABORATORY  DATA:   Data revealed the following:  White blood
cell  count  8.0; hematocrit 38.3; platelet count 130; Chem 7
sodium  139; potassium 3.8; chloride 101; bicarbonate 29; BUN
25, creatinine 1.1; blood sugar 151; PT 12.9; PTT 30.2.

Chest  x-ray  showed  severe  pulmonary  edema, asymmetrical,
right greater than left.

HOSPITAL  COURSE:    The  patient  was  taken  to the Cardiac
Catheterization    Laboratory   on   [**2181-11-16**].      Cardiac
catheterization   showed   EF   of   45%  with  anterior-wall
hypokinesis, 70% LAD lesion, 100% old left circumflex lesion,
80%  PDA lesion, 1+ MR.  The patient underwent echocardiogram
on  [**2181-11-16**],  which  showed  a mildly dilated left atrium,
depressed   left   ventricular   function  with  global  left
ventricular hypokinesis, 1+ AR, 1+ MR.

The  patient  remained in the Coronary Care Unit for diuresis
and  monitoring.  The patient was taken the operating room on
[**2181-11-19**]  with  Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) **].   The patient underwent a CABG
times  three,  LIMA  to  the LAD, SVG to RCA, SVG to OM.  The
patient  was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition  on  Dopamine  infusion  at  5  mcg/kg  per minute.
Please  see  operative note for further details.  The patient
was  weaned  and extubated from mechanical ventilation on his
first  postoperative evening.  Dobutamine infusion was weaned
off  with  the cardiac index greater than three.  The patient
was  transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor on
postoperative  #1.  The patient's chest tubes were removed on
postoperative  day  #1.    The  patient  began  working  with
physical  therapy.   On postoperative day #2, the patient was
able  to  ambulate  500  feet  and climb one flight of stairs
without   any  assistance.    The  patient  was  cleared  for
discharge   by   the   Physical   Therapy   Department.    On
postoperative  day  #3, the patient was cleared for discharge
to home with his daughter.

On  postoperative  day #3, the patient was noted to be mildly
tachycardiac  with  rates  in  the 90s to 100s, sinus rhythm.
The  patient's  hematocrit, at that time, was 23.4.  This was
discussed  with  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was hemodynamically
stable  and  not symptomatic from his anemia.  It was decided
to  discharge  the  patient on his current dose of Lopressor.
The  patient  is  to  followup  in one week for adjustment of
medications, as necessary.

CONDITION  ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature maximum 99; temperature
current  99.1;  pulse  93  sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs;
blood  pressure  126/76; room air oxygen saturation 97%.  The
patient's  weight  on  [**2181-11-22**] was 73.5 kg.  The patient's
preoperative weight was 69 kg.  The patient is neurologically
intact.    Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, positive
rubs,  no  audible  murmur.  Respiratory rate:  Breath sounds
are  clear  bilaterally.  GI:  The patient has positive bowel
sounds.    Abdomen:    Soft,  nontender,  nondistended.   The
patient  is tolerating a regular diet.  The patient has trace
lower  extremity edema.  Sternal incision staples are intact.
The wound is clean, dry, and intact.  There is no erythema or
drainage noted.  The patient's appendectomy site is clean and
dry without erythema or drainage noted.

LABORATORY  DATA:   Data revealed the following:  White blood
cell  count  8.8;  hematocrit  23.4; platelet count 129.  The
Chem  7  revealed  sodium  140,  potassium 4.2, chloride 103,
bicarbonate 31, BUN 15, creatinine 0.8.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
5.  Status post cataract surgery.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.
2.  Pravachol 10 mg p.o.q.h.s.
3.  Niferex 150 mg p.o.q.d.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o.q.d. times two weeks.
6.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq p.o.q.d. times two weeks.
7.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
8.  Ibuprofen 400 to 600 mg p.o., q.4-6h., p.r.n.

The  patient  inquired about restarting his Cardura, which he
was  on preoperatively for benign prostatic hypertrophy.  The
patient  was  told  that  he  should wait several days before
resuming the medication to ensure that his blood pressure and
hemodynamics   remained  stable  on  his  current  medication
regimen.

The  patient  is to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in three to four
weeks.    The patient is to return to the Clinic in two weeks
for  wound  check  and  staple  removal.    The patient is to
followup  with  his  cardiologist  in  three to four weeks at
home.
