History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. [**Known lastname 69503**] is a 49 year old
woman with metastatic breast cancer to bone, liver, lung, and
brain. Patient was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer
in [**2128**], and was found to have metastatic disease in [**Month (only) **]
of [**2131**]. She has undergone chemo, most recently with Taxol and
Avastin. She also underwent whole brain XRT. She is followed in
oncology clinic here with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**]. Importantly, she had a PE in
[**Month (only) 404**] of this year and was placed on Lovenox 100mg daily. Per
a note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**], she was slated to come off of this, and it
seems that this was stopped on [**2132-8-12**] (a fact which her
husband confirms). [**Name2 (NI) **] last brain imaging here was done in [**2132-3-24**] and showed significant interval decrease in size of the
enhancing metastatic lesion within the right frontal lobe, as
well as diminished associated vasogenic edema.
Today she presented to an outside hospital in NH with increasing
HA. Per husband, at approximately 2pm on [**8-23**] she began to
complain of severe bitemporal HA and nausea and vomiting. The
patient presented to the [**State 20192**] Center
at 9:23pm. We were contact[**Name (NI) **] by them stating that they wished to
transfer her here because a head CT showed "hemorrhagic
conversion of a prior known met." By their report she was fully
awake and talking. Patient was given 4mg of MSO4 and a total of
5mg of dilaudid. Per her husband, after the last dose of this
she became poorly responsive. Per [**Location (un) **] team, they arrived
to transfer the patient, only to find her encephalopathic and
satting in the 50's. They decided to intubate her prior to
flight. Prior to intubation she transiently became alert and
talkative. She received 8mg of vecuronium and ativan for
intubation and was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and arrived here at
approximately 1:15a.m. on [**8-24**] intubated and sedated.

We reviewed head CT at OSH and that done here upon arrival. Both
show diffuse SAH, with seemingly thicker clot in the medial
frontal region. Of note, labs at OSH notable for platelets of
139(coags not done).

Past Medical History:
-- breast CA, see above
-- diet controlled DM
-- HTN
-- COPD (asthma and bronchitis)
-- s/p hysterectomy in [**2124**] for menorrhagia
-- h/o lithotripsy for kidney stone in [**2112**]

Social History:
-- accompanied by husband
-- two daughters in college
-- She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.


Family History:
Her mother had coronary artery disease and lung problems. [**Name (NI) **]
father died of esophageal cancer. She has a brother who is
healthy. She has 8 children; she had 2 sets of twins, and one of
the youngest twins died in a miscarriage. A first cousin has
breast cancer.

NEUROLOGICAL: (EXAM DONE ON PROPOFOL with possibility of
lingering vecuronium)
Intubated and Sedated. Pupils 2.5 to 1.5mm bilaterally. No BTT.
No corneals. Trace Doll's. Face symmeteric. +gag. No movement to
deep nailbed pressure. DTRs 3+ throughout with toes upgoing
bilaterally.

Exam on Discharge:
Neurologically intact

Pertinent Results:
LABS: PT 12.9, INR 1.1 platelets 113

CT/CTA head

IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above along
with a small
focus of possible parenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal
parasagittal
location.

2. 6 x 4 mm lobulated aneurysm, at the confluence of the
anterior
communicating artery and the A2 segments of anterior cerebral
arteries,
posisbly ruptured given the extent of acute intracranial
hemorrhage.

3. Slight focal prominence of the M2 branch of the right middle
cerebral
artery.
Please see further details on the conventional angiogram,
performed
subsequently which better demonstrated the aneurysm.

4. Subcm focal lucent lesion in the right frontal bone-
correlate with bone
scan.
 [**2132-9-15**]
FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of
bilateral
common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins.
There is
normal flow, compression and augmentation seen in all the
vessels.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
[**2132-9-1**] CT perfusion

  IMPRESSION:
1. Findings compatible with right frontal lobe infarction,
possibly due to
right ACA A1 segment vasospasm as evidenced by diminutive
caliber on CTA.
2. Anterior communicating aneurysm clip in place with limited
evaluation of
residual patency. Interval decrease in amount of subarachnoid
hemorrhage with
residual blood product in the inferior left frontal region.
3. Punctate left frontal hyperdensity may represent a treated
metastatic
lesion. Additional intracerebral metastases are better
demonstrated on prior
MRI from [**2131-10-25**].
1. Unchanged minimal luminal narrowing of the right A1 segment.
There is no
definite vasospasm.
2. Intra-arterial slow hand infusion of 5 mg of verapamil in
each of the left
internal carotid artery, right internal carotid artery and left
vertebral
artery.
[**2132-9-7**] CT perfusion
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of new intracranial arterial stenosis to suggest
vasospasm.
2. No new territorial infarction. No evidence of new hemorrhage.
The left
hemispheric infarcts demonstrated on the DWI sequence of the
recent MRI are not well appreciated on this study.
3. Expected evolution of the paramedian right frontal lobar
infarct which now shows minimal volume loss.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented on [**2132-8-24**] to an OSH with complaints of
worsening headache.  Imaging was done in the emergency
department of the OSH which showed that she had diffuse SAH the
OSH transfered her to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  whne she arrived
in our ED she was intubated and sedated. Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**]
CTA of the head was done which showed that she had an Anterior
communicating artery aneurysm which had ruptured. She underwent
coiling of the aneurysm x 2, she recevied an intravenous fluid
bolus of 500 cc for a systolic blood pressure in the 80's.  Her
urine output was also borderline oliguric with an average hourly
output of 30cc/hr.  She had RUE weakness both before and after
angio. She was started on Nimodopine and as a result of her
hypotension her dosage was changed from 60mg Q4hours to 30mg
Q2hours.  Also on [**8-24**] a 24hour EEG was ordered for monitoring
and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 69504**] was notified. On [**8-25**] she continued to
remain in the ICU for vasospasm watch. On [**8-26**] she was noted to
continue to have low systolic blood pressures in the 90's. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 739**] was made aware and it was determined that if she
was asymptomatic then her SBP could be liberalized. On [**8-27**] she
remained stable in the ICU and her motor strength was full.  She
complained of headaches in the afternoon ad was started on
firoicet. She did not require the firoicet overnight on [**8-27**] into
[**8-28**] and stated that her headaches were imrpoved.  In the
afternoon of [**8-28**] she had a moderate headache for which Fioricet
was given and provided relief of symptoms.  On exam the morning
of 8.6 she was stable and her exam was nonfocal. The plan going
forward was discussed with her and she was able to verbalize her
understanding. She remained stable in the ICU over the weekend
of [**8-30**] and [**8-31**] with no issues.

On [**9-1**] she was noted to be bradycardic and hypotensive, pacers
were put on standby and she received a CTA/P instead of a
cerebral angiogram.
