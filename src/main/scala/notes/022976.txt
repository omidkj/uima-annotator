Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, desaturation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Attempted shoulder reduction
Placement of a peripherally inserted peripheral venous catheter


History of Present Illness:
82yoF with diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, HTN,
restrictive CMY who presents with fevers, coughing, and hypoxia.
 She was rehabbing at [**Hospital1 **] following a  after a fall
causing right tibial plateau fracture and right shoulder
dislocation status post reduction in the ED [**2119-12-27**].
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were: T101.4 P103 BP123/78 RR22
Sat91% 4L.  She responded to supplemental oxygen via nasal
cannula, rising sats to the low 90s. She was found to be
tachypneic, dyspneic, with bilateral crackles on examination.
Labs revealed no significant leukocytosis, but CXR showed likely
RML and LUL consolidations, for which she received vancomycin
1g, and levofloxacin 750mg. She was also briefly hypotensive to
SBP 70s which was fluid responsive following 1500cc NS.
Pressures have been 100s since. Foley placed.  ED suspected
right shoulder dislocation on portable chest and dedicated
shoulder films. Attempted unsuccessful reduction in ED with 5mg
etomidate, though ortho doubts shoulder actually dislocated.
.
On arrival to the ICU, her initial vitals were:  T99.3 BP118/52
P98 RR21 Sat94% 4L. She predominately complains of right
shoulder pain which is worse than usual due to manipulation in
the ED. She is also thirsty and reveals recently poor PO intake.
She is in no respiratory distress and notes only mild shortness
of breath.  She developed a cough over the past 14 days
occasionally productive of tan sputum, though began to note
general malaise and fatigue last night that worsened this
morning.  +sick contacts at rehab.  Denies chest heaviness,
pleuritic chest pain, or lower calf pain.  She has been on
dalteparin for DVT prophylaxis.
.
On review of systems, she denies nausea, vomiting, dysuria,
hematuria, constipation, diarrhea, headaches, sore throat,
rhinorrhea, lower extremity edema, chest pressure, wheezing.

IMAGING
Chest xray [**2120-1-5**]- FINDINGS: Consolidative opacities involving
the left upper lobe and right middle lobe are suspicious for
multifocal pneumonia. Small left effusion may also be present.
There is no pulmonary edema. The heart is top normal in size
with normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Right shoulder does
not appear well seated in the glenoid and correlation with exam
findings and dedicated shoulder radiographs is recommended.
Large hiatal hernia is unchanged.
.
Shoulder R xray [**2120-1-5**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Right anterior shoulder dislocation. Recommend repeat
radiographs upon relocation to exclude an osseous Bankart
injury.
.
2. Persistent right medial lung base opacity, compatible with
known pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Severe sepsis due to:
2. Pneumonia, HCAP; complicated by:
3. Acute renal failure
4. Hypotension

# Severe sepsis due to health care associated pneumonia: Her
fevers, cough, hypoxia, and paired consolidations are consistent
with a multifocal healthcare associated pneumonia. As she has
tolerated cephalosporins previously despite her PCN allergy, we
expanded her abx to HCAP coverage with vancomycin, cefepime, and
levafloxacin for a planned 8 day course. She continued
oxygenating well on NC which kept her O2 sats in the low-mid
90s. Upright positioning, incentive spirometry, and time out of
bed were also stressed during her treatment. We also considered
that her hypoxia may be more pronounced in the setting of
restrictive lung disease (hiatal hernia). Other possibilities to
consider include pulmonary embolism (unlikely due to ppx at
rehab), aspiration pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema (unlikely
due to distribution of infiltrate and likely hypovolemia on
exam). She was transferred from the MICU to the medicine floor
on [**1-6**] where she continued to improve.  A PICC was placed on
[**2120-1-8**] in preparation for antibiotics at rehab.  She was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] facility on [**2120-1-8**].

# Hypotension: Her brief hypotension in the ED was fluid
responsive suggesting a hypovolemic/distributive source,
supported by [**Last Name (un) **], elevated lactate, dry membranes, and a history
of recently decreased PO intake.  Septic shock is unlikely due
to her current stability following resuscitation.  We held
anti-hypertensives and diuretics on admission, and encouraged PO
intake, and were careful with fluid boluses given diastolic
heart failure.

# Shoulder pain: Orthopedics team does not suspect dislocation
after attending review of the plain films.  We proceeded with
conservative mana
