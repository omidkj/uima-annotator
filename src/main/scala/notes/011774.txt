Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for possible intervention/bronch for tracheal stenosis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
64 yo F w/ h/o COPD s/p trach in [**2155**], CAD s/p CABG in [**2145**], CHF
(LVEF 60%), who on [**2157-11-8**] had a #10 T-tube placed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **]. However, due to significant supraglottic redundant tissue
stenosis was not amenable to dilation. Since the time of
procedure, the patient has had persistent dyspnea and on the day
of transfer was referred to [**Hospital3 2737**] ED by her VNA due to
increased work of breathing. The patient in [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] had
wheezing, respiratory distress, SpO2 89%. Patient reports
increased production of white sputum. Denies fevers or chills.
No chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation any
other complaints.

Past Medical History:
1. DMII - on insulin
2. CAD s/p CABG for 3-V disease approximately 12 years ago at
[**Hospital 4415**].
3. [**Name (NI) 3672**] Pt had a severe COPD exacerbation and question PNA
approximately two years ago. She was on a ventilator at that
time which was eventually converted to a trach.  She has never
been able to come off of the trach.
4. CHF - EF 25% in [**7-/2157**]
5. GERD
6. Depression

.
CXR [**2157-11-13**]: The cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vascularity
appear slightly more prominent compared to previous studies, but
could potentially be accentuated by extreme apical lordotic
projection. However, it is difficult to exclude mild volume
overload as a cause for these findings. There are no confluent
areas of consolidation within the lungs or significant
atelectasis.
.
CXR [**2158-1-13**]: Tracheostomy tube has a longer than standard
intrathoracic component, presumably treatment for the tracheal
stricture demonstrated on [**11-7**] chest CT scan. Lungs are
clear. There is no atelectasis and no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Dilated right
pulmonary artery may be due to pulmonary arterial hypertension
or adenopathy. The patient has had median sternotomy and
coronary bypass grafting.
.
CXR [**2157-11-11**]: No evidence of pneumonia on a limited study.
Followup views should be obtained if there is persistent
concern.


Brief Hospital Course:
A 64 year-old female with COPD, CAD, CHF with h/o tracheal
stenosis who is s/p #10 T tube placement (on [**2157-11-8**]) who
presented with increased work of breathing and dyspnea.
.
1. Dyspnea: Etiology: COPD exacerbation vs. CHF exacerbation vs.
pneumonia (had elevated WBC on admission) or T tube obstruction.
 Initially on CMV ventilation at 300x12/35%/5, and at the time
of discharge was on 15L/m FiO2 35% via facemask.  The Pt.
required frequent suctioning of upper airway mucus/secretions.
Pt. bronched and evaluated by interventional pulmonology,
recommended leaving T-Tube in place with continued suctioning
PRN and encouragement to cough on her own to clear
mucus/secretions.  Continue albuterol and Ipratropium nebs.
Plan to continue prednisone taper (for COPD exacerbation)
post-discharge (today [**2157-11-16**] is day 2 of 3 of 20mg/day).  Pt.
was switched to IV lasix during hospitalization, and was
switched back to PO in preparation for discharge.  Her daily
weights and strict Is/Os were monitored.  Due to rising
bicarbonate, she was also given diamox 500mg IV q12 for two
days.
.
2. CAD s/p CABG.  Home doses of ASA, carvedilol, lisinopril,
lipitor and Zetia were continued during hospitalization.
Telemetry monitoring was continued throughout the entire
hospitalization.
.
3. PVD. Continued Trental.
.
4. GERD. Continued Protonix.
.
5. DM. Patient was found to be hypoglycemic on admission.  She
was maintained on an ISS, and her home dose of NPH insulin (60U
QAM) was restarted prior to d/c.  Her NPH dose was adjusted
during hospitalization based on her PO intake.  Fingersticks
were monitored routinely.
.
6. CHF EF 25% ([**7-26**]). Patient appeared to be mildly volume
overloaded.  IV Lasix (and diamox) were used for diuresis.  The
patient was diuresed with a goal of >500cc negative per day.
.
7. UTI: The patients admission urinalysis was consistent with a
UTI.  She was treated with a three day course of Bactrim (today
[**2157-11-16**] is day 2).
.
8. Depression: Continued fluoxetine.
.
9. FEN: Cardiac diet.  Repleted electrolytes as per routine.
.
10. Prophylaxis: Bowel regimen.  Heparin SQ.  PPI.
.
11. Code: Full.
.
12. Communication: Patient & her daughter.
