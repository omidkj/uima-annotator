HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  (Per admitting ICU house staff):
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] is a 49-year-old woman with a past medical history
significant for diabetes mellitus type 1 with triopathy, as
well as history of DKA, end stage renal disease, CAD, and
CABG, who presented with loose bowel movements and abdominal
discomfort from her nursing home.  The patient was dialyzed
on the Friday before presentation and reported that
approximately 8 lbs had been dialyzed off of her.  The
history from the patient was limited by her sleepiness
(although she was arousable); the patient was responsive to
questions when prompted repeatedly.  According to records,
the patient had eaten a tuna [**Location (un) 6002**] during her above noted
dialysis session and had felt "bad" afterwards, with
increased abdominal discomfort, loose stools.  The patient
denied history of blood or mucus in her stools.  She also
denied history of fevers, chills, cough, shortness of breath,
chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Diabetes mellitus type 1:
Complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, blindness; end stage
renal disease.  2) End stage renal disease, status post
failed renal transplant ([**2126**]); on hemodialysis three times a
week; left AV fistula placed in [**2140-3-28**].  3) Coronary artery
disease: Status post CABG ([**2132**]); status post MI in [**9-28**],
status post cardiac catheterization in [**11-28**], which revealed
three vessel disease, with patent LIMA to LAD.  4) Systolic
dysfunction:  Echocardiogram in [**9-28**] revealed left
ventricular ejection fraction of 20-30% with 3+ MR, 1+ TR,
mild pulmonary hypertension, and global hypokinesis.  5) Left
bundle branch block.  6) Squamous cell carcinoma.  7)
Hepatitis C:  Diagnosed in [**2-26**].  8) MRSA bacteremia
(attributed to fistula in [**9-28**]).  9) VRE in urine.  10)
Acute on chronic cholecystitis diagnosed [**10-28**]; no
cholecystectomy was performed.  11) Peripheral vascular
disease, status post left femoral tibial bypass.  12)
Hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  Demerol, ? IV Ciprofloxacin, ? Ambien (as of this
current admission).

MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient medications: Vicodin, Compazine,
Neurontin, Insulin, Nepro, Prevacid, Celexa, Nephrocaps.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a disabled nurse.  She lives
in a skilled nursing facility.  She denied any history of
tobacco or alcohol use.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the ICU from her
skilled nursing facility on [**2142-2-10**] with diabetic
ketoacidosis; also she subsequently ruled in for a non Q wave
MI.

To summarize, the patient presented with an approximate 24
hour history of gastroenteritis which included diarrhea; the
patient was somewhat somnolent though arousable on arrival.
Her anion gap on presentation was 27 and subsequently closed
to 25 and then 20 shortly after arrival.  The patient's
troponin was 9.4 on arrival and rose to a peak of 13.8 before
trending downward.  The patient's CKs were negative, although
MB index was 12.7.  The patient's glucose was 699 on arrival.

The patient was treated with IV fluid and an insulin drip,
and subsequently her anion gap closed within approximately 24
hours; thereafter, the patient's outpatient insulin regimen
was resumed and her fingerstick blood sugars remained for the
most part stable (although on occasion, the patient did
refuse to take her insulin).  The patient was able to advance
her diet without difficulty.

Regarding the patient's non Q wave MI, the cardiology service
was consulted.  Cardiology staff felt that the patient would
benefit most from medical management; thus the patient was
maintained on Aspirin and Lopressor.  For a brief period, the
patient was on a Heparin drip which was subsequently
discontinued once her enzymes were convincingly trending
downward, and she remained without chest pain.  (It should be
noted that the patient remained chest pain free during her
hospitalization).

The patient's ICU course was, for the most part, uneventful.
She did exhibit some mild hypotension; and chest x-ray on
[**2142-2-11**] at 2 p.m. revealed some new CHF as well as some small
bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient was eventually felt
to be somewhat fluid overloaded, and thus she had
approximately 5 kg of fluid removed at dialysis on [**2142-2-14**],
with much improvement and feeling bloated.

Also of note, the patient was given Ambien on one evening, to
help her sleep; the next morning the patient was somewhat
confused on awakening and this was attributed to her having
taken Ambien.

On [**2142-2-12**] the patient was transferred from the ICU to the
medicine floor.  Thereafter the patient's course remained
fairly stable.  Her insulin regimen was maintained, although,
as noted above, the patient did on occasion refuse to take
her insulin.  It should also be noted that the patient had
refused telemetry as well on transfer to the medicine floor.
Ultimately, the patient did well with hemodialysis, and her
fingersticks improved on the morning of discharge.

Of note, the patient's potassium was somewhat elevated on
[**2142-2-14**] (6.3 and then 5.6); patient's potassium will be
checked at 1 p.m. on [**2-14**] prior to discharging her to skilled
nursing facility.

Also of note, on transfer to the medicine floor a urinalysis
revealed that the patient did have significant number of
white cells in her urine; thus patient was prescribed renal
dose of Levofloxacin.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Vital signs stable, afebrile, free
of chest pain and shortness of breath, anxious to be
discharged to her skilled nursing facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Diabetic ketoacidosis.
2.  Non Q wave myocardial infarction.

8.  Left bundle branch block.
9.  Urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Levofloxacin 250 mg po q o day (next
dose to be given on [**2142-2-16**]), times four more doses, Heparin

insulin sliding scale for qid fingersticks, as follows:  for
fingerstick of 201-250 give 2 units regular insulin subcu,
for fingerstick 251-300 given 4 units regular insulin subcu,
for 301-350 given 6 units regular insulin subcu, for 351-400
give 8 units regular insulin subcu, for greater than 400 give
fingerstick less than 60, give [**Location (un) 2452**] juice and/or one amp of
D50, and notify M.D.

DISCHARGE DIET:  The patient should be maintained on a renal
diet, a well as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] and low sodium diet, also, it is
important that the patient remain fluid restricted to one
liter of fluid per day.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to continue follow-up at dialysis
three times per week.  Also, the patient is to follow-up with
her cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], on [**2142-2-21**] at 9:20 a.m.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] may decide to adjust the patient's cardiac regimen
further.  Also, ultimately, the patient may benefit from
cardiac rehabilitation.
