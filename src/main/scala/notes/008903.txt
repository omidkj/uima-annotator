Brief Hospital Course:
Urology summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12303**] was admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and
obstructing right mid-ureteral stone. He underwent right laser
lithotripsy of ureteral stone and ureteral stent placement
[**2163-7-18**]. Post-operative course complicated by pulmonary edema and
he was observed in the intensive care unit and diuresed. Foley
removed POD1. At discharge patient's pain well controlled with
oral pain medications, tolerating regular diet, voiding without
difficulty, and oxygenating well on room air. He will follow-up
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 770**] as an outpatient for stent removal and
his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2 weeks for creatinine check and medication
reconcilation (captopril and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] held).

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12303**] was admitted for monitoring after a desaturation while
in the PACU after lithotripsy. This most likely represents
obesity-hypoventilation complicated by derecruitment of alveoli
with peri-procedural sedation. The patient almost certainly has
sleep apnea by history (snoring and apneic spells) and exam
(thick neck). He was also diuresed >3L given IVF administered
prior to procedure and holding of diuretics on admission with
pre-procedure renal failure. At the time of transfer he did have
a 4L oxygen requirement to keep SaO2>90%. He was evaluated by
sleep medicine who recommended auto-BiPap prior to discharge and
outpatient sleep study and sleep medicine follow-up.

Discharge Instructions:
Specific insturctions:
You may shower and bathe normally.  Do not drive or drink
alcohol if taking narcotic pain medication. Hold [**Hospital **] and
captopril until you see your primary care doctor within [**2-9**]
weeks. Otherwise, resume all of your home medications. Call Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] office for follow-up appointment
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5727**]) AND if you have any urological questions.  If you

inability to urinate, call your doctor or go to the nearest
emergency room.

Definitions
Ureter: the duct that transports urine from the kidney to the
bladder:
Stent: a plastic hollow tube that is placed into the ureter,
from the kidney to the bladder to prevent the ureter from
swelling shut.

General Instructions
Despite the fact that no skin incisions were used, the area
around the ureter and bladder is irritated. The stent is
required in order keep the ureter open and urine flowing from
the kidney to the bladder. Because one end of the ureter is in
the bladder, it can cause irritation to the bladder. Therefore,
it is normal to feel that you need the urge to urinate
frequently when the stent is in place. Although the stent can be
uncomfortable, it is important to have the stent to avoid
damaging the kidney and ureter after your procedure. You may see
some blood in your urine while the stent is in place and a few
days afterward. Drink lots of fluid ?????? this will help clear up
your urine.

Diet
You may return to your normal diet immediately. Because of the
raw surface of your bladder, alcohol, spicy foods, acidy foods
and drinks with caffeine may cause irritation or frequency and
should be used in moderation. To keep your urine flowing freely
and to avoid constipation, drink plenty of fluids during the day
(8 - 10 glasses).

Activity
Your physical activity doesn't need to be restricted. However,
if you are very active, you may see some blood in the urine. We
would suggest to cut down your activity under these
circumstances until the bleeding has stopped.

Bowels
It is important to keep your bowels regular during the
postoperative period. Straining with bowel movements can cause
bleeding. A bowel movement every other day is reasonable. Use a
mild laxative if needed, such as Milk of Magnesia [**3-13**]
Tablespoons, or 2 Dulcolax tablets. Call if you continue to have
problems. If you had been taking narcotics for pain, before,
during or after your surgery, you may be constipated. Take a
laxative if necessary.

Medication
You should resume your pre-surgery medications unless told not
to. In addition you will often be given an antibiotic to prevent
infection. These should be taken as prescribed until the bottles
are finished unless you are having an unusual reaction to one of
the drugs.

Problems [**Name (NI) **] Should Report to Us
a. Fevers over 100.5 Fahrenheit.
b. Heavy bleeding, or clots (See notes above about blood in
urine).
c. Inability to urinate.
d. Drug reactions (Hives, rash, naus
