Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vancomycin / Oxycodone / Lorazepam

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
89 yo M with tracheo-bronchomalazcia s/p stents [**8-/2171**],
multiple bronchoscopy, s/p tracheostomy [**9-/2172**], s/p tracheal
decannulization in [**6-/2173**], COPD, PAF, CAD, and other medical
issues transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with [**Hospital3 2742**] of PNA,
COPD exacerbation, and possible AVR given AS.
.
Per report, patient was readmitted to [**Hospital3 **] after
being home for a few days ([**Date range (1) 31206**], [**Date range (1) 12903**]).  For his
initial admission [**9-18**], he was treated with levofloxacin and
steroid.  He represented with SOB and underwent bronchoscopy
(pre-scheduled) that found large amount of secretion.  After
mucous plug removal, his respiratory status improved, but still
had dyspnea on exertion and hypoxia down to the 80s.  He was
given antibiotics with imipenem (ESBL E. coli), linezolid
(history of MRSA, allergy to vanco), nebs, O2 supplement, and
steroid.  Pulmonary consult at [**Hospital1 **] recommended
discontinuation of the antibiotics if his patchy infiltrate
improved.
.
Upon transfer, VS were 97.4F, P 74, BP 141/68, RR 15, O2 Sat 98%
on 4L.
.
On the floor, patient reports some dyspnea, especially with
exertion, worse with the COPD exacerbation.  He reports having
COPD exacerbation requiring up to 3-4L O2, then was sent home on
40 mg prednisone, Levoquin, and O2.  Of note, prior to the COPD
exacerbation, he states no O2 requirement.  Subsequently
returned to hospital because he felt the COPD exacerbation was
worse again.  Thus, prompting bronchoscopy.  He states that he
is usually not on any home oxygen until this COPD exacerbation.
Has been having several months of orthopnea and PND.  He reports
chest discomfort with coughing but not with exertion.  Denies
palpitation, dizzziness, lightheadedness, or presyncope.  He
does not think he has LE edema but was told that he has it in
[**Hospital3 **].  He wants to make sure his cardiologist and
pulmonologist are informed of his admission today.

AP CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Low lung volumes with atelectasis, more on the right, but no
definite
evidence for pneumonia.

ECHO [**2173-9-27**]
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The aortic valve
is not well seen. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY
89 yo M with tracheo-bronchomalazcia s/p stents [**8-/2171**],
multiple bronchoscopy, s/p tracheostomy [**9-/2172**], s/p tracheal
decannulization in [**6-/2173**], COPD, PAF, CAD s/p CABG transferred
for [**Year (4 digits) 2742**] of AVR and possible tracheoplasty, neither of
which are an option for this patient, per the consulting
services.  His COPD exacerbation has been treated and the
patient has been stabilized.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# COPD exacerbation, potentially [**12-30**] CAP. Found to have ESBL e.
coli on bronchoscopy at OSH. given history, clinical picture and
other underlying comorbidities and allergy to vanc, pt on
linezolid and meropenem, w/ symptomatic improvement.  Seen by
interventional pulm.  PICC placed. Pt w/ some coughing this AM.
Pt w/ significant crackles and rhonchi. Dyspnea and saturations
stable in past 48 hours, aside from some episodes of coughing.
Seen by PT yesterday w/ preserved ambulatory sats on 4L O2 (low
90%s). WBC had increased today on initial CBC (from 14->22), but
a repeat CBC a matter of hours later showed a WBC of 17 (not
significantly different from admission of 15.2).  Thus, the 22.0
was likely a spurious lab test, and repeat diff reassuring.
Sending additional labs regardless (c.diff, ua), but we believe
this is most probably the effect of steroid initiations.  We
appreciated pulmonology recs, which recommended outpt f/u and no
interventions. Throughout the pt's hospitalization, he was on
40mg prednisone (aside from 60mg on day one).  Pt sent to rehab
on following taper: Take 40mg for 7 days, followed by 30 mg for
7 days, followed by 20mg for 7 days. Your pulmonologist should
see you before you go down any further.  Will continue
antibiotics for 14 days considering considerable structural
disease and potential hospital acquired
