Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. PFO is present.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending
aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderate-sized vegetation on aortic valve. No AS.
Moderate to severe (3+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: No MVP. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage
A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There is a
moderate-sized vegetation of 0.6 to 1.5 cm on the aortic valve
(left and extending onto the non-coronary cusp. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname 17661**]
[**Known lastname 33733**] at 10AM before incision.

Post-Bypass:
Normal biventricular systolic function.
Intact interatrial septum post repair with no flows across with
color doppler.
Thre is a bioprosthetic valve at the native aortic position with
normal function and stability, with a residual peak and mean of
20 and 10mm of Hg.
Thoracic aortic contour is intact.
Mild MR.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Provisional Findings Impression: CXWc [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**2103-1-5**] 10:20 PM
Focal splenic defect consistent with infarct, although acuity
unknown, this
could be due to septic embolus. No acute vascular abnormalities
identified on
this exam. No other end organ damage. Post-surgical changes into

mediastinum, without fluid collection or pericardial effusion.
Atelectasis at
the lung bases.


Final Report
INDICATION: 56-year-old man status post endocarditis and aortic
valve
replacement. Evaluate for septic emboli.

COMPARISON: [**2103-1-2**] coronary CTA.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the
chest,
abdomen and pelvis following administration of intravenous
contrast material.
Multiplanar reformatted images were generated.

CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post aortic
valve
replacement, and post-surgical changes are seen throughout the
mediastinum,
consisting of a small amount of pneumomediastinum, soft tissue
stranding and
edema, although without focal fluid collection. Transcutaneous
pacing wires
are present. Median sternotomy closure wires are intact. The
heart remains
slightly enlarged, but there is no pericardial effusion. There
is no hilar or
mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Great vessels are within normal
limits.

Lungs demonstrate a small amount of dependent atelectasis,
greater at the lung
bases. There is a small right pleural effusion. There is no
consolidation or
pneumothorax. The tracheobronchial tree is patent to
