syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 76 year old female who presents with a ?
syncopal episode. She has a history significant for CVA, TIA,
dCHF and Parkinson's disease. She was on her way to the
dentist's office with her daughter (also a difficult historian).
She was walking up the stairs and stopped on a landing and
slumped forward. There was no head strike or loss of
consciousness, however she was briefly "out of it" per her
family, for 15-20 minutes. No chest pain, nausea, vomiting. Has
been having left lower dental pain for a few days, today with
lower facial swelling. Was going to dentist to have this looked
at when this episode happened. One sick contact in family with
URI. Possibly had some rhinorrhea & mild cough over the past few
days but unable to verify history. Afebrile.

The patient's daughter also states that her mother has been
slowly becoming more demented but has episodes of lucidity. She
has been calling her by the wrong name on occasion and she is
never oriented to year or month.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.9  BP 141/93  HR 74  Sat 93%
on 4L. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, which is the patient's
baseline.  Labs and imaging significant for troponin of 0.67.
Patient given ASA 325 mg and clindamycin for presumed oral
infection.

On arrival to the floor, patient was agitated & confused, but
followed simple commands; was oriented to place and person, but
did not know the year. This might be her baseline, but daughter
is not very cooperative to relay this information, stating that
her mother is sometimes like this. Her vitals were
96.6-146/88-71-20-95RA.

Past Medical History:
- Parkinson's Disease
- Atrial fibrillation
- Hypertension
- Pulmonary artery hypertension
- h/o AVNRT (per [**2158**] cardiology note, she is "status post AV
node reentrant tachycardia ablation in [**2148**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
at the [**Hospital3 **]. She was initially diagnosed with atrial
fibrillation in [**2157-11-20**], which has been managed with rate
control and aspirin due to fall risk.")
- Glaucoma
- Cataracts
- History of epistaxis
- Iron deficiency anemia
- Depression

Social History:
Lives in her own apartment; daughter and one of her two sons
both live in the same apartment building, both reportedly visit
daily. Past notes note no tobacco or EtOH abuse history. Per the
geriatrics fellow note, she is "able to dress self and feed
self, has been staying in bed most of time recently and relying
on family to come to help with toileting and transferring, has
housekeeper, daughter brings in meals and helps with medications
and transportation, uses walker or cane to ambulate."

Family History:
Non-contributory.

CARDIOLOGY

[**1-17**] TTE
LVEF >55%
IMPRESSION: Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional systolic function. At least moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-10-24**], the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure and severity of mitral
regurgitation are slightly increased.

2/28 PERSANTINE MIBI
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is adequate. Left ventricular cavity size is
normal with EDV of 99 ml. Rest and stress perfusion images
reveal moderate fixed lateral wall perfusion defect. Gated
images reveal normal wall motion. The calculated left
ventricular ejection fraction is 53%. Compared to the study from
[**2159-1-3**], these changes are new.
IMPRESSION: Moderate fixed lateral wall perfusion defect with
normal LV systolic function.

RADIOLOGY

[**1-14**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology. 2. Small vessel
ischemic disease.

[**1-14**] CXR (PA/Lat)
IMPRESSION: 1. Severe cardiomegaly, unchanged. 2. Prominence of
pulmonary vessels, suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion.
3. Left hemidiaphragm appears obscured, which is likely due to
left basal atelectasis, however superimposed infection cannot be
fully excluded.

[**1-16**] MRI HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe microangiopathic small vessel
disease. No convincing evidence of acute infarction within the
study limitation degraded by motion artifact.

[**1-20**] CXR (Portable)
Mammoth cardiomegaly is longstanding. Mild pulmonary edema has
worsened. More focal consolidation in the right upper lobe could
be pneumonia, hemorrhage, or contusion based on clinical
history. Occasionally, mitral regurgitation will give more focal
edema in the right upper lobe. Pleural effusion is minimal, if
any. No pneumothorax.

MICROBIOLOGY

- [**1-14**] Blood cultures: NO GROWTH.
- [**1-19**] CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST: FECES POSITIVE FOR
C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
- [**1-20**] MRSA SCREEN: No MRSA isolated.
