Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Swan-Ganz catheterization


History of Present Illness:
79 year-old female with history of sarcoidosis, moderate
pulmonary hypertension, ILD, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who
presents with acute on chronic dyspnea.  She is followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient and was last seen by him on [**2114-5-25**];
at that time, she was doing well, satting 95% on 4L at rest.
Her recent history is notable for an admission at the end of
[**2114-3-4**] where she presented with worsening dyspnea, ruled out
for PE, and was transitioned from prednisone to sildenafil.  She
has seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the interim and started on lasix for
volume overload in the setting of right heart failure and
prednisone-related fluid retention and weight gain.  As noted
above, she was been doing well, using a stable amount of
supplemental oxygen at home and able to ambulate several feet
with only mild dyspnea.

Two days prior to admission, however, she noted worsening
dyspnea with exertion.  She also developed a nonproductive cough
but denied sick contacts, fevers, chills, arthralgias, and chest
pain.  Her symptoms worsened and she called Dr.[**Doctor Last Name **]
office on the day of admission and was advised to present to the
ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.1 141/53 73 26 84%4L. She was
placed on a NRB with 100% o2 sat and given solumedrol 125 mg IV
x 1.  A chest x-ray showed bilateral interstial infiltrates and
she was admitted to the MICU for further management.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No
recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.


Past Medical History:
# pulmonary artery HTN, on 2LPM continuous with exertion to
maintain O2 saturation > 88% (96% on 4L pulsed); RA sat as low
as 76% w/ ambulation per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2114-5-4**].
# sarcoidosis with ILD, s/p right lower lobe resection in [**2075**]
# hypertension
# diabetes
# renal insufficiency baseline creatinine 1.2-1.6
# osteoarthritis
# iron deficiency anemia
# osteopenia
# hyperlipidemia
# colonic adenomas
# s/p hysterectomy
# s/p cataract surgery


Social History:
Denies present or past tobacco or alcohol use.  Lives at home
with her granddaughter.


Family History:
Her family history is notable for a mother who had a history of
hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease; a father
with diabetes and coronary artery disease; and a brother also
with hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. She
denies any known history in her family of sarcoidosis or other
lung diseases.

STUDIES:
[**2114-6-4**] CT CHEST: No PE, though evaluation of subsegmental
vessels at left base is limited. New bilateral small effusions
and compressive atalectasis with scattered thickened septal
lines- ? edema, less likely changes related to sarcoid.

[**2114-6-5**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2113-11-2**], the right ventricle appears slightly larger and free
wall motion appears similar to slightly more depressed.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.

[**2114-6-4**] CXR: bilateral interstitial opacities, no focal
infiltrate, bibasilar atelectasis, likely small left pleural
effusion

ADMISSION EKG:  NSR, nl axis, nl intervals, TWIs in V1-V4 (old
except for V2), S-wave in I, Q-wave in III, TWI in III (all old)


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo woman with h/o sarcoid, pulm HTN and diastolic CHF,
presenting with acute on chronic SOB [**2-5**] volume overload.
Transfered to floor [**2114-6-7**] with subtle PE findings c/w residual
volume overload. Symptoms at rest improving with diuresis.
Comfortable breathing but using more O2 than baseline.

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Chest CTA showed new pleural
effusions and no PE. It was thought she might have acute
diastolic CHF. She was diuresed with 40mg IV lasix x2 with net
fluid balance of -1L; however her creatinine increased from
1.4-1.8 so diuresis was stopped. TTE showed worsend PAH and
right ventricular dilation. Flu swab was negative. She was
initially started on empiric vanc/zosyn, however, after the CTA
showed no evidence of PNA these were discontinued and she
remained afebrile. A swan-ganz catheter was placed and her wedge
pressure was elevated as well as her PAP. She was diuresed
further (lasix 40mg IV X 3) with good effect. Her O2 was able to
be weaned down to 88-93% on 6L NC. Aggressive diuresis was
continued with lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], with stable O2 sat in low 90s on
6L NC. She was called out to the floor on [**6-7**]. She was evaluated
by PT and d/c'd on [**6-9**] with home PT services. She was d/c'd on
6L NC and lasix 80mg daily given evidence of residual
