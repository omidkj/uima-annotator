History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 yo F w/PMHx sx for autoimmune hepatitis on
chronic prednisone, IDDM, CAD, seizure d/o, hypertension,
asthma, hx RCC, and ET who presents with hyperglycemia.
.
Patient recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 65044**] with URI and
asthma exacerbation and received nebulizers and steroids. Her
fingersticks during that admission were in the 200-300s. She had
multiple episodes of chest pain while hospitalized, with
negative workup for ischemia, with episodes relieved by
oxycodone. She improved her peak flows to 300 and was
subsequently discharged. At home, patient fell on her back [**2-11**]
dizziness thought to be from diarrhea and vomiting, with assoc
subjective fevers and chills. SHe was then seen at [**Hospital1 65045**] in [**Location (un) 260**] MA where she was admitted from
[**Date range (1) 65046**], and given the diagnosis of an L1 compression fracture.
She was taken off her prednisone during this admission per her
report, and was sent home without pain medications. Today, she
presented to [**Company 191**] complaining of [**10-19**] lower back pain. Patient
was also sent home on 65u lantus qhs, decreased from her
baseline of 100u qhs. Patient's BS at home have ranged from
300s-500s. She also notes urinary incontinence, which is her
baseline from her early 40s, but denies stool incontinence. She
also notes numbness, tingling and weakness of her legs. She
states that her back pain is relieved only by muscle relaxants
and narcotics. Pt also notes polyuria, polydipsia, and extreme
thirst. She also notes dizziness on standing. She denies
dysuria. She does admit to diffuse abdominal pain, occasional
difficulty breathing. She denies chest pain. Pt's baseline BS
per her report are in the 200s.
.
In the ED patient was found to have blood sugars in the 400s.
Patient was also found to have an anion gap of 15, with trace
ketones in the urine. Patient's EKG showed old ST depressions in
V1-V3 with TWI< unchanged from prior. Her UA was negative for
infection. Her CXR was unremarkable as well. She was admitted
for management of her blood sugars.
.
ROS: Positive for polyuria, polydipsia, abd pain, fevers,
chills, thirst, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, urinary
frequency. Negative for headache and dysuria, or fecal
incontinence.

[**Month/Day/Year 4338**] L-spine: L1 compression fracture with mild retropulsion of
bone fragments posteriorly resulting in moderate spinal canal
narrowing. There is also an epidural hematoma, which travels
inferiorly from this level and terminates posterior to L2. There
is no further spinal canal narrowing due to this epidural
hematoma.

CT C-spine:
1. No cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
2. Very mild degenerative changes as noted above.
3. Atherosclerotic calcification at the right carotid artery
bifurcation.

T/L- spine xray: Anterior wedge compression fracture of the L1
vertebral body, grossly unchanged in appearance compared to the
CT scan of two days prior


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hyperglycemia:
Patient with blood sugars in the 400-500s initially, with anion
gap metabolic acidosis. Patient with type 2 DM, so unlikely to
be DKA, but does have evidence of ketones in urine, likely [**2-11**]
starvation. Blood sugars not as elevated as would be expected in
HHNS, and no signs of renal failure or severe dehydration.
Likely etiology of hyperglycemia is insulin deficiency from
change in insulin regimen at OSH. BS on arrival normalized to
200s.  No clear infection.  She was initially placed on insulin
gtt and then transitioned to lantus and humalog with SS.  On
this regimen, her blood sugars were improved in 100-200s though
not perfectly controlled.

.
2) Altered mental status:
Likely due to hyperglycemia.  REsolved.
.
3) Low back pain:
Patient diagnosed with L1 fracture at OSH, no records here.
Likely [**2-11**] compression fracture from chronic steroid use.  Due
to question of weakness on exam, [**Month/Day (2) 4338**] L-spine obtained which
showed L1 fracture with retropulsion of fragments into spinal
canal and hematoma.  Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended
conservative management given many comorbities.  She was placed
in a TLSO brace which she needs to have on any time her head is
greater than 30 degreess or upright.
.
4) Autoimmune hepatitis:
LFTs stable.  Continued on prednisone and imuran.
.
5) Asthma. Continue Montelukast, combivent.
.
6) Hx seizures.:
Continued on keppra.
.
7) HTN.

.

Stable, continued on outpt regimen.
