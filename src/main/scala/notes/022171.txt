Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue, shortness of breath, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotrachial intubation

History of Present Illness:
64-year-old M with h/o single-vessel CABG in [**2139**], hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, as well as PAF who presented with 3
days of fatigue and shortness of breath along with recent onset
of fevers.  He was not feeling well in general over several
days, but got acutely ill at a barbeque with his family.  He was
sitting in a chair at the event and he felt so weak that he
could not stand.  He needed multiple family members to help him
up out of the chair and noted that he felt extremely hot at this
time.  He has had chills at home on a relatively regular basis
since the late [**2134**].  He endorsed fever to 101 over the weekend
as well as nausea and decreased PO intake with one day of
diarrhea.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.9 77 105/74 24 99%RA. On
monitor SBP in 70s. He went into afib with RVR 176 at fastest.
Given 4L fluid and HR decrease 120-130, SBP to 100-119. Given
calcium, dilt 10mg(5mg+5mg) IV. Took asa today. Spiked to 102.7
in ED and CXR showed lingular opacity. After about 4L fluid his
O2 sats dropped and he was given an atrovent neb, his HR
increased to 180 and he was started on a dilt drip at 5mg/hr. On
transfer to the CCU he is [**Age over 90 **]-100% on NRB, HR 158, BP 139/118, T
102.7, RR 28.

PULSES:

Left: Carotid 2+  DP dopplerable PT dopplerable

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**7-22**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Tib/fib X-ray [**7-22**]:  No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.
.
CT torso [**7-23**]:
1. Airspace opacification at the right lung base with air
bronchogram, and
possible cavitation. Small right pleural effusion. Scattered
lymph nodes in mediastinum, with prominent lymph nodes in the
right hilum, could be reactive.
2. Enlarged kidneys with perinephric stranding.
3. Stable appearance of calcified splenic lesion.
4. Mass vs abscess, 4 x 4.3 cm size, in liver
.
RUQ U/S [**7-24**]:
1. Mixed echogenic lesion within the gallbladder fossa is
consistent with resolving hematoma as seen on prior CT scan from
one year ago.
2. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. Please note that
other more
severe forms of liver disease including significant hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded.
.
ECHO [**7-24**] (TEE)- No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No LA/LAA thromubs seen. No valvular vegetations
seen on the aortic, tricuspid or mitral valves. Moderate TR
seen.
.
RUQ U/S ([**7-24**])
1. Mixed echogenic lesion within the gallbladder fossa is
consistent with
resolving hematoma as seen on prior CT scan from one year ago.
2. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. Please note that
other more
severe forms of liver disease including significant hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis
cannot be excluded.
.
CXR [**7-24**]- There has been previous median sternotomy and coronary
bypass
surgery. New vascular congestion and left-sided interstitial
opacities
suggest worsening volume status of the patient. There remains
marked
elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, present dating back to
[**2153-2-22**]
chest radiograph, with adjacent atelectasis involving right
middle and right lower lobes. There is also a small right
pleural effusion.
.
CXR [**7-25**]: There is newly developed left lung consolidation that
given its rapid development is highly concerning for massive
aspiration. Rapidly progressing infection is unlikely. There is
no evidence of pulmonary edema. There is still high position of
right hemidiaphragm and stable appearance of cardiomediastinal
silhouette.
.
CXR ([**7-26**])- Slight interval improvement in the extensive left mid
and lower
lung consolidation, presumably related to massive aspiration,
stable large
right pleural effusion with new left lower lobe collapse.
.
CXR ([**7-28**])- There has been some clearing of the left opacities
since the two prior chest x-rays. Atelectasis of the right base
persists.
