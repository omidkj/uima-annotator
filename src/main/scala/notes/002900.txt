Chief Complaint:
Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58316**] is a 74M with hx of COPD, dCHF, HTN, recent admission
to [**Hospital3 3583**] for GI bleed, transfered from [**Hospital3 3583**]
after being admitted [**2185-4-25**] again for rectal bleeding. Patient
reported episodes of loose bowel movements mixed with blood
around 2pm on [**2185-4-25**]. He reports a toilet bowl full of bright
red blood that day, then two large melenotic stools the
following day, [**2185-4-26**]. He denied any chest pain, shortness of
breath, DOE, symptoms of orthostasis or presyncope. At OSH, he
was started on protonix drip and seen by Gastroenterology. His
Hct dropped to 26 (from 31), so he was transfused 1u pRBCs,
after which his Hct bumped appropriatedly to 29. EGD both last
month showed a visible pulsatile vessel in duodenum with no
ulcer, which underwent successful epinephrine injection and Endo
clip, and appeared to be at high risk for rebleed. During this
hospitalization, patient underwent repeat EGD on [**2185-4-26**] which
again showed pulsatile vessel with small clot on it, felt to be
arterial, no evidence of active bleeding, and it again responded
to epinephrine injection and was clipped with no further
bleeding. There was discussion with gastroenterology about
potential surgical treatment. When he was admitted last month,
he did admit to some lightheadedness and had noted both melena
and hematochezia.

Currently, patient feels well without complaints. He has not had
a bowel movement in 2 days.

ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria.

IMAGING & STUDIES:
EGD [**2185-5-2**]:
Impression: Schatzki's ring
Nodularity and congestion in the stomach compatible with
gastritis
A 2-3mm visible vessel was seen in the duodenal bulb. Gold probe
was applied for thermal therapy. The lesion then began to bleed
in a pulsatile manner. The lesion was injected with 8ccs of
epinephrine. An endoclip was applied in an attempt to achieve
hemostasis. There was residual oozing of bright red blood around
the area of the clip with poor visualization. With 2 additional
ccs of epinephrine the bleeding subsided. There was no clear
location in which to place an additional clip.
Angioectasias in the duodenal bulb
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

[**2185-5-2**] IR embolization imaging:
1.  No evidence of active arterial extravasation from the
gastroduodenal
artery or its branches on DSA arteriogram of the gastroduodenal
artery.
2.  Successful retrograde coil embolization of the
gastroduodenal artery,
resulting in occlusion/flow stasis.

[**2185-5-2**] Post line placement: R PICC in mid-SVC

LABS ON DISCHARGE:
[**2185-5-5**] 05:46AM BLOOD Hct-28.3*

Brief Hospital Course:
This is the brief hospital course of a 74 year-old male with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic diastolic heart
failure, hypertension, and recurrent GI bleeds who was admitted
this hospitalization from [**Hospital3 3583**] following a GI bleed.

Over the course of the first two hospital days at [**Hospital1 18**], the
patient did not have any bowel movements. On HD #3, he was noted
to have 2 frankly melanotic bowel movements. GI was consulted
and a plan was established to perform an EGD and colonoscopy the
following day, [**2185-5-2**]. During the procedure, the patient began
to demonstrate pulsatile bleeding from his presumed duodenal
artery that was not responsive to cauterization, epinephrine
injection, or clipping.

The patient was transferred to the MICU on HD #4 ([**2185-5-2**]) for
closer monitoring with plans to undergo IR embolization of the
bleeding artery at the next possible time. PICC line was placed
for better IV access. He successfully underwent IR-guided
retrograde coil embolization of the greater duodenal artery on
HD #5 ([**2185-5-3**]). After this his HCT remained stable around 28-29,
and he remained hemodynamically stable with no further episodes
of bleeding until his transfer back to the floor on [**2185-5-4**], HD
#6. He was kept overnight (to abide by 72 hour inpatient
regulations following active GI bleed) until [**2185-5-5**], HD #7, when
he was discharged home in good condition, with no evidence of
active bleeding. The patient's home PPI dose was increased to
40mg twice daily. He was given stool softeners to be taken at
home as needed.  He will follow up with his primary
gastroenterologist, who was informed of this course by the
inpatient GI team.

Additionally, IVs placed at [**Hospital3 3583**] in the patient's
RIGHT arm as well as one on the LEFT arm were infiltrated on his
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. Hot packs were used to alleviate pain and
sweliing. On the day of discharge, these were resolved.

INACTIVE ISSUES THIS ADMISSION:
# COPD
- duonebulizers were given prn

# Hypertension
- home amlodipine and atenolol were held as patient was
normotensive while in house, did not discharge on either
medication, will follow-up with PCP for restart

# Hyperlipidemia
- continued home simvastatin 20mg Qday

# Tobacco Use
- encouraged smoking cessation and offered nicotine patch
prescription

The patient was informed that he should still have a screening
colonoscopy performed as part of his regular health maintenance
in the near future as the studies done this admission were not
adequate for this screening.

Transitional Issues:
-Amlodipine and Atenolol were held at discharge.
-Patient will need screening colonoscopy in the future as he has
not had this.

Multivitamin
Simvastatin 20mg
omeprazole 20mg
