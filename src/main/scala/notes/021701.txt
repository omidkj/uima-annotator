History of Present Illness:
80 y/o French/Creole-speaking female with a hx of GI bleed,
recent diagnosis of HepC cirrhosis, grade I esophageal varices,
presents with melena and confusion. Recently was admitted for
SOB, melanotic stools, encephalopathy from [**Date range (1) **]. Due to
need for intubation for EGD her HCP deferred and she was managed
medically with ciprofloxacin for UTI and GIB, PPI and nadalol
when her BP stabilized. Endoscopy with banding was deferred for
outpatient managment. Per her daughter she was doing well at
home until Tuesday when she was becoming more lethargic and not
eating well. She refused her lactulose and didn't take any of
her other medications. She also had a productive cough but no
fevers or chills. She had dark stools since leaving the hospital
but the daughter thought this was due to the iron that she had
been giving her. She was noted to have increasing SOB and was
given more frequent nebulizer treatments. In ED, CXR showed
possible RLL PNA so she was given levofloxacin. Hct was at the
patients baseline but due to melena and confusion she was seen
by Liver. Liver recommended starting her on PPI gtt, octreotide
gtt, px antibiotics with plan for EGD tomorrow.Of note, an ECG
showed slightly worse TWI in v4-v6.

Brief Hospital Course:
80yo female h/o HCV cirrhosis and Grade 1 varices admitted with
change in mental status.  Guaic positive but Hct stable during
admission.  Initially in MICU for 48 hours without change in Hct
so sent to medical floor.

again on day of discharge) and patient asymptomatic.  Never
received octreotide; kept on IV PPI.  On nadolol with BP well
controlled.  Seen by liver team who felt conservative management
appropriate at this time.
-plan repeat cbc at home in 5 days and send to PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
seeing patient sooner if sig drop in Hct.
-did not transfuse to avoid raising intravasc volume and
stressing varicies (d/w liver team).

Patient intermittently complained of abdominal pain, but her
