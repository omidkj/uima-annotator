Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was hemodynamically stable in the CCU, although her
blood pressures were initially low.  She was transfused 1 unit
of PRBCs for anemia, likely due to volume loss.  She was
transfered to the floor on Post cath day 1 where she was
diuresed 2 Liters and was subsequently euvolemic.  She had
occasional episodes of desaturation with movement, for which she
received intermittent oxygen.  She had no acute episodes of
severe shortness of breath and was able to ambulate with her
walker on POD 2.Her left lower extremity was negative for a DVT.
Her TEE revealed mild-mod AS, and mild AR, MR, MS and normal
systolic ventricular function to be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
outpatient.
