Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mitral valve repair with quadrangular resection of posterior P2
leaflet and annuloplasty with [**Company 1543**] CG Future ring, model
number 638R, size 28 mm.


History of Present Illness:
52 year old female with a history of mitral valve prolapse who
presented to the OSH ED with chest pain radiating to right neck
and acute shortness of breath for 2 days- found to have CHF. An
EKG showed NSR. A [**4-4**] murmer was auscultated. A stat echo was
done that revealed a flail posterior MV leaflet with  4+ wide
open MR. She is currently on nitro @ 10mcg/min and nipride @
9ml. She was also given IV push 20mg lasix and 0.25mg IV ativan
and (4) 81mg Aspirin tablets. Blood Cultures were sent. The
patient is currently stable without chest
pain. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization which

Final Report
HISTORY: Mitral valve repair, to assess for change.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-7**], intact midline
sternal wires
are again seen. There is continued bilateral pleural effusion
with extensive
atelectatic changes at the bases. Some indistinctness of
pulmonary vessels is
suggestive of elevated pulmonary venous pressure in this patient
with a
prosthetic valve and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.

No AR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to40 cm
from the incisors.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The
mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is partial P2 mitral
leaflet flail with torn chords. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before surgical
incision.
Post_Bypass:
Preserved biventricualr systolic function.
Intact thoracic aorta.
There is a mitral annular ring, stable and well functioning with
transmitral mean gradient of 6 mm of Hg.
There is no mitral regurgitation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
