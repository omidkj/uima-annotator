CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

COMPARISON: None.

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Small atelectasis is present at the
lung bases. In addition, there is marked cardiomegaly and a very
small pericardial effusion. The liver enhances homogeneously
without focal lesions. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen,
adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys enhance and excrete
normally. A hypodense cyst is present within the lower pole of
the left kidney. There is a moderate hiatal hernia. No free air,
free fluid, or pathologic adenopathy is present in the abdomen.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a large ventral hernia
containing omentum and large bowel, without evidence for
incarceration. The small bowel loops are normal in caliber. The
rectum, sigmoid is remarkable for diverticular disease without
evidence for diverticulitis. No free air, free fluid, or
pathologic adenopathy is present in the pelvis. The distal
ureters and bladder are normal. The uterus is not identified.

Dissection flap is present along a 5-cm segment of infrarenal
abdominal aorta that terminates before the bifurcation of the
iliacs. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] opacifies clearly. There is no evidence for
mesenteric ischemia. Dissection does not involve the adrenals,
celiac, or SMA.

BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative disease is present throughout the
spine, but no suspicious lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. 5-cm infrarenal aortic dissection flap, with characteristics
suggesting a chronic etiology.
2. Large ventral hernia without evidence for incarceration.
3. Moderate hiatal hernia.
4. Cardiomegaly.

[**2156-8-2**] 11:30 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

PA AND LATERAL CHEST: There is stable severe cardiomegaly.
Enlarged right mediastinal contour is again noted. The pulmonary
vasculature is within normal limits. There are likely small
bilateral pleural effusions. The lungs are otherwise clear.
Minimal apical thickening is again seen on the right.
Degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly with probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
No overt CHF is identified.
2. Stable prominence of the right perihilar contour, which
likely represents mediastinal lymphadenopathy identified on the
prior chest CTA of [**2155-7-4**].




Brief Hospital Course:

intervention.

Aortic Aneurysm Symptoms

Aneurysms usually do not cause any symptoms until they become
very large or rupture. Aneurysms in the abdominal aorta are
often found coincidentally when the individual undergoes a
medical test or procedure for some other reason.

Chest pain and back pain are the 2 most common symptoms of large
aneurysms.

Almost any unusual sensation or feeling in the upper chest or
back, however, may be due to an aneurysm of the aorta.

Chest pain is usually the first sign of aortic dissection. Many
people describe a tearing or ripping pain in the chest when the
aorta enlarges to a critical size and ruptures/dissects. Besides
pain, increased sweating, a fast heart rate, rapid breathing,
dizziness, and shock may occur.

Some people describe the following symptoms of an aortic
aneurysm:

A pulsating bulge or a strong pulse in the abdomen

Feeling of fullness after minimal food intake

Nausea

Vomiting

Where the aorta widens into a bulge, blood clots (thrombi) are
more likely to form. If a piece of a blood clot breaks off, it
travels through the circulatory system until it lodges
somewhere. The clot can cut off blood flow to any area of the
body. Symptoms depend on which part of the body is deprived of
blood.

In the most serious cases, the broken off fragments can cause
stroke or heart attack. The fragments can also cause one or more
vital body organs, such as the lungs, liver, or kidneys, to stop
functioning properly.

In less serious cases, it might cause numbness, weakness,
tingling, pallor, or coldness in an arm or leg, loss of
sensation, light-headedness, or localized pain.

Any of these symptoms can also occur with dissection of the
aorta. The pain in the chest or pain may be particularly severe,
and may mimic a heart attack.

In ruptured aneurysm or dissection, internal bleeding will
occur. If you have any of these symptoms along with the other
symptoms of aortic aneurysm, you could be in danger and must
seek emergency medical care right away. Other symptoms include
the following:

Light-headedness

Confusion

Weakness

Shortness of breath

Rapid heart beat

Sweating

Numbness or tingling

Loss of consciousness (fainting)
