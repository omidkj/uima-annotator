History of Present Illness:
53 yo F w/ Hx of HTN and obesity s/p remote gastric bypass p/w
fever, altered mental status and hypoxia. Started having
headaches about one week ago and then yesterday had nausea and
vomiting and was noted by her husband to be less responsive.
About one week ago the pt. went to her PCP and was prescribed
tetracycline for a bump on her foot which was persistently
painful. Today her husband called home to check on her because
she did not go to work and she did not answer. Her daughter
found her unresponsive and unable to breath so called 911. She
was intubated at NWH and CT head showed diffuse edema w/ near
herniation. she was given acyclovir, CTX and vancomycin. She was
noted to be febrile there to 104F. At [**Hospital1 18**] she was difficult to
oxygenate, CXR showed ARDS and her PEEP was increased to 20 w/
100% FIO2 to maintain her oxygenation.
No specific sick contacts but pt. had been complaining about
being exposed to sick people at Shaws grocery store.
In the ED, initial VS: 137, 87/54 on neo 5, 100% on FIO2 100%
and PEEP of 20. on Versed 10mg/hr, fentanyl 25mcg/hr. CMV 100%,
400x22, PEEP 20. Overbreathing. Has L fem line, R IO,
peripherals.

Radiology
=============
CT Head [**12-18**]
Largely stable appearance of diffuse sulcal effacement and loss
of ambient
cisterns, consistent with diffuse brain edema. No new
intracranial hemorrhage or herniation.

RUQ u/s [**12-20**]
Extremely limited study due to body habitus.
Cholelithiasis with distended gallbladder. HIDA scan can be done
for further evaluation if clinically warranted.

CT Spine [**12-27**]
Technically very limited study. Pneumonic infiltrates in both
lungs, more evident on the right side. Right renal cystic mass.
Suboptimal
position of left central venous line.

CT Head [**12-27**]
No definite sign of a brain abscess. Please note that this study

is very insensitive in the detection of meningeal inflammatory
disease.
ADDENDUM: There is also mild atherosclerotic calcification of
the distal left vertebral artery at the level of the foramen
magnum


============
Cardiology
============
TTE [**12-20**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
top normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 20-30 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Neurology
==============
EEG [**12-23**]
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and
disorganization of the background rhythm with periods of
semi-rhythmic
generalized moderate to high voltage theta/delta activity at
times
concerning for sharp and slow wave activity. These findings
suggest a
moderate to severe encephalopathy with underlying cortical
irritability.
Medications, toxic/metabolic disturbances, and infection are
common
causes. Although no electrographic seizures were seen during
this
recording, the rhythmic theta/delta activity is concerning for
possible
development of seizure activity and would recommend continuous
video EEG
monitoring for further characterization and evaluation. Note is
made of
an irregular rhythm with frequent PVCs.

EEG [**12-26**]
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. Routine
sampling showed primarily an encephalopathic background but with
many
generalized frontally predominent sharp wave epileptiform
discharges.
These were seen in isolation rather than reptitively or in an
electrographic seizure. A single suspicious event occured at
13:00 on
the afternoon of [**12-25**]. This showed a sudden appearance of
alpha
frequency activity primarily in the right central parietal area
but with
spread to the left frontal region and with an increase in
frequency over
30 seconds. By video, this was associated with apparent
hyperventilation. This raises the possibility of a single
seizure.
Otherwise, there were frequent epileptiform sharp wave
discharges but no
clear seizures.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Encephalitis/meningitis: Severe cerebral edema on CT head. LP
was performed by IR that showed with 7000 WBCs, 1000RBCS protein
645, glucose 34. Opening pressure was 37 and bolt was placed
with initial ICP 25. Patient required mannitol and hypertonic
salien with improvement to 13. The following day ICPs were
stable around 10 and the ICU team stopped hypertonic saline and
manatol. Etiology felt to be likely bacterial meninigitis but
CSF did not grow bacteria because patient was started on
antibiotics prior to fluid collection. Patient received 2 week
course of vanco/cefepime/ampicillin. Bolt was placed by
neurosurgery to decompress on admission, which was removed on
[**12-23**]. On [**12-24**] patient was found to be seizing on EEG and
dilantin was started with a bolus followed by standing Q8 hour
dosing. Plan for patient to continue dilantin until she can
follow up with neurology as an outpatient. The patient had
persistent fevers which were felt to be due to VAP and dvt (see
below). CT spine and head were performed to rule out absess
which were negative, and patient as afebrile prior to transfer
to the medicine floor.

# Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for hypoxia intially
and weaning was somewhat limited by depressed mental status and
high peep requirements due to the patients body habitus. Also
complicated by VAP which was treated with an 8 day course (see
below). Patient was eventually extubated on [**12-31**] with 2 hour
transition to
