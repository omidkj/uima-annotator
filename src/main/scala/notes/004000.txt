Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2142-4-13**]

blood, and fluid. No large hemorrhage. No evidence of infarction


MR brain [**2142-4-13**]
Redemonstration of the right parietal lesion measuring 1.8 x 2.3
x 2.4 cm. for surgical planning. Other details as above

CT head noncontrast [**2142-4-13**]: Expected post biopsy changes of
pneumocephalus, small amount of blood, and fluid. No hemorrhage.
No evidence of infarction.

Chest Xray [**4-16**] : no change from [**2142-4-10**]. No focal
consolidation or pleural effusion is seen. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is within normal limits.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 55 year old man with history of metastaic lung CA
presents for open biopsy of R parietal brain lesion. Post
operative head CT was stable. He remained in the ICU overnight
for close monitoring. On [**4-14**], patient remained stable.
Overnight his blood glucose was elevated to 455 and an insulin
gtt was started. On the morning of [**4-14**], his gtt was weaned off
and patient was transferred to the SDU.  He had BS over 400
twice and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted on [**4-15**]. Steroids were lowered.
On [**4-16**] his dexamethasone continued to be weaned  and [**Last Name (un) **]
contined to see him titrating his sliding scale. On [**4-17**] he was
deemed fit from a neurosurgical perspective for discharge to
rehab, however after discussion with [**Last Name (un) **] he continued to
require more time to devise an appropriate blood glucose
management regimen so his discharge was placed on hold. He was
transferred to floor status on [**4-17**].

He was seen and evaluated by physical therapy and occupational
therapy who felt that he would benefit from rehab.

At the time of discharge he was tolerating a diabetic diet,
ambulating with a walker, afebrile with stable vital signs.
