Chief Complaint:
accelerating angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catherization

History of Present Illness:
47 yo male with history of extensive EtOH abuse with cirrhosis,
tobacco abuse, high cholesterol, HTn who was directly admitted
for cardiac catherization for accelerating anigina.  Pt has
reported exertional angina for several weeks that resolves with
rest, however over the past few days chest pain has become more
severe and present intermittently at rest thus prompting his
admission for PCI.  Cardiac catherization reveaked 3VD with 100%
RCA proximal lesion (good collaterals), 60% major marginal LCx
and 80% prox LAD for which he received a cypher 3x18mm stent
placed with angiomax administered.  Cath complicated by Pt
agitation on table with subsequent groin hematoma requiring
additional sedation with valium.  Pt subsequently transferred to
CCU for EtOH withdrawal management.  Upon arrival Pt HD stable,
without CP/SOB/HA/abd pain/N-V/dizziness/shakes but mentioning
pain at his foley site.

Cardiology Report C.CATH Study Date of [**2154-10-30**]

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed a normal LMCA.  The LAD had an 80% proximal lesion.  In
the LCx
system there was a 60% lesion in a large OM.  The RCA was
totally
occluded in its proximal portion.  The distal RCA was supplied
by large
bore collaterals from the LAD.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal central aortic
pressures.
3.  Successful stenting of the LAD was performed with a 3.25 x
18 mm
Cypher DES.
4.  Angioseal of the groin was performed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Stenting of the LAD.
3. Angioseal of groin.


Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo man with h/o EtOh abuse, high chol., Htn and +FHx admitted
with accelerating angina for catherization that showed 3VD
requiring DES to LAD.  Admitted to CCU for EtOH withdrawal
managment.

1) CAD: Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization for
accelerating angina.  Results of cath detailed above in results
section, but briefly showed 3VD with a 70% LAD lesion which was
stented.  Cath without complication.  Pt however became a bit
agitated in the cath lab requiring an additional dose of valium.
 Because of this and Pt's risk for EtOH withdrawal Pt was
transferred to the CCU for overnight monitoring.  Pt was
maintained on a BB and ASA, and started on Plavix.  Pt HD stable
and without CP overnight.  CE's never elevated and ECGs without
acute ischemic changes.  Pt recieved angomax during cath and
thus never started on Hep or Integrillin.  Pt discharged in the
morning with distinct instructions as to the importance of
taking both the ASA and plavix every day.  Pt is to follow up
with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] in one to two weeks.

2) Pump: Pt with a preserved EF. However upon arrival to the CCU
suffered from transiet hypotension that responded to 250cc NS
bolus.  Most likely secondary to drug received in cath lab.  Pt
hemodynamically stable the remaining of the night.

3) Rhythm: Pt maintained in NSR during hospitalization.

4) EtOH: Pt with extensive EtOH abuse history with a daily usage
of [**10-9**] beers.  Last drink was morning of admission.  Pt was
started on standing Ativan as well as PRN based on CIWA scale.
Pt did well overnight with overt signs of withdrawal and no DTs.
Pt given MVI/Folate/Thiamine and sent home with subsequent
prescriptions
