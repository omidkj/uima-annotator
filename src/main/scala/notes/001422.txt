PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. The right atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque
to 45 cm from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There
is severe valvular mitral stenosis (area <1.0cm2). Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid annulus is mildly dilated
(4.1 mm). There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is A-paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. There is a well-seated, well-functioning mechanical
valve in the mitral position. There is no mitral stenosis. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. No paravalvular leak is seen.
Bileaflet mechanical valve washing jets are present. There is a
tricuspid annuloplasty ring in place. There is trace tricuspid
regurgitation. There is no tricuspid stenosis (mean gradient of
2 mmHg). Aortic regurgitation is unchanged. Biventricular
function is unchanged. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
47 year old Spanish speaking male who was admitted to an OSH on
[**2103-7-17**] with progressive dyspnea on exertion,lower extremity
edema, and was treated for congestive heart failure with
diuresis and BIPAP. Cardiac echo was performed which revealed
severe Mitral Stenosis/ Mitral regurgitation and pulmonary
artery hypertension. Mr.[**Known lastname 77892**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation of surgical correction. [**2103-8-24**] cardiac cath was done
and revealed no coronary disease.  He was worked up for surgery
and diuresed for several days. He was taken to the operating
room on [**2103-8-28**] where he underwent mitral valve replacement, [**Street Address(2) 90956**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical
mechanical valve and tricuspid valve repair with a 28 mm
[**Company 1543**] Contour   annuloplasty ring. See operative note for
full details. He was brought out of the OR on multiple
vasoactive medications, including Vasopressin and Milrinone,
with high pulmonary artery pressures initially. He was weaned
from vasoactive medications and extubated on POD #2 without
incidence. He was started on Coumadin for mechanical valve and
Heparin was started on POD#3 until INR>3.5.  Pacing wires and
chest tubes were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.  He went
into atrial fibrillation post op day 4 and converted to sinus
rhythm on Amiodarone. Coreg and Lisinopril were started for
blood pressure control with low EF and these are to be titrated
by outpatient cardiologist. He was ambulating without
difficulty, tolerating a full oral diet and his incisions were
healing well on POD#7. He was given prescriptions for free care
medications and he is to have his INR checked at [**Hospital 487**]
Hospital with results called into the cardiac surgery office for
Coumadin dosing instructions until follow-up with his
cardiologist on [**9-20**].  His INR at discharge was 3.8.  He was
discharged home in stable condition. All follow up appointments
were advised.
