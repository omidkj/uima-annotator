Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Tetanus Antitoxin / Penicillins / Ethambutol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of COPD,
diastolic heart failure, who was recently admitted for
pneumonia, DM II, and aortic stenosis who presented with three
days of cough.  Initially, the cough was productive of sputum
(unknown color) but for the past 24 hours before admission,
cough was dry.  She denied any fever, sore throat, body aches,
sinus congestion or any change in her breathing. She received a
flu shot this year.
On review, patient denied any chest pain or peripheral edema.
.
In the ED, she was treated with albuterol & ipratroprium bromide
nebulizers, nitroglycerin x 2, aspirin 325 mg, lasix 40mg,
solumedrol 125 mg IV, and levofloxacin 500mg. A chest xray was
performed that revealed bronchiectasis in the upper lobe
lesions, with no areas of consolidation. Troponin was 0.01. EKG
showed LBBB pattern.
.
In the MICU, she was tachypneic.  She has been receiving
nebulizers and sputum cultures were positive for MRSA.  Patient
remained on levofloxacin and vancomycin was started on [**2197-2-3**].
Her oxygen saturations were 94% on 3 liters nasal canula.


Past Medical History:
--COPD: Last spirometry [**6-14**]: Results are consistent with a
restrictive ventilatory defect. FVC 66% of predicted; FEV1 68%
of predicted; FVC/FEV1 1.03. Results are consistent with a
restrictive ventilatory defect. Cannot rule out obstructive gas
trapping.
--Bronchiectasis: history of atypical mycobacteria on sputum
culture in [**2191**]- followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21848**].
--Hypertension:  On stable regimen on atenolol, hctz,
nifedipine.
Concern of CP in association with elevated blood pressure in
past.
--Aortic stenosis: ECHO in [**2195-4-10**]-The left atrium is mildly

dilated, left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. Mild aortic stenosis is present. Mild

(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Compared with the findings of

the prior study of [**2193-11-28**], there has been no significant
change.
--Cholelithiasis/cholangitis: Status post ERCP with
sphincterotomy/stent placement and removal (d/c summary [**5-13**]),
also s/p cholecystectomy.
--Diabetes

Social History:
Moved from the [**Location (un) 3156**] 26 years ago. Lives alone with home
services, where someone sees her every day. She uses a walker at
baseline. She is on home O2 (2L by NC). Denies current tobacco,
alcohol and illicit drug use. Smoked previously, quit in [**2175**].


Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
(on transfer):
VS: T 96.8, HR 57-77, BP 128-163/46, RR 18-29, O2sat: 92-97% on
3L nasal canula; I/O: 580/965, net:-385
GENERAL: Pleasant elderly Caucasian female who is quite anxious.
 Not using accessory muscles to breath.
SKIN: Warm and dry.
HEENT: Sclerae are anicteric, conjunctiva without injection,
MMM.  No cervical adenopathy. Purple lesion in left inner cheek.

NECK: No JVP, no adenopathy, no thyromegaly.
LUNGS: Crackles prominent in right lung, throughout.  Coarse
breath sounds.  Crackles at the bases.  Inspiratory wheezes
noted.
HEART: Regular with 3/6 holosystolic murmur at apex.
ABD:  Soft, with active bowel sounds throughout.  Tender in
right upper quadrant to deep palpation.
EXTREMITIES: Warm and well perfused.  No edema.  2+ peripheral
pulses.


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR ([**2197-2-4**]):  Mild vascular congestion developed between
[**1-31**] and 24, unchanged.  No pulmonary edema.  Pleural
effusion, if any, is minimal, on the right.  Heart size top
normal.  No consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  No
pneumothorax.
.
CTA ([**2197-1-31**]):  1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2.
Bibasilar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, which are somewhat decreased
since [**3-9**], [**2196**], but may represent an indolent infection.  3.  Prominent
central pneumobilia, incompletely evaluated, of uncertain
etiology.
.
ECHO ([**2197-1-31**]):  EF 60-70%.  The left atrium is normal in size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened.  There is moderate to severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2196-2-1**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has
increased slightly and estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressures are higher.
.
V/Q scan ([**2197-1-31**]):  Severely limited study secondary to lack of
a ventilation study.  Bilateral segmental defects are
indeterminate in etiology.
.
Chest Xray ([**2197-1-31**]): Allowing for differences in technique,
there has been near complete resolution of bilateral upper lobe
opacities from [**2196-12-7**]. Mild bronchiectasis in these regions
remain. There are no new areas of consolidation. The surrounding
soft tissue and osseous structures are stable.
.
cxr [**2-7**]: PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY: The cardiac silhouette,
mediastinal and hilar contours are normal and stable. The
pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no pneumothorax.
Reticulonodular opacities in bilateral lung apices, right middle
and lower lobes are stable and correspond with recent Chest CT,
consistent with chronic MAC. A tiny right pleural effusion is
slightly smaller than on prior exam. No new consolidations are
noted. The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures are
stable.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in the appearnace of
the chest. Multifocal reticulonodular opacities are stable,
consistent with known chronic MAC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of COPD, diastolic
heart failure, diabetes, aortic stenosis, who has been recently
admitted for pneumonia presents with an exacerbation of COPD and
MRSA poitive pneumonia.  On transfer, being transferred on
vancomycin and levofloxacin.
.
1) Dyspnea: The patient presented with dyspnea and was
ininitally in the MICU as she was tachypneic. She had a cta and
VQ scan and was ruled out for PE.  The patient was initially
treated with levofloxacin, and with MRSA sputum cultures
positive, vancomycin was added.  She was stable and transferred
to the floor and continued on levofloxacin (started on [**1-31**]) and
vancomycin (started on [**2-3**]).  In addition to her infection the
patient has known COPD and rhonchorous and wheezing on
examination.  She was treated with nebulizers and steroids.  As
she improved her steroids were tapered.  Given her long-standing
respiratory history she will have close follow-up with her
pulmonologist as an outpatient.
.
2) Hypertension:  The patient was initially hypertensive during
the intial part of hospitalization requiring nitro gtt.  As her
blood pressure improved she was started on imdur, hydral,
metoprolol, and nifedipine, given the difficulty in controlling
her pressure with single agents.  Her pressures continued to be
elevated and she was given increased doses of nifedipine and
hydral.  At discharge her blood pressure was well-controlled on
multiple agents
