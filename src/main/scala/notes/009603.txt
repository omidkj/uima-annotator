Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro: Ms. [**Known lastname 36081**] came in with a central cord syndrome after a
fall at home. She was placed on a solumedrol now off all
steroids. She was placed in a hard cervical collar and must keep
it on for 12 wks with 2 wk f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (flex/ext. films at
that time). She was transfused with fresh frozen plasma and
given vitamin K to keep her INR around 1.3. It remained stable
during her hospitalization around 1.3-1.5. Her platelets
remained above 50, usually between 60-70, so no interventions
were necessary from that standpoint.

Heme: Ms. [**Known lastname 36081**] continued to be pancytopenic during her stay.
She was transfused with PRBCs and FFP during her stay per
neurosurgery recommendations as above. Per her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] WBC
is 3 with about 120 platelets. She has received multiple
transfusions and often gets fluid overloaded. It was thought
that the pancytopenia may be due to alcohol use but MDS could
not be omitted as an etiology without a bone marrow biopsy. This
procedure may be done during outpatient followup since it would
change prognosis. The patient was maintained on thiamine and
folate as well. She left with rising white and platelet counts.

Pulm: Ms. [**Known lastname 36081**] developed the onset of a cough productive of
sputum during her course as well as dyspnea with falling oxygen
saturations and a chest x ray with right sided opacities. She
improved with chest PT, a 10 day course of levofloxacin and
flagyl, and 2 L of O2 by nasal cannula. She was thought to have
developed an aspiration pneumonia or a pneumonitis since she
failed her speech and swallow evaluation. The patient was placed
on aspiration precautions and a nectar thickened diet. Her
physical exam has improved, now with fewer crackles at the
bases.

CV: Following transfusions, Ms. [**Known lastname 36081**] developed CHF with a
troponin leak and some EKG changes such as inverted t waves in
leads V3 + V4, consistent with ischemia. She could not be give
heparin or aspirin with PMH of HIT and with spinal cord
compression from hematoma. Before these events, she had an echo
which showed an EF of 40-45%. She's been rate controlled with
beta blockade and had bp control with lisinopril. She was
diaresed with lasix to improve her active CHF but then developed
hypernatremia. Following infusion of D5W, her hypernatremia
resolved. Once stabilized from the heme/neuro standpoint she
will be a candidate for catheterization so stress and echo may
be indicated as follow up.

Renal: Ms. [**Known lastname 36081**] has acute renal failure with a [**Known lastname 5348**] around
2 per PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] discharge, her creatinine was improving at 1.4.

GI: I spoke with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 5217**] who stated that Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 36082**] is a
chronic GI bleeder who has undergone multiple endocscopies and
colonoscopies to repair several angiodysplasias. He agreed with
current management.

Discharge Condition:
good

Discharge Instructions:
Be sure to eat a nectar thickened diet. No thin liquids. Please
have another speach and swallow evaluation once your collar is
removed.
Watch closely for leg swelling, shortness of breath, or chest
pain. Once patient eats and drinks more, she will need to be
restarted on her 20 mg. PO of lasix per day if her electrolytes
are stable. Please check a chem 7 in 5 days since she has been
hypernatremic.
Your INR and platelets should be checked in 5 days. The INR
should be less than 1.3 and the platelets should be greater than
50.

Followup Instructions:
Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 36083**] to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5217**] in 2
weeks. (I was unable to reach his office to make this
appointment for you.) He may want to schedule you for a stress
test and echocardiogram since you had some ischemic looking EKG
changes.
Please call Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 88**] to schedule a follow up visit
within 2 weeks. He will need flexion and extension films prior
to your visit and this is to be scheduled by his office.
