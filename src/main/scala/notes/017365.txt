CT C-spine [**8-1**]:
No acute fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine. Diffuse
osteopenia.

Right hip/femur/tib-fib films [**8-1**]:
Oblique comminuted fracture of the distal femur. No clear
intra-articular extension noted. Suboptimal visualization of the
tibial plateau as above. Severe profound osteopenia.

Right femur intra-op [**8-3**]:
35 fluoroscopic images of the right femur are submitted for
dictation. The total intraservice time of 181 seconds. These
demonstrate interval placement of a large lateral fracture plate
with multiple associated
cortical screws. This is fixating an obliquely oriented fracture
through the right distal femoral metaphysis. There are no signs
for hardware-related complication. Inferior portion of the
femoral prosthetic stem is visualized. Please refer to the
procedure note for additional details.

CXR [**8-2**]:
There is a small left pleural effusion. Calcification of the
mitral annulus. The right hilum is prominent and it is unclear
if this is
projectional or due to vascular engorgement. A hilar mass cannot
be totally excluded. Recommend followup. There is pulmonary
vascular re-distribution suggesting an element of fluid
overload. Compared to the prior study the right hilar prominence
and fluid overload are increased.

CXR [**8-4**]:
Slight improvement of left pleural effusion; hypoinflation but
no discrete consolidation.

Video swallow [**8-5**]:
1. Retention of solids/thick liquids in valleculae.
2. Aspiration of thin liquids.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Right Distal Femoral Fracture:  Patient underwent open
reduction and internal fixation.  Her right leg was placed in a
brace.  Pain was initially controlled with a hydromorphone PCA,
although there was concern for patient's ability to comply with
PCA.  She was changed to around-the-clock tylenol with morphine
IR PO as needed for breakthrough pain.  She was discharged on
lovenox 40 mg SC daily for two weeks per orthopedics
recommendations.

2. Hypotension:  Occurred post-op in the setting of hypovolemia
from blood loss while receiving antihypertensive medications and
hydromorphone for pain.  She received 5 units packed red blood
cells total, 1 unit fresh frozen plasma.  Although her
hematocrit was initially not responding to transfusion, it
stabilized and then continued to trend up.  Once stable, she was
restarted on enoxaparin SC, clopidogrel, and all her outpatient
BP meds except clonidine patch.  Her BP was controlled, although
clonidine can be restarted as an outpatient if necessary.

3. Fever/Leukocytosis:  Felt most likely due to systemic
response to her leg trauma.  She was initially started on
vancomycin and cefepime empirically, although these were later
stopped as she remained stable.  Her fevers and leukocytosis
gradually defervesced.

4. Hypoxia:  Patient was maintained on O2 via NC initially.  She
did not appear to be volume overloaded on exam, CXR showed no
discrete consolidation.  Her oxygen was weaned without
difficulty.  Possible explanation is atelectasis / shallow
breathing in perioperative period.

6. Dispo:  All of the patient's other chronic medical issues
were treated per her outpatient regimen with exceptions as noted
above.  Patient had her code status changed from DNR/I to full
code for her ORIF.  Afterward, code status was addressed with
the patient and her [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3707**].  It was agreed to
resume DNR/I code status.  Based on aspiration risk and video
swallow
