CCU for management of elevated PCWP and severe low-output heart
failure.

Pertinent Results:
[**2114-1-7**] Liver U/S - Gallbladder wall thickening without other
signs to suggest cholecystitis.  Clinical correlation is
recommended to exclude other etiologies for gallbladder wall
thickening such as hypoalbuminemia, CHF or hepatitis.
.
[**2114-1-8**] Echo - LVEF<20%. Severe LV dilation. Severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with septal and apical akinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. An LV
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. RV cavity is dilated. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. 1+AR, 2+MR, mod. PA HTN.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2114-1-9**] GB Scan - 1. No evidence of acute cholecystitis.2
Delayed uptake of tracer into the hepatic parenchyma consistent
with hepatocellular dysfunction. 3. Delayed tracer emptying into
the small bowel.
.
[**2114-1-12**] EGD - Erythema and congestion in the antrum compatible
with gastritis Erythema and congestion in the first part of the
duodenum compatible with duodenitis Otherwise normal EGD to
second part of the duodenum.
.
[**2114-1-25**] CT Abd - Ascites within the abdomen. Cardiomegaly.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. Degenerative changes with
cystic changes seen in the right femoral head. Superior
displacement of the femoral head.  These findings may be
post-traumatic or post- infectious in etiology. Dedicated hip
films are recommended.
.
[**2114-1-27**] Renal transplant u/s - 1. Stable appearance of the
right kidney without evidence of hydronephrosis or perirenal
collection. Patent renal vessels as described above. 2. Moderate
ascites.
.
[**2114-1-31**] Cath - 1. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly
elevated left and right sided filling pressures.  The mRA
pressure was 20 mmHg and the mean PCWP was 35-42 mmHg. The
cardiac output and cardiac index were significantly reduced at
3.5 l/min and 1.5 L/min/m2, respectively. There was reactive
pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary vascular resistance was 160
dynes.sec/cm2). FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Severe low output heart
failure.
.
[**2114-1-31**] CXR - Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. There is no
longer any pulmonary edema. Transvenous pacer defibrillator lead
is unchanged in position with the tip projecting over the floor
of the right ventricle and the proximal electrode spanning the
superior vena cava and upper right atrium. A right internal
jugular line passes to the region of the pulmonary outflow
tract, but the tip is indistinct. There is no pneumothorax or
mediastinal widening. The left lateral aspect of the lower chest
is excluded from the examination. Lungs are grossly clear.
.
[**2114-2-5**]: CXR - Persistent Cardiomegaly. Cardiac pacer leads are
in good position. The lung fields are clear. There are no
pleural effusions. Note that the left CP sulcus is not included
in the film. IMPRESSION: Persistent cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 47yoM with ESRD secondary to glomerulonephritis, s/p kidney
transplant x 2 ([**2089**], [**2097**]) s/p MI, VF-arrest, cath/stent and
stroke in [**2105**], recent history of left olecranon bursitis,
admitted for AV-fistula repair, and also for w/[**Location 14755**]
nausea/abd pain and diarrhea.
.
The patient reported a 4 month history of chronic abdominal
pain.  He had an extensive workup including HIDA/EGD/GB u/s all
of which have been unrevealing.  The GI team followed the Pt.
and wanted to get a CTA to look for mesenteric ischemia.  He was
given n-acetylcysteine and bicarbonate to preserve his renal
function.  During administration of the contrast, it infiltrated
into his arm and the study could not be completed.  A plastics
consult was called to r/o compartment syndrome.  The r
