IMAGING STUDIES:  Right upper quadrant ultrasound in
Emergency Room:  Gallbladder normal without evidence of
stones, small amount of sludge present, no intrahepatic or
common bile duct dilatation, no hydronephrosis, no acute
cholecystitis, however, there were diffuse fatty infiltrates
throughout the liver.  Chest x-ray:  Slight congestive heart
failure.  CT of abdomen:  No pericholecystic fluid,
attenuation of inferior wall, no stones, no cholangitis,
inconsistent with cholecystitis; also right lung atelectasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The plan for this 55 year old woman with
multiple problems was to admit for further workup given her
elevated liver function tests, which are consistent with
possible biliary obstruction versus acute hepatitis secondary
to other cause.  Viral hepatitis serologies were taken and
came back negative.  A gastroenterology consult for possible
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was called and
she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics, including
gentamicin and clindamycin.  Blood cultures were sent and the
[**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center was consulted for insulin
recommendations.

The patient was admitted to the internal medicine service
under Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 16901**], [**Location (un) **] Firm, and was given intravenous
fluids, given nothing by mouth and given Compazine and her
admission medications excluding medications for gout.  She
was placed on gentamicin, Flagyl and clindamycin for broad
spectrum antibiotic control, and was given two units of fresh
frozen plasma, considering possible endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography.

On [**2177-1-23**], the patient was seen by the [**Last Name (un) **]
attending, who made recommendations of U-500 insulin and
tailored the sliding scale according to her nothing by mouth
status.  She was also seen by gastroenterology service, who
recommended to proceed with an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography.

An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was
performed later that evening, on [**2177-1-23**].  A limited
examination of the esophagus was normal.  A limited
examination of the stomach was normal.  A limited examination
of the duodenum was also normal.  Major papilla was normal.
Cannulation was successful and contrast medium was injected,
revealing moderate diffuse dilatation of the biliary tree.
There were filling defects that appeared like sludge in the
common bile duct.  Following cannulation, discharge of sludge
and pus was seen at the ampulla.  The impression was
suppurative cholangitis with biliary dilatation with sludge.
The procedure was plastic stent placement.  Recommendations
included continued hospital stay with continuing intravenous
antibiotics and repeat liver function tests.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.

On [**2177-1-24**], the patient was afebrile and
hemodynamically stable.  She still had some right upper
quadrant tenderness and was kept on nothing by mouth until
follow-up liver function tests were back.  She was kept on
intravenous gentamicin and oral Flagyl at this time and was
continued to be followed by [**Last Name (un) **] attendings.

On [**2177-1-25**], the patient was subjectively unchanged,
though complaining of right upper quadrant pain and
tenderness.  Gastroenterology recommended performing a HIDA
scan, which was done on [**2177-1-25**].  The HIDA scan
showed a nonfilling gallbladder with positive enhancing of
the liver.  Surgery was notified at this time.  Surgery
examined the patient on [**2177-1-25**] and noted right
upper quadrant tenderness with guard
