CC:[**CC Contact Info 39484**].
HPI: 84 yo F with h/o afib on coumadin, MVR, COPD, HTN who was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] today with SOB thought to be secondary to CHF
and PNA.  She was transfered to the MICU after becoming hypoxic,
diaphoretic, and hypotensive requiring intubation and a levophed
gtt.
.
During the code, patient was found to have be in respiratoy
distress using accessory muscles to breath after eating dinner.
BP was unable to be obtained with dopplers.  She had strong b/l
femoral pulses.  A right IJ was unsuccessful; a right fem line
was placed.  She was started on a levophed gtt, intubated, and
transfered to the MICU.
.
As per the chart, she presented to the ED with progressive SOB,
intermittent right sided chest pain, and an occasional
productive cough.  She denied fevers/chills. Pt reported
orthopnea, DOE, and LE swelling worse than baseline.  At
baseline she ambulates with a walker.
.
In the ED patient received CTX/Azithro, Solumedrol 125 IV, Dilt
10 IV, ASA 325. She was noted to be in aflutter at a rate of
140s, that improved with dilt 10 IV x1.  She received an
additional 2 doses of lasix 20 mg IV.

Studies:

CXR [**2145-2-20**]: Mild CHF, b/l pleural effusions R>L, RLL
consolidation, flattened diaphragms
.
EKG: aflutter 150, no st/t changes
.
Echo [**2143-2-18**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is
present. The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.  Mitral
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified (likely normal
for this prosthetic valve).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  84 yo F with AF, MVR on coumadin, COPD with acute
respiratory distress and hypotension requiring intubation and
levophed.
.
#  Hypoxic Respiratory distress. After evaluation and triage in
the ED, she arrived on the inpatient floor without respiratory
distress satting well on 2LNC.  Approximately three hours later
she developed acute respiratory distress, the differential
included aspiration event, but later was demonstrated to have
low risk for aspiration by speech and swallow, a flash pulmonary
edema from ischemia or tachycardia (ECG with new symmetric
lateral TWI's), CAP (RLL consolidation with effusion), PE
(however this seems unlikely given INR of 10; and negative LE
dopplers) stroke.  In the unit she was started on vancomycin.
She was kept on ventilator and on levophed in the unit for one
day only. She has responded well to antibiotics, lasix prn, and
has remained afebrile with good O2 sats on 2LNC. Repeat CXR
showed bilateral infiltrates. A cardiac echocardiagram indicated
that she did have a decreased LVEF of 30-35%, which may have
contributed to her shortness of breath.  She was stabilized and
transferred back to the floors, she was treated with levaquin,
for a community acquired pneumonia, a viral nasal aspirate was
negative for influenzae, urine legionella was also negative.
Her oxygen requirements were slowly tapered and she required 2L
of oxygen at time of discharge to rehabiliation.  She was to
finish a 10 day course of antibiotics for presumed pneumonia.

.
#  Hypotension.  On transfer to the floor she developed acute
hypotension, the differential included sepsis, cardiogenic shock
from ischemia, and adrenal insufficiency a code was called and
she was transferred to the MICU. She was pancultured without
growth, an echocardiagram indicated wall motion abnormalities,
and a decreased LVEF,  her cardiac enzymes were cycled with a
slight elevation of troponins at 0.03. She was not
anticoagulated as her INR was 10 and there was concern for DIC.
She was initially maintained on levophed, but weaned off without
difficulty, her blood pressures remained stable for the rest of
her hospital course.  She was initially treated with diltiazem
while in the ICU but she was changed to metoprolol for blood
pressure control and rate control as she was shown to have a
decreased EF.  Her heart rate increased to the 120s on
metoprolol and her blood pressures could not tolerate increase
of metoprolol with SBP in the 110s, thus diltiazem was reapplied
and titrated upwards while tapering off the metoprolol. There
may be indication at rehab to attempt to add an ace inhibitor
and continue the diltiazem for rate control, as this was suspect
in her acute hypotensive decompensation.
.
#  Coagulopathy.  Her INR was elevated on admission with an INR
of 10.  This was thought to be associated with compliance as she
has had multiple admission with elevated INRs.  She was given
FFP and vitamin K to reverse the coagulopathy.  After
stabilization of her hypotension and return to the floor, she
was restarted on heparin for MVR prophylaxis, and her outpatient
coumadin was restarted for a goal of INR [**3-12**]. Her INR was 1.1 at
time of discharge with instructions to titrate coumadin for a
goal of INR [**3-12**].  She was to be maintained on a heparin sliding
scale until her coumadin was therapeutic

.
#  CKK- Her creatine remained at her baseline during this
dmission.
.
#  AFib- She has a history of atrial fibrillation, which during
the course of hypotensive code and transfer to the unit evolved
to atrial flutter.  She was rhythm controlled with diltiazem and
she remained atrial fibrillation, her cardiac medications were
converted from diltiazem to metoprolol to better address her CHF
but her heart rate increased and thus she was titrated back to
diltiazem.
.
#  Mechanical MV. Initially her INR of 10, she was given FFP and
vitamin K, and her INR normalized.  She was restarted on
heparin, and her coumadin was restarted, please see coagulopathy
for further detail
.
#  COPD.  This likely contributed to respiratory distress, she
was sym
