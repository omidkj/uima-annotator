Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cath
pulmonary stent

History of Present Illness:
44yo gentleman with h/o recently discovered pulmonary malignancy
presenting with dyspnea x 2 days.

The patient reports that he has had several weeks of air hunger.
Symptoms are worse with exertion and not particularly noticable
at rest. Two days ago, he woke up in the morning and was feeling
much more trouble breathing. Although he has reported chest
pressure to other interviewers, he is currently denying recent
chest pain or pressure. He has not had a cough or hemoptysis. He
denies orthopnea or PND. No weight gain, though he has had LE
edema that comes and goes. He denies fevers/chills. Of note, he
has had sweats and weight loss of 25 pounds over the last 6
weeks.

In the ED the patient had the following vital signs: 97.4 117/73
130 26 96%RA. Patient was found to have ST elevations and
borderline Q waves in V4-V6 and I and aVL. Pt also with subtle
ST elevations in V2-V3. The patient underwent CTA, which
preliminarily was negative for PE or aortic pathology. A bedside
echo was done, which preliminarily revealed mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 40-45%) with hypokinesis of
the mid inferospetal and apical septal walls as well as moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The patient was given ASA 325mg PO
ONCE, heparin gtt, nitro gtt, integrillin, and Plavix 600mg.

The patient was then rushed to the cath lab, where he was found
to have completely clean coronary arteries. The cath was also
notable for marked pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of
60/27. Because of the marked pulmonary pressures and clean
coronaries, a pulmonary angiogram was done, which was also
negative for obvious pulmonary embolism, but subsegmental PE
could not be excluded. Because of the patient's anemia, he was
given 1 unit of PRBCs and transferred to the CCU for intensive
monitoring.

In the CCU, the patient feels mildly short of breath and appears
in mild respiratory distress. He is mainly complaining of back
pain, which is chronic and from metastatic disease per the
patient.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2133-2-22**]   Radiology CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/CONTRAST
1. L4 pathological fracture, with mild-to-moderate loss of
vertebral height
and 4 mm retropulsion into the central canal. If the patient
presents with
neurologic signs and symptoms, MRI lumbar spine can be performed
to further
assess.
2. Bilateral adrenal nodules, incompletely assessed in the
current study.
Ill-defined right hepatic hypodensity lesion, also incompletely
assessed.
Dedicated MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 44394**] CT study could be performed for
further
characterization.
3. No intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy.
4. New small left pleural effusion. Interval subtotal LLL and
partial RLL
atelectasis. New RML ground-glass opacity concerning for
infectious process.

[**2133-2-21**]   Radiology MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of parenchymal metastases.

Predominantly right-sided pachymeningeal thickening of uncertain
etiology.
This could be seen in the setting of recent LP. Differential
diagnostic
considerations include neoplastic or inflammatory etiologies.

Multiple tiny presumed bilateral acute and subacute embolic
infarcts
predominantly supratentorially, although a few cerebellar
lesions are also
seen. None of these lesions has significant mass effect.
