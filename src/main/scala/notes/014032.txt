Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
89-year-old female with past medical history of left hip
replacement on [**2177-4-7**] at NEBH, and transferred to [**Hospital 100**] rehab
on [**4-11**] now presents with hypoxia.
.
Per documentation, patient had uneventful hospital course except
for hypertension for which she was transiently on clonidine and
now on norvasc, and fluid retention for which she was placed on
lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] and just transitioned to lasix 20 daily yesterday.
At rehab today patient was noted to be hypoxic to 70s on RA. EMS
was called and she was noted to be saturating in low 80s on RA.
She was started on 5L and improved to 93% and transferrred to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
Patient feels generally well, but noticed some mild SOB at rest
this morning. She also reports a nonproductive cough for
"several days". She denies Chest pain, fever, nausea, vomitting,
palpitations, orthopnea, and PND.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were 98.2, 155/73, 85, 16, 87 RA.
EKG was unremarkable. CXR showed bilateraly effusions, with a
small consolidation on the right. CTA was negative for PE, but
did show large effusions. On the way back from CT, patient
desaturated to low 90s on 5L NC. She received 40 mg of Lasix IV
and put out 1.5 L. She was placed on a NRB and saturations
improved to the mid 90s. She received Ceftriaxone 1 g IVx1,
Azithromycin 500 mg IV x1, and tylenol. On transfer, VS were 86,
135/79, 98 NRB.
.
In the ICU, patient was not given additional Lasix as had
recieved 40 mg IV once in ED. Given rapid improvement from NRB
to 3L NC, was thought to be safe to transfer to the regular
medical floor.
.
Upon interviewing, patient states she 'feels horribly' and her
'whole body hurts'. This has been ongoing for 6 months since
[**Month (only) **] when she had her knee replaced. She thinks the source
of her pain is arthritis and she's now 'racked' with pain and
she take 'too many pain killers'. Can't say if breathing is
better as is too distracted by pain.
.
Review of systems:

(-) Denies fever, chills. Denies headache, sinus tenderness,
rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies wheezing. Denies chest pain,
chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies rashes or skin

STUDIES:
EKG ([**4-12**]): Sinus rhythm with prolonged P-R interval.
Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes. No previous
tracing available for comparison.
.
CXR ([**4-12**]): 1. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
2. Bibasilar opacities, possibly atelectasis, but cannot exclude
infection.
3. Mild prominence of pulmonary vasculature, likely indicating
mild pulmonary congestion.
.
CTA chest ([**4-12**]): 1. No pulmonary embolism seen.
2. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions, with
adjacent relaxation atelectasis bilaterally.
3. Old rib fractures.
.
CXR ([**4-13**]): Bibasilar opacities corresponding to areas of
atelectasis on recent CT, with some improvement on the left.
Bilateral small pleural
effusions.
.
TTE ([**4-14**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Doppler parameters are
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with mild symmetric LVH and
hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Probable diastolic
dysfunction. Calcified mitral and aortic valve without
significant stenosis or regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
89-year-old female s/p hip replacement on [**2177-4-7**] who presents
with hypoxia.
.
# Hypoxia/Pleural effusions: CXR showed bilateral pleural
effusion, BNP elevated, consistent with volume overload.
Patient's hypoxia improved rapidly s/p 40 mg IV Lasix. She
recently had decreased Lasix as outpatient but unclear why newly
needed Lasix s/p hip replacement. Patient was ruled out for MI.
CTA ruled out PE.  Patient underwent TTE which showed diastolic
dysfunction, EF>75%.  Patient was put on 20mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **], and
her oxygen saturation was in high 90s on room air during the
rest of her hospital stay.  Patient was discharged on lasix 20mg
[**Hospital1 **].
.
# Hypertension:  Patient's bp was high, sbp in the 180s, so
amlodipine was increased from 5mg to 10mg daily.  Her BP was
better controlled after this dose change.
.
# S/p hip replacement: Pain was well controlled with standing
tylenol and oxycodone prn. Celebrex was discontinued.  Patient
was continued on coumadin for anticoagulation.  The original
plan from OSH was to treat her for 4-6 weeks post-op (surgery
was [**4-7**]).
.
# EKG changes: Q waves were seen in III/AVF, and patient had
evidence of heart failure on exam.  Question whether patient had
a previous cardiac event.  Fasting lipids and HbA1c were checked
which were wnl. TTE showed hyperdynamic LV with EF>75%. Patient
was continued on statin.
.
# Anemia: Normocytic, admission hct 33.5. Suspect
