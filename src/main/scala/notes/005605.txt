History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yo female with HTN, DM, Breast CA on arimidex,
OSA, s/p trach in [**2089**], diastolic CHF, S/p CVA, who was
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] 3 weeks ago after tongue bleed in setting
of supratherapeutic INR and CHF exacerbation.  She was
discharged to rehab where she was not getting lasix.  She has
noted increased lower extremity edema over the past few days.
She has had thick yellow secretions lately as well. She endorses
subjective fevers at rehab.  She was noted yesterday to desat
and was given lasix 20 and nebs with some improvement.  She
desatted again today and was given 40 po of lasix and got a CXR
which showed CHF and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for furhter
management.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, her initial vs were 134/70, 98.5, RR20,
98% on 8L. She got a CXR which showed CHF but could not rule out
bibasilar infiltrates.  SHe was suctioned yellow secretions and
desatted to 87% during suctioning.  There were concerned she
might need to be vented, so was admitted to the MICU.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient was satting 100% on 35%TCM
(her baseline).  She denied symptoms of shortness of breath.
She reports her LE edema improved since yesterday.  Patient
reports right sided abdominal discomfort secondary to being
hungry.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 yo female with diastolic CHF, s/p trach, HTN, DM,
A. fib on coumadin, here with CHF exacerbation.

1. Hypoxia / Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  The patient was
initially admitted to the ICU on [**3-12**] with desaturations with
evidence of CHF on CXR and an elevated BNP.  She was diuresed
with IV lasix and rapidly improved to normal saturations of
around 100% on 35%TCM (her baseline) with subjective improvement
in her lower extremity edema.  She was subsequently transferred
to the floor.

On the floor over the weekend, the patient was able to weaned to
FiO2 of 50% on TCM, tolerating Lasix diuresis.  On Sunday,
creatinine increased; Lasix was decreased to 40 mg PO from 40 mg
IV.

Overnight, on the day of transfer, the patient triggered when
she was noted to be hypoxic to the 80s when her trach mask had
fallen off.  She was suctioned and FiO2 on trach mask was
increased to 100% with immediate improvement.  However, given
new lethargy, an ABG was drawn: 7.33/93/84.  Lasix was given
over concern that she had only rec'd one dose of PO lasix in the
morning.  CXR was underpenetrated but showed continued pulmonary
edema without any clear evidence of infiltrate.  The patient
appeared to wake more, and repeat ABG was 7.31/94/111.  At that
time, MICU was called to evaluate.  On arrival, the patient was
alert, awake and asking to go to the bathroom.  She was able to
use the commode without much difficulty.  However, on returning
to bed, she became somnolent, but easily arousable.  Continued
to be able to follow commands.  Repeat ABG was 7.37/89/73 on
FiO2 of 70%.  Her mental status continued to wax and wane which
was a difference from baseline, so she was transferred back to
the MICU for further evaluation.  Eventually it was felt that
her hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory failure was largely due
to a significantly elevated HCO3 (49), likely renal compensation
for her severe contraction alkalosis from diuresis.  She was
treated with potassium chloride, arginine chloride, and diamox
with improvement in both her serum HCO3 and CO2 levels, as well
as her overall mental status.  Eventually the patient may
require intermittant nocturnal ventillation to help her CO2 from
rising in the setting of her OSA and obesity hypoventillation
syndrome.  The patient remained afebrile during her hospital
course and repeated investigations into potential infectious
causes for her hypoxia were negative.  The patient continued to
receive albuterol and atrovent nebs as well.  The patient would
benefit from continued pulmonology follow-up as an outpatient.

2.  Anemia.  At baseline.  Most recent anemia studies in
[**Month (only) 1096**] consistent with iron deficiency anemia.  Prior
colonoscopy shows diverticulosis.  The patient was given iron
supplementation and her hematocrits were monitored.

3.  Hypernatremia.  The patient had a mildly elevated serum
sodium.  She was encouraged to drink free water.

4.  Renal failure.  The patient has a fluctuating baseline, but
her creatinine was generally in the 1.2-1.3 range.  However, it
did rise acutely to 1.6 on [**3-17**] and this increase was felt to be
secondary to volume depletion and dehydration from aggressive
diuresis as she was simultaneously oliguric.  She was gentley
bolused IVF and her creatinine trended downward thereafter.

5.  CAD.  On admission the patient had a positive tropnonin with
normal ck, likely demand in setting of renal dysfunction.  There
were no acute ekg changes.  She was ruled out for an MI and
continued on simvastatin.

6.  Thrombocytopenia.  Unclear etiology, but the patient has had
a precipitous decline over the last few weeks.  This decrease
may be secondary to a medication  effect.  She does not appear
to have been on heparin at rehab.  Her platelets eventually
began trending upward again toward the end of her hospital stay.

7.  H/o A. fib.  The patient is on coumadin and initially had a
supratherapeutic INR.  Her coumadin was initially held, but
restarted when her INR returned to the therapeutic range.

8. HTN. The patient is on lisinopril at home.  This medicatin
