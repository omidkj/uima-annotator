Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2356**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular fibrillation arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD placement


History of Present Illness:
69 yo man with a history of CAD s/p PTCI ([**2180**]) & CABG ([**4-/2188**]),
s/p pacer for junctional bradycardia([**2186**]), afib on coumadin,
and ESRD on HD (being evaluated for renal tx), who is
transferred from Good [**Hospital 5159**] Hospital for evaluation for ICD
placement after ventricular fibrillation arrest.  Of note, pt
gets most of his cardiac care at [**Hospital1 18**] as well.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] initially presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on
[**2188-7-27**] after falling off of commode at his nursing home.  He
reportedtly fell asleep, fell off commode, and sustained head
trauma.  He was awake & talking after fall and was brought to
OSH ED, where he went into V-Fib arrest. According to OSH
records, he was defibrillated once, and developed wide complex
tachycardia.  He was then given IV amio bolus as well as
dopamine for apparent hypotension.  He was intubated and a head
CT was obtained, which was negative for ICH.  He was admitted to
OSH ICU.  In ICU, amiodarone was discontinued.  Cardiac enzymes
were negative.  CXR was concerning for possible PNA ("basilar
densities") as well as CHF.  Of note, his WBC was elelvated at
14, though it is unclear if he was ever febrile.  He was not
given abx for PNA.  Sputum grew Pseudomonas. He was given
ceftriaxone for UTI (GNR on g-stain).  For his CHF, he received
urgent dialysis on [**7-28**] with removal of 2.1kg.  Two attempts
were made to wean pt off the vent using CPAP however pt was
continued on vent due to "inadequate" blood gases.

Brief Hospital Course:
s/p Ventricular Arrythmia: Pt was transferred after Ventricular
tachycardia requiring cradioversion. The most likely etiology is
structural heart disease vs  scar rather than acute
ischemia/infarction given negative CE at OSH.  Pt underwent
pacemaker interrogation which confirmed the VTach event and is
now s/p ICD placement.
Pt had been loaded with Amiodarone at OSH in setting of
ventricular tachycardia and has been continued Amiodarone 200mg
daily.  Pt was transitioned to Carvedilol 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. Pt will need
follow up with EP for EP investigation and testing of ICD device
after 4wks of therapeutic anticoagulation.
.
Respiratory Failure: Pt was transferred s/p endotracheal
intubation in setting of ventricular tachycardia.  Pt was noted
to have a fever on admission and CXR from OSH was read as
"bibasilar infiltrates".  Repeat CXR showed possible right sided
opacity and pt was started on Cefepime due to a sputum that was
positive for pseudomonas and enterobacter, pan sensitive. Pt was
weaned and extubated on [**8-1**].  Pt completed a ten day course of
Cefepime for and required aggressive diuresis for pulm edema and
right sided pleural effusion.  Pt was sating well on room air
and denying any ongoing shortness of breath despite residual
moderate right sided pleural effusion.
.
Syncope: Pt initally presented to the OSH after fall while on
commode.  It is unclear if there was any LOC. However, the
ventricular tachycardia event in the OSH ED raises suspicion for
arrythmogenic cause of syncope.  Pt did sustain a head trauma
during fall.  However, CT scan of head was negative and neuro
status remained stable in house.  There have been no further
ventricular arrythmias noted on telemetry and pt had an ICD lead
placed prior to discharge. Pt will need to return for EP follow
up and ICD investigation after 4wks of anticoagulation.
.
CAD: Pt with h/o MIs of CABG & PTCI. There were no signs of
active ischemia on EKG or by enzymes.  Trop trend:
0.15->0.30->0.26, though CKs/MB fraction were not elevated,
suggesting possible demand ischemia from CHF/recent arrest in
setting of renal failure.  Patient was continued on ASA,
Carvedilol, ACE I, and statin.
.
Cardiomyopathy: Pt with a history CAD s/p MI with baseline
depressed EF.  TTE in [**2188-4-5**] revealed EF of 30-40%.  Pt had
an Echo done on [**7-30**] that revealed a worsened EF of 15-20%.  Pt
will need a follow up echo given that these images were
performed after cardioversion and function may
