CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxia, change in mental status.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old man with a
history of mental retardation, congestive obstructive
pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease with known CO2
retention, obstructive-sleep apnea, who was discharged from
the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2-9**] after admit
for hypoxemia, which improved with 2-3 liters of O2 by nasal
cannula.  Patient was discharged at that time without
intervention.

On the date of admission, the patient was noted to have
increasing lethargy and also noted to have body twitching,
which he has had on previous admission as well.  On
admission, the patient was afebrile and had O2 sat of 92-94%
on [**3-14**] liters.  He seemed increasingly weak and lethargic,
and had incontinence of bowel and bladder which was new for
him.  The patient was sent to the Emergency Department for
evaluation.

Somewhere between the Emergency Department and the ambulance,
the patient was placed on 100% nonrebreather.  In the
Emergency Department, he was noted to be lethargic, and
arterial blood gas done which was 7.32/108/225.

This improved and the patient was decreased to a 35% face
mask.  Once the patient became slightly less lethargic, he
had a productive cough for several days.  He says he was
coughing up food particles on occasion, but had difficulty
clearing secretions at time.  Denied any fever or chills.
Did have some dyspnea.  In the Emergency Department, he was
given levo, Flagyl, and ceftriaxone for questionable left
lower lobe infiltrate, and intravenous Solu-Medrol in case of
congestive obstructive pulmonary disease care.  He is
admitted to the VICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Mild mental retardation.
2. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease status post
intubation in [**2106-8-9**] for hypercarbia secondary to
increased oxygen by nonrebreather.  The patient is on [**3-14**]
liters of home O2.
3. Asthma.
4. Obstructive-sleep apnea.  The patient does not tolerate
BiPAP.
5. Depression with psychosis.
6. Osteoarthritis status post right total hip replacement.
7. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus empyema in
[**2101**].
8. Corneal ulcer status post transplant.
9. Bilateral arteritis.
10. Question of myositis, biopsy on [**6-/2106**] consistent with
myopathic changes, but without definitive diagnosis.  The
patient has been on steroids on 07/[**2106**].
11. Cervical stenosis.
12. Hypertension.
13. Self inflicted abdominal wound, stabbing.
14. History of septic arthritis with total hip replacement.
15. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

ALLERGIES:  Diltiazem, dust, eggs, and lactose.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Pred-Forte 1% OD qid.
2. Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizer.
3. Prednisone taper as 40 mg po q day.
4. Cardura 2 mg po q day.
5. Monopril 10 mg po q day.
6. Detrol 2 mg po q day.
7. Singulair 10 mg po q day.
8. Multivitamin.
9. Tums.
10. Serevent inhaler two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
11. Zyrtec 10 mg po q day.
12. Iron sulfate 325 mg po q day.
13. Neurontin 300 mg po bid.
14. Zyprexa 10 mg po bid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is living at the [**Hospital 19495**].  His sister, [**Name (NI) **], is the health-care proxy.  [**Name (NI) **]
smoking history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  98.6, 153/87, 90, 20, 92% on 30% face
mask.  General:  Breathing comfortably in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Mucous membranes are
moist.  Oropharynx is clear.  Neck:  No jugular venous
distention.  Lungs:  Poor air movement, no wheezes, rales, or
rhonchi.  Decreased breath sounds at the right base.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Dusky skin
discoloration, bilateral lower extremity edema, 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurologic is alert and oriented
times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cells 5.4, hematocrit 34.5, bicarb
49.

CHEST X-RAY:  Poor study, but question of left lower lobe
pneumonia.

Pulmonary function tests on [**1-24**] demonstrated a FVC
of 16%, FEV1 of 14%, FEV1/FVC of 88%.

Chest CT scan in [**5-/2106**] demonstrated enlarged pulmonary
artery, bibasilar atelectasis, ground-glass opacities in
bilateral upper mid lung zones, hilar adenopathy,
bronchiectasis in the left lower lobe.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypoxia.  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
question of left lower lobe pneumonia versus congestive
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  Patient's O2
sats remained stable for the patient, and he was quickly
titrated down from his face mask to his nasal cannula of 3
liters.  As the patient was at his baseline oxygen
requirements, it was not felt to be a congestive obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation.  Patient has been started on
higher dose of prednisone in the MICU, but when he was
transferred to the floor, the patient was placed back on his
taper of 40 mg po q day.  The patient was maintained on
Levaquin 500 mg po q day to complete a seven day course for a
question of a left lower lobe infiltrate due to the patient's
poor ability to comply with x-rays.  This could not be
further evaluated.

Patient's myopathic disease likely contributes to his
difficulty breathing and inability to clear hypercarbia.  The
patient was transferred out of the MICU on hospital day one
and did very well.  He was at his baseline and ready to
return to the [**Hospital 19497**], [**Hospital3 1761**].

2. Myopathy:  I discussed the case with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
the patient's neurologist, who said the patient's myopathy
was of unclear etiology, and had nonspecific biopsy results.
No further workup was planned as the patient has not had good
results from steroid use.  Steroids were being tapered.  This
plan was continued as inpatient.  The patient will continue
his outpatient steroid taper at Star of [**Doctor Last Name **].

3. Swallowing:  The patient was questioned to have aspiration
stating that he was coughing up food particles.  Bedside
swallow evaluation was performed which did not reveal any
signs of aspiration.  The slight decrease in clearing of
secretions may be related to his myopathy.  A video swallow
was not performed as there was self-limited utility.

4. Iritis/corneal ulcer:  As patient has missed several
outpatient appointments with his ophthalmologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
the patient was sent to [**Hospital 8183**] Clinic from the floor.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was unavailable, but he was seen by another
ophthalmologist.  Examination revealed no evidence for
iritis.  Corneal transplant doing well.  No evidence for
corneal ulcer.  Artificial tears was recommended qid for
keratitis.  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one month.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to Star of
[**Doctor Last Name **] with followup in one month with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. PredForte 1% OD qid.
2. Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizer.
3. Prednisone taper as 40 mg po q day.
4. Cardura 2 mg po q day.
5. Monopril 10 mg po q day.
