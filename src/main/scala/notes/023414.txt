Chief Complaint:
asthma exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 25F with a history of asthma requiring intubation
in the past who presented to the ED today with an asthma
exacerbation that started this morning. The patient was in her
usual state of health until yesterday when she developed a sore
throat and a cough productive of clear sputum. She did not have
any fevers, chills, myalgias, rhinorhea, congestion. She denies
any [**Known lastname **] contacts although she does have a young son at home.
She reports that her breathing was fine until this morning when
she woke up around 1:30AM feeling short of breath. She tried her
albuterol MDI but did not get any relief. Due to her persistent
symptoms she called an ambulance and was brought to the ED.

In the ED, Initial Vitals were 97.7 112 162/97 24 100%. Peak
Flow was 175 (baseline is ~350). She was given albuterol and
ipratropium nebulizers, solumedrol, and 2 grams of magnesium
with some improvement in her symptoms. However due to persistent
wheezing and tachypnea she was admitted to the MICU for further
management.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient is able to speak comfortably
in full sentences. She reports feeling much better than when she
arrived.

With regards to the patient's asthma, it has been chronic for
most of her life. Her main triggers are exertion and allergies.
In particular she is allergic to dogs and cats, and she lives
with her mother who has a dog and a cat. She also smokes [**2-12**]
cigarettes per day and smokes marijuana once per day. She uses
her albuterol MDI approximately once per day. She does not use
any controller medications. She was prescribed Advair in the
past after her intubation but it is not covered by her insurance
and so she has not been on it. She has night cough several times
per month.

Brief Hospital Course:

in the past who presented with an asthma exacerbation.

ACUTE ISSUES

#) Asthma Exacerbation: Though the trigger for this exacerbation
is unclear, sore throat and cough on the day prior to admission
suggest a possible viral trigger although no other symptoms.
Leukocytosis present, but no fevers, and no localizing signs for
a bacterial infection. Patient also reports allergies to dogs
and cats, both of which live in the house with her. In addition,
she smokes [**2-12**] cigarettes per day. Her asthma is poorly
controlled at baseline, as she requires her inhaler daily and
she has not been on a daily controller medication due to lack of
coverage by Mass Health.

In the ICU, she was started on albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers
q4h standing plus q2h PRN.  Her peak flows continued to improve
and she was continued on prednisone 60mg daily.  She was started
on fluticasone here as a long term controller medication.  The
Pulmonary team will set up a follow-up appointment for
outpatient management.  Given her splenectomy and asthma
history, pneumovax was given on the floor. Once transferred to
the floor, she continued to improve with albuterol/ipratropium
nebulizers q6h standing as well as her fluticasone inhaler and
oral steroids. On the day of discharge the patient was anxious
to get home to take care of her son at home. She had improved
wheeze, and good oxygen saturations while on room air. She was
instructed that she needs close follow up in our discharge
clinic to ensure that she continues to improve as an outpatient.
She was instructed in how to use her fluticasone inhaler and the
importance of using it daily as a control medication and she
understands. She will be given a steroid taper to complete as an
outpatient.

# Hypertension: Systolic [**Month/Day (3) **] pressures to the 170s-180s
persistently while in the ICU.  She is not on any
anti-hypertensives at home.  She was started on a low dose of
captopril for better control, which was increased when she was
transferred to the floor. Initially it was felt hr hypertension
was due to around the clock albuterol administration as well as
a high steroid load administered in the emergency department
exerting mineralocorticoid activity. However, at the time of
discharge she remained hypertensive and the decision was made to
initiate daily HCTZ for [**Month/Day (3) **] pressure control. This should be
followed up as an outpatient in our discharge clinic as she may
need this medication discontinued should her [**Month/Day (3) **] pressure
return to baseline when not on albuterol so frequently.

# Tobacco abuse, marijuana abuse: The patient was counseled on
the importance of smoking cessation to her overall
