CXR [**9-17**]:
The lungs are lucent and hyperinflated with flattening of the
diaphragms consistent with COPD/emphysema. There is no pneumonia
or CHF. The blunting at the right lung base represents
scarrring, better seen on CT later the same date. There is no
pneumothorax or effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
normal. The osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. Emphysema.
.
CT Head [**9-17**]:
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, major
vascular territorial infarction, hydrocephalus, or edema. The
ventricles and
sulci show some disproportionate atrophy in the cerebellum. The
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Cerebellar atrophy.


Brief Hospital Course:
59yo gentleman with h/o alcohol abuse who presented s/p fall and
was found to be hypoglycemic and hypothermic.

# s/p fall/Syncope: Most likely related to his hypoglycemia.
Also suspect he has some cerebellar dysfunction from alcohol
abuse given atrophy on head CT.  No evidence of traumatic injury
on exam.  Other causes include arrhythmia, which he is at risk
for given electrolyte abnormalities.  EKG is sinus tachycardia.
No events seen on tele.

# Alcohol abuse/Hypoglycemia:
Suspect that patient has starvation ketosis from his alcohol
abuse and poor nutritional status.  Although he has no reported
history of withdrawal, seizures, or DTs, he is certainly at risk
given the clinical evidence of ongoing alcohol abuse.
He was kept on CIWA scales, but did not require Valium.
Continie thiamine, folate, MIC replacement.  He was seen by
social work and will follow up with PCP , [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He was treated with IV fluids with dextrose with close
monitoring of BS.

# Metabolic acidosis:
Patient had marked anion gap with lactate of 8 on presentation
that has since resolved with lactate of 1.3 after IV fluids.
Most likely has starvation ketosis, but would also consider
ingestions such as ethylene glycol.  [**Month (only) 116**] also have been caused
by shivering in setting of hypothermia.  Posms were assessed for
unaccounted osms, no missing osms.  Abdominal exam were benign
- f/u final abdominal CT- still pending at time of discharge.

# Hypothermia:
Most likely due to hypoglycemia.  Would also consider infection,
although no infectious symptoms on review of systems and temp
has normalized.  No evidence of infection by UA, UCx, BCx, and
sputum Cx at time of discharge, though some were still pending.
- TSH was normal

# Hypertension:
Too early for alcohol withdrawal or DTs, so pt most likely has
longstanding undiagnosed HTN.  No chest pain or headache.
Lisinopril 5mg daily was started so as not to disguise
tachycardia with good control.  Patient was discharged on this
medicaiton.

# Cachexia:
Suspect this is from his alcoholism, but he admits to episodes
of BRBPR about 1 month ago. In addition has had fatigue,
weightloss, and other symptoms concerning for malignancy.
- arrange for PCP so that he can have outpatient colonoscopy
- consider outpatient CT-chest

# Sinus tachycardia:
Most likely from dehydration. Improved with fluid resuscitation

# PPx:  Heparin SubQ

# Code:  Confirmed FULL

# Comm:  with brother [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79759**] (h); [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79760**] (c)

# Dispo: Will likely be d/c??????d home from the MICU for follow up
with Social work and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].

Discharge Condition:
good


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after falling.  You were found to have very
low blood sugar (20) and low temperature. You were admitted to
the ICU for management of these conditions which were felt
likely a result of alcohol use. While you were in the ICU, your
blood sugar and temperature were normal. CT scan of your head,
abdomen and pelvis failed to demonstrate any concerning acute
pathology. Your head CT did show cerebellar atrophy which means
there is a reduction in the size of a part of your brain.  This
is a condition that usually occurs over a long period of time
and could be secondary to alcohol use or can occur with age. You
should discuss this with your primary care physician at your
next appointment.

Please call 911 or return to the emergency department if you
experience nausea/vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath,
difficult breathing, seizure, pass out, or have any other
concerning symptoms.

Followup Instructions:
You should follow up with your new PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within
the next 2 weeks. You should call the [**Hospital3 **]
clinic ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]) to set up an appointment.
