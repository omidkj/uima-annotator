Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with 2 stents placed to the LAD


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13469**] is a 61 year-old woman with a history of coronary
artery disease with CABG x 3 (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-RCA) with
known occluded vein grafts and recent admission with stenting to
her LAD who presents with chest pain.

Was admitted from [**11-28**] - [**12-4**] for NSTEMI.  At that time, her ECG
showed ST depressions and her CK peaked at 839 and troponin of
1.97.  Cardiac catheterization showed in-stent restenosis of her
BMS to LAD was seen which was [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 105862**].  She continued to
have chest pain post intervention and subsequently underwent
persantine MIBI on [**2108-12-3**]; this showed no reversible ischemia.
Her hospital course was complicated by intermittent junctional
rhythm and possible AV dissociation.  As a result, her
metoprolol dose was decreased.

Reports return of her anginal symptoms (back pain with radiation
to arm; chest pressure) beginning a few days after discharge.
These episodes would last minutes and would always be responsive
to nitro though she would use spray/tabs up to 14+ times per
day.  Some mild SOB and diapheresis with these episodes.  Not
always with exertion.  Overall, these episodes were similar to
those experienced after her cath on her last admission.

On the evening of admission, she returned home after shopping
and - after moving 4 bags of packages into her home - she began
to experience her angina.  It was more severe ([**8-5**]) and
persisted.  She took [**3-31**] SL nitro and many sprays without relief
and called her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] then drove herself to an OSH.

Initially presented to an OSH where she was noted to have
ST-depressions and was given morphine, metoprolol and started on
a nitro gtt.  Troponin T returned at 0.017.

In the ED, T 98.7, HR 112, BP 209/89, RR 14.  Recieved morphine
4mg IV and dilaudid 0.5mg IV.  BP improved ot 133/95 at the time
of transfer with nitro gtt up to 0.98mcg/kg/min.

STUDIES:
ECG #1 ([**12-11**] at 22:29; OSH): NST at 109.  3 PVCs noted. LVH
with LBBB morphology. ST-depressions in V3-V6 in the setting of
LVH.
ECG #2 ([**12-12**] at 0:30; [**Hospital1 **]): NST at 77.  PAC noted.  TWI in I/L
(old).  Long QT?

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2107-4-14**])
1. LA is moderately dilated
2. Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size
3. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with inferior
hypokinesis (LVEF 50%)
4. RV chamber size and free wall motion are normal
5. A bileaflet AV prosthesis is present
6. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. MV leaflets are mildly thickened; no mitral valve prolapse

PERSANTINE MIBI ([**2108-12-3**]):
1. Improvement of the previously described fixed inferior wall
perfusion defect. No definite new or reversible perfusion
defects identified, although the myocardium appears
heterogeneous. 2. Global hypokinesis with an LVEF of 36%.

CARDIAC CATH ([**2108-11-29**]):
- LMCA: short with diffuse disease
- LAD: 99% ISRS in the proximal LAD with TIMI 1 flow into the
diagonal
- LCX: 50-60% diffuse disease proximally
- RCA: 100% chronic proximal total occlusion
- LIMA->LAD: patent
- SVG->OM and SVG->RCA: occluded

Cardiac cath ([**12-12**]):
1- Limited selective coronary angiography of the revealed mild
disease
throughout the short LMCA and subtotal occlusion with evident
thrombosis
in the recently placed proximal LAD [**Month/Year (2) **] with extension distally
of
thrombus versus dissection into the LAD-Diagonal distribution.
The LCX
was a non-dominant vessel with diffuse 60-70% diffuse proximal
disease
(unchanged from prior). The RCA (known occluded), LIMA (known
patent)
and SVGs were not engaged (known to be occluded).
2- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment revealed normal
systemic
arterial pressure (125/66 mmHg).
3- Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD into a large
D1
branch with two overlapping 2.25x28 mm MiniVision (distal) and
2.5x18 mm
Vision (proximal) bare-metal stents, both posted with the 2.5x18
mm
stent balloon (low pressure distally, high pressure proximally).
A
contained perforation of a small branch was noted following
advancement
of the PTGI wire with no expansion of the dye capping area on
repeated
angographic views (over 15 minutes) and complete hemodynamic
stability.
A bedside echocardiogram also confir
