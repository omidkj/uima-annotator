Chest x-ray showed retrocardiac density.  Abdominal
ultrasound showed small ascites.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  A 59-year-old male with end-stage liver
disease secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis admitted
with worsening hepatic encephalopathy and left lower lobe
pneumonia.

1. Encephalopathy:  The patient was given lactulose [**2-4**] bowel
movements a day and was started on Flagyl 500 mg po bid for
decontamination.  He improved on this regimen, and was clear
in his mental status upon discharge.

2. ID:  The patient did have no fever and a normal white
blood cell count, but did have some evidence of pneumonia on
examination and on his chest x-ray with a left lower lobe
infiltrate.  He was initially given ceftriaxone 1 gram po q
day and was switched over to po Levaquin to complete a 10 day
course of antibiotics for his pneumonia.

A diagnostic and mildly therapeutic tap of his ascites was
done that did not show any evidence of SBP.  One liter was
removed from his abdomen.

3. End-stage liver disease:  The patient was continued on his
nadolol, ursodiol.  He initially had his spironolactone held
for lower blood pressures in the 90s, but this was restarted
at 100 mg po q day.  He was also continued on his Protonix 40
mg po q day.

4. Abdominal distention:  Patient had a level of abdominal
distention that was greater than what would be if he just had
ascites.  He had a KUB that did show increased intraluminal
bowel gas that was likely secondary to increased gas
production from his lactulose.  He was started on Flagyl for
decontamination to also try to decrease the gas.  One liter
of ascites was taken off this hospitalization by
paracentesis.

5. Ulcerative colitis:  The patient had no symptoms referable
to this, and was continued on Pentasa 1,000 mg tid.

6. Nutrition:  Mr. [**Known lastname 16189**] was not taking adequate nutrition
by a calorie count that estimated him around 400-500 calories
per day with a goal of 2,000 calories per day in the
hospital.  He had a post-pyloric tube placed two times during
this hospitalization, but of which the tube was accidentally
pulled out by Mr. [**Known lastname 16189**].  It was decided that for
disposition, that he would be followed as an outpatient
Nutrition, Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) 41841**], and the liver service for calorie
count while he was on home food that he preferred more.
He will follow up in the Liver Center for outpatient
nutrition.

He was continued on his multivitamins and given Boost
supplementation.

The patient was discharged home after his encephalopathy
resolved after treatment with lactulose and Flagyl and
treatment of his pneumonia with ceftriaxone.

He will have VNA services at home.  He will actually stay
with his sister.

He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] within a week.
