Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea, dry heaves, diarrhea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Shoulder Washout and Vancomycin Bead Placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69 year old woman with autoimmune hepatitis
causing cirrhosis, on chronic prednisone, celiac sprue, CODP,
and multiple infections (see below) who presents with nausea,
dry heaves and diarrhea. Patient states this is d/t linezolid,
and has been occuring for 10-12 days, worsening as the week has
progressed. Relates poor PO intake and 4 pound weight loss in
one week (although ate chicken salad and french fries for
lunch). No fevers, chills, or abdominal pain. No melena or
hematochezia. Patient has not noticed increasing abdominal
girth, although her daughter thinks that her belly might be
slightly larger. No abdnormal foods, eating out at restaurants,
sick contacts, camping. + salty and dry mouth. No dysuria, SOB,
chest pain. Last dry heave this a.m.
.
In regards to the infections, her most recent one included MRSA
septic arthritis ([**1-15**]) with MRSA bactermia ([**1-13**]) treated with
IV vanc x 4 weeks, followed by repeat admission on [**2-13**] for
fevers, found to have shoulder abscess demonstrating MRSA on
[**2133-2-19**] (PICC had been pulled on [**2133-2-12**] in [**Hospital **] clinic). The
abscess was treated again with IV vancomycin, but stopped on
[**3-10**] d/t rash. She was then started on linezolid, which she is
currently taking. All surveillance blood cultures since then
have been negative. Was again admitted on [**3-24**] for fevers and
workup inhouse found a UTI and possible continued infection of
left shoulder joint, continued on linezolid.

[**4-18**] CT abdomen and pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. New moderate intraabdominal ascites, most prominent
surrounding the liver and spleen.
2. Gas filled collection in left lower pelvis is again see
consistent with
patient's known diverticular abscess. However, there is new wall
thickening and intraluminla debris concerning for
superinfection.
3. Unchanged lobular liver contour consistent with patient's
known aurtoimmune hepatitis.

FINDINGS: There has been interval placement of radiopaque

described lucencies. There is still one area of lucency without
the radiopaque material filling it and staples are present.
There is a small amount of soft tissue air. A drain is in place.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Persistent abscess cavity within the humeral head and
proximal humeral diaphysis with resolution of the previously
noted edema in the mid and distal
humeral diaphysis.
2.  Worsening avascular necrosis of the humeral head which now
involves 2 cm of the overlying articular surface (previously 1
cm), without evidence of focal collapse of the cortex.
3.  Chronic rupture of the long head of the biceps tendon,
unchanged.

AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:

There has been interval removal of the right-sided subclavian
line. New right-sided PICC line is seen with tip overlying the
distal SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Pulmonary
vascularity appears within normal limits and no focal
consolidation seen within the lungs. Surgical staples noted in
the left shoulder with postoperative changes again seen.

IMPRESSION: Interval removal of right subclavian line with
placement of right PICC with tip overlying the distal SVC. No
evidence of pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old female with autoimmune hepatitis, celiac sprue, and
recurrent infections who presents with nausea, dry heaves,
diarrhea, and poor PO intake.
.
# Nausea/Dry Heaves/Diarrhea - Nausea, diarrhea, pancytopenia,
and lactic acidosis all consistent with linezolid toxicity.
Linezolid was stopped and nausea/dry heaves, and diarrhea all
improved.  Pancytopenia continued, but the patient was supported
with blood products as needed, and this stabalized.  Lactic
acidosis resolved (high of 15, low of 2).  Stool was sent for
evaluation and was negative for C. diff x 3, fecal cultures and
O&P also negative.  LFT's normal. Initially there was concern
for failure to thrive d/t poor PO intake, but once the nausea
resolved, the patient was able to maintain adequate caloric
intake and did not require an NGT.
.
# Septic Arthritis/Osteomyelitis - MRI on [**4-13**] showed evidence
of worsening [**Month/Year (2) 1083**] process. [**Month/Year (2) 5498**] was c
