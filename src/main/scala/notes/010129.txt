a history of C7 paraplegia status post MVA in [**2119**], type 2
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, nursing home
resident who was sent to the Emergency Room for increased
respiratory rate.  The patient was initially seen at an
outside hospital on [**10-13**] for complaints of dyspnea, increased
respiratory rate and hypoxia.  At the time the patient had
rales and rhonchi over his right middle lobe and he was sent
out with a prescription for 14 days of Flagyl.  On the
morning of admission the patient was seen by plastic surgery
for debridement of his left leg ulcer.  While there, the
patient was visibly tachypneic with a room air sat of 82%.
He was sent to the Emergency Room for evaluation.  In the
Emergency Room the patient required escalating amounts of
oxygen supplementation, ultimately requiring 100% face mask
with sats in the 84-89% range.  On physical exam he had
diffuse rales and cough with thick sputum.  A chest x-ray
showed a left lower lobe infiltrate, all consistent with
pneumonia.  In the Emergency Room he was given, in addition
to Flagyl, 1 gm of Vancomycin and 2 gm of Ceftriaxone IV.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 56-year-old man with a C7 spinal
cord injury, status post MVA in [**2119**], diabetes mellitus type
2, hypertension, who presented with peak oxygen saturations
with increased oxygen requirements, thick sputum as well as a
chest x-ray consistent with pneumonia.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient's clinical presentation was
consistent with pneumonia.  Given her C7 paraplegia and
impaired secretion clearance, he was initially admitted to
the medicine Intensive Care Unit.  With his worsening hypoxia
on the day of admission, the team was concerned that the
patient would need to be intubated for possible aggressive
pulmonary toilet.  The patient gradually improved on IV
antibiotics and was weaned off the oxygen and was transferred
to the medicine floor on hospital day three.  In addition,
physical therapy and deep suctioning were done on the patient
in order to clear his secretions.  He was also given
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers prn.

2.  ID:  The patient's elevated white cell count was thought
to be secondary to his pneumonia.  On admission he was given
Flagyl and Ceftriaxone and he will be discharged with a
prescription for Flagyl and Levaquin to complete a 14 day
course of antibiotics.

3.  Endocrine:  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes
mellitus.  The patient was given [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diet while he was in
the hospital and was placed on a sliding scale insulin.  He
had no further endocrine issues.

4.  GI:  Initially the patient was NPO for possible
intubation.  There was a question of whether or not the
patient had an appropriate gag reflex.  He had a speech and
swallow study while he was in the medicine ICU.  It was
determined that the patient was able to tolerate all
consistencies during the swallow trial and appeared to manage
dry solids without any difficulty.

5.  Psych:  A psychiatric evaluation was requested given the
concern at his nursing facility that he had been
confrontational and possibly depressed.  Their evaluation of
the patient was that he was quite pleasant, positive and non
confrontational and very cooperative.  He, at the time,
denied any depression and did not appear overtly depressed or
hopeless.  They recommended a further psych evaluation when
he returns to [**Hospital1 8**] as needed.

6.  Wound:  His lateral left lower extremity has an 8 by 3 cm
open ulcer, pink at the base with minimal drainage.  His
sacrum and upper thighs and buttocks have evidence of scar
tissue from previous skin breakdown.  His left plantar
surface of the foot below the 4th and 5th toes have an opened
3 cm by 3 cm ulcer with 50% eschar and 50% pink face.  The
wound care specialist recommended a first step mattress to
cleaning the wounds with saline and applying Duoderm wound
gel, and cover with normal saline moist dressing and DSD,
then cling wrap.  They also recommended a nutrition consult
for protein calorie supplements.
