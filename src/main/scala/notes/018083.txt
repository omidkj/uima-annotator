Pertinent Results:
Echocardiogram [**2199-5-29**]: Baseline evaluation of gradient and
coronary anatomy prior to intervention:
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and hyperdynamic systolic function. (EF>75%).
There is valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] with a severe (100mmHg peak) resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  After injection of
the 2nd septal with diluted (3:7) Optison, there is
hyperenhancement in the distal third of the basal anterior
septum There was no enhancement of the right ventricular free
wall or inferior wall.

Echocardiogram [**2199-5-29**]: Focused evaluation during ethanol
ablation Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:
After injection of 1ml and 0.5ml of alcohol, there is intense
hyperenhancement of the distal thrid of the basal septum.
Continuous wave and pulsed Doppler demonstrated a 25-30mmHg peak
LVOT gradient. After injection of diluted (3:7) Optison into the
1st septal, there was hyperenhancement of the mid-portion of the
basal septum. Following alcohol injection (1.5ml total), there
was further hyperenhancement of the region and the peak LVOT
gradient was <20mmHg. Global systolic function remains excellent
and valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] persists. Minimal/mild mitral regurgitation is
now seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 year-old woman with HOCM, referred for ethanol septal
ablation.
## Cardiac:
a. HOCM: Pt tolerated EtOH septal ablation well. She was
followed in the CCU and had no difficulties with heart block.
She had a pacemaker in place for 48 hours but the pacer was not
triggered and this was d/c'd. She had no chest pain and cardiac
enzymes trended down.
.
b. HTN: The pt's outpatient meds were metoprolol and diltiazem.
However, given her diabetes, she was switched from diltiazem to
lisinopril. Her blood pressure remained in good range. She will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and her PCP for further adjustment of
these medications.

2. Diabetes: The pt's metformin was held post procedure and she
was kept on sliding scale insulin while in house. She was
restarted on metformin on discharge.

3. COPD: She was continued on Comibent and Advair.

4. Cholesterol- She was continued on Lipitor.

5. GI: Given h/o GI bleeding, Hct was followed but remained
stable. She had no melena or BRBPR.
