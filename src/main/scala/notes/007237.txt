CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Worsened shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year old Caucasian
female with known congestive heart failure, who presents as
an elective admission for worsened shortness of breath and
administration of Natrecor.  The patient states that over the
past two weeks she has had felt more fatigued and short of
breath.  The patient can no longer climb stairs, and
consistently gets short of breath after walking about forty
yards, and some times gets short of breath just sitting at
rest.  The patient endorses orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, and abdominal distention.  The patient denies any
lower extremity edema, and states she has actually lost about
six pounds over the past few months.  The patient also states
she has poor appetite.  The patient does not adhere to a
strict low salt diet and drinks a lot of water, good constant
urine output.

In cardiac review of systems, the patient had a resolving dry
cough times two weeks, no fever or chills.  The patient gets
intermittent left sided chest pain times two to three
seconds, about one time a day, relieved spontaneously,
occurring only at rest, no Nitroglycerin.  Currently, the
patient is pain free.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.

4.  Status post myocardial infarction on [**2112-7-27**].
5.  Osteoarthritis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. twice a day.

6.  Limeperide 4 mg p.o. once daily.

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any current or past
history of tobacco or alcohol use.  The patient lives alone
and is widowed.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father passed away of a
myocardial infarction at age 62.  The patient's brother died
of a myocardial infarction at age 45.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature 98.5,
pulse 114, blood pressure 125/56, respiratory rate 18, oxygen
saturation 95% in room air.  In general, the patient is well
appearing in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat examination - Mucous membranes are moist.  The
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Neck
revealed normal carotid upstroke, no bruits, 10 centimeter
jugular venous distention, positive hepatojugular reflux,
clean left carotid endarterectomy scar.  Lungs - bibasilar
crackles two thirds of the way up from the base.  The abdomen
revealed normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly, no bruits or masses.
Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented times three
with no focal signs.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 8.8, hematocrit
25.7, platelet count 396,000.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.8,
chloride 104, bicarbonate 22, blood urea nitrogen 72,
creatinine 2.7, glucose 176, calcium 9.5, magnesium 2.2,
phosphate 5.3.

Echocardiogram from [**2112-7-28**], showed mild left atrial
dilatation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy,
severe global hypokinesis, ejection fraction of 20%, trace
mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, tricuspid
regurgitation.  Cardiac catheterization from [**2112-8-3**], showed
two vessel coronary artery disease, moderate systolic and
diastolic function, mild pulmonary artery hypertension, left
anterior descending 50% occluded after occluded D1, OM1 30%
occluded, right coronary artery total occlusion proximally
with collaterals from the left anterior descending filling in
distally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is an 80 year old female
with congestive heart failure who presents with congestive
heart failure exacerbation and admission for Natrecor
administration.

1.  Congestive heart failure - The patient initially received
a bolus of Natrecor followed by a continuous infusion.  The
patient appeared to be tolerating the drug well, but after a
few hours, the patient was noted to be symptomatically
hypotensive with a blood pressure as low as 70 to 75 over
palpable.  The patient was also very weak and dizzy during
this episode.  The patient was taken off the Natrecor, and
her Lasix and Lisinopril were held.  The patient received
three to four boluses of 250 ml of normal saline, and her
pressure responded appropriately.  The patient was
transferred to the CCU the following day in order to
determine her filling pressures.  In the CCU, the patient
received a Swan-Ganz catheter.  The patient had pulmonary
artery blood pressure of 34/23 and a pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of [**11-12**].  The patient had a cardiac output of
6.4 and stomach vascular resistance of 1138.  The patient had
a chest x-ray in the unit which showed no evidence of
congestive heart failure in spite of the fact that her
examination continued to reveal crackles two thirds of the
way up from the base bilaterally.  Because the patient was
noted also to be anemic on admission with a hematocrit of
25.7, down from her baseline of 35.6 in [**2112-8-1**], the
patient also received four units of blood.  The patient
responded well to the blood and did not become volume
overloaded.  The patient was transferred back to the
C-Medicine service after about 24 hours.  She was placed back
on a lower dose of Lasix at 40 mg p.o. twice a day and her
Lisinopril was restarted.  The patient was overall less short
of breath for the rest of her admission.  This may largely be
due to the blood transfusions that the patient received while
in the CCU.

2.  Coronary artery disease - The patient has known coronary
artery disease and is status post myocardial infarction on
[**2112-7-27**].  The patient also has multiple risk factors
including age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and strong family history.  While the
fleeting pain the patient describes on admission was not very
concerning for unstable angina, the fact that she was
becoming increasingly short of breath may have pointed to
further ischemia.  For this reason, the patient received a
Dobutamine echocardiogram after her
