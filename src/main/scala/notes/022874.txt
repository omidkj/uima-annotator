History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92920**] is a 71 year old woman with a history of
hypertension and afib, on coumadin, who has complained of
headache and neck pain for two days.  Today at 1 p.m. she was
found in her car in a public parking lot, unresponsive.  In the
field her BP was 170/90, HR 92, BG 137. Intubation was attempted
unsuccessfully and she vomited.  She was bagged until she
arrived at [**Hospital1 **] at 1:11 p.m.  There she was noted to have
reactive pupils, 3>2 mm, but otherwise no movement and no
responsiveness on examination.  Her initial BP was 86/41, HR 80,
RR 18.  She was given etomidate, succinylcholine, and intubated.
 She had intermittent bradycardia to the 40's.  Head CT revealed
a massive intraventricular hemorrhage with subarachnoid blood.
She had an INR of 3.73.  She was given dilantin and mannitol IV.
 FFP was ordered but did not arrive before she was transferred
to [**Hospital3 **], with arrival at 4 p.m. Hence her anticoagulation
was not reversed until 4:05 p.m., when she was given 2 bottles
of proplex and 10 mg vitamin K SC.

Neurosurgery was consulted and placement of an EVD was attempted
on three occasions, with clotting each time preventing any
drainage.  She again received mannitol, with a dose of decadron
as well.  It was decided that no surgical intervention could be
performed and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed with the family the gravity
of the situation.  They requested transfer back to [**Hospital1 **],
but that hospital refused.  The family expressed that they
wanted full medical treatment, and hence the patient was ordered
for an ICU bed and Neurology was consulted, 5 hours after her
arrival in the ED.

She received Ancef for the attempted EVD placement, and the
following sedating medications: versed 4 mg en route to [**Hospital1 18**]
(around 4 p.m.); ativan 2 mg at 4:35 p.m.; morphine 10 mg at
4:40 p.m.

Review of systems:  As above.

IMAGING:
CT/A of Head: There is a large amount of blood in the right and
left lateral ventricles, in the third and fourth ventricles. The
ventricles are pathologically dilated, and there is a
ventricular drain entering the right frontal lobe and
terminating in the left lateral ventricle. There is a small
amount of parenchymal blood in the left temporal lobe adjacent
to the atrium of the left lateral ventricle. There is a linear
density in the right sylvian fissure, which in the absence of
corresponding vascular abnormalities on the CTA portion of the
study must represent subarachnoid blood. There is a large amount
of blood in the suprasellar, quadrigeminal plate, and other
basal cisterns, which are compressed. There is diffuse edema in
the brain parenchyma, with bilateral subfalcine herniation,
compression of the midbrain and pons, and uncal herniation.
The imaged bones appear unremarkable. The patient is intubated
and has a nasogastric tube.
CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] CTA: The major tributaries of the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] are patent without evidence of stenosis. The left
posterior cerebral artery gives off a prominent branch adjacent
to the area of left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage, but without
evidence of a vascular malformation or aneurysm.
