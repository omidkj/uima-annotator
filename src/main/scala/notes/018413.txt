History of Present Illness:
53 yo female with PMH of HTN and new history of heart block and
myocarditis s/p pacemaker on [**8-7**] who was subsequently readmitted
to [**Hospital3 35813**] Center on [**8-14**] for fatigue and
lightheadedness and transfered here today for increased level of
care.  Pt last felt well in the beginning of [**Month (only) **] when she had
an episode of diarrhea and viral illness.  A couple weeks later
in [**Month (only) **] she started experiencing syncopal episodes and presented
to the ED where she was found to have myocarditis and AV block
requiring pacer placement (type unknown).  At that time, her
trops were 1.06, WBC 15.9, cpk 186, SGOT 51, SGPT 39. Negative
lyme, adenovirus, [**Location (un) **] A&B, echovirus. Positive parvovirus.
 Blood cx negative.  Furthermore a cardiac cath was done which
was reported as "negative" although we do not have these
documents.

She was then discharged the following day but continued to
experience lightheadedness and difficulty breathing.  This
progressively worsened until she was readmitted to LMC on [**8-14**].
At that time her EKG was sinus tachycardia showing ventricular
pacing.  Notable labs include: troponins were 2.34 -> 2.11 ->
2.06 -> 2.02, CK-MB 197 -> 176 -> 168 -> 147. Serum ferritin 75
(nml), SGOT 294, SGPT 232. Hep A,B,C pending. ESR 45. proBNP:
[**Numeric Identifier 2249**]? CXR showed pulmonary congestion and pleural effusion. U/S
liver revealed fatty liver.  Echo [**8-15**] showed EF 30%.

Last night, pt did have an episode of chest pressure,
nausea/vomiting, and extreme diaphoresis.   No intervention was
made at that time.  Since that time she has had increasing
nausea, SOB, fatigue and anorexia.

Upon arrival to the floor, pt is ill-appearing reliant on O2 NC.
 In no acute distress, denying chest pain/pressure.  Vitals:
T98, 112/78, 111, 20, 96 2L NC.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2180-8-19**] at 2:19:08 PM      FINAL
IMPRESSION: Biventricular cavity dilatation with extensive left
ventricular systolic dysfunction suggestive of a non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy. Moderate functional mitral regurgitation.
Moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation with possible
underestimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

CXR Approved: SAT [**2180-8-19**] 8:37 AM

position in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Normal course
of the leads, no fracture.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary
edema, but with moderate bilateral pleural
