Admission Date:  [**2142-10-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-10-31**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old
female with a past medical history significant for
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and remote tobacco use,
who presented to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2142-10-25**]
complaining of several days of shortness of breath and a
nonproductive cough.  The patient was dyspneic but denied any
chest pain.  She was admitted for treatment of a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and was treated
with steroids, nebulizers and antibiotics.

The patient later ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction
with a troponin of 0.30 and a peak CK of 138 with an MB
fraction of 12.8.  Her admission electrocardiogram had
approximately [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V2 through V4 and T wave
inversions in V3 through V5.  The patient went on to develop,
over the course of the next two days, global T wave
inversions with very deep waves across the precordium and
inferiorly.  She was treated with Lovenox, aspirin,
Lopressor, Integrilin and an esmolol drip at the outside
hospital and was transferred for management of her acute
coronary syndrome.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.  Tobacco use.
3.  Emphysema.  4.  Glaucoma, right eye.  5.
Hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a remote but extensive
tobacco history and denies any alcohol use.  The patient
lives alone, she is very functional and active and able to
handle her own activities of daily living.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lescol, Zestril, Fosamax, Alphagan
eye drops and Cosopt eye drops.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 25.8,
hematocrit 37.7, platelet count 380,000, prothrombin time
15.2, INR 1.6, partial thromboplastin time 150, sodium 134,
potassium 4.4, chloride 102, bicarbonate 22, BUN 10 and
creatinine 0.6.  CK on admission was 73; subsequent CKs were
57 and 95.  The patient had a troponin-I of 8.9.  Calcium was
8.6, phosphorous 2 and magnesium 2.

Chest x-ray was consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease with possible superimposed interstitial pulmonary
edema.  Electrocardiogram on [**2142-10-25**] showed [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
elevations in V2 through V4, T wave inversions in V4 through
V5, T wave flattening in V6.  Electrocardiogram on [**2142-10-26**] showed T wave inversions globally with small Q waves
in V3 through V6.  Electrocardiogram on [**2142-10-27**]
showed T wave inversions globally, very deep in the
precordial leads, prolonged QT interval.  A femoral
ultrasound revealed a right groin hematoma but no
pseudoaneurysm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for management of
her acute coronary syndrome.  She was placed on 24 hour
telemetry.  She was continued on aspirin, Lopressor,
Captopril and Lipitor.  In addition, she was maintained on
Integrilin and heparin drips.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable.  She had occasional episodes of
tachycardia which were controlled with additional beta
blocker dosages.  The patient was asymptomatic throughout her
stay and denied any chest discomfort or shortness of breath.

The patient had an echocardiogram on the day of admission to
evaluate her cardiac function.  The echocardiogram revealed
overall left ventricular function moderately depressed, mid
and distal septal, apical and probably anterior severe
hypokinesis.

The patient was taken for a cardiac catheterization on
[**2142-10-29**] with the following findings:  Resting
hemodynamics after angiography revealed elevated left sided
filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 6,
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 12 and a left ventricular
end-diastolic pressure of 19; the cardiac index was depressed
at 2.1.  Left ventriculography revealed apical akinesis with
anterior and inferior hypokinesis; left ventricular ejection
fraction was 37%.  The coronary arteries were free of any
flow limiting stenoses.

The patient returned from the cardiac catheterization
laboratory in stable condition.  Our goal became to maximize
her medical regimen.  She continued to remain asymptomatic,
however, on physical examination the patient had a new right
femoral artery bruit after her procedure.  An ultrasound of
her right groin was performed, which revealed a large
hematoma but no pseudoaneurysm.  The patient's hematocrit was
monitored to insure that it was stable.  Her hematocrit upon
discharge was 33.6, which was stable post cardiac
catheterization.

Given the finding of apical and anterior hypokinesis, the
patient was started on Coumadin.  She will remain on this
Coumadin for at least three months pending a repeat
cardiology evaluation and repeat transthoracic
echocardiogram.

In light of the cardiac catheterization findings of clean
coronary arteries, we concluded that the most likely scenario
in this patient was a ruptured plaque.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was clinically stable
and discharged to home after a physical therapy evaluation
deemed her safe to do so.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Coronary artery disease, status post ruptured plaque.
Hypertension.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Hypercholesterolemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Zestril 5 mg p.o.q.d.
Atenolol 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Lipitor 10 mg p.o.q.h.s.
Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg p.o.q.d.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.q.h.s.
Fosamax 10 mg p.o.q.d.
Alphagan eye drops.
Cosopt eye drops.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was instructed to follow up with her
primary care physician within five days for monitoring of her
PT/INR and re-evaluation of her hematocrit.  The patient will
be referred to a cardiologist in her area for continued
monitoring.
