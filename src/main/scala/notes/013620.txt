ECG Study Date of [**2110-3-16**]  4:28:02 AM
Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization
abnormality.
Probable left atrial abnormality. Extensive ST-T wave
abnormalities may be due
to left ventricular hypertrophy, but may also be due to
ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
C.CATH Study Date of [**2110-3-16**]
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
shows
severe 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA is without
angiographically apparent disease.  The pLAD has a long 70%
stenosis.
The LCx system is without obstructive coronary artery disease.
The mRCA
has a discrete 95% stenosis.
2.  Resting hemodynamic study shows severely elevated left sided
filling
pressure with a PCWP of 29mmHg and pulmonary arterial
hypertension with
PAP of 54/28mmHg.  The cardiac output was maintianed on dopamine
drip
with a cardiac index of 2.5.
3.  Left ventriculography was not obtained as the LV filling
pressure
was quite high and the patient has chronic renal insufficiency.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated left sided filling pressure
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2110-3-16**]:

1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. Coronary artery calcifications.
4. Bilateral renal cysts. 1.5-cm relatively hyperattenuating
rounded lesion in the mid pole of the left kidney likely
represents a hyperdense cyst; however, this could be confirmed
with ultrasound.
5. Small hypodensity seen at the liver dome, possibly
representing a cyst versus partial voluming artifact. This could
also be confirmed with ultrasound.
6. Coronary artery calcifications.
7. Vascular calcifications and calcification of the vas
deferens, suggesting a history of diabetes.
8. Enlargement of the prostate.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2110-3-17**]
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 20% to 25% (nl >=55%)
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot
be excluded.  Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed with global hypokinesis and near akinesis of
the distal LV and apex. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old Portugese speaking man with hypertension, diabetes
mellitus admitted with STEMI. He was taken to cardiac cath
shortly after arrival and found to have diffuse LAD disease and
a tight right coronary lesion which was stented. He was very
clear that he did not want CABG.  His hospital course was
complicated by acute pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
.
1. Cardiac:
a. Coronary artery disease: Cardiac cath showed LAD 70%
long-diffuse stenosis and RCA 95% mid-distal. Patient status
post bare metal stent to RCA. The patient was started on
aspirin, plavix, and high-dose statin. Metoprolol and enalapril
were initially held for hypotension but restarted one week prior
to discharge. The patient was started on a long-acting nitrate
for prevention of angina. The patient should have a resting MIBI
study as an outpa
