Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 65 y.o male with h.o severe OSA (central/peripheral) s/p
trach who now presents s/p trach dislodgement.
.
# Airway management - Pt with h.o severe OSA who failed trials
of cpap in the past. Pt with trach x15+ yrs per history. Now,
has been a few days w/o trach in place and with evidence of
granulation tissue and healing stoma. IP consulted and
recommended MICU observation o/n.  Rigid bronch was performed
and they were able to balloon dilate the stoma and replace the
trach.  They used the same type as before.  See OMR for
procedure note.  He tolerated the procedure well and came back
to the MICU with his new trach in place and capped.  He was
talking and without pain.  His oxygenation was normal.  IP saw
patient on the floor and cleared him for home with follow up in
two weeks to have the stitch in his trach removed.  He will now
have it exchanged in office visits rather than at home.
