FINDINGS: A single portable image of the chest was obtained and
compared to the prior examination dated [**2122-2-20**]. In the
interim, an endotracheal tube has been placed that terminates
approximately 9 cm above the carina. The image is slightly
underpenetrated. There is a new left pleural effusion. In
addition, suggestion of a new left retrocardiac opacity is
noted, likely secondary to the underlying effusion and
atelectasis, difficult to exclude pneumonia. The right
hemithorax is relatively clear.

IMPRESSION:

1. Endotracheal tube not in ideal position, consider right
repositioning.

2. New left retrocardiac opacity, likely secondary to a
small-to-moderate size effusion and atelectasis, difficult to
exclude pneumonia.

EKG:

The rhythm is probably sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch
block. Left
anterior fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2121-11-3**]
there has been a marked increase in rate. Otherwise, no
diagnostic interim
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
#  hypoxia:  Patient intially on 4L NC mainting oxygen
saturations of 90%.  Over the course of the first few hours of
his admission, he showed worsening respiratory distress, with
increasing work of breathing.  Patinet was intially started on
BIPAP for non-invasive ventillatory support.  The etiology of
his hypoxia/dyspnea was believed to be most likely secondary to
a COPD flare.  He demonstrated wheezes on chest exam with poor
pair movement consistent with an obstructive etiology.  Patient
with negative LENIS, and given such a low suspicison of PE, CTA
was not pursued.  He had negative cardiac enzymes x 3, and no
evidence of fluid overload on CXR.  Patient was intubated on the
second day of admission due to increasing hypercapnea and
increased work of breathing that was not believed to be
sustainable.  The patient showed improved ABG on ventilator,
with a blood gas that was believed to be consistent with his
baseline of CO2 retention.  The patient remained intubated for 6
days.  During the ce course, he was continued on steroids,
freqent nebulizer treatments, and started on levoquin for
empiric atypical coverage.  Invectious etiology, and more
specifically viral cause, was believed to be the inciting factor
to his COPD exacerbation.  CXR showed no frank infiltrates,
sputum Cx showed no growth, and the patient was DFA negative.
Patient began to show evidence of fluid overload on exam and
CXR, and was diuresed with resolution. The patient showed
improvement on physical exam and ease of oxygentation, and was
ultimatly extubated.  Following extubation the patient showed
worsened wheezes and the need for continued BIPAP.  When the
possibility of re-intubation was addressed, the patient refused.
 Prednisone was continued with plans for a slow taper.  He is
being discharged to hospice with BIPAP. on CPAP.  Patient
hyperventilating w/ anxiety.

#Anxiety:  Patient notably anxious following extubation, with
hypertension, tachycarida, and hyperventilation.  These symptoms
were somewhat improved on anxietylitics and plan is to discharge
patient on morphine and ativan.

#cardiac:  Again, given shortness of breath and LE edema, some
concern of MI at time of admission.  The patient had cardiac
enzymes negative x three.  He was intially started on ASA, which
was proptly discontinued.

#Diastolic HF:  Patient has previously carried the diagnosis.
Had LE edema on admission, but not signs of fluid overload on
CXR.  During the admission, patient showed worsened evidence of
fluid overlaod, and was successfully diruesed.  The patient will
be discharged on a maintence dose of lasix that may require
further adjustment.

# HTN:  The patient has a history of hypertension.  He was
continued on his home lisinopril/HCTZ, and BP was well
controlled.

#LE edema/erythema:  On admission, the patient was noted to have
left lower extremity erythema.  Unclear if cellulites vs.
changes from venoustasis.  The patient had no elevation of WBC
or LE edema.  He was started on vanc because of concern of it
looking worsened in intesnity.  With blood cultures negative and
low probablity concern of MRSA, the patient was continued on
levoquin feeling that it would offer adquate coverage.  The
patient showed marked improvement with antibiotics and diuresis.


#Leg Mass:  Patient with fungating black mass on right ankle.
Some concern of melanoma, and dermatology was consulted.  The
differential diagnosis for these lesions includes
lymphangiectasia, angiokeratoma, pyogenic granuloma, venous [**Doctor Last Name **]
or an atypical kaposi's sarcoma. Bx is needed to rule out KS.
The
clinical presentation is not consistent with melanoma.
Recommened shave biopsy as an outpatient.

#Disposition:  The patient requested to not be intubated, and
given the progressed nature of his end stage COPD, the decision
was made with the patient and his family to be discharged to
hospice.
