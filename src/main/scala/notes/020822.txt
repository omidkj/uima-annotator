Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular central venous catheter, left subclavian
central venous catheter

History of Present Illness:
61yo female with history of neurofibromatosis, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, and recent hospitalization for complicated pna,
pancreatitis, c-diff colitis and adrenal insufficiency who
presents with GI bleed, hypotension and hypoxia.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health when she was found
to have decreased responsiveness at her nursing home.  She had a
similar presentation about 1 month ago and was found to be
septic.  Given this concern, she was brought to the ED for
further evaluation.
.
On arrival to the ED, the patient was thought to be hypoxic
however she had clear lung sounds and was breathing comfortably.
 She was initially placed on NRB but was quickly weaned to NC
and sats remained stable.  Her mental status, however, did not
improve.  Patient was also found to be hypotensive in the ED and
was briefly started on levophed with improvement in her BP.  She
received vancomycin and ceftriaxone given concern for sepsis and
got 4L IV fluids.  She had melanotic stool in the ED so she was
started on protonix gtt and received 2U pRBCs in the ED.  GI
aware of the patient.  Labs pertinent for [**Last Name (un) **], elevated
potassium, elevated lactate and troponin.  UA positive for UTI.
WBC of 31.4.
.
The patients mental status improved so she was not intubated.
Triple lumen and arterial lines were placed.  She denied any
localizing symptoms.  EKG showed deep anterior t-wave
inversions.  She remained afebrile in the ED.
.
On arrival to the MICU, T: 95.4 BP: 128/57 P: 77 R: 16 O2: 100%
on NC.  Patient was oriented and had no acute complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
61yo female with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and recent
hospitalization for complicated pna, pancreatitis, c-diff
colitis and adrenal insufficiency who presents with GI bleed,
hypotension and hypoxia.

#1: Anemia, GI bleed.
Patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of a
GI bleed. The patient required multiple transfusions of packed
red [**Month/Day/Year **] cells. Her hematocrit stabilized. There is no source
of bleeding visualized on the CT of the abdomen and pelvis upon
admission. Laboratory evaluation was not significant for
hemolysis. GI consultation felt that she was mostly suffering
from a GI bleed however did not feel that an EGD or colonoscopy
was indicated due too severe to clinical status. The patient had
a second episode of melena with a drop in her hematocrit 2 days
prior to death. Patient was transfused with 3 more units of
packed red [**Month/Day/Year **] cells, 2 platelet transfusions, one fresh
frozen plasma.

#2: Sepsis
patient presented with leukocytosis as well as elevated lactate
and hypotension. Patient does have a history of known C.
difficile infection. Her [**Month/Day/Year **] cultures that were initially
drawn in the emergency were positive. Patient was treated with
linezolid, IV vancomycin, meropenem. Eventually the IV
vancomycin was discontinued as well as her meropenem. This
course was complicated by continued elevations of her lactate as
well as white [**Month/Day/Year **] cell count after initial improvement. Repeat
[**Month/Day/Year **] culture showed gram-negative rods. The patient was
restarted on meropenem. The patient's pressure support
requirements increased prior to that. As for source of her
sepsis it was not initially clear. Patient has possibly an
intra-abdominal infection although there was no source of
infection found on CT of the abdomen. Patient was treated for
questionable ventilator associated pneumonia.

#3: Altered mental status
the patient's mental status was altered throughout her stay.
Although the patient was on sedatives for her intubation status
we eventually were able to discontinue sodas it without return
of patient's normal baseline mental status. She does have
underlying dementia however per her family her mental status is
worse. And neurologic consultation was obtained and they were
unable to give a clear etiology as she has multiple medical
problems currently. [**Name2 (NI) 6**] EEG was performed showing diffuse lower
legs but no specific evidence of nonconvulsive status
epilepticus.

#4: Direct hyperbilirubinemia.
Throughout her stay her bilirubin as well as LFTs alkaline
phosphatase became elevated. Was suggestive of obstructive or
cholestatic process. Right upper quadrant ultrasound was
obtained and did not show any intrahepatic obstruction but the
CBD was not visualized. Possibly secondary to the mass effect of
her pseudocyst. Surgery evaluated the patient and stated that a
HIDA scan would most likely not be useful due to her severe
clinical condition that would prevent any surgical intervention.
He discontinued all about toxic medications to help improve her
liver function.

#5: coagulopathy
The patient will coagulopathy as her liver function
deteriorated. Her INR was increased to above 2. After her second
episode of GI bleed the patient was given fresh frozen plasma to
improve her coagulation status. Her INR did improve to 1.7.

#6: C. difficile colitis.
Patient has a known history of C. difficile colitis. She had a
negative toxin by PCR was positive. The patient was treated with
p.o. vancomycin as well as IV Flagyl.
