History of Present Illness:
57 F admitted for cardiac arrest. Pt was at bar earlier today
and suddently collapsed. Two EMT's were at the bar and
immediately started CPR. Pt was pulseless. Pt found to be in VT,
V fib, and polymorphic VT (as documented in strips, unclear of
the order of these rhythms) and was intubated and shocked seven
times, given epi and atropine in the field. Arrived at OSH and
EKGs revealed Vtach with rate at 108 as well as sinus tachy at
104 with 1mm ST elevation in V1, and 2mm ST depression in V4-V6,
TWI in III. Pt given amiodarone 900mg bolus and drip, sodium
bicarb, zosyn 4.5 g, vecuronium 20mg, and heparin drip, dopamine
drip, dobutamine drip.
Vitals at OSH shortly after arrival: BP 116/89, HR 107, T 97.8.
Prior to transfer she was started on cooling protocol (via ice
packs). Drug tox negative for cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol.
Per report, pt had some posturing while on [**Location (un) **].
.
Pt was transfered to this hospital for arctic cooling protocol.
Upon transfer, vitals were T=30.4C, HR 105, BP 93/58 (on
dopamine), 100% on CMV mode 40%, 450, f16, PEEP 5.

Cardiac Catheterization [**2121-12-3**]
1. Coronary artery disease in this right dominant system
revealed two
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no significant
disease.
The LAD had a 99% lesion in the proximal portion involving the
D1
origin, with a 70% mid-LAD after the D2 origin, and diffuse
disease
distally.  The LCX had minimal luminal irregularities.  The RCA
was
totally occluded proximally, with a distal vessel filling via
left-to-right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic hypertension,
with SBP of
158 mmHg.
.
ECHO [**2121-12-9**]
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 - 35 %), with inferior, septal and
antero-septal HK.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB:
The patient is in SR on no inotropes.
Improved LV systolic fxn. EF now 40 - 45%.
Preserved RV systolic fxn.
Mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Aorta intact.
.
CT Scan ABD/PELVIS [**2121-12-2**]
1. Bilateral pleural effusions with mild pulmonary edema.
2. Markedly thickened gallbladder wall without secondary signs
of acute
cholecystitis likely from acute hepatic dysfunction. Small gall
stones noted
.
Carotid Duplex Ultrasound [**2121-12-5**]
Impression: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA 40-59% stenosis.

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal to mid

ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
