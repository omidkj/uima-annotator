Service: MED

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BIPAP

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year old woman admitted [**2106-10-5**] with left
lower lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis, hypoxia (oxygen
saturation 75% on 2L O2 by nasal cannula), and transient
hypotension that responded to IV fluids in the Emergency
Department. During this admission, she was treated with
levofloxacin for pneumonia, she had pre-renal azotemia that
resolved with hydration, and she ruled out for myocardial
infarction by cardiac enzymes. The day of admission, she was
discharged to a rehabilitation hospital, but she returned to the
Emergency Department 3 hours later with dyspnea and hypoxia. In
the Emergency Department she was found to have a room air oxygen
saturation of 82%; she remained hypoxic on supplemental O2
(80-84% on a high-flow face mask)and was eventually placed on
BiPAP with resolution of her hypoxia. She was admitted to the
MICU for continued BiPAP. Her course there was stable and she
was sent to the floor for the remainder of her hospitalization.
Of note, the hypoxemia was always asymptomatic.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year old woman with extensive cardiac
history admitted with hypoxia of unclear etiology following five
day hospitalization for possible pneumonia.

1. Hypoxia: Differential diagnosis included pneumonia
inadequately treated by levofloxacin, Congestive Heart Failure
exacerbation, or pulmonary embolism. What was curious was the
lack of an explanation of her hypoxia on her portable chest x
ray done in the ED. There was no clear infiltrate, and there was
no evidence of pulmonary edema. If the patient did recently have
a pneumonia, she presumably had a community acquired pneumonia
that should have responded to a course of levofloxacin, although
treatment failure must be considered. Her pulmonary examination
was remarkably clear; there were no crackles to suggest a CHF
exacerbation, although there was 1+ pitting bilateral lower
extremity edema at admit. The oral mucosa was dry, however, and
her composite picture did not suggest a CHF exacerbation. Risk
factors for PE primarily include a recent hospitalization;
although she should take warfarin chronically, her INR is
subtherapeutic. She has no known h/o malignancy, although it is
not clear if she is fully up to date on her cancer screening
(mammography, colonoscopy, Pap smears if indicated). Given the
lack of a finding that would explain her hypoxia on her pCXR,
CT-A was obtained which did not show pulmonary embolism. She was
empirically treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin; although
there is no compelling evidence of pneumonia or infiltrate on
CXR. This therapy was eventually stopped when there was no clear
evidence of an infectious process.

Pulmonary function tests were obtained which were more
consistent with a restrictive picture by flow volume curves and
with an FEV1/FVC ratio of 147% of expected. Also her DLCO was
61% of expected, which is consistent with an element of
decreased permeability to oxygen, for instance from emphysema
which most older adults eventually develop. Of note, Ms.
[**Known lastname **] is on albuturol and ipratropium MDI for unknown
reasons since she has no history of obstruction. On exam, she
has mild wheezes but even so, these medications may not
contribute much. She does have kyphoscoliosis which would
contribute to a restrictive picture.

Notably, a bubble study was obtained which showed a right to
left shunt which was present with Valsalva maneuvers and cough.
This finding may also partially explain the patient's
longstanding hypoxemia. Clinically, Ms. [**Known lastname 109159**] oxygen
requirement decreased and she was weaned to nasal cannula and
sent to the wards from the intensive care unit. Lastly, the
patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea which likely
also contributes to the desaturations at night.

2. CHF: Most recent TTE from [**7-14**] shows an ejection fraction of
30%, significant pulmonary regurgitation, and multifocal AK/HK.
As noted above, no signs or symptoms aside from hypoxia and BLE
edema to suggest CHF exacerbation, but cannot exclude diagnosis
entirely. She was ruled out for an MI as a trigger of CHF
exacerbation. A small troponin leak was identified and thought
to represent her poor clearance from CRI and CHF as well.
Metoprolol was started as was lisinopril for afterload
reduction. (She was on home Toprol XL and lisinopril at one time
recently). With her EF of 30%, spironolactone was continued. Her
atorvastatin was continued.

3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has a longstanding
history of this but was not therapeutic on her warfarin at
admission. She was started on a heparin drip while her coumadin
was adjusted. The warfarin was titrated up when her INR did not
reach goal [**2-13**] and she was discharged on 6 QHS with instructions
to follow up with her PCP for close supervision. Her amiodarone
was continued at the outpatient dose.

5. Hypothyroidism: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a history of thyroid
resection and so her levothyroxine was continued.

6. Chronic Low Back Pain: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has back pain, which may
be caused by her kyphoscoliosis. Her home regimen of fentanyl
patch, darvon, and Tylenol was continued.

7. Hypoparathyroidism: The outpatient regimen of calcium,
calcitonin, and vitamin D was continued.

8. Constipation: Ms. [**Known lastname 109159**] outpatient regimen of
lactulose, senna, docusate was continued.

9. GERD: The patient was started on pantoprazole, and her home
ranitidine was discontinued.

10. Neuropathic Pain: The diagnosis was unclear, but the
gabapentin was continued.

11. Urinary Retention: Bladder scans revealed as much as 800 cc
of urine in her bla
