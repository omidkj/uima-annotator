Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

None


History of Present Illness:
60 yo female with extensive past medical history including
endocarditis, AVR, TVR, PE/DVT, DM2, mild MR, HTN, h/o CHB s/p
PPM placement who presents from Rehab facility with 2 wk
complaint of chest pain.  She describes the chest pain as
occuring at rest.  She describes it as pressure.  She denies
radiation.  She also describes it as [**4-15**], though currenlty she
states her back pain is bothering her much more than her chest
pain.  She denies any fevers or chills.  She does report some
lower abdominal pain as well.  She denies cough, dysuria, BRBPR,
or melena.  She denies HA, rash.  She also reports some mild
palpitations.  She states that over the last few weeks, she
feels more SOB, particularly with exertion.  She also reports
she had some edema in her legs, but improved with lasix.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.1, 120, 129/78, 15, 100%. Patient
was given Vancomycin 1 gm, morphine 2mg IV x 3, GI cocktail.
She had a CTA which did not show PE.  She also had CT abd/pelvis
without any acute pathology.  She was afebrile in the ED.  She
was intially to be admitted to medical floor, but given
persistent tachycardia despite 2 L IVFs, she was admitted to the
ICU for further monitoring.  Lowest recorded BP was 94/54.

Other Studies:
[**2108-6-19**] CXR: 1. No pneumothorax. 2. Stable right mid lung
opacity, better seen on prior CT.

[**2108-6-19**] CT abd/pelvis and CTA: 1. No evidence for pulmonary
embolus or acute aortic syndrome. 2. Multifocal mixed solid and
ground glass opacities within the right lung, suboptimally
evaluated, but not grossly changed compared to prior studies.
These are of uncertain etiology, although a chronic or inactive
infectious process secondary to histoplasmosis or other fungal
organism is a possible consideration. Given the lack of interval
change, neoplasm is unlikely. 3. No acute intra-abdominal
process. Chronic changes including cholelithiasis, calcified
splenic aneurysm, and hypodense lesion within the spleen from
prior abscess are redemonstrated. 4. Small fat-containing
umbilical hernia.

[**2108-6-20**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. An eccentric jet of moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is
present. The leaflets are not well seen, but the gradient is
increased (mean 6mmHg). Mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-9-23**], the transtricuspid
gradient is higher and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation
and mitral regurgitation are reduced.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define
the tricuspid valve prosthesis and severity of mitral
regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 60 yo female with h/o endocarditis, AVR, TVR, CHB s/p
PPM placement, DVT/PE on anticoagulation, mental retardiation,
hypertension, DM2, who presented with chest pains, peristent
tachycardia, and mild hypotension now resolved.
.
# Chest pain: On admission to the hospital the patient had chest
pain. An EKG was performed which showed no ischemic changes,
however difficult to interpret given RBBB/LAFB. Three sets of
cardiac enzymes were negative. Patient had a therapeutic INR so
PE was less likely. CTA was also not consistent with PE. An ECHO
was performed which showed LVEF of 50-55% and improved
regurgitation across the Tricuspid/Mitral valve. The ECHO did
not reveal any etiology for chest pain. Episodes of tachycardia
patient experienced while admitted may have contributed to this
chest pain.
.
# Tachycardia: Patient on admission was tachycardic. EP service
interogatted the patient's pacemaker and found the patient to be
in a triggered fascicular tachycardia. She has mild palpitations
with this rhythm but BP is stable. This rhythm was broken by
placing a magnet over the pacemaker. She had multiple other
episodes of fascicular tachycardia during this admission.  In
each, the patient was asymptomatic with normal blood pressure.
Verapamil was not effective in controlling the tachycardia, and
she was switched to propafenone on [**6-25**] with no further
episodes.  She underwent a stress test to evaluate QRS duration
(routine with propafenone initiation) by increasing the pacer
rate to 110. There was no lengthening of the QRS complex noted
with increased heart rates. She will have a pacer interrogation
and f/u with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from EP in [**Month (only) 216**].
