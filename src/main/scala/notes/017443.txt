CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Bilateral lower extremity rash and pain and
cough.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
white male with an extensive past medical history including
metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with metastases to the
skull, status post radiation therapy times 18, and metastases
to right iliac crest.

The patient was initially diagnosed with non-small-cell lung
cancer after banging his head in [**2104-5-7**].  The incident
led to a hematoma which was drained and found to have
metastatic non-small cells which were later to be found from
a lung primary.  The patient underwent 18 rounds of radiation
therapy to the skull as well as one round of chemotherapy
with gemcitabine and carboplatin on [**2104-9-2**].

Shortly after chemotherapy, the patient developed bilateral
lower extremity pain and an erythematous rash.  The rash was
nonpruritic.  It was tender to the touch.  There was some
relief with Tylenol.  The rash is isolated to shins and
ankles and is unchanged in size and distribution over the
last few days prior to admission.  However, the patient notes
an increase in the erythema of the rash.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems the patient also
complains of a productive cough with yellow sputum times
several weeks.  He has a history of significant chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease with multiple flares and is
currently on a number of inhalers at home.  He denies
associated shortness of breath, fevers, chills, chest pain,
nausea, or vomiting.  He endorses increased fatigue and
general malaise since chemotherapy was initiated.

In the Emergency Department, he was given one dose of
[**Year (4 digits) **] for a low-grade fever; and in addition to the rash,
thought possible cellulitis.

The patient was initially admitted to the Internal Medicine
Service on the [**Hospital Ward Name **].  During the first four days of
hospitalization, the patient developed progressive azotemia,
urinary retention, and hypotension with systolic blood
pressures reaching the middle 70s.  The patient was also
noted to have a deterioration of mental status over this time
period.  On hospital day four, he was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit.

His Intensive Care Unit course was unremarkable, and his
hypotension and urinary retention resolved with intravenous
fluid administration.

After three days in the Intensive Care Unit, he was
transferred to the [**Hospital6 733**] Internal Medicine
Service.

Specific occurring in the Intensive Care Unit and previous
Medicine Service will be discussed in more detail below.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
on admission to the Emergency Department revealed vital signs
with a temperature of 100.7, blood pressure was 112/72, heart
rate was 100, respiratory rate was 24.  On physical
examination the patient was in mild discomfort, in no
apparent respiratory distress.  He was alert and oriented
times three.  His scalp was notable for frontal prominence
with cavitation.  His pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light.  His extraocular muscles were intact.  His
oropharynx was clear.  His mucous membranes were moist, and
his neck was supple.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His heart was regular in rate with occasional
periods of irregularity with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur
at the left sternal border.  He had a normal first heart
sound with a loud metallic second heart sound.  His abdomen
was soft and nontender, with a large ventral hernia and two
well-healed surgical scars.  He had 2+ dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibialis pulses, and 2+ pitting edema in the
bilateral left extremities.  His bilateral shins were notable
for an erythematous maculopapular rash with shiny skin.
There were scattered petechiae in the area.  The rash was
blanching.  Both legs were more tender and warm.  He had a
scar on his left chest from prior melanoma excision which was
atrophic with telangiectasia and a pigmented border.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on
admission revealed white blood cell count was 4.9, hematocrit
was 30.3, and platelets were 64.  INR was 2.7.  Sodium was
134, potassium was 4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 28,
blood urea nitrogen was 31, creatinine was 1, blood glucose
was 123.  Urinalysis was within normal limits without any
hematuria.

PERTINENT STUDIES DURING THIS ADMISSION:  Bilaterally lower
extremity Doppler studies revealed no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis.

A chest x-ray on [**2104-9-12**] (on admission) showed
increased opacity in the region of the right hilum consistent
with known right lung mass.  Focal consolidation in the
region could not be excluded.

A CT of the chest on [**2104-9-16**] showed interval
enlargement of obstruction in the right lower lobe lung mass
with a collapse of superior segment as well as interval
increase in bulk in right hilar and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.  Low attenuation fossae in the liver which
could represent metastatic disease.

A CT of the head on [**2104-9-17**] was normal.

A CT of the cervical spine, and lumbar spine, and thoracic
spine on [**2104-9-17**] was without evidence of
metastatic involvement of the spinal canal or stenosis.

Plain films of the bilateral left extremities showed no
evidence of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 67-year-old male with non-small-cell
lung cancer diagnosed in [**2104-5-7**] with metastases to skull
and possibly the liver; status post aortic valve replacement
secondary to rheumatic heart disease, on Coumadin, congestive
heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and a history
of gastrointestinal bleed presenting with cough times two
weeks as well as lower extremity rash and pain following
chemotherapy treatment on [**2104-9-2**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient with newly diagnosed
non-small-cell lung carcinoma in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year with
metastases to the skull, right iliac, and possibly to the
liver.  During this hospitalization, an interval increase in
the size of mass was noted by both a CT of the chest as well
as increase in hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Although the patient complained of a frequent cough, he had
no respiratory distress on admission.  He was started on
[**Month (only) **] for possible postobstructive pneumonia.  A
bronchoscopy was performed on [**2104-9-19**] which
demonstrated complete obstruction of
