Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 year old male with past medical history significant
for CAB s/p CABG in [**2111**] (LIMA-LAD and SVG-OM), dyslipidemia,
peripheral vascular disease (s/p multiple stents to bilateral
iliacs, femoral), hypertension, s/p CVA, left carotic artery
occlusion who presents with crescendo shortness of breath and
chest pressure.  Three days prior to admission, the patient was
awakened from sleep short of breath, diaphoretic, and with 3/10
chest pressure radiating to both shoulders.  These symptoms
resolved upon sitting up.  Similar episodes ocurred more
frequently over the next few days, and the patient decided to
seek medical attention.  He denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, lower extremity edema, increased abdominal girth.  He has
been sleeping with 2 pillows, which is unchanged.  At baseline,
the patient is able to walk without shortness of breath or chest
pressure.  At the OSH ED, he was noted to be hypertensive and
mildly hypoxic.  CXR showed mild to moderate CHF/pulmonary
edema.  Initial EKG was NSR, 92BPM, slight ST depression
inferolaterally.  Initial troponin was .309.  Repeat troponin 8
hours later was 3.07 with CPK of 159.  Repeat EKG revealed
inverted T waves across the precordium.  He was given Lasix and
nitroglycerin with complete symptom relief.  Despite improvement
in cardiac symptoms, the patient experienced black heme positive
stools with a HCT drop from 31.7 to 25.  He received 2 units
PRBC.  The GI service was consulted who deferred endoscopy until
completion of cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**].

Brief Hospital Course:
* CAD: In light of significant family history, other cardiac
risk factors, known CAD s/p CABG, crescendo shortness of breath
and chest pressure, positive troponin, and EKG changes, the
patient was sent to cardiac catheterization.  His cardiac
catherization demonstrated a right dominant system with 80%
stenosis of the LMCA distally, bilateral 60% renal artery
re-stenoses along with a diffuse 40% occlusion of his left
subclavian resulting in 50 mmHg drop in his peripheral blood
pressures compared to his central blood pressure.  He also had
an elevated PCWP of 35 mm Hg. He was thus admitted to the CCU
for agressive blood pressure management and diuresis with lasix
and niseritide.  On return to the floor, the patient continued
to have poorly controlled hypertension and recurrent congestive
heart failure exacerbations.  Lasix and niseritide were employed
again with good effect.  After several family meetings to
explain the [**Hospital 228**] medical status to both the patient himself
and his family, the patient agreed to accept home oxygen
supplementation in light of his tenous fluid status.  He will be
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks to discuss renal MRA and
possible vascular intervention because it was not possible to
accurately assess the patient's renal arteries with ultrasound.


* HYPERTENSION: The patient had difficult to control
hypertension as documented above.  The patient was discharged on
maximal doses of blood pressure medications with the exception
of starting an ace-inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **] in light of his poor renal
function secondary to renal artery stenosis.  The patient's
underlying etiology of hypertension is unclear but likely
related to renal artery stenosis.  This issue will be addressed
as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 14966**], the patient's
cardiologists.

* PUMP: The patient had a cardiac echo which demonstrated an EF
of 60-65% and a moderately dilated atrium.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed severely elevated left and right sided
filling pressures which were indicative of the congestive heart
failure described above.

* RHYTHM: The patient had no episodes of arrythmias.

* GI BLEED/ANEMIA: The patient reportedly had a Hct drop from 35
to 27.5 at the OSH.  There was no evidence of GI bleeding at
this hospital.  Further analysis of the patient's Hct over the
last few years reveals a chronic anemia.  The patient was
transfused a total of 4 units while in the unit and just prior
to discharge.  In the long term, it may be considered to send
the patient for colonoscopy or endoscopy to evaluate for GI
pathology that could account for chronic slow bleeding.  With
respect to etiology of the patient's chronic anemia, iron
studies are pending at the time of this discharge summary.

* ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: After his cardiac
catherization the patient's creatinine rose to a peak of 3.8
from his admission creatinine 1.8.  With aggressive diuresis,
the patient's dye nephropathy resolved and creatinine returned
to his baseline of 1.6 pr
