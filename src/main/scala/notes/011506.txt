Pertinent Results:
CATH [**6-11**]: (see full report for details) 1. Three vessel and left
main coronary artery disease. 2. Moderate LV systolic and
diastolic dysfunction. 3. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
CNIS [**6-12**]: 1. Significant inflow (iliac) arterial disease in the
right lower extremity. No evidence of arterial insufficiency in
the left lower extremity. 2. Less than 40% stenosis was
demonstrated in the right internal carotid artery. 3. 40-59%
stenosis was demonstrated in the left internal carotid artery.
Renal U/S [**6-12**]: 1. Narrowing of the proximal SMA with an elevated
peak systolic velocity. 2. No radiographic evidence of renal
artery stenosis bilaterally. 3. Slightly enlarged spleen.
CT abd/pelvis [**6-13**]: Atherosclerotic changes of the aorta and its
abdominal branches, including the origin of SMA and celiac axis
with some narrowing without evidence of occlusion.
Echo [**6-15**]: PRE-CPB: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed LVEF 30-35%. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
root, ascending aorta,aoritc arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. POST-CPB: Improved LV systolic
function on inotropic support. LVEF now 40-45%. Basal
inferiorseptum now hypokinetic. Mild MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] systolic
function.
CXR [**6-17**]: 1. Moderate cardiomegaly with resolving mild
interstitial pulmonary edema. 2. Bibasilar atelectasis with
small bilateral pleural effusions. 3. No pneumothorax after
chest tube removal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to cath lab on [**6-11**] where she was noted to
have three vessel disease. Cardiac surgery evaluated her for
bypass and she required extensive work-up prior to surgery.
Please see pertinent results. Found to have some occlusion in
legs that should be evaluated by vascular surgery as outpt.
Following pre-op work-up and surgical consent, she was brought
to the operating room on [**6-15**] where she underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 5. She tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Early on post-op day one she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Later on
this day she was transferred to the cardiac step-down floor.
Diuretics were started and she was gently diuresed towards her
pre-op weight. On post-op day three her epicardial pacing wires
were removed. Physical therapy followed patient during post-op
course for strength and mobility. She appeared to be doing well
without post-op complications and she was discharged home with
VNA services and the appropriate follow-up appointments on
post-op day four.
