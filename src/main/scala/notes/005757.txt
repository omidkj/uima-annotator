Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This is a 36-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for ESRD
(from hypertensive nephropathy) on HD (MWF) who is admitted from
[**Hospital 4199**] Hospital with hemoptysis.  According to patient and OSH
records, patient began experiencing hemoptysis the day prior to
admission (once at 8am and then at 9pm); she went to [**Hospital 4199**]
Hospital that night where she was evaluated and sent home.  The
following day she went to HD where she coughed up 30cc of
rube-red blood in clots.  She was sent to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital where
she had a CTA, which showed PEs in the lower lobe pulmonary
artery branches bilaterally. The RV LV ratio was 1.01 and there
was no septal bowing.  Ms. [**Known lastname 55366**] was subsequently transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were: HR 70, 98/54, 12, 100%RA.
Patient was guaic negative and she was started on a heparin.
She was given vanc and levaquin for GGO on CT scan and question
of HCAP.  After heparin drip was started, patient passed about
100cc of frank hemoptysis.  However, she remained
hemodynamically stable and maintained her airway.  On admission
to the MICU, vitals were: 97.8, 68, 97/59, 97% on RA.

Past Medical History:

ECHO [**2201-3-7**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Normal estimated pulmonary pressures.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
This is a 36-year-old woman with a pmhx significant for ESRD on
dialysis, HTN, and anemia who is admitted to the MICU with
bilateral PEs and hemoptysis. Hospital course prolonged by
repair of fistular prior to starting coumadin. Fistula repair
complicated by hematoma.  The patient was ultimately discharged
witha  functioning fistula on coumadin for management of
pulmonary emboli.
.
# HEMOPTYSIS:  Likely in the setting of bilateral PEs. She was
initially sent to the MICU. There she remained hemodynamically
stable. She was started on a heparin gtt for the pulmonary
emboli, and hemoptysis resolved after 24 hours.
.
# BILATERAL PULMONARY EMBOLI:  Unclear etiology of
hypercoagulable state however, there is no clear reversible risk
factor.  Patient denies any long plane rides or periods of
immobility, and she does not take birth control.  Patient denies
any family history or personal history of blood clots.  No known
history of frequent miscarriages. Bilateral upper and lower
extremity ultrasound negative for clots. MRV pelvis showed no
evidence of proximal clots. Hypercoagulable studies showed were
unrevealing for etiology (ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], Protein c and s, ACA Ig and
IgM, lupus anticoagulant, antithrombin, anti-GBM,
methylenetetrahydrofolate). Coumadin was not started immediately
secondary to an effort to revise her prior fistula prior to
initiation of coumadin.  After successful revision of her left
sided fistula, coumadin was started requiring several days of
7.5mg to maintain INR goal [**3-20**].  Her Primary care physician was
notified of the hospitalization, aware of initiation of coumadin
and follow-up scheduled for initiation of coumadin clinic.
.
# ESRD ON HD:  As per dialysis center, patient is on HD because
of hypertensive nephropathy, however ultimate etiology unclear.
She is dialyzed MWF.  However, she is not all that hypertensive,
and TTE shows no evidence of hypertensive changes, calling that
diagnosis into question.  A work-up as part of her
hypercoagulability work-up as outlined above was initiated.  A
biopsy was not pursued given duration on HD.  Her phosphorous
was persistently elevated on calcium high normal.  Calcitriol
was discontinued and sevelamer was started.  Nephrocaps were
continued.
.
# FISTULA REPAIR: Given hospitalization and initiation of HD,
repair of her clotted, non functioning fistula was performed.
Transplant surgery was consulted, venous mapping was performed
and a synthetic graft was placed at the site of her prior
fistula. Fistula repair was complicated by evolution of a
hematoma at the repair site. Several ccs of blood were aspirated
and her pain was controlled with tylenol and oxycodone.  No
prescription pain medications were required at the time of
discharge.
.
# HYPERTENSION:  Held lisinopril in setting of bleed.  She
continued to be hypotensive throughout her hospitalization with
blood pressures in the 90-100s. Lisinopril was held on discharge
to be restarted in the outpatient setting as tolerated.
.
# ANEMIA:  Iron studies confirmed anemia of chronic disease.
Ferrous sulfate was discontinued.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- INR check on the Monday following admission, with PCP
[**Name9 (PRE) 702**] of labs.  PCP office aware of INR check- she will have
lab draw at the office.
- start coumadin and sevelamer, discontinue ferrous sulfate,
lisinopril and calcitriol
- follow-up primary care for initiation of [**Hospital
