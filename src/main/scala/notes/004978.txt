Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2128-1-6**] Exlap, LOA, reduction of volvulus


History of Present Illness:
HPI:  The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of
multiple abdominal operations who was transferred to the
ED from an outside hospital for small bowel obstruction with
possible volvulus.  Last night he had 4 episodes of profuse
vomiting following dinner and this morning was brought to an
outside ED at 6:00.  He was initially believed to be well and
was
almost sent home, but due to significant pain he received a CT
scan which revealed a small bowel obstruction and was
transferred
to the [**Hospital1 **] for further care.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension, coronary artery disease status post stenting in
[**2122**] after an MI, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, asbestos exposure, and ulcer disease.


Social History:
He is married with two adult children.  He is a retired
contractor.  He had a
60-pack/year smoking history, but quit approximately 18 months
ago.  He does not consume any alcohol at the present time.


Family History:
Father died in his 70s (possibly alcohol-related), and his
mother who died of an MI in her 80s.  He has no family history
of colon cancer or any other bile duct cancers.

[**2128-1-6**] 11:03PM BLOOD freeCa-1.24

[**2128-1-5**]:  EKG:

Sinus tachycardia. Left anterior fascicular block. Low limb lead
QRS voltage.
Prior anterior wall myocardial infarction. Baseline artifact
makes assessment difficult. Since the previous tracing of
[**2124-9-25**] sinus tachycardia is now present

[**2128-1-5**]:  Chest x-ray:

Opacification at the right middle/lower lung base consistent
with infectious process such as pneumonia

[**2128-1-6**]: EKG:

Significant baseline artifact. Low voltage in the standard
leads. Sinus
tachycardia, rate 113. RSR' pattern in leads V1-V3 with a QRS
duration
of 86 milliseconds. QS deflections in lead V4 and possible Q
waves in
leads V1-V4. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-1-6**], when
there was also significant baseline artifact, there are ST
segment depressions in the lateral leads V5-V6 which may be more
prominent. Otherwise, no diagnostic interval change. Consider
prior anterior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age

[**2128-1-6**]:  Chest x-ray:

 FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date,
the
endotracheal tube tip appears to have been removed. Nasogastric
tube and
right IJ catheter are essentially unchanged. The change in the
appearance of the right basilar and retrocardiac opacifications
most likely reflects the more upright position of the patient

[**2128-1-8**]:  EKG:

Normal sinus rhythm. There is now a stable baseline. Low voltage
in the
standard leads. Definite Q waves in leads V1-V5 with no R waves
until V5.
T wave inversion in leads V1-V3. Slight ST segment elevation in
lead V4. Prior anterior wall myocardial infarction of
indeterminate age. The rate has slowed compared to tracing #1
and the ST-T wave changes noted in leads V5-V6 are no longer
present. This suggests a regression of myocardial ischemia in
that territory

[**2128-1-8**]:  Chest x-ray:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-6**], the central
catheter and
nasogastric tube have been removed. There is progression of the
bibasilar
opacification, worrisome for bilateral pneumonia with pleural
effusion. Air bronchograms are now seen, especially at the left
base.

Mild fullness of pulmonary vessels suggests some increased
pulmonary venous pressure

Brief Hospital Course:
  79 year old gentleman admitted to the Acute Care Service from
an outside hospital with abdominal pain. Upon admission, he was
noted to be somnolent after having received ativan prior to his
arrival.  He was given a reversal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] which improved his
mental status.  He was made NPO and given intravenous fluids.
His cat scan showed a bowel obstruction. He was emergenly taken
to the operating [****] where he underwent an exploratory
laparotomy, lysis of adhesions and reduction of a volvulus.
  His operative course was stable with 100 cc blood loss. He did
require a short course of neosynephrine during his procedure. He
was extubated in the recovery room. He was transferred to the
floor post-operatively where he had an episode of apnea and
unresponsiveness.  As a result of this, he was transferred to
the Cardiac Care Intensive care unit where he was monitored and
serial cardiac enzymes followed. His troponins have been normal.
He  has had no  events and it was thought that the initial event
was vaso-vagal in nature.
  His vital signs stabilized and on POD #2 he was transferred
out of the intensive care unit. He has had isolated episodes of
increased heart rate which have been controlled with metoprolol.
 His [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube has been discontinued and he has started
a regular diet. He is voiding without diff
