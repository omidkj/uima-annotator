Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thorocentesis [**2130-4-6**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman w/ h/o esophageal ca s/p palliative XRT
ending in [**12-7**], chronic cough, h/o angina and CHF with EF >55%,
who presents with 2 weeks of progressive SOB acutely worse over
that past few days.  Of note, she was recently discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-10**] at which time she was admitted for CHF
exacerbation, was diuresed with improving respiratory status and
was sent home on lasix 10 mg PO QOD.  Since her discharge she
has become progressively SOB, worse over the past 2 weeks and
much worse over the past couple of days. Her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
increased her Flovent dosing and added proventil, which helped
but she began using more and more frequently.   At baseline she
is able to walk around her house with a cane.  She denies CP and
denies any worsening of her LE edema. She reports that on her
last admission they talked to her about getting a thoracentesis
but did not want it at the time as she did not think she could
tolerate the procedure.  She otherwise denies any chest
pain/pressure (her anginal equivalent), PND, palpitations, N/V,
diarrhea, BRBPR, dysuria, fevers.

In the ED, she was noted to have a T 99.0  BP 118/64 RR 24 O2
sats 96% on NRB and then started on BiPAP (setting not
documented) satting 98%. She was started on a nitro drip, given
lasix 30 mg IV x1 with little UOP, combivent nebs, ASA PR.
.
Currently pt states she still feels SOB, denies any CP,
palpitations, abd pain.  She did not feel she can tolerate the
BiPAP mask and feels better on NC and face mask.

Pertinent Results:
[**2130-4-6**] CXR:  1.  CHF with left greater than right pleural
effusions and interstitial edema, significantly worse since
[**2130-3-9**].
2.  Left retrocardiac opacity, likely related to above; focal
consolidation cannot be excluded.
.
[**2130-4-8**] CXR PA/Lat: IMPRESSION: No major change in the appearance
of the previously described pulmonary edema with bilateral
pleural effusions.
.
[**2130-4-11**] CXR: AP: IMPRESSION: Successful left-sided
pleurocentesis without evidence of pneumothorax.
.
Labs:
[**2130-4-6**] Pleural fluid-cytology:  adenocarcinoma- IHC showed
esophageal in origin.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 100726**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of esophageal
cancer s/p palliative XRT in [**12-7**], h/o angina, who presents
with progressive SOB with worsening pleural effusion and
pulmonary edema. She had a brief stay in the MICU upon admission
to the hospital until her respiratory failure stabilized.  She
was then transferred to the medical floor for continued care.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: She was admitted to the MICU with
th ddx for her hypoxic respiratory failure included CHF
exacerbation, malignant pleural effusion, lymphangitic
[**Last Name (LF) 100727**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], worsening renal failure.  She had a
thorocentesis on [**2130-4-6**] which ultimately showed malignant cells
consistent with esophageal adenocarcinoma.  Over 1L of fluid was
removed and she tolerated the procedure well and was less
symptomatic afterwards.  Her oxygen was weened down to a NC and
she was diuresed with furosemide prn.  She was also continued on
ipratropium and fluticasone nebs/IH.  She was then transferred
to the medical floor.  On [**2130-4-11**] she had another thorocentesis
for symptomatic relief and about 800mL was removed at that time.
 This second procedure was more difficult for her to tolerate
and was more painful.  She received some symptomatic relief
afterwards with regards to her breathing.  At discharge she had
stable oxygen saturations in the mid to low 90's on 5L NC.  She
is being discharged with 5L NC, fluticasone IH, and furosemide
10mg daily to help relieve her shortness of breath from fluid
overload.
.
# Malignant pleural effusions: The pleural fluid suggested it
was an exudate (LDH ratio 0.6 (right on the border), protein
ratio 0.58) which was concerning for malignant effusion given
her clinical history.  The cytology returned with esophageal
adenocarcinoma cells and no organisms.  Intervential pulmonology
suggested a pleurex catheter to help drain the fluid.  At this
time, the patient does not want another procedure done.  She
will consider this for symptomatic relief in the future.
.
# ARF: The reason for her acute renal failure was unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **]
Cr was 2.8 on admission (baseline 1.2).  She was likely
intravascularly dry despite her pulmonary edema.  Her Cr
continued to trend down throughout her admission and was 0.9 on
discharge.
.
# Esophageal Ca: She has received palliative XRT in [**12-7**]. The
patient does not have an outpt oncologist. XRT done by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Her cancer and the XRT has made it difficult for her to
eat. She tolerates a liquid diet and can take some medications
as well.  While in the MICU, a palliative care consult was
obtained. Once the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion was
made, the palliative care team and social work helped to
organize home hospice after conversations with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the
attending, and the patient and her son.
.
# Pain control:  She has an allergy to aspirin and acetaminophen
which cause breathing difficulties and rashes.  She was treated
with round the clock ibuprofen liquid solution 400-800mg q8hrs.
For breathrough pain, she was given morphine elixor 2-5mg
q4-6hrs.
.
# ARF: The reason for her acute renal failure was unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **]
Cr was 2.8 on admission (baseline 1.2).  She was likely
intravascularly dry despite her pulmonary edema.  Her Cr
continued to trend down throughout her admission and was 0.9 on
discharge.
.
# Anxiety: Given patient's anxiety/palpitations, we will
discharge her on toprol XL to help with those symptoms.
.
# HTN: The patient was hypotensive initially and then her blood
pressure increased to the low 100's.  Her outpatient medications
were held initially. Metoprolol XL 12.5mg was added back.  Her
SBP remained around 100 and her HR was in the 80's.
.
# GERD: She has a history of hiatal hernia and GERD for which
she often sleeps sitting up in bed to limit the acid reflux.
She took prilosec at home and was switched to lansoprazole
dissolving tabs to help ease her ability to tak
