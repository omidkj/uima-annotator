Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Tetanus,Diphther Toxoid Adult / Aggrenox

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status
Hyperthermia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
peripheral [**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] disease, stroke, CAD, chronic renal failure
who presents with hyperthermia and lethargy. Patient was found
by his wife to be minimally responsive and EMS was called. Per
report, he has a history of similar episodes in the past.
Patient lives on the [**Location (un) 442**] of apartment building, and does
not normally open windows or turn on air conditioning. EMS found
patient minimally responsive and reported that the patient's
home was extremely warm. He was BIBA for further evaluation and
management. He does not remember currently what happened prior
to coming to the hospital, but understands what has happened
since he has been here.
.
In the ED, vital signs were T:104.9 BP:181/80 HR:74 RR:24 O2Sat
100% on RA. He received Demerol. Groin and axilla were packed
with ice and cooling blanket was placed on patient. As
temperature improved to 102 degrees, patient's mental status
improved, temperature was brought down to 98.6 degrees prior to
transfer. Due to concern for sepsis, he received 2 litres IV
fluid and was given 1 dose ceftriaxone. Chest x-ray demonstrated
fluid overload and patient had increased respiratory rate,
therefore he received furosemide 80mg IV, and was also
temporarily started on NIPPV. ABG was done 7.34/39/141.
Non-contrast CT Torso was done to assess for infection and
appeared negative. For refractory hypertension and fluid
overload on chest x-ray, he was started on nitroglycerin gtt,
which was turned off after blood pressure improved. For
hyperkalemia, ECG was unchanged and he received calcium
gluconate 1 gram and Kayexalate 30gm PO. CT head was also
performed and showed no acute process.

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 98.6 BP: 181/58 HR: 72 RR: 20 O2Sat: 94%
Gen: alert and oriented, NAD
Cardiac: RRR, no murmurs
Lungs: CTAB
Abd: soft, NT, +BS
Ext: 2+ oedema BL


Pertinent Results:

Laboratories: Notable for Creatinine of 2.7 (baseline 1.7-2.0),
potassium 6.3, lactate 2.1, UA negative for Leukocyte esterase
or nitrites, WBC 18.5 with 85% PMN and 1% Bands, Hct 30.7
(baseline 34-36), normal liver enzymes. See below for rest.
.
ECG: Sinus rhythm at 76 bpm, left-atrial abnormality, normal
axis, first degree AV conduction delay, normal QT intervals,
poor R-wave progress, no specific ST or T-wave changes, Q-waves
in III and aVF, consistent with prior inferior MI. Patient had
left-bundle morphology IVCD in prior tracing, but QRS width is
124, so now complete LBBB.
.
Imaging:
CXR: Demonstrates cardiomegaly, poor inspiratory effort, hilar
prominence with increased [**Name (NI) 1106**] markings bilaterally, PPM.
.
CT Torso on [**2131-8-2**]: IMPRESSION: 1. No source of infection is
identified on this non-contrast CT. 2. Stable perinephric low
density lesion, likely an exophytic simple renal cyst. 3. New
linear metal density wires within the urinary bladder. Please
correlate with patient's surgical history.
4. Extensive [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] calcifications. 5. L5 spondylolysis
without spondylolisthesis. 6. Stable, nonspecific stranding
around the kidneys bilaterally. 7. Cholelithiasis.
.
CT Head on [**2131-8-2**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial process.
2. Encephalomalacia of the right occipital lobe, consistent with
the
patient's history of right posterior cerebral artery infarct.
3. Stable, subtle, asymmetric low attenuation of the left
temporal lobe, most likely representing chronic small vessel
disease.
.
TTE on [**2131-8-6**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-9-27**],
mild mitral regurgitation is now seen (may be no difference as
image quality is better on the current study).


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 79 year-old male with a history of diabetes,
peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease, stroke, CAD, chronic renal failure
who presents with hyperthermia.

<br>HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
<br>Fevers - Patient presented with fever to 104, which came
down with cooling blankets and ice.  Initially fever was
believed to be hyperthermia (being in a hot room with no A/C in
the summer), but patient re-spiked after cooling which increased
concern about infectious etiology, likely exacerbated by high
room temperatures at home. Temperature did not qualify for heat
stroke (core body temperature did not reach 40.5 centigrade).
His second UA was dirty and CT torso showed foreign body in
bladder, which upon cystoscopy by urology proved to be a copper
wire (the reason it was in his bladder remains unknown).  He was
treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible
complicated/MRSA UTI.  He had one blood culture on [**8-2**] positive
for coag-negative staph in one bottle but this was ultimately
thought to be a contaminant and ceftriaxone was D/Ced at this
point.  The copper wire grew out coag-positive staph which was
speciated as MRSA and was the reason he was initially put on
vancomycin, and this was continued until [**2131-8-8**].  At this point
the vancomycin was D/Ced and switched to bactrim becasue the
copper wire cultures showed the staph was also sensitive to
bactrim.  He also received IV fluid hydration. He was initially
admitted to the ICU at presentation, and once he had defervesced
and was hemodynamically stable he was transferred to the floor.
On the floor, he remained afebrile for the rest of his hospital
course.

<br>Acute on chronic renal failure - Patient presented with
hyperkalemia likely secondary to renal failure. Acute renal
failure was felt to be likely secondary to dehydration and
possibly a component of ATN. FeUrea was >30. Baseline creatinine
seems to be about 1.2 and he is followed in renal clinic as an
outpatient. He peaked at a creatinine of 2.7 and with
resuscitation trended down to 1.5.

<br>Bladder Foreign Body: CT scan showed foreign body in the
bladder which was new since last CT scan in [**2131-4-3**]. Urology
removed a long copper wire from th
