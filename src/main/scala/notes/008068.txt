Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6021**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, hematemesis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic
cancer s/p chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending
cholangitis and malnutrition on TPN, who presents with weakness
and abdominal pain, found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and
also hematemesis in the ED. He initially presented for
evaluation of abd pain, nausea, 3-4 episodes of non-bloody,
non-bilious emesis in the last day to day and a half, and
subjective fevers at home.

In the ED, his initial vitals were remarkable for tachycardia to
130s, SBP 90s; he was afebrile. Because he had reported
subjective fever and was hypotensive, broad spectrum Abx (vanc
and zosyn) were started and, because of his ascites and known
pancreatic CA, CT torso was performed. A CT torso showed that
the patient had b/l PEs, and heparin gtt was started. Shortly
thereafter, he had hematemesis x2 (~1L total) of mixed bright
and dark red blood. Heparin was then stopped, he was transfused
two units of blood, and gen surgery and GI were consulted about
bleeding and thoracics consulted about possible thrombectomy of
PEs. Surgery did not recommend any operative management for
upper GI bleeding and GI recommended supportive care until
morning, when EGD could be performed if pt stabilizes. Thoracics
did not think patient was a good candidate for thrombectomy. In
total, he received 7 liters of NS in the ED, and remained
hypotensive, so he was started on dopamine.

ROS: The patient denies any shaking chills, diarrhea,
constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of
breath, orthopnea, PND, cough, urinary frequency, urgency,
dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness,
vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Past Medical History:
- Pancreatic Ca: Diagnosed in [**8-8**].  He was started on
protocol treatment with TNFerade (injected directly into the
tumor by EGD weekly), 5-FU and Radiation.
- Hx of ascending cholangitis during his last hospital admission
([**Date range (1) 77005**])
- Dysphagia on a pureed and thin liquid diet
- Malnutrition on ensure shakes and megestrol.  Recently started
on TPN.
- Hyperlipidemia
- Diabetes II

Lives with wife, retired.


Family History:
Mother with pancreatitic CA at age 67.

Imaging:
CXR ([**12-20**]):  1. Interval improvement in aeration of the left
lower lobe, with residual patchy opacity likely representing
residual atelectasis. Please note, however, that developing
infection cannot be excluded on this examination, and clinical
correlation is recommended. No sizable residual left-sided
pleural effusion seen.
2. Mild prominence of the interstitial markings within the right
upper lobe, but no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.

CT torso ([**12-20**]):
1. Pulmonary emboli of the right and left main pulmonary
arteries extending into the segmental and subsegmental branches.
2. Bilateral common femoral vein deep venous thrombosis.
3. Unchanged left pleural effusion with underlying atelectasis.
Resolution of right pleural effusion.
4. Large volume ascites, unchanged.
5. Stable mass of the pancreatic head with vascular involvement.
6. Unchanged mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation with
common bile duct stent in place.
7. Pulmonary nodules unchanged in comparison to [**2140-11-29**].

Head CT ([**12-21**]): No intracranial hemorrhage or edema

Chest x-ray [**2140-12-29**]: Small left-sided pleural effusion with
subsequent small left basal hypoventilation. No newly occurred
focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia. Unchanged
size of the cardiac silhouette, bilaterally reduced lung
volumes.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic cancer
status-post chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending
cholangitis and malnutrition on TPN, who presented with weakness
and abdominal pain, found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and
also hematemesis in the ED.

# Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of
chemoradiation with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5
endoscopic US-guided intratumoral injections of TNFerade. Given
his issues with malnutrition and poor functional status further
chemo had been deferred.  After discussion with the patient and
his family given the new diagnosis of bilateral PEs, recent
hematemesis, he initially chose to be made CMO.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4613**], his
outpatient oncologist, met with him as well while he was
hospitalized.  His pain was treated with morphine as needed, his
nausea with zofran and prochlorperazine prn.  Palliative care
was consulted.  The patient preferred to remain in the hospital.
 When transferred to the floor, the primary oncology team and
the palliative care team had another family meeting, reiterating
that there was not further treatment for the patient's
pancreatic cancer.  The family members had a very difficult time
accepting this. Ultimately, the patient decided to change status
back to full code and chose to be discharged with VNA services.

# Hypotension/Shock: The patient presented with shock in the ED.
 Possible etiologies included obstruction from his submassive
PEs; sepsis, from possibly a GI (SBP or gastroenteritis) source;
vs hypovolemic from bleeding. He was volume resuscitated with 7L
NS + 2 units PRBCs in the ED.  He was initially placed on
levophed, however this was weaned off.  His SBPs
