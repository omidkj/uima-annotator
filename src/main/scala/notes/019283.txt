Service: Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old female who
was originally admitted on [**2139-9-26**], with newly diagnosed
aortic stenosis and chest pain.  The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization at that time which showed an ejection
fraction of 26% and no coronary artery disease.  The patient
was discharged from the hospital on [**2139-10-3**], with
instructions to follow-up with cardiac surgery in the office.
On [**2139-10-5**], she had recurrent chest discomfort and shortness
of breath.  The patient went to an outside hospital where she
had an echocardiogram that confirmed her aortic stenosis with
an aortic valve area of 0.5 centimeter square.  The patient
was referred to cardiac surgery for replacement of her aortic
valve.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortic stenosis with aortic valve area of 0.5 centimeter
square.
2.  Congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction,
ejection fraction 26% and diastolic dysfunction by cardiac
catheterization.
3.  History of subendocardial infarction with clean
coronaries and troponin and CK leak on [**2139-10-2**].
4.  Bilateral cataracts.
5.  Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Penicillin which gives
her a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Colace twice a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not speak any English,
speaks French Creole.  She lives with her daughter.  She
denies any history of tobacco, alcohol or drugs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2139-10-8**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an aortic valve replacement
with a 19 millimeter [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **] flow by pericardial
valve.  The patient's ejection fraction in the operating room
was 25 to 30% with significant systolic and diastolic
dysfunction.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition.  Please see operative note for
further details.  On postoperative day number one, the
patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation
without difficulty.  The patient had been placed on
Epinephrine in the operating room for maintenance of cardiac
output.  This was weaned off on postoperative day number one
without difficulty.  The patient remained hemodynamically
stable with adequate cardiac index.  The patient's chest
tubes were removed without difficulty.  On postoperative day
number one, there was a question of the patient having some
right sided weakness, especially right lower extremity,
however, it was difficult to assess due to language barrier
but when the patient's family was in to translate to the
team, it seemed as though the patient had decreased strength
in the right arm and decreased strength and movement in the
right leg.  On postoperative day number two, neurology
consultation was obtained and at the time neurology said it
appeared to have right leg, right arm and facial weakness and
unable to move right lower extremity to commands.  The
patient underwent emergent CT scan of the head which showed no
abnormaly consistent with a stroke.  Neurology recommended
a magnetic resonance scan to further evaluate suspicion of
infarct and also recommended starting anticoagulation.  The
patient was started on Heparin infusion.  The patient's pacing
wires were
removed and the patient's staples closing her sternal
incision were removed so the patient could travel to have a
magnetic resonance scan obtained.  The patient went on
postoperative day number three for a magnetic resonance scan
of her head which showed small area of subcortical infarcts
apparently in the left frontal lobe as well as changes of
small vessel disease and no significant abnormality.  During
this time, the patient developed increasing movement and
strength in her right upper extremity and increasing movement
in her right lower extremity.  After the magnetic resonance
scan, the patient's sternal incision was restapled to close
it and the patient was started on empiric antibiotics for
this.  Neurology again came by and examined the patient after
seeing the results of the magnetic resonance scan and felt
that the findings were consistent with a nonischemic stroke
and recommended the patient having carotid artery ultrasound.
At the time that the patient had the magnetic resonance scan,
they also did a MR angiogram of her head which showed no
intracranial vascular lesion.  The patient was also noted to
have fevers on postoperative day number one, two and three.
On postoperative day number one, the patient's temperature
maximum was 102.  On postoperative day number two, the
patient's temperature maximum was 101 and after that, the
patient had low grade fevers of 100.  On postoperative day
number four, neurology reread the results of the magnetic
resonance scan and felt that a diffusion weighted study
demonstrated that the lesion in the left temporal area were
in the distribution of the anterior and middle cerebral
artery, border zone subcortically consistent with an embolic
pattern.  Recommended continuing with the Heparin drip.  The
patient had a carotid ultrasound which demonstrated no flow
limiting stenosis in either carotid.  The patient had
continued to be hemodynamically stable off all drips
receiving beta blockers and diuretics, tolerating both of
these well, and it was determined that the patient was stable
for transfer to the floor.  The patient began working with
physical therapy and it was felt by physical therapy that the
patient would benefit from acute rehabilitation.  The
neurology service recommended on postoperative day number
five that the patient did not have any indications for
anticoagulation simply from the stroke and recommended
discontinuing the Heparin and placing the patient on Plavix
and Aspirin as well as Lipitor.  On postoperative day number
six, it was determined the patient was cleared for discharge
to acute rehabilitation facility and the patient will be
discharged to rehabilitation on [**2139-10-15**].
