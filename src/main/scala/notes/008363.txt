IMAGING:
CTA Head [**3-23**]
1. 3-mm bilobed aneurysm projecting anteromedially at the
junction of the
ACOM and left A2 segment with diffuse subarachnoid and
intraventricular
hemorrhage. Though ventricles are prominent, they appear
appropriate in size for the patient's age of 81 years without
definite evidence of hydrocephalus.
2. No acute territorial infarction.

CT Head [**3-24**]:
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, stable in appearance and extent

since the previous study. Small amount of layering hemorrhage
within the
occipital horns, unchanged. No evidence of hydrocephalus.

CTA/CTP [**3-25**]:
1. CT head demonstrates interval coiling with coil artifact in
the region of anterior communicating artery. No hydrocephalus.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation in the left anterior cerebral artery
distribution.
2. CT perfusion of the head demonstrates increased mean transit
time and
decreased blood volume in the left anterior cerebral artery
territory
indicative of acute infarct.
3. CT angiography of the head demonstrates occlusion of the A2
segment of the left anterior cerebral artery. No evidence of
vasospasm or other vascular occlusions are seen. Status post
embolization of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

CXR [**2101-3-29**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-28**], the monitoring and support
devices remain in place. There is persistent enlargement of the
cardiac
silhouette with bilateral effusions and basilar atelectasis.
More focal area of opacification at the left base could
represent a region of developing pneumonia.

CTA [**2101-3-29**]
1. Redemonstration of the subacute infarction involving the
vascular territory of the left anterior cerebral artery, the
area of
infarction appears more conspicuous with no evidence of
hemorrhagic
transformation or significant shifting of the normally midline
structures.
There is minimal mass effect in the left frontal ventricular
[**Doctor Last Name 534**].
2. Interval decrease in the amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No new areas of ischemia are identified.
3. The CTA demonstrates lack of filling of the left anterior
cerebral artery at the level of the A2 segment. Streak artifact
related with coils obscures anatomical detail in this area.
There is no evidence of diffuse or focal vasospasm.

CTA [**2101-3-31**]
1. Redemonstration of subacute infarction of the left anterior
cerebral
artery vascular territory. No evidence of hemorrhagic
transformation.
Unchanged mild mass effect on the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
2. Similar amount and distribution of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage.
3. No evidence of vasospasm. Unchanged lack of filling of the
left anterior cerebral artery at the level of the A2 segment.
Streak artifact from the coils again obscures the anatomical
detail in this area.

CXR [**2101-4-2**]
The lungs are hyperinflated. The heart is enlarged. There are
small-to-
moderate left greater than right pleural effusions, with
underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Minimal upper zone
redistribution, but no overt CHF.
An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.
A left
subclavian central line is present, tip over proximal SVC.
Compared with [**2101-4-1**], I doubt significant interval change


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted under the neurosurgery service to the
ICU for Q1 neuro checks. Her blood pressure was kept from
120-140, and she was placed on nimodipene for vasospasm
prophylaxis.  On [**3-24**] she went to the angio suite for coiling of
the ACOMM aneurysm;  however, the patient suffered a left sided
infarct during the procedure due to a dislodged coil.

She returned to the ICU and had a worsening exam; she was
completely plegic on the RU and RL extremities, and moved
spontaneously on the left.  Her blood pressure was kept below
140. She developed labored breathing throught the day on [**3-25**]
and into [**3-26**], but remained on nasal cannula only

A discussion was had with the family regarding the patient's
code status.  They wised to make the patient DNR/DNI, as the
patient had previously stated wishes of not being intubated or
having any extreme interventions or procedures.

On [**4-1**] patient opens eyes spontaneously and moves LUE
spontaneously. There is a question if patient is able to track
the examiner. She briskly withdraws LLE and no movement on R
side. Her CTA showed no evidence of vasospasm and patient was
transferred to step down. A PT eval was also requested.

On [**4-2**] a u/a was obtained but results were questionable,
therefore we awaited a culture before starting antibiotics. A
CXR was also obtained which revealed worsensing of
opacities/effusions. central venous line was removed. Pts exam
remained stable.

On [**4-3**] the urine culture was positive. A repeat U/A was obtained
for confirmation. Pt's exam stable.

On [**4-4**] The second u/a returned as positive therefore the
patient was started on Bactrim per the sensitivies of the
original culture. Her foley catheter was also changed. Speech
and swallow consultation was obtained for PEG planning. This was
discussed with the family but they were resistant to the idea of
placing one. The patient upon exam was opening eyes to minimal
stimuli, attending examiner, Left UE localizing and hemiplegic
on the right.

On [**4-5**] A family meeting was held with
