79F NH resident, MMP including CAD, CHF--EF 30%, anemia, DM,
dementia/bipolar disease, prior GIB [**12-17**] gastritis,
cholelithiasis, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 882**] on

Admit chest x-ray:
CHEST X-RAY PORTABLE AP: There is a nasogastric tube, which is
properly
positioned with tip in the stomach. A left chest wall dual lead
pacemaker is
present with leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. The
lung volumes
are low, limiting evaluation. The head shadow obscures the
superior aspect of
the lung apices. No parenchymal opacities are present.

IMPRESSION:

Nasogastric tube properly positioned with tip in the stomach.

..
CT abdomen:
INDICATIONS: Status post cholecystectomy tube placement. Tube is
not
completely in the gallbladder.

CT GUIDED CHOLECYSTOSTOMY TUBE REVISION:


CT GUIDED LOCALIZATION:Using informed consent from ultrasound,
the gallbladder
was localized with CT Fluoroscopy. In the usual sterile manner,
Xylocaine was
infiltrated with local anesthesia.


CT GUIDED GALL BLADDER DRAINAGE:Under CT guidance, an 8 French
pigtail
catheter was inserted into the gallbladder. Approximately 10 cc
of purulent
material was returned. The patient tolerated the procedure well
without
immediate complications.

Post procedure CT demonstrates the cholecystostomy tube to be in
the proper
place.

The staff radiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6632**], was present for the entire
procedure.

IMPRESSION: Successful revision of 8 French cholecystostomy
tube.
..
RUQ U/S:
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND. Comparison is made to
ultrasound of [**2120-9-28**]
and CT of [**2120-9-29**].

FINDINGS:

There is a large stone and sludge seen within the gallbladder.
The size of
the stone is difficult to measure, but is roughly 1.8 cm. In
addition, there
is circumferential gallbladder wall edema and apparent
thickening of the wall
up to 12 mm. The gallbladder itself does not appear distended.
The common
bile duct is not dilated and measures 4 mm. No intrahepatic
ductal dilation
is seen. No free fluid is seen in the right upper quadrant.

The right kidney measures 10.8 cm. The left kidney measures 9.6
cm. There is
no hydronephrosis in either kidney. No stones are identified in
either
kidney.

The liver itself appears slightly increased in echogenicity
consistent with
fatty infiltration. No obvious liver masses are seen.

IMPRESSION:

Sludge and stone within the gallbladder with apparent
gallbladder wall edema
up to 12 mm. The gallbladder is not distended and there is no
biliary
dilation. These findings are similar to those on the prior
ultrasound. These
findings are concerning for cholecystitis. No hydronephrosis.
These findings
were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at the time of interpretation.
..
Abdominal U/S [**12-6**]:
INDICATIONS: A 79-year-old woman with cholangitis, status post
stent
placement, bilirubin not decreasing. Concern for a good stent.
Evaluate for
biliary duct dilation.

FINDINGS:

This study was extremely limited due to body habitus. There is
mild
intrahepatic biliary dilatation. A common bile duct is normal in
size
measuring approximately 5 mm in diameter. The biliary stent was
not well
visualized. The gall bladder is mildly distended and contends
extensive
sludge. There is marked gallbladder wall edema although this
seems slightly
decreased compared to prior ultrasound on [**2121-12-2**]. Evaluation
of the liver
is extremely limited. The visualized portions of neck and body
of the
pancreas were unremarkable. The head and tail of the pancreas
were not
visualized. There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
Doppler images
demonstrate a patent portal vein with hepatopetal flow. A color
Doppler images
of the gallbladder show no increased flow in the gallbladder
wall.


IMPRESSION:

Very limited study due to body habitus; persistent mild
intrahepatic biliary
dilatation. There is gallbladder wall edema with significant
amount of sludge
in the gallbladder lumen. Clinic correlation is recommended. The
biliary
stent was not visualized.
...
Repeat U/S [**12-8**]:
INDICATION: 79-year-old woman with cholangitis with persistent
elevated
bilirubin. Assess for ductal dilatation.

COMPARISON: Multiple previous ultrasounds.

FINDINGS: Again, the exam is limited by patient body habitus. No

intrahepatic ductal dilatation is seen. The common duct measures
5 mm. The
portal vein is open, and flow is hepatopetal. The gallbladder is
filled with
stones.

IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis. No biliary dilatation.
...
ERCP on [**12-3**]:
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was placed in the prone
position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and
advanced under direct visualization until the second part of the
duodenum was reached. Careful visualization was performed. The
procedure was not difficult. The quality of the preparation was
good. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
complications.
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: A single diverticulum with large opening was
found on the rim of the major papilla.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts
was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand
technique. Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification. The procedure was highly difficult. Following
cannulation frank purulent discharge noted
