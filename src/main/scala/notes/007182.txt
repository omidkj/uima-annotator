History of Present Illness:
86M male with h/o of SCC of the tongue and mid-esophagus s/p
hemiglossectomy and modified lateral neck resection now getting
post-OP RT who presents with diarrhea, inability to take PO, and
shortness of breath. He initially presented to radiation for
treatment [**10-3**] today. He was noted to be orthostatic and
tachycardic with O2 sats in the 80s-90s and sent to the ED. The
patient reports diarrhea which started the night priot to
admission.

received 2500 cc IVF total. CXR showed multifocal PNA. ECG
showed lateral ST depression in V5/V6 and AVL and he was given
aspirin and started on a heparin gtt at 700 units/hr. Guaiac
negative. Lactate 3.8, unchanged after 3L IVF. CTA showed no PE.
He was given CTX and Azithro for CAP. T max: 103. Vitals prior

Brief Hospital Course:
86yo M w/hx of SCC s/p XRT who presents with shortness of
breath, hypoxia and multifocal PNA.

# Multifocal pneumonia: Pt started on vancomycin, unasyn, and
levofloxacin to cover CAP v. aspiration pneumonia in an
immunocompromised patient. Unable to obtain sputum for culture;
urine legionella Ag neg. PCP considered due to prednisone use
since [**10/2144**] but distribution of infiltrates on imaging not
consistent. Pt was initially maintained on face mask overnight
but weaned easily to NC, satting 92% on 4L on transfer to the
floor.On the floor had episodes of desaturation to 80's. Repeat
cxr showed development of pleural effusions,rt>lt and worsening
of consolidation.Unasyn was switched to zosyn and pt also
underwent a diagnostic and therapeutic rt sided thoracentesis. 1
lit of fluid was drained which was c/w a non-complicated
parapneumonitic effusion. Speech & swallow consulted to evaluate
aspiration risk he also underwent a video assisted swallow
study. S&S services recommended a a diet of thin liquids and
ground solids.
On d/c pt started on bactrim prophylaxis as he is continued on
prednisone 30 mg daily for PMR.
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Attributed to multifocal PNA as
above as well as volume overload which developed after INF
hydration for hypotension. No PE seen on CTA chest. Initial
concern for ACS leading to acute CHF (see below) but ruled out;
echo showing normal EF. Hypoxia improved with treatment of
pneumonia, thoracentesis and diureses.On d/c pt'd O2 sat 99 on 3
lit per NC.Pt also likely has COPD and was treated with nebs and
started on advair.

#. Shock: Likely combination of septic and hypotensive shock. Pt
treated for pneumonia as above; cultures were all negative.He
was also fluid-resuscitated and weaned off low-dose
norepinephrine. Stress dose steroids were not needed. As above,
no evidence of cardiogenic shock. However, other etiologies
include cardiogenic in setting of NSTEMI. Also, hypovolemic from
diarrhea.  Right IJ pulled prior to floor transfer.On th efloor
blood remained stable.

#. NSTEMI: ECG with lateral ST depressions and mild ST elevation
in v1/v2. Pt started on ASA and heparin gtt. However, Cards
fellow felt this was more consistent with early repolarization
from LVH. EKG normalized in AM and cardiac enzymes neg x 2. Echo
with no wall motion abnormality and normal EF.  Heparin gtt
discontinued but aspirin continued.

# New onset atrial fibrillation: Did not aggresively rate
control for HR in low 100??????s initially given underlying
hypotension. No evidence of PE on CTA. Left atrium markedly
dilated and right atrium moderately dilated on TTE. Thoug
