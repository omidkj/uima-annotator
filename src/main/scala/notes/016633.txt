Imaging:
RUQ ultrasound ([**1-1**]):
LIVER AND GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND: The liver appears heterogenous
in echotexture with a nodular contour. No definite focal hepatic
lesion is seen. The gallbladder wall appears mildly thickened,
likely due to underlying liver disease. No gallstones are noted.
The common bile duct is normal in caliber, measuring 0.5 cm, and
there is no evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The
main portal vein is patent but shows reversed hepatofugal flow.
The spleen measures 13 cm which is mildly enlarged. The
visualized portions of the pancreas are unremarkable. There is
moderate to large amount of ascites, particularly in the right
lower quadrant.
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis with hepatofugal flow within the main portal vein.
Moderate to large amount of ascites and mild splenomegaly.
2. Mild gallbladder wall thickening that is likely due to
underlying liver disease.
