History of Present Illness:
31year old woman without sig past medical history who presented
[**2155-6-24**] on transfer from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with hypotension, presumed
sepsis, ARDS, hyperbilirubinemia, now with facial palsy and
generalized weakness.

Three days prior to transfer, she had presented to OSH with
lower abdominal pain, slight F. Whe was diagnosed with UTI by
UA, given levofloxacin and discharged home. Upon arriving home,
she developed fevers to 103, n/v, and diarrhea. She did not take
the Abx. She returned to the ED two days later with worsening
symptoms. RUQ u/s showed gallbladder wall thickening, but no
cholecystitis. CT abd/pelvis at that time was normal. Patient
became hypotensive to 70s and experienced respiratory failure
with hypoxia (O2 desat to 80s). She was intubated and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

EMG Study Date of [**2155-7-15**]
Abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence for severe,
subacute bilateral facial neuropathies characterized by
prominent axonal loss; the right side is slightly worse than the
left. There is no evidence for a generalized polyneuropathy or
polyradiculopathy to explain this patient's appendicular
weakness (as would be seen in Guillain-[**Location (un) **] Syndrome). In
addition, there is no definite evidence for a myopathic process
to explain this weakness, although subtle myopathies may be
difficult to identify on electrophysiologic study. Studies of
neuromuscular transmission were not performed during this
evaluation.

Given the absence of a clear peripheral etiology for the
patient's appendicular weakness, a central cause should be
considered.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2155-7-12**] 12:16 PM
Normal [**Month/Day/Year 4338**] of the brain with and without gadolinium.

Brief Hospital Course:
31F with presumed sepsis due to pneumonia vs. urinary tract
infection vs. IUD though all cultures negative developed ARDS
requiring intubation.

1. Infection/sepis: At [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], patient presented with
fever/nausea/vomiting and had bibasilar infiltrates, abdominal
pain and increased liver enzymes with bilirubin of 5.0.  CT
showed pericholic fluid and ?hydrosalpinx with IUD in place but
was normotensive.  On transfer, patient was intubated,
hypotensive, on neosynephrine.  Patient initially require blood
pressure support with three pressors.  However, patient was
successfully fluid resuscitated to good blood pressure, pressors
stopped and changed to levophed. Chest XRay consistent with
ARDS.  ERCP negative. Transvaginal ultrasound showed no
hydrosalpinx, no tubovarian abscess, and some mild ovarian
cysts, none dominant; there was free flowing fluid in the
peritoneum and in [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch that did not appear purulent
or bloody.

Of note, echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 30% of
unclear etiology, although it was postulated due to postpartum
cardiomyopathy.  Per ID consultants, clinical picture may be
consistent toxic shock syndrome, although toxin negative and no
erythroderma.  Clindamycin (d/c??????d [**6-29**]) was started for protein
synthesis inhibition of toxin and Gr- covg, and oxacillin (d/c??????d
[**6-29**]) for Gr+ coverage switched to vancomycin and
piperacillin/tazo for better nosocomial coverage. Levofloxacin
for legionella, atypical coverage.  Flagyl for anaerobic and
Clostridium difficile coverage in setting of diarrhea following
antibiotics. IUD removed.

As patient's hemodynamics improved, cultures continued to remain
negative, and patient's clinical picture stabilized.  Patient
was weaned off pressors, and antibiotics were removed.  Patient
was transferred to the floor.

Total microbiological workup revealed negative for:
RPR, C diff, AFB, fungus, yeast, legionella, HIV, ASO, Stool
studies negative for O/P, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 57976**], RSV, cryptococcal
antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, Hepatitis C Serology, Hantavirus,
Aspergillus, HbS, anti-HepBS, anti-HepBc, [**Last Name (un) **], [**Last Name (un) **] IgM, Lyme,
Babesiosis.

2. ARDS/hypoxia:
Patient was ventilated with low tidal volumes to prevent volume
trauma.  Patient underwent broncheoalveolar lavage as well as
thoracenteses which were both unrevealing, except for transudate
in pleural fluid, which was otherwise negative for evidence of a
source.

ARDS gradually resolved, and patient was extubated without
complications o
