CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Malaise, nausea and vomiting.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 34331**] is a 60-year-old
woman with a prior medical history of end stage renal disease
secondary to polycystic kidney disease on hemodialysis with
multiple graft clot and revisions secondary to non compliance
with Coumadin, also with hypertension and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, discharged from vascular surgery service
yesterday after having been unable to underlie hemodialysis
secondary to a thrombosed graft.  The patient missed several
Coumadin doses prior to the graft thrombosing.  Subsequently
she missed hemodialysis.  On [**7-8**] she had a thrombectomy and
she was discharged.  She went to have hemodialysis on [**7-10**]
but was unable to dialyze again as access was not obtained.
She was readmitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
for thrombectomy which was performed on [**2115-7-10**] and is now
being transferred to medicine for complaint of malaise,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  The patient is a poor historian
but he reports 2-3 weeks of intermittent vomiting and nausea
with subsequent decreased po intake, including her
medications.  She denies any abdominal pain, fever, chills,
hematemesis, coffee ground or change in symptoms with food.
She complains of diarrhea of loose brown stool, no melena, no
blood or mucus.  Stools are not clearly related to eating and
she can have [**5-31**] bowel movements per day which vary in size.
No recent history of travel, no sick contacts at home, no
weight loss.  The patient also complains of chronic cough
which has been increased recently.  She denies any shortness
of breath, chest pain, changes in sputum color or hemoptysis.
She uses inhalers more than usual but denies any wheezes or
other upper respiratory infection symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end stage renal
disease on hemodialysis secondary to polycystic kidney
disease with multiple clotted graft followed by revision.
Hypertension, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin per patient report.

MEDICATIONS:  RenaGel 800 mg tid, Nephrocaps one q d,
Albuterol as needed, Atrovent as needed, Coumadin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband and daughter.  She
has a positive tobacco history which consisted of two packs
per day for 30 years.  She quit one year ago, denies any
alcohol use and reports that her family helps her with her
medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.4, heart rate 92, blood
pressure 115/50, respiratory rate 16 with an oxygen
saturation of 98% on room air.  General appearance, sleeping
but arousable, in no acute distress with occasional
congestive cough.  HEENT:  Anicteric, pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light, oropharynx clear.  Neck supple
without JVD.  Chest, positive mild inspiratory plus
expiratory wheezes with decreased air movement throughout, no
rales.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended with positive
bowel sounds, no right upper quadrant tenderness to
palpation, no mass.  Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema, Pneumo boots on.  Neuro, alert and oriented times
three, cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Strength
extremities not tested secondary to surgery today [**4-26**], left
upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities.  Babinski
downgoing.

LABORATORY DATA:  WBC 8.8, hematocrit 34.4, platelet count
184,000, PT 13, PTT 27, INR 1.2, sodium 136, potassium 5.2,
chloride 95, CO2 24, BUN 58, creatinine 9.2, glucose 82.
Albumin 3.7, ALT 11, AST 15, alkaline phosphatase 117, total
bilirubin 0.5, amylase 61, lipase 47.  EKG on [**7-10**], sinus
tachycardia at 105, no acute ST or T wave changes.  C. diff
negative.  Radiology data: KUB, nonspecific bowel gas
pattern, no dilated loops.  Chest x-ray, hyperinflated lungs,
no evidence of pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
Urinalysis on [**10-6**] cloudy, large blood, positive nitrites and
leukoesterase, 100 protein, PH 9.0, more than 50 RBC and WBC
and many bacteria.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 34331**] is a 60-year-old woman with end
stage renal disease secondary to polycystic kidney disease on
hemodialysis and also with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, presenting with a few weeks of intermittent nausea
and vomiting, diarrhea and decreased po intake.

GI:  Etiology of nausea and vomiting and diarrhea is unclear;
could be related to renal function as the patient has missed
dialysis sessions during the past weeks and her BUN and
creatinine have been elevated.  During her hospital course
she also related that the nausea, vomiting and diarrhea had
been occurring the past when she missed hemodialysis or her
BUN and creatinine were particularly elevated.  The nausea
and vomiting resolved throughout her hospital stay right
after she underwent dialysis but continued to appear in a
milder form in between dialysis sessions.

Renal failure:  The patient requires hemodialysis.  The
patient presented to medicine status post AV graft
thrombectomy with primary graft repair.  Not withstanding the
thrombectomy and despite the heparin drip, the graft remained
non palpable but positive to Doppler.  Heparin was increased
to achieve a PTT between 60 and 90 and Coumadin was started.
A Perma-cath was placed on [**2115-7-11**] to be used for dialysis
until the graft would be cleared by vascular surgery.  The
patient received dialysis through the Perma-cath on [**2115-7-12**].
Meanwhile, the rate of the heparin drip had to be increased
as the patient had difficulty in achieving PTT therapeutic
range of 60-90.  An arteriographic exploration of the graft
was planned while the patient remained on heparin and
Coumadin was titrated to achieve the therapeutic INR between
2.5 and 3.5.  As arteriography could not be easily scheduled
during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, the procedure was
scheduled as an outpatient for one week later.  The patient
continued to remain in hospital until [**2115-7-17**] in the attempt
to achieve a therapeutic INR so that she could be discharged
on Coumadin only.  However, as this did not happen by [**7-17**]
and the patient was eager to go home, she was discharged on
Lovenox.  Teaching was performed by a teaching nurse and her
daughter appeared to be able to inject the patient with
Lovenox.  She was instructed to have her daughter inject her
with Lovenox and have her INR checked at the local clinic
where she had been going before.  She would be returning to
the hospital for an outpatient revision of the graft.
