Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy ([**2114-8-7**])

History of Present Illness:
28yo F w/ [**Year (4 digits) **] Syndrome (diabetes insipidus, diabetes
mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness) and a history of multiple
pneumonias, here w/ cough and congestion. Started with a head
cold mid-week last week. Over the weekend she had a worsening
cough productive of greenish sputum and chills. No nausea,
vomiting or diarrhea. She felt more dyspneic than usual. She
came in with her mother to a pre-planned pulmonary appointment,
and her mother thought she looked sick and would likely need to
come into clinic. In clinic, her ABG was 7.42/47/63/32 and she
was referred to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.2 P 119 BP 132/74 R 20 O2 sat
95%. Patient was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs, levofloxacin
and 1L NS. HR in 120s, up to 140s with exertion, so she was
triaged to the MICU. D-dimer negative. Vitals prior to transfer
were 98.7, 108, 105/56, 22.
.
On the floor, she says that her cough is now mainly bringing up
white sputum. She reports severe hyperglycemia (monitor
unreadable) and thirst over the last few days. Her appetite has
been normal. No N/V, D/C, dysuria, rash, arthralgias, chest
pain, sore throat or abdominal pain. All other ROS negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
28yo female w/ [**Month/Day/Year **]'s syndrome, repeated pneumonia, and h/o
hypercarbic respiratory failure, and DM here w/ worsening cough
and dyspnea.

Active Diagnoses:

# Dyspnea: Patient's clinical presentation, exam, and imaging
most consistent with viral respiratory infection/pneumonia or
atypical pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU from the ED and
was placed on nebs and levofloxacin and maintained adequate
oxygen saturations. Patient's dyspnea improved and she was able
to be transferred to the floor. Sputum culture was positive for
GPC in pairs and clusters. She was started emperically on
vancomycin. When she became more somnolent on her current
regimen and repeat CXR showed multifocal pna, her antibiotics
were expanded to vanc/levo/cefepime and she was given chest PT
to help clear her secretions. Her final sputum culture results
demonstrated commensal respiratory flora yet given this
patient's history of severe pneumonias she was maintained on
broad antibiotic coverage as above. She continued to recieved
chest PT, nebs then inhalers, expectorants but had difficulty
being weened down from 3-4L (at which she satted in the mid to
high 90's) O2 by nasal cannula during the day. Repeat CXR was
unchanged from prior study and the pulmonary team was consulted
and recommended non-con CT chest to evaluate need for
bronchoscopy. CT demonstrated near-complete consolidation in her
right middle lobe and a portion of the left lower lobe with
secretions in the airways and she received bronchoscopy to clear
airway secretions the following day ([**8-7**]). Following
bronchoscopy she was satting in the high 80's on non-rebreather
and was transferred to the MICU overnight primarily for
monitoring purposes. She became febrile to 102F and developed a
white count which soon resolved. Her oxygen requirements fell
without further episodes of hypoxia and she was transferred back
to the floor. Her condition continued to improve and her
antibiotics were d/c'd after a 10 day course. Her O2 was weaned
and she was able to sat in the mid-high 90's on room air both at
rest and when ambulating.
