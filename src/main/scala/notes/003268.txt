History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old woman with h/o NHL (27 years ago),
complicated by lung toxicity [**1-25**] to Bleomycin treatment,
sarcoidosis, Factor V Leiden, systolic CHF (EF 30%, adriamycin
toxicity), CKD, recently discharged to rehab after a complicated
hospital course for respiratory distress, requiring trach and
PEG placement, s/p treatment for PNA, currently being treated
for Cdiff colitis, now presents with fever.

Patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 107084**] for respiratory
failure, requiring intubation. The patient was unable to be
weaned from the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] trach and PEG were placed. During this
hospitalization, the patient was persistently febrile, despite
treatment with Abx. She was treated for an 9d course of
Vanc/Cefepime for presumed HAP. Given an Abx holiday for 48-72
hrs given concern for drug fevers, but fevers persisted. She was
restarted on Vanc/Cefepime with addition of IV Flagyl and PO
Vanc for positive Cdiff. Prior to d/c, sputum culture grew gram
negative rods, so IV Vanc was d/c'd and Cefepime was changed to
Meropenem. Meropenem was continued until [**2163-9-29**] at rehab. The
patient is currently still on PO Vanc and PO Flagyl for Cdiff
treatment.

The patient was noted to have low grade fevers for the past week
at rehab. She was restarted on Vanc and Meropenem. Temp was up
to 102.6 today, so she was transferred to the ED for further
care. The patient currently feels well. She notes some R wrist
pain/tendinitis. There have been no changes in her [**Month/Day/Year **]
settings. She is currently on Flagyl and PO Vanc for Cdiff
colitis. She continues to have loose stools, although improved
from when she intially went to rehab. No chills, sweats,
increased cough, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 102.2 P 119 BP 143/83 RR 43 O2 sat
100% [**Month/Day/Year **]. The patient was tachycardic to 110, but BP remained
stable. CXR unchanged from prior. UA unremarkable. Patient was
given Tylenol, Vancomycin, and Meropenem. Vitals on transfer: P
97 BP 108/54 RR 30 O2sat 100% [**Month/Day/Year **].

On the floor, the patient remains comfortable. She notes R wrist
pain, but otherwise has no complaints.

IMAGING:
[**10-5**] CXR:
Low lung volumes and overall stable interstitial opacities.
Given differences in technique and patient position, left
pleural effusion is likely without significant change.

[**10-12**] CXR:
In comparison with the study of [**10-10**], there is still diffuse
bilateral pulmonary opacifications bilaterally in a patient with
known sarcoidosis. No definite evidence of acute focal
pneumonia. Tracheostomy device remains in place.

[**10-10**] Upper Extremity Doppler:
Deep venous thrombosis involving the right subclavian and
axillary veins, with extension into one of two brachial veins.
The internal jugular, basilic and cephalic veins remain patent.

[**10-6**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process.
2. Redemonstration of interstitial and peribronchial thickening
consistent
with the patient's history of sarcoidosis with new areas of
ground-glass
opacity within the medial lower lobes bilaterally. While this
could be related to sarcoidosis, superimposed infection or
aspiration cannot be excluded and clinical correlation is
recommended
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions
4. Hyperenhancing 1.8 mm region within segment VIII of the liver
peripherally, which likely represents a benign perfusion
abnormality.
5. Hypodensities within the kidneys bilaterally, which are
incompletely
characterized, but likely represent renal cysts, some of which
were present on the prior non-contrast study.
