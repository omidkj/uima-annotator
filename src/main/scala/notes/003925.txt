Admission Date:  [**2180-5-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-5-22**]


Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred for anterior myocardial
infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known firstname 47987**] is an 82-year-old
woman who presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital on the morning of
admission with chest pain.  She said the chest pain began
approximately 12 hours earlier, was substernal, and somewhere
the anginal chest pain that she has been experiencing the
past few days to weeks.  The pain was different in that it
occurred.  Pain was different the evening the prior to
admission, it was nonexertional and did not subside.

Electrocardiograms at [**Hospital3 1280**] demonstrated ST elevations
in V2 through V6, and T-wave inversions.  She also has Q
waves in II, III, and F, which likely represent old ischemia.
The patient received IV nitrogen, Heparin, Plavix, and
Integrilin, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for catheterization.  Catheterization
demonstrated discrete left anterior descending artery total
occlusion.  She had a Cypher stent placed with subsequent
TIMI-III flow.  Her hemodynamics were consistent with
cardiogenic shock with pulmonary capillary wedge of 34,
cardiac output of 3.32 and cardiac index of 2.02.  Subsequent
flow in her artery was evaluated at TIMI-II.  Intra-aortic
balloon pump was placed.  The patient was transferred to the
CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. Hypothyroidism.
5. Status post left hip fracture and open reduction internal
fixation.  Right hip with congenital deformity.
6. Osteoarthritis.
7. Hiatal hernia, large retrocardiac.
8. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
9. Depression.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 40 po q day.
2. Atenolol 25 po bid.

9. Trazodone 25 mg po prn.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives in Catholic Convent since the age of
23.  No tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.0, pulse 91-101,
blood pressure 91/59, augmented diastolic 123, assisted
systolic 106, respiratory rate 18, and O2 saturation 97%.
P.A. pressure 31/21 with a mean of 25.  General:  Pleasant,
awake, elderly woman in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Moist mucous membranes.  Neck supple,
obese.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no
murmur.  Pulmonary:  Crackles on the left dependent side to
50%, and at the right base.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities warm, no edema, 1+ DPP
bilaterally.  Neurologic is alert, oriented, and appropriate.

LABORATORIES:  White count 12.5, hematocrit 37.2, platelets
303.  Sodium 136, potassium 3.3, chloride 101, bicarb 24, BUN
13, creatinine 0.5, glucose 118, calcium 8.5, magnesium 1.8,
phosphorus 4.0, albumin 3.3.  CK peak of 3.925, decreased to
207 on [**5-20**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Sister [**Name (NI) 47987**] was admitted to the Cardiac
Care Unit for further management poststent given her
cardiogenic shock.

Hemodynamics:  The patient was maintained on the intra-aortic
balloon pump for 48 hours.  Fluid was initially maintained as
even.  She subsequently underwent diuresis with her goal dry
weight approximately 78 kg.  Echocardiogram demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 25-30%, moderately dilated left atrium,
mildly dilated right atrium, severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinetic with anterior to mid
anterior septal, anterior apex, septal apex, lateral apex,
which is dyskinetic.

Physiologic mitral regurgitation 1+ tricuspid regurgitation,
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  On
echocardiogram on [**2180-5-17**], there was a small to moderate
sized pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade.
Patient was initially maintained on anticoagulation for
intra-aortic balloon pump with plans to transition her to
long-term anticoagulation given her areas of akinesis and low
ejection fraction.  However, given findings of pericardial
effusion, which was suggestive of possible hemorrhagic
effusion.  Anticoagulation was stopped.  Patient underwent
repeat echocardiogram on [**5-19**], which demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 30-35%, and a small pericardial effusion
without signs of tamponade.  Decision was made that to
indefinitely hold further anticoagulation with Coumadin.

Ischemia:  Patient was maintained on aspirin and Plavix x9
months for stent placement.  She was started on a beta
blocker, titrated to 75 mg po bid as well as an ACE
inhibitor, lisinopril 5 mg po q day.

Rhythm:  Patient experienced transient right bundle branch
block with left anterior fascicular block the first day
postprocedure.  She underwent placement of transvenous pacing
wires on [**2180-5-16**].  She experienced no further block on
[**2180-5-17**], and wires were removed on [**2180-5-18**].  Patient had
some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on the first 48
hours post myocardial infarction.  She underwent evaluation
by Electrophysiology staff, who recommended further
evaluation with signal averaging studies.  These are to be
performed on [**2180-5-22**].  Results should be reviewed at her
next cardiologist.   The patient is also referred to Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41364**] for further followup of her
Electrophysiology issues.

2. Endocrine:  The patient was continued on her outpatient
Synthroid dose.  The TFTs are within normal limits.

3. Heme:  The patient underwent oozing from her groin line
sites requiring blood transfusions.  Her hematocrit remained
stable, 33-34 in the days prior to discharge.

4. Neurological:  Patient developed agitation and altered
mental status on her second and third days of admission.  Per
patient's companions at the convent, this is her baseline and
responded very well to treatment with Haldol.  The patient
with known baseline mental disorder and was maintained on her
trazodone and Celexa in-house.

5. Diet:  The patient will need to follow a low salt
heart-healthy diet, less than 2 grams of sodium per day.
Follow up arranged with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1075**] [**6-8**] at 11:45 am.

DISPOSITION:  Extended care facility.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  The patient will need Physical Therapy,
monitoring of electrolytes every 2-3 days, and possible
adjustment of her Lasix dose.  She will need LFTs in six
weeks, she was started on a statin drug, and follow up on her
Electrophysiology studies done on the day of discharge.

1. Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q day.
