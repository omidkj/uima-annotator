History of Present Illness:
49F with h/o CAD s/p 5v CABG, DM2, and HTN, admitted with L leg
erythema, fever, and now with [**Last Name (un) **]. Pt initially awoke on Wed [**2-25**]
with fevers to 102.5 and shaking chills, along with multiple
episodes of nausea and nonbilious, nonbloody emesis.
Significantly decreased po intake over the next 3-4 days as
well. On Thurs [**2-26**], pt subsequently developed L foot swelling,
erythema, and pain, along with a large blister on the medial
aspect of her L foot. Over the course of three days, she took 3
tabs of ibuprofen tid, unsure of dose. She denied orthostatic
sx. Pt presented to the ED on Friday morning [**2207-2-27**]-- at that
time, was febrile to 102.1 with rigors (was given ibuprofen and
tylenol). She was started on zosyn/vancomycin for cellulitis and
admitted to medicine. Creat at that time was 1.6. Since then,
BCx have grown out coag + staph in [**3-29**] bottles.
.
After admission, pt progressively became more hypotensive, with
diminishing urine output over the day yesterday. Was given 6L
0.9NS on the floor, with BPs remaining in mid-80s systolic. She
also developed new onset RUE weakness; MRI was negative for
acute stroke. She was transferred to MICU last night, where she
has remained febrile and hypotensive, and was started on
dopamine. Pt currently being followed by podiatry and vascular
surgery, who feel that this is acute charcot foot with overlying
soft tissue infection.
.
Currently, pt c/o nausea and continued dry heaves. Denies
dyspnea, orthostatic sx, or chest pain. Says she has been told
about mild CKD in the past, but is unsure about her baseline
creatinine. She has never been told about proteinuria in the
past, and denies regular NSAID use (aside from acute use in past
few days).


Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  [**Known firstname **] has got a number of medical
problems stemming from hypertension and diabetes.  She has had

IMAGING:

3/5 L foot x-ray:
1. Findings concerning for possible osteomyelitis superimposed
on an evolving Charcot's joint, although no radiographic
evidence of ulcer. Extensive osseous destruction and lucencies
involving the medial and mid cuneiforms, second and third
metatarsal bases, and navicular bone. While findings could in
part relate to an evolving Charcot's joint, new since [**3-/2205**],
they are in conjunction with overlying soft tissue gas and
swelling, making superimposed osteomyelitis of concern.
Recommend clinical correlation for soft tissue
defect/ulcer and further evaluation with nuclear medicine study
or MRI.
2. Gas noted in anterior ankle. Given known leg cellulitis,
proximal extent not evaluated.

[**2-28**] MRI/MRA Head: No signs of infarct.

[**3-1**] CXR:
Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2207-2-27**]. The heart
is enlarged. There is atelectasis at the left lung base with a
small left pleural effusion. This is status post median
sternotomy. Right lung is relatively clear.

[**3-1**] Renal ultrasound: No evidence of hydronephrosis.

[**3-2**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is s
