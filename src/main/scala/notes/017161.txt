Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
Groin Pain, Abdominal Pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis (multiple)


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 year old male with a history of alcoholic
cirrhosis who presents with 8-10 days of stomach pain and
right-sided groin pain.  He went to his PCP for this and was
sent home with hot packs.  This pain got so bad that he decided
to stop his diuretics because it was too painful for him to get
to the bathroom.  A few day PTA, patient was referred to surgery
for suspicion of a right inguinal hernia, but was not felt to be
a good surgical candidate.  He was sent home with codeine for
pain control.  Patient also reports 3-4 episodes of
fevers/chills and nausea/vomiting as far back as 1 month ago,
Tmax 103.  The pain worsened, and he reported to the ED.
.
Subsequent ED and ICU course is as follows: Initial CT w/
contrast showed a fluid-filled inguinal hernia but no bowel
inside as well as a crescent-shaped area of oral contrast
extravasation in the duodenum, with possible perforated DU.  CXR
showed bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  He
was also tapped on day of admission, with WBC 2875 (87% PMNs),
RBC 1750.  No abx were given at this point.  His suspected
perforated DU was medically managed at this point due to liver
failure.  He was started on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], NGT and pressors x 1 day
while receiving fluids for treatment of sepsis.  His BP resolved
to consistent low 100's.  He received another tap on [**9-17**] (WBCs
1825, 92% PMNs).  Started on Cefepime (day 1 = [**9-17**]) to treat SBP
and was kept NPO x 3-4 days while in the unit.  Received
bicarbonate due to a creatinine bump from IV contrast for repeat
CT, which did not show any bowel perforation.  It did show
continued cirrhosis, ascites, and bilateral pleural effusions.
.
He was tapped on [**9-17**] for 3 liters, mildly improved with less
PMNs.  Received 24g albumin, then received 100g on [**9-19**], and 50g
today.  Started on 150 octreotide/10 midodrine on [**9-18**] for
suspicion HRS, despite being on Lasix 40 IV up until transfer
(aldactone has been held).
.
On transfer to floor, patient is hemodynamically stable,
comfortably sitting in chair.
.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**9-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small curvilinear hyperdense material seen in the
retroperitoneum just posterior and superior to the second
portion of the duodenum, likely represents extraluminal
contrast. This raises concern for duodenal perforation.
Evaluation of the duodenum is limited as it is poorly distended
with oral contrast.
2. Bilateral large pleural effusions with compressive
atelectasis of the lower lobes.
3. Large amount of simple ascites.
4. Nodular hepatic contour, in keeping with the patient's known
history of cirrhosis.
.
.
CT Abd/pelvis ([**9-17**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis, ascites, and large bilateral pleural effusions are
unchanged.
2. Resulting compressive atelectasis causes right lower lobe and
near total left lower lobe collapse.
3. No evidence of bowel perforation.

COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison.
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of left subclavian,
left axillary, and brachial veins were performed. There is
normal compressibility, flow and augmentation in the above
veins. The left internal jugular vein demonstrates normal
compressibility. The basilic vein is normal. There is
thrombophlebitis involving the left cephalic vein. Evidence of
thrombus is seen in the cephalic vein with surrounding
subcutaneous edema.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.
Thrombophlebitis of the left cephalic vein.
