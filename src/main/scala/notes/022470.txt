                    ADDENDUM

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an addendum to the hospital course
beginning [**2163-7-12**].

1.  Vascular:  The patient had planned to be discharged back
to rehabilitation without any intervention given that she had
no cardiac symptoms during this hospitalization and her
troponin had trended down; however, on [**2163-7-12**], the
patient developed the sudden onset of chest pressure.  The
patient noted some response of her symptoms with the
application of sublingual Nitroglycerin.  Electrocardiogram
was notable for some anterior ST elevations.  She was
subsequently started on Heparin and Integrilin.  Plavix had
also been added to her regimen.  The patient had no
elevations in her CKs but did have another elevation in her
troponin to 5.9.  The patient had previously refused cardiac
catheterization during this hospitalization and continued to
do so now in the setting of new evidence of an non-ST
elevation myocardial infarction.  This episode was not
accompanied by atrial fibrillation as her prior episode at
the outside hospital.

Over the next day or two, the patient was noted to have a
fall in her hematocrit and melenic stools thought to be
secondary to GI bleed.  The patient was transfused and
ultimately consented to cardiac catheterization.

Of note echocardiogram on [**2163-7-12**], had noted an ejection
fraction of 35-40%, mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, moderate aortic stenosis, impaired left
ventricular relaxation, and mild pulmonary systolic
hypertension.

Cardiac catheterization was ultimately performed on [**2163-7-15**], and revealed multi-vessel disease including stenoses of
her native vessels with two patent grafts; however, a
significant thrombus was noted proximally in the saphenous
vein graft to left anterior descending graft.  Given the
heavy thrombus burden, a direct intervention of either
angioplasty or stenting was deferred secondary to recent GI
bleeding.  As a result, there was no direct intervention
during this cardiac catheterization.

Postcatheterization the patient's hematocrit remained stable.
Over the final several days of her hospital stay, her cardiac
regimen was maximized.  She was started back on her Lasix two
days prior to discharge at less than her prior dose.  She
appeared relatively euvolemic at the time of discharge.  The
patient had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation and
was in normal sinus rhythm throughout her hospital stay.  She
was maintained on low-dose Lopressor for rate control.  The
decision was made not to anticoagulate given her GI bleeding
risk.

The patient was noted to be borderline bradycardiac at times
during her hospital stay.  She was taken off of her Norvasc
and continued on low-dose Lopressor.  The patient was
asymptomatic for her borderline bradycardia.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was with no evidence of active
congestive heart failure during this hospitalization.  As
noted, she was started back on Lasix prior to discharge, and
her ACE inhibitor was maximized.

3.  Hematologic:  The patient is with a history of GI bleed
secondary to diverticulosis.  The patient was noted to have
melanic stools in the setting of Heparin and Integrilin
during her non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.  The
patient's GI blood loss required transfusion.  After
discontinuation of antiplatelet agents, the patient's
hematocrit remained stable throughout the remainder of her
hospital stay, although her stools remained guaiac positive.

4.  GI:  The patient was with GI bleed as noted above.
Serial hematocrits were checked, and the patient's hematocrit
was stable at 32.2 at the time of discharge.  Hematocrit
should be followed at rehabilitation as an outpatient and
transfuse to keep greater than 30.

5.  Renal:  The patient presented with elevated creatinine in
the setting of her initial non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction likely secondary to hypoperfusion secondary to
atrial fibrillation and ischemia.  The patient's creatinine
gradually trended back to baseline.  She was started back on
her Lasix at the time of discharge.

6.  Infectious disease:  The patient was treated with seven
days of Bactrim for a urinary tract infection, positive for
proteus.

7.  Podiatry:  The patient was noted to have a superficial
ulceration between the web spaced of her left foot.  She was
seen by the Podiatry Service while in-house, and they
recommended daily application Betadine and dressing changes,
as well as positioning of sterile 4 x 4 gauze pads between
her web spaces q.d.  The patient will have outpatient
follow-up with her podiatrist and primary care physician.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleed and post
cardiac catheterization.
6.  Gastrointestinal bleed.
7.  Urinary tract infection.
8.  Superficial left foot ulcer.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., Zestril 40
mg p.o. q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., sublingual
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg p.r.n. chest pain, Lopressor 12.5 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Senna 1 tab p.o. q.d., Bisacodyl 10 mg p.o./p.r.
q.d. p.r.n. constipation, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq p.o.
q.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Tylenol p.r.n., Zocor 20 mg
p.o. q.d., Iron Sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d., Quinine Sulfate
260 mg p.o. q.h.s., Os-Cal 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  1.  The patient is to receive foot
care with application of Betadine to second and third web
spaces q.d.  Toes should be separated with 2 x 2 dry sterile
dressings, and the patient should be arranged for follow-up
with her podiatrist at the time of discharge.  2.  The
patient should have her in's and out's closely monitored to
keep euvolemic.  Her Lasix dose can be adjusted as necessary.
 She was previously on 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. prior to this
hospitalization but was discharged on 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  3.
The patient's hematocrit should be checked q.o.d. for the
next several days and transfused to keep greater than 30.  4.
The patient should have follow-up arranged with her
podiatrist, as well as her primary care physician.
