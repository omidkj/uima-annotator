History of Present Illness:
Mrs [**Known lastname 4643**] is a pleasant 87F with hx of intermittent vertigo on
Meclizine, afib on coumadin, recent UTI tx'd with bactrim, now
presenting to the ED for vertigo.  Pt states that 4 days ago she
noticed hematuria, which prompted her to go to her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] which
point she was given bactrim for a UTI.  She never had dysuria or
frequency.  Today she felt vertiginous and lightheaded and
therefore presented to the ED.  Pt states that he vertigo comes
on out of the blue, is not positional or worse with changing
positions.  She states that she feels thirsty but has had normal
PO intake over the last several days.  Of note, her UA from 4 d
PTA showed leuks, blood, few bacteria, creatinine was 0.87.
Urine cx showed mixed gram positive flora.

In the ED inital vitals were 98.7 60 92/68 (b/l 120/80) 18 100%
10L Non-Rebreather, which was rapidly weaned.  Venous gas showed
7.26/48/51.  Triggered for hypotension (reportedly 50/30),
central line placed, pt given 500 ccs NS, bedside echo showed
adequate pump funx, no effusion.  CVP reportedly 22.  Labs were
notable for lactate of 5.3, creatinine 1.9, gap of 16.  She was
given zofran, levofloxacin for possible PNA, and started on a
norepi gtt for hypotension.  CXR showed central venous catheter
terminating at the cavoatrial junction, mild pulmonary vascular
congestion, l-sided pleural effusion.  Line was pulled back.
BPs improved to 100s, no O2 requirement.  VItals on transfer
were 98.7 64 17 97/67 100% on 2L NC.

On arrival to the ICU, pt is comfortable.  She states that her
breathing is slightly labored however she denies SOB, cough, CP.
 She does feel slightly nauseous and weak all over.  She does
not currently feel vertiginous, however states that it comes on
suddenly and she was recently feeling nauseous.

Imaging:
[**2177-3-1**] CXR: Persistent low lung volume. Pulmonary edema has
resolved. Pacer leads are in standard position. Right IJ
catheter tip is in the upper right atrium. There is no evident
pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are small. Bibasilar
atelectases have improved on the left.

[**2177-3-1**] TTE (Focused views): IMPRESSION: Limited transthoracic
echocardiography. Unable to assess regional wall motion
abnormalities due to limited study, but overall systolic
function of the left ventricle is probably normal. Severe
tricuspid regurgitation with failure of tricuspid leaflet
coaptation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Unable to fully assess
aortic valve.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2173-4-12**], the tricuspid regurgitation
is now severe. If clinically indicated, a complete transthoracic
examination with Doppler is recommended.

[**2177-3-4**] Portable TTE: Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2177-3-1**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is now higher.

[**2177-3-2**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) :
1. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
2. Patent portal vein. Prominent hepatic veins likely due to
vascular
congestion.
3. Possible right renal fullness seen on partial views of right
kidney. If
indicated, this could be evaluated with renal ultrasound.

Renal U/s [**2177-3-12**]: Somewhat limited study however both kidneys
are within normal limits with good cortical thickness, no
hydronephrosis or mass lesions identified.  The bladder is fully
decompressed around the Foley catheter.

[**2177-3-17**] CXR: Central venous catheter and permanent pacemaker
remain unchanged in position allowing for positional differences
of the patient. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, accompanied by
pulmonary vascular engorgement. Previously reported multifocal
pulmonary opacities have partially cleared with residual
opacities mostly in the perihilar regions. This likely reflects
improving pulmonary edema.
