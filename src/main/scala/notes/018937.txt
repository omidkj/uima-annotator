History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34698**] is a 66 year old man with PMH  notable for POEMS s/p
autoSCT [**12-15**], therapy-related MDS (no MDS therapy), recently
hospitalized for F/N and
diagnosed with recurrence of POEMS syndrome, CKD on HD
presenting with 2 day h/o worsening BUE motor fasciculations and
depressed level of consciousness.

Patient recently admitted with neutropenic fever and hypotension
initially requiring intubation. Work-up notable for B+glucan and
regimen tailored to voriconazole and cipro at time of discharge.


Pt admitted yesterday [**3-10**] fasciculations and altered mental
status. Had been doing well on the floors except for complaints
of penile/bladder pain that was challenging to control with
methadone, morphine, percocet and dilaudid. Foley catheter was
placed to help with symptom relief (helped in previous
admissions).  This evening pt was noted to be febrile to 101.3
with SBP 60s-70s. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T101.2, HR106,
BP73/53, R20, 88%RA -> 96%2LNC. Pt was moaning in pain.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
POEMS syndrome manifested by polycythemia, polyneuropathy,
organomegaly, endocrinopathies including hypocalcemia,
hypothyroidism, hypogonadism and elevated PTH (diagnosed in
[**2099**]). In [**2101**] anasarca that eventually progressed to
respiratory failure, treated with plasmapheresis and prednisone
followed by  18 months of cyclophosphamide.
[**4-/2108**]/[**2108**]: Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 days 1,4,8,11 and
dexamethasone (20 mg days 1,2,4,5,8,9, 11, and 12) x three
cycles discontinued due to painful lower extremity neuropathy.
[**11/2108**] high dose cytoxan  for stem cell mobilization ([**11/2108**])
[**12/2108**] high dose melphalan with stem cell rescue ([**2108-12-9**])
In remission since than.
[**4-/2112**]: bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed dysplastic
basophilic and polychromatophilic erythroblasts, a marked left
shift and dysplastic myelopoiesis and abundant hyperchromic
megakaryocytes, which initially were felt to be consistent with
colchicine toxicity; however, chromosome studies performed on
that bone marrow material revealed an abnormal karyotype 15/16
studied cells showed a complex clone with the following
anomalies.  He had deletion in the long arm of chromosome 5
between band 5q13 and 5q33, otherwise known as 5q minus.  He had
monosomy 13, monosomy 17, monosomy 20, and addition of an
unidentified marker chromosome and [**2-12**] double minute
chromosomes.  These were all consistent with a myeloid
abnormality since there were not an increased number of blasts
much more consistent with MDS.

therapy)

5. prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy
6. gout
7. pulmonary HTN and restrictive lung disease
8. chronic kidney disease
9. C Dif ([**5-/2112**])

Social History:
Pt is a Ukrainian refugee who immigrated to the US in [**2049**]. He
lives with his wife and they have two sons. [**Name (NI) **] cigarettes, very
occasional alcohol. He works as a paint salesman for
[**Last Name (un) 34699**]-[**Location (un) 805**]. He is also a [**Country 3992**] veteran. Exposed to [**Doctor Last Name **]
[**Location (un) **], which he believes is the etiology of his POEMS.


Family History:
Mother is alive and has SLE, fibromyalgia. His father's medical
history is unknown. Half-sister with ovarian cancer.
