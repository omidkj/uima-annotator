History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 yo M with history of HTN, DM, anemia, who presents
with dyspnea. He was recently hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 55797**] for
pre-syncope in the setting of a junctional bradycardia.  He was
discharged to a [**Hospital 599**] Nursing Home in [**Location (un) 55**], where he
was experiencing worsening DOE in the last 2-3 days.  He also
complains of band-like chest discomfort while working with PT.
He denies nausea or vomiting with these episodes.  He also
denies lightheadedness/dizziness with these episodes as well.
.
During the patient's last admission, he was managed for
bradycardia likely due to hyperkalemia. Given his history of
claudication, his ASA was stopped and he was started on
clopidogrel. He was medically managed for presumed CAD despite a
pMIBI which did not show evidence of ischemia.  He was
discharged home on a clopidogrel, statin, and ACE-I.  He was not
started on a b-blocker due to his bradycardia at admission.
Also, the patient had cardiac enzymes on admission with a
trop<0.01 and CK 48.  His ECG was negative for ST segment
changes during that admission.
.
In the ED, his EKG showed new ST depressions in V5-V6.  CXR
showed new b/t pleural effusions.  His Hct was noted to be 24.6,
down from his baseline of 30.  He had an ABG on room air that
showed 7.51/26/59.  He was placed on a non-rebreather mask and
was unable to be weaned (86% RA).  He was placed on a heparin
gtt, given 1 unit pRBCS (guaiac negative), metoprolol 12.5, ASA
325 mg, and lasix 20 IV (put out approx 1000 cc).
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and dyspnea
on exertion (as described above), but he denies paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope, or
presyncope.
.
Patient does admit to exertional leg pain which he feels has
gotten worse.  He endorses occasional ankle edema.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary
veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Mildly dilated LV cavity. Mildly
depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
