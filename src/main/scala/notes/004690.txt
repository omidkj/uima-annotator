Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital3 17921**] Center,
[**Location (un) 5450**] [**Location (un) 3844**] intubated.  She has a newly diagnosis
of right lower lobe lung cancer with extrinsic compression.  She
was kept intubated.  A bedside flexible bronchoscopy was done at
the bedside which showed right middle bronchus, Bronchus
intermediate and right lower lobe patent. The subsegmental
bronchi and right middle lobe completely occluded with extrinsic
compression.  Impression: stage IV NSCLC that is ventilator
dependent. Unfortunately no effective endoscopic options to
optimize and increase chance of weaning to extubation.

A long conversation with her son [**Name (NI) **] and daughter [**Name (NI) 83056**] took
place.  Given the poor prognosis considering metastatic
malignancy with no reversible causes of respiratory failure.
Option of terminal wean was discussed with the family.  There
wishes were to have the patient transferred back to [**Location (un) 5450**].
