Brief Hospital Course:
76 y.o. M with hx of COPD and prior left pneumothorax, now
presenting at OSH with respiratory distress and found to have
right pneumothorax, s/p intubation and chest tube.

1. Respiratory Distress/Pneumothorax: Pt has long hx of severe
COPD and prior hx of pneumothorax, placing pt at risk for
spontaneous pneumo. Also there is some concern for recent
exacerbation and increased coughing, which may have caused his
pneumo. Chest tube is in place and on suction with resolved
pneumothorax on recent CXR. The patient was extubated on [**10-27**]
without complications. IP was consulted for management of chest
tube.  Chest tube placed to wall suction. Serial XRays followed.
 Pt was transferred to the medicine service on [**10-28**].  The Chest
tube was to water seal without air leak for 24 hours and then
pulled after chest xray confirmation of no PTX. Post Chest tube
films immediatedly and 12hrs after d/c of chest tube again
showed resolution of pneumothorax.  Antibiotics were restarted

2. COPD/asthma hx: Pt has hx decreased lung function with
obstructive disease. Per report of son pt had increased cough
and SOB at home, this is concerning for a COPD exacerbation.
Possible infection, since WBC is elevated to 17. However no
clear fevers. Had Solu-Medrol 125mg at OSH today. Initially,
started azithromycin but stopped this after no s/s of infection.
Placed on albuterol and ipratropium nebs standing.  Started pt's
Symbicort.

3. Demand Ischemia: Mildly elevated troponin and elevated CK.
EKG without concerning changes for ACS.  Patient likely had
demand ischemia from respiratory distress. Ruled out MI with CE
x 3.

4. Afib: EKG today in sinus. Restarted diltiazem.

5. Hypertension: Confirmed medication and restarted diltiazem.

6. Possible UTI: UA mildly positive. F/u urine culture. Held off
on abx treatment.

Code: confirmed full, per HCP

Primary Diagnosis:
1. Pneumothorax

Discharge Condition:
He was back at baseline breathing status on room  air at time of
discharge with no PTX on chest x-ray.


Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Location (un) 620**] after you were
intubated and found to have a collapsed lung on your right side.
the collapsed lung was thought to be a rupture of a bleb after
coughing, which you have had on your right side in the past. A
chest tube was placed in [**Location (un) 620**] to re-expand the lung. With us
your breathing was monitored closely and you were place on your
home breathign medications. You also had labwork that showed no
infection in your urine but did show some probably chronic
infection in your lungs, related to your COPD. When your chest
tube slowed in the amount it was draining and it showed no leak
in your lungs for 24 hours you had it removed and chest x-ray
was done to confirm that your lung was appropriately expanded.

Medication Changes:
None

Please see your PCP or go to your local emergency department if
you experience shortness of breath, increase in cough or sputum,
fevers, chest pain, or any other symptoms that concern you.
