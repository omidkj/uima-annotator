Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Here for BiV pacer placement by CT surgery (epicardial
placement)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Epicardial pacer placement by CT surgery

History of Present Illness:
87 y/o m with h/o cardiomyopathy EF 25-30%, felt not to be
ischemic although has declined stress testing or cath in the
past, h/o complete heart block with syncope s/p pacer placement
'[**27**], h/o prostate ca, htn comes in now as his EF has worsened
significantly and he has worsening DOE and felt to benefit from
biV pacing, however attempt to place CS lead was unsuccessful,
therefore he was admitted for epicardial LV lead placement,
which he underwent successfully [**9-12**] without complication. He
still has a R chest tube in place and his pacer appears to be
functioning appropriately and will be tx to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service.

EKG: AV paced at 70, biV pattern
CXR ([**9-12**]): RA and RV leads, and LV epicardial lead in expected
positions, L chest tube, no PTX, slight bibasilar atelectasis
.
[**9-16**] CXR: A permanent pacemaker remains in place with leads in
right atrium and right ventricle as well as additional
epicardial leads. There remains evidence of a small left pleural
effusion, not significantly changed in the interval. The lung
volumes are slightly improved since the recent study, and
atelectatic changes in the lower lobes are overall slightly
improved as well. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.

IMPRESSION: No significant change in small left pleural
effusion. Slight improvement in atelectatic changes, which
remain more prominent in the left lower lobe than the right.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o m with chb chf - post ct [**Doctor First Name **] implanted biv pacer.
.
1. rhythym: underlying 3rd degree AV block, with old RV lead, tx
to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] s/p LV epicardial lead, AV paced at 70 but in afib with
irregular response by pacer.  The patient was in afib underlying
his paced rhythm.  He was anticoagulated with heparin without
bolus and started on coumadin.  Amiodarone was started to
regulate underlying rhythm given the low EF and known benefit of
atrial kick in pts with low EF.  The EP service followed the
patient and repeatedly interrogated and changed the settings of
the pacemaker.  Atrial sensing threshold had to be repeatedly
decreased to allow for sensing of the atrial fib waves and
proper mode switching during fibrillatory states.  After this,
there was [**Last Name (un) 34425**] functioning of the pacemaker.
.
2. pump: EF 25-30%.  Until this hospitalization, had refused
stress testing or cath to investigate if there is an ischemic
component to his CHF.  He was managed with close I/Os, daily
weights, low salt diet, cont. coreg and accupril.  Because he
was likely over-diuresed prior to his transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**], causing
his increase in creatinine, he received fluids for a few days
without any SOB or evidence of fluid overload.  Once Creat had
decreased, his ACEI was restarted, fluids were stopped, and he
was convinced to undergo stress testing to investigate ischemia
(see below).  pMIBI estimated EF at >40%.
.
3. ischemia: Most recent Echo shows EF has decreased from 40 in
[**2134**] to 25-30% in [**Month (only) 116**], felt to be most consistent with
hypertensive cardiomyopathy.  However, because he had continued
to decline stress/cath, ischemic component was unknown.  Stress
at this hospitalization was conducted and showed no reversible
defects.  Coreg and accupril were continued as an OP and it was
suggested that OP physicians consider addition statin if has no
h/o intolerance for cardioprotection.  Low-dose ASA was started
for cardioprotection.
.
4. HTN: Coreg was continued for cardioprotection.  Due to rising
creatinine, d/c'd accupril and started nitrate/hydral.  This
caused periodic hypotension.  Medications were spread out
throughout the day and nitrate/hydral doses were decreased.
This decreased the hypotension, but did not resolve the issue.
When Creat normalized, restarted accupril with normalization of
BP and erradication of hypotensive events.
.
5. pulm: Pt initially had O2 requirement and CXR with some bilat
effusions stable x 3d after being tx to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] - thought to be
post-operative effusions that would resorb over time rather than
[**3-5**] fluid overload from CHF.  Daily CXR were monitored because
the pt was known to have a low EF and we were walking line of
fluids - creat had risen, but fluid overload would have been
easy to induce.  There was never clinical or radiographic
evidence of increasing fluid overload.
.
6. pain: well controlled by po percocet at decreasing doses
throughout the hosp course.
.
7. elev WBC: was elevated just after surgery, but normalized and
was thought to be a stress rxn.
