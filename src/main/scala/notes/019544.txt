Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
87 year old man with known severe 3-vessel CAD, PVD and CRI
(creatinine 2.0 baseline, now 2.3) presented [**6-20**] to outside
hospital with 10/10 sharp chest pain w/ mild SOB but no other
accompanying symptoms. Cardiac cath performed [**4-5**] for crescendo
angina and pt found to have 100% proximal RCA, 40% LM, 95%
proximal LAD, 80% OM1--no stents were placed and surgery was
deferred for medical management. Echo [**4-5**] showed LVEF 20-30%.
Medical management was unsuccessful and pt had continued
episodes of chest pain. At outside hospital, Troponin I peaked
at 0.72 and he was noted to have R > L pleural effusion on CT.
Patient has had no further chest pain since [**6-20**] and currently
reports 0/10 pain. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible
cardiac cath and stenting on enoxaparin, plavix, aspirin and
outside medications. He will also be reevaluated by cardiac
surgery for possible CABG.
.
On review of systems he denies SOB, chest pain, h/a, cough,
fevers/chills, [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain, diarrhea, burning with urination,
black stools or BRBPR. He sleeps with 2 pillows for help with
dizzyness but denies orthopnea or PND. He has constipation, last
BM this morning. He does report decreased appetite over last
week with ?15-lb weight loss over last week, no nausea or
vomiting.
.
Of note, nurse from outside hospital believes that the patient
underwent a swallowing study during the admission which was
abnormal and he was on thickened liquids and pureed food. Pt
reports some dysphagia with solid foods but which dislodge with
liquids.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**4-5**]:
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Severely depressed LVEF. No
resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Normal RV chamber
size. Focal apical hypokinesis of RV free wall.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Minimally increased gradient c/w minimal AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS.
Trivial MR. Prolonged (>250ms) transmitral E-wave decel time. LV
inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent)
secondary to extensive apical akinesis (involving the entire
apical half of the left ventricle) and severe hypokinesis of the
anterior septum and anterior free wall; there is some sparing of
the basal posterior wall. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of
the right ventricle. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression: severe left ventricular contractile dysfunction
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2117-4-8**] demonstrated:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant patient
revealed severe three vessel CAD. The RCA was proximally
occluded with distal left to right collaterals. The LMCA had
diffuse calcification with a distal taper of 40%. The LAD was a
very calcified diffusely diseased vessel with a 95% ostial
lesion with heavy calcification that extended into LCX origin.
The LCX was diffusely diseased with a 80% lesion in OM1.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated LVEDP of
26mmHG with systemic blood pressure of 125/55. There was no
gradient across the aortic valve and the rhythm was sinus.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with tight ostial LAD
and
occluded RCA
2. Diastolic dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo male with EF <20%, CRI, COPD and severe 3-vessel disease
s/p cypher stenting of LMCA and LAD requiring IABP.  IABP
removed day 2 post cath with baseline SBP's 88-110.  Condition
stable but guarded given severe CHF and difficulty balancing
cardiac function and renal perfusion.
.
#) ACS: ST elevation in anterior leads (change from prior) and
severely stenotic LAD on cath [**2117-4-8**], old Q-waves septal leads.
Surgery did not want to operate during last admission, but
medical management was unsuccessful. Cardiac catheterization and
cypher stenting of LMCA and LAD was performed with placement of
IABP. IABP removed post cath day 2 with overall stable blood
pressures since.
- discharge on ASA 325 daily, Plavix 75 daily, Atorvastatin 80mg
daily
-not on ACEI at this time given poor renal function
-NTG sublingual prn chest pain
.
#) Heart Failure with EF <20%, course complicated by poor
cardiac output and resulting renal hypoperfusion and pulmonary
congestion.
-Started on Carvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **] which he tolerated well, would
continue at this dose
-not started back on lasix as he has had elevated creatinine due
to renal hypoperfusion.  Recommend following daily weights and
dosing lasix gently if weight increasing.  Currently euvolemic
or slightly hypovolemic at weight of 60.5kg.
-Encourage po intake, see speech and swallow recommendations
below
-caution with IVF given very poor ejection fraction, pleural
effusions and baseline impaired pulmonary function due to COPD
.
#) CRI:(BL 1.9-2.0) Creatinine 2.4 on discharge which is down
from peak of 2.6 [**2117-7-1**]. Urine electrolytes, FENa and FEUrea
suggest that elevation due to prerenal etiology likely
combination of CHF with poor forward flow and element of volume
depletion.
-have not been giving lasix as likely volume depleted, prerenal
with poor po intake.
-holding ACEI
-please continue to encourage po
.
#) Hyperlipidemia: continue ezetemide 10 and atorvastatin 80 mg
daily
.
#) h/o prostate CA: he has some difficulty with urination
however no retention since removal of foley.

#) COPD: no change during admissi
