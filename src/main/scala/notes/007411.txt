Service:Internal Medicine
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12967**] [**Known lastname 174**] is a
34-year-old African American female with a past medical
history significant for a large saddle pulmonary
embolus with paradoxical aortic arch embolus s/p embolectomy with
patent foramen
ovale closure approximately five weeks prior to the time of
admission who presented with chest pain and shortness of
breath on [**9-29**] to the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 2142**]
[**Last Name (Titles) **].  The patient, as stated, had been admitted to the
[**Hospital6 1708**] approximately five weeks prior
to admission where she was found to have a massive pulmonary
arch of the aorta.  The patient underwent PFO closure and
embolectomy and was intubated for approximately three days,
status post surgery.  The post surgical period was evidently
complicated by patient noncompliance and although the plan
was to begin the patient on Coumadin at that time, she had
left against medical advice from [**Hospital6 15291**].  At this admission, the patient complains of two
weeks of worsening shortness of breath and chest pain.  The
patient states that she cannot finish a sentence or stand up
without worsening dyspnea.  The patient describes her chest
pain as a "[**9-28**] stabbing, burning pain, worsening with
motion, nonradiating and alleviated with Roxicet," which she
has been taking for the ten days prior to admission.  The
patient did complain of a cough at the time of admission.
The patient reports a temperature of 101.5 measured at home
for the two days prior to admission with some nausea at home,
however, the patient denied vomiting, diarrhea.  She did
complain of constipation.  The patient had been using oral
contraceptive pills prior to the time of admission to the
[**Hospital6 1708**] which she had discontinued by
the time of admission to the [**Hospital1 **].  The
patient did state that she quit tobacco use approximately two
weeks prior to admission.
She denied cough/sputum/hemoptysis/leg sxs.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peptic ulcer disease, pulmonary
embolus with patent foramen ovale and thrombus within the
arch of the aorta treated at the [**Hospital6 1708**]
with PFO closure and embolectomy during [**Month (only) 216**] of this year,
depression, hypotension, cesarean section, IVC filter placed
on [**Hospital6 1708**], status post jaw trauma.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  Temperature
98.8.  Blood pressure 112/91.  Weight was 271 pounds.  Pulse
oxygen 96% on one liter.  Respirations were approximately 26.
Mucous membranes were moist.  There was no trauma.  There
were no lesions in the oropharynx.  There was no
lymphadenopathy.  There was no noted jugular venous
distention, however, in this obese patient with a large neck,
this determination was difficult.  There were noted to be
crackles in the left middle lung field and egophony was later
noted in the left middle lung field as well.  The rate and
rhythm were regular without murmurs.  There was a question of
an extra heart sound.  On abdominal examination, this was a
markedly obese patient with a soft, nontender abdomen with
positive bowel sounds.  There was on examination of the chest
wall noted to be a small amount of serous drainage from the
wound site.

LABORATORY, X-RAY, ELECTROCARDIOGRAM AND OTHER TESTING:
Hematocrit at the time of admission was 30.7, white blood
cells 6.1, hemoglobin 9.4.  The differential was 58.1%
neutrophils, 32.8% lymphocytes, 4.2% monocytes, 4.3%
eosinophils, 0.6% basophils.  Platelets at the time of
admission were 471.  PT at the time of admission was 14.9,
PTT was 24.6, INR was 1.5.  Sedimentation rate measured on
[**10-1**] was 41.  Reticulocyte count measured on
[**10-3**] was 2.2.  Anti-thrombin III measured on
[**10-3**] was 88 with a normal range of 72 to 110, protein
C measured on [**10-3**] was 78 with a reference range of
67-123.  Urinalysis on [**9-29**] had a specific gravity of
1.011 and was otherwise negative.  Pleural fluid analysis
performed on [**10-2**] had 5,800 white blood cells,
hematocrit of 2.5%, 11% polys, 49% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes,
8% mesothelial cells and 28% macrophages.

Chem-7 at the time of admission was as follows:  Sodium 140,
potassium 4.3, chloride 103, bicarbonate 27, BUN 10,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 94, ALT measured on [**10-1**] was
19, AST on the same date was 18, alkaline phosphatase on the
same date was 155, total bilirubin was 0.2.  GGT measured on
[**10-2**] was 137, reference range of 8 to 35.  A troponin
measured on [**9-30**] was less than 0.3.  TIBC measured on
[**10-2**] was 311, ferritin 132, transferrin 239,
haptoglobin measured on [**10-5**] was 338, homocystine

4.8.  HIV antibody measured on [**10-5**] was negative.
Toxicology screen was negative.  Pleural chemistry in
addition to the above had a total protein of 3.3, a glucose
of 120, and an LDH of 289.  Multiple arterial blood gases
were done during this admission.  Please see the computer
record for further details.  Lactate measured on [**10-5**]
was 1.8 falling to 1.1 by [**10-7**].  Hematocrit at the
time of this dictation is 31.2 on [**10-15**], however,
hematocrit has been as low as 23.4 on [**10-3**] during a
period when the patient was anticoagulated.  PT at the time
of the current dictation is 14.7 with an INR of 1.2, PTT of
78.1 and the patient is on heparin.  Fibrinogen measured on
[**10-5**] was 654.

Gram stain from lingular transbronchial biopsy performed on
[**10-5**] showed no PMNs and no microorganisms.  Broth
from tissue did however grow out coag negative Staph, no acid
fast bacilli were seen on direct smear.  No fungus was
isolated.  Bronchial alveolar lavage performed on [**10-5**] yielded 1+ PMNs, no microorganisms, sparse oral pharyngeal
flora were seen, no acid fast bacilli were seen on direct
smear and no fungus was isolated.  PCP was not seen on
immunofluorescent tests.  Bronchial washings taken from
[**10-4**] showed 1+ PMNs and no microorganisms with sparse
oropharyngeal flora growth on culture and no fungal growth.
Pleural fluid from [**10-2**] had no PMNs and no
microorganisms with no growth on the culture media.  Blood
culture from [**10-1**] had no growth and that is the final
report as did a set of blood cultures from [**9-30**].
Testing for factor 5 Leiden was done and was negative for
mutation.

IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest CT performed on [**9-29**] showed
the following:

IMPRESSION:
1.  Left upper lobe and left lower lobe pneumonia with a
moderate left pleural effusion.
2.  A filling defect in the pulmonary artery going to the
left lower lobe consistent with a thrombus which is age
indeterminate.  This thrombus is nonocclusive given the
history of chronic pulmonary embolus and the consolidation of
left lung.  The desaturation is probably due to the
superimposed infection.  CT of the chest was repeated
multiple times.

The latest at the time of this dictation was from [**10-13**] which showed the following:
1.  Extensive ground glass opacity and reticulation
throughout the right lung with only minimal involvement of
the left lung.  The findings are nonspecific and could
reflect a symmetric distribution of hemorrhage, edema or
diffuse alveolar damage in the appropriate clinical setting.
2.  An enlarged main pulmonary artery and question of small
emboli in the branch of the left pulmonary artery, but no
large central
