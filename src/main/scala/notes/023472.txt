CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and cough.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57 year old
female with past medical history of polychondritis, initially
diagnosed in [**2157-11-16**], when the patient presented
bilateral ear inflammation.  Since the diagnosis, the patient
has been on Prednisone as well as trials of Methotrexate and
Cytoxan which she did not tolerate due to increased pulmonary
symptoms.  Because of cough and shortness of breath, the
patient was seen by a pulmonologist in [**2159-10-18**], who
performed bronchoscopy which revealed dynamic airway
collapse.  The issue of tracheal bronchial stenting was
raised but BIPAP, CPAP ventilation was initiated at that
time.  The patient was seen by rheumatology clinic here at
[**Hospital1 69**] in [**2159-11-17**], and
again in the beginning of [**Month (only) 404**] at which time her
Prednisone was decreased to 30 mg from 40 mg once daily.
There was a discussion of CellCept, however, that was not
initiated.

The patient was admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital in [**2159-12-18**], with respiratory decompensation treated with increased
steroids, BIPAP and nebulizers.  She was readmitted on
[**2160-2-8**], with increased shortness of breath at rest,
subacute in nature and progressive.  She denied any chest
pain, syncope, diaphoresis, fever, chills or sputum
production.  She reports not being able to cough up the
sputum.

At the outside hospital, Solu-Medrol, Levofloxacin, Lovenox,
Pepcid, nebulizer treatment and BIPAP were started and the
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].  In addition, the patient was noted to be in rapid
atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response rate of 150s
which was responsive to Diltiazem.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Polychondritis diagnosed in 12/99, with bilateral ear
inflammation, low [**Doctor First Name **] and C-negative.  Recently treated with
Prednisone and Methotrexate.  Methotrexate discontinued due
to cough.
2.  History of breast cancer, status post left mastectomy
thirty years ago.
3.  History of thyroid nodule.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Sulfa, Hydrochlorothiazide, Benadryl.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Albuterol nebulizer q4hours.
2.  BIPAP.
3.  Diltiazem 15 mg q1hour.
4.  Solu-Medrol 60 mg once daily.
5.  Levofloxacin 500 mg once daily.
6.  Levoxyl 120 mcg once daily.
7.  Robinul 1 mg twice a day.
8.  Lovenox 70 mg subcutaneous once daily.
9.  Digoxin 0.25 mg alternating with 0.125 mg once daily.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked thirty pack years, quit
about six months ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, pulse 88, blood pressure
127/66, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 92 to 94% on
CPAP mask set at 10/5.  Generally, the patient appeared
bloated with moon facies using accessory muscles of
respiration.  Skin was pink with dry mucous membranes.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - Extraocular
movements are intact.  Neck was obese, no obvious jugular
venous distention or lymphadenopathy was noted.  The heart
had distant sounds, regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no
obvious murmurs.  The lungs had inspiratory wheezes
bilaterally.  The lungs were without dullness or egophony.
The abdomen was obese, mildly distended with decreased bowel
sounds, nontender.  Extremities showed slight edema, no
cyanosis or clubbing.

LABORATORY DATA:  From outside hospital on [**2160-2-11**], white
blood cells 13.8, hematocrit 38.0, platelet count 311,000.
Chem7 showed sodium 145, potassium 4.5, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 30, blood urea nitrogen 25, creatinine 0.6,
glucose 205. Digoxin level 1.1.

Chest x-ray from outside hospital by report showed left
basilar atelectasis, no congestive heart failure or
infiltrate.  CT of the neck performed in [**2159-12-18**], showed
diffuse tracheal bronchial wall thickening with associated
air soft luminal narrowing with tracheal narrowing most
severe just above the level of the aortic arch and main stem
bronchi, right upper lobe bronchus and bronchus intermedius.
There were also nonspecific patchy ground glass opacities
within the upper lobes.

Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital showed sinus
tachycardia at 100 beats per minute, normal axis and normal
intervals, left atrial abnormality, right atrial abnormality.
No T wave changes or pathological Q waves.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 57 year old
female with relapsing polychondritis, breast cancer, status
post mastectomy, presenting with two months worsening
shortness of breath due to tracheal chondromalacia and
dynamic airway collapse.

During this hospitalization, the patient's issues included:
1.  Respiratory failure - Initially the patient was on BIPAP,
however, in the setting of desaturation to the mid 80s, the
decision was made to intubate.  Following intubation, the
patient underwent bronchoscopy which revealed diffuse airway
collapse especially at the trachea and the main stem bronchi.

The patient's respiratory failure could also have a component
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease given her thirty
pack year smoking history and a bicarbonate on admission of
35.

For a possibility of infection contributing to the patient's
pulmonary problem, the patient was continued on Levofloxacin
and Flagyl was added.  She was continued on her steroids as
well as Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.

The patient underwent second bronchoscopy on [**2160-2-13**], with
bilateral main stem and tracheal stent placements.  Over the
next few days, her sedation was decreased and trials of
extubation were initiated.  Her sputum culture grew gram
positive cocci for which she was started on Vancomycin in
addition to Levofloxacin and Flagyl.

In light of persistent airway collapse distant to the stents,
at extensive family discussions, the patient's code status
was changed to "Do Not Resuscitate".  As sedation was weaned
down, the patient expressed wish to be extubated.  The
patient wished not to be reintubated in case she would not be
able to support herself.  The patient was extubated on
[**2160-2-18**].  She was not able to support her ventilation or
oxygenation and was pronounced dead at 7:16 p.m. on [**2160-2-18**].
The family declined autopsy.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Respiratory failure due to dynamic airway
collapse from advanced polychondritis leading to
tracheomalacia.

2.  Infectious disease - The patient did spike fevers for
which antibiotics were initiated.  Besides gram positive
cocci in the sputum, all her cultures were negative.

3.  Rheumatoid  disease - Polychondritis - The patient was
continued on steroids with attempts to wean them.
Rheumatology consultation was also following the patient.

4.  Cardiovascular - During this hospitalization, the patient
had runs of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response rate for which she was continued on Diltiazem and
Digoxin.

5.  Endocrine - For her increased blood sugar on steroids,
the patient was maintained on NPH and regular sliding scale
insulin.  For her hypothyroidism, she was continued on
Levoxyl.

6.  Access - On [**2160-2-15**], right IJ was placed without
complications.  In addition, for monitoring of blood pressure
and respiratory status, left radial arterial line was placed.

7.  Prophylaxis - During hospitalization, the patient was
continued on Protonix and subcutaneous Heparin for
prophylaxis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypoxic and hypocarbic respiratory failure.
2.  Polychondritis.
3.  Tracheomalacia and dynamic airway collapse, status post
airway stenting.
4.  Breast cancer.
5.  History of thyroid nodule.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.
