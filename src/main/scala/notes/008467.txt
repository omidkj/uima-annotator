Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness and lightheadedness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 45yo F PMHx fibromyalgia, UC, COPD who presented to
OSH w suddent onset dizziness, found to have new onset [**Hospital **]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  Patient reports
that at 5pm on day prior to transfer, she was in front of her
house finishing some yard work when she had a single episodes of
dizziness that she described as "being at the top of a
rollercoaster", which lasted for several seconds with
spontaneous resolution; associated with subsequent palpitations,
and without any exacerbating/relieving factors that she could
identify.  No associated chest pain, SOB, HA, syncope, visual
changes, neck pain, fevers/chills, vomiting/diarrhea, BRBPR,
dysuria.  Patient reports she No recent change in medications.
Smokes 1pk/day, drinks 8 cups coffee/day.
.
On day of admission, patient awoke with indigestion and
palpitations.  Patient went to previously scheduled OBGYN visit,
where she was noted to have a rapid heart rate, prompting a
referral to OSH ED.  At OSH patient was noted to be in a wide
complex tachycardia. She received 6mg + 12 mg IV adenosine
without resolution of tachycardia.  She received a bolus of
amiodarone, started on amio drip, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation and management.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial
vital signs were BP 113/76  HR 137  RR 16  O2Sat98%/2LNC.  EKG
demonstrate regular monomorphic wide complex tacycardia c/w LV
septal VT.  Physical exam was significant for comfortable
patient without any distress, otherwise unremarkable.  CBC,
Chem7, cardiac enzymes were unremarkable.  Patient was continued
on amiodarone drip at 1mg/min.  Attempts at conversion were made
with IV adenosine 6mg, then 12mg, as well as verapamil 5mg
without resolution of VT.  Patient was given ASA 325mg and
admitted to CCU for further management.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is comfortable, reports
palpitations, denies CP/SOB.  On review of systems, patient
reported 1 month of cough.  Review of systems otherwise
negative.

CXR [**2105-11-23**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the outside study of this date, the
cardiac
silhouette remains within normal limits and there is no evidence
of acute
focal pneumonia. The pulmonary vessels are not as sharply seen,
raising the possibility of mild elevation of pulmonary venous
pressure.
.
ECHO:[**2105-11-24**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular
systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
45yo F PMHx w/o known cardiac history presented with new onset
VT, otherwise hemodynamically stable, without clear underlying
etiology.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Idiopathic Left Ventricular Tachycardia (ILVT):  Admitted with
sustained wide monomorphic tachycardia without hemodynamic
compromise. Her VT was felt to be ILVT because of the RBBB
morphology, relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15015**] QRS with needlepoint R in V1 and
lack of structural or ischemic heart disease. She was given
Adenosine and verapamil 5mg in the ED which failed to convert
her rhythm. She was then transferred to the CCU where she
received procainamide with prompt conversion to NSR. An Echo
done the day of discharge did not reveal structural
abnormalities. She was started on verapamil SR 240mg daily for
VT suppression and discharged with the plan to follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an EP study and potential ablation.
.
# Anxiety: Patient was given Ativan to help with anxiety. The
patient was informed that this medication is highly addictive,
so if she continues to have anxiety after the VT ablation, she
should discuss anxiety with her PCP and consider [**Name Initial (PRE) **] long acting
anti-anxiety medication such as an SSRI to prevent anxiety
before it starts and avoid addictive benzodiazepines.  She was
instructed that Ativan is a sedative and so she should NOT
drive, operate heavy machinery, or make important decisions
while on this medication.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Ulcerative Colitis: Diagnosed [**2099**], per patient well
controlled at this time. Continued balsalazide and recommended
outpatient follow up to try and control her UC while also try to
help with tobacco cessation.
.
# Fibromyalgia: On Savella as outpatient. This was briefly as it
may infrequently cause tachycardia. This medication was
restarted because it is highly unlikey to have cuased her VT.
.
# COPD: Had some mild SOB and wheezing while admitted which
improved without nebulizers/inhalers. She sporadically takes
Advair at home.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Cardiac MRI: Mrs. [**Known lastname 33704**] would likely benefit from cardiac MR
which we would recommend on an outpatient basis to evaluate her
anatomy prior to possible VT ablation.
