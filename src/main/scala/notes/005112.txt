HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 81 year-old
male with a history significant for coronary artery disease
status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2108**],
hypertension, congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 45% who was admitted to an outside hospital on
[**2119-3-7**] when he presented with worsening shortness of
breath and dyspnea.

Three days prior to his admission the patient was developing
upper respiratory symptoms predominately scratchy throat and

of congestive heart failure he was diuresed with Lasix,
started on aspirin and given Morphine and Nitroglycerin.

The following day he worsened and repeat echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction down to 30% with new anteroapical
hypokinesis.  He was stabilized and transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] Coronary Care Unit for
further care.  On his second day of admission Cardiothoracic
surgery was asked to evaluate the patient.

97% on nonrebreather mask.  He is alert and oriented times 3,
no acute distress.  His pupils are equal, round and reactive
to light.  He has 7 cm JVP.  He has bilateral rales one

has regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission include white count 12.5,
hematocrit 45, platelet count 172, 000.  Sodium 140,
potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 22, BUN 22,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 249.

CPK #1 was 95. CPK #2 was 109.  CPK #3 was 120.

EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 60, normal axis, Qs in III and
aVF. ST elevations in V1 and V2.

Echocardiogram from [**2119-3-8**] showed ejection fraction of 30%,
hypokinesis of anteroapical with marked hypokinesis of
inferior wall.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is admitted to the CCU.  On
hospital day one he underwent a cardiac catheterization which
showed three vessel disease of the LAD and 90% proximal
lesion. The left circumflex and right coronary artery were
occluded proximally. At that time he had an intra aortic
balloon pump placed as well. Troponin was measured during his
admission; #1 was 10.7, 20.49 and #3 was 19%.

The patient was stabilized and then on hospital day five the
patient went to the operating room and underwent acute
coronary artery bypass graft times three with a LIMA to the
diagonal, saphenous vein graft to RCA and saphenous vein
graft to the LAD.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and left the operating room with drips of Milrinone of 0.25
mics per kilograms per minute and Levofloxacin 0.2 mics per
kilograms per minute and transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition, intra aortic balloon pump one to
one with good augmentation

On postoperative day one the patient was extubated.  The
intra aortic balloon pump was weaned 1 to 3 and then was
weaned.

On chest x-ray he was noted to have a left lower lobe
consolidation and there was question of aspiration. He had
speech and swallow evaluation which was positive for thin
liquids and was placed on strict aspiration precautions.  A
nasogastric tube was placed due to the failed swallow study.
He was started on ProMod with fiber to a goal of 70 cc an
hour.

On postoperative day three the patient was noted to go into
rapid atrial fibrillation with stable blood pressure.  He was
given Lopressor 5 milligrams times four with no affect. He
was then loaded with Amiodarone. He had a bradycardic
response and was paced during this time. Blood pressure
remained stable though.

On postoperative day four the patient underwent modified
barium swallow study which showed moderate oropharyngeal
swallow dysfunction, no frank aspiration but was significant
for ...................  He was then placed on strict
aspirations per precautions and placed on thick liquids with
slow advancement. He is continued on tube feeds.

Over the next few days the patient remained stable. He was
afebrile. He was continued on beta-blocker, began a calcium
channel blocker and was continued on Amiodarone.  He was on
full thickened liquids and tube feeds.

On postoperative day seven the patient was then transferred
to the floor for the remainder of his recovery.  His
temperature is 98 F. His wires were discontinued.  His Foley
catheter was discontinued. He received Physical Therapy. He
is currently at a level V.  ORL evaluation evaluated his
swallowing and noted that he should still be monitored and
left on pureed and nectar thick liquids.  His diet was
advanced and calorie count was obtained which demonstrated
that the patient was able to achieve his total caloric needs
via po.  His Dobbhoff was removed. The patient now has been
tolerating po diet without problem.

On postoperative day nine the patient's laboratory was noted
to have potassium of 6.1.  He was treated with Kayexalate,
continuous insulin and an amp of D50, and a calcium
gluconate. His potassium came down to 5.4 appropriately.
Renal consult was seen. The patient was placed on a renal
diet which was low potassium. He was started on Florinef as a
mineral "replacement".  The patient's latest potassium is
4.4.

It was noted also the patient's blood sugars had been ranging
anywhere from 81 to 300.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and they made
adjustments to his sliding scale and his hypoglycemic
regimen.

The patient is now stable and is now ready to go home,
discharged on postoperative day 13.
