HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 63-year-old male with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dependent
on home oxygen and chronic steroids, presented to [**Hospital 21145**]
Hospital with complaints of increasing shortness of breath
over one week with decreased p.o. intake times three weeks.
At Brochton, the patient became increasingly less responsive.
An ABG revealed a pH of 7.04, carbon dioxide of 157, and pO2
of 138.  The patient was intubated for hypocarbic respiratory
failure.  The patient was also given 80 mg IV Lasix to which
he diuresed approximately 2.5 L.  The patient's blood
pressure was found to be 30 mmHg different in each arm, and
his chest x-ray revealed what was read as a widened
mediastinum.  The patient had progressively hypotensive, and
there was concern that the patient had an aortic dissection.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] to rule out aortic dissection.

A CT of the chest was done which revealed no dissection but
revealed right middle lobe collapse.  At [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was also felt to
have 1-2 mm ST segment elevations inferolaterally.  The
patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization which revealed
normal coronaries.  The patient was started on Dopamine for
hypotension prior to being catheterized.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease on home oxygen and chronic steroids.  2.
Hypotension.  3.  Nephrolithiasis.  4.  Osteoporosis.  5.
Upper extremity spasticity of unclear etiology.  6.  History
of fatty mass, question lipoma, on chest imaging (unclear as
to whether diagnosed by biopsy or CT).

ALLERGIES:  GATIFLOXACIN CAUSES A RASH.

MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone, Albuterol and Atrovent nebs,
Baclofen 20 mg p.o. t.i.d., Multivitamin, Calcium Carbonate,
Fosamax, Aspirin, B12, Flovent, Serevent.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has a
50+ pack-year history of tobacco and quit two years ago.  The
patient reported heavy alcohol use but quit ten years prior
to admission.  The patient has a history of asbestos
exposure.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Heart rate 80, blood
pressure 80s to 90s over 50s.  General:  The patient was
intubated and sedated.  He was in no apparent distress.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.  Heart:  Regular, rate
and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops
appreciated.  Pulmonary:  The patient had diffuse expiratory
wheezes.  Abdomen:  The patient's belly was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  Rectal:  Guaiac positive.  Extremities:
the patient had 2+ pitting edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's white blood cell count was
9.5, hematocrit 42.1, platelet count 296,000; INR 1.4; CHEM7
revealed a sodium of 139, potassium 4.6, chloride 94, bicarb
31, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, initial CK was 124; the patient's
ABG improved to 7.43 with a pH, with a pCO2 of 52, and a pO2
of 106, once on the vent.

CT of the chest revealed no aortic dissection, mildly dilated
aorta at 4 cm, right middle lobe collapse, mediastinal shift
to the right, axillary mediastinal nodes approximately 1 cm
and focal ................. of the right hemidiaphragm.

CT of the abdomen was read as unremarkable.  CT of the pelvis
was read as unremarkable.

Cardiac catheterization revealed no significant coronary
artery disease.  Ejection fraction was 65%.  No wall motion
abnormalities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 63-year-old man with severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease was admitted for hypercarbic
respiratory failure and likely chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation was found to have right middle lobe
collapse that was initially concerning for malignancy.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated and ventilated.  He
was given Atrovent and Albuterol MDIs.  He was started on
Solu-Medrol 80 mg IV q.8 hours.  The patient also received
Ceftriaxone 1 g IV q.24.  Sputum cultures were sent.  The
patient underwent bronchoscopy which revealed no
endobronchial masses.  Brushings revealed no malignant cells,
and bronchial washings revealed reactive atypia but could not
rule out carcinoma.

The patient steroids were tapered over the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course.  On the fourth day of hospitalization, the patient
was tried on pressor support.  He was limited by the amounts
of tidal volume that he could create, as well as increasing
respiratory rate.  The patient was aggressively diuresed with
Lasix and was able to diurese 1-1.5 L/day.  He was grossly
total body volume overloaded.


On the sixth day of hospitalization, he was tried on pressor
support and did quite well.  He was tried on pressor support
5 and 5 with an ABG of 7.45, pCO2 56, pAO2 81, 95%
saturation.  The patient was successfully extubated.  He was
gradually weaned to 3 L nasal cannula.  His Solu-Medrol IV
was changed to Prednisone 40 mg q.d.  The patient's IV
Ceftriaxone was changed to .............. 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Cardiovascular:  The patient required pressors after his
heart catheterization.  It was also thought that he had some
element of autopeeping.  His PEEP was maintained at 5.  The
patient was weaned off Dopamine on the second day of
admission.  A central venous catheter was placed in the right
IJ position.  His CVPs were monitored and ranged from [**8-12**].
He was aggressively diuresed for 1.5 L on the average per
day.

After extubation, the patient experienced hypertension into
the 170s and 180s systolic.  He was started on Thiazide
diuretic 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. as Hydrochlorothiazide.

GI:  The patient was found to have a firm, distended belly
after admission.  He had not had a bowel movement in several
days.  An aggressive bowel regimen was started after a KUB
revealed no obstruction and no perforation.  The patient
responded well to Dulcolax.  His belly became quite soft
after several bowel movements.

CODE STATUS:  Initial discussions with the family had
revealed that the patient had expressed wishes not to be
resuscitated and not to be intubated.  They also felt that he
would not want a tracheostomy.  When the patient was
extubated, family discussion was held with the patient's two
daughters, wife, as well as the patient.  At this point, he
felt that he would like to be resuscitated should his heart
stop, including receiving electric shock and CPR.  The
patient also expressed wishes to be reintubated, should he
fail after extubation.  He would also desire tracheostomy if
he were to be intubated for the long term.  His family was in
accordance with these wishes and wished to respect the
patient's desires for care.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will likely be discharged to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Osteoporosis.
5.  Upper extremity spasticity.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to a
rehabilitation hospital.  He will be arranged to have
follow-up with the Pulmonary Clinic here at [**Hospital6 1760**].  The patient was advised to
follow-up with his primary care physician within in one week
after discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  TUMS 500 mg p.o. t.i.d., Albuterol
and Atrovent nebulizer treatments q.4 hours as needed for
shortness of breath and wheezing, Prednisone 40 mg p.o. q.d.
to be tapered, Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.,
Cefpodoxime 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  The patient may resume his
outpatient regimen of Baclofen 20 mg p.o. t.i.d., Fosomax 1
mg q.week, Flovent MDI, Serevent MDI, B12, Aspirin,
Multivitamin.
