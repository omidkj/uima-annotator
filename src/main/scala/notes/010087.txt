History of Present Illness:
* Pt intubated and with no accompanying family so below
information obtained from ED report and OMR review*
86 yr/o F with Hx of metastatic breast CA (lungs, skull bones),
DVT (on Fragmin via study protocol), HTN (on nifedipine) who
presented to clinic today for an appointment feeling acutely
SOB.
.
O2 sat found to be 60% on RA when EMS arrived. She was placed on
a NRB and found to be 77% with this on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Initial vitals showed HR 138 and SBP > 200. Pt found to have
bilateral rales, perioral cyanosis, 2+ pittle LE edema, and very
poor mental status unable to answer questions or discuss code
status. EKG was reported to have peaked T waves V1-V4 as well as
? j point elevationand LBBB (known LBBB in past).  Cards fellow
thought T waves rate related and did bedside ECHO with normal EF
but hypokinesis in LAD distribution. Pt was given 40mg IV lasix,
750mg IV levofloxacin, and Nitro paste, and transiently put on
BiPAP but was believed to be fatiguing within 5 min so was
intubated with propofol in the ED. SBP fell to 80s with propofol
and intubation so pt received a 600cc bolus. ETT pulled back
from 25 to 23 in ED.
.
At time of transfer to CCU pt had put out 150cc urine and had
vitals showing HR 77, BP 125/73, O2 Sat 100% on CMV TV 500, RR
20, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%. Gas showed 7.32 / 52 / 100 / 28 with
PaO2/FiO2 100 but question that this gas was drawn at same time
as being intubated and without full effect of vent as repeat gas
on vent settings CMV TV 500, PEEP 5, RR 14, FiO2 100% showed
7.42 / 44 / 392 / 30.
.
LE swelling first noted by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-25**] both by pt report that
Heme/Onc doctor told her she needed lasix and by exam in PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 3726**]. Started on 20mg PO lasix in Feburary. Heme/Onc note
reports leg swelling last year found to be DVT in [**2142-2-12**] and
has been on Dalteparin via [**Company 2860**] protocol since. This new
swelling is apparently different than past DVT swelling and had
raised question of cardiac congestive cause in ambulatory
setting.
.
Per brief discussion with HCP [**Name (NI) 4457**], pt is an avid musician and
plays the trumpet. Roughly 1 week ago patient started
complaining of trouble holding her air playing the trumpet which
had never been a problem before.

ECHO [**2143-3-6**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
distal septum and apex. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50-55 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Cannot exclude
aortic stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.

CTA Chest [**2143-3-6**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Severe pulmonary edema, scattered subsegmental atelectasis,
and moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left. It should be noted that processes such as pulmonary
hemorrhage can have a similar appearance. Given substantial
parenchymal abnormality, supervening consolidation or focal
lesion cannot be excluded.

CXR [**2143-3-7**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval redistribution of bilateral opacities from
upper to
lower zones. Overall mild improvement of now mild-to-moderate
pulmonary
edema. Endotracheal tube now in standard position.
