Brief Hospital Course:
This pleasant 85 year old female was admitted posteroperatively
to the BLUE surgical service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**]. She
underwent a laparascopic cholecysectomy with intraoperative
cholangiogram and direct laryngoscopy (because of reports of
voice changes after [**Month (only) **] according to her son) on [**2199-4-30**]. Please
see operative report for futher details on the procedure and
intra-op findings. A few hours after the surgery, she had two
episodes of emesis, but was otherwise stable. She had her
electrolytes repleted. She did however remain in the PACU
overnight because of her labile blood pressure.  She tolerated
her clear liquid diet and was advanced to a low fat diet on the
morning of postoperative day two. She did have some confusion
after being transferred to the floor and required a sitter
overnight. Her narcotic pain medication was discontinued and the
patient did not require any further pain medication. She was
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] Facility on [**2199-5-4**],
postoperative day 4 with a Foley catheter in place due to her
ongoing diuresis.
