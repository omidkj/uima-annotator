HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a patient who has known
breast carcinoma with questionable metastatic disease who is
receiving radiation therapy and she was brought onto the
medical service and evaluated for shortness of breath. A CT
scan showed a large chronic dissection of her aorta with an
aneurysmal enlargement below the renal. Her left renal artery
is noted to come off the false lumen. The patient returns now

arteries. The patient is a type 2 diabetic, controlled. The
patient has pruritus and periorbital edema.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral lumpectomies with radiation
therapy and CMP. The patient's ejection fraction is 25%. She
also has a history of hyperlipidemia. The patient is a known
smoker. She quit 20 years ago. She smoked 13 pack years. She
does admit to a gin and tonic at bed time.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Diovan, Coreg, Lasix, simvastatin,
Ativan, omeprazole, paroxetine, lisinopril, Colace.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Unremarkable. She had Dopplerable DP
and PTs bilaterally and palpable DPs bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2130-2-14**]. She underwent an
abdominal aortic resection. She was transferred to the PACU
in stable condition. Her postoperative hematocrit was 32.5,
BUN 6, creatinine 0.9. The patient was neurologically intact.
She had palpable DPs bilaterally. The patient went into flash
pulmonary edema on postoperative day 1 and was transferred to
the ICU for continued care from the PACU. The patient
remained intubated. The patient's postoperative pain was
controlled with epidural infusion. Pressors were weaned off.
Lasix for diuresis was begun. Her triple lumen catheter was
rewired. She remained in the SICU. Beta-blockade was
increased for heart rate management.

On postoperative day #3, the patient had an episode of mental
status change. A CT was done which was negative for acute
bleed or infarct. Ativan was discontinued. She continued to
be diuresed for a goal of 1.5 L/24 hours. The patient was
extubated on postoperative day 3 and transferred to the VICU
for continued monitoring and care. Lopressor was increased
and hydralazine was discontinued. Subcu heparin was
continued. Physical examination showed diminished breath
sounds at the bases. The remaining exam was unchanged. She
had palpable DP and PT bilaterally. She was afebrile. Her
white count was 8.7, hematocrit 31.8. The patient's EKG
postoperatively was without any ST changes. Her troponin was
less than 0.01.

Ambulation to chair was begun on postoperative day 4.
Physical therapy was requested to see the patient in
anticipation for discharge planning. The epidural was
discontinued. She was converted to oral agents. The patient
demonstrated on postoperative day 5 with a much improved lung
exam. Chest x-ray was improved. Ambulation was begun. Diet
was advanced as tolerated with aspiration precautions.
Hyperkalemia was repleted.

On postoperative day #6, the patient was weaned by physical
therapy. We felt the patient would be able to be discharged
to home with physical therapy. The patient continues to
progress. She will need to be evaluated for rehab. OT was
requested to see the patient to evaluate cognitive of
function. The patient will be discharged when medically
stable and cleared by physical therapy.
