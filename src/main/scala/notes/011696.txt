CXR [**2169-4-3**]:
1. Interval increase in the left basal effusion with progressive
left lower
lobe collapse when compared to the chest radiograph of [**2169-3-13**].

2. Stable right basal effusion with areas of added density in
the right lower
lobe suggestive of superimposed infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, the patient had a left thoracentesis, one liter
removed and was symptomatically imprved. He was admitted to the
ICU for tachypnea with RR 40, but then improved to RR 20's.
Initially, he had a high O2 requirement - 87% RA in the ED, 92%
on 4L, 98% on 5L. He received dialysis in the ICU and his oxygen
levels improved to 100% on 3LNC. The interventional pulmonary
service consulted on this patient - as he is followed by them
closely as an outpt- and recommended removal of right pleurex
and placement on a new left pleurex after plavix wash out. The
patient was tranfered to the floor in stable condition. While on
the floor, he remained stable, with his O2 saturation 95-97% on
2-3L NC. He had no tachypnea or pleuritic chest pain while on
the floor. He had dialysis x1 on the floor. He is being d/c home
with home VNA for daily vital signs/lung exam to be sure
effusion not returning while patient at home.

([**4-6**])


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for shortness of breath that was associated
with a recurrent pleural effusion (fluid on your lungs) on the
left side. This effusion was drained and your shortness of
breath improved over the following two days. You will need an
additional drainage of this fluid and a placment of a temporary
