ambulation. Reports not being able to walk more than 200-300
feet without getting short of breath; has been getting
progressively worse. The day prior to admission notes that his

Imaging:
[**2179-11-4**] EKG: nsr at 92, TWI V1-V6, STD V4-V5, NSST changes 2, 3,
avf, no stemi, no prior.
[**2179-11-4**] CXR: The cardiac and mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. The lungs are clear. There appears to be oligemia
to the right lung base with a cut off of the right lower lobe
pulmonary artery ([**Last Name (un) 92544**] sign), suspicious for a pulmonary
embolus. Prominence of the
hila is noted bilaterally. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
is resent.
There are no acute osseous abnormalities. IMPRESSION: Oligemia
of the right lower lobe suggestive of pulmonary embolus. CTA of
the chest is recommended for further evaluation.
[**2179-11-4**] CTA: Bolus timing is diagnostic for assessment of the
pulmonary arteries to the subsegmental level. Extensive
pulmonary emboli are present bilaterally, involving the distal
right main pulmonary artery as well as the lobar, segmental, and
subsegmental branches bilaterally. Dilation of the right
ventricle and widening of the main pulmonary artery to 3.4 cm
are highly concerning for right ventricular strain and pulmonary
hypertension.
The lungs are clear. No consolidations or pleural effusions are
present. No mediastinal, hilar, or axillary adenopathy is
present. Several small
non-pathologic mediastinal nodes are observed. Visualized
portions of the
upper abdomen are limited but show no abnormalities. There are
no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with findings
concerning for right ventricular strain.
[**2179-11-5**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are not well
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2179-11-5**] LENI: 1. Nonocclusive deep venous thrombus in the left
popliteal vein. 2. The left peroneal vein was not visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 92543**] is a 60M with PMH of nephrolithiasis who is
presenting with 4 days of DOE, found to have elevated D-dimer,
and large b/l PE on CTA.
.
# Pulmonary embolus:  Patient was found to have a large b/l PE
on CTA, accounting for his DOE.  D-dimer was found to be 2815,
and BNP elevated to 2394; troponins were negative. ECG on
admission showed NSR at 92, TWI V1-V6, STD V4-
