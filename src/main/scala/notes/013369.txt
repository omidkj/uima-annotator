Chief Complaint:
L IT femur fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left open reduction internal fixation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 y/o F with PMHx of DM II and HTN, who was
initially
aditted on [**10-24**] to the orthopedics service with L femur fx from
mechanical fall. She underwent left hip ORIF on [**10-25**]. On POD #2
([**10-27**]), medical team was consulted for hypoxia. Patient had
2-3LNC O2 requirement since surgery, but acutely worsened over
the course of [**10-26**], where she was hypoxic to the 70s on RA, and
low 90s on 10L ventimask. She was found to have PE on CTA and
was started on heparin gtt. She was also started on vancomycin
and cefepime empirically for HCAP before being transferred to
the MICU. While in the MICU she was initially on NRB, but has
been weaned to 3 O2.
Currently, patient is sleeping comfortably, but awakens easily.
With her daughter translating, she notes persistent SOB and
cough. She denies any pain at this time, but has had persistent
soreness from her surgical site. She reports having a fever 2
days ago.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria.

IMAGING:
Knee Xray
FINDINGS:  Two views of the left knee were obtained.  Severe
osteoarthritic changes are seen, including lateral greater than
medial joint space narrowing and adjacent tibial plateau
irregularity.  No suprapatellar joint effusion is seen.
Condylar spurring is noted.

Hip Xray:
FINDINGS:  AP view of the pelvis and AP and lateral views of the
left hip were obtained.  There is a comminuted left
intertrochanteric fracture with varus angulation of the left
femoral head.  No dislocation is seen.  The pubic symphysis and
sacroiliac joints are intact.  Degenerative changes are seen
along the lower lumbar spine.  Soft tissue calcifications are
seen overlying bilateral buttock at the level of superior iliac
[**Doctor First Name 362**] may represent calcified granulomas.

IMPRESSION:  Comminuted left intertrochanteric fracture with
varus angulation of the left femoral head.

Hip Xray post ORIF:
FINDINGS:  Two spot films from the OR were obtained.  There is a
total of
136.0 seconds of fluoroscopy time.  There is interval placement
of an
intramedullary rod and hip screw.  At the end of the procedure
the alignment was good.

CTA [**2133-10-27**]:
FINDINGS:  The pulmonary vasculature is well opacified and with
an eccentric nonocclusive filling defect noted in the
subsegmental branches of the right upper lobe (3:14).  No other
lobes appear affected.  Heart size is normal without evidence of
right heart strain.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are evident
within the thoracic aorta without aneurysmal dilatation or
dissection.

CT CHEST:  There is no supraclavicular or axillary
lymphadenopathy identified. Multiple lymph nodes are noted
within the prevascular, right upper paratracheal and subcarinal
space, none of which meet CT criteria for pathological
enlargement.  No hilar lymphadenopathy identified.  Secretions
are evident within the segmental and subsegmental branches of
the bilateral lower lobe airways with associated partial left
lower lobe collapse.  Of note, area of left lower lobe collapse
is hypodense to surrounding collapsed lung concerning for
developing pneumonia  (3:38).  No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax identified.

Limited assessment of the abdomen demonstrates a
normal-appearing liver,
pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands.

No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions identified.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Subsegmental pulmonary embolism of the right upper lobe. No
right heart strain.
2.  Secretions within the segmental and subsegmental branches of
the bilateral lower lobes and associated partial left lower lobe
collapse with areas of relative hypodensity. Findings consistent
with aspiration complicated by developing pneumonia.   No
pleural effusion identified.

Echo [**2133-10-27**]:
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD or PFO
by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). No resting LVOT
gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP. Mild mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of
papillary muscles.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 1 iv
injection of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline at rest. Suboptimal
image quality as the patient was difficult to position.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No PFO or ASD. Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
