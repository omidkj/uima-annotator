Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old
male with a history of COPD and bipolar disorder, who was
living in a group home, and was recently admitted from
[**8-15**] to 18th for hypoxia and lethargy, who again
presents with dyspnea and hypoxia.  On the previous
admission, he was treated with steroids and oxygen with a
quick response.

He then returned to the group home with visiting nurses and
nebulizer treatments.  However, on the day prior to
admission, he did not return to the group home until about 3
a.m. arriving intoxicated and he had not had his prn
medications, dyspneic, and was sent to the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department, where his blood gas was
7.26/83/69, started on BiPAP, and given IV Solu-Medrol 125 mg
as well as IV Levaquin 500 mg, and albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers x3.  His ABG improved to 7.3/74/83, and was
changed to oxygen by nasal cannula with an ABG of 7.28/80/42,
and then again put on BiPAP.  He had been given Ativan in the
Emergency Department for agitation and became quite
lethargic.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for productive cough, and he was
then decided to be transferred to the MICU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD.
2. Bipolar disorder.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Zyprexa 20 q.d.
2. Prednisone 20 t.i.d.
3. Depakote 1,000 t.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Notable for 1.5-2 packs/day of cigarettes.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, the patient was afebrile with
a pulse of 109, blood pressure 146/76, respiratory rate 24,
and sating at 98% BiPAP.  In general, he was alternately
agitated and sleepy.  Head and neck examination:  His pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
His extraocular movements were intact, and mucous membranes
are moist.  His cardiac examination was notable for having
regular, rate, and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
On lung examination, he had coarse breath sounds and diffuse
expiratory wheezes which was particularly worse at the bases.
On abdominal examination, he was soft, nontender,
nondistended with active bowel sounds.  His extremities had
no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema with 1+ peripheral pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 6.9 with a hematocrit of
36.1 with 67 polys and 20 lymphocytes, platelets of 226.  His
chemistries were notable for a bicarb of 32 and his calcium,
magnesium, and phosphorus were normal.  His serum and urinary
tox screens were negative.  His ABGs were as noted above.

He had a chest film that showed evidence of COPD and
prominence of the right hilum and bibasilar atelectasis, but
no infiltrate.

His EKG taken several days before on his previous admission
was in normal sinus rhythm.  On admission, patient's EKG was
notable for early R-wave progression.  Was slightly different
from the original EKG, but not significantly so.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. COPD:  Patient was treated with IV steroids, Levaquin and
q.2h. nebulizer treatments while in the Intensive Care Unit,
and was maintained on BiPAP.  Unfortunately, the patient
would alternately take off his BiPAP, become more hypoxic,
and would require the BiPAP again.  This continued to be a
problem over a short stay in the MICU, and by the time he
absolutely refused to wear the BiPAP, he was sating in the
low 90s on nasal cannula.

Ultimately, the patient improved enough in order to be moved
to the floor.  This was hastened by the fact that the patient
was found smoking with oxygen on while in the Intensive Care
Unit requiring a sitter.  While on the General Medicine
floor, the patient continued to improve, and was changed over
to p.o. prednisone and was started on 60 of prednisone with
the idea to taper by 10 mg every three days.  He continued to
improve on the q.2h. nebulizers, and ultimately was changed
over to a Combivent inhaler which he took.  He continued to
increase his oxygen saturation and by discharge, had no
expiratory wheezes and was sating in the mid to high 90s on
no further oxygen.  He will be discharged with a slow
prednisone taper 10 mg every three days, and will continue
with his q.i.d. Combivent inhaler as well as Flovent MDI.

2. Bipolar disorder:  The patient's mental status continued
to be a problem during this hospitalization.  He was agitated
while in the Emergency Department, and this was difficult to
treat since giving him Ativan, tend to make him more
lethargic and more hypoxia.  His Zyprexa dose was initially
increased to 30 mg as well as continuing his valproic acid.
However, due to worsening mental status, the patient had a
psychiatric consult, who recommended lowering the Zyprexa to
25 mg and increasing prn Haldol.  He ultimately required
standing Haldol with prn Haldol as well for his mental
status.  While he continued to be expansive in mood, by the
end of admission, he had improved and was more contracted in
thought.

Unfortunately, on the morning of transfer from the MICU to
the floor, he tried to get up and leave against medical
advice, requiring more attention and a sitter.  He was then
found trying to smoke while wearing oxygen.  He, according to
his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] very well on his previous
lithium, although it was discontinued due to toxic levels.
This will hopefully be recontinued and restarted at the
outside hospital.
