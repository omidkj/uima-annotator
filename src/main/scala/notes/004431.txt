Admission Date:  [**2123-12-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-1-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2085-3-7**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Medicine

ADDENDUM:  The patient is a 38 year old [**Country 4574**] male with
AIDS, left upper lobe aspergilloma and lower extremity
paraparesis, who was originally admitted on [**2123-10-26**] with fever and cough.  He was subsequently found to have
an left upper lobe aspergilloma which was initially treated
with amphotericin, which led to the patient having seizures.
He was then placed in a phenobarbital coma, which slowly
resolved and was started on itraconazole therapy.  Please
refer to the dictation summary dictated on [**2124-1-5**],
dictated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

1.  Neurologic:  On [**2123-12-29**], the patient began
complaining of dizziness.  He did not describe a room
spinning sensation.  He felt like his head was falling to the
side, but no particular side, consistently.  He did not
complain of new numbness, weakness or tingling.  He did not
complain of dysphagia, dysarthria, hearing changes, sense of
fullness in the ear or headache.  He had no focal deficits on
examination.

The patient was started on Meclizine and initially showed
improvement on that.  Approximately one week after the
Meclizine was started, the patient was changed to a lower
dose of Meclizine.  After that change, the patient began
experiencing dizziness again.  Subsequently, neurology was
consulted on hospital day number 75.  Neurology felt that the
patient's dizziness was likely multi-factorial.  The cause
was believed to be vestibular peripheral superimposed axial
and lower extremity weakness with prolonged immobility.

Additionally, multiple medications that the patient was
taking have been associated with dizziness, including the
patient's seizure medications.  Neurology recommended
checking a phenobarbital level.  On [**2124-1-9**], the
level was 23, which was in the therapeutic range.  Neurology
also recommended considering a magnetic resonance imaging
scan if the patient's dizziness did not resolve or worsened.
Additionally, they recommended discontinuing Reglan if the
patient's symptoms did not resolve and the Reglan was not
deemed necessary.  The patient did not have any further
seizures during this hospitalization.

2.  Infectious disease:  The issue of reverse transcript ACE
inhibitors was revisited within the last two weeks.  The case
was discussed with infectious disease, who have been
following the case.  At this time, they recommended holding
on adding reverse transcript ACE inhibitors.  The patient's
amylase level on [**2124-1-7**] was 306.  When the amylase
level returns to normal, the infectious disease service will
revisit the issue of reverse transcript ACE inhibitors.

The patient was started on protease inhibitors on [**2123-12-26**].  According to fetal distress, the patient may stay
on double protease inhibitor therapy for up to three months
before resistance occurs.  The plan is to revisit the issue
of reverse transcript ACE inhibitors once the patient's
amylase level is within normal limits.

On hospital day number 73, the patient developed a 1 to 2 cm
ulcer at the perineum.  It was mildly tender to palpation.
The patient was started on acyclovir.  This also was presumed
to be due to herpes simplex virus type II.

3.  Physical therapy and occupational therapy:  The patient
continued to improve over the course of the hospitalization.
On discharge, the patient was able to ambulate approximately
200 feet with a standard walker.  The patient's lower
extremity strength was continuing to improve each day.  The
patient was also able to climb several stairs.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will need to follow up with the
Infectious Disease Clinic in two to three weeks after
discharge (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**]).
