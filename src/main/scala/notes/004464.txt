Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Symptomatic bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
57 y/o w/ dilated cardiomyopathy, afib, alcoholic cirrhosis,
COPD, ESRD, presented from hemodialysis with shortness of
breath.  EMS was called and ECG showed wide complex bradycardia
w/ bifascicular block without p waves.  He denied chest pain.
.
In the ED labs were notable for K 6.5, HCO3 20 and lactate 2.3.
Heart rates were initially 30-40 bpm with SBP >100.  They gave
him 2gm calcium, atropine 1mg and glucagon 1mg without effect.
They then repeated calcium 2gm x2, with improvement in heart
rate to 70s.  SBP >100.  10 units of regular and 1 unit d50 also
given.  1L of NS was given.  The renal fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
there are plans to initiate urgent hemodialysis.  Vitals prior
to transfer were 71, 111/65 20 94% on RA, afebrile.  Access
includes 18 and 20G and tunneled line.
.
On arrival to the MICU, started on dialysis.

CXR [**10-16**]: Moderate pulmonary edema, which may be cardiogenic or
uremic in
etiology.

TTE [**10-17**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium
is markedly dilated. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function may be mildly depressed but views are
suboptimal for assessment of wall motion. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Probably at
least moderate (2+) eccentric aortic regurgitation is seen
(views suboptimal). The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2100-12-11**],
the aortic regurgitation is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 57 year old male with a history of dilated
cardiomyopathy, afib, alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD, ESRD, presented
from hemodialysis with SOB and symptomatic wide-complex
bradycardia from hyperkalemia.
.
#.severe hyperkalemia. Wide complex bradycardia with no P-waves.
He was at dialysis on the day of admission, but before dialysis
EM was called due to SOB and weakness.  The hyperkalemia is most
likely due to ESRD and poor dietary compliance, but other less
likely causes include MI and rhadomyolysis.  Was given insulin,
glucagon, D50 with improvement in the ED and transfered to the
MICU for urgent dialysis. Repeat potassium after dialysis was
5.0. The patient refused repeat EKG. Upon transfer to the floor,
K stable approximately 4 x 2 with plan for d/c to dialysis.
.
#. CKD. Unclear etiology, but possibly due to HTN and poor
compliance.  No h/o DM. Appeared fluid overloaded on exam and by
CXR. Underwent urgent HD on [**10-16**], and had HD again on [**10-17**].
Discharged to dialysis.
.
#.EKG changes: Likley related to hyperkalemia, also dig level
slightly elevated to 2.6.  Patient underwent urgent dialysis,
with improvement in potassium and cardiac rhythm.  Dig held. On
discharge digoxin was restarted at lower dose of 0.125 mg
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
.
#. Dilated cardiomyopathy: Unclear etiology. History of HTN and
non-compliance, and could be the etiology of ESRD.  TTE showed
possible mildly depressed LV systolic function, but views were
suboptimal.  Did show RV dilation with depressed free wall
contractility, RA and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**]. Patient has at least moderate
(2+) eccentric AR, which is new.  Given recent line infection at
OSH, would have some concern for prior vegetation leading to new
onset AR.  Patient afebrile, and blood cultures from admission
were pending upon call out.
.
#. h/o afib-on metoprolol: Held metoprolol in the setting of
bradycardia.  Also held amiodarone.  Plan to restart as BP will
allow, as patient required metoprolol, amiodarone, and digoxin
for very difficult to control Afib. Per nephrologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4883**], patient should be continued on digoxin, but at
decreased dose (3x/week rather than daily). On discharge
amiodarone was discontinued and metoprolol was continued. Also
started aspirin 81 mg daily.
.
#. COPD: Continue Advair, nebs prn.
