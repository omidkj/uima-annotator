History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 67M with a h/o PVD s/p s/p Aorto-Bifiem bypass,
bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass who was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**]
cardiology service.  He presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital [**2104-5-23**]
wit complaints of L foot pain and numbness.  Reportedly was seen
by a vascular surgeon there and was noted to be in SVT with BPs
in 90's. He was cardioverted, and post cardioversion he was
noted to have a new RBBB and ST elevations. He was taken
emergently to the cath lab which showed 3VD including a total
RCA occlusion and 90% LAD occlusion. No intervention was done;
and he was transfered here.
  He has been on a heparin gtt, but no recent interventions have
been performed on the leg.  CK's have been steadily rising.
Reportedly, outside vascular surgeon felt the leg was not
salvageable; their plan was to continue the cardiac work-up
prior to a AKA.

Past Medical History:
1. Tobacco Abuse - 1 to 1.5 PPD
2. Coronary Artery Disease, last MI [**2073**], no interventions
3. Peripheral Vascular Disease, s/p aorto [**Hospital1 **]-fem bypass, s/p
bilateral fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass (all @ [**Hospital6 **]- [**Doctor First Name **]

[**5-26**]: CXR - Opacification in the left lower lung accompanied by
marked leftward mediastinal shift reflects lower lobe collapse.
There may be a small left pleural effusion. Right lung shows
mild pulmonary edema. Heart is mildly to moderately enlarged. No
pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the SVC. ET tube tip at
the thoracic inlet between 4 and 5 cm from the carina is
acceptable with the chin elevated. Nasogastric tube is folded in
the stomach.

[**5-27**]: Cath - 1. Peripheral angiography performed via right
brachial 4
french retrograde access to the abdominal aorta. The abdominal
aorta
had previous aorto-bifem bypass with complete occlusion of the
left limb
of the graft. The right iliac limb of the aortobifem bypass was
patent
to the CFA. The previous CFA aneurysmal segment is nos s/p
surgical
repair and there was a noted "kink" in the mid-segment of the
repair.
There is flow to the fem-popliteal bypass on the right with
occlusion of
the native SFA and PFA noted. The fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] fills the native
popliteal but
with very slow flow and limited filling. There was evidence of
extensive, layered thrombus in the distal native popliteal and
in the
TPT extending into the PT. The PT is the only vessel runoff to
the foot
and had extremely sluggish flow noted.
Left leg: the graft is as noted above. There is no filling of
the native
CFA; only collaterals to the native PFA are noted.

[**5-28**]: Renal US - 1. No evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric
fluid collection. 2. Mildly elevated resistive indices
bilaterally, of indeterminant etiology.

[**5-29**]: RUQ US - 1. The liver demonstrates heterogeneous
echotexture with focal areas of increased echogenicity. This
appearance is compatible with fatty liver; however, other liver
disease and more advanced liver disease including
cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded.

2. The liver demonstrates normal portal, arterial, and hepatic
vein flow.

3. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.

[**6-11**]: CXR - 1. Right PICC terminating within the right atrium.
2. Interval improvement in interstitial edema with persistent
mild pulmonary edema.
3. Unchanged retrocardiac atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted initially to the cardiology the to the
surgery service for evaluation and treatment; she was
transferred from Caritas.  . She had a cardiac catheterization,
and subsequently went to the operating room with the vascular
service for and exploration of the right groin,  thrombectomy of
right limb aortobifemoral graft, resection of right femoral
artery pseudoaneurysm, interposition graft from aortobifemoral
graft to common,    femoral artery, Thrombectomy left limb
aortobifemoral graft, left above-knee amputation.  On [**5-27**], the
patient returned to the OR for a reexploration; for details,
please see operative note. The patient remained intubated and
sedated and returned to the CVICU for further care.



Neuro: The patient received a fentanyl drip initally with good
effect and adequate pain control. Sedation was adjusted
accordingly.  Post operatively, the patient was intermittently
confused and agitated; Haldol and other sedatives were given.
Sedation was weaned when appropriate.


CV:  On [**5-26**], the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization
with successful revascularization and stent placement.
Cardiology continued to follow throughout her admission.  Her
cardiac enzymes were cycled, revealing an acute MI on POD [**2-10**].

On POD [**9-17**], the patient had 2 episodes of asystole with
spontaneous recovery.  Presedex was stopped at that time.
Lopressor, and other cardiac medications were adjusted when
appropriate to maintain stable vital signs.

On [**6-8**], the patient had episodic bradycardia to the 40's.

The patient's metoprolol was dosed accordingly, and on
admission, the patient was receiving metoprolol 125 mg TID.

Pulmonary:  Post operatively, the patient remained intubated and
sedated.

By [**6-5**], thoracic surgery was consulted for trach/peg placement;
trach sutures were to remain in place until [**6-14**].


GI/GU/FEN:

Post operatively, the patient was made NPO with IVF.  Tube feeds
were started on POD [**3-11**] via DObhoff; nutrition was consulted for
tube feed recommendations.

Post operatively, the nephrology team was consulted for
recommendations for acute renal failure; the creatinine was 1.6.
 A renal ultrasound was performed; se
