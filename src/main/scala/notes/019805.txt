Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Shellfish

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
A 70yoF with recent influenza A infection complicated by ARDS,
now transferred from [**Hospital6 1597**] with pneumomediastinum
likely [**3-9**] tracheal perforation, and MRSA PNA and pseudomonas
UTI.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy
EGD
tracheosteomy
PEG


History of Present Illness:
A 70yoF who presented to [**Hospital6 **] in [**4-10**] with
lethargy and fevers, and was found to have influenza A.  Her
hospital course was complicated by ARDS.  She was treated with
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and then levofloxacin and vancomycin,
as well as a long course of steroids.  She was intubated, and
later trached for on-going respiratory support at pulmonary
rehab in [**Hospital1 **].  She went to rehab with a tracheostomy tube
and off ventilatory support, but returned after a short period
of time with lethargy, hypercarbic respiratory distress
requiring mechanical ventilation (trach was decannulated and
replaced with button, and ET tube was replaced), a new LLL PNA,
paroxysmal rapid AFib (hr 180s), diarrhea, and upon workup was
found to have a pneumomediastinum, upper esophageal dilatation,
and an LLL PNA and UTI.  She underwent bronchoscopy which was
apparently unremarkable, and was treated empirically with
vancomycin and ceftazidime for pneumonia, and flagyl (for
diarrhea).  Her course has been complicated by hypotension
requiring levophed and rapid AFib for which conversion was
attempted unsuccessfully with ibutilide.  Cultures revealed MRSA
PNA/bacteremia, and pseudomonas UTI, and treatment was initiated
with vancomycin and zosyn.


Past Medical History:
1. Influenza A in [**4-10**] complicated by ARDS eventually leading to
intubation, ventilatory support, and tracheostomy.
2. Remote history of pneumonia.
3. Status post left eye cataract surgery.

.
CT neck [**5-31**]: pending.
.
CXR: [**5-29**]: 1. Interval worsening of the consolidation in the
right lower lobe superimposed on bilateral chronic lung changes.
2. Slight interval improved appearance of the subcutaneous
emphysema and no clear visualization of the previously noted
pneumomediastinum.
.
TTE [**5-29**]: All cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] normal in size.  The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated.  LV systolic function is preserved with
an estimated EF of 60%.  RV systolic function is preserved.
Mitral leaflets are minimally thickened with mild MR.  There is
mild TR with moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Estimated PASP is
40 mmHg + CVP.  Minimal pericardial effusion as well as
significant pleural effusion is noted.  Compared to a prior
study dated [**2130-4-22**], the PA pressure is
now elevated.
.
CT chest [**5-30**]: 1. Interval decrease in the pneumomediastinum and
subcutaneous gas. 2. Overdistention of the endotracheal tube
balloon, which increases risk of tracheal injury. 3. Slight
increased air space consolidation in the superior segment of the
left lower lobe. 4. Nasogastric tube terminating in the distal
esophagus well above
the level of the diaphragm.
.
CT chest [**5-28**]: 1. Extensive pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous
emphysema on the left axillary and supraclavicular regions
without evidence of pneumothorax. 2. Extensive bilateral
alveolar opacities with small pleural effusions.
.
Blood cx [**5-27**]: MRSA.
Blood cx [**5-29**]: NGTD.
Urine cx [**5-27**]: Pseudomonas.
Sputum cx [**5-28**]: MRSA.
------------------
CT abdomen with contrast [**2130-6-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) Moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites without evidence of
acute intra- or retroperitoneal hematoma.
2) Bibasilar fibrosis and bronchiectasis with a small anterior
right basilar pneumothorax and small bilateral pleural
effusions.
3) Anasarca.
4) Dilated gallbladder with layering sludge/gallstones.
5) Scoliosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
70yoF with recent influenza A infection complicated by ARDS, now
with pneumomediastinum likely [**3-9**] tracheocutaneous fistula.
.
# pneumomediastinum: evidence for pneumomediastinum is that
respiratory symptoms (hypercarbic failure) and AF with RVR
became worse when ET tube was in higher position, and resolved
when ET tube was repositioned lower, presumably below the site
of a fistula.  A bronch at OSH revealed no defects in the
tracheal wall, and an esophageal gastrograffin study was
negative as well.  Patient was trach'd for respiratory distress.
 Multiple imaging studies did not reveal any pneumomediastinum.
Repeat EGD/Rigid bronchoscopy did not show any TE fistula.  The
tracheostomy site was revised and a new #8 Portex Per-fit tube
was placed.  Patient was continued on supportive ventilation.
.
#respiratory failure: Pt. recovering from ARDS, which occurred
in the setting of influenza A infection in [**4-10**], and also with
LLL MRSA PNA on arrival -finished full course of vanco.  Likely
will take some time to resolve full lung function.  Pt. has been
on a chronic vent previously.  Now pt. w/ new trach.  Pt's
respiratory status has not been improving much - difficult to
wean pt. Pt. has failed multiple attempts at weaning--tires out
quickly on pressure support, and had to be placed back on assist
control and be fully supported.  Sedation was weaned off, and
the patient was placed on PRN sedation/pain meds.  Patient's
ABGs remained great, inhalers were continued.  A PEG tube was
placed for enteral feeds.  Patient was maintained on full
respiratory support, breathing on AC, failed PSV multiple times.
 Patient is to be weaned off the vent at pulmonary rehab.
.
#Hct drop. Crit is stable at this point. No source has been
found- no hemolysis noted on lab work, CXR neg for bleeding into
mediastinum and no evidence of RP bleed on CT.  Stool guaiac was
negative.
.
# Afib: has been refractive to both medical and chemical
treatments.  likely occurring secondary to respiratory
decompensation, rapid AFib resolved when ET tube was advanced,
decreasing the tension pneumomediastinum.  Has not been a
problem ever since the pneumomediastinum/TE fistula issue has
been resolved.  Patient remained very well rate-controlled.
Responds to lopressor.  Heart rate to be re-assessed at rehab.
.
# ID: Pt. w/ icnreased WBC a few days ago, but was found to have
C. diff and is receiving flagyl for this.  Pt. continue to be
a
