HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 50-year-old female with
complaints of dyspnea on exertion, cough and increased
abdominal girth in [**2114-4-14**] was admitted with congestive
heart failure and new diabetes mellitus diagnosed at that
time.  Catheterization at that time also showed 3 plus mitral
regurgitation.  The patient was sent home and spent a time
controlling the diabetes mellitus.  She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on [**9-13**] with recommendations for a cardiac
[**Month (only) **] which showed an ejection fraction of 32 percent, global
hypokinesis, global LV hypokinesis and moderate mitral
regurgitation.  She was admitted on [**2114-11-14**] preop for her
mitral valve repair versus replacement.  Catheterization on
[**2114-4-20**] showed normal coronaries, a cardiac output of 3.4
and a cardiac index of 1.8.  Echocardiogram performed on
[**8-6**] showed a dilated LV, global LV, hypokinesis,
ejection fraction of 15-20 percent, 2 plus TR and 3 plus MR.
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] performed [**2114-9-19**] showed an LV ejection
fraction of 32 percent, global LVHK and moderate MR.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in [**Location (un) **] with
family and friends in the area.  She had no tobacco history
and does not use alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is 5 feet, 5 inches tall weighing
155 pounds.  Her vital signs were 98.6.  Blood
pressure 105/60.  Sinus rhythm 83.  Respiratory rate 20
sating 96 percent on room air.
The patient was walking around the floor and was now lying in
bed with no apparent
distress.  For examination, she was alert and oriented times
three and appropriate and
was neurologically grossly intact.  Her lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was regular in rate and
rhythm with S1 and S2 tones and a grade 3/6 systolic ejection
murmur heard best at the apex of the heart.  Her abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended and round with positive bowel
sounds.  Her extremities were warm and well perfused without
any edema or varicosities.  Her pulses were 2 plus radially,
2 plus dorsalis pedis and 2 plus posterior tibial pulses.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 11832**] was to have her valve replaced with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
and continue her medications for her congestive heart failure
including intravenous Lasix and the following morning for a
preop diuresis.  The patient was being followed also by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], her heart failure cardiology specialist, who
consulted on the management of her congestive heart failure
preoperatively.  The patient continues to be managed by
Humalog and NPH, and [**Last Name (un) **] consultation was requested to
follow the patient while in house as the patient was known to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2866**].  The patient was also continued on her Effexor
for her depression.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  Sodium 142.  Potassium 4.2.
Chloride 102.  Bicarb 31.  BUN 28.  Creatinine 0.8 with a
blood sugar of 112.  White count 8.  Hematocrit 35.1.
Platelet count 127,000.  PT 13.  PTT 25.2.  INR 1.1.  ALT 23.
AST 22.  Alkaline phosphatase 79.  LDH 182.  Total bilirubin
0.2.  Amylase 112.  Albumin 4.5.

The patient remained on the floor preoperatively for her
heart failure workup and evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for question
of an ejection fraction of 15 percent.  The patient was seen
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**11-25**], and her recommendations
were appreciated.  Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 449**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2031**] of heart failure
service, cardiology, was also to consult on the patient in
the absence of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

On[**Last Name (STitle) **] day three in her preoperative period, her
examination was unremarkable.  She continued to receive Lasix
diuresis and had management of her sugars.  On [**11-16**],
she underwent mitral valve repair with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 405**] 26 mm
annuloplasty bands by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  She was transferred
to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition.

On postoperative day one, she was extubated.  Her Levophed
was turned off.  She remained on an epinephrine drip at 0.01
mcg/kg per minute and on an insulin drip at 5 units an hour.
Postoperative labs were as follows:  white count 16.4,
hematocrit 31.0, platelet count 104,000, potassium 4.6, BUN
16, creatinine 0.6 with a blood sugar of 136.  She was in
sinus rhythm at 91 with a blood pressure of 115/64 and
appeared to be hemodynamically stable at that time.  The
patient was also started on Natrecor.

On postoperative day two, the patient was on Natrecor at
0.01, Neo-Synephrine at 0.35 and epinephrine at 0.01.  Lasix
was being given at 20 mg b.i.d.  She was also started on
Aldactone orally.  White count rose slightly to 19.9.
Hematocrit dropped slightly to 26.6.  Creatinine remained
stable at 0.5.  She continued to require a fair amount of
support.  Her epinephrine was weaned down during the day.
The patient was started on beta blockade.  Chest tube was
removed.  The patient did have some nausea and vomiting,
which caused her heart rate to decrease to the 60s and had
some PACs.  The Levophed was weaned to off, and the
epinephrine was decreased and remained at 0.01 mg/kg/minute.
The patient was seen by cardiology, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**].

On postoperative day three, the patient was given some Dionex
the night earlier and was weaned off of her drip.  Her Swan
and chest tubes were out.  She was transfused one unit of
blood which brought her hematocrit up to 30.4.  She did have
an episode where her blood pressure had dropped, and Neo-
Synephrine was restarted.  Natrecor remained on.  Creatinine
remained stable.  White count rose to 23.1 from 19.9 on
postoperative day three.

On postoperative day four, she was offered Neo-Synephrine
drip and was taking her aspirin, Lasix and spironolactone to
continue with diuresis.  Pulmonary toilet was encouraged.
Foley was discontinued.  Arterial and central venous lines
were also discontinued.  Carvedilol was started per
cardiology recommendations, and the patient was transferred
out to the floor.  The patient restarted her digoxin load at
0.25 mg and then to be decreased to 0.125 mg p.o. daily, her
original preoperative dose, with a plan to start her
Carvedilol again if her rhythm would tolerate it.  The
patient continue to be alert and oriented.  Physical therapy
consultation was requested for the patient as soon as she was
able to get out of the unit, and she was transferred out to
floor two on [**2114-11-21**], postoperative day five.

It was difficult to motivate the patient, but this continued
to be worked on by the staff to encourage her to start
ambulating and be involved in her care.  She was encouraged
to continue with good pulmonary toilet.  Her digoxin level
was low on the 9th, and she was given an additional 0.125 on
the 9th to help boost her digoxin level.  She had some
incisional pain, but was medicated with Tylenol and was
receiving relief from the Tylenol.

On postoperative day six, she continued all of her o
