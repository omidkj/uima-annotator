Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76yo F with no prior medical history who presented
with nausea/vomiting/epigastric pain since Sunday night. Patient
states that she had severe pain since [**4-8**] and went to the
hospital because of dizziness and intractable nausea/vomiting.
She tried Tylenol at home with 9/10 epigastric pain and took
baby [**Month/Day (4) **]. [**Name2 (NI) **] went to [**Hospital3 3583**] at 4:20AM with 6mm STE
in 2, 3, AVF and ST depression in 1, L, V1-V3 and STE V5-V6. She
was started on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], plavix, zofran, IVNTG, lopressor,
heparin gtt and 1L NS. She was transferrd here for cardiac
catheterization.

In cath lab, she was found to have 100% RCA proximal lesion
which was stented and temporary pacer placed for complete heart
block  during the procedure. IABP was placed for decreased CI.
Atropine was given multiple times as well as nitroprusside,
diltiazem and adenosine intracoronary. [**First Name3 (LF) **] was continued.
Patient is awake and does not complain of chest pain/N/V/SOB
upon arrival to CCU.

Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:

LAD-60% proximal, 90% complex mid involving D2 with 90% prox and
70%med
D1+60%
LCx-90% major OM1

Successful stenting of the mid and proximal RCA with two
overlapping
bare metal stents (a 3.5x38mm Zeta distally and a 3.5x33mm
Hepacoat
proximally which was postdilated to 4.0mm). Significant no
reflow was
treated with very large dosed of IC vasodilators with fair
results

PCWP28 RA28 CO./CI 2.07/1.28
PA 36/25 30

echo:
EF25%; Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior
and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments are mildly
hypokinetic. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis (apical
function is somewhat better preserved). Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


EKG:LAD, [**Apartment Address(1) **], 3, AVF(3>2), STE V4R, STD 1 and AVL, STE V5-V6
with TWI, 2nd degree type I

KUB [**4-15**]:
PORTABLE ABDOMEN: The exam is suboptimal secondary to patient
positioning.
Only the upper abdomen is included within the imaged plane. Gas
is seen
extending throughout multiple loops of small and large bowel.
The transverse
colon measures upper limits of normal at 4.8. There is no acute
evidence of
obstruction, with no air-fluid levels identified. The
surrounding soft
tissues reveal clear lung bases.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study. Transverse colon measures upper
limits of
normal with no air-fluid levels to indicate acute obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76yo F with no prior medical history who presented
with ST elevation myocardial infarction, inferior MI and RV
infarct. During this admission, she was found to have 3 vessel
disease with 100% RCA occlusion . She underwent cardiac
catheterization on  [**2183-4-9**] and had baremetal stent/hepacoat
stents to RCA.

On arrival to the CCU, she had acute respiratory acidosis
probably due to excessive sedation. She was intubated for 2 days
and was extubated on [**4-11**] without complication. Her CVP was kept
in the range of 13-15mmHg to maintain her preload given the RV
involvement. Her cardiac index gradually improved and she was
weaned off IABP and pressors on [**4-12**] without complication.
Echocardiogram was done on [**4-10**] for concern of VSD given high
mixed venous.It was negative for VSD/ASD and showed EF of 30%,
akinesis of inferior septum and inferior free wall, severe
hypokinesis of posterior wall, no AS, no AI, 1+MR. As her RV
recovers, she no longer needed the high CVP and was diuresed
easily with lasix.

Patient had complete heart block and then 2nd degree type II
block while in the cath lab. Temporary pacing wire was placed
and was then removed in the CCU. She remained in 1st degree
heart block throughout her stay with premature atrial beats
occasionally. On [**2183-4-14**], she went into atrial fibrillation and
failed metoprolol and calcium channel blocker. She was DC
cardioverted back to NSR. Amiodarone was started and given that
she had an MI and was acutely ill, it was decided that she
should be kept on amiodarone for one month. Her TSH was normal.

While in the CCU, she developed bouts of diarrhea which turned
out to be C.diff negative. SHe also had a lot of gas and
belching which caused her to be nauseous. Her EKG was unchanged.
She became better after being out of bed. KUB was done which was
negative for perforation. lFTS and pancreatic enzymes were
normal

She also had acute platelet drop while on ballon pump and
heparin. Her HIT antibody was negative.

She has guiac positive stool while on anticoagulation in the
CCU. Her hematocrit remained stable and further work up was
deferred to outpatient management. She should have follow up
with her PCP for this.

Of note, she also completed 7 days course of oxacillin for MSSA
in her sputum while she spiked a fever in the CCU

She was continued on aspirin, plavix, lisinorpil, lipitor and
toprol. SInce she has residual disease of her coronaries, she
may require CABG in the near future. Cardiac surgery was
consulted and she will be followed as outpatient in 2 weeks.
