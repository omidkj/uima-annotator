.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2176-12-3**] 10:09 AM
No radiographic evidence of bowel obstruction. Given the paucity
of gas within the small bowel and distal large bowel and
[**Hospital 228**] medical history, can consider CT examination if high
clinical suspicion.
.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2176-12-3**] 3:19 PM:
1. Marked wall edema involving loops of jejunum and proximal
ileum with proximal and distal transition points, mesenteric
engorgement, and rotation/"swirling" of the mesentery all
suggestive of an internal hernia with vascular compromise. No
bowel obstruction at this time though finding are concerning for
impending closed loop obstruction

2. No significant interval change to the amount of
intra-abdominal and intrapelvic ascites. Worsening peritoneal
disease evidences by growing left paracolic nodule.

3. Stable sarcoidosis of the lung and necrotic/ calcified
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

4. Unchanged hypoattenuating hepatic and renal lesions, some of
which are too small to characterize and some of which are simple
cysts. Stable inguinal lymphadenopathy.
.
PATHOLOGY [**2176-12-6**] Subcutaneous nodule, excision:
1.  Skin and superficial subcutis with foreign body giant cell
reaction and fat necrosis with focal calcification.
2.  No carcinoma is seen.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2176-12-9**] 12:11 PM
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Severe
infiltrative process, likely secondary to chronic sarcoidosis,
is not changed.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2176-12-9**]  10:31:38 AM
Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Compared with prior tracing of
[**2175-10-26**]
no major change is evident.


Brief Hospital Course:
Medical Service:She was initially admitted to the medical
service for managment with NPO status, IVF, bowel rest, and pain
management. Dr.[**Name (NI) 1863**] [**Name (STitle) **] Surgery service was
consulted. At that point, it appeared she would require surgical
reduction of the hernia & lysis of adhesions. She was consented
and prepped for the OR.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 97994**] operative course was uncomplicated. She was
routinely observed in the PACU, and transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for
post-op care.
.
VOLUME STATUS: Post-operative marginal urine output, which
responded to fluid boluses. Due to her compromised respiratory &
cardiac function, she had difficulty processing the additional
intravascular fluid. She was found to be lethargic at the
bedside on POD1, somewhat responsive to stimuli, but unable to
answer questions. An ABG was collected revealing respiratory
acidosis. She was immediately transferred to the ICU for
ventilatory support. She was intubated for a day, and extubated
successfully once her respiratory status returned to baseline.
In addition, she was aggressively diuresed with adequate
response.
.
RESP/Sarcoidosis:She uses 2 liters of oxygen at home at
baseline. Her home regimen includes Hydroxychloroquine &
Sildenafil for management of her sarcoidosis. Her pulmonar
hypertension is well controlled with Nifedipine & Atenolol. She
was able to wean to her baseline oxygen requirement, and resumed
on all her home medications. She continues to be tachypneic
which is also her baseline, RR-24-30. She was evaluated per
Physical Therapy. She will be discharged home with PT for
further strenghtening & respiratory re-conditioning.
.
ABD: Her incision is closed with staples and OTA. She had an
unremarkable postoperative course in regards to her abdomen.
.
NUT:She was NPO post-op. She remained NPO post-op while
