HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 50010**] is an 80 year-old
male with a past medical history significant for alcoholic
cirrhosis, gastric and esophageal varices and recurrent
gastrointestinal bleed who presented to the [**Hospital 40262**] Hospital
with syncopal episodes after a gastrointestinal bleed.  His
son reports that he was in his usual state of health until
one week prior to admission when he complained of back pain,
decreased appetite, and decreased po intake and sleep.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 50010**] reports having brown stools and denies any tarry
black or malonic stools.  He does report vomiting times two
with bloody clots several days prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 1444**], and he states he passed out
while on the toilet after passing malonic stools.  This
episodes was not witnessed.  Mr. [**Known lastname 50010**] reports that he does
not remember the event.  He sustained trauma with a skin tear
at the left elbow and multiple rib fractures as seen on chest
CT on the left involving ribs 5 through 7 with disc
displacement in segments and pockets of air along the chest
wall consistent with subcutaneous air and a small left
pleural effusion.  There was no pneumothorax noted.  He
denied and had no evidence of head trauma.  His wife reported
that she heard the fall and brought him to the [**Hospital 40262**]
Hospital Emergency Department on [**10-16**].  At Falmuth vital
signs revealed a heart rate of 133 and a blood pressure of
84/41. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells and
hydration with normal saline.  He had an elevated white blood
cell count at that point at 18.4 and a hematocrit of 30 that
fell to 29.  His creatinine was 1.6 and fell to 1.3 after
hydration.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy at [**Hospital 40262**] Hospital
showed blood in the stomach, but no active bleed and there
was a noted large varices in the gastric fundus and grade one
varix in the lower esophagus with no stigmata of recent
hemorrhage.  He was started on an Octreotide drip and
Protonix and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for evaluation of TIPS procedure.  At the time of
transfer his hematocrit was stable at 29.

Of note, he had a similar hospitalization at [**Hospital 40262**] Hospital
on [**2164-9-19**] for an episode of gastrointestinal bleed with
malonic stools after he self discontinued his Prevacid,
because of increased diarrhea.  He received 4 units of packed
red blood cells at this time and EG showed a submucosal
fundal mass with a differential diagnosis including stromal
tumor versus gastric fundal varix.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy two weeks later at [**Hospital1 346**] revealed gastric fundal varices,
probable chronic pancreatitis and perigastric varices.  He
was treated with nonselected beta blockers at this time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed a
temperature of 98.6, heart rate of 76, blood pressure 142/76,
respirations 18, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.
In general he was an overweight male appearing younger then
stated age lying in bed.  He was alert and oriented times two
and was using a morphine PCA with limited movement.  On HEENT
examination his sclera had evidence of slight icterus.  His
pupils were constricted, but were equally round and reactive
to light.  His extraocular movements intact.  He had rosacea
noted on his nose.  His oropharynx was clear with dry mucous
membranes.  His neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly.  Examination of his chest revealed bruising over
the left axilla with tenderness to palpation.  He had
crackles two thirds of the way anteriorly on the left side by
auscultation.  He had crepitus at the left apex one third of
the way down on palpation.  His heart was regular, and there
was evidence of a 2 out of 6 systolic crescendo decrescendo
ejection murmur at the base radiating to the left carotids.
He also had 2 out of 6 holosystolic murmur at the apex with
radiation to the axilla.  His abdomen was firm and distended,
yet nontender to palpation.  He had good bowel sounds.  He
had no fluid wave or ascites.  He had no hepatosplenomegaly
to percussion.  Examination of his extremities revealed no
evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Extremities were
warm and well perfuse.  He had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Examination of his skin revealed palmar
erythema bilaterally.  He had ecchymosis of his upper
extremities noted from his hand to his elbows bilaterally.
He had a left skin tear on his elbow on the left wrapped with
gauze.  He had telangiectasias noted on his face and
extremities.  There was also evidence of cherry angiomas on
the upper thorax.  On neurological examination he was alert
and oriented times three.  He knew he was in the hospital,
but not which hospital it was.  He had no asterixics noted in
his right hand and was not able to extend his left hand due
to pain.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC revealed a white blood cell
count of 14, hematocrit 28.2, platelets 124.  He had a PT of
13.2, PTT of 25.6.  Chemistries revealed a sodium of 141,
potassium of 3.9, chloride 90, bicarb 25, BUN 46, creatinine
0.8 and glucose 145.  He had a calcium of 8.4, magnesium of
1.9 and phos of 3.0.  His albumin was 2.8.  Liver function
tests revealed an AST of 26, ALT of 20, T bili 1.0, amylase
29, LDH 225, alkaline phosphatase of 108.  He had an
electrocardiogram on admission, which showed a normal sinus
rhythm with a rate of 95.  He had a normal axis and normal
QRS intervals.  There was no evidence of ST or T wave
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed:  Mr.
[**Known lastname 50010**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] status post upper gastrointestinal bleed for
evaluation of TIPS for decompression of portal hypertension
and esophageal varix.  He was hemodynamically stable upon
admission.  His hematocrit and coags were followed.  He only
required 1 unit of packed red blood cells while admitted and
from that time his hematocrit remained in the 28 to 30 range.
He was started on Octreotide and Protonix drip.  He had an
abdominal ultrasound to evaluate his portal vein anatomy and
then underwent TIPS the following day.  The procedure was
uneventful, however, ultrasound after the procedure revealed
occlusion of the TIPS and questionable flow within the portal
vein.  Status post the TIPS procedure his liver function
tests began to rise and then slowly trended down over the
next several days.  On [**10-20**] he went for revision of his TIPS
with extension of the stent in both directions, and coiling
of several gastric varices by interventional radiology.  This
procedure was also uneventful and ultrasound after the TIPS
revision revealed patent flow within the portal vein and
TIPS.  H
