Admission Date:  [**2183-7-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2183-7-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2111-6-23**]       Sex:  M

Service:  INT MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
African American male with multiple recent admissions for
urinary tract infection, a history of cerebrovascular
accident and an indwelling suprapubic catheter, who was
transferred from the [**Hospital3 6560**] Facility for shortness
of breath and decreased oxygen saturation to 76% on room air.
He had several days of congestion, with copious secretions on
the morning of admission.  He was also found to be
tachycardic.

At the nursing home, the patient was suctioned and placed on
three liters by nasal cannula with oxygen saturations
increasing to 80%.  The patient had a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube in place and did not take anything by mouth.
He was nonverbal at baseline and recently moved to [**Location (un) 86**]
from [**State 19827**].

In the emergency room, the patient was found to be febrile to
101.9??????F with a pulse of 120 and sinus tachycardia.  The
patient was found to have a urinalysis suggestive of a
urinary tract infection in addition to decreased oxygen
saturations and a streaky left lower lobe opacity suggestive
of an infiltrate.  The patient was given levofloxacin and
ceftriaxone with intravenous fluids in the emergency room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
2.  Admission for urinary retention secondary to urethral
stricture.
3.  Elevated PSA.
4.  Cerebrovascular accidents, multiple, in the past.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Suprapubic tube indwelling.
7.  Gastrojejunostomy tube.
8.  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium
difficile urosepsis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d.
Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d.
Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
Ritalin 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient moved from [**State 19827**] to [**Location (un) 86**]
earlier this year.  He lived at the Bostonian.  He had two
daughters, [**Name (NI) 2048**] [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 34244**]) and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 34245**]), who were intimately involved in his care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
had a temperature of 101.9??????F with a pulse of 140, sinus
tachycardia and a blood pressure of 101/72.  His oxygen
saturation was 96% on four liters and 87% on room air at the
time of admission; however, by the time we saw the patient,
he was 95% on room air.  Generally, he was a nonverbal,
contracted, elderly male lying in bed in no acute distress.
On HEENT examination, the head was normocephalic and
atraumatic.  The mucous membranes were mildly dry.

The lungs had coarse breath sounds at the left base by the
report of the emergency department.  It was difficult to
interpret on my examination due to decreased effort.  The
heart was tachycardic with no murmurs, rubs or gallops
appreciated.  The abdomen had a gastrojejunostomy tube and a
suprapubic tube with thin, yellow liquid at the entry site.
He had a soft abdomen.  On skin examination, the patient had
a decubitus ulcer that was 5 cm deep with granulation tissue
clear around the borders.  The extremities were thin and
contracted.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission, the patient had a
white blood cell count of 12,700 with a hematocrit of 39.
There was a sodium of 141, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 102,
bicarbonate of 26, BUN of 25, creatinine of 0.6 and glucose
of 131.  Urinalysis showed large blood and was nitrite
positive with greater than 300 protein, 88 white blood cells
and occasional bacteria.  The patient had cultures pending.

RADIOLOGY:  The chest x-ray showed a left lower lobe
infiltrate.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The electrocardiogram was terminis with a
poor baseline.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted with a
urinary tract infection and left lower lobe pneumonia.  His
previous urinary tract infection had become systemic and the
patient had Escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin,
ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, levofloxacin and Bactrim on
[**2183-5-4**], in addition to Enterococcus sensitive to
ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin.  These were both found
in the blood and were thought to be spread from an initial
urinary tract infection.

Given the multiple resistant organisms, the patient was
started on Flagyl to cover possible anaerobes in the left
lower lobe infiltrate, ceftriaxone to cover the previously
resistant Escherichia coli and vancomycin to cover for a
history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the
urine.  At the time of this Discharge Summary, the patient is
growing Staphylococcus coagulase positive out of his urine;
however, the final sensitivities are still pending.

The patient did well throughout his hospitalization.  He was
stable with a decreasing oxygen requirement.  He was on two
liters of oxygen at the time of discharge with an oxygen
saturation of 99-100%.  He was nonverbal, so it was difficult
to assess how he was feeling; however, he continued to have a
soft abdomen and a benign examination.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a history of
hypertension, however he was in sinus tachycardia in the
setting of being volume depleted at the time of admission.
We held his atenolol during this admission; this will be
started back up as the patient is discharged and gets back to
his baseline.

3.  FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
placed on high protein tube feedings at 75 cc/h with some
vitamin supplements.  He was also placed on half normal
saline at 100 cc/h after completing three liters of normal
saline.  The patient's heart rate came down after the volume
resuscitation.  He was placed on all of his outpatient
medications in addition to subcutaneous heparin as deep vein
thrombosis prophylaxis.

4.  CODE STATUS:  The patient is a full code per a
conversation with his daughter on [**2183-7-3**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Urinary tract infection.
Pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Zantac 150 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
2.  Tube feedings at 75 cc/h.
3.  Flagyl 500 mg per gastrostomy tube t.i.d. for a total of
14 days with the last day on [**2183-7-16**]; further antibiotics
will be indicated in Page 1, given the sensitivities of the
final organisms.
4.  Proscar 5 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg per gastrostomy tube q.d.
6.  Colace 100 mg per gastrostomy tube b.i.d.
7.  Dulcolax p.r.n.
8.  Atenolol, which was on hold and was to be restarted as an
outpatient.
