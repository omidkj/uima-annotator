Date of Birth:   [**2083-10-9**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Company 191**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year old African
American female with a history of sickle cell disease, gout,
hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure and chronic
renal failure who was recently admitted [**2140-4-9**], to
[**2140-4-16**], with mental status changes and lethargy, which were
attributed to pain medicines with an element of uremia.  She
also developed diarrhea with negative stool cultures and
negative Clostridium difficile toxin times three.  She was
discharged home on [**2140-4-16**], and then had a follow-up
appointment in hematology clinic the day of admission with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She was noted to be febrile to 101 and reported
having fevers for the last few days.  She also reported
urinary frequency but no dysuria.  She complained of pain
over tophi of her bilateral elbows and redness.  She was
originally admitted to the [**Company 191**] service on the floor but she
was noted to have a diffuse back and abdominal pain and chest
pain.  She was given one liter of D5 normal saline, Ceptaz
and Magnesium, Tylenol and Morphine for pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for mild chronic shortness of
breath on home four liters oxygen, no cough, positive
diarrhea times two days, no nausea, vomiting, no bright red
blood per rectum, no melena, no dysuria, no frequency, no
sick contacts.  She sleeps with four pillows at baseline and
has had no changes in her weight recently.  There was concern
for acute chest given her sickle cell disease and then she
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Sickle cell disease, recent pain crisis and admission.
2.  Gout.
3.  History of poor response to blood transfusions secondary
to immune mediated hemolysis.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency with focal glomerulosclerosis
with a normal baseline creatinine of 3.0 to 4.0.
5.  History of increased ferritin with possible secondary to
hemochromatosis.
6.  Congestive heart failure with an echocardiogram on [**3-27**],
with an ejection fraction of greater than 55% and diastolic
dysfunction.
7.  Depression.
8.  Home oxygen, two liters.
9.  Hypertension.
10. Anemia.
11. Status post cholecystectomy.
12. Reactive airway disease.
13. Hepatomegaly on CT found on [**2140-4-1**], increased alkaline
phosphatase and GGT secondary to question of chronic
intrahepatic cholestasis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Celexa 20 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Albuterol one to two puffs q6hours p.r.n.
3.  Amlodipine 5 mg once daily.
4.  Folate 5 mg once daily.
5.  Silvamere 1600 three times a day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is retired and lives with her daughter.
[**Name (NI) **] tobacco and no alcohol and no intravenous drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 101.6, pulse
113, blood pressure 158/80, respiratory rate 24, oxygen
saturation 100% on four liters.  She appeared uncomfortable
and tired.  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact.  Mucous membranes are
moist.  No sinus tenderness.  The neck was supple with full
range of motion. She was tachycardic with a normal S1 and S2.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with no
wheezes or crackles.  Her abdomen was obese, positive bowel
sounds, diffusely tender, positive enlarged liver, 13
centimeter span, no spleen tip, no caput, no fluid ascites
appreciated.  She had no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  She had
positive warm and swollen left elbow.  Cranial nerves II
through XII are intact.  Strength is [**5-30**] throughout in all
four extremities.  No asterixis.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cells was 0.8, hematocrit 11.0,
platelet count 81,000.  Sodium 139, potassium 2.8, chloride
112, bicarbonate 15, blood urea nitrogen 69, creatinine 3.3,
glucose 121, ALT 22, AST 45, alkaline phosphatase 736, total
bilirubin 0.9, LDH 153, albumin 3.0, calcium 8.2, magnesium
1.3, phosphate 4.0, uric acid 7.9.  Reticulocyte count was
pending.  ANC was 130.  Hepatoglobin 155.  Fibrinogen 571.

Chest x-ray demonstrated improvement from prior chest x-ray
on [**2140-4-15**], with a decreased pleural effusion, no focal
infiltrative process, but positive cardiomegaly.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the unit with concern
for acute chest, however, given her febrile neutropenia, she
was placed on Ceftazidime which was renally dosed.  She
remained febrile until [**2140-5-8**], three days into admission.
It was thought that there was a possibility of septic
arthritis.  Her left elbow was tapped.  The second tap
revealed 220,000 white blood cells, 792,500 red blood cells
of which the differential was 92% polys, 3% lymphocytes and
4% monocytes.  They were unable to aspirate much from the
joint given the high prevalence of gout crystals. However,
her elbow decreased in size and clinically began to improve.
She did remain afebrile.  Additionally, blood cultures also
came back positive for MSSA for which she was changed to
Oxacillin on [**2140-5-9**].

Pancytopenia - This was thought to be secondary to
Hydroxyurea, the dose of which had been escalated recently.
This medication was discontinued and her count began to
slowly improve.

Acute renal failure - She had chronic renal insufficiency.
On admission, her creatinine was 3.3, however, after
aggressive diuresis in the Intensive Care Unit, her
creatinine bumped to as high as 6.7.  Renal consultation was
obtained and felt that this was secondary to hypoperfusion
from the diuresis and her creatinine slowly began to recover
and was 4.5 at discharge.  The renal team following thought
that she would eventually need hemodialysis and was to set
her up for an outpatient port after discharge.

Pulmonary - The patient had chronic lung disease on home
oxygen, however, chest CT demonstrated multiple infarcts
thought to be secondary to sickle disease.  She was also
found to have pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram.  The
etiology of this was also likely to sickle cell disease.  She
was set up with an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from
pulmonary to further evaluate this.

Cardiac - The patient has a tendency to easily go into
congestive heart failure.  She is on Lasix at home.  Because
of her mild chest pain shortness of breath on admission, she
was ruled out by enzymes on [**2140-5-6**].  The Lasix was
initially held secondary to renal failure.  An echocardiogram
on [**2140-5-9**], demonstrated an ejection fraction of 70%,
moderate pulmonary hypertension, left atrial dilatation, left
ventricular hypertrophy, 1+ mitral regurgitation, 2+
tricuspid regurgitation, and her fluid status remained
stable.

Additionally, she had an episode of atrial fibrillation while
in the Intensive Care Unit with rapid ventricular response.
This was responsive to Diltiazem and she remained in normal
sinus rhythm at discharge.

Gastrointestinal - The patient complained of right upper
quadrant chronic abdominal pain. It was thought this was
secondary to iron overload and hemochromatosis.  She had
previously been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] during a
previous hospitalization.  Therefore, she was set up with an
outpatient appointment to evaluate this for possible biopsy
and kelation therapy.

Gout - It was thought that the left elbow swelling and pain
was secondary to gout, however, she was unable to be
medicated for this as the pancytopenia prohibited her from
Hydroxyurea and Colchicine.  There was a question of septic
arthritis.  Therefore, Prinivil was also not begun.  However,
orthopedic consultation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle)
