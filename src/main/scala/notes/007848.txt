hormone was 0.47.  ALT was 271, AST was 158, LDH was 791,
alkaline phosphatase was 165, amylase was 33, total bilirubin
was 0.3, lipase was 19, and albumin was 3.  Creatine kinases
were 495, 268, and 221.  CK/MB fractions were 10, 6, and 6.
Troponin I levels were 1, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.3.  Arterial blood
gas revealed pH was 7.26, PCO2 was 69, PO2 was 58.  A sputum
Gram stain and culture revealed 1+ gram-positive cocci in
pairs, greater than 25 polymorphonuclear neutrophils, less
than 10 epithelial cells.  Culture with sparse growth of
oropharyngeal flora.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING FINDINGS:  An abdominal x-ray revealed
nonspecific bowel gas pattern.

A chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, vessel congestion,
bullous changes stable.  No pneumothorax.

A computed tomography angiogram of the chest on [**2196-3-7**] revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism,
cardiomegaly, small-to-moderate pericardial effusion, severe
emphysema, new right middle lobe collapse, right hilar
lymphadenopathy, and multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules.

Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm, left
ventricular hypertrophy, with lateral ST-T wave changes.

Pulmonary function tests from [**2194-7-21**] revealed FEV1 was
36%, forced vital capacity was 44%, and FEV1:FVC was 83%.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 46-year-old female with
severe lung disease complaining of shortness of breath.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ISSUES:  The patient arrived
from the Emergency Room to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on
[**2196-3-8**] and was given albuterol nebulizers.  The
patient was then placed on mask ventilation with positive
end-airway pressure of 5 and PSV at 40% with ventilation of
400 cc, and a respiratory rate of 20.

The patient also ruled out for a myocardial infarction with
cardiac enzymes.  The patient was overly sedated due to being
restarted on psychiatric medications and was reversed with
midazolam during rounds.  An arterial blood gas showed a pH
of 7.15, with a CO2 in the 90s.  After the midazolam was
given, the arterial blood gas improved with a pH of 7.26.  Her
respiratory status worsened and she was intubated.

On [**2196-3-9**], the patient was noted to have a right
pneumothorax that had likely developed on the ventilator.  She
had a right chest tube placed in the seventh intercostal space on
Pleurovac suction after a chest x-ray showed a right basilar
pneumothorax.  She was also started on Ultracal for nutrition,
and azithromycin was also started.

On [**2196-3-11**], the patient was extubated without incident,
and tolerated oral intake, and was called to the floor.

2.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient had a 7-day course of
azithromycin for presumed pneumonia and completed a shortened
prednisone taper for a presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare.

The patient continued to use inhalers, nebulizers, and
supplemental oxygen as needed and by discharge was at
baseline.  Pulmonary Service decided to continued the workup
of the new pulmonary nodules viewed on computed tomography as
an outpatient.  She will need a CT of the chest to view the
status of these nodules and followup with pulmonary.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  A repeat chest x-ray and
transthoracic echocardiogram performed after the patient was
called to the floor showed no significant changes from
before; cardiomegaly, no effusions, bullous changes within
both upper lung lobes, and a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 30% to 35%, mild mitral regurgitation, and a
small pericardial effusion.

The lisinopril dose was increased to 10 mg p.o. q.d., and
diltiazem was discontinued.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL/FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:
The patient had evaluated liver enzymes on admission.  A
hepatitis panel showed that the patient was hepatitis B
surface antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, and hepatitis C antibody negative.

The patient reported a bout of hepatitis five to six years
ago that subsequently led to significant weight loss from a
previous weight of 180 pounds and a series of nervous
breakdowns.

The patient appeared cachectic.  Nutrition Service was
consulted, and the patient was placed on a diabetic
sodium-restricted diet, daily multivitamin, and nutrition
shakes with meals.

The patient was continued on lansoprazole for
gastroesophageal reflux disease and bisacodyl and Docusate
for constipation.

5.  ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient has type 2 diabetes.  The
patient was placed on insulin during this admission and had a
diabetic teaching nurse come by twice.  However, due to
worries about the patient's understanding and compliance with
an insulin regimen treatment, the patient was placed on
Glyburide 2.5 mg instead.

6.  RENAL SYSTEM:  During admission, the patient had a
copious discharge of urine and was felt to likely have
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
