Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
 chest pain, bradyarrhythmia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placement on [**2158-6-16**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old Portugese speaking man with PMH
significant for CAD (no stents, cath), emphysema s/p lobectomy
on 2.5L home O2, alzheimer's disease who was transferred from
LGH to [**Hospital1 18**] for chest pain and bradyarrhythmia.
.
Patient is a poor historian given underlying dementia and son is
not aware of complete medical history.  Per son, patient went to
his PCP approximately several days ago with complaints of chest
pain and back pain.  In clinic his HR was in the 30s.  At that
time he was also noted to be more forgetful and it was suspected
that he has underlying alzeihmer's dementia.  He was started on
medication for his alzheimers, otherwise no changes made to his
medications.  His chest pain is described as sharp in the
sternal area as well as upper abdominal area.  He also had back
pain.  Per his son, he thought his breathing was worse.  Patient
has also had worsening dizziness.  He has had dizziness for over
a year, thought to be "vertigo."  It is unclear if his heart
rate has been low in the past, since he has not seen a physician
in some time.  His family does think that his dizziness has
gotten worse, and that patient is more unsteady though he has
not fallen or syncopized.
.
He represented to LGH ED with similar complaints of CP, back
pain.  An ECG was concerning for Mobitz II vs complete.  He got
CTA that was concerning for widened mediastinum.  He received
aspirin, lasix, and fentanyl.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were  98.0 34 139/53 16 100% on ??.
He was hemodynamically stable.  He had no infectious symptoms.
His HR was persistently in the 30s.  An ECG showed Mobitz II and
CHB.  His CT was reviewed with radiology who did not think there
was dissection, but a recess of the pericardium.  His labs in
the ED were notable for troponins of 0.34, leukocytosis 14.3.
He did not receive heparin.  Pacer pads were placed.  His vitals
on transfer were: 95% 2L, 123/47, 34.  He has 2 piv's in place.
.
Currently, he denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or
dizziness.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2158-6-16**] Echo:
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the distal septum, anterior, and
inferior walls and apex. The mid anterior septum and anterior
walls are hypokinetic. . The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 35 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution).
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

IMPRESSION:
1)Multiple pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes in
the right hilum and subcarinal region are indeterminate and may
be reactive due to resolving consolidation in the right lower
lobe


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old Portugese speaking man with PMH significant for CAD
(no stents, cath), emphysema s/p lobectomy, alzheimer's disease
transferred from LGH to [**Hospital1 18**] for complete heart block.
.
# Symptomatic Bradyarrhythmia: ECG notable for complete heart
block, ventricular escape beat.  He received 1.5mg atropine
without improvement in heart rate (still CHB).  A TV pacer was
placed and patient was taken for PPM placement the subsequent
day. Patient will follow up with EP as an outpatient.
.
# Lymphadenopathy: CT showed prominent lymphadenopathy noted in
chest w/ recommendation for repeat CT chest in 3 months.
.
# CAD/NSTEMI: Troponins positive at 0.34, but MB flat.  Patient
was started on aspirin and lipitor.
.
# Emphysema: On home O2.  Patient is status post lobectomy and
has a significant smoking history.  O2 sats were stable prior to
discharge.
.
# ? Lung Cancer: Per son patient recently diagnosed with lung
cancer, without any planned intervention given his significant
emphysema and underlying lung disease.  Currently, without any
constitutional symptoms such as fevers or weight loss. Patient
should have repeat CT in 3 months and follow up with outpatient
pulmonology.
.
# Alzheimer's: Recently diagnosed with alzheimers.  Patient
noted to be more forgetful lately, not recognizing family
members and rememberi
