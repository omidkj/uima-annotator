History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 96713**] is an 82-year-old female with severe diastolic
heart failure, moderate pulmonary hypertension, afib on
anticoagulation, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic anemia who
was admitted to the orthopedics service for a left femoral neck
transverse fracture which occured in the setting of a mechanical
fall while cleaning her house on [**2171-9-14**]. She denied any chest
pain, palpitations, pre-syncopal, or syncopal episodes prior to
the fall. She denied any LOC or any head trauma.
.
After ortho surgery she was extubated. She was intitially
satting well on 4LNC. She became progressively more hypoxic,
hypertensive, tachycardic (A fib to 130s) and tachypneic. She
was placed on NRB and an ABG was obtained which showed
hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. A CXR showed
pulmonary edema. She was given lasix and nitropaste and put out
300 ccs of urine. She was then placed on BIPAP. While on BIPAP,
she was noted to have a focal motor (arm) seizure which was new
to her which resolved prior to receiving any medications. She
developed a second right arm focal motor seizure
post-operatively and was given 2 mg of ativan IV. She was
hypoxic during the event and was bagged by anesthesia. She was
then placed back on BIPAP.  Patient was transferred to the MICU.
.
Patient was diuresed in the MICU.  She had a head CT due to
seizure activity that was negative.  She had an echo that showed
diastolic HF and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Also post op
was given 1 unit RBCs.  Patient was transferred to the floor and
she has been stable

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 96713**] is an 82 yo female with severe chronic diastolic
HF, afib on coumadin, HTN, moderate pulmonary hypertension,
rheumatoid arthritis, chronic anemia who is s/p hip replacement
for mechanical fall complicated by post-op hypoxia.
.
SHORTNESS OF BREATH: SOB is likely secondary to diastolic CHF
given that she is known to have significant diastolic CHF and
has had several admissions for CHF exacerbations. She reportedly
got only 1L NS in the OR and 2 units of FFP. Additionally her
post-op pain may have contributed to tachycardia and worsening
diastolic dysfunction.  Patient was transferred to the MICU
post-op and diuresed with lasix.  A dilt drip was started for HR
control and blood pressure was controlled with nitropast/drip.
An a-line was placed in the MICU for frequent abgs.  Home
digoxin and spironolactone were continued.  Patient was
stablized and transferred to the floor on [**2171-9-17**].  On the floor
she has not complained of shortness of breath.  She was on
oxygen upon transfer, but has not required O2 for the past 2
days; she is satting well on room air.
