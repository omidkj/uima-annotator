Brief Hospital Course:
PROLONGED ICU COURSE SUMMARIZED BY ORGAN SYSTEM

[**1-31**] ex lap/right colectomy, end ileostomy, mucus fistula, J
tube
[**2-15**] open tracheostomy
[**2-25**] ERCP for hyperbilirubinemia - biliary & pancreatic stents
placed
[**2-26**] HD catheter & CVL pulled because of MRSE sepsis

NEURO: sedated with propofol & benzos postop, gradually weaned
off after trach.  now responding appropriately, no neuro
deficits.  pain controlled with narcotics.

CARDS: baseline a fib.  TEE obtained to r/o embolic source for
colon ischemia (negative for thrombus, EF > 55%).  required
significant pressors after surgery for hypotension & oliguria.
midodrine started with good effect.  weaned off pressors
completely by last weekend.  coumadin had been restarted for a
fib maintenance, but stopped after patient became septic with
transaminitis & supratherapeutic INR (~12).

RESP: open trach performed 2 weeks postop.  weaning vent.
requires extra PEEP/PSV to help with respiratory drive (lower
rate with higher driving pressures).  bronch'd.  currently bring
treated for retrocardiac pneumonia with levaquin (day 4 of 7).

FEN: ATN complicated postop course.  renal following daily.
originally treated with CVVHD x 2 wks, but line removed for GPC
bacteremia.  creatinine to 5.5 now (from 1.5 after HD), but
renal not interested in starting hemodilaysis yet.  transplant
surgery aware, in case permacath or long term dialysis access
needed.

GI: prolonged ileus postop, but now ostomy functioning fine.
was initially on TPN but now tolerating tube feeds without
issue.  NGT placed during last week's sepsis now removed.
developed line sepsis last week, with GPC bacteremia but also
marked transaminitis & hyperbili.  given h/o TPN, RUQ US showed
biliary sludge & distended CBD.  ERCP was unremarkable but
stents placed in CBD & panc duct resulted in improved bile
excretion.

HEME: multiple transfusions given (see blood bank record).  was
anticoagulated briefly for a fib, but developed supratherapeutic
INR in setting of sepsis-induced liver failure.  coumadin since
held.  hepSC being given

ID: 2 week course of postop broad spectrum antibiotics
(including fluconazole).  although TEN resulted from imipenem
administration, patient tolerated cefepime without incident.
currently on vanco (day 5 of 7) for GPC bacteremia & levo (day 4
of 7) for retrocardiac pneumonia.

ENDO: blood sugars well controlled with RISS.  2 separate [**Last Name (un) 104**]
stim tests showed no adrenal insufficiency ([**Last Name (un) 104**] stim +9 both
times)

DISPO: family well involved.  phone numbers in chart.
