Admission Date:  [**2131-11-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2131-11-28**]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old
Vietnamese female with a past medical history significant for
type 2 diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline
creatinine of 1.2 to 1.6), congestive heart failure (with an
Coumadin) who was transferred from her nursing home for

On the day of admission she was noted to be more pale and
weak and had difficulty standing and participating in her usual
activities.  She needed assistance with transfer from bed to
chair and is ambulatory with a walker at baseline.  She had
ago with ecchymosis across her pelvis.  Laboratories drawn
were significant for a hematocrit of 22, a creatinine of 1.9,

The patient was sent to the Emergency Room where she received
1 amp of calcium gluconate, 10 units of insulin, and 0.5 amp
of D-50.  Kayexalate was given by nasogastric tube, to which
she had a melanotic bowel movement.  She was hydrated with
1 liter of normal saline for hyponatremia thought to be
secondary to dehydration.  Digoxin level was 3.4.  She had a
large amount of guaiac-positive stool and had a nasogastric
lavage in the Emergency Room which was reportedly negative.
She had a head CT which was negative for any acute changes,
as well as an abdominal CT which was negative for a
retroperitoneal bleed.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination the patient had a temperature of 98.4, heart rate
of 70 which was paced, blood pressure of 108/65,  a
respiratory rate of 17, her oxygen saturation was 99% on room
air.  In general, she appeared to be a frail elderly female
in no acute distress.  Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
examination revealed her pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Her extraocular movements were intact.
Her oral mucosa was moist and nonerythematous.  Her
oropharynx was benigna.  On neck examination, her neck was
supple without jugular venous distention, lymphadenopathy, or
bruits.  Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally;
however, she did have decreased breath sounds at the bases.
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with a normal first heart
sound and second heart sound.  A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur
at the right upper sternal border and apex; unable to
appreciate radiation.  The abdomen was soft and mildly tender
in the lower quadrants.  No palpable masses.  Ecchymosis in
the lower quadrants, decreased bowel sounds.  On rectal
examination the patient was guaiac-positive.  Extremity
examination revealed no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses and
posterior tibialis pulses.

LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:
white blood cell count of 15.5, hematocrit of 23.3 (baseline 34
to 36), a platelet count of 379, and mean cell volume of 89; 85%
segs, 0 bands, 9 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes.  PT was 22.5, PTT was
30.5, INR of 3.5.  The patient had a urinalysis with a specific
gravity of 1.010, negative nitrite, pH of 5, 0 red blood cells, 0
white blood cells.  She had a sodium of 123 (baseline 134 to
137), potassium of 8.5, chloride of 95, bicarbonate of 19, blood
urea nitrogen of 107 (baseline 20 to 30), creatinine of 2.1
(baseline 1.5 to 1.6), glucose of 218.  On a repeat she had a
sodium of 128, and a potassium of 7.8.  Albumin 3.9, calcium of
9.8, phosphate of 2.7, magnesium of 2.3.  Digoxin level of 3.4.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray revealed no acute cardiopulmonary
process.

CT of the head was negative for an acute intracranial
process.

Electrocardiogram was paced with no previous paced
electrocardiogram for comparison.  Nonpaced electrocardiogram in
[**2131-7-28**] was significant for atrial fibrillation, normal
QRS, T wave flattening in the voltage in the precordial leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In general, this is an 86-year-old female
with multiple medical problems including chronic renal
insufficiency, atrial fibrillation (on digoxin, Coumadin, and
aspirin) who presented with a likely upper gastrointestinal
bleed (negative lavage), and dehydrated with subsequent
worsening prerenal azotemia, hyperkalemia, and digoxin
toxicity.  The patient was admitted initially to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further management.

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  Per the Emergency Room report,
the nasogastric lavage was negative.  The patient's elevated
INR of 3.5 was likely secondary to Coumadin.  We discontinued
her Coumadin and aspirin.  We started her on Protonix 40 mg
intravenously b.i.d.   She was given 10 mg of vitamin K
subcutaneously.

The Gastroenterology Service was consulted.  We opted to
transfuse the patient with 2 units of packed red blood cells
which raised her hematocrit to 33.3.  It was the opinion of
the Gastroenterology Service that given all of her other
medical issues she should be managed conservatively with no
interventions unless there was evidence of rebleed.  We
reversed her Coumadin with vitamin K which was given for
three consecutive days.  This decreased her INR to 1.1.  We
sent her stool for Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and
Escherichia coli to rule out a possible inflammatory bloody
diarrhea.  We followed her hematocrit closely.  Throughout
the remainder of her hospital stay the patient's hematocrit
remained stable.  She was transferred to the General Medicine
[**Hospital1 **] on hospital day three.

She continued to do well.  We opted to continue to hold both
her aspirin and her Coumadin.  There was no evidence of
rebleeding.  Her diet was advanced, and she was switched to
oral Protonix.  The Gastroenterology Service signed off at
this point.  We watched her for an additional 24 hours.  By
hospital day five, her hematocrit remained stable in the
middle 30s.  The patient did not require any additional
transfusions after the initial 2 units that she was given.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Given the patient's significant cardiac
history, she was ruled out for myocardial infarction with
serial creatine kinases and troponins.  We opted to hold her
aspirin and beta blocker.  She did not tolerate a beta
blocker previously secondary to her depressed ejection
fraction.  We monitored her closely for signs of congestive
heart failure.  She was started on low-dose Isordil and
hydralazine for her congestive heart failure.  We opted to
not initiate an ACE inhibitor in this patient given her
history of hyperkalemia as well as her chronic renal
insufficiency.  We switched her amiodarone to 200 mg p.o.
q.d. since she had been on the loading dose of 400 mg for one
month.  We rechecked her digoxi
