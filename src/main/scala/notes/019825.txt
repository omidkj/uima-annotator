mute and right sided weakness.

IVtPA administration


History of Present Illness:
CC:[**CC Contact Info **]
Code paged 4:54pm
Patient seen 5:04pm

NIHSS per ED staff 18

HPI: Patient is a 79yo RHW with complicated PMH including CAD,
Afib and s/p pacemaker who was found to be mute with R sided
weakness around 3pm today by her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] husband, she was
seen
in her usual self (independently ambulatory and does all ADLs on
her
own) between 2:30 to 3 when he left to pick up food.  When he
returned around 3pm, he found her in bed not talking and unable
to move her R hence 911 was called.

Of note, the patient has Afib and is on Coumadin but this has
been suspended for the past 8~9 days for US/endoscopy which she
underwent 3 days ago.  She was suppose to restart Coumadin as of
tomorrow.

ROS completely negative otherwise and she has no hx of prior
strokes or hemorrhage including GI bleed.  Given that she
arrived
within 3 hours of last well known time and found to be mute with
R facial droop, L gaze deviation and R sided weakness, IV tPA
was
administered after stat imaging including CTA/P showed no bleed
but likely M2 occlusion.  INR was 1.2 in the ED.

Imaging/Studies:

CTA/CT/CTP [**7-4**]:

CTA: There is a normal variant bovine configuration of the
aortic arch with
mild atherosclerosis involving the arch and origins of the great
vessels.
There is no high-grade stenosis. The image quality is degraded
by motion
artifact, the common and cervical internal carotid arteries are
patent with
mild atherosclerotic disease at the bifurcations. There is
tortuosity of the
cervical segments of the internal carotid arteries, which are
medialized. ICA
luminal transverse dimensions are 5 mm on the right and 4 mm on
the left.
There is mild atherosclerotic disease involving the cavernous
segments of the
internal carotid arteries bilaterally. There is abrupt cutoff of
the distal
M1 segment of the left middle cerebral artery with slightly
diminished
asymmetric enhancement of the more distal MCA branches on the
left.
Associated with this, there is a more evident region of
hypoattenuation within
the parenchyma of the left frontal lobe with abnormal low
attenuation
extending into the insular cortex where there is loss of
differentiation. The
lentiform nucleus is defined on the left side. The right middle
cerebral
artery is normal, as are the anterior cerebral arteries. The
posterior
circulation is normal. There is persistent fetal formation of
the right
posterior cerebral artery with a hypoplastic right P1 segment.
The vertebral
arteries are patent bilaterally.

PERFUSION: There is diminished blood volume throughout
approximately the
anterior one-third of the left middle cerebral artery territory.
There is a
similar distribution of elevated mean transit time throughout
this region,
with slightly expanded region of nearing the vertex. Findings
are compatible
with a completed infarct involving just over one-third of the
left MCA
territory with a very small number superiorly.

There is extensive pleural thickening and/or fluid on the right.
There is
normal interlobular septal thickening. There are scattered nodes
throughout
the neck without identifiable pathologic features. There is
slight nodularity
to the membranous portion of the trachea, which may represent
retained
secretions. There are advanced multilevel degenerative changes
of the
cervical spine with multilevel foraminal narrowing.

IMPRESSION:

1. The findings suggest an acute embolus in the distal M1
segment of the left
middle cerebral artery resulting in infarction of just over
one-third of the
middle cerebral artery distribution anteriorly, with minimal
ischemic tissues
at risk near the vertex. There is no hemorrhagic conversion.

2. Extensive pleural thickening and/or fluid on the right, which
should be
correlated with chest imaging.

[**7-5**] CT head:

IMPRESSION:
1. Left MCA stroke, status post tPA without evidence of
intracranial
hemorrhage.
2. Mild right sphenoid sinus mucosal disease.

ECHO [**7-5**]:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-11-13**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly increased. The
