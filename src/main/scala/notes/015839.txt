Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred from outside hospital for treatment of
pneumonia and pulmonary embolus after pneumonectomy.  He was
treated with antibiotics and therapeutic low-molecular weight
heparin.  Generally, was recovering well and complained only of
generalized weakness and difficulty swallowing.
  To support his nutrition, PEG was attempted and aborted due to
poor transillumination.  Open feeding jejunostomy was performed
without event.  The patient was awaiting transfer to rehab when
he underwent severe respiratory distress requiring intubation.
  Bronchoscopy and CT angiogram of the chest were unremarkable.
EKG and ECHO led to some suspicion for primary cardiac event.
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated no acute MI but critical
right heart failure and severe pulmonary hypertension.
  The patient was maintained on epinephrine drip and nitric
oxide therapy for 48 hours, but eventually developed liver
failure and renal failure from hypoperfusion.  After significant
discussion with the patient's two daughters and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
vasopressors were withdrawn after the patient and family met
with Catholic services.  The patient expired shortly afterward.
