Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
RUQ abdominal pain
Reason for MICU admission: respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
fiberoptic intubation with anesthesia
PICC line placement
Arterial line placement
IJ central venous catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70yo female, with DM, HTN, and asthma, who presented
to the ED with RUQ abdominal pain, and was admitted to the ICU
for respiratory failure.  History was obtained from ED and
husband as patient now intubated.  Per report, she developed
shortness of breath over three days and aches throughout her
body.  Pain had some radiation to right shoulder and was
generally worse in RUQ. No cough or rhinorrhea.  She also
endorsed subjective fevers and mild shortness of breath with
wheezing at home.  No sick contacts.  Presented to PCP today and
was noted to be dyspneic in waiting room, with O2 sats in the
low 80s on room air.  She was given ASA 325 mg at clinic.
.
In the ED, initial CXR showed RLL pneumonia.  Patient was given
ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and 2L NS.  Ipratropium and albuterol
nebs given.  Refused flu swab but received 75 mg tamiflu.
Became more short of breath with desaturations and was then 90%
on NRB.  The patient was a very difficult intubation - at least
5 unsuccessful attempts with glidescope; eventually required
stat fiberoptic intubation with anesthesia.  Got succ x2 doses,
10 mg vecuronium, etomidate, ativan. On transfer, patient
satting 94% on FiO2 1 with PEEP 5.
.
On arrival to MICU, patient intubated and sedated with residual
effects of paralytics.  Given solumedrol 125, mag, vanco 1 gram,
and albuterol.

Past Medical History:
- Diabetes Type II
- Hypertension
- Asthma: O2 sats at baseline low 90s on RA
- Hypertriglyceridemia

From [**Country 3587**] in [**2142**].  Married, lives with husband of 50
years, independent in ADLs. 5 children.  No EtOH, no smoking.

General: Intubated, sedated and paralyzed.
HEENT: PERRL, sclera anicteric, MMM, ETT and OGT in place.
Neck: obese, supple, difficult to appreciate JVD elevation.

IMAGING:
[**2151-10-29**] ADMISSION CXR:
1. Right lower lobe and right middle lobe consolidation,
atelectasis, and
likely right pleural effusion.
2. Streaky left basilar retrocardiac opacity may reflect
atelectasis and/or consolidation.

[**2151-11-1**] TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic left
ventricular systolic function. Mildly dilated/hypokinetic right
ventricle. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. No evidence of PFO/ASD with agitated
saline.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2143-10-11**], LV function appears hyperdynamic and
the right ventricle appears mildly dilated/hypokinetic.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressures could not be determined on
the prior study.

[**2151-11-4**] CT SINUS:
The patient is intubated. There is mild mucosal thickening of
the
left maxillary sinus. The right maxillary sinus demonstrates a
fluid level. There is opacification of many of the right-sided
ethmoid air cells. Aerosolized secretions are noted in
left-sided ethmoid air cells. There is mild mucosal thickening
of the ethmoid air cells bilaterally. There is near
opacification of the sphenoid sinus, with only small foci of
air. Frontal sinuses are absent. The ostiomeatal units are
patent bilaterally. There is [**Last Name (un) 36826**] type II of the fovea
ethmoidalis bilaterally. There may be slight demineralization of
the cribiform plate. The sphenoid sinus septum is midline with
insertion on the clivus. An impacted canine tooth is noted in
the left maxilla.
IMPRESSION: Extensive sinus disease as described above with
fluid levels and aerosolized secretions. This may represent an
acute on chronic sinusitis.

[**2151-11-4**] CT TORSO:
1. Large right basal effusion and small left basal effusion with
atelectasis in the lower lobes bilaterally. The heart is
enlarged. Scattered ground-glass opacities seen throughout both
lungs, the appearances may represent fluid overload versus
infection.
2. 5-mm nodular opacity in the right middle lobe should be
followed up with a chest CT in three months if the patient is at
increased risk or has prior history of malignancy, otherwise
followup chest CT in one year is recommended as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**]
guidelines.
3. Abdominopelvic ascites and fatty liver.
4. No abscess or collection present in the abdomen or pelvis.

Brief Hospital Course:
70F with DM, HTN, asthma; presenting to ED with RUQ pain with
development of hypoxic respiratory failure and ARDS, possible R
pneumonia, had increasing vent requirements, and evolving
metabolic lactic and respiratory acidosis and shock picture,
with evidence of liver and renal organ damage.  Had several
episodes of PEA arrest requiring shocks. Currently, she has been
more stable for the past several days, was weaned off the vent
and been afebrile x 3 days (Tm 101.5 [**2151-11-11**]).
