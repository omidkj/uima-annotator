pain in the right lower quadrant that has subsequently gotten
worse over the day. She was taken to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital where
a CT scan showed a right renal mass. Then, at that point, it
was discovered that ten years ago she was diagnosed with
angiomyolipoma, however, she had been asymptomatic until this
day, [**2137-8-13**]. She was subsequently brought to [**Hospital1 **] for further care. She has no history of any
renal procedures or surgeries.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Metformin b.i.d., verapamil 80
t.i.d., sulfazine b.i.d., 81 mg aspirin daily, and ibuprofen
600 mg b.i.d. to t.i.d.

b.i.d., furosemide 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., insulin sliding scale,
morphine 2-4 mg q.2 hours p.r.n. pain, oxycodone 5 mg p.o.
q.4 hours.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**8-13**], and
she was taken to the surgical ICU where she was transfused 3
units. Her angiomyolipoma was embolized on [**8-15**].
Subsequently the next morning, she began to experience
desaturations and complained of chest pain. A CTA and chest x-
ray showed signs of CHF. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and
she was given 20 of hydralazine as well as Lasix. She
subsequently stabilized and was transferred to the floor on
[**8-16**]. While she was on the floor, her blood pressure
continued to remain elevated. A medicine consult was obtained
and she was also maintained on hydralazine 20 and 40 p.o. of
Lasix per medicine's recommendations. Her hydralazine was
used only in cases of elevated blood pressure when the Lasix
and her verapamil did not decrease her systolic blood
pressure to less than 150. Throughout her hospital stay, her
verapamil was discontinued and she was begun on 12.5 mg of
captopril p.o. t.i.d. She was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction by having negative cardiac enzymes and negative CK
MB and negative troponin x3. A repeat EKG was also normal. An
echocardiogram was obtained on her third postoperative day,
sixth hospital day, and that was negative. A stress test was
also obtained 2 days later and that was also negative for any
heart disease. Her postoperative course remained
uncomplicated. Her blood cultures, urine cultures showed no
growth through her day of discharge and she had mild fevers
which was expected secondary to her embolization procedure.
She was discharged on hospital day eight, postprocedure day
5, in good condition. She was sent home with her captopril,
her oxycodone 5 mg and her Cipro b.i.d. for 7 days. She was
also instructed to visit her family physician prior to coming
to the hospital for procedure for radical right nephrectomy
so that her primary care physician was aware of her new blood
pressure medication and changes. She was consented for a
right radical nephrectomy which is to take place on Monday,
[**8-26**], and she was instructed to call if she had any
further questions or concerns.
