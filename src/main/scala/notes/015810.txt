Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to the ED, the pt's BP was 111/65. He was taken
emergantly to the CT scanner to evaluate for dissection which
was negative. Then, the pt had an ECG done that was concerning
for a junctional rhythem at 60 beats per minute. A cardiology
consult was obtained and the pt eventually converted
spontanously into sinus rhythem. However, he then developed a
fever to 101 rectally and a code sepsis was called. At this
time, the pt was hypotensive with a SBP in the 70s. He was
started on dopamine with an improvement in his BP. A neurology
consult was also obtained but they were not overly concerned
about the pt's lower extremity numbness which had resolved.
   Extensive workup for sepsis was unrevealing. Initially the
patient was treated with dopamine and levophed, to keep his MAP
> 12 and vancomycin, ceftazidime, and flagyl for antiobiotics.
Eventually, his antibiotics were stopped, since no casue of
infection was found.  Near the end of [**Month (only) 116**], a chest x-ray was
suspicious for pneumonia.  He was treated empirically with
levaquin.
   Initially, he experienced altered mental status:  he became
very agitated but never disoriented.  Head CT was negative. He
was then extremly agitated and required intubation on HD#2 for
sedation.  When he was later extubated, he was transferred to
the floor.  However, he again had respiratory distress and had
to be reintubated.  The second time an extubation attempt was
made, his respiratory status had improved and he remained
extubated.
   On hospital day #2, he complained in increaing abdominal pain
and was taken to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy which was
negative for intrabdominal pathology.  This was later
complicated by wound dehiscence, for which an additional surgery
was required.  He tolerated this procedure well.  While he was
in the hospital, his liver function began to worsen.  It seemed
out of proportion to his baseline hepatitis C.  Imaging was done
and revealed a portal vein thrombosis.  He was initially started
on a heparin drip, but his platelets slowly drifted downward.
He was HIT negative when first checked, but later tests revealed
his was HIT positive.  An argatroban drip was then used.
However, he developed hepatorenal syndrome and his kidney
function made it extremely difficult to control the argatroban
drip.  This was therefore stopped and he was started on
coumadin.  He was trasfused multiple times during his hospital
stay for blood loss anemia.  Prior to discharge the patient was
trasfused two units of PRBCs and 2U FFP for rising INR.  His
coumadin was held indefinitely as his INR was persistently high
despite the fact that his coumadin had been stopped, and he
developed epistaxis.  After these blood products were infused he
was given IV lasix to prevent fluid overload, given his renal
failure.  His INR will need to be monitored as an outpatient.
   During his hospital course, his Cr was rapidly rising and he
was oliguric despite CVP in low 20s.  He developed acute renal
failure and, as mentioned above, hepatorenal syndrome.  A renal
consult was obtained and he required dialysis.  At the time he
decided to make plans for hospice care, the patient requested to
discontinue dialysis.  Due to his persistently high phosphate,
he was started on calcium acetate.
   At the beginning of his admission, he had a junctional rhythm
on admission that quickly resolved.  He had no further cardiac
issues. Pt had a bedside echo in the ED which did not show any
wall motion abnormalities. Ruled out for MI.
   The patient has HIV.  His HAART therapy was held initially
when he was NPO, then restarted.  It was again held later when
his kidney and liver function began to worsen. He was maintained
on OI PPx with Diflucan. Prior to discharge it was decided that
the PPI would be discontinued and HIV medications would not be
restarted.
  Although the patient has a history of hypertension, his home
antihypertensives were held given that he was persistently
hypotensive throughout his stay.
   Late in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, the decision was made
to get the palliative care nurse involved in his care.  The
patient decided on his own [**Location (un) **] that he wanted to have DNR/DNI
status, and that he wanted to leave the hospital and begin
hospice care.  These arrangements were all made, and he was
discharged to his friend's home with hospice
