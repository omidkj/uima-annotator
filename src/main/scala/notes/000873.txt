History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 year old male with a PMH significant for HTN,
dyslipidemia, DMII, who presented to the ED with malaise, poor
appetite, and dry cough for 5 days PTA. 3 days prior to
admission he noted onset of bilateral lower extremity edema. 1
day prior to admission, noted severe generalized weakness. He
notes he has been sleeping in a chair for the last 2 nights
because he could not get into bed. He denies any recent HA,
visual changes, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath,
orthopnea, PND, abd. pain, N/V/D, fevers, chills, rash, or
dysuria. He sleeps on 2 pillows normally and this has not
changed. He notes prior to this episode that he was able to walk
for 30 minutes a day without any symptoms.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.8, 118/90, 88, 96% RA.
However, shortly there after he went into a.fib with RVR, rates
in the 130s to 150s.
Given diltiazem 10 x 3, without improvement. Then given
metoprolol 5 x 1 without improved. Started on amiodarone load
but stopped due to hypotension, with SBP in the 80's. Then he
was given 100mg PO metoprolol and levofloxacin for ? infiltrate
on exam. Received KCL 60 mg and 2L IVF. Noted to be more
tachypneic after the fluids with cxr showing large heart, ?
effusion. He was then admitted to the CCU for further management
of RVR with hypotension.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On arrival the patient states that he feels generally weak but
otherwise well.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2148-10-30**]
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left  ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. RV with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Dilated cardiomyopathy (tachycardia mediated?)
