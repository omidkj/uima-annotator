History of Present Illness:
.
58F with a history of metastatic RCC complicated by extensive
mediastinal mets requiring placement of bronchial stent who was
recently admitted for near syncope where she had a work up
including  head CT, which was without changes, a CTA of the
chest which was negative for PE and showed stable masses and an
Echo which showed mild hypokinesis and an 40-45%.
She noted yesterday she had a low grade temp 100.4 that she
states went up to 102 so she contact[**Name (NI) **] her oncologists Dr [**Name (NI) **]
and Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] who told her to come to the hospital if it
continued above 100.4. She has also been experiencing a
significant amount of throat pain from her esphagitis and was
encouraged to use lidocaine/ benedryl for this. She has been
unable to swallow and her PO intake is down. She has also noted
flu like symptoms over the past few days such as myalgias cough
with yello sputum, body aches. She just recieved radiation
therapy yesterday.

She was started on palliative chest XRT ([**2183-8-19**]) and
chemotherapy with sunitinib.

In the ED she was tachycardiac on presentation to 123 and
improved with fluids. She had a T Max of 101.4 for which she was
given rectal tylenol. She had nausea and was give 8mg Zofran.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn, she was flu swabbed and she
was started on Levofloxasin. Her WCC was 1.4 and ANC 1275.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
The patient was in USOH until winter of [**2181**] when she developed
cold symptoms which did not clear with antibiotics. She
developed  hemoptysis, which was evaluated in [**2182-2-9**] with
x-rays of the chest. Lung mediastinal mass was detected on CXR,
which was followed by a CT scan, which confirmed a mass in the
mediastinum. Scanning also indicated a mass in the left kidney.
This was further evaluated  with imaging studies of the abdomen,
which showed a large left renal mass measuring 15 x 11 cm. Lytic
lesion was also detected in the right acetabulum. She was
further evaluated with MRI which showed a left renal mass with
no evidence of involvement of the left renal vein. MRI scan
showed a mass in the vertex of the skull measuring 5 cm in
greatest dimension. She underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate the
hemoptysis symptoms and biopsy the lung mass. However, pathology
from this study was inconclusive. She underwent a biopsy of the
left kidney mass, which showed renal cell carcinoma [**Last Name (un) 19076**]
nuclear grade 1. These slides have been reviewed and showed
renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, and nuclear grade 1. With
these findings, she underwent radiation therapy to the right hip
and leg receiving 10 treatments at the [**Hospital6 5016**].
Following these treatments, she was evaluated by the Biologics
group and the Urology group for definitive treatment of renal
cell carcinoma. Recommendation was for dendritic cell vaccine
therapy. For this therapy, she will require a tumor sample. She
is now s/p left debulking nephrectomy [**2183-4-11**].

Pertinent Results:
TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2183-8-28**],
the LVEF has significantly decreased. There is now a small
pericardial effusion.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis
1. Distended gallbladder, with no definite CT evidence of
cholecystitis. If clinical concern, this can be further
evaluated with HIDA scan.

2. Interval free fluid in the abdomen, mostly at the perihepatic
and
perisplenic distribution and tracking along the right paracolic
gutter into the pelvis. Bilateral pleural effusions.

3. Questionable wall thickenning of the colon at the splenic
flexture, could be due to collapsed colon; however this finding
can be seen in colitis, if there is clinical concern.

4. Stable right acetabular lesion with pathologic fracture at
the right
inferior acetabulum, unchanged. Multiple lesions within the
spine consistent with metastatic disease, with possible
hemangioma at L1.

5. Status post left nephrectomy with no definite evidence of
recurrence at
the surgical bed.
.
EEG [**9-15**]:  This is a normal video EEG study. Interictal
background activity was normal. There were no epileptiform
discharges or electrographic seizures. Compared to recording
from 24 hours prior, this study contains fewer electrographic
seizures
.
EEG [**9-13**]
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to continuous generalized
rhythmic spike and slow wave activity at a frequency of 2.5 Hz
for the first half of this record consistent with non-convulsive
status epilepticus. EEG markedly improved after administration
of I.V. Ativan with resolution of non-convulsive status and only
brief short bursts of generalized spike slow wave discharges in
the latter half of the study. No focal lateralizing features
were noted. An irregularly irregular rhythm was seen on cardiac
monitor. Based on these findings, we would recommend long-term
monitoring for this patient
.
MR head:
Compared to the previous MRI from [**2183-2-18**], the soft tissue
component
associated with the vertex frontal bone calvarial lesion has
markedly
decreased in size likely reflecting interval treatment. The bony
component
appears relatively stable. This may represent treated neoplasm
in bone.
.
Left frontal scalp lesion is unchanged compared to the most
recent study.
.
There is no evidence for intracranial metastatic disease.
.
There is diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, which may be
related to prior
radiation/LP or infectious/inflammatory sequela. Appearance is
not suggestive of dural mets. There is a tiny 5- mm left frontal
subdural focal thickening or collection which does not cause
mass effect.
.
[**9-19**] CXR (post-bronch):  Atelectasis in the left base has
minimally improved. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.
