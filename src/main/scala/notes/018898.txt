Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
sudden onset dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation x2 days;

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5057**] is a 77yo M with HTN, HL, COPD, and newly diagnosed
NSCLC , now s/p his first round of chemotherapy. He was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED in the midst of a RBC transfusion
when he developed sudden shortness of breath that was
interpreted as a possible transfusion reaction.
.
He appears to have severe COPD caused by an extensive smoking
history. He has poor exercise tolerance which has only worsened
in the preceding months. Any exertion, including walking down
the street, can cause increased RR and profound SOB. Albuterol
can help stop these episodes. He has been pursed-lip breathing
for years. He recently underwent TTE evaluation of his exercise
intolerance, at which point a relatively large pericardial
effusion with tamponade physiology was seen. He was admitted to
the CCU [**9-2**]- [**9-6**] and underwent pericardiocentesis, which
revealed malignant cells. He recently underwent his first chemo
session with taxol for NSCLC. His oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 349**] at
[**Location (un) 2274**].
.
His fatigue and poor exercise tolerance persisted. He was found
to be anemic to 25 and subsequently was brought to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**]
for blood transfusion. Midway through the transfusion, he
developed worsening SOB and increased RR. He thinks this episode
was similar to his usual bouts of breathlessness, and he
admittedly was upset with how long the transfusion was taking.
Fearing a transfusion reaction, he was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, he was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic.
Received 20mg IV lasix and underwent BiPAP trial, which was
poorly tolerated. Of note, he continued to saturate in the
upper90s on 3-4LNC, though remained tachypneic. A bedside echo
was done which showed no pericardial effusion per the ED read.
He was transferred to the MICU for concern of increased WOB. VS
prior to transfer were 97.9 108 150/80 36 99/4L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, his intial VS were 96.5, 107, 153/63, 95
3LNC. He continues to purse-lip breath. He describes frequent
episodes similar to his breathlessness on transfusion, which
often pass after coughing or spitting. He otherwise feels well
aside from fatigue. He notes no recent couging or cold-like
smpyotms, no sore throat, fevers, chills, chest pains or
pressure. He has lower extremity edema but no PND, orthopnea. No
recent F/C. In the midst of our interview, he had the urge to
urinate and abruptly stood to use his urinal- he developed
respiratory distress with saturations dipping to the 80s and
tachypnea to 50. This episode resolved with supplemental 02. He
felt it was similar to the events surrounding his infusion.
.

Physical Exam:
Admission Exam:
Vitals: 96.5, 107, 153/63, 95 3LNC
General: Alert, oriented, pursed-lip breathing in the 30s
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: diffuse wheezing heard throughout anterior and posterior
lung fields. Fair air movement. No crackles or rhonchi.
CV: tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly. Abdominal
musculature used in exhalation.
GU: foley in place
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema

At the time of his discharge, the patient's vital signs were
stable and he had O2 sats of 96% on 2L NC.  While he continued
to have wheezes with fair air movement on lung exam, there were
no basilar crackles.  THere was no edema or elevation of the
JVP. The Foley had been removed.

EKG [**2132-10-7**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch
block. Probable small R waves in leads II, III and aVF but
consider prior inferior myocardial infarction. ST-T wave
abnormalities. Low precordial voltage. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2132-9-3**] the rate is faster. ST-T wave abnormalities
are more prominent. Precordial voltage is less prominent.
Clinical correlation is suggested

CXR [**2132-10-7**]:
1. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, similar
compared to the
prior PET-CT.
2. Dilated and tortuous ascending thoracic aorta.
3. Patchy opacities within the lung bases, which could reflect
atelectasis, infection, or aspiration.
4. Known spiculated nodule in the right upper lobe is better
appreciated on the recent PET CT.

TTE [**2132-10-8**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal
free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not
