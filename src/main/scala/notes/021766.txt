Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Pain and bleeding at site of R AV fistula


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis catheter placement
Left IJ placement
Arterial Line Placement

History of Present Illness:
68 yof with ESRD unknown etiology, COPD on chronic steroids, who
presents after bleeding from AV fistula followed by hypotension,
altered mental status.

Friday [**6-23**] she had uneventful dialysis. Saturday evening [**6-24**] she
was nauseated, vomited x 1. Sunday [**6-25**] spent mostly in bed with
generalized malaise. In afternoon got up, noted her AV fistula
to have a "black spot" that "looked infected" so she put an
antibiotic-impregnated bandaid on it. It began to ooze blood,
and a concerned neighbor called 911. At [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital,
after a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 83353**] [**Last Name (Titles) 83354**] fistula, it opened into an
arterial bleed through which she lost 150-400cc of blood. Bleed
was controlled with sutures and surgicel. Her BP dropped from
125/79 to 80/60. She received 1 liter NS, and a dose of
Vancomycin IV which caused a red rash, treated with Benadryl.
Vanc was discontinued and she was given Ancef IV and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

On arrival to our emergency department her vitals were T: 99.7
BP: 84/52 HR: 88 RR: 18 O2: 99% on RA. The fistula site
demonstrated a palpable thrill, no erythema, the suture site was
clean and dry. Her K+ was 6.8 with peaked T waves on EKG, her
SBPs drifted into the 70s and her mental status declined. She
received 4 L NS, calcium gluconate 2 gram IV x 1, 1 amp D50, 10
units regular insulin SC, 1 amp bicarbonate IV, Zosyn 4.5 grams
IV x 1 and was started on Levophed. Nephrology was contact[**Name (NI) **] for
urgent dialysis evaluation. Left IJ placed for access after
failed attempt at right IJ. She was admitted to the MICU.

In the MICU she received 5 liters IVF, was weaned off of
Levophed 12 hours after arrival.

Past Medical History:
- End stage renal disease on hemodialysis for two years
- Coronary artery disease (recent catheterization with normal
coronary arteries)
- Diastolic heart failure (EF on recent catheterization 60%)
- COPD (on 2L home oxygen at night)


Social History:
Previous 40 pack year history but quit 4 months ago.  No alcohol
or illict drug use.  Lives by herself.


Family History:
Strong family history of CAD in father and brother.

Right Upper Extremity Ultrasound [**2124-6-26**]:
By report, the patient has a fistula, which is patent on color
Doppler examination. Surrounding the fistula, there is
hypoechoic material which likely represents a hematoma
surrounding the vessel and less likely a pseudoaneurysm with
thrombosis. This area measures approximately 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm.
Son[**Name (NI) 493**] exam over this region did prompt bleeding through
the skin at which time the exam was terminated and dressing
applied by the patient's nurse.

CXR Portable [**2124-6-26**]: Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
There is no focal consolidation. There are increased
interstitial opacities consistent with fluid overload. There is
no definite focal consolidation or pneumothorax. The osseous
structures are grossly unremarkable.

EKG: normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, no st
segment elevation or depression, small amount of peaked twaves.



Brief Hospital Course:
68 yof with ESRD unknown etiology, COPD on chronic steroids, who
presents after bleeding from AV fistula followed by hypotension,
altered mental status.


On the medicine floor, she was alert and cheerful, with family
in the room.

# Hemorrhagic Shock Due to Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to
Fistula Bleeding:
- Differential considerations include septic shock given
prodromal illness, possibly from site of AV fistula and possibly
[**1-24**] her chronic steroid dosing; adrenal insufficiency [**1-24**]
chronic steroid use; and hypovolemic shock [**1-24**] hemorrhage. Blood
and urine cxs were sent and remain negative. In the ICU she
received stress-dose steroid boluses, a dose of IV Zosyn. She
rapidly improved and when she arrived on the medical floors was
stable clinically. She was observed with no recurrence of
hypotension.

# Stage V Chronic Kidney Disease:
Given the bleed the AV fistula could not be used. A tunneled
hemodialysis catheter was placed in the L subclavian, and she
had hemodialysis the morning of her discharge.

# Hyperkalemia:
Resolved after Calcium, D50, Insulin treatments. Of note she had
dialysis while here.

# Acute Blood Loss Anemia, Anemia of ESRD:
Hct stablized at 25.5. Likely a mix of dilutional anemia (she
received 9+ L NS in past 2 days), blood loss from fistula bleed,
and chronic anemia of ESRD.
- follow Hct as outpatient

# COPD:
 On 2L home oxygen at night. No history of intubations. Uses
CPAP overnight for OSA
