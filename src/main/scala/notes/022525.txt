Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated
Hemodialysis continued

History of Present Illness:
46 y/o M w/ ESRD (MWF HD), CAD stents EF 20%, ICD on coumadin
for h/o LV thrombus noted on cath report of '[**81**], has recently
noted lead fracture on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] of early [**Month (only) **]
after having been unresponsive s/p external AED shock but
negative ICD interrogation, --repair disrupted by elevated INR.

Last night, patient found by Mother to be in CP/SOB with
?shaking on floor and non-responsive to mother's commands, EMS
(per report, 20 min for ems arrival) noted WCT and intubated,
CPR, epinephrine with intermittent ROSC but AED advised no
shocks. In [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **], was pulseless with wide complex
tachycardia, treated for hyperkalemia (?spurious result of 11,
truly 4.5-5), ABG 7.26/33/123 on 50% and glucose 59, got epi x1,
shock 200j with ROSC therafer.  No pressors/fluids required.
SBP 100-120 at that time, with HR in 80's.  Then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED he was described as awake and moving
all 4 [**Last Name (LF) 22768**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was not placed on the cooling protocol.
His initial vital signs were 97.5 62 107/75 14 100%. He was
sedated was prn versed. A repeat K was 5 and lactate 7.4 with pH
7.27. His EKG was interpreted as LBBB unchanged from priors. TTE
w/EF 25% and 3+ TR.

On arrival to MICU, patient was tolerating vent w/o difficulty.
GCS status not suitable for cooling protocol.  Patient started
on amio gtt after loading dose and EP consulted.  Patient
extubated w/o difficulty this PM - now on NRB. Renal awaiting
cardiac clearence prior to initiation of HD.
.
Prior to transfer to CCU, patient was extubated, on NRB w/ T
96.7, HR 73, BP120/75, HR 85, RR 19, 98%.

CARDIAC HISTORY:
CABG: none
Percutaneous coronary intervention: as above
Pacemaker/ICD placed: as above

[**2189-9-2**] TTE: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The basal
lateral wall moves best and the remaining segments are
akinetic.. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is no mass/thrombus in the right ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

ETT: per notes, myoview in [**2184**] fixed anterior and inferior
defects, extending to the apex

CARDIAC CATH:
[**2185-1-6**] LHC/RHC (pre-op for Tx eval): 1. Selective coronary
arteriography of this right dominant system revealed
angiographic evidence of no significant flow limiting coronary
artery disease. The LMCA was free of disease. The LAD had patent
previously placed stents with 20% ISR in the proximal segment.
The CFX was free of flow limitations.
2. Left ventriculography was not performed due to the presence
of LV
thrombus.
3. Hemodynamic evaluation demonstrated normal right and left
heart
filling pressures with not pulmonary HTN and preserved cardiac
index.
4. Right femoral arteriotomy site was successfully closed with a
6F
angioseal closure device.

[**2178**] but none since.  No IVDU but remote cocaine use per OMR.

COMPARISON: CT head of [**2188-9-11**].

FINDINGS: Study is limited by motion artifact degrading multiple
axial slices
at the vertex and skull base. Some of the axial slices at the
vertex were
subsequently repeated. Despite limitations as described above,
there is no
evidence of acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally
midline
structures, hydrocephalus, or evidence of major territorial
infarct. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears preserved. The major
intracranial
cisterns are preserved.

The extra-calvarial soft tissues are unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells appear clear.

IMPRESSION: Moderately limited study. While no evidence of major
territorial
infarct is identified, given patient's status of cardiac
pacemaker, a CT
perfusion is recommended if continued concern for infarction is
present.

[**2189-9-15**] TTE
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
