Pertinent Results:
[**2106-4-6**] CXR: Compared with [**2103-3-28**], there is new diffuse
haziness over the right hemithorax consistent with a moderate
pleural effusion. There is a triangular density at the right
lung base, which may indicate right middle lobe collapse. The
left lung remains clear. No overt CHF.
[**2106-4-7**] CNIS: There is no significant common or internal carotid
stenosis bilaterally.
[**2106-4-8**] Chest CT: 1. Longstanding, large right pleural effusion
with relaxation atelectasis. No pleural mass or other evidence
of intrathoracic malignancy or infection. Small left pleural
effusion. 2. Widespread vascular calcifications including three
major coronary arteries. Significant narrowing of the origin of
innominate trunk may be present. Calcific aortic stenosis. 3.
Right breast skin thickening with retroareolar mass containing
clips and calcifications. All the findings might represent post-
treatment appearance but in the absence of previous imaging
including dedicated mammography recurrence cannot be excluded.
4. General fat stranding might represent anasarca.
[**2106-4-11**] Chest CT: 1. Improving small right pleural effusion
without evidence for underlying mass. 2. Right breast skin
thickening and retroareolar mass with clips and calcifications,
most likely postoperative but indeterminate. Further imaging
including dedicated mammography would be necessary if there is
clinical suspicion. 3. Widespread atherosclerotic disease
involving the aorta, its major branches, and coronary arteries.
[**2106-4-15**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the
left atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focalities in the mid and apical anterior, anteroseptal,
inferoseptal walls. There is severe apical akinesis and apical
inferior and lateral walls as well. Rest of the segments are
mildly hyponetics. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed with an EF of 25%. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the thoraic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Note the low Cardiac output as the peak and mean gradients are
28 and 16mm of Hg only. No inotropes given pre bypass to see the
change in gradient with the increase in cardiac output due to
the severe coronary lesions. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion. Post_bypass: Patient is on
milrinone (0.25mcg/kg/min), epinephrine (0.02mcg/kg/min).
Thoracic aortic contour is preserved. Normal RV systolic
function. Mild improvement in the overall LV systolic function
to LVEF of 30%-35%. Mild MR. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 43404**] is seen well seated
in the native aortic positiion, with no leaks and a residual
mean gradient of 16mmof hg.
[**2106-4-20**] CXR: Questionable new loculated right basilar
pneumothorax status post chest tube removal with either
atelectasis or fluid within the fissure on the right. 2.
Slightly increased left pleural effusion with underlying
atelectasis/consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname 1391**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for surgical care. She underwent the routine pre-operative
testing. A dental consult was performed given the planned aortic
valve replacement. On her pre-op chest x-ray there was a new
diffuse haziness over the right hemithorax consistent with a
moderate pleural effusion. She also underwent chest CT which
revealed a right breast skin thickening with retro areolar mass.
The thoracic and pulmonary services were [**Hospital1 4221**] for effusion
drainage and a breast surgery consult was obtained secondary to
new right breast findings. Her effusion was negative for
malignant cells. Medical management was continued for several
days prior to surgery and was treated for UTI with antibiotics.
She was cleared for surgery by thoracic and breast surgical
services. She will resume her close observation at [**Hospital1 25157**] for her history of breast cancer. On [**2106-4-15**] she
was taken to the operating room where she underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to three vessels and aortic valve
replacement with a tissue prosthesis. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Within 24 hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. She
required inotropic support for several days which was eventually
weaned off. Beta blockers and diuretics were started and she was
gently diuresed towards he pre-op weight. Chest tubes were
removed on post-op day two and epicardial pacing wires on
post-op day four. Do to a rising creatinine her diuretics were
stopped on post-op day four. On post-op day five she was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. As her
creatinine stabilized, low dose diuretics were resumed given her
peripheral edema and preoperative daily requirement of 80mg
daily. Her electrolytres and renal function will be followed at
rehab and her dose will be adjusted based on her volume status.
The physical therapy service was [**Date Range 4221**] for assistance with
her postoperative strength and mobility. Ciprofloxacin w
