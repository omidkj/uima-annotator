History of Present Illness:
HPI: 75F with PMH HTN admitted to CCU after cath.  Pt initially
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after presenting at [**Hospital **] hospital on
[**2174-7-8**] with weakness x 3 days, sudden onset SOB.  EMT found pt
to have SVT to 180's which spontaneously reverted to sinus in
ambulance. At [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], pt had another episode of SVT that
broke with 6 mg adenosine.  [**7-8**] dep in V3-V6. Pt
ruled on for MI with peak trop 5.67 and peak CK 200.  On [**7-9**]
EKG showed additional TWI in II, III, and F.  Pt was started on
heparin and integrellin gtts, which were D/C'd [**7-11**] [**2-23**] vaginal
bleed.  Vaginal US negative.  Taken to cath at [**Hospital1 **] [**7-11**]:
3VD occ prox RCA which fills by collaterals (appears chronic) Lg
OM1 off LCx new occlus, elongated mid LAD occ, increased PA
pressure, increased SVR, and global HK.  Milrinone gtt was
started.  TTE [**7-8**]: EF 10-20%, RV dilated and HK, severe global
HK. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation by CT [**Doctor First Name **] for CABG.
.
CT [**Doctor First Name **] evaluated pt and felt not appropriate for surgery given
new dx CLL, recent vaginal bleed, poor LV fn, and Cr of 1.4.
.
Taken to cath at [**Hospital1 18**] [**7-14**] for high risk intervention.

LMCA: mild diff dz
LAD: elongated 70-90% stenosis over middle third of vessel
LCx: Occ OM1 with faint collaterals
RCA: occ at ostium, filling with L to R collagerals from LAD
Cyper stents to LCx-OM and LAD.
Afib developed prior to start of procedure, given lopressor.
Significant PVD: no angioseal.

Pertinent Results:
Admitting labs were significant for a CK of 51, which trended
upwards to a peak of 211 on [**2174-7-15**], before trending down to 138
at discharge.
creatinine of 1.5, hct of 36.9. CK-MB peaked at 22 on [**2174-7-15**],
then trended down to 8 at discharge. Troponin was 0.41 at
admission, peaking at 0.94 on [**7-15**] before decreasing to 0.67 at
discharge.

Hct was 37.4 on admission, and dropped to 33.1 by discharge.
Creatinine was 1.5 on admission, and gradually fell to 1.2 by
discharge.


Brief Hospital Course:
75F with hx HTN admitted with ant NSTEMI and found to have 3VD
at [**Hospital1 **], transferred for high risk cath: s/p stent to LAD
and LCx-OM1 on [**7-14**].
Pt was started on Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID (switched to
carvedilol 6.25mg PO bid the next morning), ASA 325 mg PO qD,
Plavix 75 mg PO qD (loaded with 300 mg in cath lab), captopril
6.25 mg PO TID (gradually increased to 25mg PO tid), and
atorvastatin 80mg PO qD. Given EF of [**11-10**]% and global HK,
considered anti-coagulation with heparin or coumadin, but did
not do so due to bleeding during hospital stay.

OSH reported vaginal bleeding after starting integrillin. Pelvic
U/S was normal, and pt refused pelvic exam. Since admission to
CCU, has been guiac positive on all stools. Hct has been stable,
and pt was told to f/u with PCP for outpatient colonoscopy.

Initial and [**7-15**] CXR consistent with pulmonary edema with
bilateral pleural effusions.

Ms. [**Known lastname 6512**] experienced episodes of a-fib in cath lab, and
continued to flip between sinus and afib in the CCU until
converting back to sinus during the evening of [**7-14**].

Pt was in ARF on admission to CCU, with Cr 1.4, and 2.2 on
transfer from OSH. Baseline 1.1. She was treated with mucomyst
and bicarbonate IVF, and monitored closely. She gradually
recovered, with creatinine dropping to 1.2 by discharge.

Urine cultured Alpha strep and lactobacillus at OSH, pt admitted
on Ciprofloxacin. Changed to 7 days of levofloxacin 250mg PO qd
for better alpha strep coverage.

Ms. [**Known lastname 32185**] pre-existing hypertension continued to be managed
with the use of beta blockers and ACEIs.

An atypical CBC differential at OSH led to a new diagnosis of
CLL. Heme Onc consulted, and reported the following:

"Impression: The patient may have very early CLL. Her increased
retics, LDH, and bilirubin may indicate the presence of
hemolysis. Plan includes ordering flow studies on her
lymphocytes along with
Coombs testing. If this is stage zero CLL, no treatment is
indicated at the present time, although Coombs positive
hemolytic
anemia, if present, may need treatment."

Flow cytometry supported this dx, with CD519+, CD23+, FMC7-, and
CD20dim.
