Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness and syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 yo man with a  history of CAD, nonischemic
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% and ICD, DM,
recent admission for decompensated CHF, who is transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] for initial complaint of weakness and
subsequent VT storm.
.
This afternoon, the patient reported sudden onset of
lightheadedness followed by a fall, striking his head but
without LOC.  He called EMS.  On transfer to the stretcher, his
AICD fired.  It subsequently fired 4 more times within 30
minutes.  He was initially taken to an OSH and thought to be in
a paced rhythm.  It fired a fifth time there, at which time he
was started on an amiodarone bolus of 150mg IV and started on a
1mg/min gtt.  He was later given a second amiodarone bolus of
150mg IV.  OSH Labs notable for hyponatremia to 122 and
hypokalemia to 3.1.  He received K 40mEq po, Mg 2gm IV.  He also
received morphine 4mg IV, ativan 1mg IV x 2, and 1 inch of nitro
paste, then transferred to our ED.
.
On ED arrival, VS were: P 105, 116/82, RR 20, O2sat 92% on RA.
EKG showed a wide paced rhythm.  He had a transient episode of
VF with a sixth firing, then conversion back to sinus.  He was
given K 40mEq po and 40mEq IV and continued on the amiodarone
gtt.  Interrogation of his ICD confirmed the 6 firings today as
well as an additional firing each on [**1-21**] and [**1-23**] which the
patient did not recall.  He also has increasingly been ATP paced
out of VT/VF since the end of [**Month (only) **]/beginning of [**Month (only) 1096**].
BNP 5317.  His CXR showed fluid overload.  Lasix 120mg IV was
given with UOP of 350 cc within an hour.  A NCHCT was done given
his fall on coumadin; no acute intracranial findings were seen.
VS on transfer: P 96, BP 94/69, RR 23, O2sat 98 on 3LNC.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to our CCU from
[**Date range (1) 87244**] after undergoing coronary angiography at LGH and
being found to have a tight RCA lesion and occlusion of a large
OM.  The cath was complicated by hemodynamic instability and
acute pulmonary edema requiring transfer here.  Echo showed
severe global hypokinesis with regional variation and mild AS.
He was in afib and VT during his hospital course and was shocked
by his defibrillator multiple times, so he underwent AV nodal
ablation followed by a BiV pacer upgrade. He also underwent
successful rotablation of the large RCA with IABP support
intraop; attempt to open the OM was unsuccessful.  His
hemodynamics improved and patient was aggressively diuresed with
improvement in his CHF.  He was initially discharged on
torsemide, but since his discharge from rehab, he has been on
lasix 160mg [**Hospital1 **], which he felt has been more efficacious.  He
denies any dyspnea on exertion; no orthopnea (1-pillow), PND,
edema.  He saw his cardiologist 1 week ago, at which time he was
noted to be hypokalemic.  He was started on potassium 60mEq [**Hospital1 **]
although as noted above, K was low on presentation.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations.

=============================Imaging======================
Head CT:
FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or evidence of
recent
infarction is seen. Prominence of the ventricles and sulci
reflects a mild
degree of generalized atrophy. Incidental note is made of a
cavum septum
pellucidum. No concerning osseous lesion or fracture is
identified. The
visualized paranasal sinuses are grossly unremarkable. There are

calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons.
.
IMPRESSION: Motion degraded study; however, no evidence of acute
intracranial process seen.
.
CXR:
FINDINGS: The heart is enlarged with new pleural effusions,
right greater
than left. Mild pulmonary edema and vascular congestion are new.
No
pneumothorax is seen. A left-sided pacemaker appears in
unchanged position
though evaluation of the leads is limited due to overlying
wires.

IMPRESSION: Recurrent congestive heart failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
60yo M w/ CAD, CHF with an EF of 16% s/p ICD w/ recent upgrade
to BiV, DM, AF on coumadin transferred from OSH after
unwitnessed fall at home, now s/p multiple shocks related to VT
storm.
.
# Ventricular Tachycardia: Hypokalemic on admission. On transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**] interrogation of his ICD confirmed the 6 firings on the
day of admission as well as an one firing on [**1-21**] and [**1-23**]
which the patient did not recall. Also noted that he has been
ATP paced out of VT/VF for the past 2 months. On admission, he
was demand paced. Likely entered VT in the setting of
hypokalemia with known arryhtmogenic substrate given cardiac
history. He was loa
