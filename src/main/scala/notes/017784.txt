[**2163-8-29**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
Bilateral 1-39% ICA stenosis. Bilateral vertebral antegrade
flow.

[**2163-9-5**] ECHO
Prebypass

1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2163-9-5**] at 930am.

Post bypass

1. Patient is being AV paced .
2. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
3. Mitral regurgitation is 2+
4. Bioprosthetic va;lve seen in the aortic position. Leaflets
move well and the valve appears well seated. Peak gradient
across the aortic valve is 17 mm Hg.
5. Aorta intact post decannulation.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 40009**] was transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital to the
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2163-8-26**] for definitive surgical treatment of her aortic
stenosis and coronary artery disease. She underwent routine
preoperative testing including a carotid duplex ultrasound which
showed bilateral 1-39% internal carotid artery stenosis. She had
a brief episode of CP after admission which resolved without
intervention. Herpes zoster was noted on exam for which
acyclovir was started. An infectious disease consult was
obtained who obtained a culture which was positive for herpes
simplex virus type 2 and agreed with antiviral treatment.
Augmentin was started for moraxella catarrhalis in her sputum.
On [**2163-9-5**], Ms. [**Known lastname 40009**] was taken to the operating room where
she underwent an aortic valve replacement (porcine valve) and
coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessel. Please see
operative not for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the
cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. She was
later extubated without difficulty. Her vasoactive drips were
weaned and her chest tubes removed.  She was transferred to the
step down floor.  Her wires were removed. [**9-10**] she was
ambulating well, her sternal wound was improved. She will be
discharged today on keflex for 5 days.
