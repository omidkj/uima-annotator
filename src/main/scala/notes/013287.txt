HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
woman with a history of smoking and without other risk
factors for coronary artery disease who was transferred for
[**Hospital6 204**].

The patient was in her usual state of health until 1 p.m. on
the day of admission when while cooking she experienced a
bilateral shoulder ache with radiation to her epigastrium.
This was associated with nausea and diaphoresis.  She denied
shortness of breath or palpitations.

At the [**Hospital6 204**] Emergency Department, the
patient was found to have anterior ST elevations in leads V2
through V4 on her electrocardiogram.  She was treated with
intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin; after which her blood
pressure fell from 120/55 to 58/38 which was resolved to a
systolic blood pressure in the 80s with dopamine treatment.
She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] to the Coronary Care Unit.  It should also be noted
that she was thrombolysed at [**Hospital6 204**].

The patient denied chest pain on arrival to [**Hospital1 346**], and it was unclear as to when the
chest pain resolved.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Question of cerebrovascular accident with lacunar
infarction.
2.  Hypertension in the past but not for about six years.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 100-pack-year smoking
history and is still smoking.  She denies alcohol or drug
use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  A sister passed away for a myocardial
infarction in her 50s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 95.8
degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 82/54, her heart
rate was 90, and her respiratory rate was 19.  General
physical examination revealed the patient appeared pale.  The
lung examination was normal.  Cardiovascular examination was
normal.  The extremities were cool but without edema.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed a
sinus rhythm at 78 beats per minute with Q waves in V1 and
V2.  There were 1-mm ST elevations in V1, and 2-mm ST
elevations in V2 through V4, and 1-mm ST elevations in leads
in I and aVL.  She was also noted later to have an
accelerated junctional rhythm with continued ST elevations in
leads V2 through V4.  Later on, she had Q waves in V1 through
V5, I, and aVL with continued ST elevations in V2 through V5.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
white blood cell count was 17.6, her hematocrit was 43, and
her platelets were 246.  Creatine kinase was around 3000 with
a troponin of 16.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ISSUES:  The patient
was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit and taken initial to
the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for persistent
hypotension on arrival which revealed a pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 30.  She had a 99% lesion of the left
anterior descending artery which was stented, and a 90%
lesion to the right coronary artery which was stented, and a
60% lesion in the first obtuse marginal which was stented.
There were no acute events after return from the
Catheterization Laboratory.

The patient required a blood transfusion of 1 unit of packed
red blood cells.  She was continued on a heparin drip.  She
was started on Plavix 75 mg by mouth and aspirin.  She was
also started on captopril, metoprolol, and Lipitor.

The patient initially returned from the Catheterization
Laboratory with an intra-aortic balloon pump which was
discontinued soon after her return to the Coronary Care Unit.

The patient returned to the Catheterization Laboratory two
days later for stenting of her right coronary artery and her
left circumflex artery.  She was hemodynamically stable
throughout her cardiac catheterization.

It should be noted that on telemetry the patient had some
episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and short
runs of bigeminy.  However, she was without chest pain
throughout the entire hospitalization.

An echocardiogram done following all the interventions
revealed overall left ventricular systolic function was
moderately depressed with regional wall motion abnormalities;
including akinesis at the apex, anteroseptal, and anterior
walls.  A small patent foramen ovale was noted to be present.
Her ejection fraction was 35% to 40%.

The patient continued to be heparinized secondary to her low
ejection fraction and was initiated on Coumadin.  The patient
was unable to tolerate a beta blocker secondary to a low
blood pressure; however, she was continued on aspirin,
Plavix, Lipitor, and lisinopril.

Given the abnormalities on telemetry, there was a question of
whether or not the patient would need implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator placement in the future.  She was
to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one month for an
Electrophysiology study.

2.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient was noted to be anemic
during her hospitalization with an unknown etiology.
Hemolysis laboratories were negative.  A computed tomography
of the pelvis was negative for bleeding and guaiac was
negative.   She was to continue to have her hematocrit levels
checked [**Hospital1 **]-weekly to verify stability and was encouraged to
have an outpatient gastroenterology workup.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post inferior myocardial
infarction.
2.  Anemia of unknown etiology.

MAJOR SURGICAL/INVASIVE PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Cardiac
catheterization with stent placement on [**12-14**] and
[**12-16**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
4.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Lisinopril 12.5 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Coumadin 5 mg by mouth at hour of sleep (with possible
adjustments based on INR).
7.  Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously q.12h. (to be continued
until INR is therapeutic with a goal of greater than 2).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow up with her primary
care doctor (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4154**] on [**2141-1-5**].
2.  The patient was instructed to follow up with her new
cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) on [**2141-1-2**].
3.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one month for an electrophysiology study.
4.  The patient was instructed to have her INR and hematocrit
levels drawn by the [**Hospital6 407**] services.
5.  The patient was instructed to continue on a cardiac
healthy diet with low sodium.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.
