Admission Date:  [**2120-6-10**]       Discharge Date:[**2120-7-3**]

Date of Birth:   [**2052-2-14**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MEDICAL IC

NOTE:  The following is an admission history and physical as
noted on [**2120-6-10**] by the Medical Intensive Care Unit
[**Male First Name (un) **] Resident, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2398**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old woman
with the past medical history of coronary artery disease,
stent in [**2112**], diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic renal
failure, peripheral vascular disease, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation status post cardioversion a month ago,
hypothyroidism and CHF with diastolic dysfunction and a
preserved ejection fraction of 60%.  The patient was
transferred to the MICU Service for progressively worsening
dyspnea.  Of note:  The patient was recently admitted to the
[**Hospital1 69**] in [**2120-5-6**] for
shortness of breath.  The patient was treated at that time
for presumed CHF and also for a pneumonia with Levofloxacin
and eventually discontinued to [**Hospital3 4419**]
Center.  Per report, the patient was aggressively diuresed to
keep a weight less than 205 pounds.  At [**Hospital1 1319**], the
diuresis was discontinued several days prior to presentation
in the setting of increasing BUN and creatinine.
Furthermore, at rehabilitation, the patient completed a
course of Levofloxacin and was started on a course of
Vancomycin for a question of pneumonia.

The patient present to [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department earlier this morning with the above
story and several days of fevers, scratchy cough productive
of sputum and in acute respiratory distress with oxygen
saturations down to 88% on room air.  The patient was treated
in the emergency room with 20 mg of IV Furosemide,
Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and nebulizers.  These antibiotics
were continued on the floor.  The patient's respiratory
status, however, continued to decline during the course the
day and, therefore, she was transferred ICU for closer
management.  According to the primary medical doctor,
Dr.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], the patient normally is not short of
breath when her weight is kept less than 220 pounds.  In the
past, she has actually been diuresed to a creatinine of 2.0
with good results.

With regard to the patient's pulmonary status, there is a
concern for primary pulmonary process given the CT scan in
[**Month (only) 547**], which although consistent with CHF, could point to an
atypical pneumonia, such as eosinophil pneumonia or an
inflammatory process such as bronchiolitis obliterans
organizing pneumonia (BOOP).

Given these concerns, the patient's Amiodarone was
discontinued one week prior to presentation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The following hospital course is as noted
by [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], M.D., PHD:

Mrs. [**Known lastname 105375**] has had a complicated hospital course.  From a
systematic analysis the patient's problems include:

PULMONARY:  The patient's respiratory status on admission to
the MICU was tenuous, however, she was able to maintain
adequate ventilation without intubation initially.  The
clinical presentation was most consistent with congestive
heart failure and, therefore, the patient would diuresis with
Furosemide and over the course of several days, she was
negative 12 liters. however, the oxygen requirement did not
improve and the chest x-ray did not significantly change.  A
followup CT to evaluate progression of the previous CT noted
in [**Month (only) 547**] was performed during this hospitalization.  It
revealed significant progression of previously-described
ground-glass opacification and consolidation throughout all
lung zones.  There is a persistent diffuse bronchial-wall
thickening and furthermore, there is a persistent prominent
mediastinal lymph node, but not significantly changed in size
and appearance from the previous examination in [**Month (only) 547**].  Given
the repetitive progression, this is felt most consistent with
CHF.  However, given that the patient was sufficiently
diuresed from admission weight of 104 kg to 88 kg loosing 12
liters of fluid and with continued respiratory distress we
most entertain other etiologies for this pulmonary status,
which include multifocal pneumonia or more likely BOOP.  To
further work this up, the patient underwent bronchoscopy and
VATS procedure.  The patient was intubated for better
management of her airway in the setting of these procedures
and the fact that she continued to be tachypneic with a
marginal ventilatory status.  The VATS procedure with wedge
biopsy revealed and organizing pneumonitis with focal
intra-alveolar fibrin deposition, which were consistent with
BOOP.

Given these findings the patient was started on Solu-Medrol
100 mg IV q.6.  The patient showed slow improvement on
steroids and the chest x-ray improved gradually during the
course of the hospitalization.  By the time of this
dictation, the nodular pattern seen on chest x-ray had
essentially resolved.  The patient's breathing improved and
the patient was successfully extubated.  At the time of this
dictation, she was not requiring supplemental oxygen,
maintaining saturations in the low to mid 90s.  The
Solu-Medrol was discontinued and Prednisone 60 mg p.o.q.d.
was started for the patient's BOOP.  The intention was to
continue this treatment for six months.  One could, however,
make the argument for a tapering course within the next
couple of months.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient continued to have
temperature spikes up to as high as 105 despite being on
appropriate therapy for BOOP.  An extensive workup was done
to evaluate the source of her fever.

Initial blood cultures were negative and ultrasound of the
right upper quadrant did
