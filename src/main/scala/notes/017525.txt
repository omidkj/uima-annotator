Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo woman who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2161-4-22**] with cough and
decreased mental status. In the ED, she had an episode of
emesis, found to be hypertensive, hypoxic to 60s, diuresised,
given Levofloxacin, and started on nitro drip. Of note, CXR in
ED was without pneumonia though subsequent to the episode of
emesis, CXR's with opacity. On arrival to the MICU pt was
hypotensive and bradycardic, resolution on hypotension with
titration off of the nitro drip.
.
In the MICU pt was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and
treated with levofloxacin and flagyl. On her second night in the
MICU she had an episode of staring consistent with seizure
activity. Neurology was consulted, felt that episode was likely
seizure and recommended discontinuing Levofloxacin and flagyl
which decrease seizure threshold, titrating up [**Name (NI) **] (pt on
this at home), and prn ativan for future spells. Since that
episode there was no further seizure.
.
In review of medical history leading up to admission, pt
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**3-2**] with shortness of breath but no
evidence of pneumonia or CHF and was discharged to rehab. She
was diagnosed with a UTI at rehab and completed a course of
treatment. On [**2161-4-10**], she was discharged from rehab to home.
Several days prior to admission, the patient noted dysuria and
her VNA checked a UA that, by report, was consistent with a UTI
as well. As a result, the patient's PCP placed her on Cipro for
which she received one dose prior to presentation. On day of
admission her niece noted that the patient overnight had
increased coughing and ?shortness of breath. The niece was
afraid she might have aspirated (she had not been eating at the
time). The patient denied any chest pain. She did, however,
develop a productive-sounding cough with no sputum. Of note, the
niece noted that the patient also may have had difficulty
swallowing full tablets recently.
.
On the day of admission, the patient then complained of nausea
with mild, diffuse abdominal pain. She had no fevers or chills
at home. One of her home health aides had been sick but did not
come to work recently (1 week ago).
.
In addition, the patient's niece notes that she has had a change
in her mental status on the day prior to presentation. At
baseline, she is interactive with a microphone and headset (hard
of hearing) but today, her mental status is depressed and she is
not very interactive.
.
Currently pt complains only of cough. Denies fever, chest pain,
abdominal pain. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN in ICU no diarhea, pt had wone BM in past
24 hours.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o prior stroke, HTN, CHF EF > 55%,
admitted with ?chf, aspiration pneumonia, change in mental
status, now all resolving.
.
1. Hypoxia: multifactorial. Aspiration right middle lobe PNA and
possible flash PE were likely culprits. She was initially
treated with levofloxacin and flagyl but given seizure activity
(see below), this was changed to IV clindamycin. Patient
clinically improved on this medication and was changed to PO
augmentin several days prior to her discharge. Her last day of
augmentin (to complete a 14 day total antibiotic course is
[**2161-5-4**]). Of note, DFA was negative for influenza.  Sputum
culture was also unrevealing. At the time of discharge, patient
is on low flow oxygen with daily improvement. Sputum production
has lessened.
.
2. aspiration: treated for pneumonia as above. Had speech and
swallow evaluation twice during hospitalization and was felt
safe for thin liquids. GERD thought to be a large component of
her aspiration so high dose PPI with lansoprazole liquid [**Hospital1 **] was
started. Scopolamine patch also helped secretions somewhat. She
was on aspiration precautions with head of bed at >30 degrees at
all times. Speech pathology recommended crushing all meds.
.
2. Leukocytosis. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain initially in
ED were nonspecific. KUB did not show obstruction. LFTs were
unrevealing. RUS did not show any evidence of acute cholangitis.
PNA remains most likely etiology.  Resolved.
.
3. Low UO - Patient was found to have low UO at the start of her
admission.  Ulytes showed FeNa 0.4%, Osm 516, she was given IVF
boluses and her output improved. No active issues upon
discharge.
.
4. Absence seizure - patient has h/o of seizures that appears to
have previously occured in a setting of her stroke, appears to
have had an episode AM on [**4-23**] -> ativan 0.5 IV x 1, appears to
have stopped the spell.  Neurology service was consulted and
recommended switching levoquin to other antibiotics.  Her
[**Month/Year (2) 74959**] was also increased to 300 mg PO BID. EEG [**4-24**]- showed
only mild encephalopathy and no epileptiform features. Levaquin
was added to her allergy list since it seemed to lower her
seizure threshold.
.
5. CHF, EF >55% : no evidence of vol overload on exam. given 80
mg Iv lasix in ED with good UO. Patient appears to be dry after
the lasix with low UO. She received several IVF boluses while in
the unit and tolerated themm well.  Patient UO improved and she
was restarted on her home dose of Lasix 20 mg QD as she appeared
euvolemic.
.
6. HTN: HTN urgency while in ED [**2-26**] aggitation. Also did not
recieve home
