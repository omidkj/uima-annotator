Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurring pleural effusions

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis
VATS


History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old female with past medical history of
anxiety/depression, who is being transferred from [**Hospital3 417**]
for recurrent pleural effusions. She was admitted [**12-30**] to the
OSH with SOB, pleuritic chest pain, and throat/tongue
discomfort.
.
She initially presented to OSH ED on [**12-29**] w/ throat pain, a
strep swab was done and was negative. The patient was sent home
w/ clindamycin that she did not take given an allergy history.
She returned to the ER the subsequent day [**12-30**] w/ pleuritic
chest pain, subjective fever, dysphagia and throat pain. CTA was
done that ruled out PE. She was admitted and treated for CAP w/
timentin. Her pain was hard to control and required toradol and
morphine.
.
During her hospital course she was hypoxic requiring oxygen. She
was found to have bl pleural effusion, and thoracic sx performed
thoracentesis of the effusions. [**Female First Name (un) **] revealed exudative
effusion, w/ negative gram stain, afb neg, neg cytology. A CT of
the neck was done for her neck swelling (per patient) and
incidentally showed 2x1cm mass at base of tongue. ENT evaluated
patient and recommended MRI was suggested but patient could not
tolerate this. Her hospital course was further complicated by
persistent leukocytosis, low grade fevers, tachycardia, with
occasional episodes of [**1-11**] run of VT. From OSH records it is
unclear when abx regimen was switched but patient was started on
levo/ceftriaxone. Cardiology was consulted and echo was done
that showed trivial pericardial effusion, tele sig for sinus
tach, and so patient was started on metoprolol. TSH was checked
and was normal. CT of chest was repeated given persistent tachy
which was negative for PE but sig for recurrent bl pleural
effusions and in light of tongue mass the primary team was
concerned for possible malignancy. Plan was to possible retap or
thoracoscopic drainage and pleurodesis by thoracic surgery, but
patient requested to be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Prior to transfer her VS at OSH were notable for Tmax 100.6, HR
130s SBP 180s, 95% RA.
.
Currently patient states that her chest pain has improved and is
throughout on right/left, worse on inspiration. She also
describes back pain that is worse on inspiration. Her throat
swelling has subsided. She states that her dysphagia and throat
pain has also improved. She has been able to tolerate a po diet.
She continues to feel short of breath at times, and uses
supplemental oxygen for relief. She denies any weight loss or
fevers/chills throughout the few months prior to this admission.
Of note she is a nonsmoker.

TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad. There is borderline right ventricular
diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology.

PATHOLOGY (Pleural biopsy)

I)  Pleural debris (A-B):

Fibrin with organization and acute inflammation.

II)  Pleura, biopsy (C-D):

Pleura with granulation tissue and organizing fibrin.

MRI neck:
1. No mass noted at the base of the tongue. No lymphadenopathy
within the
head or neck.
2. Motion degraded images but no gross abnormality of the
visualized lungs or arterial vessels noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old female with past medical history of
anxiety/depression, transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] for
recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, question of b/l pna,
radiographic evidence of possible tongue mass for further
management.
.
Pleural Effusion/Pleuritic Pain: CXR on admission sig for b/l
pleural effusion.  IP was consulted and performed a
thoracentesis. U/S showed loculated appearance of fluid.
Pleural fluid was consistent with exudative process, and in the
setting of polys/low pH/low glucose there was a concern for
complicated parapneumonic effusion.  Antibiotic coverage was
switched from Levaquin to Cipro/Zosyn/Vancomycin for broad
coverage with better lung penetration.  The patient underwent
VATS on the right effusion with chest tube placement.  Pathology
report revealed fibrin with organization and acute inflammation,
but was non-diagnostic.  Thorasic surgery service did not feel
that VATS was indicated on left side given symptomatic
improvement and stable radiographic findings.  Prior to
discharge, the patient was switched to oral antibiotic regimen
of Doxycycline 100mg twice daily, Levofloxacin 750mg daily and
Flagyl 500mg every 8 hours.  Chest tubes were capped with
Heimlich valves prior to discharge.  She will follow up with
thorasic surgery to have chest tubes removed.  She will also
follow up with Infectious Disease for antibiotic management.
Percocet PRN and Lidocaine patch were prescribed for pain
control.
.
Tongue Mass/Dysphagia: This was an incidental finding on CT of
neck at OSH. Per patient this was associated with neck swelling
which has since improved. From radiology imaging report there
was note of mild narrowing of the supraglottic airway with
scattered small nodes, without any comment on vasculature. There
was concern for possible malignancy, squamous cell vs lymphoma.
