Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with Balloon Angioplasty to distal right
coronary Artery.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68-year-old female with metastatic uterine cancer
diagnosed [**8-/2133**] s/p TAH, DM2, HTN who presents with acute
onset of substernal chest pain beginning this morning at 1AM.
The patient went to bed in her usual state of health and awoke
at 1AM with a substernal burning which she attributed to
heartburn. She tried to go back to sleep and was successful on
and off until 6AM when the pain increased from [**1-10**] to [**5-9**]. At
this point the pain was more of a tightness sensation. She had
some mild radiation to her left shoulder and had associated
nausea and diaphoresis. No vomiting or shortness of breath. She
called her granddaughter to come get her to bring her to [**Hospital1 18**].
She did not call 911 for fear that she would be brought to
another hospital.
.
In the ED, vital signs were HR 82, BP 220/115, RR 25. By the
time she arrived to the ED the pain was substernal pressure,
[**9-8**]. EKG showed ST elevations and cath lab was activated. She
was given ASA, IVF, plavix, heparin and integrillin. She was
taken to the Cath lab immediately, found to have TO of distal
RCA and underwent PTCA to distal RCA.
.
In terms of her oncologic history she initially presented with
abnormal uterine bleeding and underwent biopsy. She was
diagnosed with stage 1b lesion and underwent radiation. She was
subsequently found to have a breast lesion and multiple
abdominal lesions consistent with endometrial biopsy. She was
started on [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol and completed cycle 6 on [**2135-9-29**]. She
was supposed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today.
.
Of note, the patient underwent cataract surgery 2 weeks ago
which was uncomplicated. At baseline she is able to ambulate [**12-2**]
mile without shortness of breath or chest pain.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient is comfortable. She feels
100% better, chest pain free. She arrives with sheath in place
in right groin. No complaints.


Past Medical History:
1. Hysterectomy for uterine cancer on [**2133-8-31**] treated with
[**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol.
2. History of pulmonary embolism for which she has completed her

Coumadin therapy.
3. Hypertension.
4. Diabetes.
5. History of keloids
6. Cataract surgery L eye 2 weeks ago
7. Bilateral PE [**2132**]
.
Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Hypertension
.
Cardiac History:
No history of CABG, ICD


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. Pt quit smoking 20 years ago; she used to smoke [**2-1**]
cigarettes daily. There is no history of alcohol abuse. She
drinks rare social EtOH.

C.CATH Study Date of [**2136-1-20**] 1.  Coronary angiography in this
right-dominant system revealed:
--the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD had a 60% stenosis at D1; D1 had a 60% origin
stenosis.
--the LCX had mild diffuse disease.
--the RCA was extremely tortuous with steep angulation, and had
a
proximal 50-60% stenosis with total occlusion distally.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right-sided filling
pressures with RVEDP 7 mmHg.  Pulmonary artery systolic
pressures were high-normal with PASP 27 mmHg.  The PCWP was
normal at 10 mmHg.  There was severe systemic arterial systolic
hypertension with SBP 177 mmHg.  The cardiac output was
preserved, with CI 2.6 L/min/m2. 3. Successful PTCA alone of the
distal RCA with a 2.0 x 15 and then a 3.0 x 12 mm voyager
balloon. Final angiography revealed a 30% residual stenosis in
the RCA, no dissection and TIMI III flow. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Acute inferior STEMI
2.  Two-vessel CAD with distal RCA occlusion 3.  Normal cardiac
output with normal right-sided filling pressures and high-normal
PA systolic pressures 4.  Systemic arterial systolic
hypertension. 5.  [**Name (NI) 28283**] PTCA of the distal RCA.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2136-1-20**] at 3:30:00 PM The left
atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
30-40 %) secondary to dyskinesis of the basal inferior posterior
wall and akinesis of the midventricular segments of the inferior
and posterior walls. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free
wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2133-10-27**], there is now left
and right ventricular contractile dysfunction.
