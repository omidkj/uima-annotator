Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
52M h/o dilated CM (EF 30-35% on [**2195-12-10**]), crack cocaine abuse
c/b crack pneumonitis, MRSA PNA, COPD, and Type I DM p/w
acute-onset SOB. He was in his USOH until the morning of
admission, when he developed SOB and nonradiating substernal
"chest tightness" x1h after ambulating to the couch, prompting
him to call EMS. He notes that the current episode is similar to
past episodes of DOE and chest tightness in the setting of crack
cocaine use; he last used cocaine and cigarettes on the evening
of [**2196-2-27**]. He endorses minimal wheeze on the evening PTA,
bilateral LE edema minimally increased from baseline, and stable
2-pillow orthopnea. He denies f/c/s, cough/URI symptoms,
pleuritic chest pain, PND, medication noncompliance, or recent
dietary indiscretion. He has no home O2 requirement.

Of note, he has had multiple admissions for SOB and chest
tightness in the setting of crack cocaine use and attributed to
crack pneumonitis, most recently [**Date range (1) 35039**]/12, during which time
he underwent aggressive diuresis for likely concomittant CHF
exacerbation and received empiric levofloxacin x7d and IV
solumedrol followed by a prednisone taper. He has required ICU
admission and BiPAP during previous admissions for crack
pneumonitis, including a stay concluding [**2196-2-3**].

In the ED, initial VS were as follows: 123, 136/82, 33, 100% on
BiPAP initiated by EMS. CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy
opacities with diffuse reactive inflammatory process. Following
discontinuation of BiPAP, he developed RR to 50s, prompting
resumption of BiPAP. He received 40 mg IV Lasix, with 400 cc UOP
in ED, and 325 mg ASA, and nitroglycerin gtt was initiated. When
he developed SBP to 80s, nitroglycerin gtt was discontinued.

On arrival to the MICU, he was weaned successfully to
nonrebreather at 100% FiO2, with ABG: 7.47/40/82. An additional
225 cc UOP was noted.

In the MICU, the patient was put on BIPAP and an ABG was
obtained which showed a respiratory alkalosis with a large A-a
gradient. He was given 1. steroids, 2. vanc,cefepime,azithro, 3.
and IV lasix for chest xray concerning for pulmonary edema.
After stabilization in the MICU, his supplemental oxygen was
weaned to where he was saturating 97% on 3L NC with no signs of
excess work of breathing. He was transferred from the MICU
denying chest pain and he was sitting in bed comfortably
watching TV while receiving his IV antibiotics.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the MICU, patient was treated with solumedrol, oxygen, and
lasix for presumed pneumonitis and CHF exacerbation.  He
improved and was transferred to the floor.

Upon transfer to the floor, the patient required supplemental
oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 92%. He was
hemodynamically stable with a sinus tachycardia in the high
90s-100s. The patient??????s antibiotics were discontinued as there
was no evidence that he had a bacterial pneumonia: no white
blood cell count, no fever, rapid improvement in symptoms with
steroids. Upon discontinuation of his antibiotics, he remained
afebrile. He was treated with supportive therapy for
crack-cocaine pneumonititis with nebulizers and a 4 day course
of oral prednisone. His hospitalization on the floor was
uneventful. He spent most of the day watching TV and talking on
the telephone. Each day his oxygenation improved until the day
of discharge where he was able to ambulate with a oxygen
saturation above 90%.

At that point, he was discharged with an appointment at the
[**Hospital1 **] Dual Diagnosis Partial Day Program on [**3-7*
