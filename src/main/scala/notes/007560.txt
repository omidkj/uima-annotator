Date of Birth:  [**2090-9-21**]        Sex:  F

Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 34-year-old woman
who was at work who had a sudden onset of bilateral ear
fullness followed by severe neck pain and nausea and
headache.  She was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where a head CT
showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination she has a
blood pressure of 135/91, heart rate 93, sats 100 percent on
room air, respiratory rate 20.  She has mild to moderate neck
pain.  Her cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm.  Her
abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Her lungs are clear to
auscultation.  She is awake, alert, and oriented times three.
Face is symmetric.  EOMs full.  No diplopia.  No nystagmus.
Tongue and palate rose symmetrically.  Hearing is intact.
Her strength is [**4-11**] in all muscle groups.  Sensation is
intact to light touch throughout.

LABORATORY DATA:  Head CT at the time of admission showed
diffuse subarachnoid around the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit, was given all neuro checks, and was taken to the Angio
Suite, underwent a diagnostic angiogram with coiling of an
ACOM aneurysm without complication.  Post angio patient was
awake, alert, and oriented, opening eyes to voice, following
commands.  Pupils are 3 down to 2 mm and briskly reactive.
EOMs were full with no nystagmus.  Face was symmetric.
Strength was [**4-11**] in all muscle groups.  She remained
neurologically stable and had a repeat angiogram done on
[**2125-7-9**] which showed no filling of the aneurysm.  The
procedure had no complications, and she was again monitored
in the Intensive Care Unit for close observation.  She also
had a vent drain in place that was placed at the time of
admission.

Repeat head CT on [**2125-7-8**] showed good coiling of the AC
aneurysm with decrease in hydrocephalus and size of the
subarachnoid.  Continued to remain in the Intensive Care Unit
with an ICP drain in place at a level 12 cm above the tragus.
She remained neurologically awake and alert, oriented times
3, following commands with no drift.  Smile was symmetric.
Tongue midline.  She remained in the Intensive Care Unit with
a blood pressure less than 150 and a labetalol drip.

On [**2125-7-10**] she had a repeat head CT on [**2125-7-9**] that
showed no significant change.  She remained in the Intensive
Care Unit with q. 1-hour neuro checks.

On [**2125-7-12**] she was started on albumin and Neo-Synephrine
for blood pressure support to prevent vasospasm.  Her vital
signs remained stable.  She remained neurologically intact.
She had TCDs started on [**2125-7-13**] that showed high
velocities.  She was scheduled for arteriogram on [**2125-7-13**].
Patient was started on triple H therapy on [**2125-7-13**] and
angiogram was put off, and patient spiked to 101.9 on
[**2125-7-17**].  Had gram negative rods in the cerebrospinal
fluid and she was started on vancomycin and ceftazidime.  She
was also given intrathecal gentamicin and had a repeat head
CT on [**2125-7-17**] that showed no significant change.  TCs
again show elevated velocities.  Patient remained on triple H
therapy and close neurologic monitoring in the Intensive Care
Unit.

On [**2125-7-18**] the patient had an angiogram that showed
vasospasm of the right internal carotid artery and MCA, right
greater than left.  The patient remained on triple H therapy.
Infectious Disease continued to follow the patient regarding
cerebrospinal fluid infection.  The patient was treated for
gram rod nosocomial meningitis with vancomycin and
ceftazidime.

On [**2125-7-19**] the patient had a lumbar drain placed and vent
drain was removed due to infection.  Intravenous gentamicin
was added to the antibiotic regime to prevent resistance.
The patient continued to have cultures positive for gram
negative rods in her cerebrospinal fluid and was continued on
ceftazidime and gentamicin intravenously.

Patient had repeat TCDs done on [**2125-7-23**] which again showed
high velocities in the right MCA and left MCA region.
Patient remained on triple H therapy.  Head CT done on
[**2125-7-23**] shows improving subarachnoid with right frontal
subacute infarct.  Head CT from [**2125-7-20**] also showed the
hypodensity in the right frontal lobe.

Patient had lower extremity Dopplers done on [**2125-7-25**] which
were negative for deep venous thrombosis.  Drain was raised
to just 20 cm above the tragus.  Patient was seen by the Pain
service for a severe headache.  She was started on gabapentin
and increased to 600 mg t.i.d. for neuropathic component of
the pain.  She also had tizanidine for spasms which was
added.  Patient also had an occipital nerve block done by the
Chronic Pain service with minimal  relief.  She continued on
Dilaudid patient-controlled analgesia, Neurontin, and
tizanidine.

On [**2125-7-27**] the patient-controlled analgesia was
discontinued and the patient was started on methadone 5 mg
p.o. t.i.d.  On [**2125-7-28**] triple H therapy was discontinued.
Patient was taken off nimodipine and albumin.  Antibiotics
changed to meropenem per Infectious Disease.  Patient
remained neurologically stable, awake, alert, and oriented
times 3, moving all extremities, good strength, no deficits.

On [**2125-7-30**] the vent drain was clamped.  On [**2125-8-1**] the
vent drain was removed.  Vital signs remained stable.  She
remained neurologically intact.  She had a repeat head CT on
[**2125-7-31**] that showed increased size of the ventricles but
no gross hydrocephalus.  Was transferred to the regular floor
on [**2125-8-3**].  She was in stable condition.  She was seen by
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy.  She remained on
methadone for pain control.  She was discharged on [**2125-8-4**]
in stable condition with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in 2 weeks.

MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1. Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
