Physical Exam:
VS - 96.0 BP 108/68 HR 80 RR 18 96%2L NC FS 131, WT 206.6
Gen: WDWN middle aged male in NAD. Oriented x3. Mood, affect
appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 10 cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RR, normal S1, S2. No m/r/g. No thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.
Chest: Bibasilar crackles, no wheezing or rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, distended, NT, +BS. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta
not enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits. +Fluid wave.
Ext: 2+ thigh edema, toe amputations on L and R foot,
non-palpable DP pulses, cool R foot (at baseline)

Pertinent Results:
Unilateral LE veins left [**2167-5-27**]
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and
pulse wave Doppler demonstrates the common femoral vein,
superficial femoral vein, and popliteal veins to demonstrate
normal flow with normal phasic respiratory variation. With the
exception of the distal superficial femoral vein, which was not
visualized well enough to compress, all other veins were
compressible. Note is made of multiple left inguinal lymph
nodes, the largest of which measures 2.3 x 0.7 x 1.2 cm, but
which demonstrate likely fatty hila, evidence of benignity.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in left lower extremity.
.
Art ext [**2167-5-29**]
IMPRESSION: Significant left tibial arterial disease.
Inability to identify Doppler signal in the left posterior
arterial level.\
COMPARISON: When compared to the exam performed on [**2164-12-27**],
there are no significant changes except for the fact that no
Doppler signal was identified in the left posterior tibial
arterial level.

Left foot xray: [**2167-5-29**]
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis. Status
post first digit amputation.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old male with past medical history of CAD s/p CABG,
congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic renal
insufficiency here with CHF exacerbation and left foot ulcer
.
Acute on Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: Patient
with low EF, and diastolic failure. He presented with SOB and
weight of 206 pounds from a dry weight  <200 per recent clinic
notes. He has edema to knees with clear lungs. ACS as cause for
the exacerbation was ruled out with cardiac markers x3. THe
patient was diuresed with IV lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **] for several days
with goal net negative 2L. Daily weights were taken and strict
i/o were monitored. Once he LE edema improved and weight
approached 200, his was switched back to his home dose of
torsemide 100mg qAM and 50mg qPM. He was continued on toprol XL
100mg [**Hospital1 **] and Digoxin 0.0625. Also of note patients oxygen
requirement improved with diuresis. Per patient, he is on 5L at
home; he required 1-2L after diuresis. Subsequent to the
vascular procedure c/b GIB, his diuretics were held. His home
torsemide was resumed prior to discharge.
.
Left Toe Ulcer/Claudication/PVD: Patient complaining of
claudication when walking and at rest. s/p 2 toe amputations.
Vascular was consulted. Pt's coumadin was held prior to going to
the OR, he was placed on a hep gtt with PTT goal 60-80 prior to
going to the OR. Vascular took pt to OR for angio on Tuesday per
results of NIAS: Significant left tibial arterial disease. He
underwent Left leg arteriogram and angioplasty with below-knee
popliteal anterior tibial arteries. His course was complicated
by a GIB in setting of his known GI AVMs.
.
GIB: Pt with known AVMs and known prior GIBs. Following
heparinization for the vascular procedure pt's PTT was
supratherapeutic, Hep was reversed with potamine. Pt
subsequently started to have BRBPR in addition to melena. Pt's
HCT also dropped. He was sent to the MICU for closer monitor. He
received 2 UPRBC while in the MICU, his HCT was stable at 34, he
had no further melena or hematochezia. Pt was instructed not to
resume coumadin per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], indefinately given high risk of
rebleeding. His ASA 81mg was resumed, tolerated well.

.
CAD: PAtient ruled out for ACS with cardiac enzymes negative x3.
s/p CABG. troponins at at baseline 0.18 and CKs are flat. ASA
325 mg, toprol 100BID, Simvastatin 10mg daily, however with G
