Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP on [**2124-2-3**]


History of Present Illness:
89 y/o female with PMH of COPD, CAD, CHF (EF>55%), HTN, DM, pAF,
silent aspirator, recent admission for SOB and new presumed
diagnosis of BOOB (on steroid taper) who is called out from MICU
where she was admitted for hypoxic respiratory distress
requiring BIPAP.
.
Initially presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab where she developed acute
SOB. VS at the time were: 168/100, p160s, rr30s, 89% RA. Treated
w/ Lasix 60mg PO + 60mg IV. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where VS on
presentation were t 100.6, p130s, 138/76, rr35, 98%NRB. She was
noted to have significant work of breathing. She was placed on
Bipap, which she tolerated well. ABG was 7.36/37/248 on BIPAP
5/5/1.0 after 2 hours. She was given asa, solumedrol 125mg IV
x1, ceftaz 2gm IV and flagyl 500mg IV. Of note, also had an
episode of AFib with AVR with HR in 130s, hemodynamically
stable, HR decreased to 100s after 10mg IV diltiazem.
Transferred to MICU where pt was attempted on trial off bipap.
Maintained off BIPAP and weaned down to 2L NC overnight.
Therefore called out to the floor the following day.

Radiology:
=========
[**2124-2-3**] CXR-
1. Continued right upper lobe consolidation. Worsening left
retrocardiac opacity.
2. Cardiac failure
.
[**2124-2-4**] CXR: There is cardiomegaly unchanged with small bilateral
pleural effusions, unchanged from [**2124-2-3**] with associated
bibasilar atelectasis. The right upper lobe opacity is unchanged
from [**2124-2-3**] allowing for differences in technique.
However, compared to [**2124-1-8**], there has been
improvement in the peripheral right upper lobe opacity.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 89 yo female with PMH COPD, CHF, ?BOOP, recurrent
admissions for SOB who presented with acute SOB and hypoxia
requiring BIPAP transiently in the MICU, now weaned off to 2L NC
with stable sats.
.
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Improved respiratory status, now
stable on 2L O2 via NC.  Most likely etilogy of event was
multifactorial from recurrent pneumonia, CHF (diastolic dysfn),
BOOP exacerbation.
-continue with cefpodoxime to finish total course of 7 days for
possible new PNA
-continue albuterol/atrovent nebs
-continue prednisone 10mg/day until pulmonary appt on [**2124-2-8**] for
further evaluation
-continue with strict I/O's (goal even), daily weights and lasix
prn to meet goal or depending on symptoms (shortness of breath,
etc)
.
2. UTI: on cefpodoxime. Final urine cx from [**2124-2-3**] shows MRSA,
but less than 100,000 colonies, so we are not covering for this
as patient is not bacteremic or febrile. Please recheck urine
analysis and culture in one week and f/u on results. Will see
[**Month/Day/Year **] for follow-up in 2 weeks. Given h/o urinary retention in
past, should keep in foley. If foley removed and patient not
voiding at rehab, bladder scan should be done and foley/straight
cath should be placed if residual>200 cc.
.
3. CHF: BNP elevated. Clinically slightly volume overloaded but
intravascularly depleted.  Given renal insufficiency and
respiratory stability will hold off on further diuresis. Already
-1.6 L out for LOS in the hospital.
-maintain even i's/o's
-strict I/O's, daily wts
-lasix prn symptoms and/or to meet goal as above
.
4. Afib: diltiazem and lopressor for rate control. [**Country **] score of
4. Not on coumadin. ASA 325mg for anti-coagulation.
.
5. CAD: cont statin, asa, bb
-holding ACEi in setting of elevated cr
.
6. Elevated Tn: likely tn leak in setting of CHF, renal
insufficiency
.
6. CRI: 1.7. baseline of 1.1-1.5. Hold nephrotoxic agents.
Renally dose meds. Monitor daily lytes.
.
7. DMII: cont glyburide. FS QID. SSI
.
8. Leukocytosis: Likely in setting of steroids. Trend WBC/T
curve. cont abx as above.
.
9. PPX: PPI, tylenol, bowel regimen, Hep SC
.

aspiration) - see dietary instructions as detailed in d/c
