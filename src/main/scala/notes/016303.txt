Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
Coughing up blood

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2165-6-7**] - VATS for lung Bx
[**2165-6-11**] - Renal Biopsy
[**2165-6-29**] - L Renal Arteriogram

History of Present Illness:
66F with history of HTN, CAD s/p CABG and mechanical [**Hospital3 9642**]
aortic valve 20 years ago on coumadin, recent +PANCA, presented
for admission for reversal of INR and observation for upcoming
lung biopsy for workup of potential Wegners diagnosis. Patient
was admitted on [**2165-6-5**] for complaints of a progressive severe
cough for 2 months with three days of coughing up blood tinged
mucus mixed in with some clots. OMR notes reveal anemia over
past month with recent transfusion on Thursday prior to
admission.
.
Per OMR notes she was undergoing routine echo of the heart when
an increased dilation of the aorta was noted.  A CT scan was
ordered which revealed a 4.8 cm thoracic aortic aneurysm.
However, in addition, bilateral lung nodules were seen.  PET CT
showed multiple bilateral FDG avid nodules. She was seen by
thoracic surgery for consideration of EBUS versus open lung
biopsy one month ago.  In the interim, a pANCA level came back
positive, along with an ESR of 115 and a newly discovered anemia
of 8.0, and she was seen by Rheumatology, who facilitated
elective admission to the hospital for further workup.
.
She was admitted to MICU for monitoring in setting of blood
loss, CXR appearance showing diffuse opacities, and concern for
hemoptysis.  She was transfused two unit pRBC on [**6-5**] & [**6-7**] for
decreasing HCT 21.1. Renal saw patient and noted: UA: 4+ blood,
2+ prot.  Urine microscopy: >50 WBC/hpf. >50 RBC/hpf -
isosormophic. ANCA +, ANTI-GBM pending. [**Doctor First Name **] +.  Rhumatology saw
patient and recommened 3 pulse doses before lung biopsy.  On
[**2165-6-7**], patient had video assisted thoracoscopic surgery, left
upper lobe wedge resection, patient successfully extubated.
Chest tube removed on [**6-8**] without complications. Patient was put
on 60mg PO prednisone daily after VATS.

.
MICRO DATA:
Blood Cultures, Urine Cultures negative.
Renal and lung biopsy negative for infectious agents
.
[**6-4**]: Confirmed diagnosis of anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody. [**Doctor Last Name **]-antigen is

a member of the [**Doctor Last Name **] blood group system. Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody is
clinically significant and capable of causing hemolytic
transfusion
reactions. In the future, the patient should continue to receive
[**Doctor Last Name **]-antigen negative products for all red cell transfusions.
Approximately 90% of ABO compatible blood will be [**Doctor Last Name **]-antigen
negative.
.
[**6-4**] CXR: Bilateral ill-defined perihilar opacities, may
represent alveolar hemorrhage. Differential considerations
include a diffuse infectious process.
.
[**6-5**] Renal US: 1. Increased renal cortex echogenicity consistent
with medical renal disease. 2. Moderately increased resistive
indices.
.
[**6-6**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF 65%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. A
bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**6-6**] Chest CT w/o contrast: 1. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass
opacities and consolidation are nonspecific. However, given the
clinical and laboratory data for this patient, they are most
consistent with widespread hemorrhage likely secondary to
Wegener's granulomatosis or other vasculitis. The extent of
involvement has increased since [**2165-5-8**], but the right lower
lobe superior segment appears improved. 2. Prosthetic aortic
valve with dilatation of the ascending aorta to 4.8 cm,
unchanged from [**2165-4-25**]. 3. Possible calcified right renal
artery pseudoaneurysm, less likely calcified lymph node anterior
to the right kidney.
.
Wedge biopsies of lung, three (see note):
.
I.  Left lower lobe segment superior segment:
a)  Lung tissue with recent hemorrhage and focal organizing
alveolar fibrin.
b)  Focal capillaritis.
c)  Focal organizing pneumonitis.
d)  No large vessel vasculitis.
.
II.  Anterior left upper lobe:
a)  Lung tissue with recent hemorrhage and focal organizing
alveolar fibrin.
b)  Focal capillaritis.
c)  Focal organizing pneumonitis.
d)  No large vessel vasculitis.
.
III.  Posterior segment, left upper lobe:
a)  Lung tissue with recent hemorrhage and focal organizing
alveolar fibrin.
b)  Focal organizing pneumonitis.
c)  No large vessel vasculitis.
.
Note:  Case was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **] on [**2165-6-8**].  The
findings are not specific.  The typical findings of Wegener's
granulomatosis are not seen.  The diagnosis of Goodpasture
syndrome should be considered
