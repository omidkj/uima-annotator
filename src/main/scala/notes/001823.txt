Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/extubation


History of Present Illness:
78 y/o M w/complicated med hx who was in his USOH this evening
when his granddaughter found him downstairs confused, gasping
for breath, and "shaking".  His daughter ran down there and she
wasn't sure if he was seizing or not.  He is on 1-2L home O2 at
baseline, and per the daughter his o2 sat is usually between
90-92%.  His O2 sat at that time was in the 70s and per the
daughter he had rales to the apex on the left.  She gave him
lasix 40 po and called EMS.  When they arrived, he was in
respiratory distress, with bp 190/110, p 135, rr 36, 86% on an
unclear amt of oxygen.  His FS was initally 90, the daughter
gave him some glucose tablets, and it went down to 75.  EMS gave
him lasix 80 mg iv, an amp of D50 and brought him here.  While
en route, he vomited in the ambulance and aspirated.
.
In the ED, he was febrile to 103.8, tachycardic in the
110s-130s, tachypneic in the 30s-40s.  He was 84% on NRB and was
intubated.  He was started on a nitro gtt and propofol, but
became hypotensive to the 70s/50s and the nitro was
discontinued.  He had 825 cc UOP while downstairs.  He also
received etomidate 20 mg iv, succinylcholine 120 mg iv, aspirin
600 mg pr, tylenol, and levofloxacin 500 mg iv.  Post-intubation
he had no difficulties oxygenating, and he was transferred
upstairs to the MICU.
.
On review of systems with his daughter, he had been in his USOH
earlier today, running errands.  Because he is on home O2 and
has a poor pulmonary baseline, he does not walk far, but this
had not been getting worse recently.  He did recently finish
Pulmonary Rehab at the [**Hospital1 **] which was not helpful.  He had
not c/o chest pain, SOB, cough, weakness, vomiting, or abd pain.
 His daughter thinks he has chronic abd pain from his diabetic
neuropathy but that he describes this as nausea, although he
hadn't been vomiting.  Of note the pt's wife, who lives at home
with them, has bronchitis and is on abx.

IMAGING:
[**4-11**] CXR - Near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax
consistent with completed pneumonectomy or collapse of
postoperative right lung, unchanged from studies dating back
[**2182**]. Persistent left lower lobe peribronchial infiltrate
consistent with atelectasis with fibrosis or possibly pneumonia.
.
[**4-11**] CXR - There has been interval placement of an endotracheal
tube approximately 5 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube is
also seen with tip overlying the stomach. Otherwise, no
significant change is seen from prior study.
.
[**4-11**] EKG -
Sinus tachycardia, rate 138. Since the previous tracing of
[**2184-12-22**] the heart rate is faster. Some technical artifacts are
present. There has been an axis shift to the left. An RSR'
pattern is present in lead V1. The QRS complex is somewhat
widened. No other changes are seen.

.
[**4-13**] CXR - Tip of the ETT is in similar position and the NGT
appears to be in the antrum of the stomach. Slight patchiness at
the left lower lung is subtly more dense compared to the prior
study, the remainder of the left lung is clear and unchanged. No
change in pulmonary vascular status. Features of right
pneumonectomy are also unchanged
.
[**4-13**] CXR - The ETT and NGT have been removed. Right
pneumonectomy space is unchanged. There continues to be some
patchiness in the left lower lung but not significantly
different. No change in pulmonary vascular status.
.
[**4-14**] CXR - There has been surgery in the right hemithorax with
rib removal. This may have been the pneumonectomy or lobectomy
with collapse of the remaining right lung present since [**2184**].
Aeration at the left lung base since that time has been poor
probably due to chronic scarring and atelectasis perhaps with
some bronchiectasis. The appearance on the films during this
hospitalization has been stable and not appreciably different
compared to [**2184**]. Rightward mediastinal shift is unchanged. The
heart is not significantly enlarged. ET tube is in standard
placement. Tip of the nasogastric tube is at the pylorus. No
pneumothorax.
.
[**4-14**] CXR - The patient is status post right pneumonectomy with
chronic interstitial markings and scarring involving the left
lung base. There is unchanged rightward shift of the trachea and
mediastinal structures. An endotracheal tube is unchanged in a
standard position. Although, assessment of the right internal
jugular venous catheter is slightly limited secondary to
mediastinal shift, the tip likely terminates in the distal SVC.
No pneumothorax is identified. A nasogastric tube is seen with
its tip in the antrum of the stomach.
.
[**4-14**] ECHO - Suboptimal image quality. The left atrium is mildly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function appear normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the report of
the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2184-10-27**],
the overall LVEF has improved.
.
[**4-15**] CXR - The complete opacification of the right hemithorax
with right mediastinal shifting is unchanged representing most
probably previous pneumonectomy. ET tube is in unchanged
standard pos
