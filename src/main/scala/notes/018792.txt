Chief Complaint:
syncope

pacemaker


History of Present Illness:
59 F with CAD s/p LAD BMS x 2 on [**2105-3-16**], CHF (EF 20%), pulm htn
and asthma recently discharged three days ago now presented with
lightheadness and syncope. During her last hospitalization, she
ruled in for an NSTEMI and had cath at NEBH which showed RCA
clot. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for asa desensitization and
cath here showed resolution of the RCA clot. There were 70%
stenosis of the LAD and 2 BMS were placed. She also had SOB from
her asthma and CHF and her diuretic regimen was increased from
lasix to torsemide. Her discharge weight was 137 pounds.
.
At home, she had been feeling weak and lightheaded for the past
3 days. She also had some mild small volume diarrhea. She took
all her medication as prescribed including asa, plavix,
torsemide and her antihypertensives. This morning, she felt
dramatically lightheaded that she had to close her eyes and lay
herself on the kitchen floor. She remembers trying to get up
repeated but eventually lost consciousness. When she woke up,
she discovered a bruise on her face and had pain in her R
shoulder. She was still able to get up and finish her breakfast.
She called her neighbors who came over and encouraged her to
call her doctor. She took her BP and it was in the 70's. The
covering physician encouraged her to come to the ED so she
called an ambulance.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals at triage was listed as 96,
114/90, 88, 100% NC. The blood pressure was thought to be an
error since her BP was in the 60s and 70's when she was
evaluated. She was given about 2L NS. She was started on
dopamine and then neo was added. She got 100 mg IV
hydrocortisone. Her SBP's were in the 90's. EKG had some deeper
STD laterally but cardiac markers were not significantly
elevated. Card's consult saw her in the ED and thought she may
be overdiuresed. She had a central line placed and was admitted
to the CCU.
.
She had chest burning consistent with her heart burn but no new
chest pain. Her right shoulder still has pain. She has SOB but
could not tell if it is her asthma. She reports that her weight
was about 135 pounds at home. She denies palpitations.
.
ROS: Denies orthopnea, PND, peripheral edema. Denies abd pain,
n/v. + dysuria since discharge. Denies hematachezia or BRBPR.

IMAGING
CT HEAD IMPRESSION:
1. Right facial soft tissue hematoma, without evidence of
underlying fracture or intracranial injury.
2. Moderate atrophy of the brain parenchyma is more than
expected for the
patient's age.
3. Hypodensities in the right corona radiata are non-specific,
but could be due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
4. Chronic paranasal sinus mucosal disease, without air-fluid
level.

CT SINUS
IMPRESSION:
1. Right facial soft tissue hematoma, without evidence of
underlying
fracture.
2. Mild chronic paranasal sinus mucosal disease again noted.
3. Moderate brain atrophy redemonstrated.

Shoulder films
IMPRESSION:
1. Probable distal right clavicular fracture, but evaluation is
slightly
limited due to overlying catheter.
2. No fracture or dislocation involving the glenohumeral joint.
3. Displaced right lateral second rib fracture.

CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Acute fracture of the right second lateral rib.
2. Decreased size of small-to-moderate-sized bilateral pleural
effusions,
left greater than right.
3. Cardiomegaly without evidence of congestive heart failure.
4. Possible fracture of the distal right clavicle for which
clinical
correlation is recommended.

[**3-22**] CT TORSO IMPRESSION:
1. Distal right clavicle fracture.
2. No evidence of pneumothorax, solid organ injury or
extraluminal gas.
4. Stable appearance of cardiomegaly.
5. Tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
6. Multiple calcified fibroids.
7. Right renal hypodensity, which is incompletely characterized,
but cystic.
Further imaging with renal ultrasound is recommended.

[**2105-3-24**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the entire septum and inferior wall, hypokinesis of
the anterior wall and anterolateral wall, and hypokinesis of the
distal inferolateral wall. The basal inferolateral wall
contracts best. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging
are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic
dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-3-17**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced. The other
described abnormalities are unchanged.

CXR [**2105-3-24**] IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of left pleural
effusion with complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe. Small
right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Cardiomegaly
without frank volume overload.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
