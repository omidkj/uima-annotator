Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for pericardial effusion drainage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
percutaneous pericardiocentesis s/p pericardial drainage

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 86 yo female w/ h/o CAD, CHF (normal EF), chronic
AF, and HTN who presents as transfer from an OSH for drainage of
pericardial effusion. Patient reports dyspnea on exertion x 1
week. Initially, only occured with ambulation/exertion. She was
scheduled to see a pulmonologist for evaluation, but on the day
before admission, she experienced an episode at rest which was
more severe than before. No CP, diaphoresis, N/V. Also denies LE
edema, orthopnea, or PND. She reports "shaking" uncontrollably
on the evening prior to admission. Subjective fever. Of note,
the patient had been treated for UTI several days prior
(?cipro), which had be switched to nitrofurantoin on the day
prior to admission.
.
Due to worsening SOB and rigors, pt called EMS, went to OSH.
Evaluated and found to be in CHF. Given Lasix with good effect.
Patient admitted, had TTE done showing large pericardial
effusion (1.8cm). Of note, patient known to have chronic
pericardial effusion. Was seen on CTA [**9-22**] as moderate
pericardial effusion. She continued on lasix for diuresis. Was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible drainage of pericardial
effusion on Monday.

CATHETERIZATION [**12-16**]
 1. Initial resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right
atrial
 pressures with intermittant loss of the y-descent. The RVEDP
was
 elevated at 18 mmHg as was the PCWP.
 2. Pericardial pressures were elevated at 10 mmHg but were not
equalized
 with RA pressures. After drainage of ~350 cc of serosanguinous
 pericardial fluid, the pericardial pressure fell to 0 mmHg and
the mean
 RA fell from 16 mmHg to 10 mmHg.
.
ECHO [**12-16**]
Large circumferential pericardial effusion as described above.
(There is a large, circumferential relatively echolucent
pericardial effusion extending 1.5cm anterior to the right
ventricle, around the apex, 2cm lateral to the left ventricle,
and >3cm inferior to the left ventricle. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial or right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen)
Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.
.
ECHO [**12-18**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a moderate-sized,
posterior pericardial effusion. Cannot exclude fluid loculation.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  Compared to
the prior study (images reviewed) dated [**2109-12-16**], the
pericardial effusion is significantly smaller.
.
ECHO [**12-19**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2109-12-18**], no major change is evident.
.
CXR [**12-14**] PA/LAT
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 86 year-old female with CAD, CHF (preserved EF),
chronic AF, and HTN who was transferred from an OSH for
pericardiocentesis after presenting with progressive dyspnea -
ECHO at OSH showed pericardial effusion without evidence of
tamponade. The following issues were addressed during her
hospital stay:
.
1. PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Patient was taken to the
catheterization laboratory where elevated right atrial pressures
were seen and 350cc of serosanguinous fluid were drained (see
full report under "Pertinent Results") - there was no evidence
of tamponade. Patietn was admitted to the CCU for close
monitoring. Subsequent ECHO 1 day later showed improvement in
size of pericardial effusion - loculated posterior collection
was also seen which was not accessible by pericardial catheter.
Drain was kept in place for two days. Patient received repeat
ECHO 1 day after drain removal and no re-accumulation of
pericardial fluid was seen. Patient remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable throughout hospital course. Cytology was
negative for malignanct cells. Fluid chemistry was consistent
with exudative picture. Per PCP/Cardiologist records,
pericardial effusion is a chronic phenomenon, and etiology is
still unknown. PPD, [**Doctor First Name **], TSH, and RF were all unremarkable here.
If pericardial effusion recurs, patient likely to need
pericardial windown (percutaneous vs. operative). Patient to
receive repeat ECHO in 1 week at [**Hospital6 **] and to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**].
.
2. DYSPNEA/CHF
On arrival to the intensive care unit, patient had 1 episode of
mild shortness of breath which responded to 10 IV Lasix. Of
note, patient had not received home Lasix dose that day.
Progressive dyspnea that led to presentation at OSH was likely
due to combination of pericardial effusion and CHF exacerbation
- these issues were addressed with pericardiocentesis and
diuresis, respectively. Patient was subsequently without
breathing difficulty or other respiratory complaints, and O2
Sats were in the mid 90s on room air. Outpatient Lasix 20mg PO
qd was continued with good effect. Following pericardial
drainage, outpatient Digoxin was resumed (0.125 mg PO qd) and BB
continued.
.
3. CHEST PAIN/CAD
Patient experienced 2 isolated episodes of sub-xiphoid chest
pain during hospital course, other VSS. Pain was in location of
pericardial drain, and resolved without issue once drain was
removed. First episode was associated with 0.5mm ST depressions
in V1-V3 ? demand ischemia, though not conclusive. Second
episode without EKG changes, and both responded to 0.5 mg IV
morphine, Per Cardiologist records, patient had MIBI ~1 year ago
which showed no reversible disease. Episodes were attributed to
epicardial irritation secondary to pericardial catheter. If
necessary, issue to be addressed further as outpa
