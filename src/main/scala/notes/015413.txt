Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath

Reason for MICU transfer: Hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71-year-old woman with a past medical history of known
metastatic breast cancer and a known chronic pleural effusion
(has bilateral drains, gets drained QOD). Over past two weeks
she has had increased drainage. She presented to [**Hospital3 **]
hospital with worsening shortness of breath. Sat initially 75%.
She was scheduled for pleuredesis here in the future. Pt states
increasing SOB and increased drain output x 2 weeks, but acutely
worse this week, with the output from the R-sided drain
appearing more bloody. No fevers, chills, diarrhea, vomiting,
abd pain. Does note LE edema bilaterally, as well as productive
cough for the past week. Denies recent sick contacts. She is
undergoing chemo for breast CA (last session Wednesday).

In the ED, initial VS were:  98, 116/54, 97% 15L NRB. CXR
initially with loculated effusions. CT of chest with worsened
pleural effusion. ?distal PE on CTA. Satting 95% on NRB.

On arrival to the MICU, says that her breathing feels better but
still feels SOB. Denies any CP, HA, abdom pain, leg pain.

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes - , Dyslipidemia - ,
Hypertension -
2. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Bilateral stage I lobular carcinoma (see below)
goiter, which is being followed
Basal cell cancer ten years ago
.
PSH:
Tonsillectomy at age 14 and a cholecystectomy at age 25, rotator
cuff surgery at 64 and knee surgery at age 55.
.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
1.  [**5-/2108**]:  Multiple suspicious areas on breast MRI.
Bilateral
breast biopsy demonstrated invasive lobular carcinoma.
2.  [**6-/2108**]:  Underwent bilateral mastectomy for what appeared
to
be multifocal disease in both breasts and had negative sentinel
lymph node biopsy.  The right breast had a lesion staged as T1b
and was grade II, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2 negative,
grade
II.  The left breast lesion was T1C M0, ER/PR positive,
HER-2/neu
negative without lymphovascular invasion and grade II. BRCA [**2-15**]
testing negative.
3.  [**7-/2108**]:  Oncotype DX assay revealed a recurrence score of
21, which was in the intermediate risk group.  The patient
declined enrollment in the TAILORx trial because she did not
want
chemotherapy.  Started on Arimidex.  The last bone mineral
density scan in [**7-/2108**] revealed osteopenia at the left femoral
neck


Social History:
Lives with husband. [**Name (NI) **] 4 kids. Occupation retired school
teacher. Smoking history 20 pack-year smoking hx; quit 33 years
ago. Alcohol denies.


Family History:
A brother who was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 59,
metastatic disease at age 60.  She has a sister who was
diagnosed with breast cancer at age 49 and died at age 51 from
metastatic disease. She has another sister recently diagnosed
with breast cancer in [**2109**]. Genetic testing for BRCA 1 or 2
mutations was performed and was negative.

IMAGING:
-CXR (admission, [**2112-6-26**]): Increased moderate loculated right
and small dependent left pleural effusions with accompanying
mild pulmonary edema.  Infectious process in the right lobe
would be difficult to exclude.

-CXR (most recent, [**2112-7-1**]): Compared to the most recent
radiograph from [**2112-6-30**], moderate right apical pneumothorax
accompanying passive collapse of underlying lung has minimally
increased whereas minimal right basal pneumothorax is smaller.
Bilateral, diffuse, pulmonary edema is constant.  Left
Port-A-catheter tip is in low SVC.  A singel chest tube is
presenting in right lung base.  Left lung base opacity improved
over last 24 hours is mostly atelectasis.

-TTE ([**2112-6-27**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

-CTA chest ([**2112-6-27**]):
1.  Interval increase in large loculated right and small
dependent left
pleural effusions with resultant increase in consolidation in
the right lung, most of which is likely compressive atelectasis.

2.  Bilateral left greater than right ground-glass opacity with
septal
thickening is most likely pulmonary edema, though in this
patient on
chemotherapy accompanying atypical infection would be difficult
to exclude. Progression of metastatic disease is felt less
likely given the time course.
3.  Tiny left apical subsegmental pulmonary embolus of
questionable clinical significance.
4.  Stable mediastinal and hilar metastatic disease

-LENIs ([**2112-6-27**]): No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower
extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77320**] is a 71-year-old woman with h/o metastatic breast
cancer and known chronic pleural effusion (has bilateral Pleurex
catheters, gets drained QOD), who p/w 2 weeks of worsening SOB
and hypoxia. She had persistent hypoxia and a trapped right
lung, for which further intervention could not be undertaken.
During this hospitalization, she made a transition to defer
further aggressive treatment or diagnostics and was transitioned
to comfort measures.  She was initially admitted to the ICU,
however after her decision to focus on comfort was transferred
to the floor on a morphine drip.  She passed away soon after her
transition to the floor in the presence of her husband and
family.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# SOB and Hypoxia: This was likely due to an increase in her
malignant effus
