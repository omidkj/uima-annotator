Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2356**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
74 Yo F with history of COPD presening from home with shortness
of breath.  The patient is on home oxygen (3L "when I need it").
 She reports she couldn't catch her breath even with the oxygen
acutely this morning.  She had URI symptoms for one and a half
weeks.  She presented to her primary pulmonologist who got a CXR
which did not show evidence of pneumonia.  She was started on
advair and tussin, however her symptoms continued to worsen.
This morning she became acutely dyspneic.
.
In the ED initial VS were 99.6 107 191/67 25 92% 15L NRB / SOB.
She was found to be tachypneic, febrile rectally to 101.  CXR
reveals RLL PNA and worsening bl pleural effusions which she has
at baseline in addition to what appears to be volume overload.
Labs were significant for WBC of 17.  EKG was baseline sinus
tach.  She received nebulizer treatments, ceftriaxone, hasnt
gotten azithro because not taking PO, and IV solumedrol.  While
getting nebulizer treatment, her O2 sat dropped to 83%.  She
came up to 85% on NRB, but then improved more when placed on
NIMV.  She received 0.5 ativan during this episode which helped
her symptoms.  Admission Vitals: 101 rectal, 93 143/47 25 99% on
Bipap.
.
On the floor, the patient is uncomfortable with the BiPAP mask,
but feels she is getting enough air.  Otherwise has no
complaints.  She is chronically "chilled" but denies fevers at
home.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo female with history of COPD, RCC s/p resection, chronic
adrenal insufficiency presents with dyspnea admitted to the MICU
for hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
#  Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial from COPD
flare, CAP (RLL infiltrate, cough, fever), and volume overload
from possible new CHF.  Patient was initially on BIPAP on
admission to ICU. She was diuresed with IV lasix, and her
symptoms improved. Patient was treated for COPD flare with
prednisone 60 mg daily and standing nebs.  For her CAP, the
patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin and then
transitioned to levoquin for a total 5 day course. She was
subsequently weaned to face mask and then nasal [**Last Name (un) **] and
transfered to the floor on [**4-3**]. Patient continued to improve
symptomatically and was discharged in stable condition on [**4-5**]
with levofloxacin and PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**].
.
## New onset CHF: Patient presented with volume overload and
responded well to diuresis as detailed above. No echo was
performed because patient reported a recent echo with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
discharge patient was instructed to follow-up with her PCP for
echo results and possible further work-up of CHF. She was also
discharged with lasix to prevent volume overload.

#  Acute on chronic renal failure:  Cr on admission was 2.6
which was elevated from her baseline around 2.  This was most
likely secondary to poor PO intake from recent illness as her Cr
improved with PO hydration. Her lisinopril was held in the
setting of declining renal function. She will follow-up with her
PCP for monitoring.

#  Adrenal insufficiency [**12-23**] bilateral adrenalectomy for RCC:
Patient received high dose prednisone in the setting of illness
but on discharge resumed her home regimen. At no point during
this hospital course did patient have s/s adrenal insufficiency.

#  HTN:  BPs were stable on admission, and her amlodipine,
lisinopril and metoprolol were held initially. She was restarted
on metoprolol in ICU and amlodipine was rest-started on the
floor. Her lisinopril continued to be held secondary to renal
failure (see above).

#) Anemia: Normocytic anemia most likely due to renal failure
and decreased epo. Previous work-up showed nl Fe, nl Ferritin,
nl TIBC. Currently patient is at baseline w/o s/s bleeding.
Patient was instructed to follow-up with her PCP and
nephrologist to see if further interventions (such as epogen)
would be beneficial.

#  HLD:  Stable. On pravastatin.

#  Anxiety:  Stable. Patient was initially put on Ativan PRN in
the MICU and then home xanax was re-started on the floor.

Patient was discharged home in stable condition with symptomatic
improvement. On discharge patient will follow up with her PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: 1) discuss the results echo on [**8-/2111**], 2) evaluate if any
further work-up needed for CHF, 3) monitor electrolytes and
consider restarting lisinopril, and 4) discuss code status.
Lastly patient with follow-up with [**Hospital 2182**] clinic for further
management of her COPD.
