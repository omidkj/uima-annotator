Altered mental status.

1. Intubation

History of Present Illness:
45 y/o M with HIV on HAART, brought to ED by EMS after
reportedly injecting cocaine last night, and subsequently
developing substernal chest pain. He was given nitro spray x2 by
EMS, with no result.
.
On arrival to the ED, triage vital signs included BP 150/80, HR
170, RR 14, and PO2 79% on NRB. He was also reportedly altered.
He was later found to be febrile to 107.8. He was given 0.4 mg
of narcan, with marginal improvement in his mental status. As
the ED team was preparing to intubate the patient for airway
protection, he developed seizure like activity. He was given
lorazepam, and subsequently intubated. He was started on a
midazolam gtt, and was also given propofol. CXR revealed
bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, for which the patient was
given ceftriazone, azithromycin, and vancomycin. Interestingly,
the patient's tox screen was negative for cocaine, but positive
for opiates and amphetamines. Toxicology was consulted, and
recommended treating the patient with benzodiazepines. The
patient underwent aggressive cooling, with subsequent
improvement in his fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. ECG
revealed sinus tachycardia rate-related ST depressions in the
lateral leads. At around 0600, the patient became hypotensive
and he was given aggressive IVF resuscitation with 5L
crystalloid. A CVL was placed, and the patient was started on a
norepinephrine gtt.
.
ABG at 4:30 am on 550x20, PEEP 10, FIO2 100% was 7.22/62/155/27.
He was then switched to 550x26, PEEP 10, FIO2 100%.

his head to denote that he is not having any pain.
