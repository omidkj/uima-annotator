HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59 year old female
with multiple medical problems including coronary artery
disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma,
anxiety, depression, osteoporosis, who was just recently
admitted for subdural hematoma, status post craniotomy and
represented from the [**Hospital3 **], status post
mechanical fall with left hip fracture and urinary tract
infection.  The patient described that she slipped in the
bathroom, no loss of consciousness, had positive head trauma,
no syncope or palpitations prior to fall.  The patient denied
shortness of breath, fever, chills, chest pain, no dysuria,
urgency or frequency and the patient also denied having
incontinence.  In the Emergency Department, the patient
received CT scan which was negative for any acute new
hematoma.  The patient was admitted to the Medical service
for clearance for left hip fracture surgery the next day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was
afebrile, slightly tachycardic, heart rate 101, blood
pressure 118/68, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 100%
in room air.  The patient was cachectic looking, lethargic
appearing, mild to moderate distress.  Her pupils were small
but reactive to light, both equal and round.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  The patient had yellowish covering
over her tongue and mucous membranes appeared to be quite
dry.  The oropharynx was otherwise clear.  The patient also
had a 2.0 centimeter bruise over her forehead.  Chest
examination was clear to auscultation, listened from the
front, because the patient refused to sit up or turn onto her
side due to her hip pain.  The patient's heart was
tachycardic, S1 and S2, positive diastolic murmur on the left
sternal border.  Her belly is soft, nontender, nondistended
with positive bowel sounds.  Her extremities revealed 1+
lower extremity edema.  Her left leg was shortened and
externally rotated with positive pulses on the deep peroneal.
Her skin is warm but dry.  Her neurologic examination
revealed cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  CT of the head showed no acute bleed.  She
had old right frontal subdural hematoma and her x-ray of the
hip showed intertrochanteric fracture on the left femur with
slight impaction.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, no
infiltrate, no congestive heart failure.

Urinalysis was positive for urinary tract infection.  White
blood cell count was 8.9, hematocrit 34.1, platelet count
296,000.  INR was 1.3.  Otherwise, laboratories were
unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hip fracture - The patient was undergoing orthopedic
surgery the following day after admission and the surgery
went well, however, the patient required extended period of
intubation due to her underlying pulmonary disease.  The
patient required being in the Intensive Care Unit for three
days and then was successfully extubated and her hip fracture
scar was well healed.  There is no active issue on discharge.

2.  Urinary tract infection - The patient was found to have
positive Klebsiella pneumoniae in her urine culture [**2178-11-6**],
and was started on Levofloxacin for a ten day course.  On

to have yeast infection and the patient was given one dose of
Fluconazole.

3.  Diarrhea - The patient continued to have diarrheal
episodes and the patient was previously in her last hospital
admission found to have Clostridium difficile positive stool
and was started on Flagyl and has finished Flagyl around mid
[**Month (only) **] and the patient's diarrhea restarted recently and
did not get better.  We sent another stool to check for
Clostridium difficile and it was still positive and with the
patient's elevation of white blood cell count, we decided to
start Vancomycin on [**2178-11-16**], and the patient will be
discharged to rehabilitation with continuing Vancomycin.

4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma - The
patient's respiratory status was back to her baseline with
good oxygen saturation in room air.  Continued her outpatient
