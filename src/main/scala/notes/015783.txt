HTN, DM2 with neuropathy and retinopathy, weight loss,
depression, fatigue, long-time smoking history etc. She is on
Aspirin and Plavix. She lives with her daughter, and at around

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, not terribly cooperative with

3 mm bilaterally. [**Month (only) 116**] have a right visual field defect,
difficult to assess properly. Left exotropia. Extraocular
movements intact bilaterally without nystagmus. Unreliable

water without any difficulty. Shoulder shrug is symmetric.
Tongue midline.

Motor: Extensive muscle wasting, and cachectic. No observed

the commands to assess for pronator drift. Moves the right side
anti-gravity, but appears to neglect it. Does move the left side
independently and against gravity.

Coordination and Sensation: Could not be assessed due to her
inability to understand. She has a baseline of stocking
neuropathy secondary to her diabetes.

MICRO:
Urine Cx ([**12-22**]): pending

IMAGING:
ECG ([**12-17**]): Technically difficult study, Sinus rhythm at a rate
of 72, Anteroseptal infarct - age undetermined, ST-T wave
abnormalities

CT Head, CTA Head/Neck (prelim) ([**12-17**]): CT Head: 22x15 mm left
thalamic acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage, without shift of
normally midline structures. Age related involution changes.
Periventricular white matter small vessel ischemic changes.

CTA Head/Neck: FINAL REPORT PENDING 3-D RECONSTRUCTIONS.
Vascular
calcifications along aortic arch, carotid bulbs and intracranial
carotid
arteries bilaterally. No evidence of high grade stenosis,
obstruction of flow or aneurysm seen. Patent right PComm, with
small right P1, normal variant. D/W Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in ED upon
completion of study re: ICH. Centrilobular emphysema with
several left lung nodules, largest measuring 5-mm. Debris in
upper intrathoracic esophagus.

CXR ([**12-17**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Emphysema. Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension.

CT Head ([**12-18**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Slight increase in size of acute left thalamic parenchymal
hemorrhage,
with edema, as well as the amount of intraventricular
hemorrhage.
2. Though the apparent slightly increased prominence of the
ventricular system may relate to differences in slice selection
and angulation, in this setting, finding raises concern for
early hydrocephalus; attention should be paid to this on
subsequent studies.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 74 year old woman with a history of CAD,
hypertension, and type II diabetes mellitus who presented with
acute onset right sided weakness and dysarthria, and was found
to have a 22x15 mm left thalamic acute intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. She takes Aspirin and Plavix at home, and these were
discontinued on admission. The cause of her hemorrhage was
thought to be most likely hypertensive hemorrhage. She was
initially admitted to the NeuroICU, but was transferred to the
Neurology floor when stable. CEs: CK 38-28-[**Medical Record Number 40365**], TropT
<0.01 x4. She was continued on her home doses of Amlodipine 10
daily, Lisinopril 40 qhs, Lasix 20 PO daily, and Metoprolol 125
mg [**Hospital1 **]. Her Aspirin 325 mg daily can be restarted in 1 week. Her
Plavix will be held indefinitely. The Plavix was started in [**5-17**]
for medical management of presumed CAD, and it is not clear if
she needs to continue this medication. This was discussed with
her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at th
