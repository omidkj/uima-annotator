PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
======================
Burkitt's lymphoma on [**2110-8-13**] after having a lymph node
biopsy of the right axilla. He presented with 2 weeks of a
rapidly growing mass in the right axilla that he says grew to
the size of a plum. Was also having constitutional symptoms at
presentation.
FISH was performed and it was positive for a rearrangement
involving MYC. He had a bone marrow biopsy performed on
[**2110-8-28**] and this revealed a hypercellular bone marrow with
trilineage hematopoiesis, no histomorphologic evidence of
leukemia, or lymphoproliferative disorder was seen.
Tx: 2 cycles of chemotherapy using the Vanderbilt protocol. This
involved Cytoxan on day 1 and 2 and then etoposide on days 1, 2,
and 3; followed by vincristine on day 8 and day 22; bleomycin on
day 8 and day 22; methotrexate on day 15; and leucovorin on day
15; and prednisone on days 1 through 7.
On cycle 2, he had Cytoxan on day 1 only; etoposide on days 1,
2,
and 3; doxorubicin on days 1 and 2; vincristine on days 8 and
22;
bleomycin on days 29, 8, and 22; methotrexate and leucovorin on

day 15; and prednisone on days 1 through 7. He does report that

IMAGING
CXR [**6-24**] IMPRESSION: Findings are most likely due to infection
including PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 18617**], bacterial or atypical pneumonia. Lymphoma
is less likely, but not totally excluded.

Ct Torso IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities and scattered areas
of focal
consolidation has a wide differential which includes infectious
(aspiration, PCP or [**Name10 (NameIs) 18617**]), inflammatory (drug reaction from
bleomycin) or neoplastic (multifocal BAC) etiologies. Followup
after therapy can be obtained to ensure resolution of these
lesions.
2. Hilar and mediastinal adenopathy may be reactive or may
reflect Burkitt's lymphoma recurrence and should be followed to
resolution.
3. Fusion of the left transverse process of L5 to S1 increases
risk for
degenerative disc disease at L4-L5.
4. Mild hepatosplenomagealy.
5. Severe apical bullous emphysema.
