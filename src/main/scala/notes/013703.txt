Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4975**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with BMS to mid LAD


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M w/PMHx sx for HTN, hyperlipidemia and
IDDM who presented [**2105-5-31**] with a bilateral chest sensation
which she describes as "terrible burning", with radiation to the
back, starting at 10 am and lasting until she arrived in the ED
at 11:30 am. Patient had associated nausea and vomiting as well.
Her daughter called EMS, and prior to arrival in the ED, patient
received nitro SL x 3 and ASA 325.

<br>In the ED, patient's initial VS were: 96.1 HR 50 BP 135/75
RR 12 O2sat 100%, and she was found to have STE in V3-V5 on EKG,
and was taken emergently to cardiac catheterization, where she
was found to have a focal 90% mid LAD lesion with TIMI II flow,
and a BMS was placed. She received integrillin bolus,
atorvastatin 80 mg, Plavix 600 mg, and heparin gtt.

<br>Reviewing her recent history with her daughters (one of whom
lives with her, and the other of whom lives downstairs), Ms
[**Known lastname 60285**] has been dependent on them for most ADLs including
cooking, showering and most other household chores, as well as
administering her three-times-daily insulin. She can do basic
self-care including bathing. She has been significantly hampered
by her neuropathy which makes walking and using stairs
difficult. In terms of recent symptoms, they have only noticed
that she appears to have been progressively more fatigued over
the last 1-2 months with a more marked fatigue over the last 2
weeks. They also think she may have had some left sholder pain
over the last week or two.

<br>She had been prescribed nitroglycerin in the past but her
daughters report that she was using it whenever she felt poorly
and as a result was often getting light-headed, "practically
passing out" so she is not using this now.

<Br>On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She has a possible--but ambiguous--history of
TIAs. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors; or exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

<br>Cardiac review of systems is notable for prior chest pain.
She denies dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

<br><b>CCU course:</b> patient went to the CCU for observation
after the intervention as the floor did not have available beds.
While in the CCU she did have new onset afib for which she was
placed on hep gtt and then spontaneously converted. She also had
left sided systolic heart failure with and echo showing EF of
30% and a requiring 4L NC. She was diuresed with 10mg IV lasix
and responded well, putting out 1.7L and weaning to 2L NC. On
arrival to floor she denied any SOB or chest pain. She reported
feeling tired.

CXR ([**2105-5-31**]):
Heart size is enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. The hilar
contours are normal. No pneumothorax is visualized. Diffuse
prominence of the interstitial marking which is more prominent
in the perihilar region and upper lobes are consistent with a
mild pulmonary edema. No focal consolidative process is noted.
Small left pleural thickening/effusion is unchanged. The
compression deformity of mid thoracic vertebra is relatively
unchanged compared to the prior study.

IMPRESSION
1. No pneumothorax or focal consolidative process is visualized.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.
2. Unchanged small left pleural thickening/effusion.
3. Compression deformity of the mid thoracic vertebra.

ECHO [**2105-5-31**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is moderate to severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anterior,
septal hypokinesis and apical akiensis (LVEF= 30 %). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The aortic valve is not well
seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2103-9-19**], LV
systolic dysfunction is new.

Cardiac Catherization [**2105-5-31**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant vessel

revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary
artery
disease.  The LAD had a 90% mid-LAD lesion with TIMI 2 flow. The
LCx had
a 40% mid-vessel lesion of a major OM.  The RCA had a 70%
stenosis in
the mid-PDA, with otherwise minimal disease.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial
systolic
hypertension.
3. Successful PTCA/stenting to mid LAD with a 2.5x15mm Vision
stent and
posted with a 2.75mm NC balloon. Excellent result with normal
flow down
vessel and no residual stenosis.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction.
4. Successful PCI/stent to mid LAD with bare metal stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 60285**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/PMHx sx for HTN, IDDM,
