X 2, 60 mg IV X 1, while awaiting labetalol gtt), with minimal
improvement in BPs to 218/150s. She received two doses 10 mg IV
hydralazine as well. HR up to 100s over course of ED stay. She
received a total of 3 mg dilaudid in the ED for headache as well
as zofran 4 mg X 2 and compazine 10 mg IV X 1 for nausea. She
took her home meds of clonidine 0.1 mg, metoprolol 150 mg po,
losartan 100 mg PO, and hydralazine 50 mg PO. She also received
benadryl 25 mg PO X 2 for pruritis.

better blood pressures. No preceding fever, difficulty
breathing, chest pain, abdominal pain per the patient and her
mother.

Past Medical History:
* MPGN: Diagnosed age 9 by biopsy. S/p LRRT in 08/[**2175**]. Post
transplant pt was doing well, but had rising Cr for two year. In

[**6-/2178**] pt presented with uncontrolled BP requiring ICU
admission for Isradipine drip. Repeat biopsy showed a type 1
MPGN. Negative Hep C, Hep B, [**Doctor First Name **], and renal U/S from NMEC showed
stable AVF. Her creatinine peaked to 4's and she was started on
steroids, prograf and cellcept. In [**1-/2179**], she required 3
sessions of HD through a right upper chest catheter. Creatinine
slowly recovered to 3.2. Plasmapheresis was then initiated with
plan to then treat with Rituximab. She only underwent 3 sessions
of [**Year (4 digits) **]. Outpatient neprhologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **] & Dr.

********************Studies*******************
[**2179-8-16**]  CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**7-7**],
there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette, accentuated by the low lung volumes. Mild
indistinctness of pulmonary vessels may reflect some
overhydration. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia. No evidence
of dialysis catheter.

[**2179-8-16**]  CT Head - FINDINGS: There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, or mass. The sulci and ventricles are normal
in caliber and configuration. The visualized mastoid and ethmoid
air cells and paranasal sinuses are clear. There is no fracture
or soft tissue abnormality noted. IMPRESSION: No acute
intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] is a 21 yo F with history of ESRD on PD s/p failed renal
tx after recurrence of MPGN, with recurrent admissions for
hypertensive urgency, who again presented during this admission
with hypertensive urgency.

In the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known firstname 76880**] BP could not be well controlled with
periodic doses of Labetalol and Hydralazine.  She also had
difficulty taking her home anti-HTN meds due to nausea and
vomiting.  She was transferred to the MICU where her BP required
up to 8mg/hr on labetalol drip, intermittent Norvasc, and a
Clonidine patch to achieve adequate control.  She was restarted
on all her home po BP meds overnight, and on [**8-16**] the labetalol
gtt was stopped.  She was stable and tolerating her home meds by
the time of transfer to the floor later that afternoon with BPs
in the 150s/90s.

In regards to her ESRD, [**Known firstname **] received PD while in the MICU.
The first night PD was performed per patient's home manual dwell
(per mother & prior PD orders in POE, 2.5% diasylate, used 4
hour dwells per recent admission instructions).  Once known, she
was transitioned to her outpatient PD settings of 2.5%, 4.25%,
2.5%, 4.25%, 2.5% alt doses with 1 hr each.  Nephrology follwed
her during this hospitalization and added aluminum hydroxide to
usual regimen of renagel for increased her phos.

[**Known firstname 76880**] HA and nausea were treated with Percocet and Zofran
respectively and on the morning of discharge she was much
improved with near resolution of her symptoms once her BP was
well-controlled.

The plan at time of discharge was for [**Known firstname **] to follow-up with
her primary care nephrologist as well as Neurology for her HAs.

She remained full code throughout this hospitalization.
