Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Multidrug overdose

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line insertion
PICC line insertion

History of Present Illness:
46M h/o depression, narcotics abuse, multiple hospitalizations
for drug overdoses [**2-27**] suicide attempts (last in [**1-2**]), and
hepatitis C, presented to [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital late night [**2151-2-1**]
- early morning [**2151-2-2**] after having been found down by his wife
on [**2151-2-1**] at 2100 with a empty bottle of ibuprofen next to him.
 Initial ABG at AJH was pH 7.06/43/249/13.  Earlier, pt had
declared to wife that he was "going to kill himself" if his wife
divorced him; wife ultimately reiterated her intention to leave
him.
.
At the time of presentation to OSH, pt received naloxone, was
intubated and started on bicarb gtt.  Notable laboratories at
OSH included acetaminophen level at 672, AST 322, ALT 240, INR
1.4.  Pt was then given N-acetylcysteine 9000 mg at 0130am on
[**2151-2-2**] and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], repeat ABG pH 7.33/pCO2 29/pO2 575/HCO3 16.  Pt was
hemodynamically stable in ED except for brief rise of BP to
200/100, for which he was transiently on labetalol drip.
Arterial line was placed.  Repeat labs showed acetaminophen 390,
AST 525, ALT 314, INR 2.9.  Pt did not receive N-acetylcysteine
in the ED but was given an additional load of 8400 mg nAc and
activated charcoal upon transfer to the MICU.
.
ROS:  Unable to assess given intubated, sedated.

Imaging:
.
[**2151-2-2**] CT head from OSH: No acute intracranial pathology.
.
[**2151-2-2**] CXR:  Endotracheal tube is well positioned. A nasogastric
tube is detected coursing through the mediastinum with tip out
of view and side port in the expected region of the gastric
fundus.  The lungs are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
is normal.  No effusion or pneumothorax.
.
[**2151-2-2**] CT C-spine
1.  No acute fracture or abnormal alignment.
2.  Multilevel degenerative changes.
.
[**2151-2-4**] CT head w/o contrast:  Normal study.
.
[**2151-2-5**] CT head w/o contrast:  Slight effacement of sulci since
the study of [**2151-2-4**]. This may indicate global swelling.

Brief Hospital Course:
46M h/o polysubstance abuse, hepatitis C, depression, and
multiple past suicide attempts, presented from OSH with suicide
attempt via polysubstance ingestion, most notably acetaminophen
with APAP level in the ?600s (390 here), intubated for airway
protection, admitted to the ICU s/p ingestion and intubation.
Admission was complicated by fulminant hepatic failure and
resulting cerebral edema, CNS-related fevers, coagulopathy, and
respiratory failure.
.
# Cerebral edema [**2-27**] fulminant hepatic failure: Pt presented
with altered mental status [**2-27**] multidrug ingestion, but serial
neurological tests as well as increasing ammonia levels
indicated the likely development of hepatic encephalopathy,
raising the concern for cerebral edema.  Repeat CT head
demonstrated progressive sulci effacement concerning for global
swelling.  [**2-5**] EEG was non-eleptiform but demonstrated low
voltage.  One dose of mannitol was initially used to attempt to
reduce cerebral edema, but given pt's elevated serum osmoles,
this was not repeated.  Deeper sedation with midazolam was
attempted to control respiratory status and reduce seizure risk,
but pt was nevertheless noted to seize on [**2-7**], with R arm
twitching and R head deviation, not controlled with high-dose
propofol drip.  After discussions among neurology, pharmacy,
hepatology, and MICU team, pt was placed on pentobarbitol gtt to
control intracranial pressure, with continuous EEG monitoring to
assess seizure activity.  Cooling blankets were also used to
further reduce core temperature to goal of 35-36 in an attempt
to control cerebral edema.  Pentobarbitol gtt was discontinued
on [**2151-2-9**] in order to better assess pt's neurological status.
After pt was made [**Date Range 3225**], no further neurological monitoring was
undertaken.
.
# Fulminant hepatic failure [**2-27**] acetaminophen overdose:  Pt was
loaded with NAC at 1am on [**2151-2-2**] at OSH but did not receive NAC
x 7-8 hrs after first dose.  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was
reloaded with NAC and then transitioned to NAC infusion per
hepatology recommendations until LFTs <1000 or INR < 2.  Pt was
not considered a transplant candidate given his polysubstance
abuse and psychiatric history.  NAC infusion was discontinued
after AST and ALT fell below 1000.  Although liver function
tests began to normalize, cerebral edema [**2-27**] fulminant hepatic
failure complicated the [**Hospital **] hospital course, leading to the
decision to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated for airway protection at
OSH ED given his multidrug overdose.  Pt initially tolerated
pressure support, but was later noted to be persistently
overbreathing the ventilator, raising the concern for
intr
