Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1580**]
Chief Complaint:
bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
62 yo male with Hep C cirrhosis and HCC who presented to OSH
today after noting several weeks of worsening abd girth and
associated diffuse pain, as well as new lower extr edema. The pt
also experienced two episodes of BRBPR on the day of admission,
which is what prompted him acutely to seek medication attention.
Pt's HCT at the OSH was found to be 29 (unclear baseline) and he
was noted to be hypotensive with an SBP first in the 80s-90s
(close to baseline per pt) and then lower to the 70s. The pt was
started on a dopamine gtt to support his BP and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were HR 98, R 16, 92/58, 96% RA.
The pt had an NG levage which was negative and a transfusion of
2 units pRBCs was initiated.

On ROS, the endorses occasional chills but no fevers. No chest
pain or SOB. Abd pain as above but no nausea or vomiting. No
urinary sxs. Blood per rectum as described above but otherwise
no change in stool. No neuro or MSK sxs.

Past Medical History:
Hep C complicated by HCC
CAD s/p LAD stenting and ICD impant
COPD, 35 pack year smoking hx
psoriasis

Former construction worker, now diabled. Prior smoker. Denies
EtOH.


Family History:

distress.
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI. MMM. Conjunctival icterus.
Neck: Supple, without adenopathy or JVD. No tenderness with
palpation.
Chest: CTAB anterior and posterior.

.
CT Abd/Pelvis
1. Very limited examination due to no IV contrast and a minimal
amount of
oral contrast within loops of bowel. No CT findings to suggest
obstruction. Gas-filled loops of large bowel, predominantly the
transverse may suggest ileus.
2. Diffusely heterogeneous and enlarged liver consistent with
patient's known cirrhosis and multifocal HCC. Mild-to-moderate
amount of ascites within the abdominal cavity.
3. Atherosclerotic disease within the coronary circulation and
aorta.
4. Known left renal cyst.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Mild ascites.
.
Abd Ultrasound
1. Multiple confluent nodules in the right lobe of the liver.
Multiple
confluent solid masses identified in the left lobe of the liver.
The liver is markedly enlarged but no biliary dilatation.
2. Patent hepatic vasculature.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted to the medical ICU for closer care and
monitoring. Although initial attempts were made to wean him from
the dopamine he had arrived with, his pressor requirements
actually increased, his renal failure worsened and his overall
clinical status deteriorated. Radiologic evaluation of the
abdomen demonstrated a markedly enlarged liver but no ascites
that could be tapped. With clinical deterioration, the pt's
mental status also declined. He and his family members made
clear that he would not want aggressive measures to prolong his
life in the face of a poor overall prognosis, and thus the pt's
goals of care were transitioned to comfort. Pressors were
stopped and morphine was used to relieve the pt's abdominal
pain. Approximately one day after making this transition, the
patient expired with his family at his side. The pt's PCP and
oncologist were notified of his passing. An autopsy was
declined.
