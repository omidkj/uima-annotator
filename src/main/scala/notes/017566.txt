HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is one of several [**Hospital3 **] Hospital admissions for this elderly male.

The history of this admission goes back to a previous
admission in [**2188-9-14**] when the patient was admitted
for repair of an incarcerated paraileostomal hernia in the
setting of a prior hernia repair.  This operation itself
followed a panproctocolectomy for Crohn's disease.

Following that operation, the patient appeared to be doing
well and was, however, readmitted to the hospital on [**2188-10-13**]
until [**2188-10-21**] with what appeared to be left upper quadrant
pain and a hematoma but there was nothing that appeared to
warrant surgery.  He was consequently discharged home on
[**2188-10-21**] but then readmitted on [**2188-10-27**] which is the date of
this admission.

The reason for this readmission was that the patient
continued to have developed temperatures and a high white
cell count while an outpatient and developed increasing left
upper quadrant pain.  On this occasion, he was readmitted and
CAT scanned and a fluid collection which was not evident on
the previous admission was drained.  He was then admitted to
the floor for further follow-up.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post panproctocolectomy for
Crohn's disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The physical examination
revealed an elderly male.  HEENT:  Normal.  Heart and lungs:
Clear.  Abdomen:  Well-healed midline incision, an ostomy on
the left lower quadrant and a drain site in the right upper
quadrant.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's condition appears to have
evolved following his admission in that he developed a
clear-cut enterocutaneous fistula which began to necessitate
via the midline incision.  Much thought was given to how to
deal with this including consultations with other surgeons.
He was, therefore, placed on intravenous elementation in the
hopes that this fistula would either be controlled on its own
or that his metabolic state would allow us to reenter his
abdomen and try to address the situation.

On [**2188-12-6**], he was taken back to the Operating Room in hopes
of being able to create an ileostomy proximal to the fistula.
However, this operation proved to be impossible owing to
dense adhesions within the abdomen.  Nothing further was done
and he was, therefore, returned to the floor for further
intravenous elementation, antibiotics, and all supportive
care.  Despite this, however, the patient continued to
dwindle and he finally died on [**2189-1-11**].

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Enterocutaneous fistula.

OPERATION PERFORMED:  Exploratory laparotomy.

DISPOSITION:  The patient died.
