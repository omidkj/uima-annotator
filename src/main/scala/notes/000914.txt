Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, fever to 108 and hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation.

History of Present Illness:
55F s/p lap appy (perforated retrocecal appendix) converted to
open [**3-31**] who had fever to 102 after procedure yesterday and was
tachycardic, received 1 dose unasyn and then was febrile to 108
this am with altered mental status.   Pt was intubated for signs
of respiratory distress and was placed on a cooling blanket and
received cold gastric lavage.  Unasyn was d/c'd and Zosyn and
Vanc were started and central line placed.  CT head, chest, abd
neg for acute processes.  Pt was paralyzed and sedated for
presumed seratonin syndrome.  Cryptoheptadine was administered.
Prozac was d/c'd (last dose [**2110-4-1**] 1am). At 8:30pm [**4-1**] pt
became hypotensive to SBP <80 mmHg and Levophed started prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. During transfer Neosinephrine was addeded for
additional support.

Physical Exam:
VS: T 101.6 BP 123/78 HR 83 AC 500 X 14 P 10 FiO2 50%
Gen: NAD, intubated, not responsive, flaccid
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL (3 mm)
Neck: no LAD
Chest: CTAB
CV: RRR nl s1 s2 no mrg appreciated
Abd: soft, NT, mildly distended + BS, 5 cm horizontal incision
near umbilicus, CDI with staples. 15 cm horizontal incision R
abdomen CDI with staples.
Ext: obese, non-pitting edema
Neuro: flaccid, likely still paralyzed from cisatracurium given
at OSH. PERRL. tracking with eyes.
Skin: no rash

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**4-2**]: Mild cardiomegaly accompanied by moderate distention
of the mediastinal vasculature. Mild pulmonary edema and small
right pleural effusion suggest cardiac decompensation and/or
volume overload. There is no pneumothorax. Tip of the
endotracheal tube ends above the clavicles, at least 5.5 cm
above the carina, probably 2-3 cm above optimal placement.
Nasogastric tube passes to the distal stomach and out of view.
Tip of the right jugular central line projects over the course
of the right brachiocephalic vein. No pneumothorax.
.
TTE [**4-2**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is not well seen (probably mildly thickened
leaflets). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**4-5**]: 1. Complex cystic focus in the left adnexa
with apparent enlargement of the left ovary. This is worrisome
for an ovarian malignancy. Tuboovarian abscess is considered
less likely as there is no inflammatory reaction surrounding the
ovary. Further evaluation could be obtained with ultrasound. 2.
No fluid collection is identified in the retrocecal space. 3.
Sigmoid diverticulosis. 4. No acute hepatobiliary or pancreatic
abnormalities identified. 5. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 55yoF s/p appendectomy for ruptured retrocecal appy, still
febrile on Abx.
.
1. Sepsis:
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with sepsis syndrome from
OSH, was hypotensive and with high fevers. Soon after transfer
she was hemodynamically stable. She was continued on broad
spectrum antibiotics. There was no pathogen identified, although
she was treated for a presumed PNA as well as a possible GI
source given the history of appendectomy at the OSH. There was
an initial concern for a Gyn source of infection, possible L
[**Last Name (un) **], Gynecology was consulted, and this was found to be less
likely. The infection resolved with empiric antibiotics
.
2. Altered MS/seizures:
After the sepsis was resolving, the pt was noted to have
persistent coma. She remained unarousable, with flaccid limbs
not withdrawing to pain. Neurology was consulted. She was noted
at one point to have jerking movements suggestive of seizure
activity, initial ECG was negative for epileptogenic activity.
In order to rule out meningitis, LP was attempted by radiology
under fluoro although was unsuccessful. She was treated for
possible HSV and bacterial meningitis empirically. There was
high clinical suspicion for status epilepticus, continuous EEG
monitoring was done and confirmed seizure activity. The patient
was started on depakote for seizure prophylaxis. The etiology of
the initial CNS insult was assessed as likely sustained when
hypotensive and febrile to 108. Over the course of the
hospitalization, the patient's mental status showed minimal
improvement. She was able to interact and follow commands
limited to movements of her eyes and tongue. She demonstrated
extremely limited ability to perform movements below the neck.
She remained quadraplegic She had no gag reflex and could not
breathe off of the ventilator.
.
3. Withdrawal of Life Support:
Extensive discussions were held with the patient as well as
members of her immediate family with the attending physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well as other members of the medical team. It was
explained to the patient and family that in her current state,
she could not live without life support from the venitalor since
she was not able to breathe on her own. They were explained the
option to have a tracheotomy for ventilation at rehab where she
would have an opportunity for a longer-term recovery, although
there was no guarantee that she would be able to come off of the
ventilator. Whether the patient would make any meaningful
neurological recovery was also uncertain.  The patient and
family expressed a clear decision that the patient did not want
to remain on the ventilator and that she wanted to be off of
life support. She indicated that she understood the
implications. The patient was extubated and passed away shortly
therafter with family and friends present.
.
4. Respiratory failure:
The patient remained ventilator dependent during the hospital
stay as noted above,
.
5. Pancreatitis:
There was an isolated elevation of pancreatic enzymes in the
abscence of symptoms. She received a post-pyloric tube for
feeding. After several days, this was trending down and tube
feeds were done through an NG tube.
.
6. Anemia:
Hct remained 25 range stable.
.
7. Trop leak:
trop peak to 0.55 on [**4-3**], elevated CK [**1-16**] rhabdo. Likely demand
ischemia in setting of septic shock.
.
8. Rhabdomyolisis:
CK peaked [**Numeric Identifier 43631**] on [**4-6**], and later resolved. Her renal funtion
remained intact.

# Thrombocytosis:
most likely reactive [**1-16**] infection, trending down.
.
# s/p appy on [**4-1**]: appreciate surgery recs, no active issues.
.
# FEN: continue TFs, new OG tube placed [**4-17**]. electrolyte
repletion as needed.
.
# Ppx: PPI, pneumoboots, heparin SC, bowel regimen.
# Code: Full initially, but then later in the hospitialization
converted to DNR/DNI.
# Access: 20g PIV x 2, RtF A-line [**4-11**]
