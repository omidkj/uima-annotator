Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Dypsnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dobhoff tube placement.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y.o. F with daistolic and systolic CHF (EF
35% on [**10/2183**]), hypertension, paroxysmal afib on coumadin, who
presents with shortness of breath.
.
From [**Date range (1) 101008**]/09, the patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for
shortness of breath x 24 hours with orthopnea, likely acute on
chronic systolic CHF.  She also had R sided chest pain and
slightly increased confusion.  Denied at that time any change in
her chronic cough.  In the ED, T 96, HR 100, BP 130/90, RR 20
and O2 100% on RA.  BNP was 4478 at that time. CXR c/w
interstitial edema.  During this hospitalization, she was
continued on her outpatient medications and given IV lasix x 2.
She was able to be weaned off oxygen.  Home lasix was restarted
at 30 mg po at discharge.  She was also treated for UTI with IV
ceftriaxone x 5 days.  She also was noted to be hypernatremic,
which resolved with D5W.  She was discharged with f/u to assess
uptitration of her lasix as an outpatient.
.
The patient's son noted that the patient had a persistent,
intermittently productive cough of clear sputum since 6 PM the
night prior to admission. She usually has a cough, but this one
was more "lung" like in nature.  He denied fever, chills,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea at home.  He called the VNA nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 101009**]s the patient, who reportedly found her dyspneic and
hypoxic and referred pt to ED for evaluation. [**Name (NI) 1094**] son states
she had a BM yesterday.  States that the pt's case manager came
yesterday afternoon and was getting over a cold, but that she
was not coughing. He notes that his mom, otherwise, has been
doing very well at home.  Baseline mental status is that she can
understand but can forget things. Of note, pt takes Tylenol
standing [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED, initial VS: T 98.9  HR 90  BP 113/84  RR 22  100% on
NRB.
Labs, including blood cultures, were drawn. Portable CXR, EKG,
CTA, CT abdomen/pelvis completed. Given Aspirin 325 mg po x 1,
Vancomycin 1 gm IV x 2, and Zosyn 4.5 mg IV x 1. Pt started on
bipap in ED. ABG 7.46/38/109/28.  Cards consulted in ED; did not
think it was CHF but pneumonia.
.
Currently, the patient is coughing.  She says her name is [**Name (NI) **].
.
ROS: Per son.
(+) shortness of breath, cough, constipation
(-) fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea.

IMPRESSION:
1. No central or segmental pulmonary embolus. No acute aortic
abnormality.
2. Marked four-chamber cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary
edema. Large
pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary artery
hypertension.
3. Marked fecal impaction, with the maximal rectal diameter
measuring 10 cm, likely resulting in significant distal
constipation. Disimpaction may be of benefit.
4. Large right femoral hernia containing loops of small bowel,
some of which are slightly enlarged, although without clear
high-grade obstruction.  However, a component of partial or
intermittent obstruction cannot be excluded. Recommend low
threshold for reimaging with oral contrast.
5. Colonic diverticulosis, with somewhat hazy appearance at the
splenic
flexure, likely related to artifact. No definite evidence of
acute
diverticulitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 86 yo F w/ PMHx of CHF (EF 35% on
[**10/2183**]), HTN, paroxysmal afib on coumadin, who presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2185-9-1**] with respiratory distress concerning
for pneumonia. She was admitted to the MICU service and on HD#2
transferred to the medicine service.  She received a thorough
evaluation and treatment for her respiratory symptoms and on
[**2185-9-10**] her condition had improved and she was
discharged to home, with stable vital signs, not requiring
oxygen. Her hospital course was notable for:
.
# Respiratory distress: Pt presented w/ respiratory distress
transiently requiring BiPAP in the ED. At the time of admission,
the Pt had a leukcytosis and LLL infiltrate seen on chest CT
concerning for pneumonia. Given her recent hospitalization for
CHF exacerbation, treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics were
started for HCAP. She was ruled out for myocardial infarction
with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes and was monitored on
telemetry. The Pt required supplemental oxygen for much of her
hospitalization from 1-4 L, but at the time of discharge had
been off supplemental oxygen for >48 hours and was able to
maintain O2 sats > 92%. Throughout her course, blood and sputum
cultures showed no growth. It was thought that the Pt's
respiratory distress was likely due to pneumonia, most likely
aspiration PNA given her end stage dementia and witnessed
aspirations. On HD # 5, a CXR showed collapse of the RLL. The Pt
was managed with regular suctioning and nebulizers. It was
thought that the collapse was likely due to mucous plugging or
aspiration as the patient had difficulty clearing secretions;
the collapse resolved on subsequent imaging. She completed a 7
day course of v
