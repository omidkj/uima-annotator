History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname 31624**] is a 61-year-old M, now 12 years after trimodality
therapy for esophageal cancer. He was recently diagnosed with a
fistula from the carina of the trachea to the gastric conduit,
presumably based on the foreign body of the lesser curvature
staple line eroding into the airway. Biopsies of both the
bronchial and gastric side of this had not shown any malignancy,
nor was there any mass lesion visible by CT scan. His Y-stent is
effectively controlling and
preventing ongoing biliary soilage of the lower lobe at this
time. He remains nutritionally behind, and given the irradiated
field, a feeding jejunostomy was placed on [**2103-7-2**] for his
nutritional gains and to divert the pancreatic and biliary
drainage, which tends to reflux into the gastric conduit, to
allow unrestricted healing of this site.

Patient returns on this admission for further surgical repair of
his tracheoesophageal fistula repair.

Upper GI SBFT [**2103-10-19**]:
Status post esophagectomy, with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy
anastomosis. No evidence of leak or obstruction at the GJ
anastomosis, although contrast is slow flowing through the
anastomosis, consistent with postoperative edema. Although
incompletely assessed, contrast has likely traversed through the
JJ anastomosis.

CTA [**2103-10-21**]
1. Interval development of bilateral segmental and subsegmental
pulmonary
emboli.
2. Decreasing size of posterior mediastinal collection in
comparison to prior study.
3. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions. Continued airspace
disease at
right lung base. Development of ground-glass attenuation in
bilateral lung
fields, which can be consistent with worsening infection or
infarcts.

LE US
No evidence of acute DVT involving the right or left lower
extremities.

UP US
Partially occlusive thrombus of the right axillary vein. These
findings were discussed in person with the medical resident
caring for the
patient.

CXR
Large round opacity in left lower lung, in part due to loculated

intrafissural fluid, but also raising the possibility for either
a rounded
pneumonia or evolving lung abscess


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for Roux-n-Y
gastrojejunostomy (esophageal conduit) with intra-thoracic
anastamosis, small bowel resection, and J-tube for repair of his
tracheoesophageal fistula on [**2103-10-8**]. Epidural placed and split
with PCA to provide additional pain control. He was transferred
to the thoracic surgical floors for further postoperative
recovery.

[**Date range (3) 78800**]: Patient followed a normal postoperative course.
He ambulated without any difficulty with assistance. He was kept
NPO with tube feeds at goal via J-tube. Patient transfused 2
units pRBC for Hct of 20. Post-transufion Hct showed adequate
response with Hct of 31. The plan was for upper GI study one
week after his surgery to assess anastomosis before starting his
diet.

[**2103-10-14**]: Patient was febrile to 101.9. Vancomycin and Zosyn
started for empiric coverage. Patient also developed atrial
fibrillation with HR > 170's. He was not able to convert with
lopressor and became hypotensive despite multiple fluid boluses.
Cardiac enzyme panel were negative. Electrolytes checked and
were repleted. Transferred to the intensive care unit for
symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone started and he
converted to sinus that evening. HIs epidural was removed by APS
for possible bacteremia. He kept on PCA for pain control.

[**2103-10-15**]: Patient with tachypnea secondary to his abdominal
distention. Oxygen saturations were > 93% and blood gases showed
normal gas exchange. Pulmonary toilet with nebulizer to help
with his respiratory status. Patient complained of a "reflux"
that is not GERD-like but exacerbated when he lays flat. With
his constipation and ileus, full bowel regimen with laxatives
started. Golytely started at 40ml/hr via his J-tube to encourage
bowel movements. Patient remained NSR.

[**2103-10-16**] -[**2103-10-18**]: Right picc line provided for additional venous
access while patient remained on amiodarone drip. PIV removed
for phlebilits most likely [**2-17**] amiodarone drug reaction. He
remained NSR. Golytely continued to be fed via J-tube. Patient
able to pass flatus and stool. He was kept on antibiotics for a
incisional wound cellulitus that was indurated, tender and
e
