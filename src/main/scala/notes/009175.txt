History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 year old lady with a PMH of afib, chronic
venostasis, CAD, sCHF, HTN, DM2 and dyslipidemia who was
admitted to an OSH on [**2195-2-8**] w/ afib w/ RVR and pleural
effusion now transferred here for managment of acute
decompensation of systolic and diastolic heart failure.
.
Her initial complaint included increasing abdominal girth and
progressive dyspnea on exertion for the last six months now
apparent at rest.  She had been evaluated by both her PCP and
cardiologist sometime last fall and had been started on
metolazone three months ago without improvement in her symptoms.
.
In the OSH ED, she was found to be in atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response with heart rates in the 140s
associated with nausea. She was given phenergan for management
of her nasuea and subsequently had an anakathisic reponse for
which she was given cogentin.  For her rapid afib she was given
one dose of IV diltiazem after which her SBP dropped to the 70s.
 She was given IV fluids. Her vital signs on admission were 98.0
110-140 98/76 12 96% on RA. Her initial labs were notable for a
sodium of 129, creatiine of 2.0 (baseline 1.1), WBC 9.3 normal
diff, Hmg 1.6, hct 33.9, INR 2.1 and BNP of 874 with CE
significant for CK-MB 4.3 CK 78.  A noncontrast CT of her
abdomen and pelvis demonstrated diffuse soft tissue edema of the
abdominal flanks, moderate right sided pleural effusion and
moderate ascites.  A chest xray showed a right sided pleural
effusion, atelectasis of the right lower lobe and moderate
ascites. She was initially admitted to the general floors
however was transferred to the CCU for low systolic blood
pressures.
.
In the CCU she had an echo demonstrated an EF of 20%,
representing depression since prior known EF of 50% and
biventricular failure. A pulmonary artery catheter was placed
and demonstrated CO 5, SV 50, CVP 26-30, PA diastolic pressure
was 25 abd mean PA pressure was 42.  She was started on
dobutamine and milrinone after which her CO increased to 6.  She
was initially given lasix until low SBPs prompted
discontinuation.  Her beta blocker was held and digoxin
continued. An EKG demonstated a wide QRS, 140 ms. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 41670**] were
significant for RBBB w/ non specific ST changes.
.
Her course at the OSH was complicated by a CXR significatnt for
a right sided pleural effusion and atelectasis of the RLL and
cardiomegally and new oxygen requirement (4L NC) likely in the
setting congestive hear failure.  She was empirically started on
moxifloxacin for CAP. She had acute on chronic renal failure w/
presenting creatinine 2.0 above baseline 1.1, FeURea 8.2
consistent w/ pre-renal state.  A foley was placed w/ UOP 40-60
cc/hr. She was noted to be hyponatremic on admission and was
fluid restricted. She had a single generalized tonic clonic
seizure which resolved spontaneously. Neurology was consulted,
and a CT scan of her head was negative and she was loaded w/
keppra and maintained on 500 [**Hospital1 **].  An EEG final report was
pending at the time of discharge.  Lastly, chronic venous statis
changes were noted on her bilateral lower extremities with
concern for overlying cellulitis.  She was started on
Vancomycin.
.
She was ultimately transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of severe
biventricular heart failure. Vitals on arrival were 96.3 104
117/58 23 98% on 4L NC.  She complained of dyspnea and hip pain.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2195-2-12**]:
FINDINGS: No previous images. Left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter tip
extends to the right pulmonary artery at the outer border of the
mediastinum. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent
on the right.
.
CXR [**2195-2-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Worsened CHF.
.
CXR [**2195-2-14**]:
FINDINGS: This is a markedly rotated film, which limits
comparison to prior.  The heart continues to be moderately
enlarged. Swan-Ganz catheter tip is probably in the pulmonary
outflow tract but is difficult to assess due to rotation of the
film. There continues to be a small-to-moderate right pleural
effusion with pulmonary vascular re-distribution, perihilar
haze, compatible with CHF.
.
CXR [**2195-2-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Slightly improved appearance of the chest.
.
CXR [**2195-2-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
New left PICC line terminating in the left internal jugular
vein. These
findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2195-2-17**] at 10:30

Conclusions
The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. The right ventricular cav
