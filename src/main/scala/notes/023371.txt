Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7934**]
Chief Complaint:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 24855**]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT Abdomen/Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
 1. Large irreular heterogeneously enhancing mass centered in
the mesentery that is inseparable from small bowel resulting
with secondary early high grade small bowel obstruction. Oral
contrast was not administered in this study. The differential
for this mass is extensive and includes maligant or infectious
etiologies, including carcinoid tumor, primary GI stromal tumor,
desmoid tumor, and tuberculosis.  Lymphoma, while less likely,
remains a possibility.

2. Mild anterior wedge compression fracture of L1 vertebral
body, age- indeterminant.

Echocardiogram:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are  normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates  an E/e' <8
suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure (<12mmHg).
 Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic  valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.


History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 47 yo female with a past medical history
significant for Dandy-Walker malformation with shunt placement
for cyst drainage and secondary hydrocephalus with VP shunt, and
HTN who presents with a 1.5 month history of nausea and
vomiting. She says that she vomits about a half hour after she
eats a light meal and right away after a heavy meal. Usually the
vomitus consists of a mix of bile and undigested food. No blood.
She denies abdominal pain, early satiety, fatigue, weight loss,
nightsweats, fever, chills. She sleeps well without
interruption. BM's are less frequent but no BRBPR/melena. CT of
the abdomen was done in the ED on presentation, GI was consulted
and recommends push enteroscopy next week for tissue diagnosis.
NS was consulted and found normal shunt function.
.
On the morning after admission, she was given her (supposed)
home dose of her antihypertensive (Diovan, 160 mg) after which
she dropped her pressure from the 130's into the 60's. She was
subsequently given a litre of NS bolus to which she experienced
flash pulmonary edema with pink, frothy, sputum and desaturation
to 80. She was given 20 of IV lasix with an initial diuresis of
250 cc clear urine with some improvement in her clinical status.
However, she continued to cough pink sputum and to require 6
litres via nasal canula. Her BP remained in the 60's systolic
and she was transfered to the MICU.


Past Medical History:
Dandy Walker Cyst with gait instability
Hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt
HTN
h/o anemia (from surgery exacerbated by menorrhagia)


Social History:
lives at home with mother. Sister, [**Name (NI) 21457**] and nephew live next
door. Good support system. No job (no driver's license) - knits,
reads, TV. No tobacco, EtOH, illicit drugs.

Family History:
: cancers of unknown type on father's side. Father passed MI
@61. Maternal aunt with metastatic lung ca. Mother/sisters with
HTN and DM2.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 47 yo F with Dandy-Walker malformation and hydrocephalus
with shunt,admitted with abd mass of unknown etiology and
respiratory failure
.
#. Respiratory failure
-One week prior to passing, the patient developed sudden
shortness of breath and hypoxemia that required intubation.  Her
imaging and clinical picture was c/w ARDS, likely secondary to
aspiration pneumonia, which then progressed to
fibroproliferative ARDS.  She was difficult to ventilate and
required increasing PEEP, FiO2, however remained acidotic,
hypoxemic, with decreased minute ventilation.
.
#. Hypotension:
-Her hypotension was likely secondary to septic shock from an
intraabdominal process.  Her hypotension was unresponsive to
multiple pressors at maximum doses in addition to fluid boluses.
 Multiple blood and sputum cultures remained negative, however,
she was maintained on Meropenem, Vanc and Flagyl.  She continued
to spike fevers even through the multiple antibiotics.
Eventually, her blood pressure bottomed out despite intensive
therapy.
.
#. Abdominal Mass - CT scan of the abdomen indicates an
partially obstructing abdominal mass either within or adjacent
to the proximal jejunum likely responsible for increased
abdominal pressure and compression of the stomach, causing
nausea and vomiting. Differential includes lymphoma, a primary
GI malignancy, and carcinoid tumor, as well as but more
uncommon, possible ovarian ca mets.  We were unable to reimage
secondary to the patient being unstable.  Surgery was following,
and although they were pushing for resection, she was too
unstable to go to surgery.  WE got daily KUBs and bladder
pressures.
.
#. Dandy- Walker Malformation and Hydrocephalus with shunts -
-VP shunt study showed patency.
.
#. HTN - Hold [**Last Name (un) **] given above
.
# elevated INR
-Labs not c/w DIC, elevated D dimer, and FDP secondary to acute
phase reaction. Likely nutritional vs. antibiotic effect.
.
#. FEN - Because of her prolonged NPO state, she was given TPN
for nutrition.
.
#. Dispo - Deceased
