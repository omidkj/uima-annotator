HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease (status post
coronary artery bypass graft), also with a history of
congestive heart failure, type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism,
and hypertension, who initially presented to the [**Hospital3 **]
clearance because of a C2 fracture back in [**2158-12-23**];
status post a mechanical fall.

She was cleared for surgery and switched from Coumadin to
heparin at the time but requested to go home and have her
surgery electively scheduled for [**2159-7-13**].

had a transoral resection of her odontoid and associated
second soft tissues. She received 2 units of packed red blood
cells and was extubated and given high-dose narcotics for
pain management.

On [**7-16**], she had a hypercarbic respiratory failure with an
arterial blood gas demonstrating 7.02/99/134.  She then had
two episodes of bradycardia secondary to vagal stimuli, and a
pulseless electrical activity/asystole arrest.  She was
brought back from both codes, and Electrophysiology was
consulted.

Electrophysiology placed a pacer wire (temporary).  She was
also maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics for lower
extremity cellulitis.

On [**7-24**], she was transferred from the Surgery Service to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management of
renal failure as well as difficulty to wean.  Her Medical
Intensive Care Unit course was complicated by worsening
mental status and ongoing acute renal failure.

Her mental status was questionably attributed to narcosis
versus uremia, and her narcotics were held at this time.  On
[**7-27**], a CT scan of her head was obtained for just ongoing
mental status changes.  A massive cerebral hemorrhage was
noted at the time obstructing the fourth ventricle.

Neurosurgery was consulted and a ventriculostomy drain was
placed at the bedside.  However, the patient remained in
neurogenic shock and continued to demonstrate
unresponsiveness by all objective clinical measures.  She
remained pressor-dependent to keep her mean arterial pressure
greater than 70.

Her code status was changed to do not resuscitate/do not
intubate on [**2159-7-29**].  She remained in neurogenic shock.
Her apnea test was positive for corneal reflexes and
pupillary reflexes were absent.

At 3:45 p.m., on [**7-29**], the patient was found to be
unresponsiveness following a cardiac arrest.  She expired at
this time.  The family denied postmortem examinations.
