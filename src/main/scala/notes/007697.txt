Chief Complaint:
cough and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 64 yo male with h/o CAD s/p CABG, DM, CHF with EF
20 % p/w cough, lethargy, chills, SOB and right sided
back/scapular pain x 2 days. Mr. [**Known lastname **] noticed that he was more
lethargic over the past 2 days and wanted to sleep more. He also
noticed some right scapular "muscle pain" which he treated with
icy hot and massage. On the evening of admission he developed
cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, SOB and chills and
presented to the ED. He denied CP, PND, orthopnea, recent
increasing DOE, LE edema. He has been taking all of his
medications as directed. Denies sick contacts.
.
In the ED RIJ was placed and patient recieved 5 liters NS and
levaquin 750 mg x1 with SBPs in 70s-80s and dopamine was
started. He subsequently devloped respiratory distress and CP
after fluid resuscitation and was given lasix 40 mg IV x1 and
morphine 2 mg IV x1 and his dopamine was was decreased to 20
cc/hr. He was placed on 100% NRB but remained conversant with
improvement in his breathing after the lasix satting 100%. On
transfer BP 104/52, HR 105, RR 18, O2 sat 100% on 100% NRB 5

AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: A dual lead left chest wall
pacemaker is seen in unchanged position from prior exam. The
cardiac silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
The patient is status post median sternotomy. There is a new
consolidation at the inferior aspect of the right upper lobe.
The left lung is clear. There are no effusions. The surrounding
soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: New consolidation at the inferior aspect of the
right upper lobe concerning for pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Sepsis: Patient was hypotensive, tachycardic, febrile with WBC
16.9 with 12 % bands. Initial lactate was 4.5 and improved with
fluid resusciation to 2.0. Given CXR findings, cough, and SOB
most likely source is community acquired PNA. UA and blood
cultures were negative. Patient responded well to goal directed
therapy with some volume overload. He was weaned off levophed
with SBPs in 120s.  He will complete a total 10 day course of
levofloxacin for treatment of his pneumonia.
 .
# Community acquired pneumonia: Patient improved on levofloxacin
with scheduled nebs and an incentive spirometer.  He will
complete a 10 day course of levofloxacin for treatment.  He was
weaned off oxygen and stable on room air, including with
ambulation by the time of discharge.  He is s/p the influenza
vaccine but was administered the pneumovax prior to discharge.
.
# CHF (EF 25%): Patient became more short of breath with an
increasing O2 requirement after fluid resuscitation in the
emergency room.  His subjective symptoms and oxygen saturation
improved considerably with diuresis. He ruled out for acute
coronary syndrome with serial cardiac enzymes.  He was continued
on his home dose of lasix and diuresed well.  He will have his
creatinine rechecked on Monday to confirm this remains stable in
the setting of his ongoing diuresis.  He was restarted on his
home spironolactone at the time of discharge and was continued
on all of his regular antihypertensives while in house.  His
blood pressure is under good control and he is euvolemic at the
time of discharge.
.
# Acute renal failure:  Resolved with volume repletion.
Patient's creatinine remained stable with diuresis following
volume overload.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was initially held but was
restarted prior to discharge.  His allopurinol has been renally
dosed.
.
# History of recurrent lower extremity DVT:  Patient was
initially admitted with an INR of 4.0.  His coumadin was held
until his INR improved.  He was discharged home on coumadin 7 mg
po qhs with plans for a repeat INR on Monday.  His INR on the
day of discharge was 1.2.
.
# CAD: No evidence of active ischemia on EKG and no CP. Cardiac
enzymes were unremarkable.  Patient is on a statin, BB, and [**Last Name (un) **].
 He has not tolerated ASA in the past, while on coumadin due to
GI bleeding.
.
# Insulin dependent diabetes: Patient was initially started on
an insulin drip, given his high insulin requirements at home.
He was then switched to a sliding scale of humalog but only
required approximately 70-80 units total per day x 2 days (at
home taking 80 units of 70/30 [**Hospital1 **]).  Likely this was due to a
strict diabetic diet while in house and possibly decreased
insulin clearance in the setting of his recovering renal
function.  Thus, patient was discha
