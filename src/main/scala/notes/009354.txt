Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Carbapenem

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension s/p cardiac arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Rigid bronchoscopy with argon therapy
2. Endotracheal Intubation
3. Bronchial embolization: A-gram showed patchy blush in the
region of LUL --> embolized with gelfoam.

History of Present Illness:
 72 y/o female with h/o NSCLC s/p radiation, PE s/p IVC filter,
DM, htn, COPD admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2199-7-24**] for persistent
hemoptysis. She was initially evaluated at OSH for NSCLC
diagnosed by biopsy. She was also found to have PEs and was
started on anticoagulation.  However, then developed hemoptysis
and anticoagulation was stopped which was followed by IVC filter
placement.   Patient then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation of persistent hemoptysis.
.
Today, patient went to the OR with Interventional Pulmonary for
rigid bronchoscopy.  Patient was found to have bleeding in LUL
and L lingula.  L lingular bleeding was treated with 3 rounds of
argon laser coagulation which patient tolerated well.  OR course
was otherwise uncomplicated except for a brief episode of
hypotension treated with phenylephrine, attributed to propofol.
She was in and out of Afib and sinus on tele. Patient then
received a final round of argon therapy. However, following
final laser treatment, patient lost O2 pleuth and there was
concern for ansent pulses although there is question of whether
she maintained a faint carotid pulse.  CPR was initiated and
patient received atropine and epinephrine boluses.  A femoral
CVL was placed along with an a-line.  Pulses were regained but
pressures remained low.  An intraoperative TEE showed air in the
RA, RV, LV, aorta, and RCA.  TEE also showed clot in the RA and
severe biventricular systolic dysfunction.
.
Patient was treated with epinephrine gtt and levophed gtt with
improvement in his BPs.  She was noted to be in Afib at that
time and was given 150 mg of amiodarone with conversion to sinus
rhythm but also further drop in her blood pressures requiring
increase in her epinephrine gtt. Bleeding continued in the LUL
and her R Mainstem bronchus was selectively intubated (23 at the
lip. at 24, tube occludes RUL. At 22, no longer selective R
bronchus intubation).  Following resusitation, TEE showed
resolutiion of air in RCA and improved biventricular function.
She was then transferred to the ICU for further managment.

OP Report: Bronchoscopy [**2199-7-25**]
Surgeon:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], [**MD Number(1) 42548**]
ASSISTANT:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 74204**] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with
argon plasma coagulation.
INDICATIONS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 74205**] has been recently diagnosed with
non-small cell lung cancer s/p X-RT and presents with massive
hemoptysis, worsening over the last 1 day, from an outside
hospital. The
procedure is being performed for airway evaluation and
control of hemoptysis.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  Informed consent was obtained from the
patient after explaining the risks and benefits of the
procedure. She was placed supine on the operating table and
general anesthesia was initiated. She was intubated without
difficulty with a 12.2/13.2 rigid bronchoscope. Jet
ventilation was initiated. Initial evaluation revealed frank
blood in the trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi which was
suctioned clean. Evaluation of the right-sided airways did
not reveal any evidence of active bleeding. Frank bleeding was
seen to originate from the left upper lobe. The rigid
bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem bronchus
to isolate
the lung. Using a flexible bronchoscope, an argon plasma
coagulation probe was advanced into the left upper lobe and
coagulation was performed x3. The patient continued to bleed
. While repeat APC was being performed, the patient developed
acute ST segments on the EKG monitoring and the procedure was
discontinued. She remained intubated with the rigid bronchoscope
while the cardiac status was stabilized. However, she progressed
to PEA/cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation. The rigid
bronchoscope was removed and she was easily intubated over a
Cook
catheter with an endotracheal tube #7. Using the flexible
bronchoscope, the endotracheal tube was advanced into the
right mainstem bronchus to isolate the left lung. The patient
also received epinephrine and norepinephrine for blood
pressure support. CPR was performed for aproximately 1-2min,
until
spontaneous return of circulation. A transesophageal
echocardiogram performed in the operating room [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
failure, blood clot in RAand PA, gas in aorta and small PFO.
The patient was transferred in a critical condition to the
intensive care unit for further care.
IMPRESSION/COMPLICATIONS:
1. Lung Cancer
2. Massive hemoptysis
3. PEA arrest secondary to Gas embolism/ Pulmonary embolism.
3. Biventricular failure.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2199-7-26**]
HISTORY:  72-year-old woman status post air embolus in aorta and
status post cardiac arrest, now with decreased mental status.
Assess for CVA.
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained
without the
administration of IV contrast.
COMPARISON:  There were no prior studies for comparison.
FINDINGS:  There is marked effacement of the sulci and loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation.  The ventricular system as well as the basal
cisterns are not visualized.  There is evidence of a tonsillar
herniation.  This is consistent with anoxic brain injury with
diffuse cerebral edema.
There is no definite evidence of hemorrhage.
IMPRESSION:
1.  There is diffuse effacement of the sulci and loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation with effacement of the ventricular system and
basal cisterns. There is also evidence of tonsillar herniation.
This is consistent with anoxic brain injury and diffuse cerebral
swelling.
