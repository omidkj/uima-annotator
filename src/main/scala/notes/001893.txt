Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, SOB with exertion and left sided chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial drainage with pigtail catheter
Left thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 46 y/o man with a hx of positive PPD, and a recently
diagnosed NSCLC who presents with 3 day hx of weakness, SOB with
exertion and left sided chest pain which radiates to his back
and he describes saying "it feels like someone is poking me." He
reports that his cough is not productive of sputum, but that
when he coughs, he feels like he needs to vomit. This cough is
unchanged from the cough he has had since [**Month (only) **]. He estimates
that from his last admission he has lost apporximately 10
pounds. He denies fever, dizziness, light-headedness, HA, abd
pain, leg pain, leg swelling.
.
Pt was healthy until [**Month (only) **] when he began to notice blood in
his sputum. He also reported night sweats and weight loss, but
denied fever and shortness of breath. A chest CT was performed
in [**11-15**] which showed a 3.1 x 1.7 cm cavitary mass in the
superior segment of the right lower lobe in addition to multiple
large mediastinal lymph nodes. There were also several lytic
lesions in the thoracic and lumbar spine which were concerning
for metastases. Given the pt's hx of a positive PPD, pt was also
evaluated for TB. Spirometry was performed and was consistent
with a severe obstructive defect. Sputum cytology was negative
for AFB and malignant cells but transbronchial needle aspiration
showed atypical epithelioid and inflammatory cells suspicious
for malignancy and precarinal LN and bronchial washings were
both positive for malignant cells, consistent with NSCLC.
.
In the ED, the pt was found to have an elevated pulsus paradoxus
at 15-20. An echo showed a large echodense pericardial effusion
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There was RV diastolic collapse, consistent with tamponade. In
the cath lab, 1500cc of grossly bloody pericardial fluid was
drained and a pericardial drain was sutured in place. A repeat
echo showed that the effusion had decreased in size and the RV
collapse had resolved. The pericardial fluid cytology was
positive for malignant cells consistent with non-small cell
metastatic carcinoma.
.
The pt was also found by CXR to have a large consolidation in
the left lower lobe with small bilateral pleural effusions, and
evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for further monitoring.

In the MICU, pt was treated with CTX/azithromycin for his L.
lobe PNA. His repeat ECHO showed greatly decreased size of
pericardial effusion and the pericardial drain was pulled. Pt no
longer complains of any SOB. In the MICU, pt has also had 2
episodes of episode of A-fib. The first episode was reverted to
sinus rhythm with amiodarone. Lopressor was added after the
second episode. Amiodarone was continued as pt will likely
continue to be at risk for further episodes of a-fib. Finally,
the pt had thoracentesis before coming to the floor.

Past Medical History:
1. Positive PPD last month.
2. Asthma.
3. No history of hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery
disease.


Social History:
Born and raised in [**Country 651**] and came to the United States in [**2100**].
He works in construction, primarily installing sheetrock and
plumbing. Reports possible exposure to asbestos  and other
chemicals.
Lives with wife and 2 daughters
[**Name (NI) **] smoked one to two packs of cigarettes a day for 22 years,
however, quit two to three years ago.
He drinks alcohol socially.


Family History:
His father died at 67 from an unknown cause. His mother is 73
and alive and well. He has two brothers and one sister, who are

also healthy.


Physical Exam:
Exam: 98.1 (100.8 in ED), BP 115/80, HR 118, R 28, O2 100% on
NRB
Gen: ill appearing but no acute distress
HEENT: EOMI, MMM
Neck: elevated JVD
CV: tachy, regular, no murmur
Chest: decreased breath sounds at left base with bronchial
breath sounds; decreased breath sounds at right apex
Abd: +BS, soft, NT
Ext: trace edema bilaterally, 2+ DP
Neuro: 5/5 strength in upper and lower ext bilaterally


Pertinent Results:
Chest CT [**11-15**]:
* A 3 cm spiculated mass with cavitation, adjacent tethering and
pleural thickening with multiple enlarged conglomerate lymph
nodes, most worrisome for primary pulmonary neoplasm and less
likely infection.
* Scattered lytic lesions in the thoracic spine, worrisome for
metastases.
* Moderate pericardial effusion.
.
Studies:
[**12-31**]
AP CXR -
1.  Left lower lobe pneumonia.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**12-31**] EKG
Sinus tachycardia
Atrial premature complexes
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
Indeterminate QRS axis
Generalized low voltage
Modest right ventricular conduction delay pattern
Findings are nonspecific but suggest in part chronic pulmonary
disease or possible ventricular overload
No previous tracing available for comparison
.
[**1-1**] ECHO
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF:50-55%).
3.The aortic valve is not well seen.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5.There is a large pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo
dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with
impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
.
[**1-1**] Post-Procedure ECHO
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 45% to 55% (nl >=55%)
Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity  size is normal. The views are limited but
the overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed with global hypokinesis.
2.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
3.There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. No rightventricular diastolic collapse is
seen.
.
[**1-1**] CXR
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of the earlier study of [**1-1**], the pericardial effusion is much
less but remains moderate.
Large left sided pleural effusion present.
Decrease in the size of the cardiac silhouette. However, it
remains enlarged. This is consistent with the
pericardiocentesis. There is overlying catheter seen across the
left chest.  There remains a persistent left retrocardiac
opacity which opacifies the left lower half of the chest. There
is an opacity seen within the right base which is better seen on
today's study.
