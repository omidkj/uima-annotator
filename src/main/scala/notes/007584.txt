Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 41017**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
73-year-old male with a history of CAD, status post CABG and AVR
presents with 1 week of acute dyspnea in the setting of
progressive DOE X 3-4yrs. Cardiac evaluation yielded three
vessel disease and AS, status post AVR/CABG in [**6-19**].  Since then
has had persistent DOE.  States that becomes SOB after 600 yrds
walking or with walking up any incline.  +PND.  Sleeps on 2
pillows.  Admitted last month after 1 wk of CP--> stress test
showed large reversible defect.  He was then admitted for cath
which showed diffuse disease with patent LIMA and occluded
SVG-PDA.  Patient was taken for 2nd cath to complete possible
intervention but procedure aborted due to TIA. Sent home after
short CCU stay. His first cardiac cath of the aforementioned
yielded: PCWP 12, PA 28/12, RV 27/7, RA 6, CO 5.5, PVR 116.

Since that admission, the patient had ongoingdyspnea and has
been worked up for dyspnea by CT scans x2 at NEBH which showed
pleural plaques and LLL mass vs. rounded atelectasis.  Also had
low prob V/Q scan.  PFTs at NEBH in [**12-21**]: FEV1 55%, FVC55%,
Ratio 66%, TLC 56%(?), RV 60%, DLCO 44%.

Pt states that he has been more short of breath over the last 1
month.  Started on bronchodilators last week and Singulair. DOE
has progressed and is now with minimal exertion.  Cough
productive of occ white sputum for last 1 wk.  No F/C.  Also has
been wheezing for week prior to admission as well.

1. CAD s/p CABG as above, c/b ascending aorta aneurysm
2. s/p AVR
3. HTN

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-2-27**] : Large new bilateral
retroperitoneal hematomas since the prior study, also a small
anterior rectus sheath hematoma. Given the bilaterality, and
lack of evidence of hematoma surrounding the aortic aneurysm,
the appearance is most consistent with spontaneous
retroperitoneal hemorrhages.

unchanged from previous. Left-sided aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm
in the thoracic aorta, unchanged from previous. Pleural plaques,
unchanged from previous. Bilateral retroperitoneal hemorrhage
with hematoma formation, slightly decreased from previous. No
evidence of new disease or acute intraabdominal pathology.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.

## From a Respiratory Standpoint:
   - Probable Asthma
   - Restrictive Lung Disease (Pleural Asbestos-related Plaques)
   - LLL mass

Pulmonary consultation was sought on admission.  Clinical
presention was most notable for bronchospastic disease.  He was
treated w/ steroids (intially solumedrol, then prednisone
taper), bronhcodilators.  Advair was initiated. Probable asthma
