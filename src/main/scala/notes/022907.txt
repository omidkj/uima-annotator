Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1674**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute cholangitis, e.coli bacteremia, acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, ercp, central line placements

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78835**] is an 80M with PMH HTN who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**6-26**] with a three day history of nausea, vomiting,
and abdominal pain. On admission labs he was found to have a
leukocytosis to 13.4 and was febrile to 102. He also had an
elevated bilirubin to 6.8, a mild transaminitis, and was noted
to be in renal failure with a cr up to 4.1 He underwent MRCP as
there was concern for cholangitis in the setting of fevers,
jaundice and abdominal pain. Initially the MRCP was read as
negative, however, when the gastroenterologist and surgeon
re-evaluated it they had higher suspicion for CBD dilation with
a small CBD stone. Blood cultures later turned positive for gram
negative rods. He was given a dose of zosyn 2.25mg q8H, bolused
~4L of ormal saline. He was transiently hypotensive to systolic
BP in the 80s, which resolved with fluids. He is being
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.

Past Medical History:
HTN
Abdominal hernia repair
TIA
Bilateral TAH
CKD with b/l Cr 1.3-1.6

Social History:
No ETOH, smoking, or drug use. Has a fiance and 2 daughters who
are also his HCP.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Please cut and past from metavision H&P

Pertinent Results:
[**6-28**] ERCP

FINDINGS: Five fluoroscopic spot images obtained during ERCP
without a radiologist present. These demonstrate multiple
filling defects in the distal common bile duct, consistent with
choledocholithiasis. Intrahepatic bile ducts appear normal. By
report, stones were extracted successfully using a 15-mm
balloon.

IMPRESSION: Choledocholithiasis, with successful balloon
extraction during ERCP.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o M admitted with acute cholangitis s/p ERCP with removal
of stones and sludge.

# Acute cholangitis/Sepsis

Patient was febrile to 103 at outside hospital and transiently
hypotensive, sys bp 78, with 4/4 blood cultures growing E.coli
which was sensitive to ampicillin. Blood pressure was responsive
to fluid resuscition. Patient was switched to ampicillin after
being initially on piperacillin/tazobactam, no subsequent blood
cultures were positive. He completed a 10 day course of
ampicillin. Patient underwent ERCP with removal of stones and
sludge, was intubated peri-ERCP.
-  Follow up: needs to make appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 468**] of
surgery to evaluate need for cholecystectomy
.
# Respiratory

Patient was intubated prior to ERCP, he was unable to be
extubated secondary to pulmonary edema, altered mental status
thought to be due to uremia and sedating medications. He was
started on HD in hopes of clearing his mental status in order to
extubate. Patient developed VAP due to prolonged intubation. He
was treated with vancomycin and cefepime for 8 day course. He
was successfully extubated without complication once mental
status improved and he underwent ultrafiltration for fluid
removal improving his pulmonary edema.  He intermittently
requires oxygen supplementation prior to dialysis.
.
# Acute renal failure

Baseline creatinine 1.3-1.6; Creatinine trended upwards thought
to be due to ATN in setting of sepsis and hypotension. Patient's
mental status became altered secondary to uremia. He was then
started on dialysis. Mental status improved following dialysis
but he still required dialysis 3 x week. He was initially
oliguric but then was able to maintain urine output of 30cc/
hour. Patient was started on lanthanum, sevelamer and aluminum
hydroxide for elevated phosphorus of 9. He was dialyzed
T/Th/Sat.
---Please note:  Pt likely needs long term dialysis.  If you
need help coordinating outpt dialysis placement after discharge
from [**Hospital1 **], please [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name 12906**] [**Location (un) 12907**] at [**Hospital3 **],
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**] pager [**Numeric Identifier 78836**].

# Atrial fibrillation

Patient developed atrial fib with RVR to 180s post ERCP which
required amiodarone gtt and transition to oral regimen. This was
new in the setting of sepsis and stress response. Patient went
back into sinus rhythym after bacteremia was treated and
amiodarone was hence stopped. He was not placed on
anticoagulation given he was back in sinus and this was
transient atrial fibrillation related to an acute process.
.
# Anemia

Patient hematocrit was noted to trend down. Iron studies
demonstrated iron deficiency as well as anemia of chronic
disease. Patient is receiving iron transfusions, last dose of
ferrous gluconate is [**2116-7-19**]. HCT ranged between 23-28. Last
blood transfusion [**2116-7-16**].

# Hypertension

Currently on lopressor and well controlled. Actually drops with
dialysis and so midodrine started for prior to dialysis. Home
meds included triamterine/HCTZ. This was not restarted.

# Dementia:

Pt oriented to self and place.  Short term memory loss.  CT of
head without acute changes.  Unclear whether this is due to
effects of prior sepsis.

# Congestive Heart Failure, systolic, left: Echo done during
sepsis with LV hypokinesis, EF 40%, mildly improved on day of
discharge.  Continue beta blocker, consider starting aspirin.
