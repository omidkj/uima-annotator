History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 71 yo female with hx of DM, HTN, Dyspnea of unclear
origin on 2 liters home oxygen who presents with worsening
shortness of breath over the last 4 months.
.
Patient states that her shortness of breath has been a chronic
issue and no one has ever given her a diagnosis to explain the
symptoms. She notes that she has been on oxygen at home for
years. Over the past 4 months she has appreciated gradual
worsening in her shortness of breath. She denies any event prior

she chronically has shortness of breath with acitivity. Denies
cough. Denies phlegm production. Denies recent increase in
swelling in lower extremity or abdomen. Further patient denies
recent travel, sick contacts. Denies recent fevers or chills.
.
Pt does note for the past 3-4 months she has had nausea on and
off leading to occasional emesis. This typically occurs in the
morning. Further she endorses loose stools twice daily for 4
months.
.
Today patient was fed up with her breathing so decided to call
an ambulance to be evaluated in the emergency department. In the
ED the patient triggered for hypoxia. Initially pt sat 92-93% on
6L NC. Pt desatted to 88% and was placed on non rebreather. CXR
there was thought to be a left sided hazziness and pt got
ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Labs revealed an elevated proBNP
elevated and Troponin 0.05 with Flat CK. Lactate 4.4. Pt was
also given lasix 40mg IV x one.  EKG with ST 101 RAD NSST new
TWI avf, V1-4.  Vitals prior to transfer: 96.9 97 111/69 24 92
on nRB.
.
On the floor,  pt is comfortable with non rebreather, satting in
the high 90s. She feels that her breathing is much better than
this morning.

Studies:
[**2199-7-11**] TTE: Marked right ventricular cavity enlargement with
free wall hypokinesis and pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Right-to-left intracardiac shunt at the atrial
level.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-10-23**],
the findings are new and suggestive of an acute pulmonary
process (e.g., pulmonary embolism).

[**2199-7-11**] CTA Chest: Filling defect in the right middle and
segmental branches of the right lower lobe pulmonary arteries
compatible with acute pulmonary embolus. Additional filling
defect in subsegmental branches of the left lower lobe.
Flattening of the interventricular septum and reflux of contrast
into hepatic veins could indicate a component of right
ventricular strain. Small rounded opacity at the right lung base
(3:70) may represent infarcted tissue. Dependent bibasilar
atelectasis. Multiple sub-cm mediastinal lymph nodes. Fatty
liver. Stable low density focus in the left adrenal gland could
represent an adenoma.

[**2199-7-11**] LENI's:
Please note the exam is technically limited due to patient body
habitus.
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common
femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained
demonstrating normal flow, compressibility, augmentation, and
waveforms. No intraluminal thrombus is present. Calf veins could
not be evaluated.
  IMPRESSION:
No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Pt is a 71 yo female with hx of DM, HTN,
Dyspnea of unclear origin on 2 liters home oxygen who presents
with worsening shortness of breath over the last 4 months, and
found to have bilateral PE's with RV strain. She was initially
admitted to the MICU.
.
#. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: On admission, it was found that she has had
progressive shortness of breath over the past 3 months. She had
an elevated white blood cell count however had not been febrile.
A CXR was without infiltrate. CXR and PFTs in [**2197**] without
evidence of COPD. Pt likely has component of OSA which is
contributing to pulmonary disease. A CTA on [**2199-7-10**]
demonstrated RLL and possible LLL PE's. A TTE on [**7-11**],
demonstrated RV strain. She was started on heparin gtt; however,
she was not therapeutic on heparin gtt for several hours and was
started on therapeutic lovenox and coumadin.  She was also
diuresed with lasix which
