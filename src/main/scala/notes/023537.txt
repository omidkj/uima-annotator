Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery was
consulted given her low GCS at scene of crash. She underwent
serial head CT scans which did not reveal any intracranial
hemorrhage. MR imaging did reveal evidence of diffuse axonal
injury. No further recommendations from Neurosurgery was
offered.

She remained in the ICU vented and minimally responsive despite
sedation being discontinued. The decision was made for
tracheostomy and PEG placement after discussion with her family.
She was eventually weaned off of the ventilator. Over the course
of a couple of days following this she was noted to be
responsive to simple commands. At this point she was tolerating
her tube feeds at goal. She was transferred to the regular
nursing unit where she continued to slowly show signs of
increased responsiveness.

She was treated with a seven day course of Levaquin for a
pneumonia; course completed on [**3-9**].

She was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is
being recommended for acute head injury rehab.  She is being
discharged today to rehab in stable condition.
