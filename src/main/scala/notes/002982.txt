Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 25788**] is an 83-year-old woman with a history of peripheral
vascular disease, hypertension, osteoporosis, and alcohol abuse
with a history of alcohol withdrawal who presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Location (un) 620**] on [**2201-1-17**] with 2 days of shortness of breath, malaise,
dry cough, chest pain, and myalgia. She had been feeling poorly
and had been taking ibuprofen around the clock for 2 days. Per
her daughter, the patient was confused the morning of admission
and this resolved after oxygen supplementation in the ED. In the
ED, she received levofloxacin and then started on ceftriaxone
for CAP.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 25788**] was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 **]-N and ruled out for MI but
was seen by cardiology in consult for atrial tachycardia. She
was placed on amiodarone which did not control the pulse
initially, so she was placed on digoxin as well. Dig was
evenutally held for bradycardia. She also had elevated calcium
to 11.4 once corrected for albumin thought [**2-23**] to dehydration.
Therefore, calcium and vitamin D were held. Urine electrolytes
were monitored, and she had a low FENa of 0.4%, and IV hydration
continued and they felt she was clinically dry. Spiked temp to
100.2, blood cultures obtained, repeated CXR.
Echocardiogram showed an EF of 30%-35% and, therefore, Zestril
was restarted. However, the patient's creatinine bumped up to
2.0 on [**2201-1-23**]. Therefore, the Zestril was held.
Patient's daughter requested on [**1-23**] in the am to have patient
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Upon transfer VS: BP 148/67 HR 65 T 97.9 96%on 3L R 20.
.
Currently, patient feels well. She denied shortness of breath,
fever or chills. She denied chest pain but said she had some in
a band like pattern when she was first admitted to the hospital
that has resolved. She also said she had a cough earlier in
admission productive of yellow sputum. Upon further questioning,
she had some epigastric abdominal pain and endorsed
constipation, not recalling last bowel movement.
.
ROS:: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

[**2201-1-23**] CXR:Evidence of failure and effusions.
[**2201-1-23**] LENIs neg for DVT
[**2201-1-23**] RUQ US . Normal liver. No evidence of intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. 2. Right kidney is small with
cortical thinning consistent with chronic medical renal disease.
3. Patent main portal and hepatic veins.
[**2201-1-24**] CT chest/abd/pelvis1. Bilateral pleural effusions with
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. 2. Mild enlargement of the
left kidney with perinephric stranding. Study is limited
secondary to lack of IV contrast, however, findings may be
secondary to pyelonephritis and correlation with UA is
suggested. 3. Bilateral adnexal cysts as described. When patient
has improved a pelvic ultrasound can be performed for further
evaluation.
[**2201-1-26**]  Renal U/S Right renal atrophy with prominent cortical
thinning and lack of Doppler flow, renal artery stenosis cannot
be excluded. Patient could not tolerate Doppler examination.
Normal left kidney.
[**2201-1-26**] CT head No evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction.
However, MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive
in the evaluation for acute infarct.
[**2201-1-27**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-30 %); the
anterior septum appears akinetic and somewhat fibrotic. There is
no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
[**2201-1-27**] CXR: There is stable moderate sized bilateral pleural
effusions with mild atelectasis at the left lung base. Overall,
there is no change.
