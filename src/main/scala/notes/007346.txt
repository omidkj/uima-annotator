Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed, AAA, pneumomediastinum, [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear, L hip fx

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF [**2190-1-20**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]


History of Present Illness:
86 M w/ pmh of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, PMR on chronic steroids, known
AAA, osteoporosis, prostate CA who presented to BINeedham on
[**1-14**] after fall resulting in L hip pain. Pt stated he was in his
USOH on [**1-14**] when he slipped and fell on the ice in his back
yard, landing on his left hip and left elbow. He denies head
trauma or LOC. He denied preceeding symptoms including chest
pain, SOB, lightheadedness or palpitations.

On presentation to [**Location (un) 620**] VS 97.7 BP 165/73 HR64 RR 16 02 100%
RA. He was found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture on
plain film. On [**1-14**] the patient experienced an episode of coffee
ground emesis, he was evaluated by GI (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23233**] and had an
EGD which revealed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear which was cauterized,
there were two non-bleeding AVMs seen in the duodenum. His Hct
remained stable around 39 during his stay. He remained HD stable
and maintained on nexium IV. The pt underwent an abd CT scan for
history of AAA which showed slight interval enlargement of an
infrarenal intraabdominal aortic aneurusm from 5cm in [**5-/2188**] to
5.4 cm. Pt also noted to have pneumomediastinum and gas within
the distal esophagus and proximal gastric wall presumed to be
related to M-W tear. + Distended bowel loops. He was started on
Zosyn for the pneumomediastinum and kept NPO. He was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding his AAA. He complained of and pain and
distention. Attributed to his dilated loops of bowel, an NGT was
placed. Given the GIB and AAA pt was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for for
hip repair.

On ROS pt currently c/o abd pain, points to lower abdomen.
Describes as spasms that he has been having for the past 2 days
since his fall. States he has not had a bowel movement since
then, nor has he been passing gas. Slight HA, no vision changes
(other than related to cataract surgery 4 days ago). Had n/v at
OSH, none now. Denies any chest discomfort or SOB, mild stable
DOE at home, no orthopnea or PND. + occ heartburn. No dysuria.
No fevers or chills.

ICU to ICU transfer for mgmt of GIB, and hip fx.

Pertinent Results:
[**1-16**] Hip film:FINDINGS: There is a comminuted fracture involving
the intertrochanteric region of the left femur. Angulation.

[**1-17**] CTA: 1. Small subsegmental pulmonary embolus within the
left lower lobe.
2. Patchy opacities within the right upper lobe and left lower
lobe which may represent aspiration. Consolidative process
within the right lung apex which may represent aspiration versus
atelectasis. Recommend followup to resolution in [**3-6**] weeks after
appropriate antibiotic treatment.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis
marginally increased since prior exam.
4. Trace pneumomediastinum, improved compared to prior exam.
5. Compression fractures of the thoracic spine, likely chronic.

[**1-19**] TTE: Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2187-12-10**], estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is now higher.


Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly this is an 86M with PMH of CAD s/p CABG, PMR on
steroids, osteoporosis and [**Hospital **] transfered from OSH with
traumatic hip fx after developing UGIB.

# Rhythm:On admission was in sinus tach, after trip to radiology
for imagining went into AF with RVR intermitently with SVT.
Overnight was persistently tachycardic, rare breaks into sinus,
mostly AF/Aflutter.
-pt on diltiazem drip, transitioned to PO metoprolol for rate
control
-TTE showed nl LV function, LA not enlarged
-Pt on heparin gtt with transition to coumdin.
-TSH elevated, FT4 WNL
-CEs negative, no evidence for myocardial strain in setting of
rate stress.

#Hypoxemia. Per records and pt history there is no history of
lung disease, pt is not on home 02. On arrival to ED at [**Location (un) 620**],
was 100% on RA. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] was 91% on RA, 97-100% on
70% face mask. Started on heparin overnight both for AF and
suspicion of PE. CTA showed small sub segmental LLL PE.
-heparin gtt, transitioned to coumadin
-LENIs showed no DVT

#UGIB. Per OSH records, pt developed abdominal discomfort at
around noon on [**1-15**] and proceeded to have coffee ground emesis.
Underwent EGD which showed 2 small non-bleeding AVMs in bulb,
[**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear with protruding vessel in distal esophagus,
non-bleeding, was injected with epi and cauterized. Pt was
started on IV PPI and kept NPO. Pt arrives at [**Hospital1 18**] with NGT in
place. Hct had decreased from 44 to 38, was not transfused. Pt
remained HD stable. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], Hct 42. Hct has stayed
stable o/n, pt pulled out his NGT, has had no episodes of coffe
ground emesis or abd pain.
-HCT stable in house, no further evidence bleeding, pt
transitioned to PO PPI

#Hip Fx. s/p ORIF with Dr, [**Name (NI) **] on [**1-20**].  No complications.
WBAT, working with PT prior to d/c.  Will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks for f/u x-rays and suture removal.

#Abd distention. Pt reports no bowel movements since before his
fall, also denying passing gas. Had NGT tube placed at OSH for
decompression in setting of abd distention and dilated loops of
bowel on CT scan. Continues to have dilated, tympanitic abd,
however BS are present, abd is non-tender. ? partial ileus in
setting of opiod use. KUB showed impressive colon dilation with
stool in rectal vault. Pt s/p rectal decompression overnight
with lactulose enema and rectal tube with significant decr
