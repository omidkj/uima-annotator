Chest pain

History of Present Illness:
This 70 year old male presented to the ED with complaints of
tightness in his chest. He woke up this morning feeling normal
and then after moving around the house developed substernal
chest pressure that radiated to his left arm. He took 3
nitroglycerin and waited one hour and called the paramedics. On
arrival they  obtained an EKG that suggested an inferior STEMI.
They gave more nitroglycerin and brought him to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was
brought to the cardiac catheterization lab and was found to have
three vessel disease and is now being referred to cardiac
surgery for revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2188-3-10**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated a three vessel disease. The
LMCA had a 40% stenosis. The LAD had a 95% stenosis at
bifurcation of major diagonal. The LCX had a 100% stenosis at
the origin with excellent left to left collaterals to two large
OMs. The RCA had a 90% proximal with possible thrombus. There
was also a 60% stenosis as well. 2. Resting hemodynamics
demonstrated mildly elevated biventricular filling pressures
with an RVEDP of 10 mmHg and LVEDP 23mmHg. There was mild
pulmonary hypertension with PASP 34mmHg. The PCW was 10mmHg. The
cardiac output was low normal with CI of 2.34 L/min/m2 (using an
assumed oxygen consumption). There was no gradient across the
aortic valve upon pullback. 3. Left ventriculography was
deferred.
[**2188-3-10**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA 60-69%
stenosis.
.
[**2188-3-11**] Intra-op echo, Conclusions:
PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricle displays normal free wall
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in
the operating room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS There is normal biventricular systolic function.
Valvular function appears unchanged. The thoracic aorta is
intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 94918**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-3-10**] for further
management of his chest pain and myocardial infarction. He
underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three
vessel disease. The cardiac surgical service was consulted and
Mr. [**Known lastname 94918**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. A
carotid ultrasound showed Right ICA <40% stenosis and Left ICA
60-69% stenosis.

The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2188-3-11**] where
he underwent Coronary Artery Bypass x 5.   Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.

On POD 1 the patient was weaned from the ventilator on Precedex
for agitation.  The patient was weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support over the following days.  He had delirium
initially, Zyprexa was started and narcotics were held.  This
cleared and he was alert and oriented prior to discharge.  He
developed H Flu pneumonia and was started on Vancomycin,
cefepime and Cipro which was tapered down per the sensitivities.
 Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.

He developed compartment syndrome in the left lower extremity
several days postoperatively and was taken to the Operating Room
on [**3-15**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] for fasciotomy.  He has a pre-existent
left foot drop from his stroke and an AFO splint at home. which
he does not use. The patient was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the Physical Therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.

By the time of discharge on POD 10 the patient was ambulating
with a walker, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  Sutures from the fasciotomy
