History of Present Illness:
This is a 39 year-old female with a history of diabetes type I
on an insulin pump, anemia, hypothyroidism, gastroparesis, GERD,
who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for further management
of hypoxic respiratory failure.  She arrived at [**Hospital **] Hospital
on [**5-23**] for 1 day of nausea and vomiting and was found to be
febrile to 99 at that time.  She was admitted for likely
gastroparesis and eventually had a complete fever work-up that
included a negative chest x-ray, blood cultures, and urine
culture.  She was discharged on [**5-24**] and represented that day
with continued nause, vomiting, and fever.  She was readmitted
and had a complete febrile work-up that included CT
abdomene/pelvis, chest x-ray, blood culture's, urine cultures,
all of which were unremarkable.  She was intubated on [**5-25**] for
progressive respiratory failure.  Workup continued to be
negative.  Extubation was attempted on [**6-5**], but she was
re-intubated due to inspiratory stridor.  A CT neck showed soft
tissue swelling obliterating the airway surrounding the ETT
tube.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

1. Type I diabetes diagnosed at age 27.  She is usually managed
on an insulin pump.
2. Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Imaging:
1. Nexk CT: Increased soft tissues within the pharynx. This may
be secondary to soft tissue swelling as indicated in the
patient's history, and some may be secondary to secretions above
the ETT balloon. No retropharyngeal fluid is identified.
Dependent atelectasis is present within the visualized portions
of the lung apices.
2. Chest CT: Bilateral lower lobe consolidations mostly in
dependent portion, with small pleural effusion and diffuse
ground-glass opacity in bilateral upper and lower lobes,
consistent with ARDS with pulmonary edema given the history.
Ground-glass opacity is somewhat more prominent in right upper
lobe, and superimposed infection cannot be totally excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 39 year-old female with diabetes type I,
hypothyroidism, gastroparesis who was transfered for hypoxic
respiratory failure.
.
1. Hypoxic Rspiratory Failure: She arrived intubated and sedated
from [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital.  On arrival a chest x-ray showed perihilar
and bibasilar opacities, which appeared conistent with pulmonary
edema but also possibly consistent with a pneumonia.  There was
no evidence of ARDS.  She was known to have gram-positive cocci
in her sputum at the outside hospital.  A bronchoscopy with BAL
was performed and a sputum sample eventually grew out MRSA.  She
was treated with vancomycin to cover her MRSA pneumonia.
.
   A CT scan was performed on [**6-8**] to evaluate the soft tissue
swelling seen on CT at the outside hospital.  The CT showed
increased soft tissues within the pharynx which was felt to be
secondary to prolonged intubation/trauma.  She was treated with
steroids for this swelling at the outside hospital, and these
were continued.  It was decided that patient should receive one
more trial off the vent before committing her to a tracheotomy.
She did well on minimal vent settings but it was decided to
delay extubating the patient until the morning of [**6-10**].
Overnight, the patient became hypoxic, dropping to the 80's.  A
chest x-ray showed that the ET tube was displaced to very high
in the trachea.  The cuff was deflated and the patient was
extubated.  She was placed in supplemental oxygen by shovel mask
and her sats immediately improved.  She was weaned down until
she was maintaining her oxygen saturation above 90% on 6L by
nasal cannuala.  As she was doing well without evidence of
stridor, the steroids were stopped.  She did well and was weaned
from supplemental oxygen.  At the time of discharge, she was
oxygenating well on room air.  She Will need to complete a 14
day course of vancomycin for her MRSA pneumonia on [**2196-6-21**].
.
2. Enterobacter bacteremia: She was initially covered broadly
with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and falgyl.  She had positive
blood cultures at [**Hospital **] Hospital for gram negative rods.
Subsequently, zosyn was added.  The cultures grew out
enterobacter cloacae.  It was unclear the source of her
bacteremia.  Her stool cultures were negative.  Her central line
was removed and the tip was culture negative.  She was
transitioned to on levofloxacin for her bacteremia.  She had no
positive cultures during this admission.  Once she was more
stable, an abdominal CT was performed to look for an abscess.
This study was negative.  However, the study was limited due to
inadequate po contrast intake by the patient; it did show a
question of a cecal cystic lesion verse normal loop of bowel.
This study will need to be repeated once she is tolerating po's.
 She will complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin for her
bacteremia on [**2196-6-21**].
.
3. Diabetes type I: She was intially maintained on an insulin
drip for tight glycemic control.  She was followed by [**Last Name (un) **]
during the admission.  She was initially maintained on D5W,
which was increased to D10W as the patient was persistently
borderline hypoglycemic while on insulin drip.   Once she began
to take PO's, the insulin drip was stopped and patient was
started on glargine with a humalog sliding scale.  While her po
intake was minimal she was maintained on supplemental IV
dextrose to suppress ketosis.  While she was on the IV dextrose,
she required up to 26 units of glargine for glycemic control.
As she starting taking some foods, her glargine was decrease.
At the time of discharge her glargine was 10.  Her blood glucose
were under good control.  The day prior to discharge, she was
nauseated and not taking pos.  Therefore, she received 1L of D5,
and her sugars were elevated to 400 the day of discharge.
.
4. Gastroparesis: She has a history of gastroparesis secondary
to long-standing type I diabetes.  Once she was extubated, she
was nauseated with emesis.  She was intially treated with
erythromycin for pro-motility as she had a bad reaction to
reglan in the past.  She continued to remained nauseated so she
was treated with phenergan, anzemet, zofran, and ativan.  She
intermittently was able tolerate pos.  Her nausea was
accompanied by abdominal pain for which she was treated with
morphine.  She was transitioned to a PCA for better pain
control.  She continued to have nausea despite an agressive
anti-emetic regimen.
