Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
cuff leak

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy with Y stenting
repeat bronchoscopy [**5-29**]


History of Present Illness:
69F Hx COPD, CHF, lung Ca s/p RUL lobectomy, s/p trach brought
from [**Hospital1 **] (baintree) resp rehab for ? tracheal misplacement.
She was initially admitted to a community hospital in [**State 108**] in
[**2130**] for CHF. She improved and was transferred to [**Hospital1 7932**] (at family's request) for further rehabilitation care.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **], she was intubated for respiratory
distress. After 3 weeks of ventilation, she was admitted to [**Hospital 2586**] Medical Center for tracheostomy/PEG placement. She
did well post-operatively, and was transferred back to [**Hospital1 **]
for Vent weaning. Her initial tracheostomy was changed to a
Bavona on [**2-4**]. She did well until one week PTA, when she was
noted to have increased work of breathing and dyspnea. The MDs
at [**Hospital3 **] decided to change her tracheostomy tube for
a longer one. This was done at [**Hospital3 5365**] 4 days PTA.
Postoperatively, she had significant respiratory distress, did
not tolerate the vent, and was noted to have lower tidal
volumes, hypoxia with saturations to the low 90s, cyanosis and a
significant cuff leak. She was started on Ceftazidime at her
facility for ? PNA.She was thus transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation/intervention. En route, she was very anxious
and given 2mg IV ativan.

In the ER, she was noted initially to have slight perioral
cyanosis with RR 46. Her initial ABG was 7.39/59/70. She then
had an episode of significantly decreased tidal volumes. A
flexible bronch was done by Dr. [**Name (NI) **] in the ED, which
showed a posterior tracheal ulceration at the distal end of the
[**Last Name (un) **], with > 98% occlusion of the distal ostia of the tube by
the ulcer wall as well as granulation tissue. The bronchoscope
was passed through the obstruction, and the patient's O2
saturations, tidal volumes improved. She had two similar
episodes in the ED, which improved with upright positioning,
cough, and vocalizations. She had a persistent cuff leak. In th
ED, she also recieved Vanco 1g IV, Ceftazidime 2gm, Solumedrol
40mg IV and ativan 2mg IV.

.
CXR: Lung volumes are quite low. Tracheostomy tube has standard
appearance. Heart is normal size, shifted slightly to the right.
A dense band of radiopacity parallels the minor fissure, which
is either a fissural pleural fluid on the right or unusual
distribution of atelectasis. Just superior to that is an oval
region of consolidative lung with an appearance suggesting prior
radiation. It could explain right infrahilar consolidation and a
vertically oriented that to radiodensity projects lateral to the
upper descending thoracic aorta
.
Echo [**5-19**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function appears normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular systolic function appears normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve is not well seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
The main pulmonary artery is dilated. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**5-21**] CXR: 1. Improving pulmonary edema and bibasilar
atelectasis. Stable bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Continued right upper lobe opacity of uncertain etiology.
This could represent post-radiation change, superimposed
infection, or possibly active tumor in this area. The finding
was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7933**], who indicates a history
of prior upper lobectomy of uncertain laterality that is
followed in an outside hospital. Clinical correlation is
necessary.
.
ECHO [**5-29**]: normal LVEF, severe [**2-2**] diastolic dysfunction.
.
[**5-27**] blood cultures: + for seratia marscens (sensitive to
zosyn).
[**5-29**] bronch sputum gram stain: +GNR.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo F with history of COPD, CHF, chronic trach originally
presented with increased respiratory distress, cyanosis,
hypoxia.
.
HYPOTENSION/SEPSIS:
Pt has been intermittently hypotensive s/p aggressive diuresis
over the course of her admissing to the MICU.  These episodes
have typically resolved with IVF boluses.  On [**5-28**] she developed
respiratory distress felt [**1-3**] aspiration of liquids, and
developed hypotension requiring pressor support (levo/vaso,
changed to neo/vaso).  In addition to her underlying
intravascular depletion, a septic and cardiogenic etiology were
considered.  Cardiac enzymes were found to be elevated, and
NSTEMI was diagnosed.  Troponins peaked at 0.19, and trended
downward.  A repeat ECHO showed no change in LVEF, and severe
diastolic dysfunction.  Pt was not felt to be a candidate for
angioplasty or beta blockers [**1-3**] her hypotension, but was
treated with aspirin.   Blood Cultures from [**5-27**] showed GNR
(serratia marscens), and sputum gram stain also showed GNR.  Pt
was begun on a course of zosyn ([**5-28**]) and levaquin ([**5-30**]).  The
patient was persistently hypotesive even after resolution of
sepsis.  The patient was switched from prednisone (for COPD) to
dexamethasone in order to perform an accurate [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test. As
above, pt was started on a dopamine drip for hypotension during
diuresis. However, even after the lasix drip was discontinued,
pt remained hypotensive and required dopamine. The decision was
made to [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim the patient but
