DIAGNOSIS: Colostomy: Consistent with colostomy.

[**2150-6-23**] EKG:
Sinus tachycardia. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2150-6-19**] the rate has increased and there are
new ST-T wave changes with T wave inversion in leads I, aVL and
V5-V6. The QRS complex has widened. Rule out active ischemic
process.

[**2150-6-24**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2150-6-23**] the rate has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim
change.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
elective ventral hernia repair and colostomy takedown on
[**2150-6-21**]. Patient on Coumadin at home for DVT/PE treatment, INR
on admission was 4.0. Patient was given vitamin K, and started
on Heparin gtt for bridging therapy. Cardiology was consulted
for pre-op clearance, and patient was cleared for surgery from
cardiology stand point.  On [**2150-6-22**], the patient underwent
colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair, which went well
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). After surgery patient was extubated in the PACU, he
was noticed to have sinus tachycardia, and secondary to his
cardiac history, patient was transferred in ICU foe observation.
Patient was NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with Foley
catheter and Dilaudid PCA for pain control. The patient was
hemodynamically stable.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.
CV: Patient with a history of CAD s/p CABG and chronic left
bundle-branch block, after surgery was found to have sinus
tachycardia. Patient was transferred into ICU where he converted
in regular rhythm with fluid resuscitation. Cardiac enzymes were
checked and were negative x 2. Patient was transferred on the
floor for continue treatment and observation. He remained stable
from cardiac stand point.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. On discharge,
patient tolerates regular diet and had several BM.
ID: Intraoperatively 5 JP drains were placed and patient was
started on empirical treatment with IV Abx. After JP drains were
removed  all antibiotics were discontinued, patient remained
afebrile during hospitalization, WBC was routinely monitored and
on dischared was 9.0.
Wound care: staples will be removed during follow up appointment
with Plastic surgery. Keep wound open to air, patient can
shower.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.
DVT/PE Prophylaxis and Treatment: Patient was started on Heparin
gtt after operation and his PTT was kept between 60-80. When
tolerated PO, patient was started on PO Coumadin. PTT/INR was
checked periodically, and Heparin gtt/Coumadin PO was adjusted
according to results. Prior discharge INR was sub therapeutic
(1.5), patient was discharged in Acute Care Rehab on continuous
Heparin gtt.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with
the discharge plan.
