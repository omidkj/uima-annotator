MICROBIOLOGY:

[**2141-4-29**] Abscess aspirate: E. coli (pan-sensitive)

RADIOLOGY:

[**2141-4-28**] CT: There are no stones in the ureters or  urinary
bladder. The prostate and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable.
There is a 7.3 x 5.4 cm fluid collection inferior to the cecum,
with adjacent fat stranding. The appendix is not visualized.
These findings likely represent ruptured appendicitis and
periappendiceal abscess. Small bowel loops are normal in
caliber.

[**2141-4-29**] CT: Successful placement of an 8-French self-locking
pigtail catheter within the periappendiceal abscess. The
catheter is open to drainage.

[**2141-5-6**] CT: drainage from JP


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58 year old male who was admitted on [**2141-4-28**] with
several weeks of abdominal pain and a CT scan revealing an
appendiceal abscess. This was drained by interventional
radiology on [**2141-4-29**] and an 8-french catheter was left in place.
The patient was toxic-appearing on admission with tachycardia
and low oxygen saturation. He also had an INR of 10 and was on
coumadin at home for peripheral vascular disease, but hadn't had
this checked regularly. He also had an elevated blood sugar of
500. He was admitted to the intensive care unit for management
of these multiple issues . His pain was well controlled with prn
morphine. From a respiratory standpoint, he was well-managed
with nasal cannula oxygen and did not require intubation but was
treated with nebulizers.  His blood sugars were managed
initially with an insulin drip which was then converted to
sliding scale insulin. He was started on empiric levoquin and
flagyl. Prior to the IR drainage, FFP was used to reverse his
elevated INR. He remained stable after his procedure and had no
bleeding complications. On hospital day three he was started
back on a clear diet which he tolerated well. He received lasix
diuresis for congestion in his lungs and edema with good
response. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for diabetes control and assisted
with transition to a sliding scale insulin. He was transfered to
the floor on hospital day 5 and started on a regular diet which
he tolerated well . His hematocrit trended downward although
there was no evidence of an active bleed and he was supported
with 2 units of packed red blood prodcuts on hospital day 5.
Pulmonology consult was obtained and assessed the patient as
having chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and felt he should
continue his home oxygen treatment and transition from
nebulizers here to combivent at home. He was restarted on his
home coumadin on hospital
