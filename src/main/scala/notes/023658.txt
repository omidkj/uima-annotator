Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission he was begun on Heparin and cCoumadin
discontinued.  Dental clearance was necessary as were several
extractions prior to his cardiac procedure.  After the
extractions he remaianed stable.  On [**2-17**] he was taken to
the Operating Room where MAZE, a Bental procedure with a 27mm
Freestyle root valve and ligation of the left atrial appendage
were performed.  He tolerated the operation well and was taken
to the ICU on Neo Synephrine and Propofol infusions in stable
condition.  He awoke intact, was weaned from the ventilator and
pressors without problems.

He was transferred to the floor, where Physical Therapy worked
with him for strength and mobility.  Coumadin was resumed for
atrial fibrillation, which persisted after surgery.  CTs and
tempraory pacing wires were removed according to protocols.

He was ambulatory, wounds were clean and healing well after
surgery.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4553**] will continue to follow his Coumadin
after discharge (hospital INRs and Coumadin doses were faxed)
and the target INR is [**12-24**].  He is to take Coumadin 7.5mg [**2-21**] and
5mg [**2-23**].

Arrangements were made for follow up, medicatins were discussed
as well.
