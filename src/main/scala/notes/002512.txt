Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for multiple issues


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
C1-2 posterior decompression, evacuation abcess
Ventriculostomy placement


History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with PMHx of asthma who presented to OSH for confusion
and bizzare behavior, found to have fevers, neck stiffness,
abnormal LP, MSSA bacteremia with hospital course c/b aspiration
event and intubation and acute hemiparesis episode concerning
for CVA now transferred for ongoing management for medical
issues.
.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 10310**] on [**4-12**] after friends
found him confused in his home after not showing up to work for
2 days. Friends report he was confused with slurred speech,
unsteady on feet, and letting something burn on his oven. Per
report of brother, pt had visited PCP twice in prior 10 days for
neck pain and apparently co-workers and reported he was feeling
less well, complaining of neck pain, and perhaps acting more
confused or unusual than normal. PCP is reported to have treated
neck pain with flexeril, benzos, and vicodin. When arrived at
[**Hospital3 10310**] on [**4-12**], temp was 101.2 and pt was confused.
Zosyn was started emperically but on HD #2 pt appeared worse and
LP was done showing high protein, low glucose, with elevated WBC
of PMN predominance but gram-stain showed no organisms and CSF
Cx was still negative at time of transfer. Gram-stain from Bcx
on admission grew GPCs and Vancomycin started -> cultures
ultimately grew 4/4 bottles MSSA on [**4-14**] and ID saw pt in consult
and started cefazolin to which the MSSA was sensative. Later on
HD #3 ([**4-14**]), he had an aspiration event that required intubation
and transfer to MICU although hemodynamically stable at time. Pt
was placed back on Vancomycin and started on Cefepime (unclear
but zosyn possibly stopped somewhere in this interval). Highest
temp of hospitalization was also on this day to 104.0 in AM [**4-14**].
On intubation and ICU transfer, pt given propofol with resulting
BP drop and was started on dopaminem with RIJ CVL placed. He
underwent TTE which showed small hyperechoic 3mm lesion in RV
trabeculations and 1.5 cm isoechoic RV apical septum lesion.
Neither were thought suggestive of a vegetation/endocarditis and
no left-sided valvular lesions were noted. He was also noted to
have infiltrate on CXRs during admission and sputum Cx from [**4-14**]
grew MSSA. He was maintained on [**Month/Day (4) 621**] but failed extubation on [**4-17**]
with immediate reintubation. [**Month/Day (4) **] changed to Vanc/Meropenem on
[**4-17**] but continued to spike fevers. On early Tues ([**4-18**]) he
developed right arm weakness and a CT head was noted to have new
right cerebellar infarcts (one hypodense lesion in pons and one
large non-hemorrhagic R cerebellar infacrtion with partial
effacement of 4th ventricle). No hemorrhage or midline shift.
Hard to oxygenate since requiring Fi02 of 100% and Peep of 12 to
maintain sats in the 80s. Receiving SQH only for DVT ppx.
.
Brother [**Name (NI) **] speaks to pt every few weeks. Confirms that pt is
somewhat of a recluse but reports that he volunteers some at a
senior center. Confirms that sent co-workers of pt to find him
on [**4-12**] due to pt seeming confused via phone and due to reports
that pt was confused at the senior center where he volunteered.
for neck pain but brother did not recognize torticollus. Brother
mentioned that two weeks prior pt had reported a rash on his
body but did not give further discription. Pt also says that he
did not recognize the name torticollus in reference to his
brother's neck problem.
.
In the ICU, pt minimally responsive to some questions and
commands but unable to speak due to endotracheal tube so further
information could not be elicited.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year-old M with high grade MSSA bactermia, MSSA positive
sputume with CXR concerning for infiltrate, LP concerning for
bacterial meningitis, and new posterior circulation cerebellar
infarcts with background story and diagnostics unclear as to
where is initial location of infection.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Seems to have been triggered by
aspiration event on [**4-14**] per OSH records. CXR showing bilateral
lung field opacifications most pronounced at bases concerning
for consolidation plus pleural effusions. In setting of MSSA in
sputum, likely has staph aureus PNA as this is rarely a
contaminant/colinizer although likely that this bug seeded from
another source or from bacteremia. Had reported difficulties
ventilating at OSH, but gas on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] on 100% FiO2 and
PEEP 12 was pH 7.43 pCO2 41 pO2 285 HCO3 28 and pt tolerated
initial wean to PEEP 10 and FiO2 50% with sats in high 90s. Pt
has history of
