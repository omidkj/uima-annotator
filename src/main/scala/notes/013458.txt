HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 77-year-old man
with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2122-7-14**], who presented to the Emergency Department on the
night of [**9-13**] complaining of a three day history of
chest pain and worsening shortness of breath.  He also
reported increasing oxygen requirement at home.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2122-7-14**] status
post [**1-17**] cycles of Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **].  His last treatment 2.5 weeks
prior to admission, on home oxygen.
2. Seizure disorder.
3. Status post right hemicolectomy for a benign tumor in '[**18**].
4. IHSS.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  After the cardiac
catheterization (see below), it was determined by enzymes
that the patient sustained an acute myocardial infarction,
however, he remained hemodynamically stable throughout his
hospital stay.  The patient was initially admitted to the CCU
after his complaints of chest pain, worsening shortness of
breath, and an EKG revealing sinus tachycardia with a right
bundle branch block pattern, right axis deviation, and ST
depressions in the inferolateral leads.  It was suspected
that patient had cardiac tamponade.  He was taken to the
catheterization laboratory and right heart catheterization
revealed no effusion, normal right heart pressures.

On his first day of admission, he dropped his hematocrit from
35 to 17 and his stool was guaiac positive.  He was
transferred from the CCU to the MICU after he was intubated
secondary to hypoxia.

Patient was in the ICU for approximately two weeks at which
point there were daily attempts made to wean patient from the
ventilator.  However, he continued to have an increased
oxygen requirement likely secondary to worsening metastatic
lung cancer as well as what was identified to be pneumonia
from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Unfortunately, instead of clinically improve despite multiple
attempts at weaning from the vent while on the appropriate IV
antibiotics for his infection, these attempts were
unsuccessful.  After multiple family meetings, it was
determined that the patient would not like to go on like
this, and the decision was made on [**9-28**] to
discontinue the ventilator and extubate the patient.  He
passed away a few hours after this was done.

In terms of his GI bleed after one or two blood transfusions,
hematocrit stabilized, and the decision was made for no
intervention.

CAUSE OF DEATH:  Metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer leading
to respiratory failure.
