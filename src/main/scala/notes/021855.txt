Brief Hospital Course:
60 y/o F with prior alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease (no
known cirrhosis), DM II on insulin, depression, who presents
from OSH after excessive post-biopsy bleeding after EGD, concern
for biopsy of an occult gastric varix.

#  UGI Bleed:  Patient had bx of gasric mass that was possibly a
gastric varix. After transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she was hemodynamically
stable on transfer to the MICU. HCT was trended Q6H and remained
stable at between 24-28.. She was kept NPO overnight initially,
and advanced to clears the following morning. She was then
called out to the floor team. She tolerated a regular diet well.
Serial HCTs were stable. She was maintained on ciprofloxacin
500mg [**Hospital1 **] for empiric post-variceal bleeding prophylaxis, even
though there was no good evidence of this. She was discharged on
a total of 5 days of ciprofloxacin, as well as a twice daily
PPI, and instructions to followup with her gastroenterologist.
.
# ? Cirrhosis:  Patient has a long history of alcoholism and had
a prior liver bx showing chronic hepatitis, inflammation grade
[**1-17**], fibrosis grade II-III.  Patient states that she has no h/o
cirrhosis, and has abstained from alcohol for the past 3 years.
LFTs and liver synthetic markers were within normal limits. She
was instructed on the importance of following up with her
outpatient GI Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 86659**] in [**Location (un) 5028**], as she will need
further r/o cirrhosis workup inlcluding liver imaging, repeat
endoscopy, hepatitis serologies, iron studies, and consideration
of nadolol or other non-selective beta blocker if in fact
varices are demonstrated.

# Chronic Back Pain:  Continued on home tramadol.
