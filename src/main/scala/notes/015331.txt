History of Present Illness:
A 69 year-old woman with history of moderate AS, enterocutaneous
fistula on TPN and complicated PMH who presents from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab after an accidental overdose w/ 40 mg crushed oxycontin
instead of 20 mg IR oxycodone. She was given the oxycontin today
and was noted to be obtunded w/ bradycardia and hypoxia so was
given narcan. After the narcan was given, she became acutely
tachycardic and hypertensive to 220/120 with associated dypnea.
An ABG done at the time demonstrated 7.24/53/95.

Per OSH records, she has also been having high-spiking fevers to
104 over the past couple of days w/ GNR in urine and blood and
had been treated with imipenem since day prior to admission.

190/100 22 100 on NRB (82% on RA). EKG with sinus tach. Received
albuterol, combivent nebs, meropenem 500 mg IV, tylenol 650 pr.
CXR with ? multifocal PNA. 92/45, 100% on neb mask, HR 120. Has
only received 650 cc NS. Guaiac +.

On arrival to the ICU, she states she was afraid she was going
to die this afternoon. She endorses persistent mild dyspnea and
anxiety. She has chronic bilateral hip pain that has been
attributed to osteoarthritis. She endorses dysuria and fevers X
1 week. She thinks she has been coughing up thick mucus X 1 day.

[**6-22**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
3. Vague opacity at the right lung base which may represent a
focus of
scarring, though given the lack of prior studies to assess
stability, a CT is recommended to further assess.
2. Prominence of bronchovasculature may be related to chronic
lung disease
though mild congestion may also be considered.

[**6-23**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area likely <1.0cm2 given peak
gradient >60mmHg). No definite aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve could not be adequated assessed. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is no
definite pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with preserved global
systolic function.

[**6-23**] LE U/S
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the lower extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 69 year-old woman with history of moderate AS (now severe on
most recent TTE), HTN, COPD, entero-cutaneous fistula after
abdominal surgery on TPN, h/o multiple infections presents from
rehab with hypoxia and hypotension after accidental overdose of
oxycodone.

# Sepsis: Blood cultures grew out pan-sensitive E coli. She had
been treated for a UTI at rehab with imipenem x1 day prior to
admission. She was started on Zosyn but this was switched over
to intravenous ciprofloxacin when cultures and sensitivities had
returned. The presumed source for the bacteremia is urinary,
although GI source must also be considered given her complicated
surgical history and enterocutaneous fistula. Her PICC line was
removed and a temporary central venous line was placed. Prior to
discharge, another PICC has been placed and the left subclavian
CVL removed. She can continue to receive TPN through this PICC
line. Her antibiotics have been switched to PO ciprofloxacin.
She will comple
