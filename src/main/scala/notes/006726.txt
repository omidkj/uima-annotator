Brief Hospital Course:
Plan:
1. Resp/PNA- Currently on Zosyn/Cipro day 13/21 for pseudomonas
in sputum. Completed course of bactrim for stenotrophomonas.
Remains afebrile. Persistent R diffuse opacities in RUL/RLL.
Continues to be vent dependent on AC. Previous attempts at
weaning to PS resulted in hypercapnia, breath stacking.
-Continue Zosyn/Cipro for 21 day course
-Continue AC; PS trials as tolerated
2. Hypotension- Likely cardiogenic in etiology w/ depressed EF
10-15%. BP controlled w/ pressor support on levaphed. The goal
is to wean down the levaphed while maintaining MAPs >50. Will
continue to wean as tolerated. On [**8-23**]-->transfused w/ 2U PRBC's
to drive up HCT and help maintain intravascular volume, but
still unable to wean. Distributive etiology less likely given
Negative Blood Cx's to date and appropriate Cortisol response.
-[**8-26**] placed ABG to help better assess BP's and titrate Pressors

-Cont. Levophed, wean as tolerated to maintain MAP's >50
3. GI: Started on erythromycin to increase GI motility.
Tolerating tube feeds w/ goal of 35 cc/hr. No BRB per PEG. HCT
stable. Avoid opioid analgesics. Supplement electrolytes prn.
[**8-17**]-KUB and CT negative for obstruction. CT shows no dilated
bowel or thickened bowel wall.
4.CHF- EF 15%, avoid excess fluid; pressor support as necessary.

5.MVR/Afib- Coumadin increased to 3mg qhs for goal INR of
2.5-3.5. Once INR therapeutic, we can D/C heparin. Heparin
currently therapeutic at 60-80 pTT.
6. ESRD- ESRD requiring HD. Brief trial of CVVH on this
admission to help reduce a 20+ liter volume overload, but did
not tolerate well (increased need for pressor support following
tx). Currently on Tu/Th/Sa intermittent HD schedule. Tolerating
well and maintains MAP's >60 through tx. +19 L for length of
stay. HD has removed between 1-4L per tx. Followed by renal qd.
Electrolytes (Chem 10) qd.
7. Pain- Vioxx for back pain (h/o ankylosing spondylitis).
Haldol or gentle ativan (0.25) for agitation/anxiety. Avoid
opioid analgesics [**2-26**] decreased gut motility. Avoid Ambien [**2-26**]
mental status changes.
8. FEN- Tube feeds per nutrition recs, with goal of 35 cc/hr.
TPN d/c'd.
9. Access- R. PICC; L. dialysis cath
10. Comm - daily with family
11. Code Status: DNR- Shock treatable rythms, but no
compressions. Continue Ventilatory and Pressor Support. Lines
ok. Only change from previous Full Code Status is that we will
not do compressions

[**8-31**] pt had periods of continued desaturation and multiple
brochoscopies reveal mucus plugging as well as clot.  Eventually
the patient was unable to oxygenate adequately and passed away
from respiratory failure.
