Admission Date:  [**2181-5-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2181-6-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2117-5-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64 year-old female
patient with a history of tobacco abuse, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, prior cerebrovascular accident times two and
chronic renal insufficiency.  She has had a distant right
nephrectomy after traumatic injury in [**2147**].  She presented to
an outside hospital on the [**7-18**] with progressive
shortness of breath.  She was initially treated for an
exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Her course was notable, however, for an elevation in her
creatinine, which runs at baseline in the 3 to 3.5 range to
as high as 5.  She was seen by a nephrologist there and her
shortness of breath was determined to be of possible cardiac
origin and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2181-5-30**] for cardiac catheterization
after having undergone a stress test, which was markedly
positive.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, cerebrovascular accident times two in
[**2165**] and [**2174**], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
renal insufficiency.  She is status post a right nephrectomy.
She has had an echocardiogram in the past, which has revealed
an ejection fraction of approximately 40%.  She has
osteoporosis.  The patient also has bilateral proximal ICA
stenosis and chronic renal insufficiency.  She is status post
tubal ligation, status post tonsillectomy.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Coumadin, Zocor, Diltiazem, Raloxifene.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL TO [**Hospital1 **]:  Regular insulin sliding scale,
Evista, Miacalcin nasal spray, Protonix 40 mg po q day,
Cardia 240 mg q day, Cardia 240 mg q day, Plavix 75 mg q.d.,
Lipitor 10 mg q.d., Prednisone 20 mg q.d., Isordil 20 mg
t.i.d., Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states she has no known drug
allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed with nine children.  She is a
current smoker approximately 55 pack years.  She drinks two
alcoholic beverages per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION TO THE HOSPITAL:  Unremarkable with
stable vital signs.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  Sodium 139,
potassium 4.5, chloride 107, CO2 19, BUN 69, creatinine 3.8,
glucose 78, white blood cell count 12.6, hematocrit 32.0,
platelet count 214,000.  Her echocardiogram revealed mild
global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 40%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Renal medicine consult was obtained on the
day of admission due to her chronic renal insufficiency with
elevated creatinine.  The renal medicine as well as
cardiology medicine service has continued to follow her over
the next few days in the hospital.  On [**2181-6-6**] the
patient underwent a carotid ultrasound, which showed a
significant hemodynamic lesion in the left internal carotid
artery with narrowing of approximately 60 to 70% with mild
plaque and the right ICA with narrowing of less then 40%.  A
cardiothoracic surgery consult was obtained on [**2181-6-4**]
after cardiac catheterization demonstrated significant three
vessel coronary artery disease.  On [**2181-6-6**] Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] from cardiothoracic surgery was consulted.  It was
his recommendation to stop the Plavix at that time in
preparation for anticipated coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.  Pulmonary medicine consult was obtained on [**6-7**].
It was their recommendation to initiate bronchodilators, but
the patient refused that at that time.

The patient was ultimately taken to the Operating Room on
[**2181-6-11**] where she underwent coronary artery bypass
graft times three with a left internal mammary coronary
artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery,
saphenous vein to the obtuse marginal and a saphenous vein to
the posterior descending coronary artery by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].  Postoperatively, the patient was transported from
the Operating Room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on
Milrinone and nitroglycerin intravenous drips.  Ultimately
Nipride and nitroglycerin intravenous drips were started on
the day of surgery due to the continued hypertension.  The
patient was placed on stress dose hydrocortisone due to her
chronic Prednisone usage for her chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  Postoperative day one the patient was
weaned from mechanical ventilator and extubated.  The patient
remained on nitroglycerin for continued hypertension.  On
postoperative day two was transitioned to oral
antihypertensive medications and on postoperative day three
remained on a small dose of intravenous nitroglycerin drip.
She was reinitiated on her Plavix due to her carotid artery
disease and was transferred to the surgical Intensive Care
Unit.  A critical care consultation was obtained at that
time.  The patient remained extubated and was ultimately
transferred to the telemetry floor the following day [**6-15**],
postoperative day four.

The patient's epicardial pacing wires were discontinued.  Her
beta blockers were increased.  She was begun on cardiac
rehabilitation and physical therapy.  The patient continued
to progress well, although she was slow to wean off
supplemental oxygen due to some hypoxia.  Her creatinine had
risen up as high as 4.5 in the postoperative period, but has
subsequently come down to 3.6.  On [**6-16**], the patient was
noted to have significant hematuria.  She was being
maintained on aspirin and Plavix due to her peripheral
vascular disease and coronary artery disease and on the [**6-17**] postoperative day six a urology consultation was
obtained.  It was their recommendation to continue the
aspirin and the Plavix and to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9125**]
as an outpatient for possible cystoscopy and CT scan or an
MRI.  His telephone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6445**].  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable over the next few days and
required increasing of her oral antihypertensive medications
and today on postoperative day eight is stable and ready to
be discharged home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature 95.5.  Pulse 62.  Blood
pressure 138/62.  Respirations 20.  Her weight today is 53.4

neurologically the patient is grossly intact.  Pulmonary
examination her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Coronary rate, regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is benign.
Her chest and leg incisions are clean, dry and intact.

day, Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg po q day, Norvasc
10 mg po q day, Clonidine 0.1 mg po t.i.d., Lopressor 75 mg
po t.i.d., Hydralazine 10 mg po t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg po q day,
Prednisone 20 mg po q day, Evista 60 mg po q day, Miacalcin
nasal spray one spray q.d., Plavix 75 mg po q day,
Levofloxacin 250 mg po q day times five more days for a
positive urinalysis, which was obtained on [**2181-6-17**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  The patient is to follow up
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] Cardiothoracic Surgery Service at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**] in approximately one month.  She is to follow up
with her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] in one to two weeks
for continued assessment and treatment of her ongoing
hypertension.  She is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9125**]
Urology Service at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6445**] in two to four weeks as an
outpatient for continued assessment and treatment of her
postoperative hematuria.  She is to also follow up with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 805**] Nephrology Service due to her chronic renal
insufficiency.  His office number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3637**] and she is
to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] in two to four weeks after
discharge.
