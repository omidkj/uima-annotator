HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 48035**] is a transfer from
[**Hospital1 1474**] with respiratory distress.  Ms. [**Known lastname 48035**] is a
63-year-old woman with history of heavy tobacco and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, question of asthma diagnosed
one year ago who was in her usual state of health until late
[**2157-2-12**] when she presented with back pain and nasal
congestion.  Her initial chest x-ray showed a right lower
lobe infiltrate.  She was treated with pneumonia with an
antibiotic course.  She subsequently had continued
respiratory and back symptoms and was treated with several
other antibiotic courses without any improvement.  Follow-up
chest x-rays revealed increased infiltrates in the right
upper lobe and posterior right hilum.  She went on to have a
chest CT which showed a 2 cm pleural-based mass and hilar and
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and diagnosis of bronchogenic
carcinoma was entertained.  She then underwent a bronchoscopy
which revealed no endobronchial lesions and a nondiagnostic
biopsy.  She then underwent CT guided needle biopsy of the
right middle lobe which again was nondiagnostic.  Over the
next several months she continued to have decline in her
respiratory symptoms, was again given several antibiotic
courses without effect and then presented to an outside
hospital on [**2157-5-13**], with increasing temperatures to
102.5 degrees, elevated white count and severe shortness of
breath.  Her initial chest x-ray revealed a large right-sided
density with effusion.  At the outside hospital she was
treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, was admitted.  She
continued to have worsening respiratory distress and was
transferred to the ICU there.  Repeat CT scan revealed
extensive right-sided infiltrates and a new left upper lobe
infiltrate.  At that time she had a blood gas of 97/19/86/98
and was intubated for both hypercarbic and hypoxic
respiratory failure.  Later in that course she was bronch'd
and repeat bronchoscopy revealed thick secretions but no
lesions.  Biopsy again was done which was negative.  She
continued to have temperature spikes and it was decided for
her to go to VATS.  At VATS, however, she had thick adhesive
pleuritis and, therefore, the procedure was converted to open
lung biopsy.  It was a right mini thoracotomy with wedge
biopsy which initial frozen section revealed organizing
pneumonia.  Due to patient's worsening oxygenation and higher
oxygen requirements, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.  Of
note, the patient had a right chest tube that was placed at
the time of mini thoracotomy and had a subclavian and radial
A-line placed as well at the time of her procedure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Her temperature was 101.9
degrees, heart rate 100-120, blood pressure 80-100/40-50.
Settings:  She was on AC at 800 x 14, FiO2 80%, PEEP of 10,
PIP 33, __ of 30 and her blood gas was 7.38/49/67.  In
general, she was intubated, sedated but opened her eyes to
voice.  Pupils were reactive.  She had an endotracheal tube
in place.  She had diffuse coarse rales bilaterally, right
greater than left.  Right subclavian line intact.  Cardiac
regular.  Abdomen benign.  Extremities:  She had [**12-16**]+ pedal
edema.  Left radial A-line intact.  Neuro:  She was sedated.
Skin:  She had a bullous [**Last Name (un) **]-sized lesion on the dorsum of
her right foot with surrounding erythema.

LABORATORY:  Initial white count was 17.5 which was showing
81 polys, 4 bands and 12% eosinophils.  H&H:  9.3/28.
Platelet count 465,000.  Seven within normal limits.  ALT,
AST normal.  Alk phos 430.  Total bilirubin 1.4.  LDH 191,
INR 1.5, PT 15.2, PTT 30.0.

RADIOLOGY:  Initial chest x-ray here revealed a right lower
and middle lobe infiltrate and a left lower lobe opacity.
She had a right chest tube in place.  No evidence of
pneumothorax.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Initial EKG was sinus tachycardia at 118.
No acute changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient initially admitted
with bilateral pulmonary processes unresponsive to
antibiotics and eventually undergone VATS at an outside
hospital with a diagnosis consistent with organizing
pneumonia.  A question of BOOP was entertained given that
patient had a process that was not responsive to traditional
antibiotics.  The diagnosis of atypical infection,
vasculitis, sarcoid, tuberculosis and ARDS was entertained.
Patient had a workup including a sed rate, [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA and
rheumatoid factor.  In addition, multiple serologies were
sent including AFB.  Patient's sed rate came back at 11.
Decision was made to empirically start the patient on high
dose steroids.  The patient was started on Solu-Medrol 125
times one and then 80 IV t.i.d.  The patient was also
continued on antibiotics for several days.  All culture data
came back negative initially.  Patient's sed rate came back
at 130.  Patient had a positive [**Doctor First Name **] initially at 1:40.
Patient's rheumatoid factor also had a low positive factor.
Patient continued to improve on intravenous steroids and
several days into her course, patient's C-ANCA came back
positive which is consistent with a vasculitis.  Then Cytoxan
150 mg p.o. q. day was added to her regimen of high dose
steroids.  Again, over the course of several days the
patient's FiO2 requirement was able to be weaned to 40%,
after several days, approximately hospital day ten.  On [**5-28**], hospital day 10, patient was successfully extubated after
a prolonged course on the vent and patient maintained off the
vent.  Again, Rheumatology was asked to follow the patient
given the ANCA even as the initial peripheral eosinophilia
history of asthma and now bilateral infiltrates, the question
of [**Last Name (un) 48036**]-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**] syndrome versus Wegener's granulomatosis was
entertained.  On further history, patient gave a history of
right lower extremity neuropathy and further studies were
done including nerve conduction and EMG which revealed a
mononeuritis multiplex.  The patient then went on to a
sterile nerve biopsy which again revealed a small vessel
vasculitis confirming a diagnosis of either [**Last Name (un) 48036**]-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**] or
Wegener's.  The patient's steroids were eventually tapered
after several days from 80 IV t.i.d. down to prednisone 80 q.
day and finally down to 60 q. day and patient will be
discharged on a prolonged course of Cytoxan 150 q. day and
prednisone 60 q. day.  After patient was extubated for
several days she was eventually transferred to the floor off
all antibiotics, however, several days into her stay on the
floor patient had transient desaturations.  Upon discharge
from the ICU patient's saturations were 93-96% on five
liters, however, on the floor patient had desaturations to
the mid 80's requiring temporary nonrebreather with
suctioning and chest PT.  Patient was able to cough up
several blood tinged mucus plugs.  Patient also had an
elevation in her white count up to 13-20 during these
episodes and, due to subsequent desaturations, she was
transferred back to the ICU where she was pan cultured and
appar
