Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Sudden onset of left-sided weakness and lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] is a 55 year old with hx of CAD, CHF (EF 15% with
apical thrombus), h/o severe MR s/p St. Jude valve [**2123**] (on
Coumadin), HTN, DM, high cholesterol, who presented on [**10-28**]
with one day of left sided weakness and lightheadedness.
*
On the day prior to admission, he started to feel dizzy while
sitting down watching television. He tried to get up to go to
the bathroom. At that time, he noted left arm and leg weakness.
He had difficulty walking, but was able to take a shower. His
left side also felt numb. His wife and son helped him get ready
for bed. He went to sleep and woke up on the day of admission
with left-sided weakness. He then decided to come the ER.
*
In the ER, he was found to have BP 157/83 HR 73 RR18 O2Sat 99%.
Exam was significant for inattention to left side, righ gaze
deviation, right eye skew deviation, vertical upgaze palsy, left
hemiparesis, left hemisensory loss. CT Scan showed 4cm x 3cm
right basal ganglia/thalamic bleed with extension to right
lateral ventricle with mass effect and slight midline shift.
There was also extension inferiorly into the midbrain. His INR
was found to be 2.7. He was given 2400U Factor VII and 2U FFP to
reverse coagulopathy. He was also given Vit K 10mg SC. He was
started on a labetalol drip to keep MAP less than 100. He was
admitted to the NICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo male with h/o HTN, St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mitral valve, ischemic
cadiomyopathy, DM, high cholesterol, CAD with right thalamic
bleed in context of anticoagulation with coumadin. His exam is
significant for left sided inattention, upgaze palsy, bilateral
sixth nerve palsy, skew deviation of right eye, left hemiplegia,
and left hemisensory loss. All of these findings are c/w right
thalamic bleed, and the bilateral 6th nerve palsy may be
explained by intracranial hypertension.
*
1. Neuro: ICH likely due to HTN complicated by anticoagulation
(INR 2.7).
- While in the ICU, the patient was started on Mannitol 25mg IV
q4h, which was d/c'ed on [**10-31**] on transfer to the floor.
- The patient was first on a nicardipine drip and then on a
labetalol drip for BP control, for target MAP < 110 and goal SBP
< 140. BPs remained fairly well controlled on drip, but he had
episodes of agitation where BP was increased to 190's. On [**10-31**],
he was transitioned to po metoprolol (as below).
- Repeat head CTs on [**10-29**] and [**10-30**] showed stable appearance of
the bleed.
- The patient's exam remained unchanged during his
hospitalization.
*
2. Cardiac:
- HTN - On [**2125-10-22**], metoprolol was increased to 75mg tid and
home losartan (50mg qd) restarted. Pt was continued on home dose
hydralazine (50mg [**Hospital1 **]).
- AICD in place
*
3. Heme: A/C reversed with Vit K, FFP and factor 7 in ER.
- Coumadin was d/c'ed, and the patient's goal INR was 1-1.5
throughout his hospital stay.
- Baby aspirin [**Name2 (NI) **] was started on [**2125-11-1**].
.
**** The decision was made that the patient should be restarted
on coumadin on [**2125-11-4**] (one week from the date of his event),
and that he should be started with low dose and advanced slowly.
Given the risk of bleed, it was felt that his goal INR should be
2.5-3. The risks and benefits of coumadin in the setting of
hemorrhagic stroke were discussed with the patient, his family,
and the patient's cardiologist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
*
4. Endo: DM
- Patient had been on sliding scale in NICU, and on transfer to
the floor on [**2125-10-21**] was placed on standing NPH as well as
humalog sliding scale. NPH doses were increased daily.
*
5. Pulm:
- The pt had a low grade temp on [**10-30**] and CXR was obtained to
r/o PNA. CXR was normal, but left lung base was not adequately
visualized. A PA and lateral showed no infiltrate. Sats were
good and pt did not have T spike.
*
6. F/E/N:
- Diabetic, cardiac diet
- Pt coughed during neuro exam with thin liquids. Videoswallow
showed that the patient had no difficulty with thin liquids, but
did have difficulty with mixed consistency liquids.
Recommendations were: 1. Thin liquids, soft solids. 2. Meds
whole in puree. 3. NO MIXED CONSISTENCIES (i.e., cold ceral with
milk, soup,
most fruit- bananas are okay). 4. No straws. Please encourage pt
to take single sips of liquid from the cup, versus continuous
"chug a lug" drinking.
*
7. Renal:
- CRI, likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy
- Creatinine stable while in hospital (d/c Cr 1.5)
*
8. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, H2 blocker, aspiration precautions
*
9. To [**Hospital1 **] for rehab.

1. ANTICOAGULATION. Please start anticoagulation with coumadin
on Sunday night, and check INR again at least by Wednesday
morning. Goal INR should be 2.5-3.0 in the setting of the
patient's resolving intra
