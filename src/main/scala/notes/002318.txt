[**2190-10-13**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with infero-lateral akinesis. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
[**2190-10-13**] Carotid Ultrasound:
No stenosis of the right ICA. Less than 40% left ICA stenosis.
[**2190-10-15**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
20 %).
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-BYPASS

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81870**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. Workup included
echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound - please see result
section for results. He remained pain free on medical therapy.
His preoperative course was otherwise uneventful and he was
cleared for surgery.

On [**10-15**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, he was brought
to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. On postoperative day
two, following removal of pleural chest tubes, chest x-ray was
notable for a 15% right pneumothorax. He eventually
decompensated which required re-intubation with placement of a
chest tube. Over the next 24 hours, his oxygenation improved and
he was re-extubated without incident.

He was transferres to the step down floor on POD 4. The chest
tube was removed on POD 7. Repeat CXR on POD 8 showed resolution
of small right apical pneumothorax.  Patient passed physical
therapy and was cleared to be discharged to his sisters house
where he will stay for 2 weeks before returning to [**State 1727**].
