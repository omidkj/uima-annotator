Imaging:
Head CT [**4-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval resection of the left cavernous sinus and
suprasellar
mass with postoperative pneumocephalus and a sliver of high
attenuation which
may represent a questionable small postoperative subdural
hematoma. Minimal
mass effect with gyral effacement without significant shift of
midline
structures.

MRI Head [**4-7**]:
FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone
left frontal
craniotomy. The previously seen hyperintense mass in the left
cavernous sinus and suprasellar region has been resected. A
small signal abnormality seen in the anterior left cavernous
sinus could represent a small area of residual mass. The
suprasellar mass as well as the posterior cavernous sinus mass
had been completely resected. There is no evidence of acute
infarct seen. Small amount of blood is seen along the tentorium
and in the subdural region on the left side, which appears
postoperative in nature. Small fluid-fluid level is also seen at
the left frontal subdural region with air, which is related to
surgery. No abnormal intraparenchymal enhancement is identified
or midline shift seen. No hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: Since the previous MRI examinations, the left
cavernous sinus
mass has been resected. A tiny area of signal abnormality in the
anterior
portion of the left cavernous sinus could be due to residual
lesion but
majority of the mass has been resected. Known expected
postoperative findings are seen. No acute infarct identified. No
evidence of enhancing brain lesions seen.

Head CT [**4-8**]:
FINDINGS: Left frontal/temporal craniotomy is again seen.
Pneumocephalus has decreased since [**2136-4-4**]. There is a small
left frontal extraaxial, probably epidural collection of blood
and air, and a small left frontal subdural blood collection,
which are separated by surgicel, stable since [**2136-4-6**]. Mass
effect on the left frontal lobe and the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left
lateral ventricle is unchanged. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved, and there is no evidence of a
large acute infarct. A small hypodense extraaxial collection is
again seen anterior to the left temporal lobe. There is minimal
mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses.
IMPRESSION: No change compared to [**2136-4-6**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was electively admitted on [**4-4**] for craniotomy(left) to
resect skull base mass.  Post-operatively he was transferred to
the ICU for monitoring.  After an uneventful stay,, he was
transferred to the Neurosurgery floor where PT and OT worked
with him, and determined he was appropriate for home discharge.
Due to his ongoing back pain, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] requested that he
return in follow up with a MRI of the lumbar spine.  At the time
of discharge, he had no neurologic findings suggestive of acute
cord compression.  He was discharged with appropriate pain
medication and follow up in the brain tumor clinic.
