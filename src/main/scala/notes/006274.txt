History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 29M with PMH of polysubstance drug abuse and
HepC who was found down by his car with no obvious signs of
trauma.  He was confused and combative at the scene complaining
of leg pain to the EMS personnel and had a GCS of > 8 initially.
 He was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, the patient had a GCS of <8 and was being evaluated
for an advanced airway when he lost his pulse.  EKG revealed PEA
and thus he received CPR, epinephrine *2, and atropine *1.  He
then transitioned to a wide complex rhythm that was still
pulseless.  Therefore, he underwent defibrillation and regained
his pulse.  In the ED the patient also had an ET tube placed and
proceeded to have bilateral tube thoracostomies for bilateral
pneumothoraces found after he had absent breath sounds
bilaterally.  After stabilization, he was transferred to the
MICU for further management. Urine toxicology screen in the ED
was positive for opiates, benzodiazepines, and cocaine.
