Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3645**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain, buttock pain and exacerbated leg pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

and foraminotomies bilaterally at the L5 nerve roots.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1391**] was having anterior quads symptoms and leg
symptoms that were on top of her acute chronic back pain.  She
is currently on MS Contin and Neurontin.  She is [**8-28**] at rest,
[**9-27**] with activity.  However, she is almost 90% back pain and
this is what stops her and not leg pain.  She has had
significant benefit from mild ablation in her back previously.
Her thigh pain has certainly settled down on the Neurontin.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2115-7-11**]):    NO GROWTH.

ECHO [**2115-7-11**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is asymmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy (basal septal wall thickness 2.0 cm).
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no resting LVOT
obstruction, but with the Valsalva manuever, a small (12 mmHg)
gradient is elicited. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Asymmetric septal left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved biventricular systolic function. Mild LVOT gradient
with Valsalva maneuver. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

CT scan head [**2115-7-11**]
1. No acute intracranial pathology.
2. Apparent effacement of the right parietal and temporal sulci
are likely
due to motion and artifact, particularly in light of the
patient's resolving
delirium and lack of focal neurologic deficits. These findings
were discussed
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3646**] [**Name (STitle) 3647**] at 9 p.m. on [**2115-7-10**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1391**] was admitted for her elective lumbar spine surgery
for spinal stenosis.  She was indentified in the holding area
and brought back to the OR for her lumbar decompression. The
procedure was complicated by a large dural tear.  She did
tolerate the procedure well.  She was then brought to the PACU
and then brought to the general floor.  Once on the floor, she
had O2 saturation into the 70-80s with hypercarbic blood gas and
lethergy secondary to her morphine pain meds.  Chest radiographs
and symptoms were consistant with CHF.  She was given narcan and
transfered to the TSICU and intubated.  She remaind in the TSICU
were she was kept intubated for five days.  There were no event
in the TSICU and she remained hemodynamically stable.  Once
extubated, she was brought to the floor.  Once to the floor
medicine was consulted to workup her CHF vs COPD symptoms.  She
was d/c'd from morphine and her mental status improved.  She did
work with physical therapy.  The rest of her hospital course was
unremarkable.

1. CHF- Echo showed asymmetric septal left ventricular
hypertrophy consistant with cardiomyopathy with sinus pause
secondary to sleep apnea.

2. menatl status changes- there was concern for meningitis
concerning her intra-op dural tear and intracranial pathology.
CT was negative for pathology and her status did return once out
of the TSICU and off morphine.
