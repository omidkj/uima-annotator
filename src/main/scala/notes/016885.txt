COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2123-2-15**].

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac silhouette remains mildly
enlarged.
The aorta is tortuous. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
otherwise
unremarkable. Lungs are clear without pleural effusion. No
pneumothorax. No acute osseous abnormality is seen.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2123-4-23**] Renal Ultrasound
INDICATION: Patient is a 79-year-old female with renal failure.
Evaluate for
hydronephrosis or perinephric hematoma.

EXAMINATION: Renal ultrasound.

COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to MR examination from [**2121-4-25**].

FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 9.4 cm.

Left kidney measures 9.6 cm.

Both kidneys are symmetric in size. Located arising from the
upper pole of
the right kidney, there is a 2.4 x 2.3 x 2.7 cm simple cyst and
located
arising from the interpolar region of the left kidney, there is
a 2.6 x 1.7 x 2.4 cm simple cyst. These are little changed since
examination from [**4-8**]. The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable
with no evidence of hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or discrete
masses. The bladder is collapsed about a Foley catheter,
limiting evaluation.

IMPRESSION: Unremarkable renal ultrasound with no evidence of
hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collections.

[**2123-4-23**]: Preliminary CXR PA&Lateral
No evidence of pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 79 year old female with PMH of thrombocytopenia,
anemia, asthma, and CKI who presented with dyspnea, chills,
headache, dark stools, and one episode of NBNB emesis and found
to have thrombocytopenia likely secondary to ITP, fever of
unknown source, and guaiac positive stool.
.
#. Thrombocytopenia: Likely ITP in the setting of
myelodysplastic syndrome.  She was seen by hematology and
started on prednisone 60mg daily on [**4-23**].  Her platelets nadired
at 9 and was 27 at the time of discharge ([**2123-4-29**]).  She will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] in 1 week to re-check her platelets
and discuss tapering of her steroids.  Her aspirin was held.
.
#. Anemia/Guaiac positive stool: The patient's Hct was decreased
to 22.8 on admission from baseline of high 20s previously.  The
differential was mild GI bleed vs. decreased production.  She
was seen by GI and recommended outpatient follow-up after her
thrombocytopenia resolved.  Her Hct remained stable and was 29
on the day of discharge.
.
#. Fever: The patient had fevers of an unclear source.
Infectious workup included negative C diff negative [**4-23**], urine
culture negative [**4-22**], and negative blood cultures.  She was
empirically treated with Vancomycin/Zosyn/Levaquin, but were d/c
on after negative infectious workup.
.
#. [**Last Name (un) **]: The patient's creatinine was up to 1.5 on admission from
baseline of 1.1. It was unlikely prerenal as has not resolved
with IVFs.  Renal U/S [**4-
