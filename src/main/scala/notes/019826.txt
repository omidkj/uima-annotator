LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Head CT showed left
traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and left subdural hematoma in
the parietal region with small intraparenchymal contusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU for
close neurological monitoring.  The patient had an ICP
monitor placed on [**2170-6-12**] for decreased mental status.  His
ICP was 20-23 on insertion.  There were no complications with
insertion.

On [**2170-6-13**], the patient did not follow commands, was moving
less spontaneously, moving the upper extremities
spontaneously.  His pupils were 1 mm and pinpoint.  The
patient had a central line placed on [**2170-6-13**] for IV access.
On [**2170-6-14**], there was no eye opening, moving his right side
spontaneously, localizing the left upper extremity.  The
pupils continued to be pinpoint.  He was on fluid restriction
and all medications were put in normal saline for a low
sodium level of 133.  His SBP was kept below 140.

The patient had a repeat head CT on [**2170-6-17**] which was
unchanged.  He continued to have his ICP monitor in place and
his ICP was running in the 20s when the patient became
agitated.  [**Last Name (un) **] bolt was discontinued on [**2170-6-17**] due
to stable head CT. The patient also had voluble neurologic
examination.  His pupils were 2 mm an brisk, moving all
extremities, left greater than right.  He had periods of
agitation, unable to follow commands.  The patient was on
Levaquin for pneumonia and Kefzol prophylactically for ICP
monitor.

On [**2170-6-18**], the patient spiked to 102, was fully
cultured, continues to require q. one hour suctioning for
thick yellow secretions on levofloxacin for supposed
pneumonia and Kefzol prophylaxis for drain placement.

On [**2170-6-21**], the patient was trached without
complication.  On [**2170-6-22**], the patient attempted to open his
eyes, looking around the room, continues to move all
extremities, following commands on the left upper
extremities, spontaneous on the left, and localizing on the
right side.

On [**2170-6-27**], the patient had PEG placement due to inability
to take p.o. nutrition.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well.  His G tube site is clean, dry, and intact.  His vital
signs have remained stable.  The patient was on levofloxacin
for Serratia pneumonia grown out on [**2170-6-24**], [**2170-6-25**], and
[**2170-6-29**].  Vital signs have remained stable.  He has been off
the ventilator for over 48 hours, tolerating a trach collar,
requiring q. two hour suctioning.  His vital signs, as
stated, have remained stable and neurologically he was
unchanged.  He was awake, briskly opens his eyes, nods his
head okay, moves upper extremities spontaneously, left
greater than right and spontaneous movement in his lower
extremities.

He will be discharged to rehabilitation with follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in one month with a repeat head CT.
