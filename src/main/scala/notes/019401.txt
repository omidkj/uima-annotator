No left or right upper extremity DVT. Left [**Month/Day/Year **] patent, right
[**Month/Day/Year **]
occluded. Small fluid collection adjacent to left [**Month/Day/Year **] may be
hematoma,
although, underlying infection cannot be excluded.

[**2113-11-18**]
INDICATION:  Bilateral lower extremity question of DVT, fevers.
COMPARISON:  Left lower extremity ultrasound on [**2113-11-13**].
FINDINGS:  There is normal phasicity in the common femoral veins
bilaterally.
There is normal compression and augmentation of the common
femoral,
superficial femoral, popliteal, peroneal, and posterior tibial
veins of the right and left legs.

CT Chest [**11-17**]
1.  16-mm foreign body lodged in the mid esophagus just above
the carina and
similar structure present in the stomach since [**2113-11-16**]; likely
pills.
2.  Right lower lobe opacification compatible with aspiration or
pneumonia.
3.  Right middle lobe atelectasis.
3.  Atrophic right kidney and cystic left kidney with
surrounding fat
stranding.  Though this appears relatively unchanged from prior
CT, infectious
process cannot be excluded.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Urinary bladder thickening may represent infection in the
proper setting.
6.  Pancreatic duct prominence, not visualized on prior CT.  If
indicated,
this can be further evaluated by MRCP.
