Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2101-8-23**] and was enrolled in the
cooling study for renal protection during cardiac cath. He had
an MI by enzymes on admission. He had the catheterization on
[**8-25**] and it revealed: a 50-60% stenosis of the LAD, 90% diagonal
lesion, 80% proximal LCX stenosis, and a 90% RCA lesion. His EF
is 20%. During the cath. he became hypotensive and bradycardic
and required atropine and dopamine.  He had an IABP placed and
cardiac surgery was consulted for high risk CABG. He then
developed ologuric renal failure and responded to high doses of
lasix.
On [**2101-8-29**] he underwent CABGx3 with LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the
PDA and ramus.  He was transferred to the CSRU on Epi, Lido, and
Propofol in stable condition. He had some bleeding on the post
op night and required 3U PRBC, 2 of platelets, and 1 of cryo.
He had decreased urine output and was started on a lasix drip
and natracor.  He continued to require these drips for several
days and remained intubated until POD#3.  His creat. was between
3.2 and 4, but he continued to have adequate urine output.  His
IABP was d/c'd on POD#1.  He slowly improved and was transferred
to the floor on POD#7.  He developed cellulitis on his L leg and
has been treated with vanco. He continued to progress and was
discharged to rehab on POD# 10.
