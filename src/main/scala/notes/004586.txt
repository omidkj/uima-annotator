History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 73 year old man w/ CAD s/p CABG [**2110**] and [**2125**],
chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and PVD. Recently dc'd
from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 41968**]) following new dx of R hallux
osteomyelitis, epidural abscess and MRSA bacteremia. BxCx + for
MRSA ([**3-21**]).  Started on vancomycin.
.
Course c/b development of epidural abscess, discovered [**1-19**] back
pain and ongoing + bxcx's, extending from sacrum to T5. Req'd
T4-L5 laminectomy [**2135-9-20**]. The cervical portion of the abscess
could not be drained in the OR and plan was made for treatement
with vancomycin. Hospital course was complicated by persistant
fevers and elevated wbc. Patient was started on
flagyl/cefepime/vanc. Flagyl and cefepime were d/c'd as cultures
were all negative. Initial CT showed residual epidural abscess
at C1-C5. Patient continued on vancomycin. Repeat MRI showed
improvement in cervical abscess. Underwent R hallux amputation
[**2135-10-4**].
.
Also developed Tn leak (0.48 x3)-> consistent w/demand ischemia,
medically managed. Patient was diagnosed with parkinson's and
started on sinemet. He had dysphagia and failed a speech and
swallow evaluation and a peg tube was placed. He had persistant
Afib with difficult rate control. Patient was discharged to
[**Hospital1 **].
.
Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**10-25**] with new onset ARF and
fever. By report, pt had been doing well until monday before
admission when his cr was noted to be 1.2 (by report, not
verified in documentation). On admission noted to be 3.3 (bun
60), random vancomycin lev 63. [**10-24**] u/s at [**Hospital1 **] w/o
hydronephrosis. tte showed lvef 40%mild to mod MR, AV
thickeened,. Grad peak 21, mean 10. RVSP 38, septal HK.
Transferred for further w/u of ARF.
.
While on the medical service he had an episode of acute
hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure thought to be due
aspiration. He was intubated and was in the MICU for two days.
.
On [**11-6**] patient had another acute respiratory event. He
desaturated to 84% and was tachypnic to 30s and diaphoretic. His
sat was 94% on 50% FM. He was intubated for respiratory failure.
After intubation his blood pressure dropped to 50/P. He was
started on levophed and blood pressure improved.

bacteremia c/b spinal abscess requiring laminectomy, admitted
for ARF and dehydration, s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 153**] stay/intubation for
respiratory failure.  Poor MS.
.
# Respiratory failure- [**1-19**] aspiration, CHF, for Acinetobacter
baumannii pna.
- Patient was extubated [**11-8**] AM  .Sats 95% 2 lt of O2. Last ABG
c PCO2 of 45.O2 80.
- BAL results show WBC 0, RBC 0, PMN 27%, Lymphs 27%, Macro 46%,
and shows +Acinetobacter
- Given  Imipenem, inhaled Tobramycin (since [**11-7**]) switched
later to Unasyn ([**11-10**]).Patient finished 2 week course .CxR
prior to discharge c no residual infiltrates.
- CT chest shows ground glass opacities indicative of CHF or
pulm edema, nodular opacities indicative of infectious process

#ID :Pt had epidural abscess after low extremity
osteomyelitis.S/P Laminectomy [**10-25**].
He finished a 60 day course of Vancomycin [**11-18**].Complete spine
MRI done [**2135-11-18**] c no evidence of osteo or residual disease.ID
recommends f/u on [**12-2**] c Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. He will need ESR, CBC,
UA.
.
# ARF- Pre-renal and ATN.  Cr improved now 1.4 (from
3.5).Probably multifactorial.Captopril restarted [**11-14**] .There
was no worsening hyperkalemia or renal failure.

# # Afib/flutter - Currently in afib/flutter, BP tolerating well

- continue rate control with Metoprolol and digoxin
- restarted coumadin [**2135-11-3**] - goal INR [**1-20**], INR currently
therapeutic at 2.2
 Needs to f/u INR.
.
# CHF - Probably ischemic in origin.EF 40% with 3+ MR and mild
LVH. On transfer had crackles bilaterally [**12-19**] way up. Likely
some volume overload and decompensation.
Pt currently on ASA, Metoprolol, Captopril and Digoxin.Has
remained euvolemic without use of  LAsix.

#Neuro: Pt MS has been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]. Per family MS was
completely normal prior to laminectomy.
CT showed microvacular infarcts c/w microvascular dementia.
Neurology followed. Attributed MS changes to metabolic
derrangements and prolonged hopsital course in pt c damaged
brain.B12 levels, RPR, ammonia, TSH were nl.
No further MRI needed at this point.
-Continue coumadin and ASA.
.
# fen - Passes speech/swallow but aspirated. Continue TFs Nepro
with goal 55cc/hr, was changed to Procare-goal of 80cc/hr on
[**11-11**]. CaCO3 for phos binding. Continue aspiration precautions.

-video swallow when mental status improves
.
# code - full but no prolonged intubation
.
# Access - Left SC line was d/c'd [**11-11**] Tip sent for cultures.
PICC d/ced prior to d/c.
# Commmunication. Daughter [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known lastname 41969**] and wife [**Name (NI) 6303**] can be
