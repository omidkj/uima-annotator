Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
" I had a stroke "

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and extubation
tracheostomy
PEG placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient can currently not give a coherent history. He can
only contribute that he had a stroke and fell after feeling sick
a few days ago. The following history and PMH is obtained from
the medical records and through his wife.
.
70 y/o gentleman with past medical history significant ischemic
stroke, HTN, hyperlipidemia and diabetes presents after 2 days
of
gait instability and dizziness. Symptoms were first noted after
getting up at his usual time around 4 AM on Tuesday [**2154-4-2**]. He
was so unsteady on his feet that he stayed in bed most of that
day. On [**2154-4-3**] he fell backwards striking the back of his head
while trying to put on his shoes. Despite this he drove to work
but because he continued to feel unwell he called his son to
take
him to the hospital. There, he was hypertensive in the 170s and
head CT revealed a small frontal SAH. He was admitted to the
medical ICU for neurological monitoring. An MRI head showed a L
cerebellar ischemic stroke as well as poorly visualized
vertebral
artery concerning for dissection. Given the extent of his
infarct
he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for dedicated neuroicu care.

**FINAL REPORT [**2154-4-17**]**

   C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final [**2154-4-17**]):
      Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA
      amplification assay.
           (Reference Range-Negative).

NCCT [**2154-4-4**]: Atrophy, extensive SVD, bilateral hypodensities
in the cortico-subcortical [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] suggesting prior ischemic stroke
(?embolic). Left cerebellar hypodensity. No significant mass
effect on my review.
.
NCCT: [**2154-4-3**]: Small, left frontal SAH. OTW no acute pathology.
.
MRI Brain [**2154-4-3**]: Left cerebellar infarct in PICA-territory.
Several DWI-hyperintense lesions in the left frontal cortex,
consistent with SAH. Susceptibility imaging shows SAH.
MRA neck [**2154-4-3**]: Poorly visualized left vertebral artery.
Carotid arteries unremarkable.
MRA head [**2154-4-3**]: Very limited. No major pathology.

NCHCT [**2154-4-4**]
CONCLUSION:

1. Regional hypodensity of left cerebellar hemisphere is
compatible with
history of prior infarction. No evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage or mass
effect. MR may be obtained for further evaluation if not
contraindicated.

2. Subdural spaces are prominent, though determination of
chronicity is
pending review of Atrius images.

NOTE ON FURTHER REVIEW:

The prior OSH studies are scanned onto [**Hospital1 18**] PACS and available
for review on
[**2154-4-5**].
The hypodense area in the left cerebellar hemisphere is more
conspicuous
compared to the CT Head study of [**2154-4-3**]. There is mild
distortion of the
4th ventricle compared to prior, allowing for the technical
differences.

CXR [**2154-4-4**]
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with an AP and
lateral
chest view obtained at another institution and transferred in
our image
system. The heart size is probably mildly enlarged, precise
assessment is
impossible on this portable AP chest view obtained with patient
in
semi-upright position. No typical configurational abnormality is
seen. The
pulmonary vasculature is not congested, and the lateral pleural
sinuses are
free. No pneumothorax in the apical area. No evidence of acute
infiltrates
on this portable single view chest examination. When comparison
is made with
a previous AP and lateral chest examination from the other
institution, there
is again no evidence of any acute pulmonary infiltrate or
pulmonary
congestion. Prominent breast shadows bilaterally in this adipose
patient
suggest the possibility of gynecomasty.

[**2154-4-5**] TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The inferior and posterior
walls appear hypokinetic but the technically suboptimal nature
of this study precludes definitive seg
