Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal extubation

History of Present Illness:
*Per OSH records as patient could not provide limited history
while intubated and sedated*
41 yo gentleman with h/o acromegaly and diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (s/p admission at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2144-7-11**] to [**2144-11-12**])
who was transferred from [**Hospital6 5016**] following episode
of altered mental status early today that led to intubation for
airway protection. Patient had a head CT performed at [**Hospital 40796**] which was reported as showing right temporal and
parietal edema and small foci of hemorrhage, though the images
were not sent with the patient upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. According
to discharge paperwork from [**Hospital3 **] today, the patient
originally presented to the hospital on [**2144-12-21**] with
intractable nausea and vomiting of 5 days duration. While at
[**Hospital3 **], the patient had several abdominal films as well as
an upper GI series which were reportedly unremarkable.
Physicians were concerned that there was a central cause of
nausea and attempted head imaging, which the patient initially
refused. Late on night of [**2144-10-23**], patient was found to be
minimally responsive with head turning to right and arms flexed
to chest. As he had received nortriptyline, there was initial
concern for a dystonic reaction and 50 mg IV diphenhydramine was
pushed. There was no improvement in his mental status following
that intervention and he was intubated for ariway protection and
head CT was then performed with results as above. Transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] was requested given patient's decline in mental status
requiring intubation.

Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 5016**]
on [**12-14**] with hypercalcemia and a pseudomonas infection of stage
IV pressure ulcer. He completed antibiotic course of
ceftazidime, daptomycin, and azithromycin.

Unknown level of ambulation immediately prior to presentation to
[**Hospital6 5016**] on [**2144-12-21**]; however, at time of discharge
from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-11-12**], he could stand and walk about 10 feet.
A recent neurology note from [**2144-12-4**] assessed his IP strength
as being 1 on the right and 0 on the left. He was assessed as
having "residual severe paraparesis due to combination of
deconditioning and vincristine toxic polyneuropathy, and
question of critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy."

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
*extremely limited due to intubated and sedated status of
patient*

Past Medical History:
1) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Stage IVB with CNS
involvement:
- hospitalization from [**2144-7-11**] - [**2144-11-12**]
- oringinally had Bell's Palsy, urinary retention, and LE
weakness; transferred to [**Hospital1 **] with labs suggestive of tumor lysis
syndrome
- bone marrow biopsy demonstrated Burkitt-like high grade
lymphoma
- imaging showed lymphangitic spread to lung, stomach, ureters
- severe scrotal swelling felt to be due to tumor involvement
- LP demonstrated malignant cells.
- first treated with hyper-CVAD systemically and intrathecal
chemotherapy with MTX and cytarabine starting the first week of
[**Month (only) 205**]
- then treated with R-[**Hospital1 **] alternating with HD MTX. Vincristine
was stopped due to concern that it might be causing severe
polyneuropathy
- treatment complicated by mucositis and pancytopenia requiring
neupogen
- now in remission
2) Pituitary Macroadenoma
3) Acromegaly
4) h/o Respiratory Failure with ARDS requiring mechanical
ventilation [**2144-7-12**] to [**2144-7-30**] -- did well with PSV, had
large TV (700-800) and MV (>10)
5) h/o Mycoplasma hominis PNA treated with cipro and doxy
6) Sinus Tachycardia with PVCs -- had significant work-up with
TSH, TTE. Felt to be physiologic given lymphoma, infection,
acromegaly.
7) Lower extremity paraparesis attributed to leptomeningeal
involvement of his lymphoma, vincristine toxicity, and critical
care myopathy.
- received IVIG for possible paraneoplastic syndrome, but
stopped b/c of low IgA
8) h/o DVT [**2144-8-15**], plan for at least 6 months of lovenox
9) Stage IV Sacral ulcer, required surgical debridements
10) h/o Bell's Palsy -- unclear if [**2-17**] acromegaly or Burkitt's
11) Constipation requiring aggressive bowel regimen
12) Peripheral neuropathy
13) h/o keratitis and right corneal ulcer, Cx grew coag neg
staph, s/p right lid approximation
14) h/o Diffuse Joint Pain thought to be from acromegaly, on
methadone
15) h/o right tibial fracture

1. Limited study due to patient motion despite five repeat
attempts.
2. Round mild densities in the temporal lobes, and possibly
increased density interdigitating with the sulci. Note
additional history obtained of Burkitt's lymphoma. The findings
may relate to lymphoma involvement, less likely parenchymal and
subarachnoid hemorrhage, though not quite as dense as typical
hemorrhage products, especially in temporal lobes.
3. Enlarged pituitary gland, better evaluated on recent MR
pituitary.
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4011**] at 9:00 p.m.
[**2144-12-24**], at which time MRI had been ordered and the patient had
been brought for MRI.

[**12-25**] MRI, MRV, MRA head
1. Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and FLAIR hyperintensity
involving the right greater than left temporal and parietal
lobes, with more focal areas of parenchymal abnormality in the
temporal lobe, also right greater than left.  Differential
diagnostic considerations primarily include recurrent lymphoma
(especially given the patient's history of Burki
