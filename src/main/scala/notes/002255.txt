=======================IMAGING========================
ABDOMINAL PLAIN FILM
FINDINGS:

Supine and lateral decubitus views of the abdomen demonstrate
small amount of residual barium remaining in the stomach. There
are multiple dilated loops of small and large bowel and
air-fluid levels. There is no pneumatosis or free air.
Visualized osseous structures appear intact.

IMPRESSION:

Multiple dilated small and large bowel loops, compatible with
ileus. No
definite evidence of gastric outlet obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
An 88 yoM with PMH CABG, CHF LVEF 25-30%, metastatic colon
cancer readmitted with worsening diarrhea.
.
# Hypotension: On arrival to the ED, patient was hypotensive to
76/45, he was mentating well, but was noted to be in acute renal
failure. He was admitted to the ICU where he was resuscitated
with 7L IVNS with stabilization of pressures and good urine
output. Vasoactive medications were not necessary. He was then
called out to the Oncology service for further care.
.
# Diarrhea: Previously attributed to chemotherapy, diarrhea had
been improving until 3 days prior to admission. On admission, he
was afebrile with epigastric tenderness, labs were remarkable
for WBC 3.4 and 20% bands. He was treated with PO Vanco and
metronidazole IV for presumed C. Diff. Stool was negative for
C.diff x 2, so Flagyl and vancomycin were dicontinued. C diff
PCR was negative. WBC count normalized and the patient was
afebrile. Diarrhea was ultimately felt to be [**12-20**] chemotherapy as
all infectious stool studies were negative.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Creatinine 3.6 on admission up
from baseline of 1.5-1.7. With crystalloid resuscitation,
creatinine trended down to baseline. Acute injury is attributed
to low right sided filling pressures in the setting of poor po
intake and diarrhea.Cr was stable throughout the rest of his
admission.
.
# Ileus: on admission, CT abdomen showed no passage of contrast
beyond pylorus concerning for gastric outlet obstruction. He
reported vomiting x 2days shortly after meals. Repeat abdominal
plain film showed passage of contrast and gas into the large and
small bowel and dialated loops of large and small bowel
consistent with ileus. An NG tube was placed to decompress the
intestine. NGT was removed prior to transfer to the Oncology
floor. His diet was advanced,a dn her was tolerating a regular
diet for several days prior to discharge.
.
# Chronic congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction:
LVEF 30% to 35% Chest xray from admission shows small pleural
effusions. He had trace peripheral edema but did not appear to
be in acute CHF exacerbation. After aggressive volume
resuscitation, he appeared euvolemic and did not develop acute
CHF. Furosemide had been held in prior admission. The patient
had one episode of SOB on the floor that resolved with IV Lasix.
Otherwise, diuresis was held. In fact, he required a few boluses
of D5W for hypernatremia [**12-20**] intravascular dryness. Pt was
taking good po, and Na was stable for 48 hours prior to
discharge.
.
# Coronary artery disease: Patient with PMH of CABG. Complained
of chest pressure on admission, EKG was unchanged, Trops
negative x 3. Ruled out for myocardial infarction.
.
# A fib: Pt has a history of pAF for which he was previously on
Coumadin. His metoprolol had been stopped on admission. Coumadin
had been stopped [**12-20**] hematemesis. Pt had an episode of AF with
RVR. His rate slowed down with metoprolol, which was titrated to
25mg [**Hospital1 **]; he will be discharged on 50mg metoprolol su
