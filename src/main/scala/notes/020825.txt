Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
75 y/o woman with a history of moderate asthma, and recent
mediastinal mass, who presents with dyspnea and chest
discomfort.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 724**] is a 75 year old woman with history of asthma,
allergies and hypertension. One week ago ([**6-15**]), she noticed a
worsening dry, non productive cough she had an xray on [**6-15**]
which did not demonstrate evidence of pneumonia. Her cough
worsened and she noticed chest tightness.  She noticed that the
pain was persistent and did not flucuate with breathing. She
localized the pain to the center of her chest. Her cough and
discomfort progressed to the point that she requested that her
daughter stay with her because her condition made her feel
unsafe alone.  She noted that on [**6-18**] that she had vomitted in
the setting of her cough (non bloody). She noted blurry vision,
tingling in the hands and feet, bouts of chills, an elevated
temp at 99.6, five pound weight loss (over 1 month). The night
before admission, Ms [**Known lastname 724**] had a particularly sever episode of
coughing with chest pain. She requested that her son take her to
the ER.

Swallow-study [**2113-6-28**]
Mrs. [**Known lastname 724**] presents with a mild pharyngeal dysphagia at this time
primarily characterized by impaired airway closure from left
vocal cord immobility/paresis with resulting aspiration of
liquids. When a chin tuck maneuver was combined with smaller
sips
of liquids, aspiration of thin liquids was easily prevented.
However, the pt requires larger sips of thin liquids to swallow
pills. As such, I am recommending that pills be taken whole with
purees for the time being. Follow up video swallow study can be
completed in the next 2-3 months to monitor status of the pt's
dysphagia, either here as an outpatient or at rehab/other
facility.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Advance to regular texture po diet with thin liquids. Pills
may be given whole with liquids.
2. Aspiration precautions, including:
 a. Tuck your chin to your chest when drinking liquids.
 b. Take small sips of liquids!!
3. Repeat video swallow study in the next 2-3 months to monitor
dysphagia and pending ENT intervention.

CXR: [**2113-6-26**]
Heterogeneous opacity in the right upper lung has progressed
since [**6-25**] following removal of the pleural tube. The apical
component is conceivably atelectasis or hemorrhage related to
retraction during surgery, but a more focal region in the
axillary portion of the right upper lobe developed between [**6-23**] and [**6-25**] and has grown slightly since. There is also
progressive left perihilar and basal consolidation. Overall
findings are concerning for bilateral pneumonia and/or severe
atelectasis at the left base. Small right apical pneumothorax is
new or newly apparent. There is no left pneumothorax, but there
is a small and slightly increased left pleural effusion,
following removal of the left pleural tube. Mediastinal caliber
is comparable to that on [**6-23**], but there is vascular
engorgement, and the heart is top normal size.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mediastinal Mass: Likely Thymoma
Lymphoma, teratoma, thyroid/parathyroid tumor ruled out with
history, exam, and normal tsh, pth, ionized Ca, and Phos.
Neurology evaluated for myasthenia, negative for fatigability.
Ms. [**Known lastname 724**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a resection of her anterior mediastinal mass
on [**6-23**].  For details of the procedure please see the operative
report.  Of note there was a thoracic duct injury noted intraop
which was later clipped.  A JP drain was left in place at the
level of the thoracic duct injury to assess for a chyle leak
postop.  Two chest were left in place postoperatively as well.
Preliminary pathology at the time of the procedure was
significant for a fibrous tumor and not thymoma.
Postoperatively she was transferred extubated to the SICU.  Both
chest tubes were left to suction and no air leak was noted. Her
sodium was noted to be 131 postop.  She remained NPO overnight.
On POD1 her diet was advanced and her pain was controlled with a
dilaudid PCA now controlled with percocet. Both chest tubes were
removed on POD2, however the JP drain was left in place until
she was taking a significant amount of oral intake.  Over the
first few postoperative days she was noted to have a
significantly hoarse voice and difficulty swallowing.  ENT was
consulted out of concern for a recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.
 She had an FOE exam on POD3 which confirmed an immobile left
true vocal cord.  Seen by speech and swallow pathology and
cleared for regular diet with thin liquids and chin tuck. (see
report in result section).

Hyponatremia: Likely euvolemic hyponatremia due to SIADH
considering mediastinal mass. Serum osm of 260 is less
ooncentrated than normal, while Urine osm of 144 is
inappropriatedly concentrated. This is consistent with euvolemic
hyponatremia. The sodium should be corrected slowly (by half per
day). She has been getting fluid restriction to 1000 cc per day.
Her mental status has been perfect, and her sodium levels have
been improving. We are holding her HCTZ, which could have
contributed.  After the procedure her her hyponatremia was
stable at around 130 and the hctz was restarted without further
lowering her sodium.

Cough/Chest pain: While originally thought to be an asthma
exacerbation an intraop bronchoscopy showed significant purulent
drainage from the right middle lobe.  A BAL was positive for
MSSA which was treated with vancomycin for 3 days and then was
changed to levaquin and course was completed upon discharge from
the hospital.

UTI: A preop UA was noted to be positive and the urine culture
was positive for pansensitive E.Coli.  The patient was
complaining of dysuria and hesitency.  The UTI was treated with
3 days of ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin and a repeat urine culture
was negative.

Activity: The patient was seen by physical therapy and rehab was
recommended.  She was discharged to rehab on [**6-29**].
