Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Acute Respiratory Failure:  Pt was admitted with acute
hypoxic/hypercapnic respiratory failure and emergently
transferred to the MICU.  She was intubated and placed on AC
ventilation without problem.  [**Name (NI) **] follow up ABG's showed
adequate ventilation and oxygenation on the ventilator.  Her CXR
showed new bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that were consistent
with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema [**3-2**] hypertensive
emergency (i.e. forward failure due to increased afterload).
Since then, the pt has done well from a resp standpoint and was
extubated [**8-23**]. Discharged wtihout respiratory complaints.

2.  Hypertension:  Pt was admitted to MICU with SBP>180 and
treated with labetolol drip for 5-8 minutes before her BP
dropped to SBP 60's.  She was sedated with propofol prior to
this and her precipitous drop in MAP was thought to be [**3-2**]
propofol and vasovagal reaction from intubation.  She did
require dopamine and levophed and fluids (2L) to maintain her
SBP > 70.  This episode of shock lasted one hour and then his
resolved.  At that point her pressors were stopped and she
returned to SBP's > 170 again.

Her blood pressure significantly improved after dialysis with
removal of fluid and optimization of anti-HTN meds labetaolol,
valsartan, and norvasc.  Per pt's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is quite sensitive to
anti-hypertensives and is at risk for orthostatic hypotension.

HTN thought to be secondary to chronic volume overload and
significant vessel non-compliance. Plasma metanephrin was sent
off and pt ruled out for pheochromocytoma.

3.  Renal Failure:  Dialysis was attempted on pt [**8-22**] but failed
due to labile BP's.  Her systolics decreased to < 60's during
dialysis so it had to be stopped.  Dialysis will be attempted
today agian.Dialyzed off 3L on [**8-23**].7L on [**8-26**] and 1.6 L on
[**8-28**]

4. Hypercalcemia. Ca climbed to 12. This is in the light of PTH
trending down on admission to 134. SPEP sent to rule out
multiple myeloma. PTH-rp workup is to be done as outpt for
possible malignancy. Ca trending down to 11.5 following vitD
analog administration.

4.  Altered Mental Status:  Pt was admitted to the hospital for
altered mental status, per daughter, thought to be secondary to
hypertensive encephalopathy vs uremia vs. infection.
Experienced waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status in the MICU with ICU
psychosis.  Steadily improved to baseline MS with resolution of
HTN.

5.  Leukocytosis:  Pt developed an elevated WBC count after
being admitted to the MICU.  This was attributed to stress
response of being intubated.  Meningitis r/o by LP.
Leukocytosis resolved without antibiotics.

6. Anemia-secondary to ESRD. Fe studies, B12, folate studies
pending.
