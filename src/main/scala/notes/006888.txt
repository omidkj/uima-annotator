Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Diagnostic cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 yo female with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor on
home hospice, h/o CVA, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presented to the [**Hospital1 **]
emergency room with chest discomfort and malaise. She began
experiencing chest discomfort at 12:30 during the night, and
took some nitroglycerin with partial relief, but did not tell
the family because she was hoping it would resolve. By the
morning, patient was becoming dyspneic and felt nauseous, and
requested to come to the hospital. Chest pain had resolved on
arrival to [**Hospital1 **] Emergency room, but she was noted to have ST
elevations in III and aVF with prominent R-wave with ST
depressions in V1-V2. She was given aspirin 324mg, clopidogrel
600mg, aotrvastatin 80mg, eptifibatide 5mL bolus, heparin 3100
Unit bolus, metoprolol 5mg IV x 3, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
On arrival to cardiac catheterization lab at [**Hospital1 18**], patient was
noted to be hypertensive 200/85. She was started on
nitroglycerin continuous infusion. Left heart catheterization
demonstrated LVEDP of 40mmHg, LAD with diffuse disease and a 99%
mLAD stenosis, LCx with diffuse disease, 50% pLCx stenosis, 90%
mLCx lesion after OM1, 70% OM1, pRCA occlusion with large conus
with 80% stenosis giving collaterals to LAD and RCA. Given
elevated LVEDP, patient was given 80mg IV furosemide. She was
transferred to CCU for further management of blood pressure and
CHF.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG [**2185-2-16**] - Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2185-2-15**] the rate has slowed. The previously mentioned multiple
abnormalities persist without diagnostic interim change.
.
[**2185-2-15**] - Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate to severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an apical left
ventricular aneurysm and an inferobasal left ventricular
aneurysm. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

There is a small (~0.5 cm) mobile echodense structure adjacent
to the apical anterior wall consistent with probable thrombus.
.
Cardiac catherization - 1. Selective coronary angiography of
this right dominant system revealed three vessel disease. The
LMCA had mild disease.  The LAD was diffusely diseased with 99%
stenosis at the mid segment.  The LCX was diffusely diseased
with 50% stenosis at the proximal segment, 90% stenosis at the
mid segment after the first OM, and there was 70% stenosis
within the first OM.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided
filling
pressures consistent with diastolic dysfunction, with LVEDP 40
mm Hg. The systemic arterial pressure was elevated with central
aortic pressure 184/79 mm Hg.  Careful pullback across the
aortic valve did not reveal a significant gradient.
3. Patient was symptom free, and ECG done during catheterization
showed resolution of ST segment changes.  Conservative
management with blood pressure control and diuresis was elected
with plan for CT surgery consult.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo female with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, apical
aneurysm, CVA, CHF, presents with chest pain in setting of
uncontrolled hypertension now s/p cardiac catherization. As
patient was pain free with resolution of ST changes elected to
pursue conservative management with BP control and diuresis and
would consider PCI if recurrent symptoms.
.
# Chest pain: ST-elevations may have been secondary to
aneurysmal changes noted on [**Hospital3 4107**] echocardiogram and
confirmed on echocardiography today at [**Hospital1 18**]. Lack of
significant biomarker elevation suggests against significant
ischemic territorial STEMI, and angiography suggests chr
