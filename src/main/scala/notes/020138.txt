History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 89581**] is a 60 y/o female with htn, CAD, COPD, DM and HL
who presented to [**Hospital3 **] following increased weight gain and
sob.  She explains that she has gained some 28 lbs since [**Month (only) 205**].
She was first diagnosed with CHF in [**2151-8-5**].  She
endorses PND, orthopnea and sleeps elevated in a hospital bed on
2 or more pillows.  She has significant DOE and she can only
walk about 25 feet with her wheeled walker before she gets SOB.
She also endorses palpitations and rare chest pain "when she
gets upset." She denies fevers, chills, nasea, vomiting, cough,
hemoptysis or changes in bowels.  Her last BM was 2 days ago.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.  Cath showed
elevated right and left heart cath, wedge of 35.  Cuff pressures
30-40 mm hg less than central pressures.  No intervention.  She
was then transferred to the floor.
.
On the floor she feels tired and thirsty.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo F with Hx of CAD, CHF (EF 40-45%), DM, HTN, HL, COPD
presenting with major  CHF exacerbation, at least 50lbs up, and
hypotension.
.
# Acute on Chronic Sytolic and Diastolic Congestive Heart
Failure:  Patient presented with SOB, PND, Orthopnea, crackles
on exam, LE edema.  Most recent echo per report showed EF or
40-45% per report.  Cath showed  CO 3.5 L/min. Of note, her cuff
systolic BP's are 40 points lower than central BP measured in
cath lab. Initially diuresed with lasix drip on the floor, but
this was complicated by hypotension to SBP of 40. This value is
of unclear significance, given it was a cuff pressure and may
have been 40 points higher. She was transferred to the CCU for
diuresis with central BP monitoring. She was briefly on dopamine
but this was promptly stopped once it became clear that a SBP of
80's is normal for her. She was diuresed a total of ~35L
negative during admission, using a combination of lasix,
acetazolamide, and metolazone. She was also anemic (see below),
and was transfused 2 units pRBCs, which likely helped mobilize
fluid. Her edema is improved, but still has 2+ pitting edema up
to her waist. She has a ways to go for her diuresis but is now
on a stable regimen of lasix 80gm IV BID and spironolactone 25mg
PO daily. She should have her electrolytes checked twice daily
while she is being diuresed by IV doses (has a PICC line in).
Not currently on an ACEi as has been having problems with
hypotension but should be started after diuresis is finished.
Should be on a heart healthy, 2g sodium, 1.5L fluid restricted,
diabetic diet.
.
# Hypotension: Pt has extensive peripheral arterial disease, and
as such her systolic blood pressure measured with a cuff is
abotu 40mmHg LOWER than that measured centrally in the cardaic
cath lab. Systolic blood pressures in the 70's are tolerable for
her because of this.
.
# Hypokalemia: pt has been persistently hypokalemic during
diuresis, and is now on potassium 40mEq PO TID. S
