History of Present Illness:
Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 12761**]/07 for CHF
exacerbation. She ruled out for ischemia and was transitioned
from lasix gtt to Torsemide 100mg daily with good effect. On
discharge to [**Hospital **] rehab her family noted that though her
breathing and leg edema were much improved, she was still more
fatigued than at baseline. She did well at rehab until the last
few days PTA, when her family noted the pt to be markedly
fatigued, having difficulty speaking and walking to the bathroom
becuause she felt so tired. For 2d PTA the pt's family also
noticed that she was working harder to breathe and was
accumulating more fluid in her legs. Her family has not noted a
cough, nor has the pt complained of chest pain. 1 day PTA she
complained of abdominal pain and vomited x 1, but had excellent
po intake and no diarrhea or constipation. She was sent from
[**Hospital **] rehab to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation of
lethargy, SOB, and LE edema.

100% on NRB. She received Lasix 80mg IV x1, nitropaste 1". Per
report, she also got a dose of Levaquin prior to arrival in the
ED. ABG was 7.33/110/60, with lactate of 0.8. She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of presumed
hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

.
CT Head w/o contrast ([**2162-4-6**]):
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus,
shift of normally midline structures, or edema.  A linear area
of hyper-attenuation along the falx anteriorly is stable dating
back to [**2154-12-21**] and likely represents a small
meningioma.  The paranasal sinuses are well aerated.
.
CXR AP ([**2162-4-5**]):
Multiple regions of mid and lower lung zone opacity, which
appears new concerning for infection.  Likely small right
effusion.  A lateral view would be helpful. Mild pulmonary
vascular congestion.


Brief Hospital Course:
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was started on vanco/Zosyn for empiric coverage
of a suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was initally put
on BiPAP for her respiratory failure, though this was weaned
down to 2L n.c. Of note, her daughter/HCP choose to make her
DNR/DNI with no further positive pressure ventillation. Her
diuretics were held due to her renal failure and she was gently
hydrated with D5W with subsequent normalization of her
hypernatremia. Her code status was made DNR/DNI by her family,
who also wished that she not receive positive pressure
ventillation.
.
She was transferred to the floor where she was initially stable.
 Due to concern of L-sided weakness, a head CT was obtained
which showed no evidence of acute stroke.  On the morning after
transfer, she was found by her nurse lying on her side with
agonal breathing with approx 4-5 breaths/min.  Peripheral pulses
were thready and a NIBP was not obtainable.  Shortly thereafter,
the patient lost her pulses, stopped breathing, and expired.
Her family was notified and a post-mortem examination was
declined.
