Admission Date:  [**2178-2-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-2-11**]


Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
male with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary
artery disease with three vessel disease, and complete heart
block status post pacemaker implantation recently diagnosed
on [**2178-1-31**] after congestive heart failure
exacerbation and diuresis.  The patient had been ruled out
for myocardial infarction by CKs, but had a slight troponin
leak between [**2-9**], which was attributed to a congestive heart
failure.

He was diuresed effectively with Lasix, and started on
carvedilol, however, the patient was unable to tolerate this
secondary to hypotension, and it was therefore discontinued.
The patient was also evaluated by Electrophysiology for
question of atrial lead, anchored, and pacer was
interrogated, and found to be within normal limits.  The
patient is presenting at this time for increased shortness of
breath with a troponin of 35.  His anginal equivalent is
bilateral arm pain which he does not have at this time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. Three vessel disease diagnosed by catheterization in [**2177-7-7**].
3. Complete heart block status post pacer placement.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Prostate cancer.
6. Depression.
7. Mild dementia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
2. Lipitor 10 mg po q day.
3. Ambien 5 mg po q day.
4. Aricept 10 mg po q day.
5. Protonix 40 mg po q day.
6. Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day.
7. Lisinopril 2.5 mg po q day.
8. Lasix 20 mg po q day.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  106/52, 70, 16,
and 98% on 2 liters.  General appearance:  Pale appearing
thin male in no apparent distress, slightly anxious.  HEENT:
Extraocular movements are intact.  No sublingual or scleral
icterus.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx is clear.
Neck:  Jugular venous distention 1 cm below the earlobe, no
carotid bruits.  Cardiac:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, distant
positive S3 at the apex.  Pulmonary:  Bilaterally clear to
auscultation, distant.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, and obese.  Extremities:  No cyanosis or
clubbing, positive pitting edema extending up the calf.
Multiple scratches and small lesions on both legs.  Pulses
were not palpable secondary to edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 4.8, hematocrit 36.3,
and platelets 183.  Electrolytes:  Sodium 143, potassium 4.9,
chloride 106, bicarbonate 26, BUN 35, creatinine 1.5, and
glucose 87.  Patient's digoxin level was 1.0.  His initial
troponin was 34.1 with a CK of 144 and CK MB of 5.

Given the above, the patient was taken for high risk cardiac
catheterization, which showed left main and two vessel
coronary artery disease, severe systolic ventricular
dysfunction, moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction,
successful stenting of the mid left anterior descending
artery, successful angioplasty rescue of jailed diagonal-1
branch.  Successful placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump
for stabilization prior to left anterior descending artery
intervention.

The patient was at this time, transferred to the CCU where he
was observed until stable.  The Cardiothoracic surgeons were
consulted regarding any possible surgical intervention,
however, they felt the patient was not a good surgical
candidate.  Therefore, the patient proceeded with a high risk
catheterization and left anterior descending artery
intervention.

He was transferred back to the floor, where he remains
stable, and was eventually discharged

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day.
2. Aldactone 12.5 mg po q day.
3. Lisinopril 5 mg po q day.
4. Toprol XL 25 mg po q day.
5. Aspirin 325 mg po q day.
6. Plavix 75 mg po q day.

SERVICES:  The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy, and was discharged to home with VNA
services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Congestive heart failure.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency.
4. Prostate cancer.
5. Complete heart block.
