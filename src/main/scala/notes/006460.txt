Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Brachial Plexus Radiation (2 sessions)


History of Present Illness:
63 YO F with metastatic adenocarcinoma, likely from a NSCLC
primary, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**3-29**] with her wife after
experiencing increasing somnolence for two days and difficult
breathing since the evening prior to admission. As her mental
status was depressed at the time of initial interview, most of
the following history was obtained from the chart and from the
pt's wife.
.
Earlier in the week the pt had been doing well, conversing
appropriately and attending medical appointments without
difficulty. On Wednesday, [**2188-3-26**], the pt was initiated on her
first cycle of palliative chemotherapy with
carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab. The following day, [**2188-3-27**],
she also received Zometa and Neulasta. Around this time, the pt
endorsed some low-grade temperatures, between 100.0 and 100.3.
These subsequently resolved. She then went on to develop the
mental status changes and difficulty breathing described above.
The pt's wife noted that when she would attempt to administer
the pt her medications, she would awake to take them but then
fall asleep before they could even be given. The pt has not had
any recent change in her medications. She has not been noted to
be nauseated or to vomit. She has not complained of any urinary
symptoms. No focal abnormal movements or weakness have been
noted. Her pain has remained under fair control. Due to her pain
and limited weight bearing, the pt has limited mobility at home,
spending much time in bed or in a wheelchair.
.
The patient presented with detailed information concerning her
end of life wishes, including the fact that she is DNR and DNI.
The patient's wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1727**], is the her next of [**Doctor First Name **]. ABG
analysis was offered to the patient her spouse in the [**Name (NI) **] and
declined.
.
In the ED, intial vitals were 98.2, 124, 16, 88% RA, 111/76. At
the time of the ED physician examination, she was noted to
desaturate as low as the high 60s on RA. The pt was felt to be
in congestive failure. She was treated with IV Lasix and
morphine. As she remained confused and intermittently agitated,
she was also given Haldol, to which she had a good response. She
was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for ongoing medical managment and
intensive nursing care.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic history:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63-year-old white woman with a prior
25-pack-year history of smoking who presented in [**11/2187**] with
evidence of bone and musculoskeletal discomfort. Further
progression of her symptoms led to imaging studies in early
[**1-/2188**] that confirmed evidence of widespread disseminated bone
metastasis. Most of the lesions predominated in her hip bones
and her cervical and thoracic spine. The patient was
significantly symptomatic from these lesions with pain and mild
neurological impairment. It seems based on all imaging studies
that she did not have evidence of overt spinal cord compression.
The remaining of her radiographic imaging studies also showed a
left upper lobe and left hilar lesion in the lung.
.
Due to the patient's symptoms, she was started on palliative
radiation without a diagnosis. She received and completed [**2178**]
cGy of radiation to her right hemipelvis, sacrum, and L5 with
concurrent dexamethasone steroid therapy. Unfortunately, shortly
after completing the initial palliative radiation, the patient
developed upper left extremity neurologic complaints that
prompted initiation of palliative radiation therapy to the C6 to
T5 spine. The patient completed [**2178**] cGy, but contiues to have
pain and left arm/hand weakness.
.
The final pathology of her [**2188-3-5**] bone biopsy disclosed a
carcinoma (likely adenocarcinoma) with the following IHC
profile: positive for CK7 and mammoglobin. Negative stains
include, CK20, TTF-1, GCDFP, ER, PR and HER2 (FISH for HER2 is
pending). Based on all the available radiographic and pathologic
data, it is suspected that the patient has a stage IV carcinoma
that likely represents nonsmall cell lung cancer. The
mammoglobin positive stain (that can he highly specific for
breast cancer), the very high CEA and CA [**05**],29 have been viewed
as perplexing, and are thought to suggest that any therapy for
her carcinoma should at least use some active agents against
breast cancer. The lack of ER/PR staining makes hormone therapy
not an option.
.
PMH:
*extensive skeletal metastises with resultant left upper and
lower extremity weakness, pathologic fracture of right
acetabulum, presumed spinal instability
*s/p XRT to sacrum and pelvis, C6 and T5
*osteoporosis
*prior premalignant oral lesions in both her buccal mucosa and
the floor of the mouth, treated with topical ablations >10 years
ago
depression
*GERD
*allergic rhitis
*prior laparotomy for lysis of adhesions after IUD associated
pelvic inflammatory disease


Social History:
Smoked 1.5 ppd x 21 years. Minimal EtOH. No significant
exposures. Faculty member in family medicine at [**University/College 6022**].

Family History:
The patient's mother died from gastric cancer at age 38. The
patient has a first cousin that had a history of breast cancer
before age 60. The patient's father died at age 80 from
complications of heart disease. There are no other members of
the family that have history of cancer.

[**2188-3-29**] TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. There appears to be a
left pleural
