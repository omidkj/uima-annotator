Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Change in MS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80-year-old man w/ hypertension, anxiety,
ulcerative colitis, diverticulosis w/ recent GI bleeding, recent
NSTEMI, and dementia recently started on Exelon, who presents
today for evaluation of an episode of unresponsiveness. The pt
was in his USOH until about noon today at his NH when he became
unresponsive. VS at the time: Temp 96.8F, HR 68, R 20, BP 78/50,
FSBS 105. He was responsive only to painful stimuli. He was
transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital, where his BP was 94/66. He
continued to be unresponsive on transfer but his
unresponsiveness resolved spontaneously (total time approx 20
minutes). He had a negative Head CT, but was noted to have an
elevated Troponin to 0.11. He became agitated and received 0.5mg
Ativan, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up. On
arrival in the ED, VS - Temp 97.3F, HR 70, BP 92/56, R 12,
O2-sat 100% RA. In the ED repeat troponin was .06. EKG showed
t-wave inversions in I, II, and V3-V6. Cards was consulted and
"code STEMI" was called, but cardiology thought it wasn't
indicated because ST changes were non-pathologic. Pt was given
1500cc of fluid and admitted to the MICU for hypotension with
SBPs in the 80s.


Past Medical History:
Diverticulosis s/p recent bleed (treated at [**Location (un) 620**]), and a
prior bleed in [**2188**]
Ulcerative colitis
Hypertension
Dementia
Osteoarthritis
Status post hip replacement in [**2188-2-20**]
Anxiety


Social History:
Lives at a nursing home, which he was sent to after his last
hospitalization for NSTEMI (in [**5-30**]). Since then he has had a
more rapid decline in his functional status and he now requires
a wheel chair. He is somewhat forgetful. Diet: Dysphagia
mechanical soft w/ Honey thick liquids

CXR FINDINGS:

There is stable cardiomegaly. There is minimal blunting of the
left
costophrenic angle. There are multiple gas-filled loops of bowel
seen in the upper abdomen, likely unchanged since the prior
examination. There are no focal consolidations. Mild edema is
appreciated.
CONCLUSION:
Stable cardiomegaly with mild edema. No pneumonia seen.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


ECG: EKG: NSR at 60bpm, LAD, IVCD, <1mm ST elevations in V1-V3,
<1mm Q waves in V1-V3, <1mm ST depressions in V5-V6, TWI in I,
II, and V3-V6. All new from prior in [**5-30**].

CAROTID DOPPLER: FINDINGS: The carotid arteries are tortuous,
which makes evaluation more
difficult. There is mild intimal thickening, consistent with
atherosclerotic
plaque formation noticed involving the ICA bilaterally. However,
there is no
significant ICA stenosis noticed on either side, and no evidence
of
significantly altered flow dynamics. The following peak systolic
flow
velocities were obtained in m/sec.

RIGHT SIDE: CCA 0.56, proximal ICA 0.73, mid ICA 0.49 and distal
ICA 0.45.

LEFT SIDE: CCA 0.81, proximal ICA 0.4, mid ICA 0.4 and distal
ICA 0.55.

The ICA/CCA ratios are 1.3 on the right and 0.67 on the left.
There was
antegrade flow recorded in both vertebral arteries.

IMPRESSION:
1. No significant ICA stenosis on either side.
2. Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: This exam is slighlty limited by motion.
There is no hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline
structures or evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
Hypodensities in the periventricular and subcortical white
matter reflects chronic microvascular ischemic change. The
ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related
involutional change. The cavernous carotids and left vertebral
artery are densely calcified. The visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells remain normally aerated.

IMPRESSION: Exam is slightly limited by motion. There is no
acute
intracranial process. If there is concern regarding ischemia
then MRI with diffusion- weighted imaging is more sensitive.

ECHO:The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated LV with severe left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Dilated and hypokinetic RV. At least moderate
mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-5-24**], the
lV is now dilated and global LV systolic dysfunction has
worsened - the basal segments had reasonable function on prior
but are now moderate to severely hypokinetic. The right
ventricle is now dilated and hypokinetic. The degree of mitral
regurgitation has increased.
