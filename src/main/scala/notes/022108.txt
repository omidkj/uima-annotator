RADIOLOGY   Preliminary Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2165-3-13**] 10:37 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with s/p avr, mvrepair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Follow up of a patient after aortic and
mitral valve repair.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to [**3-10**], [**2165**] and [**2165-3-9**].

The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal
of the Swan-Ganz catheter, NG tube, and mediastinal drains. The
moderate cardiomegaly is stable. The post-sternotomy wires are
unremarkable. The replaced aortic valve appears in the expected
location. Bilateral pleural effusions are present, left more
than right, moderate on the right with no evidence of
pneumothorax. The upper lungs are clear with no evidence of
failure. The lungs are generally hyperinflated, findings
consistent with small airway disease such as COPD.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. Bilateral
pleural effusions and atelectasis, improved since the previous
study. Expected appearance of the post-sternotomy wires and
replaced aortic valve.

Lung hyperinflation.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2).

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 45 - 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Post-CPB: Patient is AV-Paced, on low dose Neo.
A well-seated and functioning prosthetic aortic valve is seen.
No leak. No AI. [**Pager number 76743**] PG=16, mean =7.
A mitral ring is seen. No MR. [**First Name (Titles) 76743**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]=4.
2+ TR remains.
Good biventricular systolic fxn. Aorta intact.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**3-7**] for heparinization and on
[**2165-3-8**] she underwent an AVR(19mm pericardial)/MV repair(26mm
annuloplasty band).  The cross clamp time was 91 mins and total
bypass tiem was 110 mins.  She tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the CVICU on Neo and Propofol in stable
condition.  She was extubated on POD#2 and had her chest tubes
d/c'd.  She had a fib and was started on Amio and cardioverted
into SR. She improved and was transferred to the floor on POD#3.
Her amio was dc'd and she was restarted on her home sotatol. Her
wires were d/c'd on POD#4. She was ready for discharge home on
POD #6.
