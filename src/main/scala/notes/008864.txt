Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of severe COPD on home
oxygen(4L), diastolic heart failure, and kyphoscoliosis who
presented to the [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital with increasing shortness of
breath the evening prior to admission. She was being treated at
her [**Hospital3 **] for heart failure exacerbation, however she
had an aspiration event in the dining room at dinner, desatted
to low 80s on 4liters, tachycardic prompting transfer to the ED.
There she was febrile to 102 and felt to have active acute on
chronic diastolic heart failure, copd flare, and pneumonia. She
also complained of chest pain, but details are unclear. She
received vanco/solumedrol/lasix and ntg paste at OSH prior to ED
to [**Hospital **] transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management at the request of
the family. On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], her room air sat was in the 80s
and she was tachypnic to 40s. She was started on bipap and
received cefepime and gentamycin and blood cultures were sent.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 102.2 HR 96afib BP 136/74 RR 26
POx 87. Prior to transfer to the floor HR 98 BP 135/71. Her IV
infiltrated and was removed. She was given 1gm Vanc, 125mg
solumedrol, and nitropaste at [**Last Name (un) 4199**] for SOB and ? chest pain.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED

On the floor, she is comfortable on BiPAP, satting 92% on FiO2
30%, but does not remember what happened at dinner the previous
night.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with severe COPD, diastolic heart failure,
kyphoscoliosis who presents with acute on chronic diastolic
heart failure and aspiration pneumonia.

# Hypoxia - Presented with aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and
component of acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
Underlying COPD, kyphoscoliosis contributing.  ABG with baseline
hypercarbia of PCO2 76.  Presented with lactate of 2.1, but down
to 1.7 after 1 L NS resuscitation. She was maintained at first
on Bipap with sats >92% so was then weaned to NC with sats in
the low 90s for most of the first hospital day. When she fell
asleep she did require CPAP with PS using full face mask set at
IPAP of 15 and EPAP of 5 with 2-4L oxygen to maintain oxygen
sats of 88-92%. She was started on vanc/zosyn on [**2196-5-5**] for
HCAP given that she lives in a [**Hospital3 **] and has had
multiple recent hospital admission and her CXR had evidence of
RLL infiltrate. She will complete an 10 day course on [**2196-5-15**].
She was maintained on her home dose of lasix which was increased
the day of admission (she takes 80mg PO at home and got 40mg IV
here) for goal fluid balance net negative 500mL daily.

# ECG changes:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital 4199**] hospital ED, patient was complaining
of chest pain and given nitro paste. Cardiac biomarkers were
flat (0.04->0.02), EKG in am was unchanged. She was started on
asa while awaiting results of ROMI. She had no further episodes
of chest pain and her cardiac enzymes were negative. Aspirin was
continued in place of coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.

# COPD on home O2 (3-4L at baseline): On admission bicarb was at
her baseline and her hypercarbia was at baseline with PCO2 of
76. Also was on prednisone for recent exacerbation and was given
125mg solumedrol at [**Hospital 4199**] hospital.  Kept O2 sats 89-92.
Received scheduled Nebs and PRN for SOB. Continued prednisone
20mg which should be tapered as she continues to improve. ABx as
above.

# A fib on coumadin: She had a sub therapeutic INR of 1.7 on
admission with good rate control with Cardizem and metoprolol.
She was switched to short acting dilt while hospitalized with
HRs in low 60s and switched back at the time of discharge. She
was continued on metoprolol for rate control. Given the
risk/benefit of coumadin in this patient, decision was made to
treat with aspirin alone.

# Acute on chronic Diastolic heart failure: ECHO from [**10/2195**]
showed EF of 70-80% with Mild PAH and significant pulmonic
regurg.  On admission appeared euvolemic.  She was given 1 L NS
in ED for lactate of 2.1 which improved to 1.7 after fluids. BNP
was mildly elevated at level it had been on past admissions. Her
CXR did not appear grossly fluid overloaded so lasix was
initially held but as above over the day she had some increasing
O2 requirements and she was given her recently increased home
dose of lasix. We recommend continuing with daily weights,
maitain goal I/O at negative 500cc /day, titrating lasix and
monitoring electrolytes as necessary.

# Chronic Aspiration - Patient should be maintain on aspiration
precautions and dysphagia diet of pureed solids and nectar
thickened liquids. The risk of future aspiration events
discussed with patient's family. It is their wish to continue
with feeding.

# Goals of Care - Family very interested in initiating
palliative care/home hospice when the time comes for her to
transition home and would like more information on this.

# hyperglycemia - In setting of steroids patient was noted to
have elevated blood sugars. A humalog sliding scale was started.

# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin and H2 blocker
# Access: peripherals
# Code: DNR/DNI per family and nursing home records
