History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11622**] is a 27 year old man with h/o Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome,
chronic obstructive/restrictive lung disease on home O2 4LNC, on
nighttime vent with trach, admitted with worsening SOB, DOE and
increased secretions.

The patient noted worsening DOE several days prior to admission,
increasing secretions, and had increased his daytime O2
requirement from 4LNC to 5LNC. He is chronically on Prednisone,
has a trach in place, and uses a vent every night. No F/C, CP,
N/V. Of note, the pt is sedentary at baseline [**3-15**] to his
syndrome and is on chronic methadone and other pain medications
for bone pain associated with the syndrome. He reports he has
had multiple pneumonias in the past, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] ~6
weeks ago with a Pseudomonas VAP.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.6 P 106 BP 137/93 R 28 O2 sat
100%. CXR was difficult to interpret, so the patient had a CTA -
there was no e/o PE, but a LLL opacity was noted. The patient
was given Levaquin and Ceftriaxone. He was noted to desat to 85%
once while asleep, but improved when he was awakened. Prior to
transfer, vitals: P 93 BP 135/106 RR 21 O2sat 100% on 35% trach
mask.

On the floor, pt is trached and vented. He admits to some R
sided CP when he breathes. Denies chills, NS, weight loss,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Has had sinus congestion and
tenderness under his eyes over the past week.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fevers, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache.  Denies chest pressure, palpitations, or
weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria,
frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies
rashes or skin changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11622**] is a 27 year old man with h/o Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome,
chronic obstructive/restrictive lung disease on home O2 4LNC, on
nighttime vent with trach, admitted with worsening SOB, DOE and
increased secretions, found to have LLL opacity on CTA, c/w VAP.

#. Increased respiratory distress: Patient was assumed to have a
ventilator associated pneumonia, given low grade temps during
admission, increased shortness of breath, secretions, pleuritic
chest pain and leukocytosis with L shift in the setting of a
pseudomonal pneumonia several weeks ago.  The CTA performed in
the ED was negative for PE and showed a consolidation in the LLL
most likely c/w pneumonia. There was a suggestion of chronic
atelectasis in that portion of the lung on a read from an old CT
from [**Hospital1 2025**], however not having seen that scan, and given the
severity of Mr. [**Known lastname 86060**] underlying lung disease and lack of any
pulmonary reserve, we chose to initiate treatment. He was
started on Vanc/Zosyn/Ciprofloxacin for VAP coverage on arrival
to the ICU.  Sputum cultures were sent and contaminated.  Vanc
and cefepime were chosen for a 14 day outpatient course after
looking at the sensitivites of prior sputum cx from [**Hospital1 2025**].

Of note, chest CT did suggest some component of pulmonary edema
as contributing to the new respiratory difficulties.  He was
diuresed overnight with overall general improvement.  An echo
was unable to visualize the right heart well, unfortunately.  EF
was >55%.  Based upon clinical suspicion, the pt was started on
lasix 10 mg po daily.

In addition to the above, the pt was continued on his home vent
settings, inhalers and prednisone.  Over the course of several
days in the ICU, the patients respiratory status stabilized and
prior to d/c he felt his breathing was significantly better and
approaching baseline.

#. Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome: Rare connective tissue disorder and
osteolytic syndrome, with characteristic facies, skull
deformities, osteoporosis, joint laxity, short stature,
dissolution of distal phalanges. Pt has considerable bone pain
as a result. Continue home pain medications including methadone,
baclofen, gabapentin, and morphine.

# Smoking cessation: Pt encouraged to discontinue smoking.
Offered nicotine patch in house.

# Disposition: given the patients significant family support at
home and his own understanding about his disease, we felt that
he was safe to be discharged home with a PICC line.  VNA to
administer IV abx.

# Immunizations: Pt received Pneumovax during this
hospitalization. Reports last Pneumovax prior to this was about
5 years prior.
