Hyponatremia

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with a PMH significant for
CAD s/p PCI, HTN, and HLD admitted for hyponatremia. The patient
and her daughters report that she has had decreased PO intake
over the past week, and yesterday developed nausea and vomiting.
Her daughters further state that she was admitted to NEBH one
month prior for "dehydration," but she did not have a low
sodiuum level at that time. They further state that since her
discharge, she has had an acute decline in her memory and
ability to function independently, and is currently living at
home with her husband under 24 hour nursing care.  She denies
any f/c/s, diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath, HA,
palpitations, orthopnea, LE edema, or PND. The patient does
report a periumbilicar abomdinal pain, which her daughters state
has been going on for years.  Her daughters also state that she
has had no recent medication changes.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 77 115/55 20 100%RA.  A CXR and UA
was negative. A CTAP demonstrated a 7 mm celiac aneurysm, for
which vascular surgery was consulted in the ED with
recommendation for no acute intervention at this time. The
patient was then admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is resting comfortably without
complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old female with a PMH significant for
CAD s/p PCI, HTN, and HLD admitted for hyponatremia.

# Hyponatremia: The patient was admitted with a serum sodium of
113, but without seizure activity or evidence of coma,
suggesting that patient's sodium decreased slowly over time.
However her mental status was not at baseline, very likely [**12-29**]
delirium in the setting of hyponatremia.  Her thiazide diuretic
was held, as this was likely contributing to hyponatremia.  On
admission, she was noted to be hypovolemic and her sodium
improved some with normal saline.  However, her sodium started
to decrease with continued normal saline infusion.  Urine and
serum lytes were rechecked and in the setting of euvolemia, her
hyponatremia was thought most likely to be due to SIADH (urine
osm >400, serum Na <120 and serum osms low, and urine Na
inappropriately high).  CT head and chest were done to eval for
malignancy for etiology of SIADH, no masses were noted.  She was
treated with free water restriction and TID salt tabs, as
recommended by the nephrology service.  On discharge she will
continue to take salt tabs and have her Na monitored as an
outpatient.  Na on discharge 132.  She will f/u with PCP for
another [**Name9 (PRE) **] check on [**12-7**].  She should probably not restart a
thiazide diuretic in the future.

#Altered mental status: likely has baseline dementia that
initially was slowly progressing but acutely worsened after
being hospitalized in [**Month (only) **].  Has 24 hr nursing care at home.
 During admission initially, was frequently not oriented to
place or location, or why she was in the hospital and often saw
people and things that were not actually present, with both
auditory and visual hallucinations.  Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course
suggested delirium in the setting of her hyponatremia vs
worsening dementia.  On discharge, mental status at baseline per
family, unable to do months of the year backwards but AOx3 and
no hallucinations.  continued home aricept.

# HTN: Her hydrochlorothiazide was held as above.  She was
continued on valsartan at 160 mg [**Hospital1 **], which is her home dose.
She was also continued on isosorbide mononitrate.  SBP was still
elevated to 140s-160s, so amlodipine 5 mg daliy was started for
improved BP control.

# ?Celiac aneurysm: Initially CT Abd/pelvis showed concern for
celiac artery aneursym, however final CTA read ectatic celiac
artery without aneurysm.

# Elevated lipase: Unclear significance with no radiographic
evidence of pancreatic and benign abdominal exam.  Also had CTA
abd/pelvis without evidence of pancreatitis.

# CAD s/p PCI: She was continued on ASA, valsartan, and
clopidogrel.

# DM 2: HISS with accuchecks, continued home metformin on
discharge.

# HLD: Vytorin continued on discharge.
