Pertinent Results:
MRA head and neck:
1. Evidence of atherosclerotic disease, with mild- moderate
stenosis
involving the proximal internal and external carotid arteries,
at their
origins origin on the left side as well as stenosis of petrous
carotids, on both sides, right more than left. No flow
limitation. Several short segments of stenosis are not
adequately assessed on the present study.
.
MRI head:
1. No evidence of acute infarction.
2. A 1.5 x 1.0 cm focal lesion, corresponding to abnormality
noted on the CT, it could represent meningioma. This is located
in the falx at the vertex. However, assessment is limited due to
lack of IV contrast.
3. Patent major intracranial arteries with no focal
flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm more than 3 mm
within the resolution of MR angiogram
.
EEG
Normal portable EEG in wakefulness. The background rhythm
appeared normal, and there were no areas of persistent focal
slowing or any epileptiform features. An abnormal cardiac rhythm
was noted.
.
Carotid dopplers:
PENDING
.
CSF: Protein-79/ glucose-59/ 1WBC/ 2RBC/ gram stain negative
.
Blood, urine, CSF cultures NGTD
.
CXR:
Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. Increase in perihilar vascular
engorgement and bilateral increase in the interstitial markings
compared to the prior studies are consistent with worsening
pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be
excluded. There is no pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with acute mental status changes in the
setting of fevers.  Her admission chest XR was not convincing
for PNA, and all other culture data unrevealing. However on
hospital day #2 she developed more obvious aphasia.  A full
neurological work-up was done including MRA of the head and
neck, MRI of the brain, EEG, carotid dopplers, and and LP, none
of which revealed any acute causes for her aphasia.  Her
symptoms resolved on their own, and upon further discussion with
her family it seems as though her past TIA was consistent with
this type of presentation.  Neurology was consulted and believed
this was c/w a toxic metabolic encephalopathy.  Pt became
afebrile and delerium cleared, without use of antibiotics.  Her
course was complicated by AF with RVR which resolved and
remained stable on her home doses of beta blocker.
