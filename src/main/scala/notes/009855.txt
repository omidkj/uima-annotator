Intubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 54 yo M with h/o HCV, hepatocellular ca, cirrhosis, ascites
who has been living in a nursing home transitioning to hospice.
Plan was for patient to go back to [**Country 4812**] where he would
likely die soon. Instructions were that he wanted to remain full
code in hopes that he would be able to make it back to [**Country 4812**].
On DOA pt was noted to have MS changes and was sent to ED. On
arrival he was noted to have sBP in 60's and was started on
levophed and bolused with IVF. Lactate was 10.6. ECG showed
peaked t waves and K was 6.8. An NG tube was placed to give him
kayexalate and coffee ground material was aspirated. He was
given IV protonix, vanco, levofloxacin, flagyl and albumin in
the ED. LFT's were c/w cholangitis and RUQ U/S showed no
significant change from prior exam. Surgery was consulted but
felt that pt was not a surgical candidate given comorbidities
and overall dismal prognosis. This was communicated to the
patients friends who accompanied him in the [**Name (NI) **], but they felt
uncomfortable changing his code status. His brother is flying to
[**Name (NI) 86**] from [**Country 4812**] and the wish was expressed that the patient
be supported fully, including intubation if necessary, until his
brother arrives tomorrow ([**6-17**]).

Pertinent Results:
Labs:
Notable for lactate 10.6, WBC 13.3, K 6.8, T. bili 18.5, INR 2.1
.
Studies:
CXR ([**2181-6-16**]) 6:49 p.m.: There are multiple new ill-defined
patchy opacities throughout both lungs, perihilar haze, and an
effaced right diaphragmatic border.  This is secondary to
multifocal pneumonia, asymmetric pulmonary edema, or
combination. A small right pleural effusion is also present.
The cardiac size continues to be normal, and the mediastinal
contours are normal. An NG tube is located in
the stomach. IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia, asymmetric
pulmonary edema, or combination.
.
CXR (5/13/06)7:57 p.m.: In the one hour interval, a right
internal jugular central venous catheter has been placed with
the tip projecting over the cavoatrial junction. There is no
evidence for pneumothorax.  Opacification of both lungs appears
to be worsening. IMPRESSION: Worsening bilateral opacification
with new central venous line provjecting over cavoatrial
junction.
.
RUQ U/S ([**2181-6-16**]) - prelim read:
1. Portal vein thrombosis with apparent cavernous
transformation.  Unchanged compared to prior examination of [**4-17**], [**2181**].
2. Heterogeneous right liver lobe lesions consistent with HCC.
3. Minimal amount of ascites.
4. Gallbladder wall thickening with no evidence of acute
cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 54 yo M with h/o HCV, hepatocellular ca, cirrhosis, ascites
who presents with sepsis, hyperkalemia and ARF.
.
# septic shock: The patient was admitted with concern for septic
shock of a cholagitis or lung origin.  BP remained low.
Pressers were eventually weaned down and off for a short period
of time and then eventually were restarted.
.
# hypotension: Pt's BP at presentation was 70s/palp.
Differentials include sepsis, 3rd space fluid shift resulting
from hypoalbuminemia; less likely from GI bleed.  BP increased
over subsequent days and pressors were decreased.
.
# hypoxemia: Pt was initially hypoxemic - this then resolved.
.
# MS changes: The pt was unresponsive off sedation, likely due
to hepatic encephalopathy but intracranial process is another
possibility.
.
# GI bleed: Pt reported to have coffee-ground material from NG
aspirate.  Pt has known cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis
which has likely resulted in the development of porto-caval
anastomosis and varices.  Of note, pt had EGD in [**4-9**] which did
not show any evidence of varices.
.
# ARF: Creatinine was 4.2 at presentation; baseline <1.0.  This
improved with hydration.
.
# ?ST depression: there was no CE elevation
.
# coagulopathy: INR elevated to 2.1 - likely due to liver
failure. Pt got vitamin K but coagulopathy worsened.
Eventually, he began bleeding profusely and could not be
resucitated effectively and care was withdrawn (see below).
.
# HCC: Pt has a large liver mass and elevated alpha-fetoprotein.
Patient is not a candidate for surgery or transplant due to the
size of his mass, and the presence of cirrhosis and portal
venous involvement. Not a candidate for chemotherapy given poor
performance status. This was the underlying cause of his
worsening status over this hospital stay.
.
The patient was treated supportively.  Though his ARF improved,
his mental status did not, nor did his liver function.  On the
final day of hospitalization he developed bleeding from the ETT,
line site, and HCT dropped.  He became tachycardic, hypotensive,
and remained unresponsive.  His brother was notified of his
status change and, despite efforts to resuscitate his blood
volume, he remianed hypotensive.  His brother was [**Name (NI) 653**] and
agreed with withdrawal of resuscitative measures and focus on
comfort.  The ETT was withdrawn and the patient developed
cardiopulmonary failure within 15 minutes.  He died at 11:05 pm
on [**2181-6-21**].
