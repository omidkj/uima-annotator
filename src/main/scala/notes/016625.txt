Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for dyspnea, bradycardia, [**Last Name (un) **] and hyperkalemia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
46 year old female with history of Down Syndrome, repaired ASD,
and severe right sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension
with prior admissions for acute exacerbations for volume
overload was transferred from OSH for dyspnea, bradycardia, [**Last Name (un) **]
and hyperkalemia.
.
According to patient's sister, at 12pm on [**9-20**], patient had
acute drop in her urine output.  During the course of entire day
she had only put out 100ml. She increased her fluid intake by
few hundred mls without any corresponding increase in urine
outpt.  Patient has been on 3L home O2 for low O2 sats for the
past 2 years.  However yesertday patient felt more tired and
tachypneic wtih drop in O2 sat to 89% therefore her sister
increased O2 to 4L.  Her baseline weight is around 160-162.
Yesterday her weight was 164-165.  Last night [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
noted heart rate in the 30-40s, temperature of 94 and therefore
EMS was called.  She was found to be in junctional rythm by EMS
(no strips available) and received 0.5mgx2 of atropine with HR
increaing to 40s.  At OSH, her CXR was suspicious for pneumonia
and CHF, and she was given both Levofloxacin 750 mg and
Furosemide 80 mg IV prior to transfer. Foley was placed and per
sister patient put out 1L of urine.  While en route, OSH called
to report that her labs showed K 8.1 and Na 116. (Of note
patient takes 60meq of potassium at home on daily basis).
.
Initial vitals in ED triage were T 97.3, HR 68, BP 102/56, RR
28, and SpO2 100%.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was comfortable with
NSR 70s.  She reported sore throat, coughing, vague chest pain,
and abdominal pain.  EKG showed NSR with RBBB and no peaked T
waves.  CXR showed severe cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary
edema.
.
Her hyperkalemia was treated with Dextrose 25 grams, Insulin 5
units IV, and Calcium gluconate 2 grams IV.  She was started on
Furosemide drip at 5 mg/hr for her CHF.  She was admitted to the
CCU for further management of her CHF and multiple electrolyte
abnormalities.

On the floor she reports epigastric and RUQ abdominal pain.  She
had taken 4 over the counter aleve tablet for her pain in the
past few days.  She also had 4 episodes of watery bowel
movements yesterday along with nausea.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

TTE: [**2121-9-22**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is [**6-12**]
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall
hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2119-8-14**],
the findings are similar.
.
CXR: [**2121-9-21**]
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Severe cardiomegaly and
mediastinal vascular engorgement is noted.  Bilateral hazy
opacities in both lung fields, consistent with moderate to
severe pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusions or
pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Severe cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema.
.
Abdominal Ultrasound: [**2121-9-22**]
FINDINGS:  The liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities.
The
gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones.  The common
bile duct is not dilated. The main portal vein is patent with
hepatopetal flow and a
normal-appearing waveform.  There is no ascites. Both right and
left kidneys are normal without evidence of hydronephrosis or
stones.  Previously appreciated right upper pole parapelvic
cysts are not appreciated on today's exam.  The right kidney
measures 9.6 cm, the left kidney measures 10.7 cm. The head and
body of the pancreas are unremarkable.  The tail of the pancreas
is not well visualized due to bowel gas.  The
