CT Neck [**5-14**]:
1. No fluid collections or abscesses are identified within the
neck. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.
2. Endotracheal tube cuff appears slightly overdistended, with
no adjacent pneumomediastinum.
3. Bilateral hypodense thyroid nodules, with scattered coarse
calcifications are likely benign. Thyroid ultrasound could be
performed on a nonemergent basis if clinically indicated.
.
CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**5-14**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, as clinically questioned.
Enlarged pulmonary artery, compatible with pulmonary arterial
hypertension.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent airspace disease,
likely representing atelectasis.
3. Findings consistent with cirrhosis with associated
splenomegaly likely reflecting portal hypertension.
.
CT Head [**5-14**]:
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
CXR [**5-14**]:
1. Recommend pulling the endotracheal tube at least 2 cm back.
2. Increased density of the retrocardiac space could represent
atelectasis versus underlying hiatal hernia. Clinical
correlation recommended.
.
CXR [**5-16**]:
Probable worsening of bilateral pleural effusions with new left
lower lobe opacity. Given rapidity of onset atelectasis or
aspiration pneumonitis is favored over rapid developing
pneumonia.
.
Renal US [**5-17**]:
Unremarkable evaluation of bilateral kidneys without evidence
for hydronephrosis, obstructing stone or renal mass.
.
KUB [**5-18**]:
Ascites with retained oral contrast in the distal colon and
rectum. No contrast seen corresponding to renal fossae or course
of ureters.
.
X-ray of Right shoulder ([**2137-5-19**]
FINDINGS: There is no fracture or dislocation. The glenohumeral
and acromioclavicular joints are within normal limits. The
coracoclavicular interval is appropriate. The regional soft
tissues radiographically are unremarkable. The visualized
adjacent lung is clear.
.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of traumatic bony injury to
the shoulder. Please note, not mentioned above, there are very
tiny curvilinear opacities in the region of the greater
tuberosity which are likely due to calcific tendinitis and are
not felt to be due to acute trauma.
.
ECG [**2137-5-19**]: sinus at 80, nl intervals and axis, no ST/T wave
changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan: Pt is a 46 yo woman hep C, splenomegaly &
pancytopenia of unclear etiology, depression/anxiety, hx
prescription narcotic abuse who p/w acute mental status changes
intubated. She was successfully extubated on HD 2 and then
developed acute renal failure (likely contrast induced
nephropathy).

1. Altered mental status/delirium/possible benzodiazepine
overdose - Unclear etiology for this. Toxicology screen at OSH
was not done and here only positive for opiates (she was given
then in ED)She was initially intubated for airway protection,
and successfully extubated on HD#2. Pt was initially thought to
have meningitis, though an LP could not be performed. She was
initially treated with meningeal dosing abx (vancomycin and
ceftriaxone). However, exam did not support meningitis and upon
review on OMR records, patient has a history of neck pain
(tension headache). Her altered mental status was thought to
possibly be toxic metabolic in etiology or hepatic
encephalopathy secondary to her underlying cirrhosis (elevated
ammonia level on admission). Another concern was TTP in the
setting of mental status changes, renal failure, anemia, and
thrombocytopenia (see below). However, heme-onc saw pt and felt
that this was unlikely secondary to smear.  EEG showed
nonspecific mild encephalopathy.

Lactulose was started po. Panculture was negative for infection.
Additionally, question of withdrawing from substances
(clonazepam, antispasmotics, other drugs) are more likely as on
the day of the call out, pt was found to have bottles of
clonipin under her pillows; although she denies taking the
pills, she appeared very sedated and the bottles were filled on
[**2137-5-14**] (same day she was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**]), prescribed at
[**Hospital **] Hospital. Called the pharmacy who filled the
presciption [**Telephone/Fax (3) 57986**], unable to read the signature of the
prescription as it was a hand written prescription.  Called
[**Hospital **] hospital and on call psychiatrist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**Telephone/Fax (3) 57987**]), pt was admitted briefly (1-2 days) for GI symptoms
thought to be pancreatitis at [**Hospital1 **], and was discharged on
clonipin (2mg PO bid) as this was her outpatient medications by
one of the interns on the floor.  Because of her sedation,
benzos and dilaudid were discontinued (she was briefly kept on
CIWA scale).  Psychiatry evaluated pt, and recommended seroquel
25mg PO tid for agitation and anxiety, and continue haldol prn
for agitation.  She became more alert and less sedated after
above regimen.  Physical therapy and occupational therapy worked
with the patient, and she did well, and cleared her t
