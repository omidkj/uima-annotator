Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Known firstname 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
anemia/CP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of percutaneous nephrostomy tube, placement of stent
in right ureter.


History of Present Illness:
69 year-old gentleman with Bladder cancer (dx in [**10-20**], s/p
radical cystectomy, left nephrectomy, currently with right
urostomy tube), who was scheduled to receive a nephrostomy tube
placed at IR yesterday as an outpatient for worsening
obstructive uropathy and renal failure, but was found to be too
anemic (22) and instead was sent for an elective transfusion
today at IR daycare unit. Today, about 15 minutes into the
transfusion, he felt nauseated and experienced chest discomfort
, and so was referred to the ED. The CP was [**2-21**], lasted for a
few minutes, and did not radiate. No SOB, rash, or fever.

In the ED, intial VS: 98.5 56 147/77 16 99%. He was CP free in
the ER. Also c/o RLQ pain above urostomy site. On exam found to
have a palpable mass in that area. EKG showed sinus brady at
55bpm with no ischemic changes with possible peaked T waves.
Labs were significant for acute on chronic renal failure (cr
5.2), hyperkalemia to 5.6, and bicarb of 14, with AG of 15.
First set of cardiac enzymes negative. HCT noted to be 22.5.
Guaiac negative on exam. INR expectedly subtherapeutic at 1.4
(had been off coumadin for last week in anticipation of
nephrostomy placement). CXR was clear. A CT abdomen/pelvis was
performed to evaluate his palpable abdominal mass. There was no
hernia or evidence of SBO. He received kayexylate, calcium
gluconate, and insulin/D50. Access is 1 PIV. Most recent VS:
96.9 56 166/81 15 98%RA. Renal was consulted and will see in the
ICU.

Currently, he feels well. Review of systems reveals that he was
a performance status 0 until the past month when he has been
experiencing a cough, weakness, fatigue, and night sweats. He
has not had any nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills, but has
noted a decreased appetite over the past four to six weeks. His
ileostomy stoma was working well, draining clear urine. He has
noted some intermittent right flank discomfort this prompted an
outpatient workup where he was diagnosed with a soft tissue
obstruction of his mid ureter consistent with possible ureteral
mass or TCC, with his baseline creatinine 1.2 becoming elevated
to 3.3 as of last week. He has also noted a cough for the past
month, which has been nonproductive and a chest x-ray last week
by history was negative.

Past Medical History:
1. Bladder Cancer dx [**2166**] - s/p radical cystectomy, left
nephrectomy, R urostomy placement. Has T4 N1 M1 disease with
left humerus and pelvic mets found in [**3-23**]. Had Chemo/XRT with

Bone Scan ([**2167-12-17**]): Whole body images of the skeleton were
obtained in anterior and posterior projections including static
dedicated views of the upper extremities and thorax. Multiple
foci of increased radiotracer uptake is demonstrated with the
largest region at the pubic symphysis right greater than left
and right inferior pubic ramus. Increased radiotracer uptake is
present in a left anterior rib, probably 5th, uncertain if post
traumatic or metastatic in nature. Increased tracer uptake also
projecting over the medial right scapula and lateral upper
thoracic ribs which is indeterminant. Increased tracer activity
is noted midline in the L2-L3 region concerning for metastatic
involvement.
Multiple regions of increased radiotracer uptake as described
above some
indeterminant and others consistent with metastatic disease.

CT Abdomen ([**2167-12-18**]): IMPRESSION:

1. Small-bowel obstruction secondary to parastomal small-bowel
herniation
within the right lower quadrant. This is worse compared to
[**2167-12-15**]. The
dilated ileal conduit has been decompressed seconary to Fioley
catheter.
Right nephrosotomy and ureteral stent are also new.

2. Sclerotic changes of the right pubic symphysis, right ischium
and right
ischial tuberosity concerning for metastatic disease. Additional
sclerotic
densities within the spine.

CT Chest ([**2167-12-22**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of lung metastasis.
No hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Given that the patient had many complex issues that were all
interrelated, this discharge summary is written in a narrative
form as opposed to a list form by problem. Also included is a
brief history that led patient to this hospitilization.
.
In [**2167-10-13**], patient was diagnosed with cystic cancer;
his left kidney, left ureter, entire bladder, and prostate were
removed, and an ileal conduit was created and connected to right
ureter. At this time, the patient did not undergo
chemoradiation. In [**2167-3-15**], mets were found in his left
humerous and left pelvis; patient then underwent chemotherapy
through [**2167-6-12**] and also had radiation therapy. In [**Month (only) **] of
[**2167**], the patient had a negative PET scan.
.
Since [**7-21**], ~ once per month, the patient noticed urostomy
wouldn't put out urine for an hour or so. In [**2167-10-13**],
he told his urologist about this decrease in output; his
urologist then sent him for IVP and loopogram, which
demonstrated an obstruction at the right mid-ureter. In this
context, the patient's creatinine had risen to 3.3 from 1.2. The
patient was subsequently referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] as an outpatient, who
recommended that given the above imaging, the patient should
undergo restaging of his disease with Bone Scan and CT Chest. He
also recommended that the patient undergo percutaneous
nephrostomy tube p
