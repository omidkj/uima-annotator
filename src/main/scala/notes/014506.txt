Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath (Transferred: Mitral valve rupture)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2124-9-8**] Mitral Valve Replacement (27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical
Valve)
[**2124-9-7**] Cardiac Cath

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year old woman with known CAD, s/p inferior wall MI
with bare metal stent to LCx on [**2124-8-4**], CHF with EF 40%. Since
that time she had been admitted several times with dyspnea. She
had been admitted on [**9-1**] to [**Hospital3 6592**] with increasing SOB,
getting extremely dyspneic with exertion. She was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital 74789**] Hospital on [**2124-9-2**] for further
management. There she was diuresed and ruled out for MI by
enzymes. She had been on heparin until this AM. As she was
persistently dyspneic, a TEE was performed on [**2124-9-5**] which
reportedly revealed severe mitral regurgitation with a ruptured
posterior chord; LVEF was calculated 40%. Patient at that time
was advised that they need valve surgery. Patient's family then
requesting that the patient be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management under Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] care.

Pertinent Results:
CNIS [**9-9**]: 1. 80-99% right ICA stenosis. 2. No significant left
ICA stenosis (graded as less than 40%). 3. Incomplete left-sided
subclavian. Cardiac Cath [**9-7**]: 1. Selective coronary
angiography of this left dominant system demonstrated no
angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary
artery disease. The LMCA had seperate ostia for LAD and LCX. The
LAD had mild narrowing at its ostium and 50% ostial stenosis in
the diagonal branch. The LCX was a dominant vessel with 40%
stenosis proximal to the prior stent which was widel patent. The
RCA was known to be a non-dominant vessel and was not engaged.
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressures were 8mmHg and
RVEDP wa 11mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were elevated
measuring 66/20mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were
significant elevated (mean PCW pressure was 29mmHg and LVEDP was
29mmHg). The systemic arterial pressures were within normal
range measuring 120/71mmgHg. There was no signficant gradient
across the aortic valve upon pull back from the left ventricle
to the ascending aorta. The cardiac index was depressed
measuring 1.58 l/min/m2. 3. Contrast ventriculography revealed a
depressed LVEF of 40% with infero posterior hypokinesis. There
was severe (4+) mitral regurgitation.
Echo [**9-8**]: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is moderate
to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
thinning of the inferior wall. The inferior, infero septal and
infero lateral walls are severely hypokinetic in the mid and
basal segments. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). 3. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. There is moderate global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. 4. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. A hypoechoic lesion is noted in the
anterior wall of the aortic arch possibly representing an
ulceration. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. An eccentric, posterior directed jet of MR is
seen.The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 7. There is no pericardial
effusion. POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient
was receiving vasoactive infusions including milrinbone,
epinephrine and phenylephrine. Pt is being AV paced. 1. A
well-seated bileaflet valve is seen in the mitral position with
normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 2 mmHg).
Trivial (normal for prosthesis) mitral regurgitation is seen. 2.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. 3. TR is unchanged
4. Aortic contours are intact post decannulation 5. Other
findings are unchanged
CXR [**9-14**]: Two views of the chest obtained and compared to
previous studies. When compared with the previous films, the
pulmonary artery line has been removed. The artificial valve in
place. The lungs are clear with the exception of bilateral
pleural effusions. There also is a dense convexity along the
left lateral chest, which could be partially artifact, but could
also represent some loculated fluid, this should be carefully
followed.
CXR [**9-18**]: Resolution of left pleural effusion. Improved right
pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with coronary artery
disease s/p inferior wall MI with PCI to L Circumflex [**8-4**] at an
outside hospital.   She had persistent dyspnea after her
catheterization and by [**9-2**] was found to have systolic CHF with
dyskinetic posterior wall and, on [**9-4**], was found by
transesophageal echocardiogram to have severe mitral
regurgitation secondary to posterior leaflet rupture. The
CHF/mitral regurgitation are likely sequelae of her MI. She has
inferior Q waves unfortunately.  She was transferred for
management of her mitral valve regurgitation.  On transfer, the
pt was hemodynamically stable but with somewhat tenuous with her
breathing status with continued dyspnea; saturating normally on
3 L oxygen with no accessory muscle use.  CT surgery was
consulted on arrival.  Aggressive diuresis was continued with
Lasix and metoprolol was used for heart rate and blood pressure
control. A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed
unchanged hemodynamics, but the patient was dyspneic with
orthopnea and increased oxygen requirement immediately following
cath, and was transferred to the CCU. There she was found to
have a VRE UTI and was started on linezolid pending her MVR.
Following aggressive medical management and ID consults she was
brought to the operating room where she underwent a mitral valve
replacement. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVIICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned
from sedation and awoke neurologically intact. She required
milrinone for several days post-op. Chest tubes were removed on
post-op
