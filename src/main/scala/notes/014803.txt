Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 39425**] is an 88 yo woman with a PMH of dementia, DM2, CKD
(baseline Cr 2.0), HTN, chronic subdural hematoma, recent GI
bleed and recent admission with ?sepsis/bradycardic
arrest/hypotension complicated by spinal cord infarct who
presented to the ED from nursing home with respiratory distress.

.
Per the nursing home, she was in her USOH until approximately 6
a.m. on the morning of admission, when she acutely desaturated
to 74%. With suctioning, chest PT and "breathing treatments,"
her sats improved to 92%. She then again became hypoxemic (to
the 70s), and she was placed on a NRB, at which point mental
staus changes became worrisome to the staff. She received 60 of
furosemide IV, and EMS was called.
.
The pt was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure in
transit to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the ED, initial VSs were temp of 101.0 HR
68, BP 80/59, RR 16, 100% vented. She was started on
norepinephrine for hypotension and given vancomycin and
ceftazadime.

STUDIES
----------
([**2124-7-8**]) HEAD CT
IMPRESSION:
1. No hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Brain and medial temporal atrophy.
.
([**2124-7-8**]) CHEST X-RAY
IMPRESSION: Consolidation in the left lower lobe with small
left-sided pleural effusion. Probable consolidation in the right
lower lobe.
.
.
([**2124-7-8**]) ECG
Normal sinus rhythm. T wave inversions in leads V1-V6 suggest
possible
anterior ischemia. Late R wave transition. Left axis deviation.
Probable left anterior fascicular block. Cannot exclude prior
inferior myocardial
infarction. Compared to the prior tracing of [**2124-6-18**] no
diagnostic change.
.
.
([**2124-7-10**]) CHEST X-RAY
Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged since [**7-8**], substantially
improved since [**6-28**]. Worsening left lower lobe consolidation
could be pneumonia or atelectasis. Lungs otherwise generally
clear. Heavy mitral annulus calcification noted may be
contributing to mitral regurgitation. ET tube and left
subclavian line in standard placements. Tubing coiled over the
stomach, cannot be localized with certainty on this single view.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
.
([**2124-7-10**]) ECG
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
Borderline left axis deviation - is nonspecific
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Delayed R wave progression - may be due to left ventricular
hypertrophy
Diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave changes
Since previous tracing of [**2124-7-8**], atrial fibrillation now
present, and further ST-T wave changes seen
.
([**2124-7-11**]) TRANS-ESOPHAGEAL ECHO
IMPRESSION: No definitive evidence of vegetations. However,
there are
filamentous strands on the aortic valve leaflets which are
likely normal
variant, but endocarditis cannot be entirely excluded.

DISCHARGE LABS:


Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly this is an 88 year old woman with multiple medical
issues (dementia, DM, CHF, CKD, spinal cord infarction with BLE
hemiplegia) who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, and
hypotension, found to have MRSA in sputum and BAL, coagulase
negative staph in blood and from PICC line and VRE in blood from
art line.
.
1.Respiratory failure: Pt admitted for hypoxemic respiratory
failure, intubated in field. See to have b/l pulmonary
consolidations on CXR. Sputum, BAL cultures grew BRSA.  Pt on
vancomycin initially, switched to PO linezolid on [**7-13**]. Pt
extubated in [**7-12**].  On d/c did not have oxygen requirement.
.
2. Sepsis: Pt was admitted with PICC line in place.  Blood
cultures from [**7-8**] grew coagulase negative staph, her PICC was
d/c'd on [**7-10**], the cath tip also grew CNS.  Surveillance
cultures the following day ([**7-11**]) grew VRE from a-line.
Vancomycin d/c'd and pt started on IV linezolid on [**7-13**] to cover
MRSA PNA as well as CNS and VRE bacteremia. ID was consulted and
recommended plan to continue linezolid PO on discharge for a
total of 2 week course.  Will check weekly CBCs to monitor for
pancytopenia.  Last day of linezolid [**2124-7-27**].
.
3. CKD: History of CKD and elevated creatinine on presentation.
During admission however, creatinine improved and is now below
previously recorded values. New baseline cr = 1.7. Pt started on
ACE-I prior to d/c.
.
4. DM2: Adequate blood glucose control on insulin sliding scale.
.
5. Anemia/h/o GIB: Pt's hematocrit was in high 20s for hospital
stay.  Anemia panel negative for hemolysis or iron deficiency.
No signs of acute bleed.  Anemia likely due to phlebotomy
superimposed on anemia of chronic disease.  Pt did not require
transfusion during this stay. On day of discharge Hct = 28.4.
.
6. C. diff: Patient was c. diff + on last admission, and her
antibiotic course was completed on [**2124-7-10**]. No signs of ongoing
infection. Pt continued on flagyl during this admission for
prophylaxis during treatment with antibiotics for her PNA and
bacteremia.  C diff toxin has been negative x 2 during this
admission. Pt to continue flagyl for one week after the
completion of linezolid course. Last day of flagyl [**2124-8-3**].
.
7. CAD/HTN: Pt had NSTEMI on last admission.  Had episode of
afib with RVR in unit, responded to labetalol.  Maintained on
labetalol with parameters, ASA and statin. On tele during
admission with no further events on floor. Pt was hyp
