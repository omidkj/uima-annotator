History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72 yo M myelofibrosis, h/o c.diff, h/o delirium who
presented to ED for AMS, fever. On the day of presentation, pt
was received his regularly scheduled Interferon for
myelofibrosis, then started to complain of nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea, as well as shortness of breath. He was then found to
be nonresponsive at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where he resides, thus
brought to the ED. Pt denied any chest pain/pressure.  Per
family, pt may have eaten an old [**Location (un) 6002**]. In the ED, he was
initially 98% on RA, then became hypoxic to 82%. He was placed
on 100% non-rebreather with O2 sats in low 90s. Ohter vs were:
105rectal 92  98/45, 32, 86%RA 92?NRB, lactate 4.8 (ua negative,
CXR with bilateral hazziness but no specific infiltrate).
Patient was given tylenol, 6L NS, vanc/dex/zosyn/ceftriaxone.
Repeat VS were 100.8, 60, 101/38, 95% 15L FMask.
.
On admission to the MICU pt was alert and oriented to self and
place only. He was somewhat combative, trying to pull off the
mask. He was hypoxic to low 90s on nonrebreather, and ABG was
7.26/44/98. Anesthesia was called and intubated the patient
uneventfully. Arterial line was placed in the left wrist. RIJ
was placed. He required Dopamine and Levophed to maintain his
MAP>60. EP was called to increase his V-pacing to 90 to increase
cardiac output.

CXR [**2-8**]: Perihilar opacities reflecting airspace pulmonary
edema. Likely
right pleural effusion.

CT Head [**2-9**]: No evidence of mass lesion. No acute intracranial
process.

CT Torso [**2-9**]: 1. Large right pleural effusion which is causing
compressive atelectasis of the posterior right upper and right
lower lobes.
2. New moderate left pleural effusion causing compressive
atelectasis of the posterior left upper lobe and complete
atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
3. Cecal and ascending colonic wall thickening, consistent with
colitis.
4. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
5. Unchanged ascites.

CXR [**2-13**]: Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have
been removed. The left PICC line is now seen extending to at
least the
cavoatrial junction. The distal tip is not well seen. Right
pleural effusion has decreased slightly, now moderate. Left
lower lobe collapse or effusion persists. Cardiac size is top
normal in size. Dense retrocardiac opacity persists. Aortic arch
calcifications and [**Month/Year (2) 4448**] are unchanged.

All microbiologic data no growth to date.  C diff negative x 3.
Sputum culture negative.

Echo
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global hypokinesis and septal
dysnchrony (LVEF = 40 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.3 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small circumferential
pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2-16**] post R thoracentesis
FINDINGS: Interval decrease in right pleural effusion following
thoracentesis, with residual small to moderate effusion
remaining and no
evidence of pneumothorax. Associated improvement in parenchymal
opacity at
the right lung base. Previously noted left pleural effusion is
difficult to assess due to exclusion of left costophrenic sulcus
from the radiograph, but there is at least a small residual left
effusion remaining as well as persistent left retrocardiac
opacification.


Brief Hospital Course:
#  Respiratory failure: In the [**Name (NI) **], Pt was hypoxic to low 90s on
non-rebreather, likely due to septic shock. Differential
diagnosis at first included pneumonia, pulmonary edema from CHF,
and ARDS. CXR showed diffuse haziness bilaterally and  chronic
pleural effusion R>L. He was intubated and sedated on admission
and ventilator settings were per ARDSnet protocol. He was given
multiple antibiotics on admission (see below), which would cover
pneumonia. He underwent bronchoscopy which showed scant
secretions and normal anatomy. BAL fluid was sent for gram stain
and cultures, which were negative. Urine legionella antigen was
also negative. At the time of transfer to the floor, he was
continued on ceftriaxone for presumed pneumonia even though
cultures were negative. The patient was transitioned to Precedex
on [**2-11**] due to intolerance of fentanyl/versed. This intolerance
should be noted for future reference. He was weaned from the
ventilator
