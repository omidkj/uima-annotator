CXR:
[**2116-9-1**]: The lower lung opacities, all
remain unchanged as are the bilateral pleural effusions. Both
upper lungs are aerated with no new areas of opacities. Heart
size is normal. The persisting bilateral lower lobe opacities
may represent atelectasis/pneumonic consolidation secondary to
aspiration. The right subclavian line is terminating into the
mid SVC.

CCT: [**2116-8-24**]: No evidence of main, lobar or segmental pulmonary
embolism.
Complete occlusion of the left lower lobe bronchus from
secretions with
atelectasis of the left lower lobe. Low-density areas are within
the
atelectatic left lower lobe suggestive of a pneumonic
consolidation.
Moderate left pleural effusion. Dilated and fluid filled
neoesophageus causing compressive atelectasis of the adjacent
lung. Possibility of distal obstruction is suspected. Mild
pneumomediastinum, minimal right sided pneumothorax and
subcutaneous emphysema along the right chest wall which are
likely post-procedure related.

Esophagus
[**2116-8-25**]: No evidence of leak. However, delay in gastric
emptying of
barium from the stomach into the duodenum with retention of
barium within the distal stomach.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted following [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy with
intrathoracic anastomosis. Buttressing of intrathoracic
anastomosis with pericardial fat.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy. She was extubated in the operating
room transfer to the TSICU for further monitoring with right
chest tube, JP, NGT, Foley and Epidural for pain.  She was
transfused 2 units of PRBC for HCT of 23>31. She transferred to
the floor POD 2.

Events: [**2116-8-26**] developed respiratory distress requiring
Non-rebreathe. She was transfer to the SICU requiring
intubation.  The Chest film revealed a Dilated esophagus likely
secondary to pylorus spasm. NGT was placed with 900 cc of
drainage.  Bedside bronchoscopy with suction of multiple mucus
plugs. On [**2116-8-27**] she was taken to the operating room for
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and balloon dilation of pylorus to 20
mm.  Over the next few days her respiratory status improved. She
was successfully extubated with oxygen saturations of 92-94% on
4 L via nasal cannula.  The NGT was removed on [**2116-9-1**]. She
transfer to the floor.  A clear liquid diet was initiated and
advanced to fulls slowly.

ID: Cultures were sent.  Sputum culture was positive for
ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES pan-sensitive.  On [**2116-8-26**] she was
started on 2 week course of cefePime 2 gms which was changed to
augmentin.

Respiratory: aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs, incentive
spirometer. On POD 5 she was noted to have acute episodes of
back pain thought to be muscle spasm, that was accompanied by an
increasing oxygen requirement from 3lNC up to 6L & NRB. A CT was
done to look for PE but thus was negative. Her respiratory
status improved but required supplemental oxygen 1-2 Liters.
Ambulating oxygen saturation 86% on room air, 2L 93%.  She was
discharged home with supplemental oxygen.

Drains: right chest and JP with minimal drainage, both were
removed without complication.

Card: Sinus Rhythm 60-70's without ectopy.  BP stable 110-130's.


GI: PPI, bowel regime continued. Pt had bowel movements
following surgery.  NGT was removed POD 5. Swallow study on
[**2116-8-25**] was negative for anastomose leak.

Nutrition: Replete was started POD 1 titrated to Goal 90 ml x 18
hours as recommended by the dietician. On [**2116-9-2**] she was
started on a clear liquid titrated to fulls slowly.

Renal: She had normal renal function. Electrolytes were replete
as needed.  Daily weights were stable. The Foley was removed
with good urine output.

Pain: Epidural with PCA Dilaudid. She transition to PO Roxicet
via J-tube with good control.

Disposition: She was seen by physical therapy and deemed safe
for home.  She was discharged on [**2116-9-3**] with oxygen, [**Hospital1 1474**]
VNA and her family. She will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
