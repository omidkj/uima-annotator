Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11182**] was admitted on [**2119-3-13**] and underwent cardiac cath
which revealed: a heavily calcified aorta, 70% stenosis of LMCA,
80% proximal LAD [**Last Name (un) 2435**]., 50% [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 8714**] [**Last Name (un) 2435**]., 90% mid RCA stenosis,
with a patent stent in the RCA SVG, a patent ramus SVG, and a
patent LIMA ->LAD.  An echo showed: severe valvular AS with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Location (un) 109**] of 0.5 cm2 with severe global LV dysfunction and an LVEF of
[**11-25**]%.  He had moderate pulmonary hypertension and moderate RV
dysfunction.  He had moderate MR, trace AI, and mild TR.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] was consulted.
The high risk nature of the surgery was discussed at length with
the patient and he wanted to proceed.  A chest CT was obtained
and the aortic calcification made it impossible to replace the
aortic valve conventionally.  On [**2119-3-24**] he underwent an
apical-aortic conduit with an 18mm valved conduit through a L
thorocotomy.  The total bypass time was 90 mins. He tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on
Amiodorone, Milrinone, Levophed, and Propofol. He was extubated
on POD#1, and his Milrinone and Levophed were weaned.  He was in
and out of afib.  He was transiently on Epi., and all of his
drips were weaned by POD#5.  His chest tube was d/c'd on POD#5
and he was transferred to the floor on POD#6.  He had some right
arm weakness and swelling and this was felt to be a brachial
plexus injury as his head CT was negative. He had diarrhea and
this decreased on Flagyl despite a negative c. diff. culture.
He continued to progress and was anticoagulated and on POD#11 he
was discharged to rehab in stable condition.
