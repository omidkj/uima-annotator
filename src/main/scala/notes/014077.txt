Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography

Peripherally inserted central catheter placement on [**10-14**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**] is a 64yo F with history of atrial fibrillation on
warfarin, mild mental retardation and history of CVA with left
sided paralysis who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent [**Hospital1 **] in
setting of elevated liver enzymes and concern for cholangitis.
Patient was tachypneic to 20-30s while awaiting [**Hospital1 **] and
intubated to protect her airway for the procedure.  She became
hypoxic to 70s% during induction and remained intubated after
the procedure.

Per records, patient presented to [**Hospital3 6592**] on [**10-5**] with
epigastric pain.  She was found to have elevated LFTs (initially
only mildly elevated, see below for details) and had an
abdominal ultrasound and CT which showed possible stones in the
gallbladder without common bile duct dilation.  She also was
diagnosed with a UTI but had a negative urine culture.  While at
the OSH, she had a CXR on [**10-8**] that showed cardiomegaly without
pulmonary edema and questionable left lower lung atelectasis.
She also had a nuclear medicine cardiology scan with EF noted to
be 90% and "technically it was not ideal" but no evidence of
ischemia.  There is also an echo report that comments on normal
EF, moderately dilated LA, evidence of ASD repair although "not
clear if patch is still intact or not", moderate MR, moderate TR
and RVSP is 51mmHg.  Patient received two doses of 5mg vitamin K
the day prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for [**Hospital1 **] before a possible cholcystectomy.

At [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent [**Hospital1 **] with biliary stenting (no
sphincteromy given INR 2.0) that was unremarkable without
evidence of cholangitis or biliary obstruction.  She received
ceftriaxone 1g IV and ampicillin 2g IV during [**Hospital1 **].  Patient
remained intubated after the procedure and was transferred to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she is intubated
and sedated.  She squeezes right hand to command but does not
squeeze on left.  She does not open eyes to command.

Past Medical History:
Mental retardation
History of embolic CVA, now with left hemiplegia
Hypertension
Depression
Chronic CHF of unknown etiology
h/o alcohol abuse, sober since [**2091**]
s/p ASD repair

Social History:
She lives in a nursing home.  Patient quit smoking years ago and
quit drinking alcohol in [**2091**].  No illicit drug use.  She is
wheelchair bound at home.

Family History:
Unable to obtain.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9449**] is a 64yo F with history of mental retardation,
atrial fibrillation and CVA with left hemiplegia who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for [**Hospital1 **] and intubated for respiratory
distress likely secondary to volume overload & pneumonia;
successfully extubated on [**10-13**].

# Respiratory distress: Patient was tachypneic to 20-30s while
awaiting [**Month/Year (2) **] and intubated to protect her airway for the
procedure. She became hypoxic to 70s% during induction and
remained intubated after the procedure. Respiratory distress
likely caused by CHF exacerbation secondary to volume overload,
in addition to healthcare-associated pneumonia (BNP 3344). CXR
was concerning for infiltrate or pulmonary edema. Echo with EF
>55% with mild pulmonary hypertension. Treated with vancomycin
and cefepime for HCAP with a planned 8-day course (D1=[**10-10**],
last day [**10-17**]). She was treated with IV lasix for her volume
overload.  Lasix was held on [**10-14**] due to agressive diuresis,
but redosed on the morning of discharge based on exam and repeat
chest x-ray.  She should resume her usual home dose of oral
lasix on [**10-16**].

# LFT abnormalities: Her [**Month/Year (2) **] was unremarkable and did not show
any frank pus from the biliary system s/p stent placement. Will
need repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] for stent removal in 2 months (appointment has
already been scheduled). LFTs trended down during admission.

# Atrial fibrillation and h/o CVA: Coumadin was restarted when
it was clear that the patient would not be undergoing any other
procedure during thi
