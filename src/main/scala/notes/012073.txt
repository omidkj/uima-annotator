Chief Complaint:
[**First Name3 (LF) **].

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory Laparotomy, with Lysis of adhesions

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 80 year old male who was recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**2-7**] to [**2-11**] for right SDH and SAH under neurosurgery
who was readmitted this a.m. after witnessed [**Month/Day (1) 862**].
.
Patient was recently admitted on [**2-7**] s/p mechanical fall (fell
on ice) and found to have SAH, SDH. No surgical intervention was
done and he was discharged on [**2-11**] to rehab. He represented to
OSH last evening after episode of witnessed [**Month/Day (1) 862**] (left
cheek/mouth tremors, both eyes tremors, L sided weakness and
expressive aphagia) where CT head showed SAH, SHD. Initially
hypertensive to SBP 225 and was given dilantin 1 gm, 3mg ativan
to control seizures and BP stabalized. Intubated with propofol
for decreased MS (initially had been A&O x 3, not hypoxic, but
meds caused sedation) which was difficult d/t laryngeal CA and
large right sided laryngeal mass was noted. Also recieved
rocephin 1gm and 3.5L NS for fever. Patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Repeat CT head upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] showed stable SAH and R SDH
from prior scan on [**2-8**]. In ED patient was HD stable (67, 133/78,
17, 100%) except for temperature of 102.2 for which he was given
a dose of levofloxacin/flagyl. Was noted to have left cheek and
eye tremor x 5 min and started on ativan gtt for approx. 3 hrs
prior to stopping. Given lopressor 5mg IV x 1 for elevated CE,
EKG with 'ST elevations' in ant leads. Also received 2L NS.
Transferred to neurosurgery ICU where neurosurgery did not feel
patient required surgical intervention and he was transferred to
medicine for further w/u of cardiac issues and fever.
.
Currently patient is intubated but able to answer questions
appropriately. He denies chest pain, jaw pain, pain in arm, pain
in belly. Breathing comfortably. Per family, patient has not had
any complaints except for HA, right eye pain, and photophobia
since fall, all unchanged in severity. No dysuria, URI sxs, sick
contacts.

Imaging:
Head CT ([**2118-2-12**]): The subdural collection in the right temporal
lobe measures 9.3 cm and is not significantly changed compared
to the prior study. Subdural blood is also seen layering over
the right parietal and occipital convexities into hemorrhage.
Blood
layering within the atria of the ventricles bilaterally has
decreased. Arachnoid blood is seen in the bilateral temporal,
parietal, and right frontal lobes. This is slightly less
prominent when compared to the prior examination. There is no
shift of the normally midline structures or uncal herniation.
The ventricles are unchanged in size.
IMPRESSION:
Decreased extent of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. The
subdural
hemorrhage has not significantly changed in size.
.
Repeat Head CT [**2118-2-13**]: not yet read, no obvious change.
.
CXR [**2118-2-12**]: No acute CP process. ET tube 5.7 cm above carina.
.
CT neck without contrast:
The patient is intubated and the airway is collapsed around the
endotracheal tube. Two foci of air are seen adjacent to the
hyoid bone. Foci of air are also seen posterior to the right and
left clavicles. The lack of IV contrast limits evaluation of the
vasculature.
1. Foci of air posterior to clavicle of uncertain significance
possibly secondary to attempted line placement.
2. Foci of air anterior to endotracheal tube may be secondary to
traumatic intubation.
.
EKG [**2118-2-12**]: NSR at 65, nml axis, nml intervals, Q wave in V1 and
V2, ST elevation V1-V3 with 0.5 st depression in V5, poor R wave
progression.
Repeat ECG [**2118-2-13**]: new deep TWI V2-V4 with ST elevation >1.0-1.5
with Q waves (not new).
.
ECHO [**2118-2-12**] (no prior to compare to): [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated. Mild
LVH. No masses or thrombi. LVSF mod depressed with regionality
c/w CAD (EF 25-30%). Mild global RV free wall HK. No AS, AR.
Trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) 5544**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] effusion.
.
KUB [**2118-2-15**]: There are multiple dilated small bowel loops
throughout the abdomen. Maximum small bowel diameter measures
4.6 cm. No definite air-fluid levels are seen. No free air is
seen under the diaphragms. The colon is collapsed. There is a
small amount of air within the rectum. Visualized portions of
the lung appear clear. There is a lumbar levoscoliosis without
associated degenerative changes centered around L3-L5.
IMPRESSION: Multiple dilated small bowel loops throughout the
abdomen with decompressed colon, consistent with small bowel
obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 80 year old man s/p recent fall c/b SDH and SAH who
representsed with [**Month/Day/Year 862**], elevated cardiac enzymes, and fevers
who was intubated for airway protection, now extubated with
small bowel obstruction.
.
#. Small bowel obstruction: Unclear etiology, developed in the
early morning [**2-15**], KUB showed likely SBO, NGT placed/surgery
consulted, large volume gastric fluid out of NGT with some
relief of nausea. Guaiac negative. Had abdominal CT scan
overnight [**2-16**] also wet read + for SBO, surgery following,
possible surgical intervention [**2-16**]. Febrile as well, will start
zosyn Will change diet to NPO, IVF for maintenance, all meds to
IV if possible, hold bowel regimen for now, monitor closely for
further abdominal pain/hemodynamic instability, guaiac all
stools. Anzemet prn for nausea. Will discuss with cards
perioperative management given recent acute MI (will increase
metoprolol). Given bloody NGT return increase PPI to [**Hospital1 **]. INR
1.4, will give vitamin K 2mg sc.  Patient was taken to OR on
[**2-16**] for exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions. There
was no obvious cause of bowel obstruction. The patient continued
post-operatively to have an ileus. He was managed with NPO, IV
fluids and TPN. Serial KUBs were obtained which continued to
show post-op ileus, his abdomen became less distended
