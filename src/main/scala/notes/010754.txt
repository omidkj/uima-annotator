History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with a h/o COPD (FEV1 22%, 3L baseline oxygen) Htn, DL,
Afib who presents with suddent onset acute dyspnea this AM.
Patient was eating breakfast, coughed up sputum and then took
some cough syrum, and felt unrelenting SOB. Although patient was
denying this, patient's wife says that he was feeling tired and
short of breath x 2 weeks. Patient tried some nebs at home, but
this didnt help. Family called EMS and they found patient to
have a sat 80% on RA. He received 2 nebs enroute and felt
better. He denies fevers, chills, chest pain. Reports unchanged
chronic cough,  and unchanged chronic back pain.
.
On arrival patient triggered for sat 99% on 3L. Exam otherwise
notable for tight breath sounds bilaterally, and noticeable
using accessory muscles. Received combivent neb, solumedrol 125
mg, and azithro 500 mg po x1. CXR and CTA chest were
unremarkable except for chronic changes. Was doing well on 3L,
but felt more tired so he was transitioned to bipap. EKG with
RAD, RBBB (new since [**2192**]. Patient was growing more
uncomfortable on bipap, so he took it off for about 30 minutes,
but still sounded tight, so he was placed back on bipap 10/5
with FiO2 50%. Patient had increased WOB, and did not tolerate
Bipap so was intubated and started on propafol prior to
transfer.  On propafol, patient dropped his BP to 84/65 so he
was changed to versed, and he was detached from the vent in case
of contribution of auto-peep. 1 L of NS was hung, and BP
improved to SBP 100s.
.
In the ICU, patient is intubated and sedated.

[**4-24**] CXR
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma, with massive signs
of
overinflation, right basal scarring, bilateral apical scarring
and bullous
disease, and signs of massive pulmonary emphysema. Small cardiac
silhouette.  No evidence of pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
77M with severe COPD on home O2 admitted with COPD exacerbation
requiring intubation, course complicated by labile blood
pressures and failure to extubate x2, now s/p trach and PEG.
.
Respiratory Failure: Patient was admitted to ICU after being
intubated for respiratory failure. He was started on IV steroids
and transitioned to prednisone with plan for slow taper, dose at
20mg daily at time of discharge. Albuterol and ipratropium
inhalers given standing. Extubation was attempted twice but pt.
failed [**2-19**] agitation, hemodynamic instability. Family discussion
was held and decision was made to proceed with tracheostomy and
PEG. Procedure was uncomplicated and he was transitioned to
trach mask which he has tolerated well. Trach settings should
continue to be weaned.
.
Labile blood pressures: Pt's BP ranged from 80 to 200 systolic
during this [**Month/Day (2) **]. Diltiazem was titrated up and down and
final dose was diltiazem 45mg Q6H with good effect. SBP mostly
in the 100s-140s at time of discharge. Home losartan restarted.
.
Delirium: Patient was noted to be delirious during
hospitalization, particularly on hospital days 10 and 11. He
responded well to haloperidol and did not appear delirious at
time of discharge, was cooperative and pleasant. Discharged with
small dose of PRN haloperidol as 1mg PO dose oversedated him.
QTc wnl.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Patient was in sinus during this
[**Month/Day (2) **] with one very brief period of AF with RVR to the 130s
which quickly converted to SR on its own. No antiocoagulation,
see above for rate control with diltiazem.
.
# Code status: Patient was made DNR during this [**Month/Day (2) **] after
family meeting. Proxy is daughter [**Name (NI) 15484**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 21800**]).
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-continue prednisone taper, 20mg x2 days to start [**4-27**] AM, then
10mg x3 days, then 5mg x3 days, then stop
-wean trach requirements as tolerated
-monitor BPs and adjust diltiazem prn
