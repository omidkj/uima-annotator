Admission Date:  [**2171-4-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2171-4-16**]


Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea, fatigue, diaphoresis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 104834**] is a 77-year-old male
with a history of hypertension, alcoholism, and tobacco abuse
who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department on the afternoon of admission
complaining of dyspnea earlier in the day.  He had a feeling
of indigestion accompanied by diaphoresis, chills, and
nausea.  He became progressively dyspneic throughout the
afternoon and presented to the Emergency Room.

In the Emergency Department, he was initially treated with
Lasix and antibiotics.  Despite these measures he remained
tachypneic and was intubated for distress and worsening
hypoxia.  He received 3 liters of fluid in the Emergency
Department over roughly six hours with no urine output.  At
the time of intubation, his blood pressure had dropped to a
systolic of 80, and he was started on dopamine.

There was a report of weight loss over the past three months
along with malaise.  There was no history of chest pain.  No
recent history of gastrointestinal illnesses.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Depression.
3.  Alcoholism.
4.  Tobacco use of one pack per day times 50 years.
5.  Gout.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.
7.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
8.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Micardis 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Effexor.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and retired.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes in multiple
family members.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Admission physical
examination with vital signs which revealed a temperature
of 99.7, heart rate of 115, blood pressure of 96/41,
ventilator setting of FVC of 500 X 14, FIO2 of 50%, positive
end-expiratory pressure of 5.  In general, intubated but
alert.  Answered questions.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements were intact.  Neck revealed
elevated jugular venous pressure.  No bruits.  Lungs revealed
rhonchorous breath sounds throughout.  Scattered bibasilar
end-expiratory crackles.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities were
thin, hairless, good pulses, no edema, cool.  Skin revealed
no rash.  Neurologically, moved all extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Admission
laboratories with a white blood cell count of 15.1
(85% neutrophils and no bands), hematocrit of 33.7, platelets
of 309, mean cell volume of 111.  SMA-7 revealed a sodium
of 145, potassium of 5, chloride of 108, bicarbonate of 26,
blood urea nitrogen of 20, creatinine of 1.6, and glucose
of 259.  Calcium of 8.5, phosphorous of 7.5, magnesium
of 2.1.  Creatine kinase of 43, troponin of 2.  Arterial
blood gas status post intubation was 7.23/56/238 on 50% FIO2
and 5 of positive end-expiratory pressure.  Hepatic enzymes
revealed ALT of 17, AST of 42, alkaline phosphatase of 161,
total bilirubin of 0.4, amylase of 113.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray revealed small right pleural
effusion, diffuse interstitial alveolar infiltrates
bilaterally (left greater than right); new compared to
[**2171-3-19**].

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a rate into
the 120s, normal intervals, normal axis, Q waves in V2 and
V3, poor R wave progression, ST elevations in V2 to V4 noted
along with 1.5-mm ST depressions in V5 to V6.  These changes
were new compared to [**2167-12-25**] electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was originally admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of respiratory
distress thought to be secondary to pneumonia.

Over the course of the first 24 hours the patient started
ruling in for a myocardial infarction, and he was emergently
transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] to undergo cardiac
catheterization.

The patient did undergo cardiac catheterization which
revealed the following vascular abnormalities:  The left main
was calcified but okay, the left anterior descending artery
had a 99% focal clot in the proximal region, and the left
circumflex had a 95% large second obtuse marginal and a 70%
distal circumflex lesion in the AV groove.  The right
coronary artery had a 90% middle and a diffusely diseased
posterior descending artery.  Stents were placed to the left
anterior descending artery and large second obtuse marginal.
The patient had elevations of his pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure, along with
borderline hypotension on high-dose Levophed; so an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  The patient was then
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further care.

At the time of presentation, the patient had also been anuric
for the first 24 hours of his admission.

Over the next 72 hours, the patient continued to have
progressive oliguria becoming increasingly refractory to
diuretics.  His creatinine was rising, and he became fluid
overloaded.  Though we were able to wean pressors and
intra-aortic balloon pump was off for cardiac support, the
fluid overload secondary to his worsening renal failure was
refractory to medical therapy.

Hemodialysis was initiated on [**2171-4-9**].  Prior to
hemodialysis, the patient had multiple weaning trials which
he had failed felt secondary to fluid overload in his lungs.

Despite several rounds of hemodialysis, which the patient
tolerated well, his weaning mechanics were still noted to be
quite poor.  After 16 days of intubation, the goals of the
patient's care were revised and advance support was
withdrawn.  The patient was extubated on [**2171-4-15**] after
getting his fourth round of dialysis; and over the next 18
hours, he was made comfortable as his cardiopulmonary
parameters decompensated.

The patient was pronounced dead at 6:20 a.m. on the morning
of [**2171-4-16**].

DIAGNOSIS AT DEATH:
1.  Intraseptal myocardial infarction leading to cardiogenic
shock with subsequent multiorgan failure.
2.  Inability to wean off ventilator despite successful
diuresis.

NOTE:  The patient was notified of the patient's death, and
voluntary postmortem examination was refused, and funeral
home was to make arrangements.
