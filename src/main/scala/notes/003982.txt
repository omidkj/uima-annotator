Ext: Warm, well-perfused 1+edema, -varicosities
Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**2-1**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 3.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. 5. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There
is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.  6. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study,
the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions including
phenylephrine and is being AV paced. 1. A well-seated
bioprosthetic valve is seen in the Aortic position with normal
leaflet motion and gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. Biventricular function is preserved. 3. MR appeared to be
slightly worse with AV pacing. No [**Male First Name (un) **] physiology noted 4. A
slight hypoechoic area noted in the Ascending aorta with no
obvious dissection flaps noted. 5. Other findings are unchanged

[**2-3**] CXR: 1) No evidence of pneumothorax following tube removal.
2) Mid sternal lucency at proximal aspect of sternotomy, which
can occasionally be seen normally in the early postoperative
period. Correlation with physical exam findings and follow up
chest radiograph may be helpful to exclude early sternal
dehiscence. 3) Worsening left lower lobe atelectasis and new
small left pleural effusion.

telemetry floor for further care. On post-op day two her chest
tubes were removed. On post-op day three her epicardial pacing
