Chief Complaint:
malaise

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral Central Line


History of Present Illness:
44 y/o man with HIV (last cd4 over 440 on [**9-3**]; VL was 2.4 K at
this time and had been previously undetectable for years), MRSA
skin infection [**5-3**] with necrotic component requiring extensive
OR debridement, mult MVC who presents to the ED today
complaining of 1 day of generalized malaise, lightheadedness,
and lt. flank pain.  He denies fevers, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea.
.
ED course:
.
On arrival to the ED he is found to be hypotense in the 60's,
febrile to 101.  2 PIV's were placed, fem line placed (under
sterile conditions per the ED), and he was given 4 l ns bolused
without significant response.  He was then started on dopamine
and NS continued.  Dopamine was not having significant effect,
and levophed was added.  With the addition of levophed and a
total of 8 litres of NS, his BP came up to 100 systolic.  He
began to cough, and briefly desaturated to the low 90's - there
was some concern that he may be experiencing flash pulmonary
edema, and he was placed on a NRB with sats of 100.  He did not
experience further respiratory distress at this time.
.
He was started on Vanc, CTX, Flagyl, and Bactrim emperically.
Blood cultures times two were drawn and are pending.  His UA was
clean.  His CXR was concerning for PCP pna per the formal read.
His Cr. was noted to be 2.3 (normal baseline) and his initial
lactate was 6.0.  Of note his wbc was 3.7 with 34% bands.  He
was sent for abdominal-pelvic CT with oral contrast only which
did not reveal overt pathology.   An abdominal u/s also was
unrevealing.  FAS scan was negative, and there was no evidence
of pericardial fluid.  He denied HA or meningisimus.   He was
Guaiac negative.  A V/Q was ordered as no source of infection
was clearly identified.

splint
NEURO: alert, oriented, pressured speech, moves all four, gait

Pertinent Results:
RUQ U/S:Normal liver echotexture. Collapsed gallbladder with a
rather thickened wall. Aside from the thick wall, no signs of
cholecystitis. No bil dil. Findings may be related to chronic
disease/HIV. As I did not have this history for the CT torso,
please consider PCP pneumonia for lung findings.
.
CXR at 5 pm: IMPRESSION:  Parenchymal opacities throughout the
right lung consistent with pneumonia.
.
Another CXR on admission 2:13 pm: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
Comparison is made to prior radiograph from [**2164-5-1**].  The
lungs are fully expanded and clear.  The heart size is normal.
There is no pulmonary vascular congestion or pleural effusions.
The mediastinum and hilar contours are normal.  Once again, a
ring is visualized in the left nipple. IMPRESSION:  No
pneumonia.
.
CT chest, abdomen, pelvis without contrast:
.
1.  Extremely limited exam given the lack of IV contrast.  The
presence or absence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection
cannot be assessed.
.
2.  Multiple nodular patchy opacities within the lungs, greatest
at the apices.  Atypical infections are considered.
.
3.  Coronary artery calcifications.
.
CT of the HEAD: IMPRESSION:  No intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.

Brief Hospital Course:
44 year old man with Hx. HIV with unknown CD4 count, mult MVCs
and recent MRSA thigh infection requiring extensive surgical
debridement who pesented to the ED with one day of generalized
malaise and lt. flank pain found to have hypotension,
tachycardia, fever, and CXR and CT concerning for atypical
pneumonia.
.
# Sepsis: Pt. has required 8 litres of ns and two pressors.
Urine clean, Abd CT and u/s without overt pathology, CT of the
chest (although limited by lack of contrast) possibly suggestive
of apical, atypical, pneumonic process.  He remained stable on
the floor although his pressures remained low and it took the
better part of a day to wean the patient off of pressors.
Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics but insisted
on leaving AMA on Friday afternoon.  The primary team strongly
discouraged the patient, discussed risks including hypotension,
infection, sepsis, endocarditis, and death but patient was
adamant.  He agrees he willl follow-up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-31**] days.
.
# HIV: ID was consulted.  ARV were held for one day, then
restarted.  Patient was instructed to continue ARV as directed
by his PCP when he left AMA.
.
# Transaminitis, elevated bili: Enclear etiology - radiology U/S
final read concerning for hepatitis, but hepatitis serologies
were negative.  In the end was attriburted to shock liver [**3-1**]
hypoperfusion.
