Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 20585**] was admitted on [**3-14**]. Due to operative
emergencies, surgery was postponed to the following day. On
[**3-15**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed an aortic valve replacement
and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. For surgical
details, please see seperate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, she was brought to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident. She weaned from inotropic
support without difficulty. She maintained stable hemodynamics
as beta blockade was resumed. Her CSRU course was otherwise
uneventful and she transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
three. She remained in a normal sinus rhythm. Beta blockade was
slowly advanced as tolerated. She remained fluid overloaded and
continue to require diuresis. Over several days, she continued
to make clinical improvements and was eventually cleared for
discharge on postoperative day 7.
