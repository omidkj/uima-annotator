Imaging:
CXR Portable AP [**9-16**]: Portable semi-upright chest radiograph
reviewed.  The lungs are grossly clear.  The pleura are normal
without pneumothorax.  The heart and mediastinal contours are
within normal limits.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  The
right subclavian central venous catheter overlies the lower SVC.

.
CT Spine: negative for fracture
Head CT: negative
.
MRI head:
Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct. The
ventricles and extraaxial spaces are normal in size. There are
no focal signal abnormalities or evidence of age inappropriate
brain or medial temporal atrophy. Following gadolinium, no
abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal enhancement seen.
Mild mucosal thickening is seen in both mastoid air cells.
Again noted is occipitalization of C1 with mild tonsillar
ectopia.
IMPRESSION: No significant change or evidence of acute infarct.
No enhancing lesions. No mass effect, hydrocephalus, or focal
signal abnormalities.
.
EEG:
This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and sleeping stages
due to the bursts of generalized slowing seen in drowsiness.
This is a
nonspecific finding which may be observed with deep midline
subcortical
dysfunction, or could represent a state of altered sleepiness.
.
Right upper ex ultrasound: no DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old woman with IDDM, HTN, [**Doctor Last Name 933**], Hep. C, depression
admitted with altered mental status thought likely due to DKA.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM
.
1) DM1- DKA on admission.  In the ICU, pt was started on insulin
gtt and seen by the [**Last Name (un) **] consult team.  Weaned off insulin gtt
within a few hours as her AG closed and started on NPH 70/30.
DKA thought secondary to medication non compliance. However, an
evaluation for occult infection was also performed as well (see
below).  She was transferred to the floor and was stable.
Subsequently she had a hypoglycemic seizure.  She was seen by
neuro and transferred back to the MICU.  She was intubated
briefly for airway protection.  Her blood glucose stabilized and
she was transferred back to the floor.  We adjusted her insulin
regimen so that she now is getting glargine 33mg qhs and insulin
humalog sliding scale FOUR times a day.  She has very close
followup with [**Last Name (un) **].
.
2) Infectious Diseases - The pt was febrile to 101.6 in ED with
occasional fevers while in the ICU and on the floor. The pt was
pan-cultured several times (see above). C.diff was also sent
given the pt's diarrhea, however was negative. Had leukocytosis
on admission which trended down.  She had fevers after her
seizure so an LP was performed.  It showed 10 WBCs which, in the
setting of a seizure and altered mental status - she was treated
for presumed meningitis with vanco and meropenem for 10d.  Her
fevers stopped and she successfully completed her antibiotics.
.
3) Psych: The patient had a flat affect and even was catatonic
briefly during her stay.  She was evaluated closely by the
neurologists and psychiatrists.  We performed multiple imaging
modalities and lab studies.  Her only metabolic abnormality was
thyroid disease (see below).  We started remeron 30mg qhs and
then zoloft 25mg qd during her stay.  She had significant
improvement in her mood.  She had also experienced some
dementia/neurocognitive deficits associated with this
depression.  The etiology was unclear.  However, given the lack
of imaging abnormalities and her improvement, it was thought not
to be neurologic in origin.  We scheduled her for neurocognitive
testing as an outpatient.  We also scheduled her for a VNA and
also "best" program to help with her mood and deficits.  Her
family was counseled substantially on the importance of
assisting the patient with her illnesses.
.
3) HTN - As the pt was hypotensive on admission, BP meds were
held while in the ICU, but were restarted once transferred to
the floor with good result.
.
4) [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease - On admission, had an undetectable TSH and
elevated free T4, likely [**2-22**] medication non-compliance. Pt's
hyperthyroid state may have contributed to compliants of
diarrhea. Methimazole was restarted and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs, the pt
will likely need RAI ablation of thyroid for more definitive
treatment in the future. Will recheck TFTs in four days to check
for response on methimazole treatment.
.
5) Reactive Airways disease - The pt was continued on outpatient
meds.
.
6) Hepatitis C - LFTs stable. The pt has never been on antiviral
therapy.
