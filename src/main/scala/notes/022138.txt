Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 77 F with h/o dementia (Alzheimer's vs. [**Last Name (un) 309**] body) from
NH presented with pulmonary edema.  Hospital course by problem
.
#) CAD: The patient had a concerning ECG as well as a troponin
leak.  We were concerned she had an NSTEMI.  Heparin, aspirin,
plavix, and metoprolol were administered.  We discussed options
of therapy with the patient's HCP who recommended no cardiac
catheterization.  Instead we optimized medical management of her
CAD.  She did not have any episodes of chest pain or acute
distress after her respiratory issues resolved.  On discharge,
she was on aspirin, plavix, and Toprol XL for CAD treatment.
.
#) Rhythm:  The patient developed atrial fibrillation with RVR.
It was difficult to rate control so we uptitrated metoprolol.
We also briefly treated with diltiazem gtt.  This was weaned and
she returned to NSR.  To maintain NSR upon discharge, amiodarone
was initiated.  We discharged her on a tapering regimen.  We
also discharged her with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor to have
results obtained and faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for med monitoring.  She
should continue on this medication unless told otherwise.  In
terms of anticoagulation, we discussed anticoagulation with the
patient's HCP.  [**Name (NI) 227**] her other medical issues, it was
determined that she is not a good anticoagulation candidate.
.
#) Pump:  Pump function as per echo.  On presentation, she was
hypertensive and tachycardic (with atrial fibrillation).  We
believe this led to diastolic dysfunction causing her acute
pulmonary edema.  With diuresis, blood pressure control, rate
and rhythm control her function improved.  She received
intermittent dosages of lasix 20IV if she had increased O2
requirement.
.
#) Acute on CRI: Patient has baseline Cr of 2.0.  After
diuresis, it increased to 3.0 but improved to 2.2 prior to
discharge.  We renally dosed meds.
.
#) HTN: She was quite hypertensive on admission and throughout
parts of her hospitalization.  We stopped the atenolol given her
Acute on CRI.  We started metoprolol and uptitrated.  She also
was on a nitro gtt initially (also for CHF).  Once this was
weaned to off, we initiated therapy with amlodipine as well as
HCTZ.  Her BP meds may need further adjustment as an outpatient.
 We held her lisinopril on admit given her ARF.  We continued to
hold it given her borderline hyperkalemia. She will be
discharged with Toprol XL 50mg po Qday, HZCT 25mg po qday, and
Amlodipine 10mg poi Qday.
.
#) Hypothyroidism: TSH normal.  rx with synthroid
.
#) Dementia: rx with home meds
.
#) FEN: regular with supplements
.
#) Dispo status: patient is minimally verbal.  She has
difficulty with simple commands.  She was on RA or up to only 2L
prior to discharge.  She was pleasant and comfortable.
.
#) Code: DNR/DNI.  Discussed with daughter/HCP.  She also
requests no escalation of care.  IE: no pressors or central
venous lines.
