History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y.o with hx ischemic cardiomyopathy, CRF, DM,
PVD, afib d/c from [**Location (un) 620**] yesterday to [**Hospital1 **] admited for AMS
change now p/w LOC. Yesterday, at 11:55 am while on bedpan, he
was found unresponsive. Compressions were started and pt. "woke
up" at 12:10pm. HR was irregular 108, BP 170/78, resp 18, sat
100% NRB. Per EMTS HR 52-73, BP 105-151/54-120, RR 188, 98%
venti.
.
Of note, the patient was recently hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 2728**]
for acute mental status change, confusion, disorientation and
agitation. He was intubated until [**5-30**], with MRI without
evidence of acute stroke, hemorrhage, encephalitis. Evaluated be
neuro and ID in the setting of elevated INR. Spiked a fever
during admission related to pneumonia. It was thought that the
weakness was [**12-21**] bradycaria, poor PO intake and acute renal
failure and/or vascular dementia EEG showed no seizures, TEE
without thrombus or endocarditis. Cr improved with hydration and
held off home Lasix at d/c. He had a mild troponin leak, 2D echo
with improvement of EF, BB and CCB held. At d/c HR 60-70. 7/10
[**11-22**] MRSA from blood, PICC placed requiring 2 weeks of
vancomycin. Because of a fever during the admission, started on
Levofloxacin with plan to continue for 1 week post d/c for asp
vs HCAP. During this stay he also had a GIB with coffee ground
emesis, Hct stable, started PPI. RUQ U/S NL for elevated bili.
.
In the ED, he was febrile to 103.2 with hypotension (83/37) so
he was admitted tot he MICU. In the ICU, he was briefly on
vanc/zosyn for pneumonia, though the CXR was negative. He was
then continued on the vanco/levo he was previously on from prior
hospital stay. He remained hemodynamically stable in the unit.


Past Medical History:
- Aortic stenosis with AVR with a bioprosthetic (pericardial)
valve
- Coronary artery bypass graft times two with saphenous vein
graft to left anterior descending and OM
- Postoperative atrial fibrillation
- Asthma
- Diabetes mellitus
- Gout
- Hyperlipidemia
- Hypothyroidism


Social History:
He lives at home until [**1-25**]. He was independent in his ADLs and
IADLs, but family had noted decline in his mental status for the
last few weeks prior to admission. No history of smoking,
alcohol, or drug abuse. IN rehab since [**1-25**]

Family History:
Non-contributory.

HEENT: elderly male, chronically ill appearing
CV: +3/6 systolic murmur
Lung: CTA b/l

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old with an ischemic
cardiomyopathy, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus,
peripheral vascular disease, tachy-brady syndrome who was
admitted from rehab for bradycardic arrest versus syncope.  He
was monitored initially in the MICU because of concern for an
out of hospital arrest.  He was then transferred to the floor
where he was observed for several days, but then became
progressively tachycardic and hypotensive with concern for
septic shock.  He was ultimately intubated and on pressors.
After he survived a PEA arrest in the MICU, a family meeting was
held and patient was made DNR/DNI with no escalation of care.
He passed away on [**6-10**] with his family at the bedside.

Septic shock.  Patient's source of infection was not clear.
Possible etiologies included line sepsis (though PICC line was
removed), pneumonia (though sputum cultures were negative),
prostethic valve endocarditis (though he had no positive blood
cultures and TTE at [**Hospital1 18**] was negative for endocarditis), c.
diff (though stool cultures were negative here), abdominal
source (patient had nausea and emesis with all meals).  Patient
had [**11-22**] blood cultures positive for MRSA on [**5-28**] at
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] with no clear source (?skin source) and he
remained on vanco throughout the hospital stay.  Additionally,
he had stenotrophomonas and klebsiella in his sputum at
[**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] which was covered by the Levaquin he was being
treated with on admission.

In the MICU, his antibiotics were broaded to
vanco/cefepime/flagyl/levaquin.  NO infectious source was found.
 He required three pressors to maintain his blood pressure.  On
[**6-9**], he had a PEA arrest, but spontaneous circulation returned
after administration of epinephrine, atropine, bicarbonate, and
calcium.
.
Respiratory failure.  Patient developed respiratory failure in
setting of receiving fluid boluses for hypotension.  He was
ultimately intubated intubated for respiratory failure.

?Gastric outlet obstruction.  Patient had emesis with meals for
several days. A KUB shows significant gastric distention
consistent with gastric outlet obstruction, but this resolved
with NGT suction.
.
Syncope/ ?Cardiac arrest. Circumstances of the ?cardiac arrest
prior to hospital admission were unclear as there is little
documentation of the event. It was felt most likely to be vagal
event as it occurred while on the bedpan.  He reportedly
received 15 minutes of chest compressions, but had no fracture
ribs and did not receive medications during the "arrest".
.
Sick Sinus Syndrome.  Patient had history of tachy-brady
syndrome and was awaiting pacemaker placement prior to his
death.  All nodal agents were held during his hospitalization.
