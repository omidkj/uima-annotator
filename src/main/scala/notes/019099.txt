.
CXR [**2169-1-16**]: There is a dense area of pneumonic consolidation in
the left upper lobe. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
The right lung is clear.
.
ABDOMINAL U/S [**2169-1-17**]: The liver displays normal echotexture and
architecture without focal mass lesion identified. The common
duct is prominent measuring 1 cm in greatest axial dimension,
not appreciably changed since [**2166**]. Minimal intrahepatic ductal
dilitation is suggested. The gallbladder is not visualized
consistent with previous cholecystectomy. There is no right
upper quadrant ascites. There is no hydronephrosis within the
right kidney. The main portal vein is patent with normal
hepatopetal flow. The pancreas is atrophied with the tail not
well visualized given overlying bowel gas.
.
CXR [**2169-1-17**]: Left-sided opacity may be pleural or extra-pleural
in location. This could possibly represent a loculated fluid
collection or an empyema. Recommend chest CT for further
evaluation.
.
CT CHEST [**2169-1-17**]: 1. Left upper lobe consolidation without chest
wall invasion likely representing bacterial pneumonia. Followup
to resolution with chest radiograph is recommended. Should the
radiographic findings not resolve, additional evaluation with
chest CT would not be required. 2. Unchanged pulmonary nodules
since [**2165**].

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old female with DM and chronic pain presenting with
increasing malaise, fever, and cough, found to have pneumonia.
.
# PNA: Given recent hospitalization [**2168-12-16**], LUL consolidation
initially treated as healthcare associated pneumonia with
Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro, then Vanc/Levo/Flagyl. Symptoms improved on
antibiotics with no sputum cultures available although urine
legionella Ag and MRSA screen both negative. Influenza DFA
initially read as positive but subsequent changed to negative.
Abx narrowed to levofloxacin with continued improvement. Pt to
complete a 5-day course of high-dose levofloxacin.
.
# Tachycardia: Resolved over hospital course, likely in setting
of dehydration and infection. PNA treated as above and IV fluids
given with subsequent encouragement of po hydration.
.
# Hyponatremia: Likely [**3-12**] hypovolemic, resolved with fluids.
.
# DM: Poorly controlled with HbA1C 10.4. NPH regimen decreased
to 45 units in AM and 35 units in PM [**3-12**] poor po intake. Pt to
follow up with PCP.
.
# Peripheral neuropathy: Question of whether pt had
hallucination night prior to admission as reported by children
although only "laughing in my sleep" per pt. Of note, h/o AMS
and respiratory depression with too many pain meds as well as
narcotic dependence. Continued on naproxen and desipramine, and
oxycontin restarted given improvement in respiratory and mental
status improved
.
# Anxiety: Restarted on outpatient ativan dose when mental
status returned to baseline.
.
# Pruritus: Idiopathic per pt. Outpatient hydroxyzine can be
restarted prn as mental status back to baseline.
.
# [**Female First Name (un) 564**] intertrigo: Treated with miconazole.
.
# Dyslipidemia: C/w statin
.
# Migraines: Pt not c/o headache during admission.
.
# Depression: Stable, Duloxetine continued.
.
# SW: PCP to refer pt to CRS re: medication costs.
