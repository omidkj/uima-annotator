Brief Hospital Course:
85 y/o F with hx of diastolic CHF (LVEF >55%), AF, dysphagia
with a G-tube, recent pneumonia and MICU hospitalization and
type B aortic dissection being medical managed who presents from
rehab with worsening respiratory status, pneumonia and sepsis.
.
# Pneumonia/Sepsis: Patient arrived intubated and sedated and on
norepinephrine and phenylephrine infusions.  She was initially
treated empirically with vancomycin, zosyn and flagyl.  Her
prior PICC was removed and pressors were weaned.  Sputum
cultures grew Klebsiella, and her vancomycin and flagyl was
stopped.  She developed a rash and zosyn was suspected, so she
was switched to cefepime.  She developed a different rash on
cefepime, so she was switched to meropenem and a new PICC was
placed.  She completed an 8 day course of antibiotics (zosyn,
cefepime, meroepenem) for HCAP.  A second sputum culture grew
Stenotrophomonas suseceptible to bactrim and she was started on
bactrim DS 2 tabs [**Hospital1 **] with a planned 14 day course, last day
[**2113-4-7**].

# Pneumothorax.  She was initially extubated on [**2113-3-24**] without
complications.  That night, she became acutely hypoxic and was
emergently reintubated.  CXR demonstrated left pneumothorax and
a chest tube was placed by thoracic surgery.  Subsequent chest
x-ray showed complete reexpansion.  She was extubated again and
the chest tube was removed on [**2113-3-26**] without complication.
.
# Dysphagia/aspiration risk: Patient has had a long history of
dysphagia and receives feeding through a g-tube. She received
oral care q 4 hours, and frequent oral suctioning. Speech and
swallow services was consulted and final recommendations are
attached.
.
# Diarrhea: Patient had diarrhea on arrival and was covered with
IV flagyl. Subsequent stool c. diff antigen was negative x 2 and
flagyl was stopped.
.
# Hypertension: Patient arrived hypotensive and home
antihypertensives were held.  As her blood pressure increased,
she was restarted on antihypertensives and was on amlodipine 5mg
PO daily and lisinopril 20mg PO daily on discharge.
.
# Type B Dissection: No further workup.  Hypertension was
managed as above.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Metoprolol was held throughout this
hospitalization given hypotension and HR < 70.  She was
continued on her home aspirin 81mg PO daily.  She was not
treated with systemic anticoagulation given h/o GI bleed.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued home levothyroxine
.
# Macular Degeneration: Patient was continued home eye drops.

.
# Anemia: remained at baseline (~30) throughout this
hospitalization.
