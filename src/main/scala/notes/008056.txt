CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Diverticulitis, renal cell carcinoma of the
right kidney.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66 year old
gentleman who while being worked up for diverticulitis was
also found to have a mass of the inferior pole of the right
kidney.  He also complains of recent loss of weight.

disease; 2.  Recurrent diverticulitis; 3.  Depression; 4.

Klonopin .5 mg t.i.d.; Neurontin 400 mg b.i.d.; Colace 600 mg
q.h.s.; Flovent 2 puffs b.i.d.; Albuterol 2 puffs prn.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent an elective
sigmoidectomy with colocolonic anastomosis on [**2126-3-22**].
An abscess on the lateral pelvic sidewall was also discovered
at this time.  He also underwent a right partial nephrectomy
for right kidney tumor.  He tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the regular floor postoperatively.  He
required aggressive chest physiotherapy because of his
extensive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  On
postoperative day #2 he was found to have low oxygen
saturation.  On examination he had coarse breathsounds and
decreased breathsounds at the bases.  Chest x-ray was
consistent with right lower lobe collapse and infiltrate.  At
this point for aggressive pulmonary toileting he was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he received
aggressive chest physiotherapy.  His pulmonary condition
slowly improved over time.  On postoperative day #3 he was
transferred back to the regular floor after improvement in
his pulmonary status.  His subsequent postoperative course
was unremarkable.  He was started on p.o. with passage of
flatus.  He is now tolerating a regular diet and we
anticipate discharge to rehabilitation.  His pulmonary status
is improved from before.
