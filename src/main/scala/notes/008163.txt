[**2101-7-24**] Cardiac Cath
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated severe coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 80%
complex
area of stenosis. The LCX had 95% stenosis at its origin and a
90%
stenosis at its mid portion. The mid LAD had 30% stenosis. The
RCA had a
40% stenois at its mid portion.
2. Resting hemodynamic measurement demonstrated elevated left
sided
filling pressure with an PCWP of 25 mmHg. The mean PAP was
elevated at
39 mmHg. The RVEDP was within normal at 11 mmHg. The calculated
Fick
C.I. was preserved at 2.5 L/min/m2

[**2101-7-25**] ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

[**2101-7-25**] Carotid Ultrasound
Bilateral heterogeneous calcific ICA plaque, that on the right
associated with an approximately 40% stenosis. That on the left,
unassociated with any significant stenosis (graded as less than
40%).

Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
An IABP is in the proximal descending aorta, just beyond the
subclavian artery.

Post-CPB:
Patient is AV-Paced, on no infusions.
Good biventricular systolic fxn.
1+ TR, 2+MR, trace AI. Aorta intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Final Report
STUDY: Single portable AP chest radiograph.

INDICATION: Status post CABG with chest tube removal.

COMPARISON: [**2101-7-26**].

FINDINGS: Left-sided chest tube has been removed without
pneumothorax
identified. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable in appearance. No appreciable effusion or
pneumothorax
detected.

IMPRESSION: Removal of left-sided chest tube without
pneumothorax.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2101-7-24**] with chest
pain. A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed
severe left main and single vessel disease. An intra-aortic
balloon pump was placed for coronary perfusion.Heparin was
started for anticoagulation. Given the severity of his disease,
the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical
management. He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner
including a carotid duplex ultrasound which revealed a 40% right
and less then 40% left internal carotid artery stenosis. On
[**2101-7-26**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was
taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring.Within 24 hours he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. His IABP was also removed within 24 hours.

He was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strenght and mobility.Pacing wires removed on POD
#3. He developed urinary retention and foley will remain in
place with pt. to follow up with his own outpatient urologist.He
also went into A Fib and was started on amiodarone and coumadin.
Target INR is 2.0-2.5 for A Fib. Coumadin dosing to be followed
by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. First blood draw tomorrow [**8-2**]. Cleared for
discharge to home with VNA services on POD #6. Pt is to make all
followup appts. as per discharge instructions.
