Imaging:
========
CXR [**5-26**]: Markedly stable left lung consolidation relative to
the prior exam with may be slight improved aeration laterally in
the mid lung zone. Persistent small left pleural effusion as
well.
.
CXR [**5-27**]: Heart size is normal. Mediastinum is normal. There are
extensive consolidations in left lung, unchanged since the prior
study. Right basal opacity appears to be new and might represent
interval involvement of the right lung by infectious process.
Old right clavicular fracture is redemonstrated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26172**] is a 79 year-old woman with a history of COPD who
returns to ICU after one day at rehab with dyspnea and
hemoptysis vs. GIB.
.
# Pneumonia / Dyspnea: Patient was recently admitted for dyspnea
and found to have severe left side pneumonia in addition to
end-stage COPD. Underlying malignancy was also considered given
recurrent pneumonias since [**2111**], but this was not worked up
further given that patient did not want escalation of care on
previous admission. She was started on treatment for HCAP with
vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. She was discharged to a
rehab facility one day prior to this admission with the
intention of pursuing hospice care. She was readmitted with
hypoxemia and hemoptysis. Her O2 sats on admission were 78% on
room air, she was restarted on 5L nasal cannula and admitted to
MICU. She was continue on HCAP antibiotic therapy. During her
MICU course, palliatve care was reconsulted and we continued
zyprexa, ativan, clonazepam and dilaudid as needed to control
her symptoms of dyspnea. Her O2 sats were 88-92% on 5L. We spoke
to the family and patient at length and the patient prefers no
escalation of care and to be comfortable. She was continued on
nebulizers and prednsione, in addition to the symptomatic care
as above.   She came to the floor and did well for a few days,
but then started to develop severe symptomatic air hunger.  She
was given IV dilaudid and ativan.  Palliative care was following
and hospice benefit was initiated.  She was transitioned to
dilaudid drip for intermittent bouts of anxiety and awareness
with severe air hunger.  She passed away 1125 am [**2112-6-1**].
.
# Hemoptysis / anemia: Patient has had ongoing hemoptysis likely
in the setting of her pneumonia, COPD and possible underlying
malignancy. Her HCT was 25.1 on discharge two days ago and was
17.1 on readmission. She was given 1U RBCs and her HCT improved
to 28.9, so initial HCT was likely spurious. She had scant
hemoptysis and no melenic stool while in MICU. Her HCT remained
stable, and the given goals of care, we no longer checked labs..
.
#COPD: Gold stage IV on home O2.  Patient was previously treated
for COPD exacerbation with prednisone 60 mg daily for 5 days
during last admission. She was tapered down to her home dose of
35mg daily which is being continued. She was given standing
nebulizer treatment with goal O2 sats 89-92%.  We stopped these
when she changed her goals of care
.
#Insomnia/anxiety/recent stressers: Patient recently lost
husband (came from his funeral on prior admission). Social work
and palliative care have been following. She was continued on
her anxiolytic regimen of ativan, clonazepam and zyprexa as her
O2 sats drop during frequent episodes of anxiety.  This was
continued with IV ativan through to her passing.
