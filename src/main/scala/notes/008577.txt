Chest pain, nausea, vomiting

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 67 y/o with PMH of CAD s/p MI [**8-/2189**], h/o UGIB,
DM, hyperlipidemia, AS and CHF (EF 25%) who presented to OSH
today with nausea and vomiting as well as chest pain.  Per the
patient's wife the patient was very tired today, with decreased
appetite and poor energy.  He took oxycodone for L rib fracture
pain and immediately began vomiting.  He continued to feel tired
and seemed "out of it" to his wife who then brought him into the
[**Name (NI) **].  Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2-3**] after a fall on [**1-31**] which he slipped on ice.  He sustained
L-sided 7th-9th rib fractures.  He has had ongoing L-sided CP
since he was discharged yesterday.

In OSH ED initial VS were T 99.4, HR 110, BP 86/62, RR 24, 94%
RA.  Pt reportedly looked lethargic and pale.  Initial labs
revealed Trop 17.93, CK 1756 and MB 225.  EKG showed sinus tach,
LVH, and worsened ST depressions in V4-V6.  He was given zofran
4mg IV x 1, dilaudid  1mg IV x 2, and ASA 325mg PO x 1.  After
discussion with covering cardiologist he was also started on hep
gtt and given lopressor 2.5mg IV x 1. CTA was performed which
showed known rib fractures and L pleural effusion, neg. for PE.
Given elevated CE he was transferred to CCU for further
management.

On arrival to the CCU the patient was sleepy but alert.  He
complained of intermittent chest pain, however he was unable to
qualify whether this was different than his rib fx. pain.  Pt
was continued on Heparin gtt 1000u/hr. He was maintained on 100%
NRB satting in high-90s. Labs were sent, and were notable for a
bump in Cr (1.9 at OSH->2.5).

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism.  He reports a
history of bleeding on heparin (colonic AVM source requiring 17
units blood).  He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. The
patient denies any melena, rectal bleeding, or transient
neurologic deficits.  No change in weight, bowel habit or
urinary symptoms. No  arthralgias, myalgias, headache or rash.
All other review of systems  negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for + chest pain.  Patient
has  dyspnea on significant exertion, however denies paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION - [**2190-2-7**]
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed multi-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
without
significant stenoses.  The LAD had a 60% mid-vessel stenosis.
D1 had a
70% stenosis.  The LCX and Ramus each had 70% stenoses.  A small
OM
branch was occluded and a second OM had a 70% stenosis.  The RCA
was
occluded proximally with left-to-right collaterals.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated
biventricular filling pressures, with an RVEDP of 20mmHg and a
mean PCWP
of 36 mmHg (before lasix given).  The mixed venous 02 saturation
was 48,
giving a cardiac output of 4.0 and a cardiac index of 1.8,
indicating
cardiogenic shock prior to placement of the IABP.  The aortic
valve
gradient was 22, yielding a valve area of 0.9, indicating
moderate-to-severe AS.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Cardiogenic shock.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM - [**2190-2-7**]
Focused study by on call fellow. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 15 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Significant aortic stenosis
is present (not quantified). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT ABD/PELVIS - [**2190-2-14**]
1. Moderate left pleural effusion with subjacent atelectasis.
2. No evidence for intra-abdominal abscess or acute
intra-abdominal
pathology.
3. Very mild edema in subcutaneous tissues of bilateral thighs.
No loculated fluid collections are identified.
4. Displaced fractures of the left seventh, eighth, and ninth
ribs, which
appear to be acute.
5. Nonobstructive subcentimeter bilateral renal calculi. No
hydronephrosis.
