No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm,
non-mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is a moderate-sized
vegetation on the aortic valve. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Presented to emergenct department with mal functioning PICC line
which he was receiving naficillin and TPN.  He was admitted for
shortness of breath and echocardiogram revealed worsening aortic
insufficiency.  He completed his course of naficillin for
endocarditis and underwent preoperative workup for AVR.  He
remained in TPN for nutrition as recommended by GI.  He was
found to have dental issues and OMFS was consulted and he had
teeth extraction prior to AVR.  On [**9-10**] he was brought to the
operating room and underwent aortic valve replacement.  See
operative report for further details.  He received vancomycin
for perioperative antibiotics and he was transfer to the
intensive care unit for post operative management.  In the first
twenty four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke and was
extubated without complications.  He was resumed on TPN
postoperatively and was transitioned to TPN at night and oral
diet during the day.  On postoperative day one he was
transferred to the floor for the remainder of his care.  He did
develop atrial fibrillation and was started on amiodarone and
coumadin for anticoagulation.  He continued to progress and
worked with physical therapy.  Nutrition he tolerated oral diet,
and tpn continued at night however he declined TPN at discharge,
GI aware, and plan to monitor nutritional intake and he will add
supplements in during day.  He was ready for discharge with no
services per his request on post operative day 11.  Plan for
follow up with GI, Cardiology, and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in next week.
Cardiac surgery office will monitor and dose coumadin until
return to [**Country 5881**].
