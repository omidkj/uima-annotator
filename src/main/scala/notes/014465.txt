Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was admitted to the cardaic surgery service, had urology
service evaluation who ultimately cleared him to have MV
surgery.  He was started on Cipro for a UTI, given vitamin K for
an elevated INR, and underwent CT scans to r/o metastatic
disease (which was negative).  He was taken to the OR on [**2161-8-11**]
when he underwent a tissue ([**Company 1543**] Mosaic, 29mm) MVR.
Post-op, he was taken to the CSRU on neosynephrine gtt.  He was
extubated the day of surgery.  He was transferred to the
telemetry floor on POD # 1.  The following day, he underwent a
swallow eval which revealed aspiration of thin liquids.  He was
therefore given thick liquids and soft solids.  His chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed, he began to progress
with physical therapy and ambulation.  He was started on
Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, and it was felt best not to
anticoagulate him at this time due to his recent bladder surgery
and intermittant disorientation and risk for falling.  The EPS
service was consulted, and the pt. was cardioverted on [**2161-8-13**]
which was unsuccessful, but he spontaneously converted to NSR
the following day.  His foley catheter was removed, and he has
been voiding freely, incontinent at times.  On [**7-20**], he was
noted to have an increasing WBC, with fever and abdominal
distention.  This was later accompanied by diarrhea.  A general
surgery consult was obtained, as well as abd. CT scan which
revealed colitis.  He was made NPO, and started on Vanco &
Flagyl for presumed CDiff colitis.  Stool was positive for
CDiff, and the patients clinical exam and symptoms improved
significantly over the next few days.
Subsequent swallow eval. has shown improvement, and he is
cleared to take thin liquids and soft solids PO.  He has
remained afebrile, with a stable WBC (13K), and is ready to be
discharged to rehab.
