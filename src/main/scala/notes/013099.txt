Final Report
INDICATION:  76-year-old man with difficulty swallowing, please
evaluate for
aspiration. No comparison is available.
TECHNIQUE:  Fluoroscopic guidance was provided to the speech and
swallow
department.  The patient was given various consistency of the
barium.

IMPRESSION:  Post-swallowing, aspiration and penetration of thin
liquid that
responded to chin tuck movement.

OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION

EVALUATION:
An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
today in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid,
Nectar-thick
liquid, pureed consistency barium, one-half of a cookie coated
with barium and one barium pill were administered. Results
follow:

NOTE: THE EXAM WAS COMPLETED WITH THE PASSY MUIR SPEAKING VALVE
IN PLACE.

ORAL PHASE:
The oral phase was noted for mild-moderate deficits,
specifically
with regards to weakened base of tongue retraction via the
posterior pharyngeal wall during the swallow. This contributed
to
the vallecular residue appreciated and tongue pumping and
piecemeal behavior was noted. Additionally, mastication was
prolonged with the cookie and there was mild oral residue with
solids on the tongue. The pt cleared this with repeat swallows.

Otherwise bolus control, formation and oral transit were judged
to within functional limits.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE:
The pharyngeal phase was noted for mild-moderately reduced
hyolaryngeal excursion with mildly incomplete epiglottic
deflection. As a result, there was mild-moderate vallecular
residue for both solids and liquids.

The pharyngeal phase was otherwise judged to be within
functional
limits for a timely swallow initiation with adequate velar
elevation, laryngeal valve closure, pharyngeal transit time,
bolus propulsion, and pharyngoesophageal sphincter. The 13 mm
barium tablet did pass freely through the pharynx, esophagus and
to the stomach.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION:
There was mild penetration after the swallow with thin liquids
due to spillover of residue into the laryngeal vestibule. This
was cleared with a cued cough.

There was mild/trace silent aspiration after the swallow with
thin liquids and nectar thick liquids due to spillover of
residue
into the airway. No reflexive cough was present, however cued
coughs were effective at eliminating subglottic aspirate
material.

TREATMENT TECHNIQUES:
A chin tuck maneuver was effective at eliminating aspiration by
significantly decreasing pharyngeal residue. The pt only
required
two swallows to clear residue from sips or bites vs [**5-5**] swallows
just for a teaspoon of liquid.

SUMMARY:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73145**] presents with a mild-moderate oropharyngeal
dysphagia primarily characterized by decreased tongue propulsion
and hyolaryngeal excursion which contributed to pharyngeal
residue and trace silent aspiration after the swallow with thin
and thick liquids. However, aspiration was prevented with the
use
of a chin tuck maneuver combined with double swallows for bites
and sips. The pt was able to swallow the pill whole for today's
examination, but it was difficult for him to combine this with
the chin tuck maneuver. As such, I would recommend the pt be
advanced to a ground solid, thin liquid po diet texture with
aspiration precautions. Additionally, pills should be given
whole
with puree textures, using the chin tuck. Aspiration precautions
and 1:1 assistance will be required at all meals.

This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 4.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Advance to a po diet texture of ground solids, thin liquids
with aspiration precautions. Additionally, pills should be given
whole with puree textures, using the chin tuck.

2. Pt will need to perform a chin tuck and swallow twice for
every bite and sip.

3.  Aspiration precautions and 1:1 assistance will be required
at
all meals.

These recommendations were shared with the patient, the nurse
and
the medical team.
