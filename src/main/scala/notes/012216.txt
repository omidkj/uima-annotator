Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Polysubstance overdose/suicide attempt

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
45 yo F c hx depression, borderline PD, multiple suicide
attempts in past. [**Name (NI) **] mother recently died and patient has
had decompensation of psychiatric issues. Pt had been admitted
to [**Hospital1 **] 4 for expression of suicidal ideation and discharged
approx. 1 week ago. Pt. then found unresponsive on [**8-6**] with
multiple Rx medication bottles and suicide note nearby. Suspect
overdose on ativan, seroqual, verapamil, inderal, trazadone,
clonidine, levothyroxine combination. Brought to ED, had 1
episode of vomiting enroute with concern for aspiration; she was
intubated for airway protection in the ED. Treated with
activated charcoal and levofloxacin, metronidazole IV for
possible aspiration pneumonia.
.
In MICU, pt required Levaphed and briefly Neosynephrine to
maintain her BP given her ingestion. She was briefly
Dexamethasone awaiting [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim although her BPs recovered
off pressors prior to this being performed. She was extubated on
[**8-7**] and sent to the floor after her mental status had returned
to baseline. She was seen by psych who recommended restarting
her psych meds.
.
On [**8-8**], around 11am, pt began to experience worsening SOB that
initially did not respond to nebulizer treatments. She had an
ABG that showed 7.32/35/175 and she recieved 20mg of prednisone
at 12pm. After several hours of persistant tachypnea, we were
asked to evaluate patient. A repeat ABG was 7.49/26/121 on 50%
face mask with visible respiratory distress, accessory muscle
use with RR in the 30s. Her VS 99.1, BP 172/94, HR 76, o2sat
100% on face mask as above.
Pt was transferred back to the floor after 24hrs in the MICU
where a trial of BIPAP was used in combination with regular
nebulizer treatments of albuterol and ipratropium. The patient
had a 3liter oxygen requirement, mild wheezes and complained of
mild parasternal tenderness worse with deep inspiration.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.

The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral

regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
CHEST, SINGLE AP FILM [**8-6**]
For CV line placement.
Endotracheal tube is 4 cm above carina. Right subclavian CV line
is in mid SVC. NG tube has tip located in body of stomach. No
pneumothorax. Since the previous film of the same date, there is
a new large area of right perihilar and right basilar opacity
most likely consolidation secondary to aspiration. Findings
discussed by telephone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23464**].
.
CHEST, AP [**8-8**]
A right subclavian vascular catheter remains in place,
terminating in the lower superior vena cava. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable. Bilateral asymmetrical
perihilar areas of consolidation, right greater than left show
slight interval improvement. Mild interstitial edema and small
amount of intrafissural fluid in the minor fissure are
unchanged.
.
CHEST, AP [**8-9**]
The heart size is normal. The mediastinal contours and position
are unremarkable. The bilateral perihilar interstitial opacities
have been slightly increased representing worsening of
previously demonstrated congestive heart failure. There is some
local improvement of the right lower lobe consolidation
representing most probably aspiration. There is no sizeable
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
The tip of the right subclavian line is at the level of the
cavoatrial junction.
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight worsening in pulmonary edema.
2. Improvement in the right lower lobe consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY IN BRIEF
Suspect overdose on ativan, seroqual, verapamil, inderal,
trazadone, clonidine, levothyroxine combination. Brought to ED,
had 1 episode of vomiting enroute with concern for aspiration;
she was intubated for airway protection in the ED. Tx c
activated charcoal and levafloxacin, metronidazole IV * 1 for
possible aspiration PNA.
.
In MICU, pt's mental status rapidly cleared. Required dopamine
to maintain BP briefly. Started on dexamethasone 4 mg q12
Quickly titrated off and BP recovered to systolic 150s off all
hypertensive meds. Extubated and transferred to floor, however
over the course of 12hrs pt had audible wheezing, elevated RR
depite, Q4nebs and 20mg Prednisone PO. pt was transferred back
to the MICU for an acute asthma exacerbation.
.
Pt was in MICU for 2d tx with BiPAP (1x 2-3 hrs) and frequent
nebs and continued prednisone 60mg daily. She did not require
intubation. Pt was transferred to the floor awaiting psych
transfer once medically stable. She c/o mild wheeze, but no SOB.
Some pleuritic chest pain at midline and at bases. Denies
fevers/chills. No N/V. Pt is currently not contemplating
suicide.
.
1)Respiratory:
Patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia with likely
post-intubation bronchospasm. She required a brief re-admission
to the MICU after being transferred to the floor for audible
wheezeing and signs of respiratory distress. With regular
nebulizer treatments every 2hours, Prednisone, and ipratropium
her respiratory symptoms stabilized. At time of discharge she
was off of prednisone, requiring regular albuterol treatments.
She does not have an O2 requirement at time of dishcarge. Of
note, patient had complete PFT's done and did not reveal pattern
consistent with asthma. At time report mild "heavy" sensation
along length of sternum, w
