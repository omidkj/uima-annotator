Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with mechanical ventilation [**2166-3-3**] - [**2166-3-4**]

History of Present Illness:
70 year-old woman with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic
restrictive lung disease/hypoventilation with some obstructive
component and sleep disordered components as well, on home O2;
presenting to ED with shortness of breath.  EMS was called to
her home today for worsening respiratory distress.  Reportedly
had sats in the 40% range and placed on a non-rebreather mask.
Nebs given en route.  Noted to become very lethargic with EMS.

In the ED, initial vs were: T96.8 112 160/78 30 97% on NRB.
Oriented x2 and noted to be lethargic.  Poor air movement and
intubated.  Patient was given solumedrol 125 mg IV, zosyn,
vancomycin, and started on propofol gtt.  High pressures
following intubation.  Was reparalyzed with vecuronium 10 mg x1.
 Changed to PCV, last setting FiO2 0.7, PEEP 6, peak pressures
40 with ABG 7.37/77/184.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient denies shortness of breath, chest pain,
headache, abdominal pain, leg pain.  When questioned does
endorse feeling unwell in days prior to ED presention - endorses
cough and diarrhea, no fevers.  Does not answer when asked if
wearing bipap at nighttime, but endorses wearing oxygen.

She was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 99865**] for altered mental
status.  She was found to have acute on chronic hypercarbic
respiratory failure but was able to be managed on NIPPV alone.

CXR [**3-3**]:
1. Endotracheal tube approximately 3 cm above the carina.
2. Large hiatla hernia.
3. Probable bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Stable cardiomegaly.

CXR [**3-5**]:
Given patient position, the radiograph is limited and difficult
to evaluate for interval changes. The endotracheal tube has been
removed in the interval. The patient position is grossly
unchanged.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax, areas of basilar
atelectasis cannot be excluded. There is no overt pulmonary
edema, but crowding of the vessels and minimally increased
vessel diameter could suggest increased pulmonary blood volume.
No evidence of interval recurrence of focal parenchymal
opacities suggesting pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 year-old woman with severe kyphoscoliosis and chronic
restrictive lung disease/hypoventilation, presenting with
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  The patient was intubated in
the ED and admitted to the ICU.  Acute decompensation was likely
multifactorial: CPAP noncompliance, CHF exacerbation (elevated
BNP, and overloaded on admission), COPD exacerbation, severe
systolic pulmonary HTN.  ECG at baseline and w/o rising CE
making ischemic event less likely.  She was treated with lasix
for CHF, steroids and nebs for COPD, and antibiotics for concern
for hospital aquired pneumonia with atypical coverage.  Patient
was extubated successfully without any complications and
maintained on nasal cannula and nasal BIPAP overnight.

# COPD Exacerbation: Treated w/short course of steroids,
nebulizers, and antibiotics. Will complete a 10-day course of
antibiotics with Levofloxacin.

# Acute on Chronic diastolic CHF (LVEF>75% [**1-/2166**]): Initially
volume overloaded. Diuresed with IV lasix with improvement in
respiratory status.  Subsequently restarted on her home dose
lasix and maintained on her home dose ace-inhibitor.

# Acute on Stage 3 CKD: [**Month (only) 116**] be [**2-11**] poor forward flow from Acute
on chronic diastolic heart failure (LVEF>75%). Euvolemic at
discharge.

# Anemia.  She was noted to have macrocytosis w/ boarderline B12
levels.  F/u as outpatient.

# Fever: Fever with Temp 101 on [**3-4**], but afebrile throughout
rest of admission.  Sputum, Urine, Stool cultures negative.
Blood culture no growth to date. HAP antibiotics started.
Antibiotics narrowed to Levofloxacin to complete a 10-day
course.

# Patient will go home with home VNA nursing services
