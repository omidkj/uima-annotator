History of Present Illness:
83 year old female with chief complaint of severe shortness of
    breath, cough and generalized weakness for 2-3 days.  Has
long h/o copd, pulmonary nodules (? NSCLC), and atrial
fibrillation on coumadin. Pt notes worsening shortness of
breath, myalgias, and general malaise over past 2-3 days with
subjective fevers. Cough is non-productive. Denies feeling
lighthead or dizzy. No chest pain or subjective palpitations.
She was seen in office by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 8706**] to have BP 98/62, p 140-160
irreg irreg, and O2 sat 79% RA, RR 28. Therefore she was sent to
the ED.

In the ED T 101.7, HR in 150, BP 112/86, R 24, 100% on
Non-rebreather
She was given 2 L NS bolus, 30 mg PO diltizam with improvement
in HR to 115 and O2Sats to 97% on 5L NC. Also given ASA,
combivent, solumedrol 125 IV x1. Started on levaquin 750 mg IV
x1, and ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x1 as CXR demonstrated pneumonia.

On arrival to the MICU the patient continued to have SOB,
although improved since arrival. Denied CP or palpatations.
Complained of insomnia.

CXR: FINDINGS: There is airspace consolidation at the left lung
base, consistent
with atelectatic changes, however, an underlying infiltrate
cannot be
excluded. There is post-ablation right middle lobe opacity that
is unchanged
from prior chest CT from [**2183-11-7**]. There is calcification within
the right
breast that projects over the right lower lobe lung fields. The
cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable in appearance. The visualized
osseous
structures are unremarkable. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. There is
blunting of the left costophrenic angle consistent with possible
small pleural
effusion. There is no evidence of congestive heart failure.

IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe patchy opacity consistent with
atelectatic
changes, however, an underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded.
.
CXR [**2183-11-27**]
IMPRESSION: Evidence of chronic lung disease including prominent
interstitial
markings and probable underlying emphysema. Slightly interval
worsening of
bilateral pleural effusions compared to examination of two days
prior.
Bibasilar atelectasis. No definite consolidation.
.
ECHO [**2183-11-28**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5
mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 y/o woman with increasing SOB and cough over last few days
presents with pneumonia and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
.
# Hypoxia: Patient's symptoms on admission, including dyspnea,
cough, and fever over past few days with myalgias in setting of
leukocytosis and CXR findings, were  suggestive of PNA. On
repeat CXR, a clearly defined pneumonia was less evident, and
chest film showed worsening of bilateral pleural effusions. Pt
was given Lasix 10mg IV x 1 with thought that hypoxia would
improve with diuresis, but clinical response was limited. Given
pt's initial improvement on antibiotics and high fever on
presentation, antibiotic coverage was continued. She was
switched from Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin to Levofloxacin 750mg
PO (initially q48 [**1-18**] decreased CrCl, now daily) as she started
having a mild transaminitis, thought to be possibly secondary to
the Ceftriaxone. She will be completing a total of 7-days course
(3 doses remaining at time of discharge.) DFA and Legionella Ag
were negative. Sputum culture was sent, but sample was
insufficient. Blood cultures are still pending.
    Given her history of COPD, and underlying flare was also
considered as a contributor to her hypoxia. However, she was not
particularly wheezy during her stay. Hence, steroids were not
continued beyond the Solumedrol 125mg IV x 1 dose in the ED. She
was continued on Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs. On day of
discharge, she was switched back to her home dose of Spiriva
with PRN Albuterol. She fluctuated between 3 and 4L throughout
most of her time on the floor, satting in the mid-90's at best.
She had a persistent cough that became more dry toward the end
of her hospital stay.
   It was also thought that pt's Afib with RVR was likely
contributing to the development of the pleural effusions and
associated hypoxia. Pt had HR in the 150s on presentation to the
ED, and HR was as high as the 120s on the floor. HR responded
favorably to fluid boluses. Pt's home Diltiazem Extended Release
was converted to qid dosing, and uptitrated to 90mg PO qid to
maintain HR in 70s-80s. Systolic BP was stable in the 90s-100s
on day of discharge. O2 requirement had improved from 4->3L on
day of discharge.
.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: It is likely that patient's
underlying infection and volume depletion contributed to her
RVR. Rate was much improved after IVF and po rate control
(diltiazem). First set of cardiac enzymes were negative, and was
not cycled as rate may cause slight demand ischemia with
elevation in CE's. Additionally, patient's other symptoms were
not particularly cardiac in origin.
    It was also thought that pt's Afib with RVR was likely
contributing to the development of the pleural effusions and
associated hypoxia. Pt had HR in the 150s on presentation to the
