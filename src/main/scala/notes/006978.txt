History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year old man with history of Diabetes Mellitus,
Hypertension, diverticulosis status post partial colectomy,
depression, CKD, vascular dementia, Parkinsonism, and status
post pacemaker who presented to the ED from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for
unresponsiveness. At 6:45AM, patient was noted to be in
respiratory distress, O2 sat was 91%, and was placed on NRB. A
nurse walking by had noted that he was tachypneic and called a
code blue. Pulse was recorded as 81, BP 100/50, O2 sat 100% on
NRB. ABG: 7.21/101/92. Glucose 242. Received Lasix 60 mg IV.
.
In the ED: V/S afebrile, BP 110/50, RR 20s on NRB O2 sat 91%.
Patient was placed on BiPAP. Nitro gtt was started for CHF but
SBP in 80s so it was stopped. Given hypoxia, concern was for PE.
Bilateral LENIS were done which was negative. Pt received
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levaquin. Head CT was neg. for
bleed. Patient was then transferred to MICU for further
management. Patient was non-communicative at time of exam and
history was obtained from medical record and from family report.

.
Of note, patient was just discharged yesterday from [**Hospital1 18**] for
hypoxia/CHF exacerbation. Patient presented on that admission
with SpO2 76% on NRB and an arterial blood gas of 7.34/66/53. He
was started on BiPap (FiO2 60%, PEEP 5, PS 10) with improvement
of O2 sat to 90-100% which was weaned over several hours. PE was
on the differential during this last hospitalization as he has
history of RA thrombus so TTE was done which showed no thrombus,
LENIS were also negative. He was started on Lasix and was weaned
down to 4L NC on discharge.
.
On review of symptoms, family denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He has a chronic raspy cough per the daughter.
[**Name (NI) **] of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations. Daughter is not aware of any dyspnea on exertion,
orthopnea. She has noted that he had ankle edema ("elephant
legs") in the late winter and early spring and had asked [**Hospital1 100**]
Senior Life to start the patient on Lasix. Daughter denies any
syncope or presyncope. He has poor functional capacity at
baseline.

gait, and confusion.
11. s/p hip fracture requiring ORIF in [**3-/2172**] with a

mental status has considerably improved.  Vital signs stable and
within normal limits (no further supplementary oxygen
requirement).  Alert and Oriented *2 (not to date) and

others.  Conversational.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.

<b>RADIOLOGY<B>
===============
CT HEAD on [**2173-8-16**]
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial pathology. Atherosclerotic disease and old
lacunar-type infarcts as described above.
.
CT Chest on [**2173-8-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Technically limited CT due to submaximal inspiratory level
and respiratory motion. No substantial change in atelectasis
involving the majority of right lower lobe adjacent to an
elevated right hemidiaphragm. High-attenuation foci peripherally
could potentially represent aspirated barium if the patient has
had a prior oral contrast examination.
2. No short interval change in pseudoaneurysm since recent CTA.

<B>OTHER STUDIES<b>
Video Swallow Study [**2173-8-20**]:
SUMMARY:
Pt presents with mild-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia as
described above.  There was premature spillage of liquids and
swallow initiation delay which resulted in silent aspiration of
thin liquids before and during the swallow and laryngeal
penetration of nectar thick liquids during the swallow.  Pt was
not sensate to aspiration and did not produce spontaneous cough.

Treatment techniques were not effective in reducing penetration
or aspiration.  Pt also presented with prolonged mastication of
solids.  This represents a decline in swallow function since
pt's
most recent videoswallow study, performed on [**2173-6-2**] while pt
was
at [**Hospital6 459**].

Based on these deficits, I recommend a PO diet of ground solids
and nectar thick liquids at this time.  Pt should have PO meds
whole in puree.  Pt is still at risk for intermittent aspiration
with nectar thick liquids due to laryngeal penetration, though
it
was not observed on our study.  However, I believe it is worth
trialing this diet in hopes that these restrictions will have a
positive effect on pt's respiratory symptoms.  If there is
continued concern for aspiration on this diet, repeat
videoswallow study is recommended with consideration of further
restricting pt's liquid intake.

This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 4, mild-moderate dysphagia.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO diet: ground solids, nectar thick liquids
2. PO meds whole in puree
3. Supervision and assistance with meals as needed to maintain
standard aspiration precautions.
4. If there is continued concern for aspiration on this diet,
repeat videoswallow study is recommended with consideration of
further restricting pt's liquid intake.

Sleep Study from [**2173-8-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
This was an abnormal portable polysomnogram.  There was
presumptive evidence of significant nocturnal
