Chief Complaint:
CP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PCI with angioplasty and DES to Mid-RCA

History of Present Illness:
68-year-old woman haitian Crecole speaking only with history of
type 2 DM, hypertension and hyperlidpedemia who presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED with 3 days of chest pain.  Patient reports that about
three days ago while she was putting her clothes in the laundry
she had suddedn onset of substernal chest pain with radiation to
her neck, right arm and her abdomen.  She attributed this pain
to indigestion.  The pain was [**4-16**] and remained constant.  Today
at 6:30am patient patient acutely worsened [**9-16**] associated with
nasuea, diaphoresis and shonrtess of breaht.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 45 96/45 16 100% RA.  ECG showed
ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction in inferior leads. She was
given aspirin 325 mg, plavix 600 mg, eptifibatide 180 mcg/kg x 1
and heparin 4000 units IV bolus. She was noted to be bradycardic
and hypotensive and thus given atropine 1mgx2 and started on
dopamine gtt which improved her blood pressure.  She was
transfer to Cath lab.
.
In the Cath lab, she was noted to acute mid RCA occlusion which
was treated with angioplasty x 3 (10 mm/12 mm/14 mm) with
residual thrombus which was exported and Promus DES was placed
in mid RCA.  His cath lab course was complicated by intermittent
complete heart block requiring temporary pacemaker pre-stenting
though she was conducting 1:1 in NSR after stenting.  She was
also noted to have AIVR.  Dopamine at 5 mcg/kg/min was turned
off at the end of her cath lab course.  A small 1.5cm hematoma
was visible at the RFV access site after the case, and manual
pressure was applied for 10 minutes.
.
In the CCU, she did not report chest pain, discomfort,
palpatations or shortness of breath.  She desnies any history of
chest pain.

Cardiac Cath
1) Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system
demonstrated three-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
mild
luminal irregularities. The proximal-mid LAD had an 80%
trifurcation
lesion that was tightest at the large diagonal branch takeoff;
there was
a high diagonal branch (functionally a ramus) that had diffuse
proximal
70% stenosis. The LCx was a diffusely-diseased vessel with a
likely
stump-occluded OM2 and severely diseased distal vessel; it
provided a
smaller left PDA.  The mid-RCA was 100% occluded without
anterograde
flow into the distal vessel; there was also haziness noted at
the AM
origin.  The ostial RCA had a 30-40% stenosis.
2)
3) During the procedure, and given the degeneration of the
conduction
disease to high-grade heart block associated with hypotension, a

temporary pacing wire was inserted through the 5 French venous
sheath
with successful capture at 80 bpm and [**7-17**] mA.  After the PCI,
pacing
was discontinued, and the patient remained in sinus rhythm with
1:1
conduction at a rate of 80 bpm with normotensive blood
pressures.  The
temporary pacing wire was therefore removed and the dopamine was

discontinued.
4) After the procedure, the 6 French right femoral arteriotomy
site was
AngioSealed with adequate hemostasis. The 5 French right femoral
venous
sheath was left in place in case of worsening conduction disease

overnight.  A small 1.5cm hematoma was noted after the
procedure.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Inferior wall STEMI with high-grade AV block.
2. Successful emergent primary PCI of occluded mid RCA with
PTCA, export
thrombectomy, and Promus drug eluting stent.
3. Emergent temporary pacing wire placement with active pacing
during
the procedure.
.
TTE: [**2144-8-3**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary
muscle dysfunction. Pulmonary artery hypertension.
.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2138**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

# STEMI: Patient with multiple cardiovascular risk factors
(uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension and
hyperlidemia) presented with worsening chest pain. ECG was
consistent with ST elevation myocardial infarction in inferior
