Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14037**]
Chief Complaint:
mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old nursing home resident with a
history of mulit-infarct dementia, alcohol abuse, pulmonary
hypertension, and CAD who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2184-1-2**] for
acute mental status changes.  He has dementia but is very alert
at baseline.  On the date of admission, he was unable to be
aroused by RN. Head CT done in the emergency department was
negative, LP was negative, but chest x-ray demonstrated
bilateral pneumonia. CT/angiogram showed left lower lobe
pneumonia, no pulmonary embolism, 1cm B hilar lymphnodes, as
well as severe emphysema. Was seen by PCP with plans to return
to [**Hospital1 1501**] on Abx, but he had progressive deterioration in his
mental status.

He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and required intubation for airway
protection on [**1-2**].  With the patient stabilized, MRI was
performed but did not demonstrate a new stroke.  The patient was
extubated on [**1-5**], had improved mental status.
The thought was that the patient's decline was due to his
pneumonia.

At baseline pt speaks, although sometimes has word finding
problems, uses [**Name2 (NI) **], dresses and feeds himself.

Social History:
Resident of Provident NH since a CVA in [**2180**].  He has a history
of alcohol abuse and unknown tobacco use history.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
VS:  T 98.9    BP 177/74  HR 86   RR 86  Sat 95% on cool neb
GEN: Man in bed in NAD
HEENT: PERRL, NC/AT, MMM,
CV: RRR nl S1/S2, II/VI systolic murmur
PUL: scant crackles at left base.
ABD: NT, +BS, no rebound/guarding
EXT: no LE edema, RP/DP 2+ b/l
Neuro: A&Ox person, month, day, "hospital".
CNII-XII intact, Motor [**4-1**] right.  [**4-1**] LUE,  4+/5 LLE.

Pertinent Results:
[**1-3**]:
EKG: Sinus arrhythmia
Borderline first degree AV block
Right bundle branch block
P-R interval 0.21
Since previous tracing, sinus tachycardia absent and axis change
seen

MRI/MRA Head: No evidence of acute infarct. Chronic infarcts in
the brain stem and posterior fossa with severe changes of small
vessel disease in the periventricular white matter with multiple
lacunes in the white matter. No midline shift or hydrocephalus.
MRA: The head MRA demonstrated normal flow signal within the
arteries of anterior and posterior circulation. No evidence of
vascular occlusion or high grade stenosis is seen.

Echo ([**1-2**]): Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic systolic function and mild resting mid-cavity
gradient. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No
definite 2D or Doppler evidence for endocarditis identified
(does not exclude if clinically suggested).

CT head: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral
edema. Note that MRI with diffusion weighted imaging is a more
sensitive evaluation for detection of acute stroke.

CT chest: 1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) Left lower lobe infiltrate, likely pneumonia.
3) Bilateral emphysematous changes.
4) 1 cm nodular density along right major fissure. This could be
infectious in etiology, but f/u chest CT recommended in 3
months.
5) Hilar and medistinal lymphadenopathy, which could be
infectious in origin.
6) Apparent tracheobronchial thickeening which could represent
chronic bronchitis or mucous.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo NH resident w/ h/o CVA and multi-infarct dementia who
presents with MS changes in setting of pna.

# MS changes: Etiology of altered MS was most likely secondary
to his infection/ sepsis, as LP and initial head CT were
negative and vit B12, RPR, TSH were nl.  Neurology was consulted
and recommended MRI, which showed no evidence of stroke. Pt's
neuro exam continued to improve with improvement of his PNA and
oxygenation. He was talking and increasingly oriented and found
stable for transfer to the floor.
Aricept, thiamine, folate were continued and sedatives
meds/narcotics were avoided.
.
# PNA with hypoxia: Pt was noted to be and hypoxic in the ED,
CXR showed impressive bilat PNA and pt required intubation for
airway protection. He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithro.
His PNA improved, lactate decreased and he was extubated [**1-5**].
Sputum revealed moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora; no
pathogens were isolated. He received aggressive suctioning and
chest PT. He will continue antibiotic treatment with levaquin,
500mg PO x10days.
.
#COPD: Poor air movement on exam and O2 sats in the 89-92 range
on 2L. Likely pt has severe emphysema at baseline. He was on
supplemental O2 with goal sats 89-92% and received RTC nebs as
well as 5 days of prednisone 50mg PO daily (day [**1-3**] on
discharge), with no taper.
.
# CAD: Pt was noted to have ST depressions in lateral leads on
EKG. Unfortunately, there was no prior EKG for comparison. Card
mkrs were cycled and he ruled out for MI. ASA was continued and
lopressor and captopril were added and titrated up to achieve
goal SBP 120s-130s.
.
# DM: Likely steroid-induced. Pt was kept on reg insulin sliding
scale while on prednisone. This may be discontinued in 3 days,
once he is off prednisone.
.
# Abnormal CT finding: 1 cm nodu
