History of Present Illness:
72 yo woman with lung CA, COPD, CAD who presented to [**Hospital1 2025**] ED with
worsening SOB. Patient initially diagnosed with squamous cell
lung CA in [**4-18**] with RUL mass. S/p XRT and chemo with
Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **] with substantial improvement in RUL mass therefore
patient underwent RUL lobectomy with improvement of symptoms.
Patient then returned to clinic with increased SOB in [**5-18**] and
found to have extensive mediastinal tumor encasing her trachea
and with narrowing of her esophagus. She had a tracheal stent
placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2143-5-16**]. Bronchial washings showed
recurrence of squamous cell Ca and the patient was started on
low dose Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **]. Patient found to have progression of
disease afer this therapy and was last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] on
[**2144-5-21**] who felt that the patient would not tolerate further
chemotherapy. No further oncologic treatment has been offered.
.
Patient presented to [**Hospital1 2025**] ED c/o sudden onset of SOB. Recently
had low grade fevers at home and mildly increased SOB from
baseline over past 3-4 days. On presentation patient was "dusky"
and NRB was placed with O2 sats 100%.  Patient also had
increased work of breathing and attempt was made to intubate x 2
in the ED. This was unsuccessful due to stenosis of the trachea
and therefore the patietn was taken to the OR for intubation.
CXR showed RUL consolidation felt to be a pneumonia and
therefore patietn received Azithromycin, Vanco and Gent. EKG
showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in lead III in one QRS complex with TWI
in V1-V2. Patient was bolused with Heparin and started on drip.
Otherwise VSS per report and patient transfered for further care
at request of daughter. [**Name (NI) **] spoke with PCP who then spoke with
daughter and decided no cardiac cath, but wanted medical
management with hope to wean from vent quickly.

Past Medical History:
-lung cancer in right upper lobe, ~4 years ago, treated with
chemotherapy and surgery
-neuropathy around lung cancer surgery scar
-diabetes, diagnosed in '[**29**], followed at [**Hospital **] Clinic

91%
-osteoarthritis of knees, hips
-polymyalgia rheumatica, 8-9 years
-macular degeneration, recently diagnosed
-s/p right cataract surgery
-hypertension, controlled with medication
- Mult ED admissions for hypoglycemia.


Social History:
lives with daughter, [**Location (un) 442**] subsidized housing, 2 ppd long
term smoker, quit for 6mth on own, now smoking again.


Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
VS: 95.6 (ax) 91/54  20  94% (AC 400/18 Peep 5 FiO2 100)
Gen: Intubated and sedated, minimally responsive on no sedation.

HEENT: PERRL, no scleral injection or icterus, elevated JVP to
mandible, neck supple
CVS: Distan HS, regular, unable to appreciate any murmurs but
exam imited by BS
Chest: coarse bronchial BS throughout, NO R anterior BS, lat
[**Last Name (un) 8434**] with mild wheeze
ABd: mild distention, NABS, soft, no masses
Ext: cool to touch, no mottling, pulses + by doppler
Neuro: arousable to voice, following commands

Pertinent Results:
CT Chest [**2144-6-23**]: Impression:
1. Interval increase in the mediastinal soft tissue extending up
to the hilum
and causing narrowing of the right and left main bronchi. There
is slight
improvement in the narrowing of the right middle lobe and right
lower lobe
bronchi.
2. Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions, very
minimal on the
right and moderate on the left.
3. New right lower lobe pneumonia, likely to aspiration.
4. Stable left upper lobe spiculated nodular lesion.
5. Stable post-radiation changes in the right lung.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 72 yo woman with NSCLC s/p chemo, s/p R upper lobectomy
with recurrence of mass surrounding trachea s/p tracheal stent.
Patient admitted with respiratory failure [**12-18**] COPD exacerbation/
progressive [**Hospital 4699**] transferred to MICU from OSH hypotensive and
intubated.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to COPD exacerbation and
progressive Lung CA now encasing her trachea. Most recent PFTs
indicate FEV1/FVC = 90 suggestive of concomitant restrictive
disease likely [**12-18**] to chest wall disease/infiltrative CA.
Patient with tracheal stent but now required intubation after
becoming cyanotic with increased work of breathing. Also CXR at
OSH showed R sided infiltrate, ?PNA vs. infiltrative CA vs. post
obstructive. Pt has elevated WBC with left shift suggestive of
infectious process. Sputum positive for coag + staph aureus,
likely MRSA. Patient still on AC but weaned O2 down to 40%.
Sedation was weaned with patient tolerating ET tube without
difficulty. However, careful ET tube care required since patient
very difficulty to intubate given tracheal constriction -
required surgical placement at OSH. Bronchoscopy performed in
the MICU showed obstruction of the L main stem bronchus which is
odd considering the patient's CA is on the right.
Atrovent/Albuterol MID continued via ET tube q 6 hrs.
Solu-Medrol for COPD exacerbation for 72 hrs. Patient was
treated with Levaquin initially, now only Vancomycin since
sputum growing gram positive cocci, coag positive, likely MRSA
given patient's history. Vancomycin dosed at 750 mg IV daily. CT
of the chest was performed to evaluate for interval change
regarding her lung CA and new infiltrate on CXR. This showed
interval increase in the mediastinal soft tissue extending up to
the hilum and causing narrowing of the right and left main
bronchi, slight
improvement in the narrowing of the right middle lobe and right
lower lobe
bronchi. Interval development of bilateral pleural effusions,
very minimal on the
right and moderate on the left. New right lower lobe pneumonia,
likely to aspiration. Stable left upper lobe spiculated nodular
lesion. Stable post-radiation changes in the right lung. Sputum
cultures also came back positive for MRSA and sparse GNR growth.
Patient was continued on Vancomycin with goal trough >15,
measured at 16. On [**2144-7-27**] patient went to the OR on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for removal of her tracheal stents with placement of a
Y-shaped stent covering both her left and right main stem
bronchi. This was performed successfully and patient was noted
to be easily intubated. Patient returned to the ICU and
continued on mechanical ventilation. She underwent several
spontaneous breathing trials on pressure support of [**3-19**] without
any difficulty. The decision to extubate her was pending
discussing with the patient and her daughter regarding her
re-intubation should she fail extubation. The final decision was
that the patient wished to be DNR/DNI and did not want a
tracheostomy. The patient's status was optimized for extubation.
She was diuresed to 1.8 L and weaned off sedation with a good
cough reflex. She was successfully extubated on [**2144-7-30**]. She
continued to saturate well with shuvel mask and then NC and then
on room air. She was diuresed further post extubation and then
started on her home regimen of 20 mg Lasix daily.
.
# CAD: Patient with 1 mm elevation in III, TWI in V1-V2 new
compared to EKG [**4-7**] and q waves in anteroseptal leads likely
representing an old anteroseptal MI but does not meet criteria
for acute STEMI. Cardiac enzymes negative x 3. Patient arrived
on heparin gtt later discontinued given lack of evidence for
acute MI. Patient hypotensive with BP 70s/40s requiring dopamine
with improvement in SBP to 100-120/50-60. s/p L subclavian line
placement upon arrival. Patient weaned off dopamine after first
day of admission with maintenance of BP with IVF. Goals to
maintain CVP >8, MAP >65. IVF NS bolus were given liberall
