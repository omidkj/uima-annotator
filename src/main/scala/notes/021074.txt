Chief Complaint:
Palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16063**] is a 75M with history of atrial fibrillation on
aspirin, non-small cell lung cancer status post neoadjuvant
chemotherapy/radiation and excision, ulcerative colitis, and
bladder cancer status post radical cystectomy and neobladder who
presents from an outside hospital with atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response. At the outside hospital, he received
IV diltiazem, and his rate decreased to 110s with blood pressure
to the high 80s systolic. Of note, he was admitted recently to
[**Hospital1 69**] from [**Date range (1) 16065**], during
which time he developed rapid atrial fibrillation to 140s-150s
in the setting of community-acquired pneumonia. On that
admission, he was transferred to the medical ICU after he became
hypotensive following 5mg IV metoprolol x3 for attempted rate
control. Given a CHADS score of 1 at that time, the decision was
made to anticoagulate with aspirin only in discussion with the
patient's son.

Through his son, the patient, who is primarily Russian-speaking,
reports that he was in his usual state of health until the day
prior to admission, when he developed palpitations. Upon
awakening on the morning of admission, he felt lightheaded and
dizzy and later developed an intermittent dull ache in his left
chest, radiating to the ipsilateral shoulder, [**5-21**] in intensity
and not reliably associated with activity. He endorses chills
without documented fever, as well as mild shortness of breath at
rest unchanged from baseline and without cough. He denies weight
gain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea/orthopnea, or peripheral
edema. He has been exposed to relatives with upper respiratory
symptoms, but has not himself experienced upper respiratory
symptoms and denies dysuria/hematuria; chronic diarrhea in the
setting of ulcerative colitis has been consistent with baseline.
His son notes that his father typically develops atrial
fibrillation in the setting of infection, however.

In the ED, initial vital signs were as follows: 97.2, 102,
104/66, 16, 98% RA. Admission labs were notable for lactate of
2.4 (down to 0.8 with 4L IV fluids), Ca of 7.1, Hct of 29.9, and
TnT <0.01. CTA demonstrated no pulmonary embolism or acute
aortic pathology, but did reveal post-treatment changes to the
left lung with trace bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
opacities, which may reflect aspiration or atelectasis/scarring.
He received diltiazem 10mg IV x2 and diltiazem 30mg PO x1. He
also was given calcium gluconate 1g IV x1. Vital signs at
transfer were as follows: 98.1, 115, 105/50, 18, 98% RA.

EKG ([**2154-11-23**]): Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Right axis deviation. Low limb lead voltage. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2154-2-7**] atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response has appeared and the axis is more
rightward.

CXR PA/lateral ([**2154-11-23**]):
Stable background chronic lung changes. Stable top normal heart
size with evidence of volume overload consistent with provided
diagnosis of
right ventricular regurgitation.

CTA chest with/without contrast ([**2154-11-23**]):
1.  No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.

2.  Changes of prior left upper lung and chest wall resection
due to non-small cell lung cancer with multiple enlarged
mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes concerning for recurrence with
bibasilar septal thickening potentially related to pulmonary
edema, with lymphangitic tumor infiltration is a less likely
consideration.

3.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar and
lingular opacities, which could reflect aspiration or an
infectious process. Due to nodular nature of the lingular
opacity, short term interval follow up (6-8 weeks) is
recommended, to assess for resolution.

Portable CXR ([**2154-11-25**]):
As compared to the previous radiograph, the post-surgical left
lung
is unchanged.  In the right lung, there is an increase in
interstitial
markings, notably at the lung bases and in the right lower lung.
 In addition, there is blunting of the right costophrenic sinus,
suggesting the presence of a small right pleural effusion.  The
size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. The findings in the
right lung might represent a combination of pulmonary edema and
pneumonia.

CXR [**2154-11-27**]
Patient has had left upper thoracoplasty, usually for
tuberculosis or lung cancer.  Heterogeneous opacification in the
right lung has worsened since [**11-23**], probably pulmonary
edema, accompanied by increasing small right pleural effusion.
