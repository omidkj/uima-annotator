History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 year old man who was moving mattresses with his
wife yesterday. [**Name2 (NI) **] he was was seated in a chair and he had
the sudden onset of blurred vision, and felt "as if [his] head
was swimming".  He stood up, then fell backwards, striking his
head on the floor.  He does not remember anything from just
prior to fall until EMS arrived.  He complained of  neck
stiffness and pain.  He takes coumadin for carotid stenosis with
prior cerebral infarct and he was given vitamin-K and FFP x 2
units upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].  CT head done showed blood inleft
lateral ventricle and neurosurgery was called for consult.

IMAGING:

CT Head ([**2123-12-28**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased intraventricular hemorrhage, involving the
occipital ventricular horns.
2. In comparison with the prior examination, the ventricular
frontal horns
appear slightly larger, with evidence of new areas of hemorrhage
along the
interventricular septum

MRA neck ([**2123-12-27**]):
1. Severe left common carotid artery bifurcation disease with
high grade
stenosis and long string sign of the left internal carotid
artery. There is reconstitution of the supraclinoid left ICA.
CTA is recommended for further  evaluation. The V4 segment of
the left subclavian is tortuous and narrow which may
hypoplastic with possible atherosclerotic disease.
3. Atherosclerosis of the right CCA and origin of the bilateral
vertebral
arteries but no significant stenosis.

MRI c-spine ([**2123-12-27**])
1. No evidence of fracture.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine as
described in
detail above.
3. At C6-C7, there is a disc osteophyte complex flattening the
spinal cord and causing mild spinal canal stenosis as well as
bilateral uncovertebral and facet arthrosis causing mild
bilateral neural foraminal narrowing

Carotid Duplex ([**2123-12-28**]):
1. Extensive homogenous plaque along the left ICA, with a very
high-grade
stenosis or near occlusion (99%). These findings are consistent
with MRI
findings from [**2123-12-27**].
2. 0 to 40% stenosis in the right ICA

CT head ([**2123-12-29**]):
Stable appearance of large intraventricular hemorrhage, with no
evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus or new bleed.

CTA chest ([**2123-12-29**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite pulmonary embolism. Smaller subsegmental branches
of the
lower lobes are slightly limited secondary to respiratory
motion.
2. Secretions in the left mainstem bronchus as well as bilateral
small lower
lobe consolidations, which are likely related to aspiration.
3. Emphysema, and a 3 mm lingular nodule. Given these findings,
a repeat
chest CT is recommended in 12 months in order to document
stability.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Minimal mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
6. Extensive atherosclerosis.

CXR ([**2123-12-30**]):
IMPRESSION:
1) Dense right lower lobe opacity and left lower lobe
consolidation concerning
for pneumonia.
2) Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
3) Mild vascular congestion compatible with previous CT imaging.


CT Head ([**2123-12-30**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in the size or extent of the
intraventricular
hemorrhage.
2. No evidence of obstructing hydrocephalus.

CT Head ([**2124-1-1**]): Little change in size or extent of
intraventricular hemorrhage.

CXR ([**2124-1-6**]): The current study demonstrates resolution of
previously demonstrated pulmonary edema. Heart size is mildly
enlarged, unchanged. Mediastinum is unremarkable. Left pleural
effusion is noted, at least partially loculated.  As compared to
chest CT from [**2123-12-29**], the amount of the pleural
effusion has substantially increased. Anterior consolidation,
better appreciated on the lateral view relate to left anterior
upper lobe pleural calcification.

CT Head ([**2124-1-7**]):
1. Appropriate evolution of the intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. No new foci of hemorrhage.

CXR ([**2124-1-8**]): Compared to the prior study there has been
interval decrease in the bilateral pleural effusions. These are
now only visualized on the lateral film and are poorly seen on
the frontal film. There is a subsegmental atelectasis in both
lower lungs. A 10-mm opacity seen in the left mid lung that was
not present on the film from two days prior or chest CT likely
represents confluence of shadows but attention should be paid to
this region on followup.

Discharge labs:

Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old male with history of Afib/flutter on coumadin, HTN,
stroke in [**2121**], and known carotid stenosis s/p fall on [**12-27**]
where he suffered a left intraventricular hemmorhage with a
hospital course c/b HCAP, atrial flutter with RVR and presumed
C. diff.

Active Issues:

#Intraventricular hemorrhage: Pt's INR was corrected to 1.2 with
FFP and Vitamin K for 3 days total after admission. A Cervical
MRI was obtained and ruled out ligamentous injury and his collar
was removed on [**2123-12-28**]. On that morning he was alert but had
emesis and went to CT for a repeat study which showed an
increase in ventricular hemorrhage with extension to the right
venticle. He was examined afterwards while he was getting his
carotid duplex as part of the syncope work up. He was lethargic
and had nausea but was otherwise stable. He was transfered to
the Trauma ICU for Q1 hr neuro checks. He remained
neurologically intact.  CT on [**12-29**] was without change and he was
trasnfered to the floor with Q2 hr neuro checks. He had a repeat
CT on [**2123-12-30**] which ruled out hydrocephalus prior to transfer to
the medicine service. Subsequent head CT on [**2124-1-7**], which was
ordered because Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained of worsening headache,
showed interval improvement of intraventricular hemorrhage.  He
was continued on Aspirin 325mg daily and heparin for DVT
prophylaxis, which was acceptable according to the neurosurgery
service.  His warfarin was held during this admission and will
be stopped at discharge.  We attempted to maintain
