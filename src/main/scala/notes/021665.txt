History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75361**] is an 81 year old male with newly diagnosed SCLC
with metastases to cerebellum, s/p 3rd ventriculostomy per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**10-29**], who presents with productive cough of thick
yellow sputum and headaches for one week prior to admission.
Family denies fevers/chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
dysuria. for three days. He reported a cough productive of thick
yellow sputum. He also reported ongoing [**10-16**] frontal headache
that has occured over the past week after initiation of
radiation therapy to brain.
.
Per neurosurgery note, patient had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea at
home. Head CT was reportedly unchanged, though bilateral
ventriculomegaly and cerebellar vasogenic edema was noted. Per
neurosrugery, no surgical intervention needed.
.
In the ED, his vitals were initially T 98.4, HR 100, BP 154/95,
RR 18, O2Sat 95% on RA. There was concern for a post-obstructive
pneumonia, so he was given vanco/zosyn/levaquin in the ED. He
later became tachycardic to 200s. He was given 10 mg dilt, 25 mg
dilt. He became hypoxic requiring a NRB. He was then intubated.
He was started on a dilt drip. He became hypotensive to 72/41 so
was started on a neo drip. He was cardioverted. Heparin was then
initiated. Neo drip was weaned in the ED.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75361**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC
with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted
with migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse s/p stent
removal, episode x 2 of a. fib with RVR s/p cardioversion in ED,
and headaches, admitted to MICU for respiratory failure and
unstable hemodynamics with atrial fibrillation, transferred to
floor once stable.
.
#.  [**Name (NI) **] PNA - pt was initially started on
vancomycin for post-obstructive PNA, showed downward trend in
febrile temperatures and leukoctyosis.  Patient had OR procedure
with interventional pulmonology for removal of bronchial stent
removal and tolerated procedure well.  Patient was extubated
without event or complication and was weaned from oxygen
requirement.  Patient was continued on albuterol and atrovent
nebulizers, transitioned to just atrovent inhalers. The patient
was oxygenating in the 90s on room air at the time of transfer
to the floor. He will complete a 8 day course of Vancomycin on
[**11-24**].
.
#.  Atrial fibrillation - pt had initial episode of atrial
fibrillation in ED, requiring cardioversion back to sinus
rhythm, then had second episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR
to 190s on [**2161-10-18**] after returning from OR for stent removal,
thought maybe precipitated by stent removal with cardia
compression.  Pt was started on iv dilt gtt, then transitioned
to amiodorone and esmolol gtts, transiently requiring
neosynephrine gtt.  The pressor requirement was transient and
patient was then continued on amiodorone and load with digoxin
(dig loaded [**11-19**]).  An echocardiogram showed no  pericardial
effusion with improved EF from prior and regional wall
abnormalities.  Pt has CHADS2 score of three, but given that
patient has brain mets and recent brain surgery, will not
anticoagulate him.  Patient cardioverted back to normal sinus
rhythm with amiodorone. Given his blood pressure having room
again once the pt was transferred out to the general medicine
floor, his metoprolol was restarted but at a lower dose of 25 mg
tid.
.
#.  Hypertension - patient has been hypotensive while in ICU in
setting of afib and his anti-hypertensive medications were held.
 Upon discharge from ICU, isosorbide mononitrate was started,
with hold of nifedipine and beta blocker. His BB and nifedipine
was restarted after transfer back to the floor. Low dose
lisinopril was also started.
.
#.  Brain Mets/Headache - patient presented with severe frontal
daily headaches associated with nausea and vomiting, thought
likely related to increased ICP, also noted to have bilateral
ventriculomegaly.  Neurosurgery evaluated patient and thought
low likelihood for malfunction.  Patient had been receiving XRT
and this was held during his hospitalization in the ICU.
Patient's dexamethasone was continued. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] of
neuro-oncology was asked to see the patient in house and......
-Will taper decadron to TID per last rad onc note in OMR
-emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3929**] of rad onc to see when XRT should be
resumed; also asked about length of decadron taper
.
#.  SCLC:  diagnosis confirmed by biopsy on bronch two weeks
prior to this admission.  He was s/p endobronchial stent
placement for palliation on his last admission, but as per above
the stent migrated and had to be removed this admission.
Patient has been followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] for his
transfusion dependent MDS, but he does not yet have a primary
oncologist for his SCLC (he was supposed to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] as an outpatient). Pt has overall very poor prognosis
with current condition and mets to the brain. The patient was
seen as an inpt consultation his last admission by
hematology/oncology who agreed with plan for XRT of brain mets,
and then considering chemo for his lung mass. The patient states
he does not want any chemo.
-heme/onc asked to reconsult on patient in order to give a
prognosis to family
-[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] of palliative care consulted via email
-pts PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was emailed and should be part of
discussion
-should arrange for family meeting with oncology, palliative
care, PCP (if able), SW, and primary team Tuesday or Wednesday
-SW consulted
.
# NSTEMI, CAD: Pt has a history of MI, EF 45% with RWMA, had
troponin up to 2 in setting of cardioversion, though no EKG
changes noted and rose again after prolonged tachycardia in
setting of a. fib.   Enzymes trended down.  Patient was
continued on aspirin and statin.   NSTEMI felt to be due to
demand ischemia in setting of Afib with RVR, PNA and
hypotension. His metoprolol was restarted when the patient was
transitioned to the medicine floor. Low dose lisinopril was
tarted.
.
# Chronic systolic CHF:  EF 45-50% on TTE this admission with
septal/apical hypokinesis. His metoprolol was initially held due
to hypotension, but was restarted once BP tolerated. Low dose
lisinopril was also added.
.
#  Chronic kidney failure, stage II:  creatinine remained at
baseline.  His medications were renally dosed.
.
# Code status: The patient was initially full code. On transfer
to the floor, the patient was changed to DNR/DNI based on
discussion between hospitalist and patient, son-HCP [**Name2 (NI) 2491**], and
pts daughter.
