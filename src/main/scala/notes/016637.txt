outside hospital with fever, productive cough, shortness of
breath, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after developing a visual field

***

Mr. [**Known lastname 87103**] was last well on Saturday night. He works in a bar
and was serving on for a large party. He had some beer and later
snorted some cocaine. He stayed out, getting home at about 6
a.m. and sleeping through until 2 p.m. when he was due to return
to work. He worked for about four hours before drinking two
beers and returning home. By the end of that shift he was
feeling unwell, with some chest congestion. He also felt
fatigued. Nonetheless, he slept well, waking at about 8:30 a.m.
on [**Known lastname 766**] morning (the timing of events varying slightly while
taking the history). He stood, felt light-headed and fell, with
brief loss of consciousness, but he recalls striking his head on
a table and his neck flexing or extending (in which direction he
cannot say). He did not suffer any superficial injury. He got
back into bed. By this time he was feeling even sicker, now with
some cough that became productive over the course of that day.
He also gradually developed a pounding headache with severe pain
that was in time with heart beats. He felt quite unwell, had
become febrile with chills and was fatigued. He ate nothing and
drank some water and CoolAid, but noted that his urine was
becoming darker. He slept very little that night. On Tuesday he
felt even less well, with continuing headache, fever, chills,
and productive cough. Again he slept poorly. On Wednesday he and
he and his girlfriend, who lives with him, decided that he
should go to the hospital. She drove him there.

In the OSH, atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate was noted and
diltiazem infusion started. Neurologic examination was not
performed in the OSH ED. He was noted to be diaphoretic, unable
to get out of bed, not eating, confused, but denied headache and
chest pain. Vital signs were 98.1 degrees, heart rate of 145,
repiratory rate of 24, blood pressure of 179 systolic. Right eye
blurring was noted. Oxygen saturation was 93%. Laboratory data
was significant for creatinine of 1.5, normal CK and CK-MB,
slightly elevated troponin I at 0.07. Bilirubin was also mildly
elevated. CT head was performed. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, right field cut restricted to the right eye was
recorded. CTA chest was performed and the patient was given
cetriaxone and levoquin, hydralazine given blood pressure of
175/123, aspirin and diltiazem. Urinanalysis was significant for
proteinuria, toxicology was positive for opiates and cocaine.
