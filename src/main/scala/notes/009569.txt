Date of Birth:   [**2096-2-6**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Location (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44-year-old Caucasian
female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma 15 years ago
status post chemotherapy and XRT, breast cancer status post
bilateral mastectomy, and a pulmonary embolism in [**7-28**] -
placed on Coumadin, colonic polyps, who presents with
dizziness, shortness of breath, and continued epistaxis.  The
patient has a history of frequent epistaxis since being
placed on Coumadin in [**Month (only) **] of last year, but states,
over the last day-and-a-half, her nosebleeds have been more
severe and constant.  She was recently evaluated by ENT on
[**2140-12-27**] with a fiberoptic exam and told that she had two
ulcerations in her sinuses which were the source of the
bleed.  They packed her nose and advised her to hold her
Coumadin for the time being.  The patient, also, reports a
recent ten day course of amoxicillin for otitis
media/sinusitis, at which time she presented with ear pain.
The patient, also, recently presented to her primary care
physician with complaints of shortness of breath with minimal
exertion and dizziness on standing up with a near syncopal
episode earlier this morning.  The patient, also, endorses
fatigue and, given the fact that she appeared dry and pale in
clinic, she was referred to the Emergency Department by her
primary care physician for IV hydration and a workup.  In
addition to these complaints, the patient also reports
shaking chills without fevers and an episode of melena in the
context of taking Pepto-Bismol.  The patient, also, endorses
one episode of hemoptysis on awaking this morning that she
related to her persistent nosebleed.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's blood pressure was
85/66 with a heart rate of 148.  The patient was given IV
fluids with a resulting blood pressure of 115/61 and a heart
rate of 115.  The patient's hematocrit was 27, white blood
cells 25, and INR 5.5.  The patient received a total of three
liters of normal saline and was admitted to the MICU.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband, two sons
and one daughter.  She denies tobacco or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.9, blood pressure
120/70, heart rate 130, respiratory rate 32, 100% on 40% face
mask.  General: A middle aged female in no acute distress.
HEENT: Nasal packing in place.  Mucous membranes slightly
dry.  No evidence of jugular venous distention on neck exam.
Chest: Left basilar crackles.  Heart: Tachycardiac, with  a
regular rhythm, I/VI diastolic murmur.  Lungs: Minimal
wheezing and left basilar crackles.  Abdomen: Normoactive
bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neuro: Alert and oriented
times three, otherwise nonfocal.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cells 24.6,
hematocrit 24.3, platelets 411.  Sodium 138, potassium 5.4
(hemolyzed), chloride 103, bicarbonate 23, BUN 45, creatinine
0.9, glucose 238.  PTT 42.7, INR 5.5.  CK 89.  Troponin less
than 0.01.  Lactate 2.9.

CTA: No evidence of PE.  Retrocardiac left lower lobe
consolidation, patchy peribronchial opacity through both
lungs - likely pneumonia, as well as a fatty liver.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 130 beats per minute.  Left
anterior fascicular block.  Lateral T wave inversions in I
and AVL.  LVH by voltage criteria.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Heme:  The patient was admitted initially to the MICU
with epistaxis in the context of a super therapeutic INR of
5.5.  The patient's anticoagulation was held and ENT was
consulted.  The patient received three units of packed red
blood cells in the Emergency Room and MICU with a noted
stable hematocrit around 28.5 afterwards.  The patient was
also admitted with a history of pulmonary embolism in [**7-28**],
of unclear etiology.  The workup at that time showed a normal
anticardiolipin and factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 12843**].  A further workup with
protein C and S and [**Doctor First Name **] was entertained, but deferred to her
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 3754**] was no evidence of pulmonary
embolism on CTA on admission.  The patient received an EGD
for melena and guaiac positive stools, which was negative.
Once her packing was removed, she was restarted on Coumadin
at her outpatient dose.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient was admitted with left basilar
crackles on exam with a chest CT significant for a left lower
lobe retrocardiac consolidation.  She was treated in the MICU
for community acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin, which was switched to cefpodoxime and
azithromycin PO on transfer to the floor.  Her CT was also
significant for opacities that, although were likely
consistent with pneumonia, were concerning for another
etiology in the context of her having nasal polyps and blood
in her urine on admission.  An ANCA was drawn and noted to be
normal.  The pulmonary team followed the patient on transfer
to the floor and had no further recommendations.  She will,
therefore, be followed as an outpatient in a pulmonary
clinic.  The patient was on a non-rebreather mask in the ED,
which was eventually titrated to a shovel mask and eventually
to a nasal cannula.  The patient had adequate oxygen
saturations on one to two liters per minute on oxygen by
nasal cannula on discharge.

3.  The patient was admitted with a history of an episode of
melena with guaiac positive stools on admission.  Although
this likely represents swallowed blood from her epistaxis, GI
was consulted and performed an EGD that was negative.  The
patient was kept on a proton pump inhibitor throughout her
brief hospital stay.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was admitted with a history of
hypothyroidism and was continued on Synthroid throughout her
brief hospital stay.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to home and is
encouraged to continue all medications as prescribed.
