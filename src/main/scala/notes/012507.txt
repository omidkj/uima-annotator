Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain. Right sided sensory loss.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
OPERATION:
1. Corpectomy of T1 and T2.
2. Fusion C7-T3.
3. Cage placement.
4. Anterior instrumentation C7-T3.
5. Autograft, allograft and bone morphogenic protein.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 48 y.o. woman with pmh significant for metastatic
thyroid cancer, s/p median sternotomy, T1 & T2 Corpectomy w/
T1-T3 Fusion/Cage, with subsequent bilateral pulmonary embolism,
being transferred to medicine for optimization of
anticoagulation. The patient presented on [**2142-11-14**] complaining
of right sided back pain, along with weakness and diminshed
sensation on the right side of her body. Imaging at the time
revealed tumor infiltration of her thopracic spine, and she
underwent median sternotomy, T1 & T2 Corpectomy w/ T1-T3
Fusion/Cage. Her post-operative course was complicated by
bilateral pulmonary emboli. She was begun on anticoagulation and
is now s/p IVC filter placement.

CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2142-11-13**] 7:41 PM

CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

Reason: please eval for progression of met disease, spine
integrity

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
48 year old woman with known metastatic thyroid cancer to T2 and
lungs with new b/l UE and LE 4/5 weakness and tingling and
numbness
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for progression of met disease, spine integrity
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 48-year-old female with metastatic thyroid cancer to
the T2 vertebral body and lungs with weakness and tingling in
the upper and lower extremities. Evaluate for metastatic
disease.

COMPARISON: [**2142-9-25**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the thoracic spine were obtained
without IV contrast. Bone algorithm and sagittal and coronal
reformations were performed.

FINDINGS: The extension of the lytic metastatic lesion,
primarily within the T2 vertebral body, into the T1 vertebral
body has increased in size in the interval. There is persistant
vertebral plana with a focal kyphosis of the T2 vertebral body
with more extensive lytic lesions of the right T2 pedicle and
lamina. The soft tissue mass along the right posterior aspect of
the T2 vertebral body, extending into the bony spinal canal
appears slightly increased in size, causing severe canal
stenosis. There has been slight interval increase in size of the
lucent lesion along the right superior endplate of T3 indicating
this likely represents extension of the metastatic lesion.

There are multiple scattered pulmonary nodules throughout the
lungs similar in size and number, consistent with diffuse
metastatic disease. Surgical clips are seen within the thyroid
bed.

IMPRESSION: Progression of osseous metastatic disease involving
the T1-T3 vertebral bodies with associated increase in size of
the soft tissue lytic lesion at the level of the T2 causing
worsened (severe) spinal canal stenosis.

An MRI would provide much better evaluation of soft tissue
extension and cord and nerve root compression.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: please evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
48 year old woman with metastatic ca to spine, presenting with
low grade fever and elevated WBC
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate for pulmonary infiltrates
TWO-VIEW CHEST [**2142-11-14**]

COMPARISON: [**2142-8-23**].

INDICATION: Metastatic cancer. Fever and elevated white blood
cell count.

Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Multiple
small nodules are present throughout both lungs, most prominent
in the mid and lower lungs, measuring up to about a centimeter
in diameter. In retrospect, a few of these nodules may have been
present on the previous examination but the overall size and
number appears increased. Biapical thickening appears unchanged.
No pleural effusions are identified. Known metastatic disease to
the upper thoracic spine is not well demonstrated
radiographically.

IMPRESSION: Multiple small pulmonary nodules, highly suspicious
for metastatic disease.
