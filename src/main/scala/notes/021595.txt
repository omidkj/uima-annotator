Brief Hospital Course:
71M with CAD s/p PCI, ESRD on HD, CHB s/p PPM, with GI Bleed,
s/p HD and 4U pRBCs on [**10-15**].
.
.
GI Bleed: He received a total of 9 units of PRBCs. His HCT
remained stable at 27. An EGD showed bleeding in the 2nd and 3rd
portion of the duodenum. He also had coffee ground emesis in the
stomach and a thickened area in the antrum. This was not
biopsied because his INR was too elevated.  He remained stable
with HCT of 27. He was continued on his aspirin and plavix given
his cardiac stent placed a month ago. However, after discussion
with his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that his
coumadin could be discontinued (was on it for aflutter s/p
ablation).  He was reversed with FFP and vitamin K to bring his
INR down to help stop the bleeding. He is scheduled to have
another EGD on Monday [**2144-10-19**] to bx the thickened
antrum and look for any residual bleeding.
.
ESRD on HD: Nephrology was aware and he received dialysis while
in house.
.
CAD: No evidence of NSTEMI with unchanged EKG and negative
cardiac enzymes. He was continued on his statin. Continued
aspirin and plavix as described above.
HCT goal was 30 given CAD.
PUMP: EF55%, held his BB initially given GI bleed and then
restarted once stable. Diovan restarted. Furosemide restarted on
discharge.
RHYTHM: complete heart block s/p PPM.
.
DM2: gave insulin per sliding scale
.
.
After discussion with the patient, the patient's PCP and the
MICU team, it was decided that he was safe for discharge with
close follow up.
