Allergies:
Serevent Diskus / Theraflu Multi Symptom

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty urinating, urinary retension and edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization [**2122-9-14**]
Peripherally inserted central catheter insertion (PICC) [**2122-9-11**]

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year-old Russian-speaking man with diastolic heart
failure, CKD, DM on insulin, asthma, atrial fibrillation (on
Coumadin), CAD (s/p CABG), h/o colon cancer, newly diagnosed
breast cancer (s/p biopsy 2 weeks ago), presenting with
abdominal distention, decreased urine output for the past two
weeks with urinary retention for the past two days.

His wife noticed increasing edema and abdominal girth
approximately 1 month ago. He saw his outpatient cardiologist
who increased his Torsemide dose from 100 to 150 mg PO daily.
Approximately 2 weeks ago, his wife again noticed increasing
abdominal girth and firmness as well, associated with decreasing
urine output. His cardiologist again increased his Torsemide
dose to 200 mg PO daily on week ago. His edema and decreased
urine output continued to progress, and he began to develop
scrotal edema. Two days prior to admission he was prescribed
metolazone 5 mg to be taken prior to dosing Torsemide. However,
he did not receive this medication. At this point he had urinary
retention, and his wife brought him to the emergency department.
Review of his medications from OMR revealed that he had been
prescribed Tamsulosin for BPH but he was not taking this
medication.

In the ED, initial VS T 97.5 HR 62 BP 99/49 RR 20 SaO2 96% on
RA. His creatinine was 2.6 which was an increase above his
baseline of 1.5-2. A Foley was placed, >600 mL of urine was
drained. A CXR showed vascular congestion and bilateral pleural
effusions left>right. An EKG showed atrial fibrillation with
ventricular rate of 63, RBBB, LAFB, unchanged from prior EKG.
Bedside US showed bilateral pleural effusions. Abdominal U/S
showed free fluid and no hydronephrosis, but scrotal fluid. He
was not given diuretics initially because of his elevated
creatinine.

During admission to medicine service, he was given furosemide 40
mg IV with good response. However, on the following day, he
failed to respond to furosedmie 40mg IV, so the dose was
repeated. The following day, he also received furosedmie 40 mg
IV BID. His fluid balance was even over these two days. The next
day, he was given furosemide 80mg IV in the AM, 2.5 mg
metolazone followed by furosemide 100mg IV in the late
afternoon. In the evening, he triggered for worsening shortness
of breath. He was given metolazone 5 mg with furosemide 140 mg
IV around 11pm. He was also given his nebulizers and one dose of
Solumedrol for possible COPD exacerbation. His O2 sats remained
>95% on [**1-22**] L/min O2. His CXR at that time showed bilateral
plueral effusions and vascular congestion. His net fluid balance
was negative 200 cc that day. Of note he also had two episodes
of hypoglycemia to 40s overnight accompanied by tachypnea and
wheezing; his respiratory symptoms resolved with euglycemia. His
dose of insulin had been decreased earlier that day because of
decreasing PO intake. His symptoms and hypoglycemia resolved
with dextrose. His insulin was further decreased to NPH 10 units
QAM and 5 units QPM with sliding scale. In the morning, he again
triggered for RR >30 and cardiology was consulted. Patient was
transferred to cardiology service for further management.

CHF (Biventricular diastolic, pulmonary HTN)
Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin
Chronic venous stasis dematitis left>right
Diabetic ulcers on heel and foot
Colon cancer(s/p Left colectomy '[**07**])
Atrial fibrillation (s/p ablation)
Gout
Asthma/Restrictive Lung disease
CKD Stage III, baseline Cr 1.6-2.0

Social History:

primary caretaker. [**Name (NI) **] is dependent for ADLs and uses a
wheelchair. Denies any history of smoking. Used to drink alcohol
occasionally but now he does not.

ECG [**9-3**]:
Artifact is present. Atrial fibrillation with a controlled
ventricular response. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch
block with left anterior fascicular block. There are small R
waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2122-5-13**] there is no significant change.

CXR [**9-3**]:
The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart
size is moderately enlarged but appears similar compared to the
prior study. There is mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with
perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness as well as
moderate-sized left and small right pleural effusions. Patchy
opacities in the lung bases likely reflect compressive
atelectasis. No pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute
osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure with small
right, and moderate-sized left, bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis.

Renal Ultrasound [**9-4**]:
The right kidney measured 10.5 cm. The left kidney measured 11.5
cm. Both kidneys show cortical thinning. No hydronephrosis,
stones or massesis are observed. The bladder is not distended
with indwelling catheter within it.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral renal cortex thinning. No signs of
hydronephrosis.

Echocardiogram [**9-4**]:
The left atrium and the right atrium are moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta and the aortic arch are
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Th
