Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxic respiratory failure
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Subclavian central line
Thoracostomy tube placement

History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with dementia, schizophrenia, HTN, DM presents to ED
after removing his PEG tube.

When he initially arrived from [**Location **] he was doing well.  Enroute
his vital signs were T 97.9 BP 128/70 HR 72 RR 20 O2sats 95% RA.
 He was sent to the ED for replacement of his PEG tube.  In the
ED he vomited and developed hypotension and hypoxia.  His sats
dropped into the 80's on room air and BP into the 80's.  CXR
then showed RLL/RML infiltrate.  He was found to have
significant bandemia and then was treated as code sepsis.  He
was given 3 L of NS with good response in his BP.  He was
continued on NRB with appropriate bump in oxygen level.  He was
also given Zosyn/Vanco for antibiotic coverage.

He is only able to respond with yes or no answers.  At this time
he denies ant chest pain or abd pain.  Otherwise unable to
obtain history from this gentleman.  I spoke to both his
guardian and son who were not aware he was brought to the
hospital.  They said at baseline he is only able to give yes/no
answers.

Brief Hospital Course:
77M schizophrenia, advanced dementia, initially presented for
PEG dislodgement, subsequently complicated by sepsis,
pneumothorax complicating central line placement, hypoxic
respiratory failure, ventilator associated pneumonia, ultimately
leading to withdrawal of care and expiration.

Briefly, the pt was initially brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for replacement
of feeding tube, however, his course was complicated by shock
thought to be [**1-21**] sepsis.  Pt underwent central line placement
which was complicated by pneumothorax requiring thoracostomy
tube placement.  In addition, pt's course was also complicated
by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, ultimately
further complicated by ventilator associated pneumonia.
Multiple attempts to wean towards extubation failed as a result
of 1) asystolic arrest, 2) tachypnea to 40s-50s, 3) agitation
and discomfort.

Given extended endotracheal intubation time, discussion was had
with guardian who felt that this was not according to pt's
wishes.  In addition, guardian refused further invasive
procedures as pt's clinical status continued to decline.
However, guardian felt uncomfortable initially with moving
towards comfort measures due to an isolated statement made by
the pt in the distant past.  Nevertheless, following a court
hearing, it was decided by all parties including pt's sons that
pt would not have wanted continued aggressive care given his
extremely poor quality of life and prognosis.

Pt was made comfort measures only and extubated.  He expired
[**2174-4-15**].
