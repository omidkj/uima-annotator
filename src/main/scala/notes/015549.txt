ART DUP LOW EXT RIGHT

FINDINGS:

Duplex evaluation of the right lower extremity arterial system
was performed which demonstrates a patent right common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal artery. Velocity in the right
common femoral artery is 112 cm/sec, with velocities ranging
between 70 to 87 cm/sec between the common femoral, and the
trifurcation.

IMPRESSION:

No stenosis seen in common femoral, superficial femoral and
popliteal arteries on the right.

[**2169-3-11**].

CHEST, TWO VIEWS: The heart size is within normal limits.
Mediastinal and hilar contours unchanged in the interval. The
aorta is slightly tortuous, unchanged. No focal consolidations
are seen. Again, seen is linear scarring at the left base,
unchanged. There is eventration of the posterior hemidiaphragms
unchanged. There is DISH again seen.

IMPRESSION: No CHF or pneumonia.

heparin for anti-coagulation. A pre - op note was done on
[**2169-3-29**]. All results evxamined. Pt cleared for procedue on the
[**2169-3-30**].

[**2169-3-30**]

Pt underwent a right lower extremity arteriogram via left common
femoral artery approach, with angioplasty and stent placement in
the distal right SFA, for
peripheral vascular disease with right lower extremity rest pain
and hypercoagulable state.

Pt tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.
After the procedure pt was transfered to the recovery room in
stable condition. When here ACT was around 180 her sheath was
pulled without complications. She remained on bedrest for 6 hour
after the sheath was pulled. After she recovered from anesthesia
she was transfered to the VICU in stable condition.

A post procedure check was done. It was found that the pt had a
hematome from the last admission. The pt was watched over the
next day.

[**2169-3-31**]

Pt still c/o foot pain post procedure. This coupled with  the
hematoma an US was ordered. The results as were a atent right
superficial femoral artery through popliteal artery
angioplasty/stent. There is a large left groin hematoma with no
pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.

Pt coumadin was started.

[**2169-4-1**]

Pt transfered from the VICU to the floor. Pt recieved a PICC
becaouse of poor access.

[**2169-4-2**] - [**2169-4-3**]

Pt anticoagulate with heparin and coumadin. She was mobilized,
her diet was advanced, her foley was removed. Pt responded with
good UO.

[**2169-4-4**]

Pt PLT count decreased from 200 to 89. Her heparin was DC'd a
HIT panel was sent. Pt still c/o toe pain. Because of the above
another ultrasound was done.

[**2169-4-5**]

The US  revealed no stenosis seen in common femoral, superficial
femoral and popliteal arteries on the right.

A pain consult was obtained for the toe pain. The pain service
recommended nuerontin.
Pt responded to the medication.

A hematology consult was obtained for her decrease PLTS.

[**2169-4-6**]

Hematolgy saw the pt.

[**2169-4-7**] - [**2169-4-8**]

Pt PLT improved, foot pain improved with nuerontin.

Case mangement and PT were consulted. Recommended that the pt go
home with no sevices needed.

[**2169-4-9**]

Pt [**Name (NI) 1788**] home. PLT stable, toe pain much improved, pt taking PO,
urinating with BM, ambulating well, INR 2-3 range.
