Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
BRBPR, tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
84M with h/o AF s/p ablation, HTN, admitted with syncope x 2 and
BRBPR. He states he was in his USOH until the night of [**9-12**] when
he had 1 episode of BRBPR and 1 episode of vomiting. He felt
very weak after getting up from the toilet. He fell and hit his
head on the floor but denies LOC. He denies associated
fever/chills, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, diaphoresis,
headache, visual changes, palpitations, CP, SOB. He denies
melena in the preceding days, stating he had normal BMs. He
states he had [**1-10**] more episodes of BRBPR during the night. He
woke up this AM feeling very week and fell again in the kitchen.
He denies head trauma and LOC with this episode. He again denies
lightheadedness, N/V, CP, SOB, headache, urinary incontinence,
and tongue-biting.
.
In the ED, his BP was stable but his HR was 110s-140s. He
received IVF and 1U PRBC. Abdominal exam was benign, but rectal
showed frank blood. His ECG showed lateral ST depressions, 1st
set of enzymes negative. CT head and C-spine were negative, and
his C-collar was removed. GI was consulted. He was admitted to
the MICU for close monitoring.
.
Currently, he states he feels well. He denies lightheadedness,
abdominal pain, N/V, CP, SOB. Occasionally uses Excedrin (1x/wk
per pt), no aspirin. No history of liver disease. Has never had
a colonoscopy.

.
[**9-13**] CT C-spine
CT C-SPINE: No fracture is identified. No subluxation is seen.
There is degenerative change, including anterior and posterior
osteophyte formation, predominantly at the C5/6 levels. There is
slight anterior widening of the C4/5 intervertebral disc space,
without any evidence of prevertebral soft tissue swelling. There
is limited evaluation of intrathecal contents on CT, however,
the contour of the thecal sacs is within normal limits.

Within the lung apices, there is fibrotic change bilaterally,
without any evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

There is an 8 mm focus of soft tissue adjacent to the posterior
wall of the trachea (series 2, image 58). This is approximately
5 cm below the glottis.

IMPRESSION:

1. No fracture or subluxation is seen. Degenerative changes are
seen at several levels.

2. There is an 8 mm soft tissue density adjacent to the
posterior wall of the trachea, approximately 5 cm below the
glottis. This may represent mucous, though this could also
represent a polypoid lesion arising off the wall, and further
nonemergent evaluation is recommended.
.
[**9-13**] CXR
SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac and mediastinal contours
appear stable. Again seen is evidence of vascular engorgement
with prominent interstitial opacities bilaterally, improved from
prior. No focal consolidations identified. No evidence of
pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Improving interstitial opacities again seen
consistent with improving CHF. No focal consolidations
identified.
.
[**9-13**] CT Head
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No intracranial hemorrhage is
identified. The ventricles are symmetric, and there is no shift
of normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. There is linear hyperdensity
within the right frontal region, which likely represents streak
artifact. No intracranial mass effect is seen. The soft tissues
are within normal limits. The paranasal sinuses are well
aerated. No fractures are identified.

IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is
identified.
.
[**9-13**] XR abdomen
FINDINGS:

Bowel gas pattern is nonspecific and nonobstructed with no
evidence for free air, ascites or pneumatosis. Calcifications in
left pelvis are most consistent with phleboliths.
.
[**9-16**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%), without regional wall
motion abnormalities. Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an
E/e' <8
suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure (<12mmHg).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function.
.
[**9-17**] CT sCT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The previously identified
soft tissue density in the posterior aspect of the trachea near
the thoracic inlet is not seen today, however, there is a focus
of slight tracheal wall thickening in the right posterolateral
aspect.

Multiple small lung nodules are seen throughout the lungs; the
largest is in the posterior right lower lobe (series 3, image
30), which has a hazy and distinct halo measuring approximately
8 mm. A similar finding is seen in the left lower lobe
posteromedial aspect, measuring 6 mm. No pleural effusion or
pericardial effusion is seen. There
