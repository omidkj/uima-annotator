s/p fall

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 y/o man who had a fall from a ladder after presumed
syncopal episode. Per OSH reports, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was working on a
ladder, complained of light headedness and fell approximately
[**4-24**] feet. He was alert and oriented initially, but vomited three
times en route to OSH, where he had a GCS of 10.  He was then
intubated for airway protection, and prepared for [**Location (un) **] to
[**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival here, head CT was performed revealing a
significant right SDH and basilar skull fracture.

Pertinent Results:
CT C-spine [**2133-1-14**]
1. No fracture or malalignment involving the cervical spine.
2. Multilevel degenerative change most prominent at the level of
C6-C7 with loss of intervertebral disc height, posterior
disc-osteophyte complex, facet arthrosis and uncovertebral
hypertrophy resulting in mild-to-moderate central canal stenosis
and neural foraminal narrowing. This predisposes the patient to
spinal cord injury with minimal trauma, and MRI of the cervical
spine should be considered for further evaluation of cord injury
if clinically indicated.
3. Basilar skull fracture involving the left occipital bone
extending to
involve the left occipital condyle and the left internal carotid
canal within the petrous portion of the left temporal bone.
Recommend CTA for further evaluation.
4. Partially imaged is pneumocephalus involving the right
temporal region as seen on concurrent CT examination.

CT Head [**2133-1-14**]:
1. Extensive intracranial hemorrhage as detailed above with
right cerebral
convexity subdural hemorrhage measuring up to 11 mm, a small
left frontal
subdural hemorrhage measuring up to 4 mm, extensive right-sided
cerebral
subarachnoid hemorrhage, and likely component of
intraparenchymal right
frontal contusion.
2. Multiple scalp hematomas involving the left occipital region,
the right
frontal region, and likely near the right frontal convexity.
3. Left basilar skull fracture involving the left occipital bone
with
extension into the left occipital condyle and petrous portion of
the left
temporal bone, with involvement of the left internal carotid
canal. Recommend CTA for further evaluation.
4. Sinus opacification likely related to recent intubation

ankle X-ray [**2133-1-14**]
Minimally displaced lateral malleolar fracture. Small well
corticated ossific density inferior to medial malleolus could
represent sequelae of old trauma.

CTA neck [**2133-1-14**]:
No evidence of vascular injury, thrombosis or aneurysm. The left
basilar
skull fracture involving the left occipital bone and extending
into the left carotid canal is redomenstrated. The left carotid
artery is suboptimally opacified in this region, however given
symmteric appearance a focal intimal dissection is felt
unlikely. ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 30217**] [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Numeric Identifier 83113**])

ECHO [**2133-1-15**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.


CT Head [**2133-1-15**]
1. Increase in the right inferior frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with
mild increase in the leftward shift of the midline structures.
2. Increase in the conspicuity of the subarachnoid hemorrhage in
the left
frontal and parietal lobes. Persistent mass effect on the right
lateral
ventricle with mild increase in the leftward shift of the
midline structures.
3. Other details as above. Please see the prior CT head study
for details
regarding the osseous structures.
4. Unchanged appearance of the scalp soft tissue swelling, on
the left side.

MRI C-spine [**2133-1-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multilevel neural foramen narrowing as above.
2. Posterior disc bulge at C6-C7 and C7-T1 levels without
impingement on the cord or central canal stenosis.
3. Incidental note is made of blood within the left cerebellar
cistern.

CT Head [**2133-1-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Re-demonstration of multifocal intracranial
subdural,
intraparenchymal, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is no new
hemorrhage
identified. Right subarachnoid hemorrhage is somewhat less
conspicuous than on prior study. There is continued mass effect
upon the right lateral
ventricle, and associated rightward shift of midline structures,
again
measuring approximately 1 cm. Small amount of intraventricular
blood is again identified in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left
lateral ventricle. There is no new hemorrhage or increased mass
effect identified.

LENIS [**2133-1-20**]:
CONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT in the right or left lower
extremity.

CTA Chest [**2133-1-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right upper lobe pneumonia.
2. No central pulmonary embolism. Limited distal branch
evaluation due to
respiratory motion artifact. In a single posterior segment right
upper lobe pulmonary artery, there is suggestion of a filling
defect, although this opacity overlaps with adjacent airspace
disease, and may be artifactual.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-15**]. He was intubated and
taken to the ICU with Q1hr neuro checks. CT imaging showed
worsening hemorrhage. Platelets were goiven for history of
aspirin use. e was on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. MRI
c-spine was performed on [**2133-1-15**]. He was see by Orthopedics who
recommended an air cast for his ankle. Serial CT's remained
stable. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] cleared his cervical collar on [**2133-1-16**]. He was
weaned toward extubation. Repeat Head CT on [**2133-1-17**] was stable.
His Mannitol was held due to NA/OSM parameters. He failed Speech
and Swallow evaluation at the bedside and a Dobhoff was placed.
On [**1-19**] his Mannitol was discontinued. His Foley was
discontinued. He was transferred to the step down unit. His
dilantin dose was increased for a corrected level of 6.1.

The patient had tachypnea overnight but his oxygen saturation
remained within normal limits. His neuro exam remained stable.
During the day on [**1-20**] his tachypnea became worse and his ABG
showed respiratory alkalosis. He continued to oxygenate well.
Lenis were negative for DVT. His RR went up to the 40s and he
became more lethargic and stopped fo
