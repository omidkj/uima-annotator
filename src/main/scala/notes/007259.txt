Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
Healthcare acquired pneumonia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
81 yo F with history of HTN, hypothyroidism, depression, seizure
disorder, recent right hip ORIF complicated by pneumonia,
presents with continued difficulty clearing infection.   She had
been discharged on last admission with cefpodoxime and
metronidazole but has still done poorly.  She was transitioned
to levofloxacin on [**4-15**] which still had minimal effect.  CXR
showed bilateral lower lobe pneumonia.  She was reported to look
worse this morning, with general malaise and respiratory
distress. Her vitals at the nursing home were T 99, 02sat 93% on
2L.
.
In ED, patient received meropenem and gentamicin because she is
penicillin allergic.  Her chest x-ray showed a LLL pneumonia and
she had a white count of 15.  On transfer, her vitals were: T
98.3, HR 64 BP 108/36, RR 22, Sat 97% on 2L
.
Currently, patient reports that she feels that her breathing is
comfortable.  She never felt that she was very short of breath
at the nursing home, but was told by the staff that she was not
improving on the antibiotics that she was on.  Currently feeling
slightly nauseous, and having pain only when she is moving
around.


Past Medical History:
- Dementia.
- Depression with a history of suicide attempts (last
hospitalized on the Psychiatric Unit at [**Hospital1 18**] in 11/[**2132**]).

Social History:
The patient is widowed; has 2 children (son and daughter). Went
to [**University/College **]where she majored in English with a minor
in history and worked a number of different jobs after
graduating but primarily worked in editing for a publishing firm
and at one point as a medical researcher. She ultimately had to
quit work when she became psychiatrically ill in her 30s (also
reports this is when her seizures started), and it appears this
was all after she found her mother hanging after a suicide
attempt, and her son says she has "PTSD" from this event). She
has not worked since the early [**2104**], and was divorced from her
husband around this time as well. She had been living
independently in her own apartment until about 4 years ago but
had been failing for about the last five years of that stretch
with multiple falls which went undiscovered for days at a time.
She has been wheelchair bound for falls and cerebellar ataxia
(possibly related to extended phenytoin use) for the last 6
years or so. Her first placement was at [**Hospital1 **], where she
stayed for a year and did not like, and she has been at [**Last Name (un) **]
for the last three years.

Substance Abuse History: Per son history of alcoholism, now has
occasional weekly drinks at [**Last Name (un) **] with other residents and
son. [**Name (NI) **] is unable to specify amount. Distant history of tobacco
use, none in past 40 years. Denied knowledge of illicits.
Possible distant history of valium abuse in 70s.


Family History:
[**Name (NI) **] mother with completed suicide, son unsure of etiology
half sister who has been depressed and frequently hospitalized

Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral and aortic regurgitation.
.
LENIS: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 F with recent admission for R hip repair complicated by
aspiration pneumonia who presented with persistent hypoxia and
infiltrates.  Pt had been treated with two different courses of
antibiotics without resolution of the PNA.  She returned to the
[**Hospital1 18**] from rehab on [**4-20**] with evidence of a bilateral lower lobe
pneumonia and elevated WBC count.  She was empirically started
on Vanc and Meropenem prior to admission to the floor.  However,
she was noted to become increasingly somnolent, febrile and
hypoxic on the regular medicine floor.  She was transferred to
the ICU and HCP confirmed the code status as DNR/DNI.  Pt
underwent a speech and swallow evaluation and was cleared for a
regular diet. She was supported in the ICU with high flow oxygen
and broad spectrum coverage with Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] and Azithromycin.
She was persistently febrile and all cultures were negative for
growth.  She was transiently hypotensive and responded minimally
to bolus IVF.  CXR infiltrates became progressively worse and
oxygen requirement continued to increase.  Diuresis was
attempted but was not well tolerated due to low BPs and family
felt that CVL and pressors were not really in line with goals of
care.  CT Chest was performed on [**4-23**] and showed interval
progression of patchy infiltrates and effusions.  Lasix gtt was
started in an attempt to improve oxygenation and despite almost
1L of volume removal, pt became more hypoxic and somnolent.  HCP
made the decision to transition to comfort care on [**4-24**] and pt
was started on a morphine gtt. She expired on [**2135-4-24**] at 1410
hours. After discussing with son [**Name (NI) **], it was decided to proceed
with autopsy.
