Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on Exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with visualization of clean coronaries
and severe mitral regurgitation

History of Present Illness:
65yoM with h/o chronic anemia, OSA on CPAP, asthma, COPD, sCHF
with EF 45-50% and recently diagnosed Afib and severe mitral
regurgitation who initially presented to [**Hospital3 3765**] on
[**2185-9-13**] with one week of progressively worsening dyspnea on
exertion. This DOE occurred in the setting of increasing salty
food intake, prior to this he had noted improving LE edema s/p
dx of afib and initiation of diuresis with torsemide.
Confounding this history is the fact that approximately 1 week
ago he began to have URI symptoms and increasingly productive
cough-although these symptoms have resolved.

At [**Hospital1 **] he was ruled out for PE with a  V/Q demonstrated
low-probablity of thromboembolic disease, ruled out for MI with
flat enzymes, PFTs demonstrated mixed moderate
obstructive/restrictive picture FVC 44%, FEV1 40% TLC 70%, CXR
demonstrated CHF with small b/l pleural effusions, with kerly's
B lines and he was treated with:
lasix 40mg IV BID,
Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **],
Lisinopril 10mg daily,
Flonase,
Advair 250/50 [**Hospital1 **],
verapamil XR 240 daily,
pantoprazole 40mg daily, and
Spiriva 18 mcg daily.
He reports urinating "3 gallons" over the last 3 days, although
I/O's are not recorded in the paperwork provided. His Cr rose
from baseline of 1.2 to 1.6

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension +
2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
- Imagining stress test in [**2184**] demonstrated an area of inferior
infarcted tissue
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Chronic anemia
sCHF w/ EF 45-50%
Severe mitral regurgitation
Afib on coumadin
OSA on CPAP
Asthma
COPD
Peripheral Neuropathy
Habitual Cough


Social History:
Had 14 pack year smoking history approximately 30 years ago,
currently denies tobacco, etoh or drug use. Mr.

inspiratory crackles bilaterally, no wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ peripheral edema. No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Cardiology Report Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2185-9-16**]


*** Not Signed Out ***

BRIEF HISTORY:   65 year old man with a history of COPD,
obsrtuctive
sleep apnea on CPAP, hypertension and mitral regurgitation who
recently
develop atrial fibrillation and presented in decompensated
congestive
heart failure with severe mitral regurgitation by TTE and
ejection
fraction 45%.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
1. Mitral regurgitation

PROCEDURE: Diagnostic coronary angiography performed via the
right
femoral artery using a 5-French sheath and 5-French JL-4 to
engage the
LCA dna 5-French JR-4 to engage the RCA as well as a 5-French
pigtail
catheter to enter the left ventricle. Pulmonary artery
catheterization
performed via the right femoral vein using a 8-French sheath and
a
7-French PA catheter.

Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
