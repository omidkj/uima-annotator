Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
coffee ground emesis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper Endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
74 yo F with h/o GI AVMs but none on scope 1 year ago, on
warfarin for mechanical mitral valve. Showed up at [**Hospital 191**] clinic
and had an episode of coffee ground emesis there. Denies fever,
chills, chest pain.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.4 70 130/35 100. Patient reported
as having pallor and appearing fatigued at presentation. NG
lavage initially with scant coffee grounds and cleared on second
500 mL lavage. HCT at 23.4 in ED down from 33 on [**2150-6-15**].
Patient was crossmatched for six units. No vitamin K or FFP
given in the ED. Receiving first unit of PRBC at time of signout
to floor. Vitals at time of signout to ICU were T afebrile, HR
76, BP 136/76, RR 16, O2Sat 100% RA. GI reportedly aware of
patient and planning to scope in AM unless becomes unstable.
.
Upon arrival, patient appears fatigued, pale. Her husband
describes that she was recently admitted for acute decompensated
right sided heart failure and was aggressively diuresed. She was
discharged to home and about 24 hours later began to have
worsening nausea and began to vomit. She vomited for several
days without evidence of coffee grounds or hematemesis, and
reduced PO intake. She eventually came in to [**Company 191**] for further
evaluation where she vomited and was found to have coffee
grounds in her emesis and was sent to the ED. The only recent
medication changes were that her spironolactone was increased
from 25mg to 100mg, and that she was told to stop taking her
diovan. She has had no sick contacts or travel. She admits to
chills but no fevers. No diarrhea or abdominal pain, no dysuria
or shortness of breath.
.

Radiology Report CHEST (PRE-OP AP ONLY) PORT Study Date of
[**2150-6-22**] 12:25 AM

SINGLE PORTABLE AP SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Severe
multichamber
cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular engorgement and right basal
septal thickening persist. The patient is status post mitral
valve replacement. There are multiple median sternotomy wires in
unchanged position. The left chest wall pacemaker is in
unchanged position. There is no large pleural effusion,
consolidation or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Persistent severe cardiomegaly. Probably no acute
decompensation.


 LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) Study Date of [**2150-6-23**]
2:30 PM

FINDINGS: The hepatic veins and their confluence are markedly
distended,
consistent with provided history of heart failure. The hepatic
echotexture is normal, without evidence of a focal lesion. The
main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow, with
pulsatility again reflective of right heart failure. Small
gallstones are present within the gallbladder, without secondary
findings for cholecystitis. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
biliary ductal dilatation with the CBD measuring 2 mm. The
spleen is normal in size measuring 11 cm. No ascites is evident.
The pancreas is normal in echotexture, without evidence for
peripancreatic or fluid collection. No pancreatic ductal
dilatation or calcifications are evident.

IMPRESSION:
1. No peripancreatic fluid identified.
2. Markedly distended hepatic veins and pulsatility of the
portal vein,
compatible with provided history of tricuspid regurgitation.
3. Cholelithiasis.


CT ABD W&W/O C Study Date of [**2150-6-25**] 11:09 AM

  FINDINGS:
In the liver, segment IV hypodense lesion measuring less than 1
cm is again identified, too small to characterize, but unchanged
from prior study.


IMPRESSION:

1. No CT evidence of acute pancreatitis or complications
thereof, including no peripancreatic stranding, peripancreatic
fluid collections, vascular compromise, or evidence of
pancreatic necrosis.

2. Findings reflecting known congestive failure, including
marked dilation of the IVC and hepatic veins, contrast reflux
into the venous system on arterial phase imaging, heterogeneous
hepatic parenchymal perfusion, and periportal edema/gallbladder
wall edema secondary to third spacing.

3. Multiple bilateral low-attenuation renal lesions, previously
characterized as cysts by ultrasound.
