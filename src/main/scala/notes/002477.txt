Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 77-year-old woman with
unresectable pancreatic cancer with pulmonary embolism and
small-bowel obstruction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented to an
outside hospital on [**12-24**] after her daughter noticed
increased somnolence and vomiting.

She was taken to [**Hospital3 15174**] and was found to
be unresponsive.  She was intubated for airway protection.  A
computed tomography scan showed a small-bowel obstruction.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] Intensive Care Unit.
Upon arrival a repeat abdominal computed tomography showed
ascites and partial small-bowel obstruction and enlargement
of the pancreatic head.  The patient was evaluated by Surgery
who felt that the mass was unresectable.  The small-bowel
obstruction was managed medically.  The patient was
extubated.

Her course was then complicated by development of a
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

The patient was transferred to the medical floor on [**2123-12-28**] where she desaturated to 85% on 4 liters.  It was
thought that the patient had vomited and aspirated.  A
computed tomography angiogram was performed which showed
bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Lower extremity Doppler studies
also revealed bilateral deep venous thrombi.  The patient was
started on heparin intravenously and an inferior vena cava
filter was placed.  The patient subsequently developed
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome.  Her platelets
dropped from 150 to 98.  Heparin was stopped.

At that point, the patient realized her diagnosis and
prognosis.  The patient stated that she was not interested in
radiation or chemotherapy.  Code discussions were held with
the patient and her family.  She was made comfort measures
only.

The patient was transferred to the medical floor.  The
hospital course the following day, on transfer to the medical
floor, the patient passed away while on a morphine drip.  The
family were notified and declined autopsy.
