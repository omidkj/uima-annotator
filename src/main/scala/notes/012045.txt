CTAP: Preliminary Report !! WET READ !!
1. No evidence of large amount of free air. Small
microperforation (at the
transverse colon, 2;39) cannot be completely excluded, but is
unlikely.
2. Large amount of fluid-density ascites.
3. Moderate left and large right pleural effusions with bibasiar
opacities c/w
atelectasis or aspiration (pat aspirated per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3315**].
4. liac, sacral and spine mets. Fx of the left inferior pubic
ramus of
indeterminate age.
5. Gallstones

CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an
increase in
interstitial structures, diameters of pulmonary vessels, and
interstitial
markings and in bilateral pleural effusions. In addition, the
size of the
cardiac silhouette is larger than before.

Overall, this is consistent with increasing interstitial lung
edema.

No other abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for bright red blood per
rectum.  This continued in the hospital and his hematocrit fell
to 20.  He was transfused 4 U of PRBC with improvment.

He underwent colonoscopy which revealed radiation proctitis.
Multiple AVMs were cauterized with hemostasis.

Following his colonoscopy, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed severe
abdominal pain and respiratory distress concerning for
perforation of the bowel.  He was admitted to the intensive care
unit.  Imaging did not reveal perforation, and his pain
improved. His dyspnea continued, however, and he was found to
have evidence of congestive heart failure and bilateral pleural
effusions.  Diuresis for acute diastolic heart failure was
iniated, and he refused diagnostic and therapeutic
thoracentesis. He responded to gradual diuresis during the
admission.

The patient was found to be very weak, malnuourished
(cachectic), and had anasarca and marked dependent edema (4+ =
leakage of serum through skin).

PT evaluated his mobility and recommended rehabilitation
hospital stay.  Patient and family expressed wishes to
transition oncologic care to the [**Hospital1 18**], to obtain a second
opinion following discharge.  This process was initiated.  Based
on the information they receive, they will decide as a family
about transitioning to hospice care.

Palliative care consultation was obtained to assist the family
and team in determining a safe discharge plan and in further
discussions of the above issue. The patient and family preferred
to transition to home, but were aware that he may benefit from a
hospice home or other facility given his deconditioning and care
needs.

Home medications for blood pressure and prostate cancer were
continued, as well as for depression and GERD.
