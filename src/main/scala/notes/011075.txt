CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2135-12-18**] 1:01 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ro pna chf

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with mi, and flu being treated also for pna
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
ro pna chf
INDICATION: MI, flu, also being treated for pneumonia. Shortness
of breath.

TECHNIQUE: AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained
without comparisons.

FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette is prominent. The hila are
promienntm but not ideally evaluated secondary to technique and
patient rotation. Mild diffuse prominence of interstitial
markings suggest mild CHF. There is no evidence of pleural
effusion or focal consolidation. There is diffuse osteopenia.

IMPRESSION: Likely mild CHF.

ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. [Intrinsic
left
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include
inferolateral hypokinesis and inferior hypokinesis/akinesis.
Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2125-11-7**], left
ventricular
systolic dyfunction is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F [**Hospital **] Rehab resident w/ viral bronchitis [**2-7**] ?influenza, with
possible superimposed pneumonia, anemia of unclear etiology, and
elevated troponin [**2-7**] NSTEMI vs demand ischemia.

1)Viral Bronchitis with evidence of PNA on CXR  Kept on droplet
precautions and ruled out for influenza by negative nasal
washings.  Treated bronchitis supportively with nebulizer
bronchodilator therapy and inhaled steroids.
Maintained oxygen saturation in 90s with oxygen by nasal canula.
Will complete 7 day course of levaquin for presumed CAP, as she
had a right hilar distribution opacity on CXR. She had a sputum
culture which grew out MRSA, likely colonized but conderning for
pneumonia. Started on Vanco on [**12-21**], renally dosed. Recieved a
midline for Vanoc administration for 7 days. Her vanco trough
will need to be checked before the next dose.

2) NSTEMI: Admission and follow up EKG's only demonstrated old
LBBB. No new
ischemic changes.  She was managed medically with ASA, beta
blocker and started on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] (h/o cough with ACE-I).  Enzymes
trended down, and Echo demonstrated new inferior and
infero-lateral wall motion abnormalities.  Cardiology was
involved and recommended medical management and cath at a later
time, but the patient and family agreed that she would not want
catheterization.

3)Diastolic CHF:  Maintained on outpatient regimen and kept a
negative fluid balance with lasix regimen.  Echo continued to
show LVH, LAE and preserved EF,but also new wall motion
abnormalities compared to previous echo.  Started [**Last Name (un) **] on this
admission. The patient developed a contraction alkolosis after
gentle diuresis )4 liters over length of stay) therefore can
decrease rate of diuresis with the goal being even - 500 cc
negative over 24 hours.

4) Anemia:  Was guiaic negative on rectal exam, and anemia
studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  This
remained stable through hospital course.

5) Elevated LFTS - unclear etiology but possibly due to passive
congestion from CHF.
Trended down through hospital course.

6)CRI
Remained at baseline creatinine. Electrolytes and fluid  balance
were monitored. Medications were dosed for her reduced
creatinine clearance.

7)Gout - stable; allopurinol held during this admission, then
restarted on [**12-21**] at a renal dosage (QOD)

8)DM - Continued on Insulin per home regimen and covered with
sliding scale insulin.  [**Doctor First Name **] diet and finger sticks.  Continued
gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy.

9)h/o CVA -  Residual right sided weakness. Continued plavix
through hospital course.

10) Disposition: to MACU at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab today.
