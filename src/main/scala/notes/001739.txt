Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Transfer for high-risk cardiac
intervention.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 86 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus and
hypertension, who was in his usual state of health until 2
a.m. the morning of [**2178-8-2**], when he awoke with
shortness of breath and diaphoresis.  At that time, he took
Combivent without help and went back to sleep.  He then again
awoke at 04:00 a.m. with worsening dyspnea that was not
responsive to his Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  At that
time, he then went to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital where he was
treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation with Solu-Medrol, Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers
and antibiotics.  While at [**Hospital3 1280**], he had an episode of
acute shortness of breath and at that time it was felt that
that he was in flash pulmonary edema.

An EKG on [**2178-8-3**], showed transient anterior ST
elevations and T wave inversions.  At this time, his cardiac
enzymes were positive with a peak creatinine kinase of 202 on
[**2178-8-4**].  Cardiac catheterization at this time
revealed the following:  Left main with 80% stenosis; right
coronary artery 70% ostial lesion; patent ductus arteriosus
80% lesion; diffuse left anterior descending and left
circumflex disease.  The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for possible PCI versus
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery and they
felt that he was a poor surgical candidate given his history
of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; thus, the
management of these lesions were those of undergoing a PCI of
the right coronary artery and left main.

The patient's post catheterization course had also been
complicated by a right groin hematoma.  A subsequent
ultrasound was negative for pseudo-aneurysm, and a CT scan of
the abdomen was also negative for retroperitoneal bleed.  The
patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit Team
for which he actually went to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
for further monitoring in anticipation of high risk left main
coronary artery intervention on [**2178-8-6**].

Upon transfer to the Floor, the patient continued to
experience shortness of breath and was given Albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers with minimal relief.  The patient was
then given 40 mg intravenously of Lasix and had minimal urine
output.  The patient was then stared on Bi-PAP on 14/9 with
improvement of dyspnea and O2 saturation of 96%.

Upon initial evaluation by the Coronary Care Unit team the
patient was resting comfortably on Bi-PAP mask and denying
any chest pain.

Of note, prior to this hospitalization, the patient had
noticed a recent increase in his lower extremity swelling and
a productive cough.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs on admission, temperature
97.0 F.; pulse rate 82; blood pressure 119/53; respiratory
rate 17; oxygen saturation 94% on four liters.  In general,
the patient is an elderly Italian male in mild respiratory

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  On admission, the patient is an 86 year
old male with known three-vessel coronary artery disease
including left main disease, severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
peripheral vascular disease, who was admitted for high-risk
cardiac catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  Upon admission, the patient was
continued on aspirin, Captopril, nifedipine and Lipitor.  The
patient was weaned off of the Nitroglycerin drip.  Beta
blockers were held secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and the GTB3A inhibitors were held secondary to his
right groin hematoma.  His cardiac enzymes were cycled and
remained flat and there was no evidence of acute ischemia on
his repeat electrocardiograms.

On hospital day number two, the patient was taken to the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and stents were placed to
his left main, 4.5 centimeters; right coronary artery (4.5
millimeters to 13 millimeters) and posterior descending
artery (2.5 millimeters by 18 millimeters).  The patient was
then continued on Integrilin for the next 18 hours.

Of note, the patient was switched from nifedipine to
Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q. day.  The patient then continued to
remain chest pain free throughout the remainder of his
hospital course and was chest pain free up to the projected
discharge date.

Myocardium:  The patient's ejection fraction at the outside
hospital showed a 60% preserved ejection fraction and his ACE
inhibitors were titrated up throughout this hospital stay as
tolerated.

Rhythm:  The patient had no rhythm issues throughout the
majority of his hospital stay.  However, of note, the two
nights prior to discharge, the patient had a 13 beat run of
nonsustaining ventricular tachycardia.  The patient was
asymptomatic at the time, with stable vital signs and it
occurred while the patient was sleeping. The patient
continued to be monitored rigorously on Telemetry for signs
of any further episodes of ventricular tachycardia.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient had severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease with FEV1 of less than 1.  The patien
