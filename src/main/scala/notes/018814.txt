[**2188-12-8**] CXR :
1. No pneumothorax visualized in the right apex.
2. Stable appearance to the chest with low lung volumes
bilaterally and right hemidiaphragm elevation. Stable
post-surgical changes to the right posterior rib.
3. Dilated esophagus due to esophagus dysmotility.

[**2188-12-11**] Ba swallow :
Dilated proximal esophagus with narrowing distally at the site
of the prior Nissen. This likely reflects worsening stenosis in
the Nissen fundoplication.

[**2188-12-15**] EGD :
The esophagus appeared tortuous and dilated with solid food
retained within. The lower esophagael sphincter was open without
pathological narrowing - the scope easily passed through. These
findings are suggestive of an esophagael motility disorder
rather than a mechanical obstruction.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent a right thoracotomy with
tracheoplasty and bronchoplasty (see formal Op note for further
details).  She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the
SICU in stable condition.  She was extubated and placed on a non
rebreather with adequate saturations.  Her pain was controlled
via an epidural catheter with Bupivacaine and a Dilaudid PCA.
She maintained stable hemodynamics and stayed in the SICU for 48
hours for pulmonary toilet. Her chest tube was removed on
[**2188-12-7**] and her post pull film showed a small right
pneumothorax and low lung volumes.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she continued to make
slow progress.  She was maintained on bronchodilators, Chest PT
and used her incentive spirometer though not always effectively.
 Her right thoracotomy incision was healing well without
erythema or drainage.  She complained of some dysphagia and was
evaluated by the speech and swallow therapist who felt that all
of her symptoms were related to her pre op GERD as opposed to a
swallowing problem.  She was placed on her pre op motility
agents and PPI but continued to complain of epigastric pain and
nausea with all foods/liquids. A barium swallow was done which
revealed a dilated proximal esophagus with some narrowing
distally, possibly at the site of her prior Nissen.  She then
underwent an EGD and the scope passed easily without
obstruction.  The esophagus showed evidence of reflux.

In the interim she was placed on TPN to help maintain her
caloric needs. After no new pathology was identified a diet was
reinstituted and she was able to take small frequent meals.  The
psychiatric service was also consulted as she appeared
depressed, discouraged and difficult to engage in her care.
They felt that her symptoms were magnified by her anxiety and
recommended continuing Ativan and increasing her Gabapentin.

As her oral intake improved though modestly, her TPN was
discontinued on [**2188-12-17**].  Her blood sugars were in good control
and she was encouraged to eat upright at all times, take small
frequent portions of soft, mushy foods and avoid bread.

Due to her history of Factor 5 Leiden deficiency the
hematologist recommended that she be maintained on 4 weeks of
anticoagulation post op.  She is on Lovenox which should
continue through [**2189-1-2**] and she is able to administer it to
herself.

After a lengthy stay she was discharged on 11/1011 to home with
VNA services including Physical Therapy and she will follow up
in the Thoracic Clinic in 2 weeks.
