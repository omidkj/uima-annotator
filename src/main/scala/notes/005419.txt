IMAGING:
[**7-6**] CT Head: right frontal subgaleal w/o underlying calvarial
fx. small right frontal SAH, likely additional small SAH in left
sylvian fissure. no further intracranial hemorrhage.
[**7-6**] CT Sinus/[**Last Name (un) **]/Max: fx of the left max sinus anterior and
lateral walls. anterior wall minimally depressed. fx extends
superiorly through the infraorbital groove and involved the
infraorbital rim and orbital floor. no evidence of herniation or
entrapment of orbital contents. nasal bone fractures.
[**7-6**] CT Chest: no ptx, effusion, pulm contusion or laceration.
no aortic injury. no mediastinal hematoma. thickening of the
prevertebral soft tissues in the superior mediastinum likely
reflects c-spine injury
[**7-6**] CT Abd/Pelvis: distended stomach. no solid organ injury. no
free fluid or free air. bones: no pelvic fx. L4-5
fusion/laminectomy. L1 inferior endplate compression appears
chronic. T8 severe anterior compression deformity in
age-indeterminate, though there is no definite acute fx line or
paravertebral hematoma identified to suggest acuity. no
retropulsion
[**7-7**] RT Knee: displaced oblique distal femur diaphesis into
intracondylar notch. 17mm of posterior displacement, predominant
medial condylar fracture fragment; tibial plateau preserved.
Also fracture of patella, incompletely evaluated.
[**7-7**] CXR - Appropriate position of endotracheal tube
[**7-8**] CXR: An orogastric tube is in place. The proximal side
port lies at the GE junction. This should be advanced 3 cm.
Endotracheal tube is in good position. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. Remainder of the exam is unchanged.
[**7-8**] CT Right Knee: oblique fx distal femur, with intraarticular
extension notch, mild distraction. Nondisplaced medial patellar
fx. Small knee effusion. No tibial plateau fx.
[**7-9**] pCXR: New right subclavian line terminates at the mid-SVC.
No pneumothorax is seen. There has been interval advancement of
the OG tube. The ET tube is unchanged in position.
[**7-11**] C-Spine: Posterior spinal fusion from C4-T1. For additional
details, refer to the operative note.
[**7-12**] pCXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
nasogastric tube has been removed. The endotracheal tube and the
right subclavian catheter are in unchanged position. Increasing
retrocardiac atelectasis, the left aspects of the thorax are not
included in the image. No evidence of newly appeared focal
parenchymal opacities that could represent pneumonia. No
evidence of pneumothorax.
[**7-12**] pCXR: Endotracheal tube tip is located approximately 5.4 cm
from the carina.
[**7-15**] pCXR: ETT approximately 4 cm from carina.
[**2125-7-16**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Ultrasound (portable): no
evidence DVT
[**7-17**] CXR: Interval improvement in degree of pulmonary edema
since [**2125-7-15**].  Stable bilateral pleural effusions and moderate
cardiomegaly.
[**2125-7-18**] Echocardiography: The left atrium is normal in size.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal with severely
depressed systolic function with anteroseptal akinesis and
apical akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. The calculated aortic valve
area is consistent with critical aortic valve stenosis (valve
area <0.8cm2). However, the aortic valve area is probably
smaller than its potential size in the setting of low stroke
volume (ie, aortic valve area may be larger in the setting of a
larger stroke volume). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2125-7-18**]: CXR Tracheostomy in place at approximately 2.5 cm from
the carina.  Interval removal of right subclavian line.
[**2125-7-23**]: Head CT: No acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or
infarct. Interval increase in size of the bilateral lateral
ventricles and third ventricle. Given history of subarachnoid
hemorrhage, this could be indicative of communicating
hydrocephalus.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 86 y/o female who came in as a basic trauma after
falling down stairs.  Patient suffered multiple facial
fractures, cervical fractures, right distal femur fracture and
SAH. She was intubated for airway protection secondary to blood
in oropharynx. ENT called for evaluation of oropharyngeal but
unable to find bleeding source. Patient started on neuro checks
q2h.  Given propofol gtt for sedation, and fentanyl gtt for pain
control.  Patient with trending hematocrit from 32.6 in ED to
25.6 on admission to TSICU to 18.  Patient transfused 2 units
PRBC.  Plastic surgery consulted and recommend non operative
management of facial fracture.  Ortho spine will wait 5-7 days
for surgical intervention of cervical spine fracture.  Ortho
will take patient to OR for femur fracture.

On [**2125-7-10**] patient taken to OR with ortho for R femoral [**Last Name (un) 101**]
plate.  On [**2125-7-11**] patient taken to OR with spine for posterior
C4-T1 PCDF.  She remained intubated postoperatively.  On
[**2125-7-12**], patient with no cuff leak and remained intubated.
Facial sutures removed.  Patient planned for extubation on
