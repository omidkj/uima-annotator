ago when she suddenly had the onset of decreased energy,
fatigue, decreased taste, a burning sensation in her stomach,

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o female with CAD, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who
presents from [**Hospital **] hospital after echo showed pericardial
effusion with signs of tamponade and clinically stable with
pulsus of 8.

ECHO showed: The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function appears preserved. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a large sized pericardial effusion. There is
right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.

Patient was monitored overnight.  She was kept NPO.  INR was
reversed with vitamin K, with INR 2.2 on transfer.
Anti-hypertensives and anticoagulants were held.  All home meds
except simvastatin were held.  Patient was given IVF since Urine
lytes showed pre-renal with Na < 10. She was also found to have
normocytic anemia, with Hct 28.7 on transfer.
