ALLERGIES:

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
upon presentation revealed temperature was afebrile, blood
pressure was 114/60, heart rate was 79, oxygen saturation was
99% on room air.  In general, the patient was awake and alert
with a cervical soft collar in place.  Her Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination revealed the oropharynx was
clear.  Heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  A grade 3
systolic murmur.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally and without rales.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended and without rebound or guarding.
There were present bowel sounds.  Her rectal examination was
occult-blood positive.  Extremity examination revealed lower
extremity with 1+ edema bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
upon presentation revealed hematocrit was 23.  INR was 0.9.
Chemistry-7 revealed a potassium of 5.7, sodium was 135,
chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was
68, creatinine was 1.3, and blood glucose was 103.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An electrocardiogram was done and showed
a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and T wave
flattening in leads I and aVL, II, III, and aVF.  There were
T wave inversions in leads V5 and V6.  Some ST depressions in
V5 and V6 which may or may not be significant.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient was taken to
colonoscopy and upper endoscopy by Gastroenterology after
having a negative nuclear scan which showed a probably large
bowel source.  There were some shallow ulcers in the stomach
that were visualized, but they were nonbleeding.  The
colonoscopy revealed multiple blood clots throughout with a
possible cecal ulcer.  There was no brisk active bleeding
seen on either scope.  *The patient's bleeding scan was
negative.

After her hematocrit stabilized, she was sent out to the
floor because the family did not wish to pursue any further
colonoscopies for visualizing the ulcer.  She had several
units of packed red blood cells during this admission, and
her hematocrit did not bump appropriately at first.  When she
came out to the floor, she had copious melanotic stools and a
hematocrit drop of 29 to 24 over that day.

She was sent back to the Intensive Care Unit for further
monitoring and endoscopy.  The patient had a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy which again showed
the same lesions but did not reveal any actively bleeding
ulcers.  Also of note, there were some ulcers noted in the
antrum and fundus of the stomach which were sent for cytology
given the patient's history of breast cancer, but these came
back negative for malignancy.

The patient continued to be watched in the Intensive Care
Unit, and her hematocrit stabilized at 28.  She was also
started on Epoetin for the thought that she had a chronic
anemia.  Her hematocrit stabilized and improved to
approximately 29 to 31.  She had no further episodes of
gastrointestinal bleeding.  Her stools showed old blood, but
were negative for new bleeding.

A Surgery consultation was obtained, and they deferred any
surgical intervention and agreed with the plan as was
proceeding.  Gastroenterology signed off and stated that she
did not require any further testing until a re-bleed.  At
that time, that would include either enteroscopy or
angiogram.

2.  CARDIOMYOPATHY:  The patient was in stable heart failure
throughout this time.  She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13584**] from the
Heart Failure Clinic and kept on her stable regimen of heart
failure medications.

3.  LIGHTHEADEDNESS:  The patient had a couple more episodes
of lightheadedness while on the floor.  These would usually
be postprandial and would be accompanied by systolic blood
pressures of about 100.  She was encouraged to take oral
liquids with her meals, and this improved by discharge.

4.  CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS:  The patient arrived with films
from an outside hospital which showed C4-C5 spondylosis with
some signal in the cord.

A Neurosurgery consultation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] was called, and he
recommended flexion extension plain films of the cervical
spine to see if there was instability.  There was no
instability seen, and at this time the patient was to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**] in the clinic for further management of
her cervical spondylosis.  She was not recommended to be
taking any steroids.
