Briefly this is a 49 year old female who presented with
nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. She was found to have
acute pancreatitis. She had been seen previously in [**Month (only) 958**] of
this year with the same symptomatology. She was started on IV
fluids and analgesics and kept NPO. Workup here revealed that
it was likely due to gallstones.

Her past medical history is significant for status post
cesarean section, status post breast implants and
pancreatitis. No known drug allergies. Her medications at
home included insulin sliding scale. Past medical history is
also significant for diabetes.

On her physical examination, she was afebrile, tachycardic at
122, pressure was 144/69, respiratory rate 20, with 98%
oxygen saturation. She was in mild distress. Her lungs were
clear. Heart was tachycardic but regular. Her abdomen was
tender in the right upper quadrant with no rebound or
guarding. Her extremities were warm and well perfused.

Her labs were significant for a white count of 19. Her ALT
and AST were normal at 33 and 34. Her alkaline phosphatase
was 128, total bilirubin was 0.4. Her amylase and lipase were
123 and 131, respectively.

She was admitted to the surgical service under the purple
service of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was managed expectantly with NPO
and IV fluids. She was evaluated by the ERCP service. At that
time, they felt no ERCP was indicated. A PICC line was
placed. The patient was started on TPN. The patient
defervesced slowly on NPO and TPN and further evaluation
showed she had multiple pseudocysts. It was felt that the
patient needed time for the pseudocysts resolution prior to
the operating room. She was kept on imipenem empirically for
the severe pancreatitis. The patient was transfused 2 units
of packed red blood cells on [**2200-4-30**], preoperatively for
a low hematocrit in order to prepare for the operation. The
patient was taken to the operating room on [**2200-5-1**], for
an exploratory laparotomy cystoduodenostomy and make multiple
pancreatic drainages as well as G-J tube placement. Please
see the operative report for further details.
Postoperatively, she was transferred to the intensive care
unit and slowly did well. She was weaned off the ventilator.
Boots were placed intraoperatively and being used when the
patient went back to bed. Postoperatively she continued to
slowly improve and was able to transfer out to the floor.
Physical therapy was consulted and she did well with physical
therapy. It was felt that she could likely go home after
completion of her medical issues. She was started on tube
feeds through her J-tube and her G-tube was kept to gravity.
She continued to do well and tolerated her tube feeds to
goal. Her TPN was slowly weaned off during this time period.
The patient then started on a p.o. diet after tolerating her
tube feeds. She slowly did well from this with intermittent
bouts of nausea requiring her G-tube to be vented. CT scan
was performed which showed complete resolution of her
pancreatic cysts with good drainage with J-P drains and no
other fluid collections that were undrained. The patient
continued to do well and her tube feeds were slowly weaned
off as she increased her p.o. intake. Ultimately her J-tube
and G-tube were clamped and she was able to tolerate this.
Her PICC line was left in until the day of discharge at which
time it was removed. Her J-P drains continued to put out
adequate amounts. The right drain which was near the
cystoduodenostomy site slowly decreased in output. After
tolerating a regular diet, a J-P amylase was sent on the
right drain and it came back at 280. Therefore, her right J-P
drain was removed. It was only putting out approximately 5 cc
per day. She slowly continued to improve and was cleared by
physical therapy. It was decided the patient could be sent
home on regular diet with no tube feeds and with her J-P
drains in place. The patient was discharged on [**2200-5-11**],
tolerating regular diet. PT had cleared her. She was on p.o.
pain medication and doing well. Her J-P drains were putting
out approximately 100 cc per day both superior and inferior
and consisted of pancreatic fluid. The patient was discharged
in stable condition.

Her discharging medications included Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. daily, Vicodin 1-2 tabs p.o.
q.4hours p.r.n. for pain as well as Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
She was also instructed to continue on her home medications.
Her staples were left in place and she was instructed to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in [**12-15**] weeks for staple removal
and wound evaluation. The patient was also instructed to keep
her J-P drain outputs so that possible removal could be done
at a future date. The patient was discharged in stable
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Pancreatitis.

Pancreatic pseudocysts.

Status post exploratory laparotomy, cystoduodenostomy,
drainage of multiple other pancreatic pseudocysts, G-tube and
J-tube placement.

Past history of diabetes.

Status post breast augmentation.

Status post cesarean section.

During this hospitalization, she has had hypokalemia,
hypovolemia, anemia and pneumonia.

The patient was discharged in stable condition.
