Chief Complaint:
non-healing ulcer LLE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
LLE diagnostic angiogram 6/24
L SFA-->Peroneal bpg with R cephalic arm vein [**7-13**]


History of Present Illness:
83yo M, h/o IDDM, CKD (stage 3) and PVD, who presents for
elective angiogram. The patient is a poor historian.  He has a
history of calf claudication for which he received a right
femoral to peroneal bypass with in situ saphenous graft in [**2153**].
 He has done well until ~3-4 months ago when he noticed LLE pain
in the calf and foot with an ulcer developing on the left outer
border of the foot.  He was seen in the clinic.  Given his renal
insufficiency, he is being admitted pre-procedure for renal
protective measures for a scheduled angiogram tomorrow.


Past Medical History:
PMH: DM-2, PAD, HTN, HLD, GERD, CKD (stage 3)
PSH: Pacemaker, Left hip replacement, L knee Arthroscopy, R
femoral to peroneal in situ saphenous vein graft [**1-/2153**]
([**Doctor Last Name **]), CABG, appendectomy

Patient lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) **], MA.  He reports
smoking a pipe for 20 years but quit 20 years ago.  Denies any
EtOH use or recreational drugs.

Family History:
Patient was an orphan and thus is not aware of family hx of
cardiac diseases. His adult children, however, are healthy and
without cardiac diseases.

Brief Hospital Course:
83yo M with DM, PVD, was admitted pre-operatively for elective
angiogram.  Renal protective measures included mucomyst and
bicarbonate drip.  He underwent diagnostic LLE angiogram [**7-5**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] showing patent PFA, patent SFA with distal
occlusion, occluded popliteal throughout, and single-vessel
peroneal run-off from PFA collaterals; please see procedure
report for details.  Accordingly he would require a
Fem-->Peroneal bypass.  Post-procedure he developed midly
elevated creatinine (1.7 on admission, 1.3 at nadir, then rose
to 1.9), so his diuretic was held.  He then developed mild CHF,
manifested as BL lower extremity edema, and with normalizing
creatinine was progressively diuresed over the next several
days.  Cardiology consult reviewed his outpatient cardiac
history, a TTE was obtained showing LVEF 35-40%, mod pulm HTN,
and increased wedge pressure, and he was eventually cleared
medically for surgery.  His prior CABG and RLE bypass had
consumed his leg veins, and vein mapping revealed better vessels
in his LUE.

He therefore underwent a L Fem-->peroneal bypass with RUE arm
vein on [**2159-7-13**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (covering for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**],
who was away at the time and the patient preferred to have the
bypass performed asap).  He received a R IJ CVL due to limited
venous access, and was monitored via a R axillary arterial line
since further distal access attempts were unsuccessful and the
other three limbs being unavailable (two involved in the
procedure and the RLE having a prior bypass was contraindicated
for femoral arterial line placement).  Procedure proceeded
fairly straightforward; please see operative report for details;
at the conclusion he had a palpable vein graft pulse medially
and dopplerable signal distally.  Post-operatively he had
sustained hypotension, responding to crystalloid volume but
requiring neosynephrine drip.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled and
negative and repeat TTE was grossly unchanged without any focal
wall motion abnormalities.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was normal.  He
eventually turned the corner hemodynamically by POD 2.  He was
transferred to the VICU on POD 3.  Due to the IVF volumes given
in response to the earlier hypotension, diuresis was later
successfully initiated with lasix gtt then lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **] for
several days.  He currently appears dry and is off diuretics,
although may need to resume his home dose of Bumex shortly.

The left lateral foot ulcer was covered with dry gauze.  It was
initially covered with antibiotics which were discontinued on
POD 1.  Podiatry consult recommended santyl cream, which is
being implemented, and a foot XR showed no osteomyelitis.
[**Last Name (un) **] consult managed his diabetes and insulin regimen during
his hospital stay.  Physical therapy evaluated him
post-operatively and determined need for rehab placement.  He
was noted by bedside RN to have difficulty swallowing, was
evaluated by swallow consult and video swallow study who
approved him for grounds solids, thin liquids, and crushed meds.
 DVT prophylaxis was maintained with heparin SQ, and GI
prophylaxis with PPI.  By POD 7 he was tolerated a diet,
undergoing PT, appeared appropriately diuresed, on his home
medications, and deemed suitable for discharge to rehab.
