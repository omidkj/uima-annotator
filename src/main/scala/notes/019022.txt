Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Tx from [**Hospital6 1109**] for crescendo angina with plan
for high-risk PCI.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2152-12-29**] cardiac cath
[**2152-12-30**] cardiac cath


History of Present Illness:
HPI: this is a 69 year-old man with CAD s/p CABG in [**2145**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]
and transmyocardial laser revascularization [**3-/2148**] at [**Hospital1 112**] with
PCI [**5-/2148**] with stenting to L circ. post CABG anatomy:

SVG to PDA with R to left collateral to OM3
old occlusion of OM2
SVG to D1 with jump graft to OM1 (occluded [**2147**])
LIMA to distal LAD

[**2147**] cath: intervention PCI to osteal and distal LCX, TIMI 3
flow
70% distal LMCA lesion;
L circ osteal stenosis, serial mid and distal lesions;
OM2 with 95% stenosis:
LAD with 70% osteal stenosis, 100% mid-vessel stenosis
Diag filled by L collat
Rt-dominant RCA 40-50% dz
PDA 70% proximal
LIMA-LAD patent
SVG PDA patent
JVG (D1 to OM1) occluded at aortic root
.
He was doing fairly well, then presented to his cardiologist in
[**Month (only) **] with crescendo angina requiring NTG 75x/[**Last Name (un) **] (previous
30-35/month). He describes substernal CP/R arm pain brought on
by cold/large meals, and walking up stairs; no associated SOB.
He cannot define a set amount of physical activity which induces
angina because of limitation from plantar fascitis and PVD;
likewise he endorses DOE but cannot quantify the amt of exertion
required. He was referred for p-MIBI which showed large areas of
anterior, anterolateral, inferolateral, apical infarction +
ischaemia with almost complete anterior reversibility. He was
then referred for diagnostic cath at [**Hospital1 **] today which
showed as below.
.
[**2152-12-28**] cath:
90% distal LMCA lesion at bifurcation to L circ
90% L circ lesion
LIMA to LAD not completely characterized? vs 100% LAD lesion
SVG to D1 is proximally occluded; jump graft to OM1 patent
SVG to PDA patent supplies collaterals to OM1 and D1
SVG to OM1 occluded 100% (old)
.
His cardiac catheterization was complicated by dizziness, [**7-20**]
CP, nausea, diaphoresis and 2mm inferior STD during LIMA
angiography and thus only achieved a limited look. He was
admitted to [**Hospital1 **] CCU where he was treated with ASA, plavix,
heparin, integrellin, BB, nitro drip but had 2 further episodes
of substernal CP that were releaved w/in 10 min by increased NTG
drip and SL nitro. EKG showed 2mm STD in II, III, aVF, CE's were
negative x 2. He was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] o/n for
monitoring and planned high-risk PCI tomorrow AM
.
On transfer to our CCU he was initially feeling well, then
within a few minutes began feeling [**5-20**] substernal CP radiating
to his R arm + nausea, no diaphoresis or SOB. This was relieved
within 5 minutes by increasing his nitro drip (.5 to 1), 2mg
morphine, and 1 SL NTG. EKG showed 2mm STD in V3-V5 and lead I.

Pertinent Results:
[**2152-12-29**] EKG:  Sinus rhythm. ST segment flattening and slight
depression in I, aVL, V4-V6 which may represent an active
lateral ischemic process.
.
[**2152-12-29**] Cath: FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Widely patent LIMA-LAD and SVG-RCA.
3. Moderately to severely elevated right sided filling pressures
and
pulmonary artery pressures.
4. Severely elevated PCWP with giant V waves from ischemic
mitral
regurgitation.
5. Preserved cardiac output.
6. Calcified but nonobstructive lower abdominal, bilateral
iliac, and
femoral artery disease.  Extravastion of contrast around RFA
sheath.
7. Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal LM/CX with a drug
eluting
stent.  Unsuccessful PTCA of a small distal LPL lesion.
8. Vascular surgery consult for possible surgical closure of
RCFA
arteriotomy versus manual compression.
.
[**2152-12-29**] ECHO during cath lab: EF 40% 1. The left atrium is
normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is at least mildly depressed with inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Lateral wall not well seen but limited views
suggest that it is probably normal.
3.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. With coronary
intervention, the mitral regurgitation becomes more severe to at
least moderate to moderately severe.[Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]
4. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2152-12-29**] ECHO after cath: LVEF 45% Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. Probable PFO present
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildy depressed.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least
moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal
limits).
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2152-12-30**] Cath: FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. (see report [**2152-12-29**])
2. 60% ostial LM lesion prior to stent.
3. 90% LPL/distal CX lesion.
4. Successful PTCA of the 90% LPL lesion.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial left main with a
drug
eluting stent.
6. Normal right sided filling pressures with borderline normal
pulmonary
artery pressures.
7. Mildly elevated PCWP after revascularization and diuresis.
8. Preserved cardiac output.
.
[**2152-12-30**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates
consistent with edema.
.
[**2152-12-30**] U/S groin: IMPRESSION: Hypoechoic mass in the right
groin, which is consistent with a hematoma in the appropriate
clinical setting. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71472**] is a 69 year old male s/p CABG with complicated
coronary anatomy (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D1, SVG to PDA, known
occluded JVG D1 to OM3 with R to L collaterals to OM3) who
presented with crescendo angina with recent p-MIBI showing
reversible anterior defects and one EKG with anterior STD, and
one with infero-lateral ST depression associated with anginal
pain.
.
#) Cardiac:  Patient presented with an NSTEMI and persistent CP.
 He was taken to the cath lab and had a drug eluting stent
placed to the LMCA towards the LCX.  He subsequently had three
episodes of chest pain that night and his cardiac enzymes
continued to rise.  He was taken back to the cath lab the next
morning with angioplasty to a more distal lesion on the LCX.
His medications were optimized for BP and HR control.  He was
discharged on plavix (for at least one year uninterrupted),
aspirin, metoprolol 125mg [**Hospital1 **], losartan 100mg daily and
atorvostatin 80mg.  His norvasc and imdur was discontinued as he
should no longer have anginal pain after intervention and his
other BP meds were titrated upwards (concern over hypotension).
An ECHO during his first cath suggested moderate MR in respo
