Brief Hospital Course:
1. [**Name (NI) 18066**]
Pt remained hemodynamically stable while on the floor with no
signs of active bleeding. He received an additional unit of
PRBC. His Hct bumped appropriately and remained stable in the
high 20s. Colonscopy performed on [**5-15**] demonstrated grade 1
non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids w/ anal tage, non-bleeding
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, small polyp in sigmoid
colon o/w normal. Likely source of bleed thought to be internal
hemorrhoids.

2. Anemia
As above, Hct increased with additional unit of PRBC, remaining
stable. Hemolysis and Fe studies were WNL. Likely an acute on
chronic picture with [**Month/Day (4) 18066**] worsening baseline anemia from MDS.
Now back to baseline crit which hovers around 30.

3. ST depressions on EKG
Present on EKG from a yr ago. Likely not ischemia as they have
persisted.

4. Elevated troponins
Pt presented w/ increased troponins which continued to be high
on serial enzymes. At baseline troponins have been elevated in
the past, so likely [**3-12**] to chronic renal insuff. and not demand
ischemia

5. CHF
Pt with no overt signs of volume overload on exam while in unit.
Lasix dose reduced to 40mg qd vs [**Hospital1 **] while in unit.

6. A. fib
Coumadin held during MICU stay in setting of [**Hospital1 18066**], then
restarted.

7. CRI
Pt with Cr of 2.0 on admission, which then improved

8. Thrombocytopenia
Plts remain in the 60s, at baseline plts have hovered in this
range and higher. [**3-12**] to MDS

9. DISPO - pt was evaluated by physical therapy, and was felt to
benifit from Rehab placment
