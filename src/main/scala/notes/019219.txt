Chief Complaint:
 Hyperglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
atrial fibrillation ablation


History of Present Illness:
63 yom with history of IDDM Type 2, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal afib/atrial flutter on coumadin, CAD
s/p Cypher stenting of the PDA in [**2134**], diastolic heart failure
EF 55%, initally presented today for elective atrial flutter
ablation, but was found to have blood sugars in the 800s.  He
was subsequently transferred to the CCU team for management of
hyperglycemia, hydration given diastolic heart failure. The
patient denies any complaints of chest discomfort, shortness of
breath, fevers/chills, palpitations or significant fatigue,
although he is fairly sedentary due to an ulcer on his right
great toe that is limiting his walking.
.
The patient was first diagnosed with atrial flutter in [**2138**]. He
had a recurrence earlier this year and has been in persistent
atrial  flutter for several months with a difficult to control
heart rate. He is currently on Toprol 250mg qd and Coumadin.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

TEE [**12-1**]:
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium and left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus
is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
right atrium and right atrial appendage. No mass or thrombus is
seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: No atrial thrombus seen. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast in the left and right atria and left
and right atrial appendages. Normal left ventricular systolic
function. Dilated right ventricle with depressed right

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yom with history of IDDM Type 2, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal afib/atrial flutter on coumadin, CAD
s/p Cypher stenting of the PDA in [**2134**], diastolic heart failure
EF 55%, initally presented today for elective atrial flutter
ablation, now admitted to CCU with hyperglycemia to 800.
.
# DM - HOCM vs DKA, no anion gap present on admission.  Patient
was resusitated with IVFs and put on an insulin drip.  Once
sugars returned to < 250 patient was transitioned to home
regimen.  Based on high blood sugars in the hospital, home
regimen was increased on discharge to 14 units NPH qam and qpm,
with 4 units NPH with insulin sliding scale at meals.  Patient
was counseled extensively about insulin and diet compliance, as
A1c was > 13.
.
# RHYTHM: Aflutter successfully ablated.  Patient discharged on
Metoprolol 100 XL [**Hospital1 **] and home dose of coumadin.
.
# CAD:  Patient continued on statin, B blocker, discharged with
metoprolol 100 XL [**Hospital1 **].
.
# CHF:  Once patient rehydrated and euvolemic, he was continued
on home lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **].
