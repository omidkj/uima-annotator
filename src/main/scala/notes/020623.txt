Allergies:
fluorescein / Shellfish

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and throat tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization ([**2135-5-20**])

History of Present Illness:
60 yo F with DMII, HTN, and HL who presented to [**Hospital3 3765**]
yesterday with severe dyspnea and throat tightness. She had been
at the country club when she began to notice shortness of
breath, which became severe quickly. She drove to the fire
station, where EMS was called and she was brought to [**Hospital1 **]. In
the ED, she was thought to be in flash pulmonary edema, and
found to have an NSTEMI with elevated troponins. She was given
lasix, nitro and oxygen with improvement in her symptoms. Nitro
drip was started for blood pressure control. A heparin drip was
started for ACS. A TTE was performed showing LVEF of 35% with
global hypokinesis. She was seen by her cardiologist, who
recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.
On arrival to the CCU, she is feeling well, without significant
dyspnea. She still has some tightness in her throat that has not
improved since the start of her symptoms.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Cardiac
review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Preliminary cath report:
1. Selective coronary angiogaphy in this left dominant system
demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The coronary
arteries were heavily calcified.  The LMCA was patent. The LAD
was a small vessel with luminal irregularities, but was free of
angiographically obstructive coronary artery disease.  The LCX
had a 80% proximal lesion in a tortuous segment prior to a large
OM branch.  The RCA was a small non-dominant vessel that was
diffusely diseased, including at the ostium.  The RCA also had a
subtotal occlusion in the proximal segment. After review of the
angiogram and considation of the patient's diabetes, patent LAD,
small non-dominant RCA, and tortuous proximal LCX which would
not necessarily be easily navigable with a stent or balloon, it
was decided that medical management would be the best option.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial
hypertension with a central aortic blood pressure of 140/66.
The LVEDP was severely eleveated at 31 mmHg.
3. The right femoral artery was closed with a 5 french ExoSeal.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated LVEDP consistent with systolic heart
failure.
3. Mild systemic arterial hypertension.
4. Right femoral artery closed with ExoSeal device.
.
[**5-29**] EKG:
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm with a single ventricular
premature beat.  Borderline voltage for left ventricular
hypertrophy in lead aVL. ST-T wave abnormalities. Consider
strain/ischemia. Borderline low precordial voltage. No previous
tracing available for comparison. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:  60 y/o F with Type 2 DM, HTN, and HL who presented to
an OSH with shortness of breath and throat tightness,
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of NSTEMI and acute CHF
exacerbation.
.
# NSTEMI:  Cardiac cath showed LCx and RCA disease with patent
LAD.  Recommendation was made for aggressive medical management.
 Patient was started on aspirin 81mg daily as patient previously
unable to tolerate higher dose secondary to GI intolerance.  She
was initiated on metoprolol, and her simvastatin was increased
to 40mg daily (patient unable to tolerate atorvastatin in the
past).  Given her decreased blood pressure after initiation of
metoprolol, her ramipril dose was decreased.  Of note, her
throat tightness may be her anginal equivalent.
.
# Acute exacerbation of Congestive Heart Failure:  TTE at OSH
showed LVEF of 35% with global hypokinesis, and the etiology of
her acute exacerbation is likely secondary to ACS.  She was
initially diuresed with IV lasix, which was transitioned to home
PO lasix prior to discharge.
.
# Type II DM: Long-term diabetes complicated by neuropathy,
nephropathy, and retinopathy. She is s/p toe amputation due to
poor peripheral circulation and neuropathy. HbA1c was 6.9%
indicating good control.  Given her high insulin requirements,
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted.
.
# Chronic kidney disease: Secondary to long-standing diabetes.
Creatinine stable at 1.1 this admission.
.
# HTN: Treated with metoprolol and ramipril as above
.
# HLD: Simvastatin in lieu of atorvastatin given history of
intolerance.
.
# Vertigo: The patient endorsed symptoms consistent with
peripheral vertigo, which she has had in the past. She was
initiated on meclizine for treatment, and will need follow-up.
.
# Pannus abrasion:  The patient had two small abrasions under
her pannus on the right. Recommended that she follow-up with her
primary doctor, and apply vasoline and cover with gauze or a
bandage to prevent further damage.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Titrate ramipril and metoprolol
[**Hospital **] rehabilitation
-Repeat TTE in [**5-6**] weeks
