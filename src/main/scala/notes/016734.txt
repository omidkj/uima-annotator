Date of Birth:  [**2052-10-6**]             Sex:   M

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Cefazolin / Sertraline Hcl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
bronchopleural fistula with aspergillus superinfection


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left modified [**Last Name (un) 72148**] window (Schede type thoracoplasty) and
debridement of empyema cavity, closure of bronchopleural
fistula, serratus anterior muscle flap, latissimus muscle flap,
and
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.

History of Present Illness:
49 year-old gentleman with an extensive history of spontaneous
pneumothoraces, more commonly on the left than on the right, and
who is s/p multiple thoracotomies, resections, chest tubes, and
L pleurodesis.  The patient presented to [**Hospital **] hospital in
[**Month (only) **] for fever/chills and was found during the workup to
have an infected bullus on the L side.  He was discharged home
on oral antibiotics, and on [**2101-11-21**] underwent an elective
revision L thoracotomy with lysis of adhesions, wide wedge
resection of the LUL, nodal dissection, and resection of blebs
in the superior segment of the LLL.  The patient was put on
unasyn postop and was later discharged home on oral antibiotics
with a chest tube connected to a Heimlich valve.  However, he
was admitted again on [**2101-12-9**] with fever/chills,
nausea/vomiting, and L-sided chest pain.  CT showed a large left
hydropneumothorax suspicious for a bronchopleural fistula and an
extensive consolidation in the LLL suspicious for PNA.  His WBC
was 25.2, and his temperature was 102.6.  The original chest
tube was left in place, but the
patient also underwent CT-guided drainage of the
hydropneumothorax, which returned aspergillus.  The patient was
put on zosyn and voriconazole.  The pigtail drain from the IR
procedure was left in place for several days and was connected
to suction.  CXR after this period showed resolution of the
fluid
level in the L chest.  A repeat chest CT on [**2101-12-21**], however,
showed a reaccumulation of the L hydropneumothorax, and the
patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of his
likely bronchopleural fistula and aspergillus superinfection. On
the same admission to [**Hospital **] hospital, the patient also
complained of dysphagia with a sensation of food and liquid
"sticking."  The patient underwent a barium swallow at the OSH
which showed decreased peristalsis of esophagus in mid and
distal portions but no aspiration.  He also underwent
gastroscopy, which showed esophageal dysphagia characterized by
slow motility and little peristalsis.  The patient says that his
dysphagia is
improving, however, and he is able to eat many foods. On ROS,
the patient endorses night sweats, fever/chills, weight loss of
25lb over 4 months, and SOB/DOE.


Past Medical History:
Numerous pneumothoraces since age 18 L>R, chest tube (last time
20 years prior to [**Hospital **] hospital), L apical posterior
segmentectomy in [**2077**], L pleurodesis, LUL wedge resection with
LLL bleb resection and LOA and nodal dissection [**2101-11-21**],
multiple pneumonias, infected LLL bullae, colonic abscesses,
depression, anxiety, appendectomy, hernia

consolidation of residual LLL suspicious for PNA; adjacent small
LLL pleural effusion

Chest CT scan    Date: [**2101-12-21**]  [x] outside film
Impression: L chest tube, large L hydropneumothorax, L lung loss
with L shift of mediastinum, extensive infiltrates involving the
remaining portion of the LUL and LLL, interstitial scarring at R
apex

Barium swallow [**2101-12-12**]: vallecular pooling, no aspiration,
dereased peristalsis of esophagus in mid and distal portions,
retained puree and solid foods at these levels

Gastroscopy [**2101-12-14**]: no esophagitis but decreased motility of
esophagus

EKG [**2101-12-9**]: sinus tachy 111, incomplete RBBB, nonspecific at
ST
segment change

CXR
[**2102-1-8**] A pocket of pleural fluid persists posterior to the left
upper lung and much of the left lower lobe has been consistently
atelectatic. Packing material fills much of the chest wall
defect at the base of the left hemithorax above an elevated left
hemidiaphragm, all of which is unchanged since [**1-3**].
Aside from apical scarring the right lung is clear. The heart is
not enlarged. Marked leftward mediastinal shift is unchanged.
[**2101-12-22**]: Enlarged left hydropneumothorax is present with
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with
postoperative state. A left chest tube is present within the
region of the pneumothorax. Some mediastinal shift is also
present to the left.
The right lung appears clear. No infiltrates or pneumothorax is
present on
this side.
