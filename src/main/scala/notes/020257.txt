Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
Wound infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Surgical debridement of left leg eschar


History of Present Illness:
84 year old with a pmh significant for a-fib, HTN, renal artery
stenosis s/p stenting, HLD, COPD, and multiple abdominal
surgeries with a recent MVC with several injuries including
several fractures and pneumothorax presenting for wound eval.
She was evaluated by her rehab physician today and there was
concern over her left lower leg incision which had developed
eschar. She has not had fevers or chills, or purulent drainage.

.
She also notes that her edema has been improving greatly since
being at rehab. Except for her left arm which remains very
swollen. She denies any pain (except soreness from fractured
ribs), SOB, wheeze, congestion, cough, N/V/D, abd pain,
myalgias.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.6 103 121/74 18 90% RA. Surgery
evaluated the wound, not overly concerned, perhaps overlying
cellulitis. Recommended 3 days of antibiotics. A LUE ultrasound
showed thrombus of brachial vein and partial thrombus of basilic
vein. She was given Cefazolin 1g, heparin gtt was started. CXR
showed small bilateral pleural effusions and fluid in the
fissures. Transfer vitals: 98.7 104 126/72 16 98% 3l.
.
Currently, resting comfortably, mildly short of breath.
Otherwise without complaint.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo F with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and left leg eschar admitted for
left leg cellulitis. Hospital course was notable for discovery
left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis, MRSA [**Last Name (un) 1064**]
requiring transfer to the medical intensive care unit, and acute
diastolic heart failure.

#Left leg Cellulitis/Eschar:
Patient was admitted with left leg cellulitis. She was treated
with cefazolin then cephalexin and was evaluated Plastic
surgery. She had an eschar debrided on [**11-5**] and [**11-9**] and will
follow up with Plastic surgery as an outpatient. She was
maintained on [**Hospital1 **] wet to dry dressings.

#Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis:
Patient was noted to have left arm swelling on admission and was
found to have a deep venous thrombosis in the cephalic and
basilic veins. Given that she had had a PICC line in that arm
previously, it was felt that this was PICC related. patient was
started on anticoagulation to be continued for at least 4 weeks,
but decision was made that patient would benefit from life long
anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (see below). Patient was
treated with enoxaparin bridge to Coumadin.

#Hypoxia/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/Methicillin
resistant staph aureus [**Hospital1 1064**]:
Patient had hypoxia and somnolence on the medical floor and was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit. Patient grew
MRSA from sputum culture and imaging was consistent with
bilateral [**Hospital1 1064**] and patient was treated with an 8 day course
of antibiotics for MRSA [**Hospital1 1064**]. Patient was also started on
steroid pulse for treatment of possible concurrent COPD
exacerbation. Her hypoxia slowly improved and she was
transferred back to the floor for continuation of antibiotics
and steroids which were completed prior to discharge. Tiotropium
was started on discharge.

# Hypotension:
Patient developed hypotension in the setting of [**Hospital1 1064**] and
diuresis, but improved with gentle fluid boluses and withholding
of antihypertensive agents which were restarted prior to
discharge.

#Atrial fibrillation:
Patient was admitted in persistent atrial fibrillation wth
tachycardia. She was rate controlled with diltiazem as tolerated
by her blood pressure an
