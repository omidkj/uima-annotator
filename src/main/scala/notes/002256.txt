History of Present Illness:
Admission Date/Time:[**2119-12-20**]

CC: Abdominal pain

HPI:  48M with history of alcohol-induced pancreatitis who
presented to [**Hospital6 19155**] on [**12-15**] with abdominal
pain consistant with prior episodes.  Patient was still drinking
alcohol.  On admission, lipase was 713, along with elevated
AST/ALT.  CT showed evidence of pancreatitis along with
pancreatic duct dilation and an enlarged common bile duct.  His
labs were improving with LFT's including lipase were falling,
however his bilirubin was rising from 2.7 to 9.9. His pain
continued to worsen. MRCP was then performed that showed large
heterogeneous head of the pancreas most likely secondary to
pancreatitis, likely choledochocyst, and pancreatic pseudocyst
or less likely dillated Wirsung duct with pancreatitc divisum.
In addition prior to transfer after approx 48 hrs in the
hospital the patient began to get tremulous and agitated and he
was suspected to be in etoh w/d and was placed on CIWA and
required restraints.

OSH imaging:
CT abd [**12-15**]
CBD(1.7cm) and pancreatitic duct(1.1 cm) dilatation and
edematous changes in the head of the pancreas and in the 2nd
portion of the duodenum with mass effect.
.
MRI [**12-19**]
enlarged heterogenous head of the pancreas most likely due to
pancreatitis, although a pancreatiic neoplasm cannot be
excluded. Also a likely choledochal cyst. right poleural
effusion with possible infiltrate in RLL.
.
[**Hospital1 18**] imaging:
ERCP [**12-21**]
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Mucosa: Severe diffuse congestion and erythema of the mucosa
with contact bleeding were noted in the duodenal bulb and second
part of the duodenum.
Major Papilla: Normal major papilla
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast
medium was injected resulting in complete opacification. The
procedure was moderately difficult.
Biliary Tree: A single smooth stricture that was 20 mm long was
seen at the lower third of the common bile duct. There was
moderate post-obstructive dilation. The rest of the biliary tree
was normal.
Procedures: A 7cm by 10mm Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed
successfully in the lower third of the common bile duct using a
Oasis system stent introducer kit.
Impression: Severe edema and inflammation of the duodenum,
consistent with pancreatitis. (cannulation)
Biliary stricture was noted in the lower third of the CBD,
otherwise normal biliary tree.
A biliary stent was placed.

Non-contrast chest CT [**2119-12-24**]
FINDINGS:
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions, both of which
measure simple fluid in attenuation.  They appear to layer
dependently, with no evidence for loculation based on
morphology.  There is no pneumothorax. In the right lung, there
is dense consolidation of the lower and middle lobe, with
complete opacification of the lung parenchyma and multiple air
bronchograms. In the right upper lobe, there are additional
patchy ground-glass opacities with associated bronchial wall
thickening.  Similar patchy ground-glass opacities are seen
throughout the left lung, most prominent in the lower lobe and
lingula, with relative sparing of the left upper lobe. There is
again bronchial wall thickening. Superimposed interstitial
thickening suggests a component of volume overload. There are no
definite nodules or masses, although evaluation for small
lesions is limited given the underlying consolidation and low
volumes.
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions, simple fluid
attenuation.
2. Dense opacification of the right lower and middle lobes, with
air bronchograms. Additional patchy opacities throughout the
right upper lobe, and left lung, predominantly in the lower lobe
and lingula, compatible with multifocal pneumonia. There is
associated bronchial wall thickening, and narrowing of the right
main stem and lower lobe bronchi, as desctibed above.
3. Interstitial thickening compatible with volume overload.
4. Cardiomegaly.
5. Anterior pararenal spacefat stranding, compatible with
history of pancreatitis. Though evaluation is limited without
intravenous contrast, there is also suggestion of pancreatic
ductal dilatation in the visualized body and tail of the
pancreas.

Right upper extremity ultrasound [**2119-12-26**]:
Complete thrombosis of the right cephalic vein, however, no
evidence of
deep vein thrombosis of the right upper extremity.
.
Non-contrast head CT [**2119-12-28**]:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of
normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, major or minor
vascular territorial infarction. The density values of the brain
parenchyma are maintained. The sulci are slightly prominent for
the stated age. A tiny focal calcification is noted within the
pons. The soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable.
A small mucus retention cyst is noted within the left maxillary
sinus. Otherwise, the vis
