Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2180-10-27**]
1. Small acute bifrontal subfalcine subdural hematoma. Large
subacute left
frontoparietal subdural collection, but new since [**2180-10-4**].
2. Mass effect including 11 mm rightward shift of normally
midline structures. No evidence of significant transtentorial
herniation.

CHEST (PA & LAT) [**2180-10-27**]
No acute cardiopulmonary findings

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2180-10-29**]
1. Post-surgical changes, with pneumocephalus overlying the left
cerebral
convexity.
2. Residual left subdural hematoma, smaller in size from prior
study.
3. Persistent, but slightly improved, rightward shift of
normally midline
structures.
4. Stable acute subdural hemorrhage layering along the falx.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2180-10-30**]
1. Interval slight increase in size of the left subacute
subdural hematoma.
2. No interval change in size or appearance of the subdural
hemorrhage along the falx.
3. Stable shift of normally midline structures since prior
examination.
4. No evidence of a new hemorrhage or mass effect.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2180-10-31**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
change. Severe dextroscoliosis, substantial cardiomegaly without
evidence of overhydration. No safe evidence of larger pleural
effusions. No focal
parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted for a chronic L SDH with 8mm midline shift
to the SICU for Q1H neuro checks. She presented to the
hematology clinic for transfusion of platelets clinic for a very
low count of 8000 and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after an
episode of n/v. Her exam was difficult to obtain due to her
lethargy and a head CT was ordered for AMS and lethargy. Upon
examiniation, she was oriented x 3 and spontaneous with all
extremities, but her RUE was significantly weaker, [**3-16**]. On
[**10-28**], she was taken to the OR in the morning for L burr holes
to evacuated the SDH. Post operatively the patient was much more
alert and oriented, moving all extremities spontaneously and [**4-16**]
in the RUE. Head CT showed some pneumocephalus, but was overall
stable. She was observed in the ICU for tachycardia in the 100s.
She became more lethargic over the next day and repeat head CT
was stable in midline shift. Patient then had a very low
platelet count to [**Numeric Identifier 6085**] and was transfused to a goal of [**Numeric Identifier **].
Neuro and heme/onc consults were obtained. Dilantin level in the
AM was 22 where all antiepliptics were held that day. She will
recieve an EEG in the afternoon to rule out subclinical seizures
as a cause of her increase lethargy. Patient was seen by
heme/onc in the afternoon and discussed poor prognosis with
husband. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the patient's primary oncologist, also spoke
to the patient and husband regarding poor prognosis and code
status. Patient was made DNR/DNI, considering hospice care and
pallative care will see patient to discuss these needs further.
On [**11-2**], husband has decided to make patient [**Name (NI) 3225**]. At 11:15 am,
patient passed away in the SICU with husband at bedside.
