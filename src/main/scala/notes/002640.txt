18, 97% on RA. A CT of L-spine was negative for hematoma, and
MRI of spine was negative for abscess, hematoma, or disc
disease. Overnight she recieved MSO4 2 mg and dilaudid 2 mg x 2
for pain control. The latter made her nauseated and she received
one dose of toradol instead. Around noon she became more
tachycardic (baseline in 110's), febrile (101.8), and developed
a maculopapular rash. The rash was felt to be d/t toradol and
she was treated with methylprednisolone 125 mg and benadryl 50
mg. At 3:45 the patient became hypotensive to SBP's in 70's. She
was given fluids and SBP increased to 120's. She received a
total of 5L in ED. She is being admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for fevers

.
CT OF THE LUMBAR SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST:  No fracture of the
lumbar spine is identified.  There is loss of the normal lumbar
lordosis, which is likely related to patient positioning.  The
intervertebral disc spaces are
maintained.  No paraspinal hematoma is visualized.  Though CT
does not provide intrathecal detail comparable to that of MRI,
the central spinal canal appears patent.  The visualized
paraspinal soft tissues appear normal.  Note is made of a
distended bladder. IMPRESSION:  No definite paraspinal hematoma
visualized.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] FINDINGS:  There are no enhancing abnormalities.  The
conus terminates normally at L1-2.  There is no significant disc
disease, epidural hematoma or abscess.  The vertebral body
marrow signal and alignment is normal.  There is minimal soft
tissue edema within the posterior paraspinal soft tissues
consistent with the prior lumbar puncture. IMPRESSION:  Normal
lumbar spine MRI.
.
CXR (portable): Diffuse opacities are seen in both the right and
left lower lobe.  It was not present on a prior chest x-ray of
[**2170-1-13**], and represent probable bilateral pneumonia.
IMPRESSION:  Bilateral basilar infiltrates consistent with
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
 This is a 21 yo F with a significant past medical history of
Lyme Disease 5 years ago incompletely treated, who presents with
a viral prodrome complicated by fevers, meningeal symptoms with
normal LP, macular rash and hypotension.
.
1. Viral Syndrome- The patient's symptoms had a wide
differential upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but with representation
of the macular rash during her first 12 hours, neck
stiffness/back pain, headache, fevers and CXR findings with
evidence of anemia on CBC, the most likely diagnosis is atypical
pneumonia, most likely secondary to M. pneumoniae. Her WBC
remained normal with a differential indicating a resolving
bandemia, and her fever was controlled with tylenol and pain
with percocet.
On the morning of [**9-16**], the patient was started on Azithromycin
250mg Q24h, and her pain was improving. She did not desaturate
with exercise and was therefore discharged on oral azithromycin
250mg to complete a 10 day course, with follow up in [**Company 191**] within
1 week of discharge.
.
2. Hypotension - The patient was rehydrated throughout the day
before being transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and remained with
SBP's>100 throughout the remainder of admission. Unclear
etiology. Not documented in nursing record, but per ED resident
patient had SBP's in 70's. Etiology includes hypovolemia due to
poor PO intake and febrile illness, drug reaction (toradol,
benadryl). Unlikely sepsis as etiology as patient no longer
hypotensive, lactate normal, and story more suggestive of viral
etiology.
