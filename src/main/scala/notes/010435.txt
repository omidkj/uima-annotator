cerebrovascular accident, depression, asthma,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, atrial fibrillation with a
history of lower gastrointestinal bleed who presents with
bright red blood per rectum.  The patient was in her usual
state of health until 4 AM this morning when she had an
episode of bright red blood per rectum in association with a
bowel movement.  The patient had two to three subsequent
bloody bowel movements.  She denies any fever, chills, chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or dyspnea.  She
does report having some abdominal cramps.  The patient
received 1 unit of packed red blood cells in the Emergency
Department.  The patient had a bleeding scan which was
negative and an nasogastric lavage which was also negative.
The patient was admitted to the Medicine Intensive Care Unit
and transfused another unit of packed red blood cells.  The
patient had no new evidence of bleeding.  The patient's
hematocrit was 100 and stable.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable throughout.  The patient's family
wanted no invasive interventions including colonoscopy and
wanted only conservative management of her bleed.  The
patient has a history of multiple lower gastrointestinal
bleed in the past, last admit was in [**2126**], significant for a
tagged red blood cell scan localizing a bleed to the splenic
flexure.  The patient and family deferred embolization at
that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history
includes lower gastrointestinal bleed, status post multiple
admissions secondary to diverticulosis, previously within the
splenic flexure.  The patient received embolism at that time.

190/60, pulse 84, respirations 24 at 97% on room air.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, extraocular
movements intact, no jugulovenous distension, moist mucous

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.6, hematocrit
31.2, platelets 256, baseline hematocrit is usually around
33.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 102, bicarbonate 29,
BUN 40, creatinine 1.3, glucose 111, PT 12.2, INR 1.0 and PTT
26.5.  Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm with
premature atrial contractions at 79, left axis deviation with
poor R wave progression.  The gastrointestinal bleeding scan
showed a varix in the right distal ilia but no evidence of a
gastrointestinal bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was rather
uneventful and showed no more signs of active bleeding.
Hematocrit stayed stable and increased after transfusion.
Serial hematocrits were monitored and the patient was
hemodynamically stable throughout.  All stools were guaiaced.
The patient's diet was slowly advanced as tolerated, as the
patient was not showing any signs of bleeding.  The patient
was continued on Protonix 40 mg intravenously every 12 hours.

Cardiovascular - The patient has a history of coronary artery
disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.  The
patient's hypertension was stable throughout her hospital
course.  The patient was maintained on her usual
antihypertensive regimen.  The patient's Plavix was held
secondary to bleed risk.  The patient's hematocrit was
maintained greater than 30 secondary to coronary artery
disease.

Renal - The patient's renal status remained stable.
Creatinine rose slightly in response to volume depletion.
The patient was rehydrated appropriately.
