CTA PELVIS W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2158-4-27**] 8:01 AM

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA PELVIS W&W/O C & RECONS

Reason: NO IV CONTRAST, eval for divertic, aortic dz, mesenteric
isc
Contrast: VISAPAQUE

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old woman with severe ab pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
NO IV CONTRAST, eval for divertic, aortic dz, mesenteric
ischemia
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: Cr 3.3 today, renal
transplant pt

HISTORY: 54-year-old woman with severe abdominal pain. The
patient has history of end-stage renal disease, status post
renal transplant.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the abdomen and pelvis
were obtained without contrast. A mesenteric CTA was then
performed with 80 cc of Visipaque followed by delayed venous
sequence.

CT ABDOMEN: There is bibasilar atelectasis. The liver,
gallbladder, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The
pancreas and native kidneys are atrophic. Stomach and small
bowel loops are unremarkable. There appears to be inflammatory
stranding and slight wall thickening of the transverse colon and
hepatic flexure. A small amount of free fluid is identified
tracking around the liver. There is no free air. No mesenteric
or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified. The ventral
hernia is noted in the epigastrium.

CT PELVIS: Foley catheter is noted in the bladder. The uterus,
adnexa, sigmoid colon, and rectum are unremarkable. There is a
small amount of pelvic free fluid. Moderate hydronephrosis is
again identified in the transplant kidney. This is not
significantly changed from the most recent renal ultrasound of
[**2156-11-27**]. A small cyst is noted in the transplant kidney
as well. There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.

CTA IMAGES: There is severe atherosclerotic disease. Bilateral
iliac stents are noted. The mesenteric vessels are highly
calcified and there is significant amount of plaque within the
superior mesenteric artery. However, the mesenteric vessels
appear patent, and no [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] occlusion is identified. The 3D
reformats demonstrate patency and flow to the segments of
abnormal- appearing colon.

IMPRESSION:
1. Severe atherosclerotic disease especially involving the
superior mesenteric
