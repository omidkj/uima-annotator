Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1137**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2179-4-8**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to five vessels. Postoperatively he was
taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. By postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 1137**] had awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Aspirin, a statin and
beta blockade was resumed. On postoperative day two, he was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. He developed atrial
fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and increased
beta blockade, and he converted to normal sinus rhythm. He was
ready for discharge home on POD #6.
