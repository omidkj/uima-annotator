Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 79 yo F with h/o hypertension, CVA in [**2131**] with
residual left-sided weakness, epilepsy and Afib on Couamdin, who
now presents with weakness and found to have Hct drop who
subsequently developed hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
# Anemia: Unclear if anemia was acute or subacute. It is
presumably related to GI blood loss since she was guaiac
positive, however, could also be Fe def [**2-12**] poor nutrition.
Hemolysis labs negative. She was satrted on PPI drip then
transitioned to PPI IV BID. GI was consulted and planned to
scope her once INR trended down. She received 2 units PRBCs.
.
# Lethargy/generalized weakness: Unclear etiology but most
likely secondary to hypovolemia and anemia. Throughtou her
hosptial course, however, she never became interactive or alert
as she develoepd profound hypoxemia. Hypernatremia likely also
contributed to lethargy.
.
#. Hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt wasinitially 97%
on RA on arrival to MICU but became progressively more hypoxic.
She had witnessed aspiration event on [**2-15**] and CXR was consistent
with bilateral airspace opacities and likely pulmonary edema. We
attempted to diurese her but she did not respond to lasix up to
80mg IV and was not awake enough to tolerate BiPap. She became
more lethargic and unresponsive and was not effectively
ventilating. ABG was 7.20/67/62 on 100% NRB. Given her
progressive decline and her wishes to be DNR/DNI, her family was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and she was made [**Name (NI) 3225**]. They were at her bedside when
she expired at 2:05am on [**2144-2-17**]. Progressive hypoxic respiratory
failure was attributed to development of pulmonary edema or
TRALI related to blood transfusions or ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **] related to
aspiration event.
.
# Diarrhea: likely viral etiology but has h/o c diff
- check c diff, stool studies
.
# Afib: Warfarin held and she was given FFP given
supratherapeutic INR.
.
# Seizure d/o:  Phenytoin level monitored
.
