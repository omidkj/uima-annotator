Abdominal ultrasound [**7-30**]:
FINDINGS: A limited study of the four quadrants of the abdomen
was performed and no ascites was identified.
IMPRESSION: No ascites seen in the abdomen.

CXR [**8-2**]:
FINDINGS: Persistent marked cardiomegaly but no evidence of
congestive heart failure. ICD with biventricular pacing lead
remains in place, and there is evidence of prior sternotomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo male with ischemic cardiomyopathy with an
EF=20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD admitted with acute on chronic
CHF exacerbation.
.
# CHF: The patient was admitted for diuresis after an
approximate 40 pound weight gain and history of increasing
dyspnea on exertion.  It was felt that this weight gain was
secondary to fluid overload as he has systolic heart failure
secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF=20%.  He was
started on a milrinone drip which was titrated up to
0.5mg/kg/min as well as a Lasix drip at 20mg/hr.  In addition,
he was given metolazone 5mg [**Hospital1 **].  His home carvedilol was
switched to metoprolol to give more blood pressure room for
diuresis.  We also increased the rate of his pacer from 60 to 70
to increase his cardiac output and therefore facilitate
diuresis.  He put out about 4 liters on this regimen.  The plan
was to stop diuresis if his creatinine raised above 3.5 or if
his abdominal ultrasound did not show any ascites.  Both of
these criteria were met after about 3 days of diuresis on the
above regimen.  Diuresis was then stopped and his home regimen
of diuretics were instituted.  He will be discharged on all of
his previous home medications except for spironolactone.  He
will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in cardiology clinic in one week
where any further changes to his home medication regimen will be
discussed.
.
# CORONARIES: Extensive history of CAD s/p CABG x2, last cath in
[**2176**] with LIMA widely patent, SVG to OM with proximal 30%
stenosis, SVG jump graft to D1 and distal diag patent.  There
were no acute issues from a coronary perfusion standpoint during
this admission.  He was continued on his home imdur, aspirin 81
mg, and Lipitor 20 mg.
.
# RHYTHM: He was in NSR on admission and has a BIV PPM/ICD.
Does have h/o VT with ICD firing provoked by K<4.8.  He was
monitored on telemetry throughout his admission.  Metoprolol was
given to decrease ectopy on milronone.  His home dose of
amiodarone was continued.
.
# Chronic renal failure - Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4090**] as an
outpatient. His chronic renal failure is likely secondary to a
combination of chronic systolic heart failure and poorly
controlled DM.  His baseline creatinine ranges from 2.4-2.9 and
was 2.9 on admission.  His spironolactone and ACE inhibitor were
held.  His electrolytes were repleted to maintain a goal
potassium of [**4-27**].5 because the patient has a history of VT/ICD
firing for K <4.8.  Vitamin
