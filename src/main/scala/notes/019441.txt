Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after you collapsed and it was found you had
large clots in your lungs.  This is likely from being immobile
after your hip surgery. You were initially admitted to the
intensive care unit because your blood pressure was dangerously
low but this resolved with treatment.  Your clots were treated
with an iv blood thinner and you were transitioned to an oral
medication called Coumadin to thin your blood and an injection
called lovenox.  You need to take the lovenox until your
coumadin level is high enough (INR [**3-22**]) and this will take up to
another week to get to.

The coumadin requires monitoring on a frequent basis and Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] will help you organize this.  VNA will check your INR for
the next week and send the results to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will
have you set up in the [**Hospital 2025**] [**Hospital 2786**] clinic.

Your atenolol was stopped beause your blood pressure was low.
You should not take this medication when you go home, but Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] may restart this when you see him.

Finally, you should stop taking your aspirin as you will be on
the coumadin.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] may restart this once you are off the
coumadin.

No other medication changes were made, you should continue all
your home medications as previously directed.

It was a pleasure meeting you and participating in your care.

Followup Instructions:
Please make an appointment with your PCP in the next 2 weeks, as
we discussed your wife will do this.
