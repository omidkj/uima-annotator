Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**]
Chief Complaint:
Left hip pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75 M presenting with atraumatic left hip and and low back pain
worse with standing, relieved with rest, no trauma, no
neurological symptoms, normal rectal tone, large left inguinal
hernia, unable to reduce.  Unable to ambulate, so admitted.  He
was evaluated by Gen Surgery in the ED, who felt the hernia was
stable, and not related to current complaints.
.
Pt states that the pain is severe, [**10-7**]. There is pain
localized L hip region, which starts L anterior pelvis at
midline, and wraps around pelvis to posterior L spine.  Pain
worse with leg movement.  Sharp. Relieved somewhat with rest.
Pt also notes history of bilateral leg pain, which starts at
hips and radiates downt to feet B; does not have currently, and
pt unable to describe if similar pain to hip pain, or if similar
onset.  Pt does note that the leg pain improves when leaning
over a shopping cart.  Pt is unclear if the hip pain improves
with this as well, as he has been unable to ambulate.
.
Of note, multiple phone calls logged in on Epic.  [**12-2**], called
complaining of shortness of breath as well as ? rib vs chest
pain.  Earlier, called about hip pain.  [**11-29**], called about
chalky feeling in throat and difficulty walking as well as cold
extremities; was advised to suck on candy and push fluids. He
was seen by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-27**] for hip pain.  The PCP noted that the
pain might be due to decreased exercise and recommended that
patient start to exercise more.  Hip film ordered but never
performed.
.
Pt also notes significant SOB, DOE, 3 pillow orthopnea (same as
prior), and increased weight gain recently.  He states his dry
weight is 274-275, and states more recently has been 285-286.
He states he drinks "a lot of water", but has difficulty
quatifying.  Estimated a little more than a liter, but this
estimate is suspect.  States he reads labels, and eats low
sodium, but does not add numbers to ensure <2gm/day.  He uses
CPAP, but is not religious about it, and states he tries to use
it for 6 hrs per night, but it is unclear if he is successful in
this goal.

ED Course:
Triage vitals: T 97.4 HR 78  BP 136/87  RR 17  SpO2 92% RA
- plain films L-spine hip and pelvis
- trial of ambulation, unable to stand [**1-30**] pain in hip
- CT pelvis negative for fracture and L-spine showed no fracture
but showed ? gas in back, thought to be incidental
- left inguinal hernia with bowel - failed attempt to reduce x 2
- attempt T-[**Doctor Last Name **] x 20 minutes and reduction, if failed call
surgery
Seen by surgery in ED and found to have b/l Hernias, not
believed to be source of pain.
- Given Percocet x 1, ativan 2 mg x1

Pertinent Results:
CT L-spine ([**2103-12-3**]):
1. No acute fx or malalignment of the L spine.
2. A small pocket of air in the retroperitoneal space next to
the spine at
T11 (image 4:1), incompletely imaged and of uncertain etiology.
Could
represent vaccum gas phenomenon. Recommend clinical
correlations.
RADIOLOGY ATTENDING ADDENDUM
There is some degree of spinal stenosis at L4-5. The severity is
difficult to evaluate due to overlying artifacts, but it is
potentially severe. This appears to be due to a combination of
disk bulging, perhaps protrusion, and facet joint osteophytes.
MR may be helpful if further evaluation is indicated. There is a
small collection of gas in the spinal canal on the right, just
below the L4-5 interspace. This suggests a disk protrusion in
this location, atlhought there is not sufficient soft tissue
contrast to fully evaluate it. There is bulging of the disk at
L5-S1 without evidence of a protrusion. Again, image quality is
limited and MR may be helpful.

CT Pelvis ([**2103-12-3**]):
1. Large L inguinal hernia, with a loop of bowel in the sac. No
evidence of obstruction.
2. bony pelvis noted with DJD, but no acute fx.

Hip and L-spine X RAY [**2103-12-2**]:
No acute fracture or dislocation. Please refer to the concurrent

CT pelvis for additional findings of a large left inguinal
hernia.

Echo ([**2-6**]):
CONCLUSIONS
1. The left ventricle size is normal. There is mild concentric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low-no
