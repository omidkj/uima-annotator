Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for pancreatitis, fevers, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24214**] is a 48 yo man with history of chronic EtOH abuse,
who was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2118-4-11**] with alcohol
withdrawal. He was diagnosed with pancreatitis based on labs,
and given degree of withdrawal and concern for delirium tremens
he was admitted to the ICU and treated with Librium and Ativan.
He subsequently developed signs of respiratory distress
(tachypnea 40-50) and was intubated. On [**4-12**] he was 5.5L
positive and sedated on propofol. He has been treated with
empiric antibiotics: Vanco, Imipenem, and Fluconozole (added
[**2118-4-20**]). His hospital course was complicated by acute renal
failure (resolved), ?pseudocyst formation and persistent daily
fevers ([**Date range (1) 85791**] T > 102F). Work-up of his persistent fevers
has included: 1) negative blood, urine cultures, 2) negative LP
3) negative aspiration of pseudocyst (appeared purulent, but
negative gram stain) 4) negative thoracentesis 5) central venous
line change x 2. General Surgery team at [**Hospital3 **]
suggested a laparotomy and the family requested transfer to a
tertiary care center.

The patient remains intubated, mechanically ventilated, with
central access (sedated with Propofol). He is receiving TPN.
Urine output has been good.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 M with hx of Etoh abuse, HCV presented to OSH with delirium
tremens, intubated for airway protection and found to have
severe pancreatitis. He had unrelenting fevers despite
appropriate antibiosis and had a workup that included pseudocyst
aspiration, thoracentesis of L pleural effusion, LP and serial
CT's. He was transferred for further management and found to
have a PE. He was slowly weaned from the vent and extubated
successfully

1. Respiratory Failure: Intubated on [**4-11**] at OSH, extubated on
[**5-4**]. Barriers to extubation were body habitus (high peep
requirement), PE (hypoxia), oversedation. Patient did well after
extubation

2. Pancreatitis: patient had stable/decreasing pseudocyst with
pancreatic necrosis that surgeons deferred to medical
management.  He had fevers in the ICU thought secondary to his
necrotizing pancreatitis vs PE.  He had an extensive work up in
the OSH and here was intermittently on meropenam.  This was
discontinued after another negative infectious work up.  ON the
floor, he has remained afebrile x 48 hours and has not had
leukocytosis.  He was transitioned from TPN at the OSH to TEN by
Nasojejunal tube in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] without complication. He was
transitioned to PO intake on the floor.  Speech and swallow
evaluated him and did not feel there was evidence of aspiration.
 He will need outpatient follow up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 468**] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 174**] (appointments already made).

3. Pulmonary Embolism - discovered on CT torso. Started on
heparin, bridged to coumadin. Is now therapeutic on Coumadin.
He should have INR checked every 2 days while in rehab with goal
INR [**2-16**] x 3 values.  He will be discharged on coumadin 5mg daily

4. Agitation - patient arrived on a regimen of severe
polypharmacy - haldol IV BID, seroquel, trazodone, propofol,
versed and fentanyl. This regimen was slowly rationalized.
Methadone was used to bridge off of fentanyl and a combination
of antipsychotics were used to control agitation
peri-extubation.  He was maintained on IV midazolam drip in the
ICU, and then moved to tapering valium dosing per CIWA scale.
On transfer to the floor, he was transitioned off his CIWA and
given valium 5mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 doses (this had been discontinued on
[**5-9**] and there was no evidence of benzodiazepine withdrawal on
[**5-10**]).

5. Broken Metatarsal - Ortho evaluated and recommended an
aircast with outpatient follow-up in [**7-23**] days. this has been
arranged as per f/u appointments.

6. Hypertension - Variable hypertensive readings.  Some likely
due to benzo withdrawal initially, though chronic alcohol may
also cause persistent hypertension.  He was moved to daily
Toprol XL 100mg daily and Lisinopril 40mg daily.  Amlodipine
10mg daily was added [**2118-5-9**] (he stated he took this as
outpatient).  His blood pressure will need to be monitored at
rehab to ensure he is well controlled.  If his blood pressure
remains elevated then covering physician can consider increased
metoprolol sl to 150mg daily.

7. Weakness - Very deconditioned when out of ICU to medical
floor, requiring significant Physical Therapy. Felt that would
not do well to go home and so inpatient PT rehab was
recommended.

8. Hyperglycemia - He was started on glargine 20 units at
bedtime in the ICU and this was continued on the floor.  His new
insulin requirements are likely secondary to his pancreatitis.
He will need to continue glargine for now and also to continue
the insulin sliding scale.  If his fasting blood sugars are <
120 x 2 days, would decrease glargine to 15 untis at bedtime.
He wil
