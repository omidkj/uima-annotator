deviation and LBBB morphology. No acute ST or T wave
abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 70621**] is a 46-year-old woman with a history of
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and DM II s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V Pacer/ICD
placement complicated by failure of LV lead placement. This
required subsequent CT surgery placement of subpectoral
epicardial LV lead via thoracotomy. Her brief hospital course by
active problem is as follows:
.
1. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. She was initially admitted for
transvenous placement of a [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer/defibrillator. However,
the LV lead could not be placed during cath on [**10-14**] and
therefore it was placed surgically via thoracotomy on [**10-15**]. She
was treated with antibiotics (cefazolin) for 72 hours after the
procedure. She was continued on her other heart failure
medications, including coreg, spironolactone, ASA, Mavik,
digoxin. She was scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13177**] on
[**2160-10-27**]. She did have a small pneumothorax that was treated
with a chest tube; this was pulled on [**10-21**].
.
2. DM II. Her glucose was controlled with Amaryl and a Humalog
SS. Her metformin was held.
.
3. Leukocytosis. This was attributed to a stress response from
procedure that resolved spontaneously. She remained afebrile
with no growth in her cultures. She was treated with cefazolin
peri-operatively.
.
4. Anemia. This was stable.
.
5. S/P tick bite. She was given a 10 day course of doxycycline
for lyme prophylaxis.
.
