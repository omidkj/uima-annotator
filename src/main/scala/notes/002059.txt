PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is an obese, white female
with a height of 5'2", and a weight of 252 lb with clearly
excess abdominal pannus reaching down to the level of her
knees.  Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her
cardiac exam revealed regular rate and rhythm and normal S1,
S2.  Her belly was soft, nondistended and nontender.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2161-4-9**]
and underwent a panniculectomy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13797**],
which excised a total of 35 lb.  The procedure was successful
and there were no immediate postoperative complications.
Please see operative note for further details.  Due to her
extensive cardiac and diabetic history, the patient was
admitted to the ICU for overnight observation.  The patient
did well on postop day one and was encouraged to get out of
bed, though the patient refused to get out of bed.  The
patient was found in the morning not to have pneumatic boots,
and an incident report was filed.  Later that afternoon, the
pneumatic boot machine was brought to her bedside.

Her hematocrit on postoperative day zero was 27.9, and she
received one unit of red blood cells.  Her hematocrit on
postoperative day one following transfusion was 30.6 and
remained stable throughout the rest of her hospital course.
Her coags were within normal limits during her hospital stay.
She did express a considerable amount of clot material
postoperatively from the wounds, but she did not demonstrate
any persistent bleeding, and by postoperative day three, her
wounds remained dry.  On postoperative day three, the patient
was finally transferred out of the unit.  Because the patient
did not have any MRSA cultures that were positive in her last
day, her antibiotics were changed from vancomycin to Ancef.
On postoperative day three, her Foley was discontinued and
her IV was heplocked.  Her diet was fully advanced which the
patient tolerated.  The podiatry team also came by and
recommended that the patient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) 3044**].  Wound cultures and x-rays of her feet were
taken during the hospital stay per podiatry.  By
postoperative day four, the patient was ambulating and passed
her voiding trial.  We felt that the patient would be ready
for discharge home per patient preference.  It was
recommended that the patient go to a rehab facility, but the
patient clearly refused this option.  Physical therapy also
was consulted and they felt that she would be sufficient with
home P.T.
