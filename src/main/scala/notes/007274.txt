Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p coronary artery bypass grafting times three (LIMA to LAD,
SVG to ramus/OM/PDA)


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **]  is a 70-year-old male with history of
hypertension.  Four days prior to admission, he began having
intermittent left-sided chest "twinging" without associated
nausea, vomitting, or diaphoresis.  He denied an exertional,
pleuritic, or positional component.  He presented to [**Hospital **], where an EKG showed NSR with a possible old anterior
myocardial infarction.  His chest radiograph was clear.  His
cardiac enzymes were cycled and found to be negative.  He then
underwent a stress echo showing reportedly ischemic EKG changes
as well as septal hypokinesis. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.

Throughout his hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and then at [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 86**], patient continued to have continuous but fluctuating
chest pain ranging [**12-15**] to [**4-14**] with description similar to above.
 EKG was unchanged.  He was taken to cardiac catheterization
where he was found to have 3VD including proximal LAD and LCX
lesions.  After the procedure his pain continued. The night
prior to admission, complaining of [**3-20**] chest pain, EKG was
unchnaged.  He received nitro SL x 2, morphine 2 mg x 2.
Heparin gtt was started.  Pain improved from [**3-20**] to [**12-21**].
Several hours later patient awoke with 3/10 chest pain. Nitro
gtt was started at a low dose with minimal relief.  He was
transferred to the CCU.
.
On acceptance to CCU service, Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained of ongoing
1/10 chest pain but felt otherwise well.  Shortly after arrival
to the CCU the patient went to the cath lab for aortic baloon
pump which was placed without complication.  While on the table
he became chest pain free.
.
Review of systems notable for chest pain as above and chronic
cough, unchanged recently.  Cardiac review of systems is notable
for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Asthma
COPD

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization [**2172-7-29**]:
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system revealed
three
vessel disease. The LMCA had an eccentric 30% distal stenosis.
The LAD
had a 60% stenosis proximally and 70% in the mid vessel. The LCx
had 70%
proximal stenosis and 80% stenosis in the mid vessel. The RCA
was non
dominant and had diffuse disease.
2. The LAD stenoses were interrogated using a Radi pressure
wire.  In
serial, the FFR was reduced to 0.74 after hyperemia induced by
the
administration of IC adenosine.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with an SBP of 151 mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systemic hypertension.
ECHO [**2172-7-30**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Overall normal left
ventricular systolic function.
Carotid US [**2172-7-30**]:
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA with no stenosis.

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2172-8-6**] 3:29 PM

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 70 year old man s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:  evaluate for pleural effusions
Final Report
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient
in upright
position. Comparison is made with the preoperative chest
examination of
[**2172-7-30**]. At that time, the patient had received an
intra-aortic
balloon pump device apparently in preparation for emergent
bypass surgery.
The patient was not in failure at that time. Now the patient
demonstrates the presence of bypass surgery including sternotomy
wires and multiple surgical clips in the left-sided anterior
mediastinum consistent with the procedure.
There remain some linear basal densities on the bases and mild
blunting of
both lateral pleural sinuses, slightly more on the left than on
the right.
This corresponds to minor blunting also of the posterior pleural
sinuses seen on the lateral view. Evidence of sizeable left
lower lobe atelectasis that existed previous postoperative
examinations has disappeared. No new pulmonary abnormalities are
present and no significant pulmonary ongestive pattern is
identified.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory postoperative findings. Minor pleural
blunting
remains but no significant atelectasis or infiltrates are
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70-year-old man with a history of
hypertension, presenting with unstable angina and a
catheterization showing 3-vessel-disease including proximal LAD
lesion.  Balloon pump was placed resulting in cessation of chest
pain.  He was taken to the operating room on [**7-31**] and underwent
a coronary artery bypass grafting times three (LIMA to LAD, SVG
to ramus/OM/PDA) p
