Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Hip Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Endotracheal Intubation
- Central Venous Line
- Arterial Line
- Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter


History of Present Illness:
57M w hx of IVDU, endocarditis, recent diagnosis of cutaneous
lupus treated only with cream, presenting w/ severe left hip
pain. Approx 5 days ago, had 3 days of nausea, vomiting,
diahrrea which he claims was secondary to eating bad steak tips,
these symptoms have resoved. resolved. Nausea was consistency of
coffee grounds per patient. No gross blood, No blood in his
stool. He also reported general malaise which persisted. Approx
2 days ago, developed severe left hip pain, worse with walking
and movement, and worsened despite taking ibuprofen and tylenol.
Hip ROM severely limited with flexion and extension [**1-29**] pain,
ABduction and ADduction more or less preserved. No obvious
erythema or deformity. Denied fevers, night sweats, chills. he
is unsure when he last used IV heroin, reporting it may have
been 1 week or several months ago.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T97.6 P101 BP 107/65 R 17 O2 sat 98%
RA. The patient had a CXR which showed right lung opacity
concerning for pneumonia. Multiple lab abnormalities were also
present, including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, elevated
creatinine to 2.2, thrombocytopenia with plts of 21, bandemia of
24, elevated LFTs. Also, INR 1.5 and PTT 100. Patient was given
vancomycin, levaquin, ceftriaxone, and 3.5 liters of fluid.
Orhopedics saw patient and recommended pelvis CT, which was
unrevealing, though limited because it was without contrast.
RUQUS was also done which was negative for cholecystitis,
negative son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) **]. However, multiple hyperechoic
splenic lesions were identified. After 3.5l of fluid the
patient's heart rate increased to 130's, RR increased to 40's. A
right EJ and left IJ were placed. Also received 40mEq Potassium,
ativan 1mg IV x1, morphine 4mg IV X2.

--------------------

RUQ US [**10-22**]: No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
Small gallbladder polyp. Otherwise unremarkable study.

WBC SCAN [**10-17**]: Focal areas of increased radiotracer uptake
projecting over site of known cavitary lesions on recent chest
CT involving the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe most
compatible with lung abscesses.

CT-TORSO [**10-16**]: 1. New right pneumothorax. In a patient with
risk of lung necrosis from complicating infection, differential
diagnosis includes possibility of bronchopleural fistula,
although less likely. Correlate with history of recent
instrumentation. 2. Innumerable cavitary lesions within the
lungs for which the differential diagnosis includes septic
emboli, cavitary pneumonia such as staphylococcus, or less
likely metastasis or acute presentation of Wegner's
granulomatosis. There is interval improvement of air
opacification in the lungs. Interval improvement of appearance
of the pleural effusion, with remaining small right pleural
effusion. 3. Splenic hypodense lesions some could be
hemangiomas; however in keeping with lung findings cannot
exclude septic emboli. 4. Lytic small iliac lesions bilaterally,
incompletely characterized on this study. 5. Multiple bilateral
cystic lesions in the kidneys, likely simple cysts.

MR HEAD [**10-10**]: 1. Multiple small lesions scattered throughout
the bilateral frontal and parietal lobes with varying degrees of
restricted diffusion representing infarcts of varying ages, very
likely embolic and related to known bacterial endocarditis.
There is no hemorrhage.
2. Series of lesions within the paramedian right frontal and
temporo-occipital regions, which appear more acute and may
represent watershed infarcts, in the appropriate clinical
setting (ie. acute [relative] hypotensive event]; there is no
evidence of vascular territorial infarction. 3. Scattered
punctate lesions in the posterior frontal lobes, bilaterally,
corresponding to some of the older foci of resolving restricted
diffusion, above, and likely representing septic emboli. There
is no evidence of microabscess or pathologic leptomeningeal
enhancement. 4. There is no evidence of cerebral venous
thrombosis.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**10-10**]: 1. C6-7: Findings involving the contiguous
endplates, intervening disc and annuloligamentous complexes,
characteristic of vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis, in this
clinical setting. Though there is no epidural phlegmon or
discrete abscess, there is a likely focal phlegmon in the left
anterolateral prevertebral space, subjacent to that longus [**Last Name (un) **]
muscle, at the C6 level. 2. C5-6: Contiguous findings, though
less marked, are suspicious for a second level of involvement
with discitis/vertebral osteomyelitis; again, no discrete
epidural phlegmon or abscess is seen. 3. No non-contiguous
vertebral involvement, elsewhere in the imaged spine. 4. Normal
cervical spinal cord caliber and intrinsic signal intensity,
with no pathologic leptomeningeal or intramedullary enhancement.


CT HEAD [**9-22**]: Since the CT head of four days prior, there is
increased
conspicuity of subcortical white matter hypodensities which are
bilateral but slightly more prominent on the right. Etiology is
indeterminate. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging and
post-contrast imaging is recommended for further assessment.

TEE [**9-18**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. No atrial septal defect
