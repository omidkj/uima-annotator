History of Present Illness:
41 yr old female w/ PMH of ETOH-induced cirrhosis ([**2157**]) +
pancreatitis, admitted to [**Hospital 17436**] hospital in mid-[**Month (only) 205**] with 3 day
hx of RUQ pain, increasing abdominal girth, N/V, jaundice and
one-month history of anorexia.  She reports that she stopped
drinking 2 weeks prior to admission.  Her admission labs were as
follows:  Na 140, K 3, Cl 92, CO2 29, BUN 6, Cr 0.7, Gluc 93, AG
19, Ca 8.1, TP 8.1, Alb 4.0, Bilitot 17.3, AST 165, ALT 36, AP
390, amylase 52, lipase 422, ammonia 67, ETOH <0.01, WBC 5.3,
Hct 33.5, Plt 38, NEU 75.8%, MCV 95.2, PT 17.8, INR 1.8, PTT 43.
Abd U/S and CT showed a cirrhotic liver w/ possible liver mass
in right lobe, fluid in the right and left gutters, ascites.
Paracenteses were performed on [**2160-6-30**] (1L) and [**2160-7-2**] (3L)
without evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (clear,
yellow, WBC 35, RBC few, NEU 12, LYMPH 16, MESOS 2, Alb <0.4, TP
<1.0, gram stain polys, no organisms, no growth), but Pt was
started empirically on ceftriaxone.  ABG [**2160-7-3**] 7.34/32/64.
During the course of her hospitalization she went from being
able to answer questions to being confused/agitated, at first
thought to be secondary to ETOH and benzo withdrawal and treated
using sedatives, however she progressed to her current state of
being confused/somnolent. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.   The day before transfer labs were as follows: BUN
24, Cr 1.0, AG 9, Alb 2.6, AST 159, ALT47, AP 245, Bilitot 34,
INR rose to 2.1 and is now 1.8 after vitamin K tx, PT 17.9, WBC
13.7, Hct 27.9, Plt 134.

##HEMOCHROMATOSIS ANALYSIS:  COPPER, SERUM 1354 (wnl [**Telephone/Fax (1) 58023**]
UG/L); HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS GENE ANALYSIS: Negative for
C282Y mutation. Negative for H63D mutation; CERULOPLASMIN  37
(wnl 18 -53 MG/DL)
##[**Doctor First Name **] negative

##ABXR [**2160-7-9**]:IMPRESSION: NGT seen entering stomach before
passing out of view of image.
##CXR [**2160-7-9**]:IMPRESSION: Appropriate positioning of PICC line
with tip in the distal SVC. No acute cardiopulmonary process
observed.
##CXR [**2160-7-11**]:IMPRESSION: Nasogastric tube terminates in the
distal stomach. Paucity of gas within imaged portion of the
abdomen. This raises the possibility of ascites.
##CT ABD [**2160-7-11**]: IMPRESSION:
1) Shrunken and nodular liver parenchyma with heterogeneous
enhancement, consistent with cirrhosis. Portal hypertension,
gastroesophageal varices and a splenorenal shunt are also
present.
2) No evidence of a focal hepatoma.
3) Patent hepatic arteries, portal vein, and hepatic veins.
4) Diffuse abdominal ascites.
5) Crossed and fused ectopia of the kidneys, as discussed above.
6) Diffuse wall thickening of the colon and rectum, likely
secondary to the patient's low albumin state and liver failure.
Clinical correlation is recommended to help exclude an
infectious/inflammatory etiology.

##CT HEAD [**2160-7-11**]:  There is no shift of normally midline
structures. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids are
normally aerated.  There are no lytic or destructive changes of
the skull. Please note that the examination is limited and that
the most superior aspect of the brain is not included in the
area examined.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect
##U/S ABD [**2160-7-29**]: 1) Cirrhosis, with changes of portal
hypertension and reversal of blood flow. 2) Mild gallbladder
wall thickening, probably related to the patient's cirrhotic
state.

##CXR [**2160-7-13**]:IMPRESSION:1. Recent intubation. 2. Right upper
lobe infiltrate with left lower lobe atelectatic changes.

##[**Last Name (un) **]-INTESTINAL TUBE PLACEMENT (W/FLUORO)[**2160-7-16**]:IMPRESSION:
Successful placement of postpyloric feeding tube. Tip is in the
first portion of the duodenum.

##CXR [**2160-7-29**]: PICC tip in proximal right atrium. No evidence of
pneumonia
##BLOOD CX: 8/21-23-24/04:  all no growth

##STOOL CULTURE: 8/21-23-24/04:  no C. Diff, Campylobacter,
Shigella, Salmonella

Brief Hospital Course:
At arrival Pt's affect ranged from somnolent to aggitated and
confused, requiring that she be placed in restraints.  She was
given haldol 2.5 mg q4h prn for aggitation.  She was immediately
put on lactulose q1h and was transitioned to NGT administration
of all food and meds. Ceftriaxone 1 g Q24h for empiric coverage
of possible sbp, but was stopped after one day secondary to
paracentesis (~200cc) results (LDH 33, TP 0.6, alb < 1.0,
glucose 162, creatinine 1.1,  WBC 175, RBC 675, polys 8%, lymph
2%, monos 89%, 1+ <1 per 1000X FIELD POLYMORPHONUCLEAR
LEUKOCYTES. NO MICROORGANISMS) indicating no sbp. CT of head
ruled-out cranial bleed. Liver mass characterized on CT was
found to be negative for malignant cells on cytology.  Pt was in
wards [**7-9**] - [**7-12**], MICU [**7-12**] - [**7-17**], wards [**7-17**] - [**8-1**].  Hospital
care by problem was as follows:
