Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
near falling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, PEG tube


History of Present Illness:
Per admitting resident:

Patient is a 61 yo man with hx of occasionally elevated BP
but not on any anti-hypertensive who presented to [**Hospital3 **] around midnight after a near-fall at home.  Per
patient's girlfriend/HCP, she came home late after school and
found him watching television.  While she went to wash up
upstairs, he reportedly went to the bathroom to urinate then she
heard a "thud, thud" and found him leaning next to a fall but
awake and conversant although appeared confused.  She laid him
down on the floor and put a pillow under his head then proceeded
to call 911.  Then she came back with 2 ASA with water, he
coughed a bit but was able to swallow the pills.  She called 911
again and the EMS arrived and took him to [**Hospital3 **].

Per report, he was quite hypertensive initially (213/133) with L
sided weakness and slurring of speech but answering questions
appropriately.  Head CT revealed large R BG hemorrhage (3X7cm)
with some midline shift to the left.  Patient developed
nausea/vomiting hence was intubated for airway protection prior
to being med-flighted here for further care.

NSURG reviewed the films and given no signs of hydrocephalus,
did
not intervene.  Patient remains intubated and sedated with
Propofol.
