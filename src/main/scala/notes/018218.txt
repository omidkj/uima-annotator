the CCU today from Dr.[**Name (NI) 7914**] clinic for medical treatment
of volume overload.  According to the patient's daughter, his
primary complaint is fatigue.  He feels "whole body" fatigue
with minimal exertion.  He was able to walk approximately 5
minutes without fatigue in the past, however recently has
required resting for minimal movement including going from
sitting to standing position.  The patient reports improvement
of BL LE edema, however increased amount of ascites.  The
daughter also reports decreased appetite.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  CHF exacerbation:  Biventricular failure secondary to
ischemic cardiomyopathy, right sided failure secondary to left
sided failure. The patient has severe tricuspid regurgitation,
moderate mitral and aortic regurgitation on recent TTE.  The
patient does not have typical CHF symptoms considering his
severe TR.  His symptomatic equivalent is fatigue and whole body
weakness.  It seems that he has progressed over the past few
months from Stage 3 NYHA classification to Stage 4, with
symptoms with minimal exertion/rest.  On admission, the patient
was very volume overloaded.  He was treated with IV lasix drip
with good diuresis.  Diuresis with lasix drip was initiated,
with weaning and placement on torsemide 80mg PO daily he did not
have adequate urine output and was thus placed back on the lasix
gtt until discharge. As his BPs were low with the lasix gtt a
PICC line was placed and dopamine was initiated to maintain
adequate blood pressures while aggressive diuresis. He was
continued on digoxin. Held carvedilol initially given attempt at
diuresis and risk of hypotension, however then this medication
were reinitiated to help control AF.  Held midodrine and
aminophylline given dopamine treatment and risk of
tachyarrhytmias initially, then once weaned off dopamine, these
medications were restarted.  Aminophylline was increased to
100mg [**Hospital1 **].  His torsemide was increased to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for
discharge.  He also was instructed to take metolazone daily
prior to his AM dose of torsemide. Lasix drip was continued
untill discharge when he was sent home on metolazone and
torsemide.

2. Atrial Flutter:  The patient has been in atrial fibrillation
regardless of attempts at chemical cardioversion with amiodarone
in the past.  It appeared on 12 lead from admission that the
patient is in atrial flutter at a rate of 150bpm.   Continued
amiodarone.  Continued carvedilol.  Continued coumadin,
monitored INR daily.

3. CAD s/p CABG:  Continued simvastatin, aggrenox. Coreg was
held given hypotension initially and then re-started.

4. History of TIAs: Continued aggrenox.

5. BPH: Continued flomax, with holding parameters.

6. Cataracts: Continued opthalmic treatments including predfort,
acular, zymar, and cosopt.

7. Gout:  Continued colchicine

8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient's daughter reports that they did
not initiate levothyroxine therapy given unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] results.
TSH elevated but T4 and free T3 within normal limits. Did not
make any changes to medications.

9. Long term goal: Palliative care was involved and discussion
with patient and family took place re: long term goals of care.
The decision to eventually go home with home care, and think
about hospice care in the future.
