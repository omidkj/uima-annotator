Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8739**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, diplopia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Plasmapheresis
left femoral CVL placement
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70 year old woman with a history of myasthenia
[**Last Name (un) 2902**] now presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath.
She is a fair historian in some discomfort so details are
limited.  About 2 weeks ago she began to feel intermittant left
sided chest pain that radiates into her left arm and jaw.  She
describes the pain as dull and pressure-like in the chest and
sharper in the arm.  She also experienced shortness of breath
and has become increasingly less mobile in this time period.
She visited her PCP last week who was planning on arranging a
stress test for her.  She was also complaining of a cough and
upper respiratory symptoms; she was treated with a
cephalosporin.  Over this past week, her symptoms of fatigue and
pain have worsened.  Today, she visited her PCP and could barely
walk into the office.  He arranged for her to be taken to the
ED.  She feels her eyes have been a bit more droopy in this time
period as well.  She complains of some diplopia.  In the ED, her
NIF is -20 and her vital capacity is 1.35.

She has a history of myasthenia since [**2118**], has been intubated
in the past for similar symptoms ([**1-24**] lifetime intubations).
Some of her symptoms include ptosis, double vision and shortness
of breath.  Her last intubation was in [**2129**] and was prolonged,
requiring a trach; she developed a DVT from a femoral line
placed for pheresis.  According to her outpatient neurologist,
she has done well on Cellcept and Mestinon, in general.  She has
failed Imuran, Cyclosporin and Cytoxan.  Steroids have produced
more side effects than benefit for her.  Respiratory illnesses
have triggered crises in the past.

Her last hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2177**] was in [**8-26**] when she had
presented with weakness, shortness of breath and chest pain -
she had responded to Mestinon 30 mg; she also was noted to have
an adjustment disorder by psychiatry consult with anxiety and
perseveration on "staying alive" exacerbating her symptoms; she
had been discharged home on the same regimen for the myasthenia
at the time (cellcept and mestinon) and also with some low-dose
klonopin 0.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  She has not been taking the Klonopin, as
she has not felt that she needed it.  She has not been admitted
to the hospital for at least 12 months prior to her last visit
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66083**], which was in [**9-27**].

CTPA:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Although the bolus for the
aorta is somewhat limited, no signs of thoracic aortic
dissection are seen.
2. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
3. 1.7-cm calcified nodule or conglomeration of multiple small
calcified stones (? clustered within a calyceal diverticulum) at
the upper pole of the right kidney.

CXR:
FINDINGS: The patient is status post CABG with median
sternotomy. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
Left basilar atelectasis, however, no definite consolidation is
seen.

Note is made of surgical staples overlying the right upper
quadrant. There is 1.7 cm calcified density overlying the right
upper quadrant, representing kidney stones.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. 1.7 cm rounded calcified
opacity overlying the right upper quadrant, probably
representing kidney stone.

REPEAT CXR [**2-11**]:
SUPINE PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is interval placement
of an endotracheal tube terminating at the thoracic inlet.

There is interval development of a left retrocardiac opacity. No
evidence of pneumothorax. Right lung is grossly clear.

[**2-13**]:
CHEST PORTABLE: Comparison is made to a prior study of [**2133-2-11**].
The heart size is in the upper limits of normal. The mediastinal
and hilar contours are unchanged. The pulmonary vasculature is
unremarkable. Again noted is the retrocardiac opacity, which is
stable in appearance. No new consolidation. A left central
venous line is seen with its tip in the distal SVC. The ET tube
is identified 1.7 cm from the carina. A feeding tube is seen
passing through the stomach, the tip of which is not depicted on
this film.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left central venous line with its tip in the distal SVC.
2. No change in the appearance of the heart and lungs with
persistent retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis
versus consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo woman with MG dxd [**2119**], followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66083**] at [**Hospital1 2177**],
hx of hospitalizations with 3-4 intubations in past (last [**2129**],
with prolonged intubation requiring trach, complicated by DVT
from pheresis cath) who had URI for past 2 wks, treated with
cephalosporin who p/w worsening cp, sob, diplopia and ptosis.
In ED, she was using accessory muscles, unable to keep neck or
limbs up. NIF -20 and VC 1.35l; she was intubated electively.
She had a cta with no PE.

1. Neuro -
-After discussion with neuromuscular department as well as email
correspondence with outpatient neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66083**], opted to
treat with IVIG (no steroids - patient has had more
complications than benefits in the past).  This was started
within 24 hours of hospitalization.
-Temperature spiked to 102 with IVIG - cultures were sent to
rule out infection, and IVIG was held for one hour and restarted
at a slower rate according to blood bank recommendations.  She
continued to have fevers with administration of IVIG, but
premedication with tylenol, benadryl and ranitidine helped.
-Cellcept was
