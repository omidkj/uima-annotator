.
([**2125-2-17**]) CXR Portable AP: Compared to the prior study, there
has been no significant change in the moderate cardiomegaly.
There is hazy bilateral pulmonary vasculature suggesting fluid
overload/CHF. Retrocardiac opacity suggestive of a hiatal hernia
is again seen. There is no focal infiltrate
.
([**2125-2-17**]) Gallbladder U/S: 1. Choledocholithiasis causing
biliary obstruction. 2. Cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall
edema and nonmobile stones at neck, likely representing acute
cholecystitis.
.
([**2125-2-17**]) ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Left bundle-branch block. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
.
([**2125-2-18**]) ERCP: IMPRESSION: Two filling defects within the
common bile duct, consistent with CBD stones, associated with
CBD and hepatic duct dilatation
.
([**2125-2-19**]) ECHO: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.  2. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is difficult to assess but is probably
somewhere between
normal to mildly depressed. No specific wall motion abnormality
could be
determined. 3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 4. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderatel ([**12-18**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen, which was dificult to quantify. 5.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
([**2125-2-21**]) Colonoscopy: Polyp in the transverse colon Otherwise
normal colonoscopy to cecum
.
([**2125-2-21**]) EGD: Erythema and erosion in the antrum and stomach
body compatible with gastritis; Large hiatal hernia; A localized
erosion was noted within the hiatal hernia sac, possibly a
[**Location (un) 25056**] erosion.
Otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum
.
([**2125-2-21**]): UGI Series with SBFT: UPPER GI: There is a large
paraesophageal hernia which persisted throughout the
examination. Gastroesophageal reflux was observed during the
exam. The gastric mucosa is unremarkable although evaluation was
slightly limited due to limited patient mobility. No ulcers,
filling defects, or abnormalities and peristalsis were
identified. The duodenal bulb and duodenal sweep are
unremarkable. A plastic biliary stent is identified. SMALL BOWEL
EXAM: Contrast passed freely through the small bowel into the
colon within 90 minutes. The small bowel is normal in caliber,
contour, and mucosal pattern. No filling defects or strictures
are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large paraesophageal hernia which persisted throughout the
examination.
2. Normal small bowel exam.
.
([**2125-2-22**]): P-MIBI: IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion.
2. The ventricular ejection fraction is 47%.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 61 year-old female with HTN, Anemia who was
transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with cholangitis and anemia,
clinically doing well. The following issues were addressed
during her hospital stay:
.
# CHOLANGITIS
Patient underwent ERCP with successful placement of Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **]
biliary stent, and bile was seen draining into the duodenum. Due
to difficulties with sedation, sphincterotomy was not performed.
Patient to return for repeat ERCP in [**1-19**] weeks time for
sphincterotomy and stone extraction. Surgery team evaluated
patient post-ERCP for cholecystectomy; given overall good
clinical appearance, elective cholecystectomy was recommended
once acute issues resolved. Abdominal exam was subsequently
benign. Patient was started on 14 days Levofloxacin/Flagyl for
empiric gut flora coverage. For pre-operative risk assessment,
ECHO and p-MIBI were performed, revealing no significant
valvular abnormalities; EF was preserved, and resting/stress
myocardial perfusion was normal -- given these findings, patient
at low risk for perioperative cardiac events, and she was
already on a beta-blocker as part of her anti-hypertensive
regimen. Outpatient appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was arranged.

.
# ANEMIA
Patient presented with Hct of 15 in setting of cholangitis and
guiaic positive stool. Iron studies consistent with iron
deficiency anemia. Hemolysis labs were negative. SPEP/UPEP
negative. EGD/Colonoscopy were performed to evaluate for source
of bleed. Colonoscopy showed small polyp which was resected,
otherwise normal. EGD showed findings consistent with gastritis,
as well has large hiatal hernia with localized erosion within
hernia sac ([**Location (un) 25056**] ulcer). Anemia was attributed to iron
deficiency anemia in setting of gastritis/erosions, and oral
iron/folate supplementation was initiated, as was PPI.
.
# HIATAL HERNIA
Hiatal hernia was seen on endoscopy, and UGI series with SBFT
was advised for further evaluation. UGI series with SBFT
confirmed that hernia was paraesophageal, necessitating surgical
intervention. Surgery team was contact[**Name (NI) **] and esophageal
manometry studies were recommended prior to intervention - these
were set-up as outpatient. We were hopeful that surgery could be
performed at same time as cholecystectomy; patient to follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# LBBB
On presentation, patient's EKG with LBBB, no old for comparison.
Patient was ruled out for ACS with negative serial enzymes.
Aspirin was held on admission in setting of Hct 15 and guiaic
positive stool. p-MIBI was normal.

# MIGRAINES
Not active currently, on Fioricet at home.
.
# HTN
Managed with Lisinopril and Metoprolol, added after bleeding
issues resolved
