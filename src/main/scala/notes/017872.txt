DOE, chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 35 year-old man who has a h/o palpitations/SVT for over
10 years s/p ablation of two left sided accessory pathways in
[**2117-9-20**] who now presents with SVT with chest pressure and SOB.
.
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1565**] last OMR note in [**4-19**], "these were
documented to be a long RP tachycardia, which turned out to be
in a left-sided accessory pathway. (From [**2117-1-6**] to [**2117-1-28**]
the pt underwent a Pt Activated [**Name (NI) 99007**] Recorder that made note of
episodes of Afib that occurred right after runs of rapid SVT
with brief conversion to sinus. Prominent ST depressions were
noted during these episodes also. The majority of the episodes
were a long RP tachycardia that occasionally degenerated into
atrial fibrillation.) He underwent a mapping and ablation of his
pathway in [**2117-9-13**], localized to two locations on the
left side of the mitral annulus. These were ablated. For the
following seven months, he was free of symptoms whatsoever. He
then began to develop a recurrence of palpitations, however,
these were distinctly different than his supraventricular
tachycardia. They were less intense and shorter in duration. In
retrospect, he felt a similar feeling after some of his more
typical SVT episodes prior to his ablation. Further monitoring
([**4-19**]) found that he is having runs of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. He occasionally has a narrow complex tachycardia
preceding this, which looks like an atrial tachycardia, perhaps
the pulmonary vein etiology. In general, he is doing quite well
with these and only has enduring periods of heightened stress.
When relaxed, he seems to be very quiescent from any arrhythmia
standpoint."
.
Pt. had been in his usual state of health until last night
before admission when he couldn't sleep, feeling subjectively
hot and cold. He developed chest pressure when lying on left
chest starting roughly around MN. He also notes DOE, feeling
winded when climbing one flight of stairs. He took atenolol 50
mg PRN (he takes PRN); however, symptoms persisted until he saw
his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 6PM, who noted SVT with rate of 170, and sent him to
ED. Possible triggers recently include several stressors in his
life, URI symptoms (earache), recent etOH on Saturday, 2 cups of
coffee daily chronically.
.
In ED, had unsuccessful cardioversion attempted with ibutilide,
successfully converted with 200J without complication. CXR
showed mild pulmonary edema. EP consulted and recommended
atenolol 50 mg qd and observation. During obs, his HR increased
to 150s with oxygen sats in 90-93% on room air. This rhythm was
noted to be aflutter. He received propafenone 600 mg X1 and was
cardioverted again (200J) to sinus rhythm. His CXR is suggestive
of mild pulmonary edema and resting sats 92% on 8L NC. Per EP,
he will continue propafenone 150mg q8hours and possible ablation
in am.
.
In CCU, he reports feeling slightly better. he is still c/o mild
left chest pressure only when he leans on L side. +mild SOB with
talking. No sensation of palpitattions, LHD, dizzyness. he does
feel very tired as he has not slept in 48 hrs.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 45 cm from the incisors. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen
on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: No thrombus, masses, or vegetations identified. No
PFO/ASD. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The following issues were dealt with on this admission:
.
# Rhythm: On the evening of [**2-20**] the patient went into rapid
atrial flutter with a rate in the 150's.  He did not respond to
a diltiazem drip, so he was started on procainamide following
cardioversion, and then propafenone.  He continued to have
tachyarrhythmias on this regimen, and was started on amiodarone
and esmolol drips on [**11-25**].  He did quite well on this
regimen, and converted to sinus rhythm, with intermittent bouts
of atrial fibrillation that were not sustained.  He was
transitioned to a po regimen of amiodarone and metoprolol on
[**2-25**], which he tolerated well.
.
# Pump: Patient presented with signs and symptoms of pulmonary
edema, confirmed on CXR and CT, which was thought to be
secondary to a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in the setting
of his arrhythmia.  An echocardiogram was ordered, and was wnl,
and this was followed up with a cardiac MR (read pending on
discharge).  The edema was severe enough to req
