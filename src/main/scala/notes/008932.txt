Imaging:
CT Head:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
CXR:
IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion with left basilar
atelectasis --
cannot exclude pneumonia. Consider lateral view to better
assess.
LUE US:
FINDINGS: Suboptimal and inconclusive study. The patient is
weak,
uncomfortable and difficult to cooperate with arm positioning.
There is normal compressibility in the left internal jugular
vein, axillary vein, and brachial veins. Unable to obtain
diagnostic images of the subclavian vein due to arm positioning.
Unable to see the cephalic and basilic vein. There is moderate
soft tissue edema in the left arm.

Discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] while on the floor during the
portable
ultrasound; study can be repeated in the morning if patient able
to cooperate with arm positioning.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Pleasant [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with MMP, now admitted
for hypotension in the setting of bilateral LE ulcers, new
consolidation on CXR, and positive C. Diff assay.
.
1. Hypotension: There was concern for septic shock given her
history of infection, positive C. Diff assay, LE ulcers, and new
consolidation on CXR. The patient, however had no fever, cough,
or sputum production, which made PNA less likey. Given her
cardiac history, there was concern for cardiogenic shock,
however there were no sxs to suggest recent MI, EKG is unchanged
and no edema on CXR. There was a low suspicion for PE, however
if with UE edema some concern for clot which may have
propogated. The patient patient was confirmed DNR/DNI, and no
additional lines were placed.  She was given IVF in addition to
antibiotic coverage for presumed sepsis, but she remained
persistently hypotensive.  The family was notified that she
would require additional access for IV fluids.  The family
reiterated there request for no additional lines, and she was
placed on comfort measures.  The patient passed comfortably just
before midnight at approximately 11:56 on [**2199-7-1**].
.
# ARF: Her creatinine was elevated in the setting of a urine
sodium of less than 10.  She was most likely pre-renal in the
setting hypotension.  She was given fluids, through her lines,
but remained persistently hypotensive.
.
# Abd pain: She had mild pain, with mild distension.  Her white
count was elevated and her c. diff was positive, which was the
most likely etiology for her pain and clinical presentation of
sepsis.
.
# LE ulcers: A small 1 cm circumscribed ucler was noted on the
foot which expressed small amounts of puss.  Foot x-rays were
not suggestive of osteo.
.
# Hyponatremia: Her low sodium was liklely secondary to poor PO
intake,  and she appeared dry on admission.  Fluids were started
as soon as she arrived.
.
# LUE edema: concerning for DVT vs thrombophlebitis, however no
hx of recent line in the LUE.  A LUE US was inconclusive.
.
# GERD: She was placed on an H2 blocker since she was also
taking plavix.
