Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old female h/o CVA, baseline mental status
non-communicative, on TPN, aspiration precaution, h/o UTI
(klebseilla and pseudomonas), h/o mucus plugging, admitted for
PICC malfunction, now w/ acute respiratory distress of unclear
etiology.
.
# hypoxic repiratory distress-This was thought to be most likely
due to mucus plugging vs aspiration. Her EKG was not suggestive
of ischemic causes. Initial ABG 7.48/31/53 on 100% NRB was
suggestive of significant hypoxemia. She received respiratory
suctioning which produced significant amt of thick secretion.
Her O2 sats improved from 85 on room air initially to high 90s
on 100 NRB to 99-100 on shovel mask on [**8-15**]. She was briefly
given vancomycin/flagyl along with ceftazdiime (already given
for empiric UTI treatment). This was stopped on days 2 ([**8-15**]) of
her ICU stay as her oxygenation improved and her hypoxic episode
thought to be related to mucus plugging. By time of discharge
she was breathing well with normal oxygenation on room air.
.
#UTI - She was initially started on ceftazdime given recent
hospitalization/ pseudomonas UTI/ chronic foley cath. Her urine
on followup revealed poly-flora oganism thought to be chronic
colonization given her chronic in-dwelling foley. THe foley was
changed on admission. Ceftaz was d/c on day 2 as she was not
thought to have UTI.
.
#Anemia-Her hct remained stable while she was in the hospital.
.
# FEN: The patient is TPN dependent at baseline secondary to her
her neurologic defecits.  After changing her PICC line, she
received daily TPN in consultation with the nutritionists.
.

#Access- She initially came in for malfunction of PICC. A new R
PICC was place in her antecubital area
.
# Code status- Extensive discussion was healed with the husband
and he agreeed that she can be intubated if needed, but do not
resucitate - this plan was made effective on [**2181-8-14**].
.
# Dispo: the patient was discharged to home with services.
