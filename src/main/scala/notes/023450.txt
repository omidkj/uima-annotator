Pertinent Results:
imaging:

[**2133-12-5**] CT head w/o contrast
There is increased density along the tentorium and posterior to
cerebellum (best seen on sagittal reformats) suggestive of small
subdural hematoma. There is small quadrigeminal cistern this can
be related to patient's young age or due to mild cerebral edema.


[**2133-12-5**] CT c-spine w/o contrast
No fracture or subluxation in cervical spine.

[**2133-12-5**] CTA aorta/bifem/iliac
1. Severe open-book deformity of the left hemipelvis with wide
space
symphyseal distraction and SI joint diastasis, associated with
left common
iliac artery disruption and distal nonperfusion of the left
lower extremity.  No active extravasation. This is associated
with severe left inguinal laceration, extensive subcutaneous
emphysema, and a large left retroperitoneal hematoma extending
along left psoas muscle, extending into posterior left
hemiabdomen.
2. Comminuted and displaced left distal femur fracture.
3. Mild pulmonary contusion, in combination with aspiration and
atelectasis.
4. No solid organ injury.

[**2133-12-5**] CT head without contrast - repeat 5 pm
1. Stable density along the tentorium and posterior cerebellum
