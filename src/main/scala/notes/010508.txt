History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 79-year-old male with with critical AS (valve
area <0.8cm2) recently evaluated by CT surgery for his aortic
stenosis and aortic dilatation, found to have a PNA requiring
recent hospitalization when he was treated with levofloxacin,
and subsequently discharged on [**2130-3-23**]. He presents on this
admission with worse dyspnea and weakness. He reports that he
has had stable dyspnea for past month, and on discharge on [**3-23**]
he felt "better." Then, only a day later on [**3-24**] the patient
felt fatigued, had no appetite, and developed a "drowning"
sensation when he couldn't cough up his phlegm. Otherwise he

DOE, and endorses stable two pillow orthopnea. Denies melena,
hematemesis, dysuria, hematuria, nausea or vomiting .

In the ED, initial vs were: 97.8 119/46, 108, 28, 94% sat on 2L.
CXR showed worsening of left-sided pna. Patient was given IV
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, vancomycin and ASA 325mg in ED.
Initial labs were notable for lactate of 3.3, WBC 14, and Na
120. The patient's blood pressure dropped to 84/65 and he got
700 cc IVF (total incl abx) with and improvement in BP to 90/61
with heart rate of 102, RR 28 and oxygen satuations 99%4L. The
patient's case was discussed with CT surgery.
