Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
inappropriate rhythm sensing by ICD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD lead replacement [**7-9**]
cardioversion [**7-9**]


History of Present Illness:
For more details, please see admission note from [**2198-7-4**]. In
brief, this is a 83 y/o male with h/o CAD, s/p MI x 2, s/p CABG
in [**2186**], with history of syncope possibly [**1-8**] to NSVT, s/p ICD
placement for primary prevention in [**2184**]. He presented with
inappropriate sensing of his ICD.

He was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] from [**2198-6-29**] to [**2198-7-3**] for a LLL CAP
that did not respond to out-patient treatment with z-pak. He was
treated with PO levaquin 750mg PO q48 (renally dosed) and
improved, with less fever, improved symptoms, and improved
leukocytosis. He was discharged [**7-3**] with one remaining dose of
levaquin ([**2198-7-4**]) and upon arriving home, his remote check
demonstrated 15 NSVT episodes, 6 VT-Mon episodes and one VF
episode since [**2198-4-6**]. He denied any symptoms of palpitations,
lightheadedness, or pre-syncope/syncope. He did not experience
any firing of his ICD. He was called by the device clinic and
told to come in for likely inappropriate sensing of
tachyarrhythmias. He was found to have a faulty lead/lead
fracture and his ICD was turned off and he was admitted to the
[**Hospital1 1516**] service. He was taken to the EP OR today, [**2198-7-9**] for lead
replacement. During the procedure, his RA lead was removed, he
went into atrial fibrillation, is s/p cardioversion, currently
in sinus rhythm. He lost about 1 unit of blood during the
procedure, but is clinically stable. A TEE was done during the
procedure and no evidence of pericardial effusion was found.
.
Of note his original NSVT episode presented with syncope. He has
never had another episode of syncope, and he has never felt his
ICD fire.

CXR: [**7-9**]->Previous consolidation in the right lung has improved
substantially above the level of the minor fissure, but not
below and should be investigated as a unresolving acute
pneumonia. Left infrahilar opacification is probably
atelectasis, but could be consolidation as well, and is more
pronounced today than on [**2198-7-4**]. Mild cardiomegaly is
stable. There is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion and no
pneumothorax or mediastinal widening. The lower portion of the
chest is excluded from this examination and the tips of 2
transvenous cardiac leads are not imaged. The proximal electrode
of the pacer defibrillator lead is in the SVC and left
brachiocephalic vein. Followup radiographs are needed.
Cardiology team was notified.

CXR: [**7-10**]->Mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement is stable. Right
lower lobe
consolidation has improved consistent with resolving pneumonia.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are
in standard placements. No pneumothorax. No appreciable pleural
effusion or pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 83 year old gentleman with a history of CAD s/p CABG
in [**2186**] and syncope likely [**1-8**] VT s/p ICD in [**2184**], recently
discharged from hospital for community acquired pneumonia, who
presented with a faulty ICD lead.
.
1. ICD lead fracture:  The patient lost 1 unit of blood during
his lead replacement procedure, but remained clinically stable.
His hematocrit remained stable and he did not require
transfusion.  A CXR was performed and showed that his leads were
properly positioned and he had no pneumothorax.  The EP fellow
checked the leads prior to discharge.  His post procedural pain
was treated with Tylenol Q6H with Oxycodone available PRN for
breakthrough pain
.
2. Atrial fibrillation:  The patient had an episode of Afib
during the lead replacement procedure and was cardioverted back
into sinus rhythm at that time.  He remained in sinus rhythm
throughout the remainder of his admission s/p cardioversion.  He
was started on Coumadin 5 mg daily and is INR=1.3 on discharge.
His INRs will be followed closely by his outpatient PCP and he
will require a total of 3 months of anticoagulation.
.
3. Community Acquired Pneumonia:  The patient was recently
discharged after treatment with 3 days of Levaquin for a
community acquired pneumonia.  His CXR on admission looked
significantly worse and he was given vanc/cefepime for 4 days
prior to the procedure being performed.  He showed marked
clinical improvement and was afebrile with no leukocytosis.  His
antibiotics were switched to cefpodoxime and azithromycin on [**7-9**]
following the procedure.  He will continue cefpodoxime for a 7
day course and azithromycin for a 5 day course.  His CXR was
dramatically improved on discharge.
.
4. Chronic Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure with an
EF=35-40% on TTE.  He was continued on Coreg, but
lisinopril/HCTZ was held as his blood pressure was initially
marginal and his creatinine was up to 1.5.
