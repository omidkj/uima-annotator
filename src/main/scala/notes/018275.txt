Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5301**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VATS on [**2-3**], s/p lung biopsy


History of Present Illness:
77 F w/ presumed ILD presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2134-1-27**] w/
sob and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for lung Bx s/p procedure doing well.
Two wks prior to presentation she had the onset of shortness of
breath and cough after just getting over viral gastroenteritis.
She went to her PCP and was treated with levofloxacin x 7 days.
.
Symptoms continued so she presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] [**1-27**] tachypnea
and hypoxia. Imaging suggested pneumonia and she started
empirically on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Despite treatment
she developed worsening hypoxia. Given concern for IPF
exacerbation she was started on solumedrol 80 mg IV q.6h and
then q8h with minimal response. On [**2134-1-31**] she and episode of
hypoxia with saturations falling to the mid 80s on 5 liters
requiring a nonrebreather but eventually weaned back down to 2
liters facemask. On [**2134-2-2**] she again had an acute episode of
hypoxia this time requiring BIPAP but responded to diuresis with
lasix.
.
As she had never had a lung bx to definitively dx her disease
she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for VATS lung bx. On arrival she
continued to have a 6L by nasal cannula O2 requirement to
maintain saturations >92%. She was continued on levofloxacin and
steroids despite low suspicion for infectious etiology. Pt
underwent VATS RLL wedge biopsy [**2-3**] which she tolerated well.
She underwent further diuresis and CT was removed [**2-5**].

Studies:
Pathology [**2134-2-3**] s/p VATS
DIAGNOSIS
Lung, right lower lobe, wedge resection:
a.  Patchy interstitial fibrosis, moderate to severe, with
honey-comb change, fibroblastic foci, and mild chronic
inflammation, see note.
b.  Organizing thrombi.
c.  Pleural adhesion.
.
Note:  The changes are consistent with usual interstitial
pneumonia (UIP)-reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **].  Clinical correlation
recommended.  Special stains for AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] fungi are
negative.
.
[**2134-2-4**] AP CXR: FINDINGS: There has been interval worsening of
moderate pulmonary edema on top of her chronic pulmonary
interstitial lung disease. There is no pneumothorax. There is
more right pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal contour is
obscured by the lung abnormality but is not enlarged.
IMPRESSION: Worsening moderate pulmonary edema.
.
[**2134-2-5**] AP CXR: IMPRESSION: Status post removal of chest tube
without pneumothorax. Decreased pulmonary edema. Stable diffuse
interstitial disease.
.
[**2134-2-10**] PA and lat CXR: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:
Compared to recent prior study the appearance of the diffuse
interstitial abnormality has changed slightly raising the
possibility of superimposed fluid overload, although it is
difficult to assess, and there are no pleural effusions.
Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Change in appearance of diffuse interstitial
abnormality raises the possibility of superimposed fluid
overload.
.
[**2134-2-15**] ECHO TTE: LVEF 60% with grade I diastolic dysfunction.
mild AS, 1+MR, moderate pulmonary hypertension with PASP =46.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6692**] is a 78 year old female who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
from an OSH for work up for hypoxia with h/o of presumed ILD.
She came to have a VATS for lung biopsy.  She spent two days in
the MICU after the procedure until the chest tube was removed.
She was then transferred to the floor. Brief hospital course is
described by problem list below.
.
# Hypoxia: She was treated at the OSH with antibiotics and
initially continued on them in house. These were subsequently
discontinued as she had no signs of pneumonia on CXR or with her
WBC initially.  Pathology from lung biopsy shows UIP/IDL and all
cultures from the tissue were negative including fungal
cultures.  Although she used no oxygen before her
hospitalization, she now requires baseline oxygen per nasal
cannula at 3-4L to keep oxygen saturation above 92%.  The cause
of the exacerbation is unknown; perhaps related to an infection
prior to hospitalization.  She still becomes tachypnic and
hypoxia with ambulation for which she will benefit from
pulmonary rehab.  Pulmonology was consulted and they have
recommended a month long prednisone taper (she is currently on
50mg daily), nebulizer treatments with albuterol and atrovent
and, mucomyst PO 600mg TID.  In addition, based on data from a
clinical trial, they recommended a 2 week course of enoxaparin
given the high ddimer value and the evidence of thrombus on the
pathology tissue.  This may help improve her symptoms.  She has
PFTs scheduled for the end of [**Month (only) 958**] ([**2134-3-8**]) and an appointment
the same day with her pulmonologist.  (please see appointments
section)
.
# fluid overload: She has no history of heart failure, but did
show some fluid overload on CXR. There was concern that her
tachycardia due to hypoxia (and maybe nebulizer treatments) may
contribute to strain on the heart and some failure. She
presented with a BNP in the 1100s at the OSH adn was 1241 on
admission to [**Hospital1 18**].  She has required occassional light diuresis
with furosemide 10mg IV with good outcome.  TTE showed LVEF of
60% with grade I diastolic dysfunction, mild AS, 1+MR and
evidence of pulmonary hypertension with an estimated PASP of 46.

.
# diarrhea: She had some episodes of diarrhea and an elevated
WBC, and therefore, was treated empirically with metronidazole
for 7 days.  Subsequent cultures showed she was C diff negative
x3.
.
# leukocytosis:  Her WBC bounces between 14 and 21 with no signs
of infections including remaining afebrile, no infiltrates on
CXR, clean u/a, no further diarrhea.  This is attributed to the
steroid treatment.
.
# hyperglycemia: She has no history of diabetes. This is likely
attributed to the prednisone.  She is currently on humalog with
meals and as a sliding scale.  The doses with meals is still
being titrated up to better control her blood glucose.  The
insulin doses will need to be decreased and even discontinued as
her prednisone taper ends to avoid hypoglycemia.
.
# HTN/tachycardia: She was admitted on norvasc and diovan.
Given her tachycardia and hypertension in house, she is
currrently controlled on amlodipine 5mg, valsartan 160mg [**Hospital1 **],
metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] with SBP ranging from 110-130's.  She has
still been occassionally tachycardic with ranges in heart rate
from 80-110's likely related to medications and perhaps to her
hypoxia.
