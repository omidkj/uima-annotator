History of Present Illness:
71 year-old female with a history of DMII, CVA [**2186**] with
residual LUE deficit/facial droop, seizure disorder, COPD, and
history of multiple infections including C diff on prolonged po
vanco taper, MRSA bacteremia, multiple UTIs, with recent
admission in [**9-/2195**] gastroenteritis who presented from NH
yesterday fever and hypoxia with sats to 80% and temp of 101.8.

In the ED VS were T 98  HR 89  BP 89/40  RR 18  91% on RA.  BP
dropped to 70's which resolved with 1L NS.  She again became
hypotensive  requiring levofed so she was admitted to the MICU.
She received an additional 4L IVF and was started on vanc, zosyn
and azithro.

In the ICU she was continued on vanc, zosyn and azithro for
concern for HCAP. She was quickly weaned off pressors and did
well overnight.  Repeat CXR this mornings shows worsending RLL
consolidation concerning for PNA.  Her blood cx grew out GNR
>100,000 organisms with no speciation yet.  Her viral screen was
legative as was legionella.  She was increased to treatment dose
of po vanc for her difficult to treat c. diff, toxin pending.

On evaluation in the ICU, patient reports she is feeling well
with no complaints.

MICRO:
Blood cx - negative
Urine cx - E.coli, sensitive to Cefepime
Legionella Ag - negative

Respiratory viral antigen screen - negative for Adeno,
Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, Influenza A, B, and RSV by
immunofluorescence.

IMAGING:
CXR ([**2195-12-23**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Low lung volumes.
2. Prominent bronchovascular markings could be partially due to
low lung
volumes, however, mild pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.
3. Right retrocardiac opacity, which may reflect atelectasis or
pneumonia.

CXR: [**2195-12-24**]
There is a right internal jugular line in situ the tip of which
lies in the distal SVC. The cardiomediastinal contour is normal.
There is
increased consolidation seen in the right lower lobe. No other
abnormality
seen.
.
Video swallow [**12-28**]:
FINDINGS: Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and
esophagus without
evidence of obstruction. There is no gross aspiration. Mild
penetration was
only observed during self administration of thin liquid. For
details, please
refer to speech and swallow division note in OMR.

IMPRESSION: Mild penetration with self administration of thin
liquids. Please
see speech and swallow note for further details.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 71 year-old female with a history of COPD/ASthma,
previous UTIs, C diff, and MSSA bacteremia as well as history of
stroke and AKA initially admitted to MICU for sepsis from urine
vs. pulmonary source now transferred to floor.
.
# Sepsis: Likely source urine with positive cx although
unusually the UA was negative. Urine culture grew out Ecoli -
sensitive to cefipime.  A CXR also showed a RLL infiltrate
possibly consistent with aspiration pneumonia. Ms. [**Known lastname 65716**] was
treated with Cefipime IV with good response.  Given her
difficult access and the need for iv abx, a PICC line was
placed.  She will need to complete a 10-day course of IV
cefepime (last dose on [**2196-1-1**]), at which time the PICC line
needs to be removed.
  Another potential source considered was her biliary tract.
She has known cholelithiasis and in the past has experienced
elevated LFTs.  For this admission, fortunately, her LFTs were
not significantly elevated and there was no RUQ tenderness.
   She continued on the oral vancomycin and the dose was
increased to treatment dose (q 6 hours) given concurrent
antibiotics, which needs to be continued for 2 weeks AFTER
completion of the cefepime.  At that time, vancomycin can then
be slowly tapered over several weeks.
.
# PNA:  Seen on CXR.  Given Ms. [**Known lastname 66570**] history of CVA and
appearance of infiltrates, aspiration was considered possible.
The nursing staff also noted several episodes of
coughing/choking after eating.  the Swallow team was consulted
and video swallow revealed that the patient is at risk for
aspiration, but had NO frank aspiration.  A diet of think
liquids with soft food and aspiration precuations were
recommended.  Nebulizers were also given.
