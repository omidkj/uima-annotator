Brief Hospital Course:
80M transferred from OSH (RI) for second opinion after having
LGI Bleed ([**2204-12-14**] BRBPR received 6U PRBC with negative
colonoscopy/EGD).

Has had two GIB in past ([**Month (only) **], and 2 weeks ago). Patient
has been in the hospital since [**2204-12-18**] with stable crit of 32,
however [**12-20**] AM had crit of 28 at 7am, repeat crit at 4pm showed
32, and 29.0 most recently.

On [**12-20**] - Pt sent to IR for Following intravenous injection of
autologous red blood cells   labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and
dynamic images of the abdomen for minutes   were obtained. A
left lateral view of the pelvis was also obtained after 60 and
95 minutes.

Blood flow images show normal vascular distribution pattern.

Dynamic blood pool images (obtained for 95 minutes) show no
areas of suspicious
tracer uptake. In patients with several episodes of GI bleeding
and no sites
identified on multiple GI bleeding scans, it is often helpful to
repeat the GI
bleeding scan beginning in the morning and following the
patients for the entire
day.

On [**12-21**] he developed massive intestinal hemorrhage with bright
red blood passing per rectum. He became extremely unstable
hemodynamically and was taken urgently to the
operating room.

Below id the sequence of events:

PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped
and draped urgently. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] opened the
abdomen. Upon entering the abdomen, it was clear that the
gastrointestinal tract was full of blood, particularly the
distal small bowel and the right colon. The patient was
extremely unstable with a blood pressure in the 40-50 range and
was requiring amounts of blood. The retractors were placed. The
triangular ligament of the left lobe of the liver was taken
down, lending access to the supraceliac aorta, and manual
compression was made of the
aorta at this location to allow some stabilization of the blood
pressure. This, however, proved unsuccessful.

The patient was then eviscerated to the right. The transverse
colon was then pulled superiorly, and the ligament of Treitz was
opened, as was the retroperitoneum over the aorta. The aortic
graft was easily identified. Some dissection planes
were made medially and lateral to the graft, and it was clamped
with a vascular clamp with no heparin on board. We then looked
distally. There was massive hemorrhage throughout the entire
case. An inflammatory mass that appeared to be
between the distal ileum and the distal end of the aortic graft
was found. This was sharply taken down, and we entered the
bowel, and [**Last Name (STitle) 19912**] arterial bleeding ensued. The bowel was
completely detached from the area, and it became apparent that
the distal anastomosis of the previously placed aortic graft had
dehisced anteriorly. Manual control was used with a finger to
control the hemorrhage.

Attention was turned distally. The right iliac artery could be
palpated, and this was dissected free in the right
retroperitoneum, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Softjaw clamp was placed on the
right iliac artery.

Attention was then rereturned to the abdominal area. The aortic
wall over the graft was opened just proximal to the hole. The
graft was dissected free, and the clamp that was above in an
uncertain location was placed directly on theDacron graft with
excellent proximal control. We thencompletely opened up the hole
in the graft and saw the leftiliac orifice which was bleeding
profusely. A 7 Fogartyembolectomy clamp was placed down the left
common iliacartery. This was connected to a 3-way stopcock to
allow it tomaintain inflation, and hemostasis in the left iliac
wascontrolled in this way. With reasonably good proximal
anddistal control, we then completely detached the graft fromthe
aortic bifurcation. There was some calcification present.There
was not any evidence of significant infection
noted.Approximately 2 inches of the aortic graft were completely
removed. A segment was sent for culture. The graft was
completely debrided free from the aortic wall distally.

We then took an 18 mm collagen-impregnated Dacron graft. An
end-to-end anastomosis was then fashioned between this graft and
the aortic bifurcation using the graft inclusion technique and
3-0 Prolene sutures. When this anastomosis was completed, clamps
were removed from the iliac as well as the balloon catheter on
the left. No backbleeding was noted. For this reason, a 5
[**Doctor Last Name **] embolectomy catheter was passed
through this short graft into the left and right iliacs and
withdrawn. A small amount of thrombus was retrieved, and there
was relatively [**Name2 (NI) 19912**] backbleeding noted through the new graft
which was then flushed with heparin, saline solution
and clamped.

We then trimmed the graft to an appropriate length to allow an
end-to-end graft-to-graft anastomosis between the old aortic
graft and the new one with a running continuous suture of 3-0
Prolene. This anastomosis was accomplished relatively
easily. The aortic graft was flushed prior to completing this
anastomosis. Flow was then reestablished into the extremities by
compressing the femoral arteries in the groin. The patient was
actually hypertensive at this point due to resuscitation
and vasopressors, and we rapidly restored flow into the pelvis,
and shortly thereafter into the lower extremities with no
obvious hemodynamic instability at this point. Femoral pulses
were noted bilaterally.

There was still significant bleeding coming from the left upper
quadrant, and it was apparent that there was bleeding from an
injury to the spleen that was made during opening of the
abdomen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**], at this point, took over in the operation
and performed a splenectomy which he will dictate separately in
his operative note.

We were
