Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CoreValve procedure
Pulmonary Intubation


History of Present Illness:
88 yo male with known aortic stenosis and history of CABG x 4
([**2175**]) who reports worsening shortness of
breath with exertion.  He is able to walk less than a block
without DOE. On [**9-19**] he experienced an episode of dyspnea, chest
pain, and witnessed collapse with no LOC. He was taken to an OSH
for r/o NSTEMI. Workup included cardiac cath revealing patent
grafts, and an echo revealing severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7cm2, mean
gradient 53, EF 45%).  He evaluated by cardiac surgery and is
deemed to be of high but not prohibitive risk with an STS risk
score of 6.5% for standard surgical aortic valve placement.  He
completed informed consent for Corevalve study protocol in the
high-risk arm, and has been randomized for Corevalve TAVI.
Prior to elective procedure, he had a mechanical fall and
sufferred rib injury and lip laceration. Antibiotic course
initiated and completed by OSH.
.
The procedure was completed on the day of arrival to the CCU.
In the OR, TEE revealed increased MR with increasing PA
pressures and EKG changes.  This was thought to be secondary to
catheter placement changes.  The catheter was repositioned and
PA pressures returned to 50/20 by the end of the procedure.
During the procedure, he was given 2L of IVF with 200cc of UOP
and 200cc of blood loss.  He was given cefazolin 2grams at 8:45
AM and Metoprolol 1mg IV.  His PA catheter was replaced with a
transvenous pacer.  At the end of the case, he needed propofol
and phenylephrine, but did not need this upon arrival to the
ICU.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, he was initially hypertensive at
164/80.  Nitro was hung as a precaution.  ABG and labs sent.
Access includes a right 5F IJ CVL, right aline, two 16G PIV's,
and left 9F venous MAC introducer.  He was complaining of chest
pain per nursing report and EKG was obtained.  The patient was
able to open his eyes.

ECHO [**11-10**]
Pre valve implant:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion. Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 914**] were
notified in person of the results on [**2195-11-10**] at 845 am.

Post valve implant:
Corevalve seen in the aortic position. It appears well seated.
There is a mild eccentric perivalvular leak present. The peak
gradient across the valve is 12 mm Hg and mean gradient is 7 mm
Hg. Mild mitral regurgitation persists. Overall LVEF unchanged.
RV function is normal.

ECHO [**11-11**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with distal septal hypokinesis. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation (paravalvar) is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-11-10**],
no change.
