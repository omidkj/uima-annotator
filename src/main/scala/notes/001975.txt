Brief Hospital Course:
Was transferred from OSH and was admitted to the ICU where she
then had an EVD placed due to hydrocephalus. She was also found
to have a small troponin leak which peaked at .37.
Hemodynamically stable. On [**3-12**] she was then intubated for a
cerebral angiogram which did not show an aneurysm. She remained
intubated due to concern for aspiration because a carrot was
seen in ETT after intubation. Later in the evening she
self-extubated and she was stable on face tent. On admission she
was found to have bilateral 6th nerve palsies which opthalmology
recommended f/u in 1 month. She failed clamping trials of her
EVD, and was taken to the OR for a VP shunt placement on [**3-23**].
Postoperatively she was transferred to the floor. She continues
to have diarrhea and is C.diff negative x 2. On [**3-28**] she was
stable for d/c to rehab. She will f/u with opthalmology in 1
month and continue on her nimodipine for 21 days. She will f/u
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 1 month with an MRI/MRA.
