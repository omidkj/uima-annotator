Brief Hospital Course:
50yo M transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] as a trauma basic.  Evaluation in the
trauma bay revealed a GCS of 15, HD stable, mildly labored
breathing but maintaining saturation on supplemental oxygen.
Imaging from OSH as well as here included CT Head (negative), CT
C-Spine (no acute injury), and CT Torso (rib fx R [**2-23**] and rib
fx L 1,[**2-20**]; R scapular fracture; possible R adrenal hemorrhage;
and transverse process fx T9, L1 and L3).

The patient was admitted to the TSICU under the Trauma Surgery
service.  Neurosurgical consult indicated no operative
management for the transverse process fractures.  Respiratory
status declined over the first hospital day leading to
endotracheal intubation on HD 2.  This remained his major issue
as ventilator status failed to improve.  He developed a MSSA PNA
(dx'd by BAL on HD 4), which was treated with a 7-day course of
Nafcillin.  His failure to wean led to an open tracheotomy
performed on HD 11, with placement of a #8 Portex.  The trach
tube caused local irritation, presumably due to being too short
in relation to his body habitus, and was therefore changed at
the bedside on HD 16 to a #8 [**Last Name (un) 295**].  The vent wean continued
but a few days later regressed.  CXRs showed a R pleural
effusion, which was drained by an IR-placed pigtail cathether
(1500cc of serosanguinous fluid on the first day) on HD 20.

Sedation during endotracheal intubation was weaned off shortly
after tracheotomy.  Analgesia and anxiolytics are currently
morphine and ativan.  Patient is interactive and appropriate
with episodes of mild agitation.  There were no cardiovascular
issues throughout his stay; antihypertensives were eventually
begun when he became hypertensive.  Tube feeds were begun
shortly after intubation via a nasogastric tube.  PEG was not an
option given his body habitus, and thus a Dobhoff was placed at
the bedside.  Renal function was stable.  Gentle diuresis with a
lasix drip was employed to facilitate the ventilator wean.
Hyperkalemia at the time of admission was treated successfully
with calcium, insulin, and bicarbonate; no further electrolyte
abnormalities ensued.  Glycemic control became problem[**Name (NI) 115**] after
reaching goal tube feeding; the patient's home doses of oral
antiglycemics were added to a progressively more-agressive
insulin sliding scale.  Besides the MSSA PNA, the patient's
sputum also grew out Enterobacter on HD 12.  Because the patient
had no fever, no leukocytosis, and no sputum, and because the
colony counts were <100,000, no antibiotics were given.  No
hematologic concerns arose; no transfusions were needed
throughout.  Prophylaxis included Heparin SQ and pneumoboots, as
well as pepcid until tube feeds reached goal.  Access included
an arterial line and central venous catheter placed on HD 1.
The right subclavian was changed on HD 11.

At the time of discharge, patient is awake and alert, tolerating
a tube feed diet via Dobhoff, on oral medications, ventilated
via trach, afebrile, with stable vital signs.
