Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty
Placement of a bare metal stent in the saphenous vein graft

History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 yo male with a history of CAD (s/p CABG), chronic
Afib, CHF, critical AS who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation for aortic valvular repair. In early [**Month (only) 404**], he was
at [**Hospital6 **] for an acute CHF exacerbation, where
he ruled in for an MI by enzymes. At [**Hospital1 **] on [**2144-12-28**], he
underwent catheterization which showed 85% stenosis of his
SVG-OM1, but a patent LIMA-LAD.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
for aortic valve replacement.
.
In preparation for surgery, he was being followed by nephrology
for chronic kidney disease.  It was felt that the patient had a
20% chance of needing dialysis following CABG.  He was also
being followed by Heme-onc for chronically elevated INR, which
was felt to be secondary to chronic warfarin use.
.
On the morning of admission, he became tachypneic, the rate of
his AFib increased and he developed substernal chest pain. His
O2 requirement increased to 92% on 2L (98% RA yesterday). Over
the past few days, he has been on a decreased dose of lasix,
only receiving 40 PO daily when his home regimen was 40mg po
BID.
.
On transfer to the CCU he converted to sinus rhythm after
receiving lasix, metazolone, and metoprolol 7.5 mg IV.  He
reported improved SOB and CP after converting.

Brief Hospital Course:
AORTIC STENOSIS
On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 94178**] EF was ~35-40% with moderate mitral
regurgitation and critical aortic stenosis (valve area of 0.6
and mean gradient of 58).  Surgical aortic valve replacement was
deferred on this admission because of the patient's worsening
renal function and multiple comorbidities, placing him at high
risk for complications with an open heart surgery.   A
percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty was performed on [**2145-1-15**]
without complication.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
He has known chronic atrial fibrillation, with a baseline LBBB.
Upon arrival to the CCU, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to be in AFib with
a rapid ventricular rate, which induced hypoxia and chest pain.
After intravenous furosemide and metoprolol, the patient quickly
returned to his baseline rhythm of atrial fibrillation with a
rate in the 70's, and his shortness of breath and chest pain
improved.  A chest X ray showed pulmonary edema, which slowly
improved over the hospital course with continued diruesis.  He
was kept on heparin throught the admission for anticoagulation
and was bridged to Coumadin at the end of his hospital stay.

CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a CABG in [**2127**] with SVG to the OM1 and LIMA to
the LAD. His cath on [**2145-1-15**] showed patent LAD and 85% stenosis
of the SVG; thus, a bare metal stent was placed in the SVG to
OM1.  He was continued on aspirin and plavix for anti-platelet
therapy.

HYPERTENSION
He was continued on metoprolol succinate and amlodipine with
good control of his blood pressure.  His home ACE inhibitor was
held in the setting of ARF.

ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE
Although his baseline Cr is unknown, his Cr was 3.2 on
admission, elevated from the 2.2 - 2.4 that he was running at
the outside hospital prior to transfer.  The aucte on CKD was
likely secondary to contrast nephropathy and a pre-renal state.
The renal service was consulted and felt there was no indication
for acute dialysis.  His kidney function improved somewhat by
the time of discharge with management of his CHF and volume
status (see above).  His home ACE inhibitor was held in the
setting of ARF.

URINARY TRACT INFECTION
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have Klebsiella in is urine cultures
from [**2143-12-31**], which was treated with cirpofloxacin.  Repeat urine
culture on [**2145-1-13**] grew Klebsiella and Enterococcus; he was
again treated with ciprofloxacin (shown to be sensitive on
culture).  The foley catheter was pulled on [**1-20**] prior to
discharge.
