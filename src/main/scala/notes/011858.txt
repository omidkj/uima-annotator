History of Present Illness:
This 58 year old male with a history of hypertension, type II
diabetes and known coronary disease presents from another
institution with worsening dyspnea for 6 weeks.  He was admitted
to [**Hospital3 **] on [**10-7**] with these symptoms and found to

x-ray and BNP 507 and was diuresed with IV lasix.

Physical Exam:
Discharge:
97.9  150/96  74  95% RA  107.1 KG
General: pleasant, answers questions appropriately
Lungs: CTAB
Cor: Nl s1s2. Sternum stable
Abdomen: soft, nontender. Normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities: warm. Trace bilateral edema. 2+ distal pulses

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath:
[**10-7**] - 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system revealed
three vessel disease. The LMCA was widely patent. The LAD had a
70%
stenosis in the mid-vessel involving the bifurcation of D1. The
LCx had
a 70% mid-vessel stenosis, subtotal occlusion of a small OM1
branch, and
95% stenosis of a large OM2 branch.  The RCA had patent stents
proximally; there was a 95% complex proximal PDA lesion, 95% RPL
lesion,
and 90% mid PDA lesion with distal vessel filling from
left-right
collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right heart
filling
pressures with a mean RA of 7mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary
hypertension with a PASP of 40mmHg.  The mean PCWP was initially
only
mildly elevated at 15mmHg but increased to 25mmHg by the end of
the
case. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.3l/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated 1+ mitral regurgitation.
The
estimated LVEF was 25% with global hypokinesis.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic and moderate diastolic ventricular
dysfunction.

TTE:
[**10-8**] - The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is top normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning and akinesis
of the mid to distal inferior and inferolateral segments and
hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral segments and
of the lateral wall. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent
with ischemic heart disease. Diastolic dysfunction with raised
filling pressures. Mild aortic regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiac catheterization revealed triple vessel disease with
normal right heart pressures.  A transesophageal echo
demonstrated left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection
fraction of 25%.  Diuresis was continued.  He was referred for
surgical intervention.

On [**10-13**] he went to the operating room where quadruple
bypass grafting was performed.  See operative note for details.
Postoperatively he did well, weaned from the ventilator easily
and remained stable. He was severely hyperglycemic, requiring an
extra day in the ICU for glucose management. Oral agents were
resumed and sliding scale regular insulin with glargine insulin
were given to facilitate weaning from the insulin infusion.

He was transferred to the floor on POD2 in stable condition.
Diuretics were continued and beta blockade was resumed.
Vancomycin was administered perioperatively as he had been
hospitalized for a week prior to surgery. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted
for elevated blood sugars. He was continued on his PO meds and
Lantus was added with improvement in his blood sugars.  On POD 4
he was noted to have a possible cellulitis at the site of
infiltrated amiodarone. He was placed on Keflex 500mg QID x5
days and warm compresses. He was cleared by PT and was
discharged to home on POD 5.
