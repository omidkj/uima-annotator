Admission Date:  [**2136-10-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-10-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2071-5-21**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CA/TH [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 -year-old gentleman
with a progressive dyspnea on exertion and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea over the past two months.  He had a
positive exercise tolerance test with some atrial and
ventricular arrhythmias noted and underwent cardiac
catheterization in [**2136-8-20**] which revealed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 18%, three vessel coronary
artery disease, and severe global hypokinesis and he was
referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery Service for coronary
artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.
3.  Recent congestive heart failure.
4.  Status post bilateral cataract extraction.
5.  Status post hand surgery many years ago.
6.  Status post ankle injury.
7.  Transient vertigo attributed to an inner ear infection
many years ago.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  Univasc 15 mg po q day, Lasix 20
mg po q day, aspirin 325 mg po q day, Glyburide 10 mg po bid,
Glucophage 1,000 mg po bid, Lipitor 10 mg po q day, and
Viagra 100 mg prn.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission to
the hospital was unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
on [**2136-10-8**], with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where he
underwent coronary artery bypass graft times four with a left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery, saphenous
vein graft to the posterior descending artery, and saphenous
vein graft to the diagonal.  Postoperatively the patient was
transported from the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit on IV drips of propofol, milrinone, and
lidocaine.  He was in normal sinus rhythm at that time.

The patient was placed on lidocaine for frequent ventricular
arrhythmias.  The milrinone was weaned off by the following
morning and late in the day on postoperative day one the
lidocaine was discontinued, as was the IV Neo-Synephrine
which had been started for some transient postoperative
hypotension.  The patient was transferred to the Telemetry
Floor on postoperative day one.

An Electrophysiology consultation was obtained due to
frequent ventricular arrhythmias in the light of a low
ejection fraction.  It was their recommendation to begin a
beta blocker when the patient was hemodynamically stable and
to study him.  Over the next few days on the Telemetry Floor,
the patient remained hemodynamically stable, continued to
have frequent premature ventricular contractions, was
progressing with cardiac rehabilitation, had been started on
low dose beta blocker and begun on diuretics.  His chest
tubes had been discontinued.

The patient was taken to the Electrophysiology Lab on
[**10-12**], where he underwent placement of a dual chamber
implantable cardioverter defibrillator.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and has remained on the
Cardiothoracic / Telemetry Floor since the placement of the
device.  He has remained hemodynamically stable and he is
ready to be discharged home today, on [**2136-10-15**],
postoperative day seven.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6 F, pulse 75
and normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure 110/80.  His weight
today is 106.2 kg, 1.0 kg above his preoperative weight of
107.2 kg.  His room air oxygen saturation is 98%.
Neurologically the patient is intact.  Pulmonary examination
is unremarkable.  His lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His coronary examination is regular rate and
rhythm.  His sternum is stable.  His incision is clean, dry,
and intact and his right leg incision is also clean, dry, and
intact with no erythema or drainage.

LABORATORY DATA:  His most recent chest x-ray is from
[**2136-10-13**], which revealed small bilateral pleural
effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis.  Most recent
laboratory values are from [**2136-10-15**], which revealed
a white blood cell count of 10,100, hematocrit of 24.8, a
platelet count of 379,000.  Urinalysis on [**10-14**]
revealed 0 to 2 white blood cells, and few bacteria.  Other
laboratory values from [**2136-10-14**], are a sodium of
138, potassium 4.9, chloride 105, CO2 27, BUN 24, creatinine
1.2, glucose 110.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 20 mg po bid times one week,
potassium chloride 20 mEq po bid times one week, Colace 100
mg po bid, enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q day, Glucophage
1,000 mg po bid, Glyburide 10 mg po bid, Captopril 12.5 mg po
q eight hours, Lipitor 10 mg po q HS, Lopressor 12.5 mg po
bid, amiodarone 200 mg po tid times one week, then amiodarone
400 mg po q day times one month, then amiodarone 200 mg po q
day, ibuprofen 400 mg po q six hours prn, Percocet 5/325 one
tablet po q four hours prn pain, and ciprofloxacin 500 mg one
tablet po bid times five days for the urinary tract
infection.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up in the Device Clinic
here at [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**], seventh floor, Cardiology Department, on [**2136-10-19**], at 11 o'clock in the morning.  The telephone number
there is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21817**].  He is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] next week.  His office has been contact[**Name (NI) **].  And he is to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one month for
postoperative wound check.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft.
2.  Severe left ventricular dysfunction.
3.  Frequent ventricular arrhythmias, status post automatic
implantable cardioverter - defibrillator placement.
