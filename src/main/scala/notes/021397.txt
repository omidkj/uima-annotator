Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath [**2136-11-15**]: 1.  Selective coronary angiography in
this right dominant system demonstrated severe native three
vessel disease.  The LMCA was non-obstructed.  The LAD had
severe mid-vessel disease up to 90% at D1. The D1 had an ostial
90% stenosis.  The LCx had severe diffuse disease. The RI had a
90% ostial stenosis in a long vessel.  The RCA was flush
occluded at the ostium and fills by left to right collaterals.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic
arterial blood pressure with a central aortic pressure of 125/52
mmHg.
.
TTE [**2136-11-20**]: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akiesis of all distal segments and apex as well
as severe hypokinesis of the mid portions of all inferior and
lateral segments. The overall ejection fraction is in the 25%
range. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis and severe focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The left coronary cusp appears to be
immobilized. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure
half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation
of true mitral valve area. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results in the operating room at the time of the study.
POST-BYPASS The patient is receiving epinephrine,
norepinephrine, and milrinone by infusion. The patient is AV
paced. Right ventricular systolic function is improved but
distal free wall hypokinesis remains. The left ventricle
displays improved function of the moderate global hypokinesis
but the focal abnormalities noted in the pre-bypass persist. The
overall ejection fraction is in the range of 30%. There is a
mitral valve annuloplasty ring in situ. It appears well seated.
There is trace mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
stenosis. The thoracic aorta is intact after decannulation.
.
Carotid U/S [**2136-11-16**]: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40%
stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88012**] is an 85 year old male s/p NSTEMI transferred for
cardiac catheterization. On [**2136-11-16**] he underwent cardiac cath
which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease. Echo
done on [**11-16**] revealed moderate mitral regurgitation. He was,
therefore, referred for cardiac surgery. He received medical
management over the next several days and clearance from
oncology/hematology for his prostate cancer and nephrology for
dialysis.

On [**11-20**] he was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass graft x 5 and mitral valve repair. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. He weaned off Levophed, Milrinone and Epinephrine on
POD 1 and remained hemodynamically stable with an adequate
cardiac output. His permanent pacemaker was interrogated on POD
1 and found to be functioning normally. His temporary pacing
wires were then removed.  CTs remained in place for several days
due to the serous output, but were removed without incident on
POD 5.

 He remained on Vasopressin for hypotension for several days
post op and was eventually weaned off completely on POD 6. On
POD 6 he was transferred to the floor in stable condition. He
was followed by the nephrology service and dialyzed for several
successive days postoperatively  and then on his regular
schedule via his left AV fistula.  He had poor oral intake and
supplements were started as well as calorie counts.low dose beta
blocker was subsequently added.

He developed abdominal cramping and loose stool which resolved.
He remained afebrile with normal white blood cell count and
CDiff toxin was negative. He was evaluated by Physical Therapy
for strength and mobility.  He was transferred to  [**Hospital 38**]
Rehab on [**2136-12-3**] in stable condition.  All follow up
appointments were arranged.
