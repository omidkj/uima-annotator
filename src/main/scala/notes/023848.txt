Chief Complaint:
L3 osteo and question abscess

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Multiple thoracic laminectomies, extending from T4-T12
    and total laminectomies from L1-L5 with evacuation of
    epidural abscess as well as intradural abscess.

History of Present Illness:
55 y/o female with PMH significant for lung cancer in [**2109**], HTN,
and [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for further treatment
of L3 osteo and question of an abcess at that level. Pt was in
her normal state of health until early [**11/2111**] when she
developed low back pain while bending over. She was evaluated by
her PCP for this on [**11-26**] and prescribed percocet and flexeril.
Her pain did not resolve and she presented to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ED
for further evaluation on [**11-30**]. She described the pain as a
constant stabbing pain associated weakness. The pain was
increased with ambulation. At that time, the pt denied loss of
bowel or bladder control. Spinal films were significant for
anterolisthesis of L3-4 and L4-5. No fracture or destructive
lesion was noted. Pt's SBP was decreased in the 70s but
responded to a fluid bolus. Per notes from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital,
she was going to be admitted and receive a MRI but decided to go
home. Pt then called EMS from home on [**12-2**] to be trasported to
[**Hospital1 1474**] secondary to her ongoing low back pain. Her husband
reports that she was unable to ambulate at that time due to
bilateral LE weakness. Per EMS notes, her VS were HR 138, BP
86/P, and a RR of 20. Per notes, pt had noted recent fevers at
home up to 101. Her family reports that these had started
occuring when she developed the back pain. In the [**Hospital1 1474**] ED,
she received toradol and dilaudid with a decrease in her SBP
into the 70s. She also received Tequin and Flayl. A CT of the
abdomen and pelvis was obtained that showed marked distention of
the gallbladder.
.
Pt was initially admitted to the MICU at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.
There, she received IV fluids and was started on a dilaudid PCA
for pain control. Pt was then transferred to the floor on the
day of admission. On the floor, she developed respiratory
distress and became obtunded. She was noted to have crackles on
exam and was given lasix 60 mg IV x1 with some improvement of
her respiratory status. However, approximately five hours later,
she once again developed increased respiratory effort. CXR was
consistent with pulmonary edema. Pt was given another 60 mg of
IV lasix and put out 300 cc of urine in the next 1.5 hours. Her
BP was 100/60 and she remained obtunded. Pt was given another 80
mg of IV lasix and transferred back to the MICU for further
care. In the MICU, the pt was placed on BiPAP 10/5. Her oxygen
sats were 94 to 100%. She was noted to be in new atrial
tachycardia with a HR ranging from 140 to 170 so was gien
Dilaudid 2 gm IV x1. Pt's SBP then decreased to the 70s. A right
femoral A line and central line were placed. The pt was
cardioverted with return to sinus rhythem. An echo was done
which was significant for a LVEF of 65 to 70%, diminished RV
function, and mild TR. There was a concern at that time that the
pt had sufferred a PE. It was felt that she was not stable
enought to receive a VQ scan or CTA so she was emperically
started on a heparin drip.
.
During her time in the [**Hospital1 1474**] MICU, the pt's blood cultures
returned growing gram positive cocci. These were obtained prior
to placement of her central line. The pt was started on
vamcomycin and zosyn. Her creatinine increased to a high of 2.4
and has now trended down to 1.8. A CT scan of the lumbosacral
spine was obtained that was concerning for osteomyelitis of L3.
There was also concern for an abcess in this area. She could not
receive a MRI at [**Hospital1 1474**] as she was intubated. Therefore, the
pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.


Past Medical History:
1. Small cell lung carcinoma on the right- Pt was diagnosed in
[**2109**]. She was treated with chemotherapy and radiation. She did
not have any surgery. Per her family, it was not known to be
metastatic and she has been in remission for over on year.
Oncologist is Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 21628**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]
2. [**Name (NI) **] Pt had a non ST MI in [**2110**] in the setting of a COPD
exacerbation. Pt had a stress test in [**2110**] which was signifcant
for a LVEF of 38% and a moderate sized fixed inferior lateral
defect.
3. Hypertension
4. GERD
5. S/P excision of lipoma
6. S/P eye surgery
7. S/P knee surgery
8. S/P tonsillectomy

Pertinent Results:
Culture date from [**Hospital1 1474**]: micro lab [**Telephone/Fax (1) 65800**]
Urine culture ([**12-5**])- FINAL- No growth
Sputum culture ([**12-5**])- Many staph aureus.
Blood culture- [**2-25**] MRSA
- [**2-25**] GPC.
.
CT abdomen and pelvis ([**12-3**]-[**Hospital1 1474**])- Moderate to marked
gallbladder distention without surrounding inflammatory change.
No definite ureteral catheters or obstructive
hydroureteronephrosis. Aortic calcification without evidence of
aneurysm or leak. No definite intra abdominal or pelvic
inflammatory process. Patchy left lower lung interstitial
opacity. Slight nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland.
Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
.
CT lumbar spine ([**12-5**]-[**Hospital1 1474**])- Moderate erosion of the face
joints bilaterally at L3-4 and L4-5. Vacuum phenomenon is noted
in the right L4-5 facet joint raising the question of septic
arthritis. Mild nonspecific edema of the subcutaneous tissues
posteriorly in the midline extending from L1 to at least L5 most
pronounced at L4. There is a suggestion of a 2 x 1.5 cm fluid
collection in the midline posterior to the L3 and L4 spinous
processes. The thecal sac and the epidural space cannot be
evaluated at these levels. In the thecal sac at the level of L5
and S1 there are whate appear to be vertically oriented linear
calcifications that is suspicious for arachnoiditis ossificans.
At L1-2, L2-3, and L5-S1 there is no disc herniation, central
stenosis, or foraminal stenosis.
.
MR L spine ([**12-8**]) - Large multilobulated fluid collection
centered at L3-4, extending bilaterally into the perivertebral
soft tissues and posteriorly into the midline subcutaneous
tissues. In addition, there is a large epidural collection,
presumably abscess, which extends at least as far superiorly as
T11. The superior extent of this collection is unknown. In
addition, a right psoas/iliopsoas abscess is present. The full
extent of this abscess is also not determined.
.
MR C/T spine ([**12-8**]) - Severe arachnoid and ependymal
enhancement most compatible with an intradural inflammatory or
infectious process. No discrete epidural fluid collection is
definitely seen in the thoracic or cervical spine in this
somewhat technically limited examination.
.
TTE ([**12-7**]) - Preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow
identified. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
TEE ([**12-25**]):
1. Left ventricular wall thickness,
