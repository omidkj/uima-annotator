PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male with a history
of metastatic malignant melanoma metastatic to liver, lungs,
and brain and small bowel who was admitted with right flank
pain times two days and shortness of breath times two days.
The patient had woken up from sleep four days ago with right
flank pain which was pleuritic and radiated to the chest and
arm.  He became short of breath two days prior to admission.
The patient had two recent car trips, had no leg swelling,
and the review of systems was otherwise negative.

Patient was first diagnosed in [**2107**] with melanoma and has
been complicated by cerebral hemorrhage in [**12/2119**] with
associated seizures status post craniotomy and also by the
aforementioned metastases to liver and small bowel.  Patient
most recently has been treated on Dilantin, thalidomide,
Temozolomide.

This patient is status post numbers of years of chemotherapy
and adjuvant treatment, including Interferon, IL2, and the
most recent therapy listed above.  Patient was enrolled in
the current clinical trial in [**2120-6-30**], which has included
whole-brain radiation, Temozolomide, and thalidomide.  He
recently completed the first 10-week cycle two weeks ago, and
repeat CT scans and the brain MRI, which were done on [**9-12**], revealed significant regression in his ............
abdominal and pelvic disease, undetectable pulmonary nodules,
and regression of the lesions in his brain.

Patient had numerous risk factors for a clot, which included
his known malignancy, his treatment with thalidomide, which
can be prothrombotic, his long car rides, which were greater
than three hours times two.

In the Emergency Room the patient had a CT angiogram which
showed 1) bilateral large pulmonary emboli with clot in the
left main pulmonary artery bifurcation of the left and right
main pulmonary arteries,  2) right-sided pulmonary effusion,
and 3) collaterals of left chest wall suggesting a left
subclavian clot.

Patient was not started on anticoagulation given his past
medical history of spontaneous bleeding and his melanoma
metastases to the brain.  Patient was admitted from the
Emergency Room to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Malignancy melanoma diagnosed in [**2107**].
2.  Brain metastases status post XRT whole-brain radiation in
the spring and summer of [**2120**].
3.  Cranial bleed in 12/[**2119**].
4.  Seizure in 12/[**2119**].
5.  Stereotactic radiosurgery to the frontal lobe.
6.  Lung and small bowel metastases.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Reglan.
2.  Iodine although he can take contrast.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a former urologist and his
oncologist fellow is [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41157**].

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Dilantin 300 b.i.d.
2.  Chemotherapy with Temozolomide and thalidomide, as
mentioned before.

EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  94% Oxygen saturation on
two liters nasal cannula.  Blood pressure was 140/76.  Heart
rate 65.  In general this was a middle-aged man lying flat
post procedure.  Pain with movements.  HEENT showed alopecia,
plethora of the head and face.  Oropharynx:  Clear, PERRL and
bilateral nystagmus.  Jugular venous distention lying flat 4
cm from clavicular line.  No carotid bruits.  Lungs:
Right-sided one-third up reduced breath sounds, rales at the
edge of the base, reduced breath sounds bilaterally, reduced
fremita.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, S1, S2, elevated T2,
no murmurs, gallops, rubs.  Abdomen:  Nontender, soft,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis,
edema, [**3-3**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.  Neuro:
Alert and oriented, pleasant.

There are no significant laboratory abnormalities on
admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted from the Emergency
Room where he had a CT angiogram showing 1) bilateral large
pulmonary embolus with the largest embolus seen in the left
main pulmonary artery; saddle embolus is present, 2)
right-sided pleural effusion, 3) collateral vessels seen
within the left chest wall suggesting occlusion of the left
subclavian.  Patient also went directly to Interventional
Radiology as he was not a candidate for coagulation for
aforementioned spontaneous intracranial bleed.  In [**2119-12-31**] patient had IVC filter placed as well as an
echocardiogram to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of the
pulmonary embolism and to guide IV fluid therapy.  Patient
had successful placement of Gunther-Tulip vena cava filter
just below the level of the renal vein from the common
femoral approach.

Patient also had bilateral lower extremity Dopplers performed
on [**2120-9-24**].  The results were 1) nonocclusive thrombus at
the right common femoral vein which has extensions to the
greater saphenous vein and the deep femoral vein, 2) no
evidence of left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.

Patient also had echocardiogram on [**2120-9-23**].  The
conclusions were left atrium normal in size.  Left
ventricular wall thickness is normal.  Left ventricular
cavity size is normal.  Overall ventricular systolic size is
normal with left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 to 70%.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.  The
aortic root is moderately dilated.  The mitral valve appears
structurally normal, a trivial mitral regurgitation.  The
tricuspid leaflets are mildly thickened.  Moderate 2+ TR
regurgitation is seen.  There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.  There is no pericardial effusion
compared with the findings of prior report of [**2120-4-19**],
left ventricular enlargement is no longer apparent.

Given this result, deemed that right ventricular failure was
not present, patient was transferred from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the
floor on [**2120-9-24**] in good condition.  Patient was satting
approximately 95 to 96% on transfer on room air but was
continuously short on breath with any walking or activity
such as brushing teeth.

Again, the issue of anticoagulation was addressed on
[**2120-9-25**] with differing specialists suggesting alternative
approaches.  To better assess the patient's risk, a head CT
without contrast was performed.  The results of the CT were
no acute hemorrhage or mass effect, stable appearance of the
right frontal lobe resection bed, and left cerebral
hemorrhage likely due to punctate left cerebellar tonsillar
metastases.

The finding of small focus of hyperdensity within the left
cerebellum was consistent with the finding of susceptibility
within the same region on a prior MRI and likely represented
an area of old hemorrhage into a metastatic lesion.  This
result like the issue of anticoagulation remaining complex.
There was the issue of recent hemorrhage into the cerebellar
metastases.  In addition, patient had large pulmonary
embolus.  Patient was loathed to begin anticoagulation and
wanted to wait and see if he had more sequelae from clotting
before addressing anticoagulation, especially given that he
had a filter placed to prevent further pulmonary embolus from
the lower extremities.

The issue of propagation of the existing clot was discussed
at length with Oncology as well as the Pulmonary team.
Pulmonology does not recommend anticoagulation with the idea
that Heparin would not significantly affect propagation of
the existing clot and the clot would eventually be reabsorbed
and the patient would still have significant risk of bleeding
into his metastatic lesion.

On [**2120-9-27**] the patient had sudden onset chest pain with
pleuritic component.  His blood pressure was unchanged.  His
heart rate was stable.  Patient was not short of breath, and
his oxygen saturation remained at 96% on room air.  Patient
was much worse with inspiration.  EKG showed no S-T
depressions, no T-wave inversions, no new Q-waves and was
relatively unchanged from his admission EKG.  A stat portable
chest x-ray was performed on [**2120-9-27**] showing 1) improving
right lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation, 2) patchy
opacity of the left lateral lung field corresponding
