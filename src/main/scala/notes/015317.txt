Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient transferred from [**Hospital3 3834**]
Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for pericardial effusion,
hypotension, pending tamponade.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 69-year-old female
with diabetes diet controlled, atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin with unknown CAD presents to [**Hospital3 3834**] after
one week of progressive dyspnea on exertion.  Per patient's
symptoms started approximately two months ago with
progressive shortness of breath and inability to exercise as
she previously tolerated.  Of note, the patient recently had
DDD [**Company 1543**] pacemaker placed on [**2146-11-4**] for sick sinus
syndrome and A-V block.

At [**Hospital3 3834**], the patient was found to be
hypotensive, anemic with a hematocrit of 24, and in acute
renal failure with a creatinine of 4.1, coagulopathic, INR
4.5.  Patient treated with subQ vitamin K 2.5 mg, 3 units of
FFP, transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.  Course
was complicated by hypotension with systolic blood pressure
in the 70s, given 200 cc/hour IV fluids, and dobutamine 2
mg/kg/minute.  No tachycardia, adequately paced.
Echocardiogram obtained showed a 1-3 cm circumferential
pericardial effusion with early tamponade, question for left
atrial collapse, no pulsus paradoxus noted.

Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.  Patient is hypotensive on
admission.  Systolic blood pressure in the 70s with
lightheadedness, neck and jaw pain.  Dobutamine stopped and
bolused 500 cc of normal saline x2.  Refractory hypertension,
peripheral dopamine started at 5 and increased to 8 mcg.
Bedside echocardiogram demonstrated diastolic RV collapse
with INR of 4.7, 4 units of FFP infused, as well as 5 mg of
IV vitamin K.  An atrial line was placed which demonstrated
inspiratory variation.  Patient on call to the Catheter
Laboratory for assessment for presumed cardiac tamponade.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes adult onset.
2. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
3. Pacemaker placed on [**2146-11-4**].
4. Complete heart block with sick sinus syndrome.
5. Hypercholesterolemia.
6. Renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine of 1.5-2.

ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative tobacco, IV drug use, alcohol.  The
patient lives alone.  Has a daughter and son, who are
involved.

VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile, 97.6, blood pressure
82/60, dopamine 5 mcg, rate 63, ventricular paced,
respirations 18, and 93% on 4 liters nasal cannula.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Mild respiratory distress,
unable to speak in full sentences.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  EOMI.
Oropharynx clear, nonicteric.  Elevated jugular venous
pressure to TMJ, no thyromegaly.  Cardiovascular:  Distant
heart sounds, murmurs, rubs, or gallops not appreciated.
Pulmonary:  Anterolateral clear to auscultation with
decreased breath sounds at left base.  Abdomen is mildly
distended, obese nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly, no
pulsatile liver.  Extremities:  2+ bilateral pitting edema to
mid calf, +2 femoral pulses, no bruits.  Dopplerable DP and
PT pulses.  Neurologic is alert and oriented times three.
Strength 5/5 throughout.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 9.2, hematocrit 30.7
status post 2 units of packed red blood cells.  Sodium 124,
potassium 5.7, chloride 93, bicarb 18, BUN 84, creatinine
4.0, glucose 132, INR of 4.5.

EKG:  Atrial fibrillation, paced, no ischemic ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation
recently placed pacemaker, subacute pericardial effusion of
unclear etiology likely hemorrhagic, workup viral, malignant
physiology.

Patient is taken to Catheterization Laboratory for
therapeutic diagnostic drainage.  Pericardial centesis
performed removal of 1,050 cc of hemorrhagic pericardial
fluid.  Echocardiogram showed minimal residual fluid.
Filling pressures remained elevated with wide respiratory
variation with RA pressure 35, PA 60/30, and PCW 35.
Improvement in cardiac output and resolution of paradoxical
pulse.  Dobutamine originally 8 mcg/kg was discontinued.
Runs of VT with good blood pressure noted during procedure
possibly related to catheterization manipulation.  Patient is
currently chest pain free and sent back to CCU for recovery.
Fluid sent for cytology and other studies.

Patient's pericardial drain remained in place, on hospital
day one drained 300 cc of bright red blood.  On hospital day
two, 215 cc of bright red blood.  Repeat echocardiogram
showed minimal change and small amount of pericardial
effusion, no tamponade physiology.  The patient continued to
be chest pain free.  INR was reversed successfully to 1.8 on
hospital day one.  Patient remained normotensive off pressors
and began diuresing.  Elevated PA diastolic pressures of 22
post procedure suggest volume overload in the setting of
aggressive fluid resuscitation during periods of
hypertension.  Patient was given 20 mg of IV Lasix q.d. plus
1.5 liter output.

Initial cytology negative.  Viral cultures pending.  Gram
stain negative.  CBC consistent with hemorrhagic fluid.  EP
evaluation was obtained to assess proper lead placement
suspicious for LV lead position on chest x-ray.  Under
fluoroscopy, pacer lead was withdrawn and replaced likely
perforating into pericardial sac.  Interrogation read no
abnormal impedance.  Appropriate sensation of pacing.
Patient remained off aspirin and anticoagulation in the
setting of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.

Drain was discontinued on hospital day #3.  Patient continued
to be chest pain free.  Was transferred to the floor, where
she underwent Physical Therapy with continual shortness of
breath.

2. Renal function:  On arrival, patient likely prerenal
secondary to poor cardiac output due to tamponade physiology.
Autodiuresis post procedure significantly improved
creatinine.  At time of discharge, patient had baseline
creatinine of 1.2.

3. ID:  Viral bacterial serologies were sent for pericardial
analysis.  Gram negative cultures negative at time of
dictation.

4. Pulmonary:  Stable PCWP 30 at time of catheterization,
likely volume overload in the setting of aggressive fluid
rehydration.  Continue with diuresis of Lasix 20 IV q.d.
Chest x-ray negative for pneumothorax post procedure.
Continued to be sating 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula, 95% on
room air at time of discharge.

5. FEN and GI:  Hyponatremia:  Patient likely sodium wasting
secondary to from ATN from hypotensive episode.  At time of
discharge, sodium normalized to 136.  Potassium repleted.
Magnesium repleted and appropriate throughout.

6. Heme:  Coagulation reversed in setting of hemorrhagic
pericardial effusion with 4 units of FFP, 5 mg IV of vitamin
K.  Hold on anticoagulation for at least one month.  No
aspirin for at least one month.

Patient is discharged to followup with Cardiology Device
Clinic in one week.  Will need to followup with cardiologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] within two weeks.  Patient desires continual care
at [**Hospital1 69**].  Patient given
number for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for possible future followup.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  To be addended at a later date.
