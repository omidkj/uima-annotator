HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 59 year old
male with a past medical history of recent Streptococcal
bacteremia currently on Penicillin G, atrial valve
replacement secondary to bicuspid valve and aortic stenosis.
The patient was recently admitted on [**2190-2-2**] with fever
and back pain and was found to have at that time a hemolytic
Streptococcus bacteremia.  Initially, the patient was treated
with Vancomycin but changed to penicillin G once the
sensitivities were done.

A transesophageal echocardiogram then was performed which was
negative for endocarditis.  A MRA prior to discharge showed
increased ........  of single and rector spinal muscles at
T3-4 adjacent to facets and anterior within the right psoas.
There was no discitis or abscess.  Thallium scan on
[**2190-2-11**] corroborated the MRA findings.  The patient was
discharged home on [**2190-2-9**].

Since discharge, his pain has persisted and waxed and waned.
He had one temperature of 100.0 F., accompanied by mild
chills, but no higher temperatures or sweats.

The patient denies nausea or vomiting; no urinary symptoms.
MRI done yesterday for re-evaluation since his pain was so
severe, revealed an L2-3 discitis and osteomyelitis with
extension into the psoas anteriorly as well as the rector
spinal muscles posteriorly on the right.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Streptococcus bacteremia.
2.  Diabetes mellitus type 2 times 20 years.
3.  Aortic valve replacement; bicuspid valve and aortic
stenosis on [**2187-1-15**].
4.  Hypertension.
5.  High cholesterol.
6.  Hemorrhoids.
7.  Right knee surgery but without any hardware.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Penicillin G 4 million units q. four hours.
2.  Avapro 75 mg q. day.
3.  Lantus 22 units q. a.m.
4.  Zestoretic 5/12.5.
5.  Celexa 20 mg q. day.
6.  Percocet q. four hours p.r.n.
7.  Atenolol 25 mg three times a day.
8.  Humalog sliding scale.
9.  Aspirin 325 mg q. day.
10. Lipitor 20 mg q. day.
11. Colace 100 mg twice a day.
12. Valium 10 mg.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   No tobacco, no ethanol.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Father died of a heart attack at 76 years
old and had prostate cancer.  Mother died of lung cancer in
her 70s.  There is a positive family history of diabetes
mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 97.6 F.; heart rate 62;
blood pressure 164/79; 98% on room air.  In general, the
patient is not in acute distress, alert and oriented times
three.  HEENT:  Moist oral mucosa.  Neck with no jugular
venous distention.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm, III/VI
systolic ejection murmur radiating to the carotid.  Lungs
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen with positive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender.  Neurological:  Deferred as
patient just had sedation prior to biopsy of his discs.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count was 6.0, hematocrit 27.2,
platelets 333.  Chem-7 was normal.

The patient was admitted on [**2190-3-6**] initially to the
Medicine Service.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Upon admission, the patient received a
disc biopsy in an attempt to identify the organisms
responsible for the osteomyelitis.  He was started on
Vancomycin and Gentamicin as treatment.

Early in the patient's stay, he was found to have increasing
anemia.  His disc cultures came out negative although a set
of blood cultures indicated Gram positive cocci bacteremia.

The Infectious Disease service was involved early on.  They
agreed with the antibiotic choice.  They also requested that
another transesophageal echocardiogram be performed to rule
out endocarditis.  On the 3rd, the patient developed atrial
fibrillation.  The Electrophysiology Team was involved, who
also recommended a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out
abscess.

The transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which was
concerning for endocarditis.  Cardiology performed a
transesophageal echocardiogram which did not show any obvious
vegetations, but there was valve dehiscence and mitral
regurgitation, which led them to believe that there probably
biosynthetic aortic valve replacement endocarditis.

The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells on
the 5th.  On [**2190-3-12**], the patient was taken to the
Operating Room by the Neurosurgery Team for bilateral L2, L3
diskectomy and right L3-L4 hemilaminectomy and medial
facetectomy performed.  The specimens were sent to
Microbiology.  There was no obvious osteomyelitis per
Neurosurgery although there was muscle necrosis surrounding
the facets.  No gross pus was seen.  A drain was left in for
one to two days.

On the 8th, the Cardiothoracic Surgery Team was involved with
the intention of doing a re-do aortic valve replacement.  The
CT Surgery Team was concerned about the patient's new onset
atrial fibrillation and requested that the patient be ruled
out for myocardial infarction which was done.  Amiodarone was
started per Electrophysiology and the patient was given
increasing doses of Lopressor.  Over the course of the next
few days, the patient continued to require blood transfusions
and manipulation of his blood pressure and heart rate control
medications.

Over the next several days, the patient was continued on
antibiotics although cultures from the Operating Room samples
remained negative.  Over these days, his creatinine started
to increase which was treated with intravenous fluids and
close monitoring of the Gentamicin levels.

With the intention of taking the patient to the Operating
Room for aortic valve replacement secondary to endocarditis a
cardiac catheterization was performed to insure that there
was not a need for coronary artery bypass graft during the
same procedure.

On the 13th, the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care
Unit for biventricular systolic hypertension requiring
nitroprusside treatment.
