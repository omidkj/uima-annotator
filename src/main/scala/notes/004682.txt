ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, which gives him hives.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a remote history of a 45

The patient was originally scheduled for surgery on [**5-9**],
but when the patient was seen in the preoperative holding
area the patient was found to have a significant upper
respiratory infection.  The patient was given a one week
course of antibiotics and surgery was rescheduled for [**5-23**].

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2118-5-23**]
and taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for a
redo sternotomy and an aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm
pericardial valve.  The patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on an epinephrine
Amiodarone drip.  The patient was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventilation on postoperative day number one.  The
patient had adequate cardiac index on epinephrine.
Epinephrine was weaned to off.  The patient was started on
Lopressor for control of hypertension and tachycardia.  The
patient became agitated on the evening of postoperative day
number one and started on low dose Haldol.  Postoperative day
number two the patient began working with physical therapy.
The patient was started on Lasix postoperative day number two
with adequate diuresis.  The patient required a nitroglycerin
drip to control his blood pressure.  Postoperatively, the
patient had a continued leukocytosis of unknown origin.  The
patient was afebrile.  On postoperative day number four the
patient was able to walk 300 feet with physical therapy.
Postoperative day number four the patient was noted to have a
moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage fro the distal
portion of his sternal incision.  The patient continued to
have drainage.  It was decided that the wound would be
covered with Dermabond.  The wound was cleaned and prepped in
a sterile fashion.  Dermabond was applied to the distal
portion of the sternal incision.  However, the incision
continued to drain serosanguinous fluid and required repeat
Dermabond applications over the next several days.

The patient continued to work with physical therapy and was
able to achieve a level five.  The patient's pacing wires
were removed without difficulty.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  The patient had been on antibiotics
for prophylaxis of a sternal wound Vancomycin and
Levofloxacin.  On postoperative day number seven the
Vancomycin was stopped.  On postoperative day number seven
the patient required placement of a PICC line as the patient
had no further intravenous access.  The patient tolerated
this procedure well.  The patient continued to have drainage
from the sternal incision and had difficulty understanding
and following the repeat instructions for maintaining strict
sternal precautions and not using his arms.  However, on
postoperative day nine the patient had no drainage from his
sternum and was deemed stable for discharge to home.
