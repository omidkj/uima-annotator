CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an
88-year-old Russian woman who presented with decreased mental
status and an 02 saturation of 45% on room air at her nursing
home on the date of admission.  She was brought to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Room where her 02
saturation was brought up to 100% on 100% nonrebreather mask.
A chest x-ray at the time showed a new right lower lobe
infiltrate and effusion.  The patient was started on
intravenous Levaquin and Flagyl and brought to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for mask ventilation.  She was stable
with good 02 saturations at 12 midnight the night of
admission.  The patient's mental status cleared up as she
removed her BiPAP mask and kept her 02 saturation greater
than 94% on half liter nasal cannula.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
3.  Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
6.  History of depression.
7.  History of rapid atrial fibrillation plus cardioversion
[**2173-8-30**].
8.  History of hyponatremia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glipizide 5 mg q.d., Flovent 2
puffs b.i.d., Serevent 2 puffs b.i.d., multivitamin, Colace
100 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

PSYCHOSOCIAL HISTORY FROM [**Hospital3 **]:  Son lives in
[**State 4565**], phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35475**]; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35476**].

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Her temperature was 99.2 on
rectally.  Pulse 96.  Respirations 20.  Blood pressure
110/60, 02 saturation 92% on two liters, 49 kilograms.  On
examination, she was lying in bed asleep.  She was arousable
but difficult to keep awake.  Her heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  She had decreased breath sounds in the right lower
and mid lung field.  Her left was clear to auscultation.
There were no crackles and rare expiratory wheezes in the
right upper lung field.  She was guaiac negative per the
Medical Intensive Care Unit note from [**2173-11-19**].  She
had normal active bowel sounds.  Her abdomen was soft,
nondistended, nontender.  Her extremities:  She had
Pneumoboots on with palpable distal pulses bilaterally.  Her
calves were nontender and she had no edema.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON THE DAY OF DISCHARGE:  CBC:  White
blood cell count 8.1, hemoglobin and hematocrit of 10.1 and
32.6, platelet count of 521,000.  Chemistry panel:  Sodium
140, potassium 4.1, chloride 96, bicarbonate 44, BUN and
creatinine 21 and 0.5.  Glucose is 61.  Her calcium is 9.1,
magnesium is 1.7, her phosphorus is 3.4.  Her chest x-ray on
[**11-21**] showed an enlarged heart size, moderate right
pleural effusion and a small to moderate left pleural
effusion, as well as pulmonary vascular cephalization.  Her
arterial blood gases on [**11-21**] is as follows:  PH 7.30,
p02 of 61, pCO2 of 81 and bicarbonate of 41 (this is on two
liters).

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from the
Medical Intensive Care Unit to the regular Medicine Floor on
hospital day number two.  After her mental status cleared and
she was able to oxygenate by herself on the evening of
hospital day number two, she had an episode of desaturation
greater than 80% on room air was becoming lethargic.  She was
placed on nasal BiPAP with rapid improvement of 02 saturation
and clearing of her mental status.  Subsequently, she had two
more episodes of desaturating during her seven day hospital
stay.  During these episodes, Respiratory Therapy was called
in to administer Atrovent and albuterol nebulizer treatments
in addition her supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula was also
decreased.  These two measures would invariably clear up her
mental status rapidly.  Her chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease was addressed by having Respiratory Therapy
administering albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers every four
hours on a standing dose as opposed to as needed.  In
addition, she was given chest Physical Therapy three times a
day with suctioning of secretion.  Her 02 saturation remained
greater than 90% on minimal supplemental 02 (no more than 1.5
liters nasal cannula).  The feeling at the time of discharge
was that supplemental 02 will decrease the patient's
respiratory drive, given her long history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and the fact that she is most
likely an 02 retainer.  Concern for aspiration pneumonia was
addressed by placing patient on aspiration precautions.  In
addition, the patient was maintained on Levaquin and Flagyl.
She will finish a ten day course of these antibiotics.  The
patient remained afebrile throughout the hospitalization with
no leukocytosis.  The patient will be discharged to her
nursing home.

disease 40 mg po times two days, then 30 mg po times two,
then 20 mg po times two days, then 10 mg po times two days,
then 5 mg po times two days and then off.
4.  Atrovent, albuterol nebulizers q. 4 hours standing dose.
