Brief Hospital Course:
44 yr/o M with severe refractory asthma presenting with
significant SOB and wheezing with increased WOB in the ER
requiring continuous nebs and raising concern for possible
decompensation to intubation.

# Asthma - Severe refractory: Currently with flare that started
the morning of admission and was not able to turn around at home
by starting prednisone/Azithro. [**Month (only) 116**] have been triggered by
bronchitis with 1 week of productive cough and clear CXR. Has
multiple past admissions and intubations raising likelihood that
he may not be able to turn around with just nebs. Had elevated
Eos at times in the past as well as mildly elevated IgE levels.
Abnormal RAST testing in past. Multiple negative aspergillus Abs
in the past. PFTs in [**March 2178**] showing severe obstructive
defect.

to Q1H then to Q2H then to Q4H.  Patient was started on IV
solumedrol 60mg IV Q8hrs.  Also started azithro 250mg Q24 for
total of 5 day course.  Patient continued on home inhalers.  His
breathing improved and he was called out to medicine floor.
While on the floor, the patient was continued on his home
medications; he was also transitioned from IV solumedrol to
prednisone 60 mg daily.  He was saturating well on room air,
breathing comfortably.  A peak flow prior to discharge was 370,
which is near his baseline.  The patient was discharged on a
prednisone taper (60 mg x5 days, 50 mg x5days, 40 mg x5days),
and then was instructed to continue his home dose of 30 mg
prednisone daily.  He was also discharged on another two days of
azithromycin to complete a total five day course.
