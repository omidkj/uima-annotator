History of Present Illness:
58 yo male with chronic systolic heart failure (EF 35-47%), CAD
w/ MI s/p CABG ([**2079**] at [**Hospital 3340**] Clinic with (LIMA to LAD, SVG
to PDA,
radial to diag), HTN, DM (A1C 7.9%), a chronic nonhealing right
heel ulcer s/p popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass using reverse
saphenous venous graft ([**12/2101**]) c/b post-operative NSTEMI s/p
stent in the radial to diag graft with subsequent MR (attributed
to papillary muscle dysfunction) and recent admission for CHF
who presented to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room following and
episode of upper extremity shaking followed by emesis. He
reported the sudden onset of chills followed by one episode of
ememsis without any preceding symptoms. He states that he had
been doing quite well residing in the hotel with the visiting
nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 15797**] any preceding cough, SOB, DOE, chest pain,
dizziness, abdominal pain, dysuria or diarrhea. He did report
some right lower extremity pain.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 100.1, 119, 161/76, 16, 100%. He
subsequently became febrile to 103F and tachycardic to the 140s.
An EKG revealed sinus tachycardia to the 120s, downsloping STDs
in I, II, aVL, V3-V6, a deep Q wave in III, a QS in aVR and V1,
and evidence of an IVCD in a left bundle pattern. A comparision
EKG from [**2102-1-20**], revealed sinus rhythm at 73 bpm, TWI in I and
V3-V6, a Q wave in III, QS waves in aVR, and an IVCD in a left
bundle appearence,
On examination, his lungs were clear on examination but he
transiently desaturated to 89% on RA. His lower extremity bypass
incision was noted to be tender to palpation and erythematous.
An ultrasound was performed that did not reveal a simple fluid
collection distal to the graft. Vascular surgery was consulted
and did not believe the source of his fevers were due to an
infected graft. His labs were notable for a WBC of 15.5 with a
left shift (PMNs 83.1%), a hematocrit of 33.9 (recent baseline ~
30), a BUN of 39 and serum creatinine of 1.8 (at recent
baseline). Lactate was 1.7. His troponin was 0.13 (up from 0.08
on [**2102-1-19**] but peaked at 2.22 during his recent NSTEMI) and a
CK-MB was not performed. A urinalysis was negative. Blood
cultures were obtained. A CXR revealed pulmonary edema and but
was also concerning for possible bilateral pneumonias.
He received Vancomycin 1 gm IV, Cefepime 2 gm IV and
Levofloxacin 500 mg IV once for treatment of presumed HCAP. His
systolic blood pressures were still in the 80s after 3L of NS so
a right IJ was placed for initiation of Norepinephrine.
.
On arrival to the MICU, his vitals signs were afebrile, 97,
120s/60s, 20, 90% on RA. Norepinephrine was running at 0.08
mcg/Kg/min and was able to be rapidly weaned to 0.03 mcg/Kg/min,
with systolics remaining in the low 100s. The patient was
fatigued but was in good spirits. He was noted to have
significant bleeding from his right IJ line. His CXR was
reviewed to confirm central line placement, which was noted to
be appropriately placed.
.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI. He [**Date Range 15797**] any preceding cough,
SOB, DOE, chest pain, dizziness, abdominal pain, dysuria or
diarrhea. He did report some right lower extremity pain
