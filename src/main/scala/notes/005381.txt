Service:  [**Company 191**]
Please note a dictation exists for the first few days of this
admission, however, given the complexity and extended course
of this hospitalization, this dictation will cover the time
period between [**2120-10-28**] until discharge on [**2120-11-15**].
REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Hematocrit drop from 38 to 30 and
maroon stools.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year-old
female with multiple medical problems (see below), including
dementia, diabetes type 2, breast cancer, pulmonary fibrosis
and a history of intermittent GI bleeding, is admitted due to
patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
and had a hematocrit of 26 with heme positive stool.  A CAT
scan of the abdomen at that time revealed diverticulosis.
The patient was unable to tolerate a barium enema study.  Due
to her pulmonary disease she was not felt to be a good
candidate for a colonoscopy.  The patient received
transfusions as an outpatient with hematocrit increased to 38
on [**2120-10-22**].  She is currently a resident of
[**Hospital3 41599**] Home and was observed on the day of
admission to passing maroon stool.  Her hematocrit was found
to be 30.  Her systolic blood pressure had decreased from 120
to 100.  The patient denied abdominal pain, chest pain,
shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Breast cancer diagnosed [**2119-10-19**].  Tamoxifen treatment initiated.  Was noted to be an
excisional candidate, however, given improvement and
Tamoxifen, a noninvasive measures were pursued.  Left breast

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6,
hematocrit 30, platelets count 87, chem 7 showed a sodium of
140, potassium 4, chloride 105, bicarbonate of 25, BUN 18,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 173.  PT was 13.7, PTT 26.2, INR 1.3.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient is an 81 year-old female with
dementia, breast cancer, diabetes type 2, pulmonary fibrosis,
admitted with recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleed.  Her
hospital course was complicated by discovery of a large
colonic mass found to be adenocarcinoma of the colon.  Also
complicated by removal of bleeding polyps in the cecum.
Polypectomy was complicated by rebleed requiring repeat
colonoscopy for injection and clipping.  This was followed by
interventional radiology embolization of ileocolic artery.
Also hospital course complicated by need for transfusions of
21 units of packed red blood cells since [**2120-10-18**].
Course also complicated by MRSA bacteremia and multidrug
resistant Klebsiella urinary tract infection.  Course also
complicated by congestive heart failure secondary to massive
blood product requirement.  Also complicated by disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed:
Gastrointestinal Service was consulted for this admission.
[**11-1**] colonoscopy biopsy demonstrated fragments of
adenoma with focal high grade dysplasia.  [**11-5**], repeat
colonoscopy demonstrated bleeding at the cecum that was
controlled with epinephrine and clipping.  A mass was also
noted at the ascending colon with a biopsy consistent with
adenocarcinoma.  Biopsy also demonstrated bleeding from the
previous polypectomy sites.  [**11-7**] interventional
radiology consulted for possible embolization.  Contrast
radiography demonstrated active extravasation originating
from a third order branch arising off the SMA, a branch of
the ileocolic artery.  This was successfully embolized with a
3 mm coil and two 2 cm straight coils.  Follow up angiography
showed no active extravasation.  The procedure was
complicated by a drop coil down the right leg arterial system
with no further sequela.  The patient was given a fourteen
day course of Flagyl for potential ischemic colitis secondary
to massive epinephrine use.  The patient had two mild
episodes of hematochezia subsequent to her embolization.  Her
hematocrit, however, remained stable and was 33.7 on [**11-13**].  The patient's post procedural course was complicated by
abdominal pain that was presumed secondary to the multiple
abdominal manipulations during this admission.  A KUB was
unrevealing on [**11-14**] as were liver function tests and
amylase studies.  After discussion with her family, it was
decided to focus care on comfort, with no futher replacement of
blood products, minimal lab draws, and continuation of IV
antiboitics as long as she maintained IV access; if access was
lost, it would not be replaced.

2.  Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy:  Likely
secondary to multiple infections (see below) and underlying
malignancies.  Treated with aggressive antibiotics and blood
product support.  Status post 5 units of platelets
transfused, status post 7 units of fresh frozen platelets
transfused.  No evidence of active bleeding by the day of
discharge.  Platelets on admission were 87 and stable on
[**11-13**] at 59.  The patient's INR was 1.3 on admission
and 1.4 on [**11-13**].  Fibrinogen was 84 on [**11-13**].

3.  MRSA bacteremia:  The patient had a low grade temperature
on [**11-7**].  Otherwise hospital was afebrile.  Blood
cultures for this admission are [**11-5**] no growth times
two bottles.  [**11-6**] MRSA times two bottles.  [**11-8**], no growth times four bottles.  [**11-11**] and [**11-12**] no growth to date times four bottles.  The patient was
started on Vancomycin and resumed on this medication
secondary to positive blood cultures on [**11-6**].
Surveillance cultures have been negative times six bottles
since.  A PICC line was placed on [**11-13**].  The patient
is day number ten of fourteen on [**11-15**].  Blood cultures
should be rechecked times two on day thirteen or fourteen.
If they are negative then Vancomycin should be discontinued.
If there is any evidence of MRSA then the patient should
complete an additional two week course.

4.  Klebsiella urinary tract infection:  The patient has a
history of recurrent urinary tract infections and yeast
colonization.  A urinalysis wa
