URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):
GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
PROTEUS SPECIES.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..

FINDINGS: Similar to the prior exam, a left chest wall
pacemaker/AICD with
dual contiguous leads remains stable in position and course. The
lungs are
clear without consolidation or edema. Aortic tortuosity with
calcification of the arch is again noted. The cardiac silhouette
remains enlarged but stable.  No effusion or pneumothorax is
noted. A gradual S-shaped scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine
including prior vertebroplasty in the upper lumbar spine is
again noted and likewise stable.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 87 yo F with h/o DM type 2, CML, HTN, HL,
CAD s/p MI in [**2094**] (treated medically), ventricular tachycardia
s/p AICD, and PAF who presents with hyperglycemia.

hyperglycemia/DM2:
The patient was admitted with a blood sugar of 543 and recent
HbA1c of 9.9% ([**2116-12-9**]), up significantly from a previous value
of 6.2% ([**2116-7-8**]). She had been previously diet-controlled until
two weeks prior to admission, when her PCP started her on
glipizide 2.5 mg for her increased HbA1c. The Ddx for her spike
in blood sugars was natural progression, change in diet,
nonadherence to medication, infection (UTI), or cardiac
ischemia. In the ED, she was treated with 5U insulin IV and
started on insulin drip. EKG showed no ischemic changes or
peaked T waves, and CXR showed no acute pulmonary process.
Troponins were <0.02 x3. One day after admission, she was
transitioned off insulin drip onto insulin sliding scale and
Lantus 10U at bedtime. On [**2116-12-24**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] consult was called,
and her evening Lantus was
