Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, n/v

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Mechanical Ventilation
Right internal jugular central venous catheter


History of Present Illness:
50F s/p cholecystectomy, h/o depression, h/o pyelonephritis
presents with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that has
acutely worsened but has been present over last 6 weeks. She has
a h/o of frequent gallstones now s/p choly and nephrolithiasis
for which she often receives lithiotripsy. Patient reports
significant financial stress at home and since then has had
persistent GI complaints. Her abdominal pain is different from
her gallbladder or kidney pain. She describes the pain as
epigastric radiating to her umbilicus and left lower quadrant,
no pain radiating to her back. The pain has worsened and she is
unable to keep anything down and she finally decided to present
to the ED. She also reported diarrhea for one month but has not
had a bowel movement for 6 days. She denies any fevers or
chills. She has lost significant weight and has gone from size
10 pant to size 6 and her dentures no longer fit. She c/o
palpitations and tightness in her chest that often radiates to
her neck and arm. She believes it is related to her anxiety and
she has been having frequent panic attacks. She denies any
shortness of breath.  She reports productive cough over last few
weeks of green sputum. On further ROS, pt reports severe
depression recently but denies SI or SA. She denies any EtOH
use. She also reports a longer history of occasional
word-finding difficulty but no weakness or memory deficits. She
denies dysuria or hematuria. She is post-menopausal but had e/o
vaginal bleeding last month. Had normal pap.
.
In the ED the patient was noted to have elevated lipase and CT
abdomen showed pancreatitis. She received dilaudid 3mg IV and
Morphine 12mg IV with minimal relief of her pain.

Past Medical History:
s/p cholecystectomy
h/o pyelonephritis
recurrent nephrolithiasis s/p multiple episodes lithiotripsy
depression
h/o thrombocytosis thought to be acute phase reaction
h/o pneumonia
fibromyalgia

Social History:
Used to work as nurse, stopped 15 years ago to take care of her
2 daughters. Lives with her husband and children.  Reports
financial strain and recently lost house to foreclosure.  She
smokes about one pack per day. She denies any drug use.

CTA abdomen:
There is new bibasilar atelectasis, without evidence of
effusion. There is a small amount of perihepatic fluid. There is
marked peripancreatic fluid, extending into the anterior
pararenal space bilaterally, with fat stranding without any
evidence of an organizing fluid collection or pseudocyst. There
is normal parenchymal pancreatic enhancement without evidence of
necrosis. The surrounding vessels are normal without evidence of
pseudoaneurysm. There is trace perisplenic fluid, the spleen is
normal. The right adrenal is normal. The left adrenal is
somewhat crowded due to fluid in the lesser sac. There has been
prior cholecystectomy. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and
excrete contrast normally without evidence of hydronephrosis.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy. There is
no free air. The visualized small and large bowel is normal.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is some free fluid in the
pelvis. The
rectum, bladder, and distal ureters are normal.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is minimal DJD.
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute pancreatitis. Marked peripancreatic fluid without
evidence of
organization into a focal collection. No pseudocyst, pancreatic
necrosis or pseudoaneurysm is detected.
2. There is bibasilar atelectasis.
.
MRI abdomen (w/o contrast):
The entire pancreas is swollen and edematous, of heterogeneous
but increased signal intensity on T2-weighted sequence. There is
no evidence of pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is increased
retroperitoneal fluid in addition to ascites. There is a
loculated area of fluid in the anterior pararenal space,
anterior to the head of the pancreas measuring a maximum of 2.8
cm in diameter. There is no evidence of biliary dilatation.
There is no evidence of choledocholithiasis.  There is no focal
liver lesion.
Both kidneys are essentially normal. There is no evidence of
adrenal mass.  There is subcutaneous edema.  It is noted that
the images are degraded by artifacts, and subtle hepatic lesions
for example cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute pancreatitis.
2. No evidence of choledocholithiasis.
3. Retroperitoneal fluid and ascites. Loculated area of fluid
anterior to
the head of the pancreas measuring 2.8 cm in maximum diameter.

TTE [**2188-6-10**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.  IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No
definite evidence of endocarditis. Minimal aortic stenosis. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Preserved biventricular systolic function

CT TORSO ON [**2188-6-9**]
FINDINGS: Right IJ central line terminates at the cavoatrial
junction. There is no pericardial effusion. Hyperdense
interventricular septum indicates underlying anemia. There is a
small left pleural effusion and a tiny right pleural effusion.
Associated atelectatic changes are noted in the surrounding
pulmonary parenchyma. There is a diffuse prominence to the
interlobular septa with peripheral nodular opacities seen
bilaterally which is likely indicative of fluid overload;
however, developing multifocal consolidations is a
consideration. There is underlying mild emphysematous change;
however, respiratory motion artifact limits thorough evaluation.
Trachea and main central airways are patent. There are numerous
mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest seen in prevascular
location measuring approximately 16 x 10 mm.
Large area of pe
