Admission Date: [**2200-8-12**]        Discharge Date: [**2200-8-23**]

Date of Birth:  [**2143-12-29**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NSU


PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:  Right intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 56-year-
old gentleman with a history of alcoholism and asthma.
According to his daughter, he was drinking on [**2200-8-11**] at
approximately four o'clock when she suddenly heard a crashing
sound. She went to the room to look at her father and found
him in bed with some bleeding from his forehead. At that
time, she says he was fine. The fall was unwitnessed. Later
that evening around seven o'clock, Mr. [**Known lastname **] grandson found
him to be unarousable in bed. At that point, they called the
EMS service and he was transported to [**Hospital6 649**]. When he was examined in the hospital, he was
localizing his upper extremities and withdrawing his lower
extremities. He was given Versed, __________, fentanyl and
lidocaine for an intubation around 9:00 p.m. Following this,
he was brought to the CT scan, which showed a right
parietotemporal hemorrhage approximately 5 x 7 cm with 1 cm
midline shift. At the time, his systolic blood pressure was
200.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma, hypertension, diabetes,
alcohol abuse.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Motrin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was febrile with a temperature of
101.4. He had a stable blood pressure when seen of 113/68,
heart rate 87, respiratory rate 18, 98 percent on room air.
He had a laceration of his left eye. Pupils were 2.5 mm and
nonreactive bilaterally. He had normal heart sounds and a
regular heart rate. He had clear lung fields to auscultation.
His abdomen was soft and nontender. When seen in the
Emergency Room, he was intubated and sedated one hour prior
to the examination. His pupils were 2.5 mm and fixed,
nonreactive bilaterally. He had a normal corneal response, as
well as gag and cough. He appeared to extensor posturing both
upper extremities at the time and withdrew lower extremities
to stimulation.

On further examination later in the evening, he was
localizing his right upper extremity with slight movement to
the left upper extremity but not as significant as the right.

LABORATORY DATA:  Upon admission, his labs were unremarkable.
His INR was 1.0 and platelet count of 440. His toxin screen
was negative for alcohol. A CT of the head showed a large
parietotemporal hemorrhage 5 x 7 cm with a 1 cm shift.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was subsequently taken for CT angiogram
to assess for possible vascular abnormalities contributing to
his bleed. The CT angiogram was suggestive of some venous
dilatation in the area of the bleed. Given the CTA findings,
he was taken for an angiogram urgently. The angiogram did not
show any vascular malformations or abnormalities.

In the interim, an A-line was placed for blood pressure
control. Blood pressure medications were started to keep the
systolic blood pressure less than 140. He received mannitol
50 q six hours. He received a Dilantin load. He also received
platelets and DDAVP.

After his angiogram, he was immediately taken to the
Operating Room for evacuation of the right intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. Consent was obtained from the family and the
situation was explained. He underwent a right craniotomy with
evacuation of the hemorrhage. He tolerated the procedure with
no complications. Post procedure, his examination remained
unremarkable. He had minimal movement of his extremities. His
pupils remained 2.5 mm and unreactive. He did not appear to
have a corneal or gag reflex initially. He received another
dose of DDAVP at the end of the procedure. On postoperative
day one, he was much more responsive. He opened his eyes to
stimulation and started lifting his right lower extremity and
arm to stimulation. He remained afebrile with stable vital
signs during his course in the hospital. His platelet count
and coagulopathy labs were normal.

He remained in Intensive Care Unit for several days for close
monitoring while he was intubated. Again, his course in the
hospital remained uneventful. He was afebrile with stable
vital signs. He received perioperative Ancef. Repeat CT
scans, as well as postoperative CT scans showed good
evacuation of the clot with minimal, if any, residual
component. He was rapidly weaned off the Dilantin over 2-3
days. Serial CT scans performed during the wean showed no
significant change.

Ultimately, he was transferred to the floor for further care.
He was extubated prior to transfer and tolerated the
extubation well. He started following commands and moving his
right extremities spontaneously. Over time, he started to
move his left extremities as well, initially the leg more
than the arm. Currently, he moves all four extremities at
least to antigravity.

Speech and _______ assessments were completed. Initially, he
failed the bedside assessment but video esophageal studies
showed that he was able to tolerate thickened and _____ thick
food. He has since been placed on ________ solids and allowed
to take p.o. intake. He does, however, display a significant
left neglect. On [**2200-8-21**] over the night, he leaned to the
right and banged his head against the railing of the bed. No
significant trauma was induced. However, he did have slight
drainage from his wound. Upon inspection, there was a dry
thin layer of blood with no apparent wound dehiscence.

He is being continued to be seen by Occupational Therapy and
Physical Therapy for further help in strengthening. He has
had good improvement. He has continued to do well.
Ultimately, he is discharged to rehabilitation to further
strengthen his extremities.

He has remained stable and is currently ready for discharge
to rehabilitation.

He should follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in two weeks with a
repeat head CT prior to his appointment. He should follow-up
with his primary care physician in one week for further
assessment. He should continue on his Dilantin until seen in
follow-up. He should have serial Dilantin levels checked
while in rehabilitation to assure that he is at a therapeutic
level. His incision requires daily dry dressing changes, as
well as antibiotic ointment application daily. Please
reassess his ability to take oral food after a few days of
rehabilitation.
