Service:  ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 1395**] is a 79-year-old woman
with a severe history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, a history of a benign lung tumor, with a left lower
lobe resection 20 years prior to admission who was initially
admitted to the A-Cove Service on [**4-24**] with a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

Six days prior to admission she had felt fatigued with
fevers.  She had a temperature spike to 100 at home.  Her
visiting nurse felt that she was breathing poorly, had a fast
heart rate, and appeared weak and had her evaluated in the
Emergency Room.  The patient did not complain of cough,
hemoptysis, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.  She had
lost approximately seven pounds in the preceding six months.

In the Emergency Room, her temperature was 99.8.  Her heart
rate was 107.  Her blood pressure was 144/77, and her
respiratory rate was 20, with a saturation of 97%.  She
appeared comfortable, spoke in full sentences.  A chest x-ray
was remarkable for a left upper lobe spiculated opacity; new
since [**2114-8-4**] and concerning for pneumonia, tumor,
or tubercular infection.

A CT scan was obtained and was pending while she was
evaluated in the Emergency Room.  She was initially treated
with normal saline, levofloxacin intravenously, albuterol,
and Atrovent and admitted to the A-Cove Service for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  A benign lung lesion; status post resection 20 years
prior.
3.  Breast cancer, status post lumpectomy with radiation
therapy.
4.  Rectal cancer, status post radiation therapy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission were)
1.  Flovent 220 4 puffs b.i.d.
2.  Albuterol 2 puffs q.4h.
3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. q.h.s.
5.  Rhinocort.
6.  Tylenol.
7.  Home oxygen at 2 liters.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A nonsmoker currently, but with a
37-pack-year history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On admission
temperature was 98.9, blood pressure was 126/62, heart rate
was 108, respiratory rate was 20, saturating at 99% on 2
liters.  In general, a cachectic, frail, elderly woman
speaking in full sentences on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Pupils
were equal, round and reactive to light.  Sclerae were clear.
Heart rate and rhythm were regular with a normal first heart
sound and second heart sound.  She had a high-pitched
inspiratory wheeze bilaterally in her upper lobes, left
greater than right.  Her abdomen was soft and nondistended.
It was tender in the right upper quadrant to deep palpation.
She had multiple ecchymoses diffusely with peripheral tissue
wasting.  She had no rash.  Neurologically, she was alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
on admission revealed she had a white blood cell count
of 13.2 (which was elevated from a prior of 11.2), hematocrit
was 35 (down from the 40s), and a platelet count of 479.
Sodium was 1453,, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 99,
bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen was 22, creatinine
was 0.7, blood glucose was 92.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus
tachycardia at 123, normal axis.  No ST changes.

A chest x-ray revealed increasing opacity with spiculated
appearance, chordae at the left apex in a region previously
described as scarring; worrisome for scar, carcinoma, or
recurrent tumor.  Also concerning for infectious source.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 1395**] was initially admitted to the
A-Cove Service for further management of pneumonia versus
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

Given the findings on her chest x-ray, the Pulmonary Service
was consulted, and she underwent a diagnostic bronchoscopy
and lavage.  She tolerated the procedure poorly and needed to
initially be placed on BiPAP and admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

Shortly after being admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, she
had severe respiratory decompensation and required intubation
for management of her respiratory.  She also had an A-line
placed.

Over the subsequent 12 days in the Intensive Care Unit,
Ms. [**Known lastname 1395**] was treated aggressively for presumed pneumonia;
although no infectious source was ever found.  She was also
treated aggressively for a chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation with high-dose steroids as well as
inhaled bronchodilators and Atrovent.

Despite these intense interventions, she remained ventilatory
dependent requiring pressor support at all times.  She failed
to tolerate several attempts to wean.  During this time, the
Medical Intensive Care Unit team was in close contact with
the patient's family including her daughters.  The patient
did remain alert and able to interact and confirm her wishes
during this course.

Toward the end of her admission, it became evident that she
would require a tracheostomy to further maintain her
ventilatory status.  This was discussed with her daughters
and with Ms. [**Known lastname 1395**] as well.  Mr. [**Known lastname 1395**] made it quite clear
that she did not wish tracheostomy, and this was confirmed by
her daughters.

On [**2115-5-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname 1395**] deliberately self-extubated
herself.  She was initially placed on a mask and CPAP.  Her
attending and family were notified, and the decision not to
reintubate was confirmed.

She was started on a morphine drip for comfort, and her
family and sister were present.  She ultimately expired on
[**5-10**].  An autopsy was declined.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
2.  Pneumonia.
