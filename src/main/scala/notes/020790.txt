History of Present Illness:
74 year old male who presented with chest pain and shortness of
breath on exertion. Patient was well until 3-4 weeks ago when he
noticed exertional dyspnea when climbing a flight of stairs or
out shopping. This has progressed to where the patient now has
substernal "chest pressure" or "heavyness" when walking [**1-10**]
blocks or climbing 1 flight of stairs in his home. He also notes
some SOB upon awakening in the mornings, but denies PND. He
sleeps with 2 pillows at baseline, but reports that his
breathing is improved when he's upright lately. He denies any
symptoms of chest pain/pressure or SOB at rest.

irregular heart beat, S1 and the S2 were normal. There were no
rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was obese, soft
nontender and nondistended. His liver span was estimated to be
5cm by percussion. He did not have a palpable spleen. The
extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema. There
were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits. skin revealed
darkened skin on dorsum of both hands, with pale lower
extremities which pt relates to sun eposure. no evidence of
stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Rectal Exam: Smooth symmetrically enlarged prostate with brown
stool in rectal vault. Guaiac Negative.

[**2133-1-30**] Echocardiogram:  EF 35-40%, the left atrium is mildly
dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed with
thinned and akinetic inferior/inferolateral. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2130-3-27**], findings are similar.

[**2133-2-2**] Chest X-ray: 1. Subpleural areas of reticular opacity
with associated traction bronchiectasis, corresponding to the
abnormalities seen on the recent chest radiograph. Findings
likely reflect sequela of prior infectious etiology or chronic
aspiration.
2. Panacinar emphysema with upper lobe predominance.
3. Extensive coronary artery calcifications.

[**2133-2-3**] Bladder U/S: Arising from the left posterior bladder
wall, there is a 1.7 x 1.2 x 2.1 cm soft tissue lesion. The
lesion is solid, therefore this would not be consistent with an
ureterocele and more concerning for a bladder mass or benign
solid lesion. When compared to the prior CT of [**2130-8-8**],
the greatest dimension has slightly increased in size (from 1.8
to 2.1 cm). Normal bilateral ureter jets are seen. No other
bladder abnormalities are detected.
1.7 x 1.2 x 2.1 soft tissue lesion arising from the left
posterior bladder wall adjacent to the orifice of the left
ureter. Given slight interval growth compared to CT of [**Month (only) 216**]
[**2129**] and solid appearance this may represent a benign or
malignant solid lesion and further workup with cystoscopy is
recommended.

[**2133-1-30**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated filling pressures.
3. Depresed cardiac index.
4. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
5. Moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Presented for evaluation of chest pain, started on heparin for
atrial fibrillation and underwent cardiac catheterization
[**2133-1-30**] which revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
Cardiac Surgery was consulted and he underwent preoperative
workup.  While on heparin he developed both hematuria and bright
red blood per rectum.  A bladder ultrasound revealed a mass and
urology was consulted.  Bladder irrigation was started and he
was cleared by urology for cardiac surgery.  GI was consulted,
his hematocrit dropped by 2 points and he was cleared for
surgery. Heparin and plavix were stopped in anticipation of
surgery and given his bleeding.  He went to the operating room
on [**2133-2-3**] where coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels
was performed as well as a mitral valve repair using a 26mm
[**Company **] band. Of note, left radial artery, internal mammary
and saphenous vein was used for bypass conduit. Please see
operative report for further details. Postoperatively he was
transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit for further
monitoring. He required bladder irrigation for hematuria in the
OR which was continued in the unit. Initially he required
milrinone and pressors which were weaned off over 24 hours. On
postoperative day one, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Bladder irrigation was stopped and he remained
without hematuria.  On POD #2 he had atrial fibrillation which
was treated with beta blockers and amiodarone. The renal service
was consulted for an elevated creatinine which slowly trended
back towards normal. As he remained in atrial fibrillation,
heparin as a bridge to coumadin was started for anticoagulation.
He continued to make slow progress and remained in the unit for
pulmonary care and diuresis until postoperative day six. He was
then transferred to th
