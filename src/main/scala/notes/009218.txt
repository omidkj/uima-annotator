Right Femoral Ultrasound: [**2135-4-19**]
Patent right common femoral artery without evidence of
pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula, or hematoma.
.
[**2135-4-18**]
1. A patent left proximal common carotid artery.
2. Widely patent left external carotid artery.
3. The left internal carotid artery had a critical 99%
    stenosis spanning 2-3 cm approximately 1 cm distal to
    its origin. Successful stenting of the internal carotid
    artery stenosis was performed with a 10-mm Wallstent
    followed by a 5-mm balloon angioplasty of the stent with
    resultant widely patent flow through the common carotid,
    internal carotid and external carotid arteries with
    minimal 10% residual stenosis in the center of the
    stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 67yoM O2-dependant COPD, htn, DMII, ?syncopal hx admitted
for coronary angiography, revealed near 100% L-ICA, >95% R-ICA,
s/p R-ICA stenting x2, admitted to CCU for tight BP control post
procedure.
.
# PVD/CAD - significant L/R-ICA disease, with multiple
ulcerations and dissections of R-ICA artery, now s/p stent
placement x2 to R-ICA . On this admission he had placement of a
L-ICA stent. Given his cerebral vessels decreased capacity to
autoregulate, the degree of hypoperfusion was limited with
dopamine. MAPs remained between 80 and 120 and his dopamine was
subsequently discontinued. He continued to receive aspirin,
plavix, metoprolol, and ezetemibe on discharge.He was noted to
have a right femoral artery bruit on arrival the CCU. A right
femoral ultrasound did not reveal any pseudoanuerysm, hematoma
or AV fistula. he will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
.
# DM - continued glyburide, avandia
.
# Hypercholesterolemia - continued ezetemibe, atorvastatin
.
# COPD/OSA - continued advair, albuterol nebs prn, cpap.
.
# Shoulder pain: continued percocet.
