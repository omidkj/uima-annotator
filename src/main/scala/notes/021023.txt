Chief Complaint:
chest pain, dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
.
HPI: 84yo man with PMH of s/p colostomy for UC, presents with
dyspnea x several days associated with cough and increasing
episodes of chest pain relieved by sl NTG. Per the pt's family,
he has had several years of dyspnea on exertion. He was in his
USOH until several weeks ago, when they noticed increasing
dyspnea with little exertion and cough productive of white
phlegm, which is new for him. Beginning several days prior to
admission, he began to have episodes of chest pain which were
relieved with one sublingual NTG. Per the ED note, these
episodes of SSCP, occurring at rest, had no radiation and lasted
several minutes. Today, he had an episode witnessed by his
family, when he had dyspnea and looked [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] they brought him
to the emergency room. Per the family, he has never used NTG
prior to the past several days. They are unaware of any heart
problems he may have or why his PCP prescribed NTG in the first
place. Family denies PND, edema, palpitations. Notes recent PCP
visit [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/ ECHO, unclear results.
.
In the ED, the pt was noted to be tachycardic and in mild
respiratory distress. He had JVP to his jaw and crackles at
bilateral lung bases. A CXR showed mild CHF and an EKG showed
atrial flutter with ventricular rate to 130s. He was also noted
to have positive cardiac enzymes with troponin 3.16, CK 302, MB
27, MBI 8.9. Heparin was initiated. His BP fell to 70s/50s, and
he was cardioverted at 150J with successful conversion to NSR
(after attempting with 1 amp calcium, D50, and insulin for
hyperkalemia to 5.5). He was noted to have increased dyspnea and
sats 85% on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was given 40mg IV lasix x 2. He was
started on a nitro gtt to decrease preload and placed on BIPAP
with resulting sats of 100%.

BRAIN MRI IMPRESSION:
1. Large subacute borderzone distribution infarct. Small
subacute right distal anterior cerebral artery distribution
infarct.
2. Evidence of hemorrhagic transformation on right near cranial
vertex.
3. Abnormal flow-related signal in petrous portion of right
internal carotid artery. Evaluation was severely limited
secondary to patient motion. Focal areas of stenosis, or even
dissection, cannot be excluded.
4. Both middle cerebral arteries and anterior cerebral arteries
are grossly patent on this limited MRA.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with cardiogenic shock to the CCU.  He
was supported with pressors and fluids.  The patient had an
acute on chronic renal failure with oliguria.  Echo revealed a
very low EF of <20%.  CCU care at the time focused on reducing
the afterload to allow forward flow.  Subsequent diuresis caused
a reduction in creatinine.  It was subsequently determined that
the patient had been volume overloaded and diuresis was
continued.  He had output from his ostomy and c dif was checked
and negative.  He also developed weakness of his L side and
hemineglect, which MRI subsequently showed to be due to a
massive MCA and ACA thrombotic/embolic stroke with subsequent
hemorrhagic conversion at the apex of the brain.  The patient
never received anticoagulation for this reason.

The patient's family knew that he would have prefered not to
live with a PEG, but the patient was temporarily outfitted with
a dobhoff tube and fed tube feeds.  The patient appeared to be
temporarily stable and discussions regarding his future placemnt
were initiated with the family.  During this period he began to
have a rising creatinine.  It was not clear at this time whether
his voume status was increased or decreased.  He then developed
large volume outputs through his ostomy after receiving
kayexalate for an increased potassium in the setting of rising
creatinine.  At this point it was felt that he was volume
depleted and volume resuscitation was initiated.  The patient's
potassium continued to rise despite multiple kayexalate rounds.
The patient became anuric.  Palliative care was consulted to
help with decision making.

In the face of rising potassium despite kayexalate and anuria,
it was discussed with the patient's family that the chances of
recovery was slim.  HD was not felt to be a reasonable option
and the patient was made CMO.  He died comfortably at 4:41am on
[**2142-10-6**].  Family was contact[**Name (NI) **] immediately.
