Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
left uper lobe nodule

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2166-10-8**]:
1. Bronchoscopy.
2. Cervical mediastinoscopy.
3. Left thoracotomy with upper lobe bisegmentectomy and
lower lobe bullectomy

[**2166-10-17**]:
1. Tracheostomy.
2. Bronchoscopy with aspiration of secretions.
3. Laparotomy with tube gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy

*Patient also underwent multiple (greater than 10) flexible
bedside bronchoscopies for therapeutic aspiration of retained
secretions.

History of Present Illness:
  Mr. [**Known lastname 6330**] is a 56-year-old gentleman with
greater than 100 pack-year smoking history and severe
emphysema with an enlarging spiculated PET positive lesion on
the left upper lobe. He has severe protein calorie
malnutrition and severe emphysema. He has completed pulmonary
rehab and gained several pounds suggesting positive nitrogen
balance. A remote metastatic survey was unremarkable and I
recommended mediastinal staging and, if node-negative, a
segmental anatomic resection as a reasonable compromise for
what we suspected was a carcinoma but also considering his
severe underlying emphysema. He had chronic total atelectasis
of the left lower lobe with a bronchoscopy in the past
excluding an endobronchial lesion so we hoped to recruit some
of this. He agreed to proceed.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
56 year old man s/p LUL lobectomy with 1 left chest tube. s/p
bronchoscopy
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval LLL collapse, right upper lobe infiltrate
PORTABLE CHEST: [**2166-11-17**]

COMPARISON: [**2166-11-16**].

INDICATION: Status post left upper lobectomy. Evaluate left
lower lobe collapse and right upper lobe infiltrate.

A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position, but the
cuff is over-distended. A left-sided chest tube and left PICC
line remain in place, not significantly changed. There remains
collapse of the majority of the remaining portion of the left
lung. A moderate amount of pleural fluid is present in the left
hemithorax, and there is a persistent lucency at the left apex,
attributed to a hydropneumothorax. Additional rounded lucencies
are seen in the left mid lung zone region and may be due to
areas of necrotizing lung parenchyma based on prior CT exam
findings. Heterogeneous opacification persists throughout the
right lung as well as a small-to-moderate right pleural
effusion.

As compared to the recent study, there has been slight interval
increase in degree of opacification in the left hemithorax,
which may be due to a combination of worsening atelectasis and
increasing pleural effusion. There is otherwise no significant
change since the recent study.
