DIAGNOSIS:



Right pleural implant, biopsy (A-B):



     Chronic pleuritis with reactive mesothelial hyperplasia and
focal granulation tissue.



Right lower lobe nodule, wedge resection (C-D):



     Pleural tissue with fibrous adhesions.



Right lower lobe superior segment, wedge resection (E-I):



     - Organizing pneumonia (bronchiolitis obliterans organizing
pneumonia).

     - Intra-parenchymal lymph node, negative for malignancy.

     - Respiratory bronchiolitis.

     - No evidence of malignancy.



4R lymph node, excision (J-L):



     Negative for malignancy.



Level 7 lymph node, excision (M):



     Negative for malignancy.

Echo [**2110-1-20**] Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). The severity of aortic regurgitation
may be underestimated. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2110-1-23**] Bilateral upper arterial and venous duplex:
IMPRESSION: Patent bilateral brachial and radial arteries with
diameters
described above.

[**2110-1-22**] CXR:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-21**], there has been
some decrease in the opacifications at the right base. Some of
this may reflect change in patient position with decreased
layering of pleural fluid. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels,
most prominent on the right, is consistent with asymmetric
pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting,
supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 89482**] was taken to the operating room on [**2110-1-17**] for a
Right video-assisted thoracoscopy lung wedge, pleural biopsy,
and lymph node dissection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for suspicious
looking lung nodules and a PET avid left upper lobe mass. He was
transfered initally from PACU to ICU for hemodialysis needs
postoperatively along with monitoring. He remained for pulmonary
edema, CRRT, and atrial fibrillation until stabilized and
transfered to the floor on [**2109-1-22**]. He was discharged home on
[**2110-1-27**] with VNA services. Below is a systems review of his
hospital course:

Neuro: The patient was initially given PCA dilaudid for pain,
which then converted to IV q 4hour prn, then to tylenol for pain
control. He did not complain of pain once awake post extubation,
and was sent home on prn tylenol. He remained neurologically
intact throughout his stay. While intubated propofol and
fentanyl were used.

Pulmonary: The patient required CPAP postoperatively, then at
onset of HD became acutely hypoxic and required intubation
[**2110-1-18**] with mechanical ventilation. He was kept intubated until
[**2110-1-20**]. Pulmonary toilet was continued. A right chest tube was
discontinued [**2110-1-19**] after surgery and postpull chest xray did
not reveal any pneumothorax.
Pathology from RVATS wedge revealed organizing pneumonia. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 575**] with Pulmonary was consulted and felt that he should
have repeat CT in [**1-16**] weeks which was ordered for followup with
us on [**2110-2-6**]. He will have followup with pulmonologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 89483**] at [**Location (un) **] after CT chest. This is being scheduled. The
patient is aware. The patient room air oxygen saturation on day
of discharge were 95%.

CV: On POD 1, after HD initiated the patient went into atrial
fibrillation with RVR 150 with hemodynamic instability requiring
cardioversion with shock x 2. He was bolused with amiodarone and
continued with drip load. [**2110-1-19**] a run of VTach noted, with IV
lopressor given. The patient was transitioned to oral amiodarone
400mg po BID which he received 7 days of and sent home on 200mg
po daily. He was placed on lopressor [**2110-1-19**] which was uptitrated
to 100mg XL [**Hospital1 **] on [**2110-1-24**]. Diltiazem was added on [**1-22**] and
stopped [**2110-1-24**] for some short term burst afib on, which
resolved after 10mg IV dilt on [**2110-1-22**]. His other lisinopril and
amlodipine was discontinued given these new medications.

Cardiology was consulted early on ([**1-20**]) in management of his
arrhythmias, and assisted in management of his afib. Ec
