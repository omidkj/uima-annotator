Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchial stent revision

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90972**] is a 72 yo F with a history of stage IIIb squamous
cell carcinoma (dx [**1-/2166**], s/p chemo/radiation in [**State **],
recently c/b bronchial obstruction in right mainstem and
bronchus intermedius requiring stenting). She came to the
hospital today for scheduled bronchial stent revision. Per
report she had a rigid bronchoscopy which showed that the
previously placed silicon stent in her right mainstem bronchus
was in good position but the lumen was clogged up with necrotic
tissue/ tumor and secretion. Therapeutic aspiration was
performed and a wash was done. [**Doctor Last Name **] ballon was used to dilate
the completely occluded RML. There were no clear operative
complications and blood loss was estimated at 5cc. However while
in the PACU the patient had persistent hypotension to the 70s
systolic and she received a total of 2.5 liters of fluid. She
was also given 40mg of solumedrol out of concern for adrenal
insufficiency (was recently on a short course of prednisone
several weeks ago, not currently on steroids). She was not given
any antibiotics. At the time of initial MICU resident evaluation
in the PACU the patient was afebrile, HR 74 SBP 70/52, 96% on
4liters. She was mentating well and oriented X3

who is undergoing a stem cell transplant at [**Hospital1 18**]. She is
currently living with her other son [**Name (NI) **].

ECHO [**2166-7-31**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild posterior leaflet mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion

CHEST CT [**2166-8-1**]:
1.  Near complete right lung opacification is largely due to a
combination of
volume loss and infection. The right pleural effusion is
small-moderate,
extending to the apex. The PleurX catheter ends in the right
posterior
costophrenic sulcus within a small amount of fluid.

2.  Moderate left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
The aerated
left lung is clear with mild emphysema.

3.  Patent but narrowed right mainstem bronchus.  Narrowed
bronchus
intermedius and right upper lobe bronchus terminating abruptly.
Soft tissue
encasing the bronchus is likely consistent with known malignancy
and is best
evaluated with contrast.

4.  12-mm left pericardial lymph node.


Brief Hospital Course:
72F with stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma (diagnosed [**1-/2166**],
s/p chemo/XRT) recently c/b bronchial obstruction in right
mainstem and bronchus intermedius requiring stenting and
multiple IP procedures, with R PleurX catheter in place,
transferred to ICU for hypotension post-bronchoscopy, currently
off pressors.

ACTIVE ISSUES

#) Hypotension: Patient with baseline blood pressures in the
systolic 80s-low 100s per her report and OMR notes.  She was
started on neosynephrine, which was eventually able to be weaned
for goal SBPs 90-low 100s.  She was emperically covered with
vancomycin and zosyn but all cultures were negative and she was
narrowed to augmentin to cover for post-obstructive PNA, however
re-started back on vanc/zosyn when she decompensated after a
further bronch procedure.  TTE showed no evidence of tamponade,
but showed a trivial pericardial effusion.  After transfer to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she did not require pressors and her hypotension resolved.
The differential was thought to include sepsis secondary to
post-obstructive PNA, but more likely SIRS response
post-bronchoscopy. Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out with
normal AM cortisol. Patient was weaned off pheylephrine,
midodrine, and fludrocortisone and her BP has been stable on the
floor.

#) Possible post-obstructive pneumonia:  Pt with tenuous
respiratory status, spiked fever during ICU stay, and treated
presumptively for possible post-obstructive PNA.   Completed a 2
week course of antibiotics including vancomycin/Zosyn x 8 days
(in addition to Augmentin x5 days earlier).

#) Dyspnea/Respiratory failure (hypercarbic and hypoxemic):
Thought to be likely multifactorial in etiology, in setting of
lung cancer, obstructive lesion, RUL collapse, pleural effusion,
possible post-obstructive pneumonia, and ? underlying COPD.  No
previous diagnosis of COPD, though imaging this admission has
been suggestive of COPD.  She received Advair and albuterol nebs
with good relief. She has PleurX in place for palliative
drainage of her right pleural effusion.  This is draining very
minimal fluid and can now be checked qweekly (last drained
Thursday [**8-7**]).   The patient was offered palliative
thoracentesis for the left pleural effusion by interventional
pulmonary and she has declined.

She has continued O2 requirement of [**3-7**] L NC and desats easily
with minimal exertion.  Even sitting up to eat can cause
dyspnea.  This is not expected to improve much further,
unfortunately, and care should be focused on relieving symptoms.
 Have discussed with interventional pulmonary and it is unlikely
that further procedures would greatly change her course given
her end-stage disease (see goals of care below)

We have initiated oral morphine for relief of dyspnea and
