Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for thoracic aortic aneurysm repair

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
61 y/o female with COPD, PVD and critical central airway
obstruction at the distal trachea (<1cm) secondary to thoracic
aortic aneurysm, transferred for vascular surgery consult prior
to IP intervention to determine sequence of events.
.
Pt initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2153-1-12**] for SOB.
States she had had cough prior, and then noted to desaturate to
low 80's while in ED there. She was subsequently intubated. Pt
then went into PEA, received epi and atropine, went into VT, was
shocked x 1, and regained pulse w/ sinus tach. She was
transferred to the ICU at the OSH. She was initially maintained
on amiodarone gtt. Right subclavian line was placed. She was
treated for COPD exacerbation with solumedrol 60mg IV Q8, in
addition to azithromycin and ceftriaxone due to concern for RUL
infiltrate. She was also diuresed w/ lasix 40mg IV Q8, then
transitioned to PO diuresis with lasix 40mg PO BID yesterday.
BNP was 750 at OSH. She was extubated on [**2153-1-14**], with ABG
7.46/48/60/91 on CPAP prior to extubation (no repeat ABG's have
been done). She was saturating at 92% on 5L NC prior to
transfer. In addition, patient was ruled out for MI per history,
with peak troponin of 0.10 at OSH (ranging 0.06-->0.10-->0.06 w/
flat CKs).
.
Patient now says she feels comfortable.  Does complain of
intermittent "crampy chest pain", which she states has been
going on for weeks (and nonexertional). No radiation, no
diaphoresis, no N/V. No CP with previous MI. Denies
fevers/chills. States her cough has been dry. No
hospitalizations since [**Month (only) 547**] and comes from home.

Pertinent Results:
I. Radiology

A. CXR
HISTORY: Systolic CHF recently extubate, to assess for edema or
infiltrate.

FINDINGS: No previous images. There is substantial enlargement
of the
cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta and evidence of
pulmonary
vascular congestion. Probable left effusion with some bibasilar
atelectatic
changes. Central catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC.

CT chest ([**1-12**]) -- OSH read
No e/o PE or aortic dissection. Diffuse consolidated lung
parenchyma with right upper lobe posteriorly and bilateral lower
lobes. Diffuse increased interstitial markings consistent w/ CHF
with bilateral pleural effusions right slightly greater than
left. Cardiomegaly. Aortic root measures approximately 6cm
transversely at the level of the coronary vessels.

II. Cardiology

A. ECHO
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed with inferior/inferolateral
akinesis, inferoseptal akinesis/hypokinesis and hypokinesis
elsewhere. (LVEF= 25-30 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined (it
is at least mildly elevated). There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o female with COPD requiring home O2 (PFTs not available),
peripheral vascular disease, questionable tracheobronchomalacia
perhaps secondary to airway compression by thoracic aneurysm,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiomyopathy (EF 25-30%)
suggestive of prior MI, who presented initially to [**Hospital1 **] with shortness of breath with subsequent PEA
arrest/ventricular fibrillation with COPD exacerbation and
systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation. Rest of hospital
course was largely unremarkable.  She was treated for COPD
exacerbation.

# Hypercarbic and Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Patient likely
had COPD exacerbation Given absence of leukocytosis, fever,
pneumonia felt less likely. Pulmonary embolism consideration but
unlikely given clinical response to therapy. Patient maintaining
saturations of 91-93 % on supplemental oxygen. Interventional
pulmonary consulted and felt that compression of mid-trachea;
however, the compression does not seem severe enough to explain
presenting clinical picture. She was treated with a 5-day course
of azithromycin and ceftriaxone (the latter for a presumed RUL
pneumonia) in addition to nebs and steroid taper.

Patient will need PFTs either inpatient or outpatient for
further characterization of her COPD and medical management
regarding her aneurysm.

# Tracheobronchomalacia: Patient is to follow-up on outpatient
basis with interventional pulmonology for further work-up and
consideration of stent.
.

# Acute on chronic systolic CHF (EF 25-35%):
Patient's ECHO is suggestive of prior myocardial infarction. She
appeared volume overloaded with pulmonary edema on CXR. She was
subsequently diuresed and started on labetalol. Etiology felt to
be secondary to the recent PEA arrest.

She was discharged on an ACEi, statin, ASA, and beta-blocker.

# Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm:
Patient with new 6cm thoracic aortic aneurysm, transferred for
repair. Cardiac surgery consulted and will evaluate the patient
as an outpatient for elective surgery.  Cardiology was consulted
and will follow the patient and potentially plan for a pre-op
cath to evaluate for CAD.

The decision regarding surgery was felt to be complex given her
underlying multiple co-morbidities. Cardiology was consulted for
pre-operative evaluation. Her RCRI perioperative risk of MI or
cardiac death is approximately 5.4 %, and medical optimization
was recommended including lisinopril, statin, ASA, and beta
blockade. She will likely need a pre-OR cardiac cath if she
undergoes surgery.
.

# Status post Cardiopulmonary Arrest:
After intubation, patient went into PEA arrest. Definitive
etiology unknown but given COPD, could have auto-PEEP or had
decreased venous return during inciden
