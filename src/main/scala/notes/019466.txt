HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old female
with a history of critical aortic stenosis with congenital
hemangioma of the chest making her what was thought to be an
inoperable candidate for aortic valve replacement, who had
had an increase of her dyspnea on exertion over the past
three to four months with a previous admission in [**2183-9-9**], for congestive heart failure, being treated with Lasix.
She presented in [**Month (only) 956**] with continued increased shortness
of breath for which she was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for
reevaluation for possible aortic valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Congenital hemangioma of her chest.
4.  Congenital telangiectasis syndrome which has required
upper airway obstruction requiring tracheostomy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Appendectomy approximately thirty-five years ago.
2.  Attempted removal of congenital hemangioma approximately
thirty years ago.
3.  Tracheostomy eleven years ago.
4.  The patient denies hypertension, hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Glipizide 10 mg once daily.
2.  Glucophage one gram twice a day.
3.  Lasix 60 mg twice a day.
4.  Potassium 20 meq twice a day.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which causes a rash.  Ceclor which
causes a rash.  Latex which causes bronchospasm.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient never smoked.  She denied
recreational drug use.  She lives with her daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination
revealed vital signs with a heart rate of 54, normal sinus
rhythm, blood pressure 108/74, weight 130 pounds, height five
foot one inch.  In general, the patient is a well developed,
well nourished female in no apparent distress appearing
stated age, well hydrated.  Face - positive for right face
and neck hemangioma  Right eye with conjunctivitis and
hemangioma noted.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are
intact.  Normal buccal mucosa with partial upper dentures.
The neck is supple with right submandibular lymphadenopathy,
no jugular venous distention, no thyromegaly, with intact
tracheostomy.  Chest - mild rales at the right base, no
wheezes.  The heart is regular rate and rhythm, positive S1
and S2, positive III/VI murmur at the right sternal border at
first intercostal space radiating to the carotids.  The
abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel
sounds, no guarding or rebound.  Extremities are warm, no
edema, no cyanosis.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II
through XII are intact.  Pulses - femoral right 2+ and left
2+, dorsalis pedis 1+ bilaterally, posterior tibial 1+
bilaterally, radial 2+ bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Echocardiogram performed on [**2183-9-24**],
demonstrated an aortic valve which was heavily calcified with
critical stenosis present, peak gradient was measured at 80
to 90 mmHg with a mean gradient of 53 mmHg.  The valve area
was estimated to be 0.5 centimeter squared.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Surgery service for evaluation for aortic valve replacement.
This plan was complicated by an upper airway congenital
hemangioma precluding a direct sternotomy approach.  The plan
was for first tracheal dilation which would be necessary for
appropriate management in a surgical situation.  An apical
aortic conduit on femoral femoral bypass was considered for
potential approach.  On [**2184-2-16**], the patient had tracheal
stoma dilation and a flexible bronchoscopy which was
performed without complication.  The patient continued to do
well after this procedure and magnetic resonance scan to
evaluate the hemangioma was obtained.  The patient was noted
to have multiple premature atrial contractions and was
started on Lopressor 12.5 mg twice a day with good control.
Of note, the patient's sodium trended upward at 152, and this
was treated with free water boluses via nasogastric tube.
The free water boluses appropriately corrected the free water
deficit.  Of note, during the tracheal dilation, the patient
did have episode of flash pulmonary edema which was treated
with intravenous Lasix with good response.  The patient was
on Lasix 60 mg twice a day as an outpatient, and this was
continued with p.r.n. intravenous Lasix as needed.  The
patient was started on tube feeds for nutrition and a HIT
antibody was sent on [**2184-2-20**], since platelets had dropped
from 113,000 to 67,000.  This came back negative.  On
[**2184-2-20**], it was determined since the patient had issues with
pulmonary edema, and was not an immediate candidate for valve
replacement, the patient was transferred to the CCU service
for medical management.

On transfer, the patient actually appeared to be easily
managed, thus goals were to keep inputs equal to outputs.
Lasix was decreased from 60 p.o. twice a day to 60 mg once
daily with appropriate response.  Gentle free water repletion
was continued.  At this point, her sodium was 149.  Upon
transfer, the patient had a repeat echocardiogram to evaluate
for aortic insufficiency in the setting of critical aortic
stenosis which would also determine further management.  The
ejection fraction was 40%.  The aortic valve area was 0.5,
peak gradient 82, mean of 53, left atrium mildly dilated with
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild global left
hypokinesis, somewhat severe aortic stenosis, 1+ aortic
regurgitation and 1+ mitral regurgitation.  The patient's
sodium was 147 the following day.  The patient's course
remained uncomplicated with the exception of a temperature
spike to 101.4.  The patient was pancultured which
demonstrated an Enterococcus urinary tract infection, which
was sensitive to Levofloxacin.  The patient was put on a ten
to fourteen day course of Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.  Once the
antibiotic therapy was instituted, the patient was afebrile.
Of concern, one blood culture came back positive, which was
determined to be coagulase negative Staphylococcus.  The
patient had a midline in for access, and this was removed at
that time without difficulty.  The patient remained afebrile
and no other blood culture became positive.  The patient
continued to be monitored on the floor without event.
Physical therapy was consulted who deemed the patient was
safe for return back to home with her daughter.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was discharged home on [**2184-2-25**], with VNA for
continued tracheostomy care, respiratory care and management
of secretions, as well as assess for any other needs while at
home.  Disposition was discussed with the thoracic team who
stated that the patient was tentatively scheduled for
surgical intervention approximately one week after discharge
on [**2184-2-25**].  The patient was given Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2546**] office
number, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 28544**], and was instructed to call should they
not hear from the office with an operating room date.  The
patient was also instructed to call primary care physician
should she have any new onset shortness of breath, which may
require institution of her usual second dose of Lasix each
day.

1.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. twice a day.
