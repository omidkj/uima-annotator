Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

PEG tube placement
Spinal Tap
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 75 yo man with multiple myeloma in who presents from rehab
with altered mental status over past 7 days. History taken from
daughter who sees him daily at rehab. She states he is alert and
oriented at baseline but over the past 5-7 days has had poor
oral intake and has been less verbal than usual. She states he
usually knows his name and recognizes her but she admits he is
sometimes 'confused' and this is not a new process. He had
denied any cough, pain, dysuria, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea
and the rehab facility did not report any of these symptoms as
well.
.
In the ER urinalysis with many WBC's and bacteria, CXR clear on
my read, CT head with no acute process. Patient was given
vancomycin and zosyn in the ER. Vitals stable in ER, T 98 but
rose to 100.8 later on. Received 2.5 liters saline. Foley
catheter placed in ER.

Studies:
-[**2121-9-18**] CT chest/abd/pevlis: 1. Bilateral moderate-sized
pleural effusions, with bibasilar airspace opacifications,
likely atelectasis; however, superinfection or aspiration cannot
be excluded.
2. Cardiomegaly. 3. Bilateral hypodensities in the kidneys, not
characterized on the current scan. These could be further
evaluated with ultrasound. Nonspecific fat stranding around the
kidneys, correlate with urinary analysis. 4. Anasarca. 5.
Suggestion of wall thickening at the rectum and sigmoid, with no
significant fat stranding, this finding could suggest colitis in
the appropriate clinical setting. Correlate with clinical
symptoms. 6. Compression fracture of vertebral body of T8 of
indeterminate age, correlate with point tenderness. Loss of
height of vertebral body of L5 of indeterminate age. 7.
Bilateral inguinal hernia, with fluid on the right.
-[**2121-9-16**] EEG: These findings suggest a moderate to severe
encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the
most
common causes. There were no epileptiform features or
electrographic
seizures. This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
-[**2121-9-16**] Renal US: IMPRESSION: 1. No hydronephrosis of left or
right kidney. 2. A few small cysts are seen in both kidneys. 3.
A small amount of free fluid is seen in the upper abdomen. 4.
Bilateral pleural effusions,
-[**2121-9-18**] MRI head: 1. No findings to explain patient's symptoms.
Chronic small vessel ischemic changes and cerebral atrophy.
2. No evidence of acute infarct. 3. Left cerebellopontine angle
isointense lesion measuring less than 1 cm, may represent
extension of the left cerebellar flocculus or soft tissue
lesion. Dedicated skull base pre-and post-contrast MR imaging is
recommended on a nonurgent basis for further evaluation. This
lesion is stable when compared to [**2119**].
[**2121-9-16**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
posterior pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
.
[**10-8**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large bilateral pleural effusions, worse than before with
associated
compressive atelectasis, diffuse soft tissue anasarca, and trace
perihepatic
free fluid, may reflect third spacing.
2. Multiple bilateral renal cysts, largest in the superior pole
of the right
kidney, incompletely characterized in the non-contrast setting.
3. T11 and T8 compression fractures may relate to underlying
multiple
myeloma, unchanged since the recent prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
This was a 75-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of
multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
hypothyroidism who presented with altered mental status and
subsequently developed A. fib w/ RVR, ARF, thrombocytopenia,
anemia, C.diff, and MRSA in his sputum.  He passed away on [**10-12**]
due to complications from these multiple medical conditions.
.
#CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS:  Unclear etiology for altered mental
status but possibilities include infection or neurologic
catastrophe such as hypoxic brain injury or multiple old
strokes.  MRI, LP, and EEG were all negative for causative
pathology.  Neurology was consulted and had no additional
work-up or treatment to recommend. The patient was started on
carbidopa/levidopa for ridigity and presumed Parkinson's.
Patient was kept comfortable and an effort was made to verbally
orient him at the bedside.  He was able to respond to his name
(by moving his eyes) but remained non-verbal toward the end of
hospital admission.
.
#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RVR: The patient developed A. fib with
RVR and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initation of rate
control. He was started on metoprolol, which was later changed
to diltiazem.  He acheived good rate control on diltiazem.
.
#PEA ARREST:  Patient went into cardiac (PEA) arrest on [**9-20**] and
was resuscitated at the bedside.  He was intubated and
transferred to the ICU.  He was stabilized and extubated without
complication.  Diltiazem was restarted.  Cardiac enzymes were
negative and echo showed mildly enlarged left atrium with
hyperdynami
