Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Heart Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
80F history of HTN, PAD presenting from [**Hospital3 **] with an
elevated troponin and chest pain. Patient awoke this morning at
around 4am with epigastric pain and jaw pain, nausea, and felt
tired and weak. Patient was evaluated at [**Hospital1 **] and trop I was
found to be 41. Patient received GI cocktail, aspirin, morphine,
SL nitroglycerin, atropine for bradycardia, Zofran, and heparin
bolus and drip and was transferred for further evaluation.
Patient denies any prior similar episodes.

In the ED, initial vitals were 42, 99/60, 18, 94% 4L.  ECG
showed ST elevations in II, III, avF, V2, and V3 with q waves in
III and avF,  and bradycardia with suspected atrial
fibrillation.  Code STEMI was called.  Received fentanyl,
Zofran, and atropine.  CXR (my read) showed probable
cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions.  Labs significant
for WBC 11.9, trop 3.46.  Vitals on transfer to cath lab were
40, 87/40, 18, 99%.

In the cardiac cath lab, patient was found to have total
occlusion of the proximal RCA, which was opened with balloon
angioplasty and then stented with a BMS to the proximal RCA
lesion.  A second BMS was placed in the mid-RCA and flow to the
distal RCA was restored.  A small dose of intra-arterial
Integrilin was injected, as was intra-arterial nitroglycerin.
Temporary pacer was placed in the cath lab, but removed prior to
coming to the floor.

On arrival to the floor, patient complained of epigastric pain
and discomfort in her legs.  She was responsive and oriented x
3.  She was on dopamine at 10 with HR 80 and BP 91/44.

STUDIES:
([**8-7**]) Cath -
1) Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right sided
pressures
in the setting of an inferior STEMI. PCWP was also found to
elevated
with mean 22. RV pressures were not measured as temporarily V
paced.
2) Selective coronary angiography of this rigth dominant system
revealed angiographically-apparent flow limiting stenosis in a
single
vessel. The LMCA was normal. The LAD was normal and patent. Lcx
was
patent. The RCA was totally occluded with some L->R collaterals.

3) Central aortic pressure was normal while on dopamine gtt.
4) Successful aspiration, thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the

proximal RCA with a 3.0 x 12 mm Integrity BMS postdilated to 3.5
mm (see
PTCA comments).
5) Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with a 3.0 x 18
mm
Integrity BMS (see PTCA comments).
6) Successful RFA AngioSeal (see PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Inferior STEMI with RV involvement on EKG associated with
hypotension
and bradycardia with angiography revealing totally occluded RCA.

2. Pacemaker discontinued after observation rates >70/min in
atrial
fibrillation.
3. Successful PCi of the proximal RCA with a 3.0 x 12 mm
Integrity BMS
postdilated to 3.5 mm.
4. Successful PCI of the mid RCA with a 3.0 x 18 mm Integrity
BMS.
5. Successful RFA AngioSeal.


Brief Hospital Course:
80F history of HTN, arrythmia, PAD presented to OSH with ~16
hours of chest pain, found to have elevated troponin and EKG
suggestive of inferior MI, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  At [**Hospital1 18**], she went to the cath lab, where she had
BMS to RCA x2 with restoration of flow.
.
# INFERIOR STEMI: Cath showed total occlusion of proximal RCA.
Two BMS were placed in the proximal and mid RCA with restoration
of flow.  (The LMCA was normal. The LAD was normal and patent.
Lcx was patent.) Pt was started on medical management with
Plavix 75 mg daily, aspirin 325 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg
daily. Echo was done in the morning that showed depressed RV
function. Beta blocker, verapamil, spironolactone and ACEI were
held given low blood pressure and RV infarction. Enzymes were
trended and MB peaked at 215 in the morning (troponin peaked at
7.68). AM CXR was benign with no s/s of overload. On [**8-8**] AM pt
continued to have [**2-27**] substernal chest pain, without radiation.
MAPs also dropped to 50s, and she was bradycardic, so we
increased her dopamine drip to 10; norepinephrine was added, as
was aminophylline 150mg/day (only one dose was given). Pt also
received 500 mL bolus NS which increased CVP from 10 to 16. The
patient's sinus node seemed to recover on [**9-21**], as she went
back into sinus rhythm without bradycardia, and this improved
her hemodynamics considerably. Pressors were weaned. She was
started on lisinopril.  Metoprolol can be considered as an
outpatient.
.
# PUMP: Post-cath ECHO showed significant depression of RV
function and PCWP of 22.  CVP on morning of [**8-8**] was 10. Patient
required 500mL bolus as her MAP was in the 50s [**8-8**] AM, CVP
found to be 16 after bolus, with MAP in 60s.  Patient was
started on Lasix 20mg PO daily prior to discharge.  She was
euvolumic on discharge.
.
# RHYTHM: On presentation, pt had bradycardia and an irregular
rhythm suggestive of atrial fibrillation with bradycardia.
After revascularization and removal of the temporary pacemaker,
rhythm was sinus initially, but she did go back into atrial
fibrillation over the next 24 hours. Pt was monitored on
telemetry, and her HR and BP remained low post procedure (50s,
MAP 50s-60s). She required BP support with dopamine an
