Tape / Integrilin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
Aortic Valvuloplasty

History of Present Illness:
80 M with h/o CAD s/p CABG and PCI, severe AS, CHF and
interstitial lung dz presumed from methyltrexate for polymycitis
who presents upon transfer from MVH with decompensated
congestive heart failure. As per outside records and report;
patient came to ED after one day history of difficulty breathing
requiring him to sleep bolt upright. He was found to be in
pulmonary edema by x-ray and with a corresponding BNP 2280. He
was given a total of 80mg of Lasix and sent to ICU for closer
management. Diuresed aggresively but overnight he became
hypotensive requiring fluids and started on Dopamine but was
unable to tolerate due to ventricular irritability so he was
placed on a neo gtt. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Upon transfer: Pt initially SOB now in CCU feels more
comfortable. Denies chest pain. As per OSH note, Pt endorses
several weeks most pronounced the last few days of worsening SOB
and orthopnea. Describes slightly worsened pedal edema.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.
Dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea as
per HPI. Denies any palpitations, syncope or presyncope


Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
OSH:  His WBC is 15.8 and his Bun/ct was 50/1.9 his BNP is 2600
today.  He was said to have some ST depressions last evening and
his troponin was 1.01.  His 2nd and 3rd troponins were 0.77 and
0.79 respectively.

Echocardiogram [**2164-4-4**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left  ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (EF 15-30%) with global hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Left
ventricular thrombus cannot be excluded. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is probably moderate to severe aortic
stenosis (although data for valve area calculation is
technically suboptimal). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2164-4-9**] demonstrated:
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system

revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was a
short
vessel without significiant disease.  The LAD had an ostial 60%
lesion
that was unchanged from [**2163**].  The distal vessel fills via the
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] and
via the native circulation.  The LCx was a nondominant vessel
without
critical lesions.  The previously placed LCx stents were widely
patent.
The RC was a dominant vessel with widely patent stents.
2.  Arterial conduit angiography revealed a small but patent
LIMA that
filled the LAD.  The SVG-RCA was totally occluded; the
previously
placed amplatz device was seen in the graft.  The SVG-OM was
occluded in
the mid segment.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
4.  Limited hemodynamics were performed.  The previously placed
pulmonary artery catheter in the right internal jugular vein was
used to
measure right sided pressures (only PCW and PA).  The pulmonary
artery
pressure was elevated at 40/20 mmHg.  The pulmonary capilary
wedge
pressure was elevated at 30mmHg.  Left ventricular end diastolic

pressure was 33 mmHg.  Central aortic pressure was 90/60 mmHg
with a
mean of 77 mmHg.  There was a mean gradient of 28 mmHg across
the aortic
valve.  Cardiac output was 3.53 l/min/m2.  The aortic valve area
was
calculated to be 0.6 cm2
.
CARDIAC CATH w AORTIC VALVULOPLASTY [**2164-4-10**]:
Initial hemodynamics revealed a peak aortic gradient of 19mmHg,
with
a valve area of 0.62cm2 and cardiac index of 1.7l/min/m2.  After
several
inflations with a 20mm balloon, the gradient decreased to 13mmHg
and the
valve area increased to 0.8cm2.  The cardiac index was
relatively
unchanged at 1.8l/min/m2.  There was a 10-15mmHg increase in the

systolic arterial pressure after the procedure.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe aortic stenosis.
3. Successful aortic valvuloplasty.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, 80 yo M with significant CAD, CHF and AS
presented with shortness of breath and decompensated heart
failure complicated by hypotension.  On initial presentation,
plan was for him to go for AVR but he was persistently
hypotensive in cardiogenic shock, complicated by sepsis.  After
a prolonged course, his family decided to make him CMO and he
passed away quickly after we stopped pressors.
.
Hospital course complicated by:
.
# Hypotension: initially cardiogenic, but also likley in septic
shock by the end
- used neosyn, dobutamine, and vasopressin
.
# Respiratory: SOB likely [**3-9**] to both volume overload and
pneumonia.
- cont vanco/zosyn, added flagyl
- lasix gtt; goal to improve respiratory status
- Supplemental O2
- nebs prn
.
# Renal: decreasing urine op, increasing cr; likely secondary to
ischemia/ATN.
- continue to diurese as tol by bp
- monitor renal function
- renally dose meds
.
# Ischemia: documented CAD and NSTEMI in setting of demand
ischemia and worsening systolic function (EF 15-20%).
- cath revealed coronaries unchanged from prior cath
- ASA
- currently on pressers, so no BB
- statin
.
# Pump: previous [**Month/Day (2) **] with EF50% now with significant worsening
of systolic function of unclear etiology probable wo
