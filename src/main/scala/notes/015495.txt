HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year-old
Spanish speaking man with a known history of CAD, never
revascularized, recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] for chemical cardioversion due to
atrial fibrillation and home sotalol, followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 284**] of the electrophysiology service.  On [**12-17**] he was at home with friends when he had an acute loss of
consciousness with question of seizure activity.  EMS was
called.  The patient had an O2 saturation in the 80s when
they arrived, with a heart rate in the 130s, atrial
fibrillation at that time and blood pressure with a systolic
of 200.  The patient was intubated.  Once he arrived in the
Emergency Room he had a neurological workup with a CT scan
that was negative for an acute bleed, and an event that was
felt to be not likely neurological in nature.  The patient
had no MI at that time, his enzymes were negative, and he was
being worked up for an electrophysiology study with a
probable ablation plus or minus a pacemaker, however, it was
felt that prior to that procedure he should have a cardiac
catheterization.  He underwent cardiac catheterization on the
[**12-22**].  Catheterization showed 70 percent left
main, 30 percent proximal LAD with 70 percent diagonal, 80
percent ostial circumflex, and 40 percent RCA with 100
percent PDA and an EF of 50 percent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for CAD, congestive heart
failure, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation,
atrial fibrillation, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine 1.5 to
1.7, and left lower extremity cellulitis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for AAA repair in [**2108**]
with a redo in [**2109**] and a thoracic aortic aneurysm repair
done in [**2108**].

He is allergic to amiodarone.

MEDS AT HOME:  Glucotrol 10 b.i.d., Lipitor 40 every day,
Cozaar 25 b.i.d., [**Doctor First Name **], aspirin 325 every day, Lasix 20
every day, Avandia (no dose specified), Aldactone 12.5 every
day, sotalol 40 b.i.d., and Toprol 200 every day as well as
Celexa every day 20 and Coumadin (no dose given).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives in [**Location (un) 538**].  He is
currently retired, was an independent truck driver.  Tobacco
remote history, quit over 10 years ago.  Alcohol use is rare.

Following cardiac catheterization cardiothoracic surgery was
consulted.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  At the time of consult height was 5 feet 8
inches, weight 180, heart rate 65 atrial fibrillation, blood
pressure 141/73, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 99
percent on two liters.  In general lying flat in bed in no
acute distress.  Neurologically alert and oriented x3,
appropriate with limited English.  Respiratory showed
bilateral crackles in the bases, left greater than right.
Cardiovascular irregular with frequent PACs, a II/VI systolic
ejection murmur.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Neck is supple with no carotid
bruits.  Extremities warm and well perfused with 1 plus edema
and bilateral varicosities.  Pulses showed radial 2 plus on
the right, 1 plus on the left, dorsalis pedis 2 plus
bilaterally.  Posterior tibial two plus bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7.1, hematocrit 30.7, platelets
337,000.  PT 14.3, PTT 35.1, INR 1.3.  Sodium 137, potassium
3.6, chloride 101, CO2 30, BUN 31, creatinine 1.4, glucose
195, ALT 12, AST 12, alkaline phosphatase 54, amylase 34,
total bilirubin 0.6, albumin 3.4.  UA was negative.  Stress
test done on [**11-24**] showed moderate reversible inferior
lateral defect and an echo done on [**12-28**] showed an EF
of 50 percent with 3 plus MR and 2 plus TR.  Chest x-ray at
the time of admission showed mild pulmonary edema.

Following consult the patient underwent vein mapping as well
as carotid ultrasound.  Carotid ultrasound showed no
significant stenosis on either side.

The patient continued to be followed by the medical service
until [**12-24**] when he was brought to the Operating Room
for coronary artery bypass grafting.  Please see the OR
report for full details.  In summary, the patient had a CABG
times four with a LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to
diagonal, saphenous vein graft to ramus, and saphenous vein
graft to the RPL.  His bypass time was 89 minutes with a
cross clamp time of 76 minutes.  He tolerated the operation
well and was transferred from the Operating Room to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer
the patient was AV paced with a mean arterial pressure of 68
and a CVP of 90.  He had Levophed at 0.04 mcg per kilogram
per minute, insulin at 2 units per hour and propofol at 25
mcg per kilogram per minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
His anesthesia was reversed.  He was successfully weaned from
the ventilator and ultimately extubated during the course of
the operative day.

On postoperative day one the patient remained hemodynamically
stable, continuing to require smaller amounts of Levophed to
maintain an adequate blood pressure.  His insulin drip was
weaned off and he was started back on a sliding scale insulin
as well as his oral hyperglycemics, however, he was kept in
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit for close pulmonary as
well as hemodynamic monitoring.

On postoperative day two the patient was noted to be mildly
confused.  He was also noted to have periods of atrial
fibrillation with a ventricular response rate to the 130s.
At those times he was also noted to be hypertensive.  He was
initially treated with Beta blockade and ultimately his
sotalol was instituted.

On postoperative day three the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable.  He was weaned from his Levophed
infusion.  He was, however, still in the ICU because of
confusion with some combativeness, and he was noted to have
short bursts of SVT versus VT rhythm.  Electrophysiology was
reconsulted at that time.  On the [**2117-12-18**] he was brought to
the electrophysiology lab for ablation plus or minus
pacemaker placement.  Ultimately, the patient did have a
permanent pacemaker implanted.  Please see the  EP procedure
note for full details.  Following pacemaker placement he was
returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day five the patient's neurological status
was noted to be less confused, however, at night he became
increasingly combative and hypertensive.  He was started on a
nitroglycerin drip at that time.  He was also started on
Coumadin following his permanent pacemaker placement.

On postoperative day six the patient's neurological status
had greatly improved, with no further episodes of agitation
or confusion.  He was transferred to ________ for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next several days the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  His activity level was advanced with
the assistance of the nursing staff as well as physical
therapy staff.  His antihypertensives were adjusted and on
postoperative day 10 it was decided that he was stable and
ready to be discharged to home.

At the time of this dictation the patient's physical exam is
as follows:  Temperature 97, heart rate 75 AV paced, blood
pressure 139/74, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 96
percent on room air.  Weight is 82 kg, on admission was 250
pounds.  Laboratory data shows PT is 19.5, INR is 2.4.  On
physical exam neuro is alert and oriented, moves all
extremities, follows commands, nonfocal exam.  Pulmonary
shows clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac shows
regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2.  Incision healing well,
clean and dry.  Sternum is stable without any erythema or
drainage.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused with no edema.  Left leg incision with Steri Strips
open to air, clean and dry.

Patient's condition at time of discharge is good.  He is to
be discharged home with visiting nurses.
