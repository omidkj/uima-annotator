Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2132-8-4**]: Flexible cystodcopy, wire & catheter placed by Urology
(now out)


History of Present Illness:
This is a 89 year-old male [**Location 7972**] male with a history of
asthma who presents with chest tightness and difficulty taking a
deep breath since 9 PM on the evening prior to admission.
Patient denies any fevers, chills or cough. He denies any
nausea, diaphoresis, vomitting or abdominal pain. The chest
tightness improved in a span of [**1-27**] hours, after patient
received treatment in ED. However, the patient did have some
tachypnea in the ED, and was admitted to MICU for further
observation of respiratory status. Otherwise, patient was
currently without any complaints, and denies current shortness
of breath. Denies any sick contacts.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T:98, HR:96, BP:154/96, RR:34,
O2Sat: 100% on RA. He received albuterol and ipratropium
nebulizers and 125mg IV methylprednisolone, with improvement of
his symptoms. Given leukocytosis and possible infiltrate on
chest x-ray, he was also started on cefriaxone and azithromycin
for pneumonia.

IMAGING:
=======
[**2132-8-6**] Cardiac Echo (TTE) - The left atrium is elongated.
The left atrial volume is increased. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
[**Year (4 digits) 1192**] pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2130-5-15**], the findings are similar. The prior echo
assessed aortic valve area as 1.2cm2, however, this should have
been 1.8-1.9cm2.
.
[**2132-8-5**] RENAL U.S. - FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 13.5
cm and the left 12.0 cm. The renal parenchymal thickness and
echogenicity are normal without evidence of calculi or
hydronephrosis. The right kidney demonstrates a small cyst in
the upper pole measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm. Within the
interpolar region of the left kidney, there is a 1.1 x 0.9 x 1.1
cm cyst. The bladder is not fully distended. IMPRESSION: 1. No
evidence of hydronephrosis, renal calculi, or solid masses; 2.
Bilateral small renal cysts.
.
[**2132-8-4**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - FINDINGS: There is elevation of the
left hemidiaphragm with left pleural thickening. There has been
interval decrease in pulmonary interstitial markings when
compared to prior exam. However, more confluent opacities in the
right perihilar region are noted, which may represent
atelectasis. A more nodular density measuring approximately 1 cm
is noted in the right lung base which was not seen on prior exam
and may represent the nipple. IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in
interstitial pulmonary markings. Interval development of right
basilar atelectasis. Right lung nodular opacity may represent
nipple. Repeat study is recommended with nipple markers.
.
EKG:
===
[**2132-8-4**] - Sinus rhythm with atrial premature complexes;
Consider left atrial abnormality; Modest nonspecific ST-T wave
changes; Since previous tracing of [**2132-8-3**], no significant
change. QT/QTc 380/430.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Chest tightness/SOB: Given his leukocytosis (14.3), and ? of
LLL infiltrate on CXR, the patient was initially treated as
asthma exacerbation precipitated by pneumonia. He was given
Prednisone, cefpodoxime and azithromycin. On HD2 the patient was
clinically improved, denied SOB and was weaned off O2. During
his stay the patient remained without wheezes on exam and it was
noted that LLL opacity was unchanged from prior x-ray several
years ago.  He denied taking advair at home and denied history
of asthma.  He was also ruled out for MI w/EKGs and cardiac
enzymes.  He was discovered to have a history of esophageal
spasm and this was felt to be a more likely explanation for the
chest tightness.  GI was consulted and recommended evaluation as
an outpatient.  His antibiotics were D/C'd on hospital day 2.
THe patient received 4 days of steroids (Solumedrol 125 mg IV
x's 1 on [**8-4**] in ED; Prednisone 60 mg PO x's 1 on [**8-5**] in ICU;
Prednisone 40 mg PO QD x's 2 on floor. He NOT discharged on
Prednisone. He was also started on a baby aspirin.  Outpatient
PFTs have been scheduled for the patient. Omeprazole 20 mg
Capsule, Delayed Release was started for GERD/Hiatal
hernia/Asthma.
