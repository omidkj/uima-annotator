none

History of Present Illness:
89 yo female with h/o stroke, DM2, GERD, GOUT, recently
([**2028-1-4**]) admitted w/ new onset atrial flutter (shocked w/ no
effect but converted w/ volume resuscitation) presenting today
with continual fatigue and was noted by PT at rehabe to be
tachycardic. Because of this, she was taken to the ED at her
request.
She reports that she felt fatigued ever since being admitted at
[**Hospital1 18**] this past [**Month (only) **]. With this recent episode, she denies
any CP, SOB, palpitations, dizziness, n/v. She reports poor PO
intake at rehab [**3-16**] "unpallatable foods". She denies any
productive cough, but reports an onset of recent "cold" w/o
coryza, sore throat. She also denies melena, BRBPR, abdominal
pain. During recent admission had been r/o for ruled out for
other etiology including PE (neg CTA), ischemia (CE negative
x3), and sepsis (blood cultures NG).
.
She was also seen in ED on [**1-14**] w/ sx of acute anxiety, nausea,
feeling of doom. Had a NSR ECG unchaged from d/c, received doses
of vanco/levofloxacin for suspected PNA and was discharged back
to rehabilitation facility.
.
On review of systems, she denies fevers/chills, N/V, abdominal
pain, palpitations, dysuria or frequency. Denies PND or
orthopnea.
.
In the ED VS were 97.6F, HR 140, 110/74, 23, 91-95% on 4L.
Patient received 1L NS, followed by 10mg Diltiazem IV, w/
subsequent hypotension to 88/59. Pt. then received additional 4L

1 amp of CaGluconate for Ca of 5.9 and K of 3.2.
.
DNR/DNI per d/w daughter Dr. [**Known lastname **], ok for cardioversion,
but no central line, no pressors.

Imaging/Studies:

CXR - Vascular engorgement bridging on mild pulmonary edema has
developed since
[**1-14**], small right pleural effusion and moderate-to-severe
cardiomegaly
are unchanged. No pneumothorax. Severe erosive degenerative
changes noted in
the left shoulder. No pneumothorax. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5621**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**] paged
to report
these findings, at the time of dictation.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo F with PMH of DM2, diastolic CHF, aflutter, gout and
presented with continued fatigue and tachycardia noted by PT at
rehab.

1. RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation, reccurent. Pt is s/p failed
cardioversion (x2), w/ hx of reversion to SR spontaneously.  Pt.
did not respond to diltiazem. Clearly was not responding in
terms of arrhythmia to volume resuscitation. The cause of afib
was unclear, but likely [**3-16**] structural disease w/ [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 13385**]
as well as age.  No pulm or infectious causes were evident on
hx, labs or CXR. Pt. may have become tachy [**3-16**] volume depletion
(poor PO intake). In addition, pt. was volume overloaded on
admission.  Per previous OMR d/c summary, she was poor candidate
for anticoagulation with coumadin and patient and daughter were
in agreement of not anticoagulating. Per discussion w/ daughter,
comfort is the goal of care at this point.

Patient was monitored on telemetry.  She was started on
Amiodarone IV w/ initial bolus, and then 1g/hr infusion.  She
converted to sinus rhythm approximately 2hrs after starting
amiodarone and remained in sinus until discharge.  Once IV
amiodarone regimen  was completed, she was started on 400 mg PO
amiodarone which will be continued for one week, with decrease
to 200mg daily thereafter.  Metoprolol was started, replacing
prior diltiazem.

2. PUMP. Diastolic CHF, most recent echo w/ LVEF > 65%,
symmetric LVH and elevated PAP. On lasix 80mg QD at rehab.
Currently volume overloaded on exam, but will hold diuresis
given recent hx of hypotension are 5L IVF resuscitation in ED.
Pt. likely requiring this given loss of atrial kick and impaired
relaxation.  The Lasix was held until until pt. converted to
sinus rhythm, given recent hypotension.  Patient's pulmonary
edema improved significantly on exam after converting to sinus.
Lasix was restarted at discharge.

3. CORONARIES. CAD documented on previous D/C summaries. No
documentation of coronary anatomy in OMR. Pt. w/o anginal sx
currently but had SOB as anginal equivalent. No lipid panel in
OMR. Will discuss w/ PCP the utility of assessing further, given
goals of care.  Continued ASA.

4. Abnormal CXR. Opacities b/l. No clinical sings of PNA, no
fever, WBC count, productive cough. Likely resolving infiltrates
from prior PNA.  There was no indication for ABx and patient's
fever curve and WBCs remained wnl.

5. Diabetes type 2 with complications.  Oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was held and
Humalog insulin SS was used to control hyperglycemia.

6. Gout.  Inactive during admission.  Continued allopurinol and
colchicine, per home regimen.

7. Osteoporosis: continued calcium, vitamin D and Fosamax.
