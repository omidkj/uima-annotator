History of Present Illness:
70yo M with h/o CKD stage V, obesity, PVD (s/p right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **]
bypass), HTN, HLD and BPH presented originally for worsening
somnolence and confusion.  Patient has been preparing to
initiate HD and is being evaluated for a transplant.  He has an
AVG placed 5 months prior, but it has not matured.  The patients
family was concerned about his worsening mental status,
prompting their visit to the ED.  In the ED, the patient was
noted to be SOB and confused.  His troponins were elevated but
he was not felt to have ischemic EKG changes.  He was admitted
to the MICU out of concern for volume overload and possible need
for urgent HD.

The dialysis team evaluated the patient and felt that HD was not
needed urgently.  The MICU evaluated him for possible infectious
etiology.  The patient was not reporting sx or febrile, but
given his overall status, he was was started on CTX/levo for
?PNA given the concerning findings on his CXR.  He was also
noted to be in afib, which is believed to be a new finding for
the patient.  The patient was started on heparin gtt and has
been rate controlled on his own.

He was eventually started on HD (day 1: [**2195-11-2**]) via a tunneled
line.  Following his first session, his mental status began to
improve.  He is currently mentating well and has remained
afebrile and HD stable.  He is to be transferred to the fluid
for further management.  Currently, the patient reports feeling
well.  He is tired but has no other compliants.  He is preparing
for his second HD today.

Studies-
-pCXR ([**2195-10-31**]):  AP portable chest radiograph.  Exam is limated
by portable technique, low lung volumes and body habitus.  There
is apparent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Bibasilar
opacities may be due to atelectasis and overlying soft tissues
with small efusions not excluded.  The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is prominent but likely accentuated for reason above.
 Old, potentially post traumatic changes seen at the lateral
right clavicle.

-NCHCT ([**2195-11-4**]): No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or
acute infarction.

-CXR ([**2195-11-4**]): Moderate right pleural effusion accounts for
most of the radiodensity at the base of the right hemithorax.
Pulmonary edema, if present, is minimal.  Caliber of the upper
mediastinum has not changed since [**10-31**] and could be due
either to mediastinal fat deposition or dilated mediastinal
veins.  The heart is top normal size, exaggerated by mediastinal
fat.

-AV Fistulogram ([**2195-11-5**]): Preliminary Report
Left AV fistulagram demonstrating :
1. Multiple early filling collateral venous pathways between the
cephalic vein and the basilic vein.
2. Two foci of possible minimal bandlike stenosis (<15%) in the
cephalic vein at the level of the femoral head of uncertain
hemodynamic significance.
3. Variant anatomy with bifurcation of the cephalic vein 6cm
proximal to its junction with the subclavian vein. Again this
may be contributing to mild flow limitation.
4. The central veins appear to be widely patent.
5. Widely patent arterial anastamosis on ultrasound.
The above findings would be amenable to percutaneous venoplasty
to see if this reduces flow into the cephalic to basilic
collaterals.
