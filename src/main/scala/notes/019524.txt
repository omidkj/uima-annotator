Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
DIAGNOSIS: Acute myeloid leukemia, myelomonocytic
differentiation with inversion 16. Treated w/ C2D1 High dose
Cytarabine pmn [**12-21**]. The patient presented with three weeks of
fatigue, sore throat, preauricular pain and two days of a
headache on [**2127-10-9**]. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood
cell count of 57,000 with 30% others, hematocrit of 36.1, and
platelet count of 54,000. He underwent a bone marrow aspirate
and biopsy and pathology demonstrated acute myelogenous leukemia
with myelomonocytic differentiation that was positive for the
inversion 16 mutation. He initiated therapy with standard 7+3
including Daunorubicin at 90 mg/m2 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2. His
course was complicated by pulmonary edema during induction
requiring ICU transfer, febrile neutropenia and respiratory
bronchiolitis. He was discharged from the hospital on day +30
bone marrow was without leukemia. He began postremission therapy
with high dose cytarabine on [**2127-11-17**]. Cycle 1 was complicated
by fever/neutropenia requiring admission. On [**12-14**] he had
dendritic cell collection (vaccine trial protocol #09-412).
Cycle 2 ([**Date range (1) 27630**]) was uncomplicated, as was Cycle 3 (D1 was
[**2128-1-26**]).

IMAGING:
[**2128-3-10**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.
.
[**2128-3-11**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to
moderately depressed (LVEF=40-45%) with mild global hypokinesis
(and inferior near akinesis). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is borderline
pulmonary ar
