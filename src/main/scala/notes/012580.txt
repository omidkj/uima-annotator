Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization without stent placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year-old male with a history of CHF EF 20-25% and
mod/severe MR / severe TR who presents with fever (he had not
measured his temp but felt fevers / chills) fatigue and
diarrhea. In addition he states he has been having relatively
continuous sharp abdominal pain, worse w/ exertion below his
umbilicus. He says the fevers and this pain have been going on
for 1 day however he had similar symptoms of abdominal pain on
his admission in the beginning of [**Month (only) 462**] although these
symptoms were RUQ exertional pain. He states that he has felt
unwell since he began taking a new medication that his doctor
prescribed. His most recent new medication was the addition of
toprol xl 100mg daily and stopping carvedilol 3.125mg po bid.
This change was made on [**2187-8-28**]. He states he began taking a new
medication just prior to his symptoms beginning but is unable to
clarify which medication this was. He denies any worsening DOE,
he has stable 1 block DOE, 1 pillow orthopnea which is improved
from his previous admission during which he had 3 pillow
orthopnea. No increase in pedal edema. No cough, no dysuria. Has
chronic constipation but has had 4-5 episodes of watery diarrhea
over the past 24 hours, this is new. No pain with bowel
movements. No lightheadedness. also, complained of fatigue.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 102.1, 90, 86/51, 96% NRB. He had a
cxr and ua that were negative. CT abdomen did not show any
intrabdominal process. Patient was guaiac negative but prostate
exam was reportedly very tender. He received 4 liters NS in the
ED. He has 2 large bore IVs. After IV NS, patient's bp improved
to 100/54 (baseline bp 130s).

Of note, he was recently hosp here [**8-6**] and diagnosed with new
onset cardiomyopathy. His cardiomyopathy was ultimately thought
to be
secondary to viral myocarditis, as his history was consistent
with this, and other etiologies for dilated cardiomyopathy,
including hemochromatosis, HIV, and doxorubicin exposure, were
excluded. He was diuresed and his symptoms improved.


Past Medical History:
Cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology, EF 20-25%

Social History:
Patient moved from [**Location (un) 41654**] to [**Location (un) 86**] 4 years ago. He works as a
cook in a restaurant. He lives with multiple family members. [**Name (NI) **]
has no current sexual partner, but has been with women int he
past. No tobacco, occasional alcohol, no illicit drugs.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO: [**9-6**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. A secundum type atrial septal defect is
present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2187-7-31**], the mitral regurgitation is further
increased.

CXR: IMPRESSION: Marked cardiomegaly, without evidence of CHF or
pneumonia.

CT abd / pelvis w/ contrast [**2187-9-6**]: No CT findings to explain
patient's symptoms. Marked cardiomegaly. L1 compression
deformity of unknown chronicity.

C. Cath [**9-11**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are free of angiographically significant
disease.
2. Normal right and left heart filling pressures.

Echo [**9-13**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular outflow
tract is dilated. with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2187-9-6**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
increased, and the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation is
reduced.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 52 year old male with a history of dilated
cardiomyopathy with who presents with fever and abdominal pain.


1. Hypotension: Patient presented febrile with leukocytosis,
elevated respiratory rate of roughly 20 and hypotension. Lactate
was slightly elevated but improved with fluids. CXR did not show
evidence of infiltrate. CT abdomen performed given diarrhea, but
did not reveal source of infection. His UA was negative x 2 and
subsequent urine cultures were negative x 3. Digital rectal exam
without tenderness. Received levo/ flagyl in ER for empiric
coverage. Vancomycin was added in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for gram positive
coverage. Unstable to send stool coverages as patient did not
have bowel movements during admission. Blood and urine cultures
were negative after 48 hours so antibiotics were discontinued.
Repeat UA was sent on morning of transfer and was notable for
new WBCs [**10-18**] and cipro was added for coverage of complicated
UTI. Patient remained afebrile with improvement in leukocytosis
at time of transfer to the floor.

While on the floor the patient experienced bouts of hypotension
as low as 78bpm.  His was bolused 250mL x4 and his target
systolic pressure based on heart function remained above 80mmHg.


2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: Patient with recent admission for
heart failure found to have a dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 25%
and 4+ TR/MR.  During this admission, a repeat T
