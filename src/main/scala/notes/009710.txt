Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year old
woman with a history of end stage liver disease secondary to
hepatitis C complicated by esophageal varices as well as a
history of encephalopathy and prior spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for
management of her ascites.  On that hospitalization multiple
attempts were made to manage her fluid overload with
diuretics, but she was ultimately refractory to them.  She
was referred for TIPS procedure for improved fluid
management.  The patient was readmitted on the day of
admission on [**4-7**] for TIPS.  The procedure was notable for
having somewhat difficult access, but no complications with
an estimated blood loss of 100 cc.  At the procedure she
received 4 mg of Versed, 600 of propofol, 150 of fentanyl.
She had been hemodynamically stable for several hours post
procedure, but then her blood pressure dropped from 100/40 to
70s to 80s over 30s and her heart rate remained sinus tach.
At the time, although her urine output remained strong, she
was transferred to the medical ICU for further management.

disability.  She is not married.  She lives with her son.
She has a 15 pack year tobacco history, she quit in [**Month (only) 359**].
She has a history of alcohol use, particularly heavy in the
mid-[**2109**].  She has a history of IV drug abuse, none since
the [**2109**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.  It does not include liver
disease or bleeding disorder.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature was 98.5,
pulse 96, BP 95/48, respiratory rate 16, sating 98 percent on
3 liters.  In general, she was a pleasant, middle aged woman
lying in no acute distress.  Head and neck exams showed
normocephalic, atraumatic head with pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Oropharynx was slightly dry.  On neck exam she had a
right central venous line with mild ooze.  Heart was
tachycardiac with regular rhythm, no murmurs.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.  Abdomen was
soft, nondistended, nontender with active bowel sounds.  She
had guaiac positive stool.  Extremities had 2+ edema to the
knees.  On neuro exam she was alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II-XII were grossly intact.  Strength and
sensation were grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 3.7, hematocrit 26.8, platelets
43.  PTT 39.5, INR 1.5.  Sodium 126, potassium 4.4, chloride
94, bicarb 26, BUN 31, creatinine 1.2, glucose 136.  Calcium
7.5, mag 1.2, phos 3.7.  AST 174, ALT 80, alka phos 126,
t-bili 3.1, LDH 255.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hypotension.  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
hypotension.  The underlying etiology was not initially
clear, although the differential included excess anesthesia
from the procedure, particularly given her liver disease
versus hypovolemia from a hemorrhage, either around the liver
into the abdomen or within the GI tract versus sepsis.  She
was started empirically on antibiotics with levo and Flagyl.
She had an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for ascites for
possible paracentesis.  There was no ascites.  She was
maintained on antibiotic prophylaxis for several days.  She
was transfused one unit of packed cells and given fluids to
improve her blood pressure and it responded appropriately.
She was started on Neo-Synephrine to keep her MAPS greater
than 55.  It took several days, but this was ultimately
weaned.  The entire time she had excellent urine output.  As
cultures continued to be negative and the patient had no
fever or white count, she was not maintained SBP antibiotic
coverage and once she was maintained on pressors, she was
able to be transferred out to the floor.  She had no further
evidence of hypotension while on the medicine floor.

2.  Hypoxia/congestive heart failure.  The patient was given
vigorous IV fluids hydration and blood during her MICU stay.
She subsequently became progressively hypoxic with diffuse
wheezing and a chest film that was consistent with fluid
overload.  She was started with diuresis once she was on the
medicine floor with rapid improvement in her hypoxia and her
lung exam.  Once the pulmonary edema was improved, her
exercise tolerance improved dramatically.

3.  Pulmonary.  The patient does have a history of asthma and
she was wheezing significantly when she hit the floor.  She
responded well to IV Lasix and frequent nebulizer treatments.
These will be continued as an outpatient per her
prehospitalization regimen.

4.  Status post TIPS.  The patient did not have any evidence
of encephalopathy and her abdominal distention improved
significantly over the course of her admission.  She was
between 2 and 3 liters negative per day and did not have an
untoward effects with respect to her renal failure.

5.  Renal.  The patient's creatinine slightly increased on
admission to the ICU.  However, over the course of her
admission, her creatinine went down to 1.0 by discharge which
is as good, if not better, than her typical baseline.

6.  Infectious disease.  When the patient was out on the
floor, she did not show any evidence of infection.  She was
continued on SBP prophylaxis regimen of Levaquin q.day.

7.  Endocrine.  The patient was continued on her diabetes
regimen with glargine and a sliding scale.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA for home safety
evaluation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  End stage liver disease.
2.  Hepatitis C.
3.  Anasarca.

1.  Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
2.  Albuterol one to two puffs q.six hours p.r.n.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient will call the liver center to make an
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in two weeks.  She will contact
