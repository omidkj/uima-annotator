Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was emergently taken by orthopedics to the operating
room for washout and repair of her L tib-fib fracture. The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the
floor postoperatively. On HD#3 she returned to the OR for
operative fixation of her R distal femur fracture. She tolerated
this procedure well, and was intubated on POD#[**3-8**] and returned
to the floor.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by a substantial
drop in her hematocrit on HD#2, POD#1. This anemia was
asymptomatic, and felt to be due to continued bleeding into her
R lower extremity as well as dilution from fluid resuscitation.
She was transfused 2U pRBCs preoperatively, 1U intraoperatively,
and 2U postoperatively. Her hematocrit improved and remained
stable after this, however, she was complaining of some chest
pain and dyspnea postoperatively. Cardiac enzymes were negative
x 2 and an EKG showed no acute ischemic changes. She was
diuresed with IV Lasix x 2, and her symptoms resolved well. She
was medically stable for discahrge to acute rehab by hospital
day #6.

Patient currently being treated for wound cellulitis RLE with 7
day course Keflex 500mg po QID. She will follow up with
Orthopedics in 2 weeks.
