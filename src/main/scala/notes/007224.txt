Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69 year old male with a history of DM, morbid
obesity, dyslipidemia, HTN, and ? CAD who presents with
complaints of shortness of breath to an OSH, now transfered to
the [**Hospital1 18**] with concerns of cardiogenic shock.
.
The patient reports a history of angial pain with activity in
the past, but has been asymptomatic for many years since being
started on his current medication regimen. He reports two prior
stress tests, the patient is unclear of the results. He reports
being able to do his ADLs, but can only walk 2 blocks, limited
by fatigue. However, on repeat questioning, reports episode
within the last month of experiencing substernal chest pain,
lasting many hours. Patient was hesitant to activate EMS, and
pain eventually went away.
.
Starting six months ago, the patient developed significant
orthopnea, has has to sleep sitting up in a chair. He has
baseline [**Last Name (LF) 39779**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] cannot comment regarding worsening LE
swelling. Since [**Holiday **], the patient has felt marked
dysnpnea, for which he saw his cardiologist. A TTE was
performed, which by report, is notably worse than one from 2
years prior, with an EF of 20%. The patient was supposed to see
his cardiologist in clinic the day of presentation, but felt too
dysnpnic to clean his car of [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he activated EMS, and was
brought to [**Hospital6 17032**] for further care.
.
At the OSH ED, the patient's vitas were HR 100, BP 106/38, and
99% on an unclear O2. The patient was noted to have a large left
pleural effusion, for which he underwent a thoracentesis, with
removal of 1 L liter serous fluid with protein count consistent
with an exudative process by lytes criteria. The patient was
believed to be in decompensated heart failure. He was given 60mg
of IV lasix. Initial cardiac markers showed a troponin I of
0.16, CK of 63. The patinet was given heparin, plavix, and IV
metoprolol. After receiving the BB and lasix, the patient had
worsening blood pressures in the 70s, and was started on
dobutamine per recommendations from cardiology, and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
On arrival, his HR was 115, BP of 80/50, and 94% on 6L NC. An
EKG was obtained that showed concerning inferior ST elevation
with reciprocal lateral changes. The patient was started on
integrillin.  His dobutamine was weened off, and pressures
improved.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Studies/Imaging:
.
Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia with a single ventricular
premature beat.
Low limb lead voltage. Intraventricular conduction delay.
Inferior ST segment
elevation with ST segment depression in leads I, aVL and
elevation in lead V1.
Consider inferior myocardial infarction. Q waves in leads V1-V3.
Consider
anterior wall myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Low
voltage,
particularly in the limb and lateral precordial leads. Clinical
correlation is
suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.

ECHO [**11-23**] - The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis, with near-akinesis of the inferior
wall (LVEF = 15-20%), most consistent with multivessel coronary
artery disease. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild gl
