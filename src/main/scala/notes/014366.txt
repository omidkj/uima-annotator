History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 47194**] is an 83 year old Italian speaking male with
multiple chronic medical problems, including AF on Coumadin,
CAD, COPD, and hx multiple exposures (+PPD, asbestos) who was
transferred to the MICU from the ED for managment of acute liver
failure.

The history was obtained from the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] signout, and limited
conversation with the patient. He was in his usual state of
health until about [**2192-7-20**], when he began to have nausea
without vomiting and soft stools. He had been to a birthday
celebration two days prior, where he had eaten Chinese food.
Nobody else from that party got sick. He went to his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
labs showed ALT 619, AST 249, AP 852, total bili 1.5, and INR
3.9. Hepatits C IgG was negative; Hep A IgM negative, IgG
positive; Hep B surface Ag neg, surf Ab pos, core IgM negative,
core IgG positive.

This week, the family noticed that the patient had turned
yellow.  He had repeat labs, which apparently showed an INR
around 10 and a Tbili also around 10. On Tuesday, three days
prior to admission, he stopped taking coumadin as instructed.

He does not have any acute complaints. He denies vomiting, but
endorses nausea. However, he was seen to have non-bloody emesis
in the ED. The family members did not think he was confused,
although he had been napping more than usual. He was evaluated
for increasing fatigue at his PCP's office in 6/[**2191**].

Workup in ED notable for RUQ US which showed dilated intra- and
extra-hepatic ducts, and a dilated GB.

In the ED, initial vitals were T:98.9, HR:64, BP:105/66, RR:18,
Sat 99% ra.
The patient looked comfortable, without encephalopathy, with
significant jaundice and icterus, irregular heart rate, belly
distended but soft/nontender, liver 7-8 cm below costal margin.
No ascites appreciated. EKG showed Afib 72, old rbbb, left axis
deviated.

No medications given in the ED, no fluids in the ED, liver
consult, ruq u/s showed "Marked intra and extrahepatic biliary
dilation of uncertain etiology. Pancreas not visualized. Dilated
gallbladder with no evidence of cholecystitis. MRCP/ cross
sectional imaging is recommended to evaluate etiology of biliary
dilation."
