Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
coma, glucose 22, seizure activity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 55-yo man, Type 1 Diabetic with frequent
hypoglycemic episodes, ERSD, and HTN, who was found unresponsive
in the waiting room at Josline Diabetes Center. He had a FSBS of
20 on the scene, and was given Glucagon and 1 amp of D50 without
effect on his mental status. He was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED,
where his FSBS was 150s-170s, but he remained unresponsive (GCS
3). He proceeded to develop seizure-like activity including
tonic movements of his abdominal muscles and limbs. Head CT at
the time was normal, and he was intubated for airway protection.
Labs revealed renal failure with Cr 5.5, hyperkalemia (K 6.2),
and negative serum and urine tox screens. Studies were otherwise
normal, including ECG, CXR, and UA. VS in the ED - afeb
(normothermic), BP 107/66, HR 55, O2-sat 100% on CMV -
500x14/5/100% FiO2. He is admitted to the ICU for further care.

In the ICU: Pt was found to be hypothermic to 93 F, with
continued seizure-like activity of the extremities. He was
placed on a bear-hugger, but he remained unresponsive to any
stimulation. Given his fluctuating neurological exam, the pt was
sent for a repeat Head CT, which was unchanged.

STUDIES:
Renal U/S: Mildly increased cortical echogenicity with no
hydronephrosis and no stones or solid masses

Noncon CTH: No evidence of swelling or infarction. If there is
concern for anoxic brain injury, MR is far more sensitive than
CT

EEG: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the very low voltage
background throughout the recording. This suggests a widespread
encephalopathy. Anoxia and medications are two of the most
common
explanations. There were no epileptiform features. The
persistent beta frequency activity suggests some influence of
medication.

CXR: ET tube positioned at/immediately above the carina.
Retraction by at least 3 cm is advised. NG tube in appropriate
position. No acute intrathoracic process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
type 1 diabetes, autoimmune antibodies to the insulin receptor,
ESRD, HTN, and CHF admitted for seizure secondary to
hypoglycemia with hospital course significant for MICU admission
with intubation for airway protection.

1. Diabetes Type 1 Uncontrolled with complications: Patient has
type 1 diabetes as well as insulin autoantibody that causes
frequent hypoglycemic episodes with multiple admissions for
similar presenting symptoms.  The patient had stable blood
glucose levels on his home regimen of lantus 3 units [**Hospital1 **] and
HISS ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]).  During the patient's hospitalization,
endocrinology and rheumatology were consulted regarding the
patient's condition.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] consultation recommendations,
insulin antibodies, as well as a SPEP and UPEP were sent off
during this admission and will be followed by the patient's
diabetologist.  On discharge, the patient was instructed to
continue his home regimen and a prescription for an emergency
glucagon kit was provided.  He was instructed to follow-up with
his endocrinologist at the [**Hospital **] Clinic as well as rheumatology
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20861**].

2. Seizures/Altered mental status:  The inciting event most
likely hypoglycemia, as the patient has multiple admissions with
similar presentations.  His altered mental status during his
initial presentation was likely multifactorial including post
ictal state, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and uremia.  The patient
did have a CT head that was unchanged and an EEG that
demonstrated encephalopathy.  Neurology was consulted during the
patient's admission.  On transfer to the general medicine floor,
the patient was mentating well without significant neurologic
abnormalities.  On discharge, he continued to mentate well
without signs of altered mental status.

3. Renal failure: The patient has baseline ESRD. He has been
followed by Dr.[**Name (NI) 4849**] at the [**Hospital **] Clinic, and also evaluated
by renal transplant.  During the patient's hospitalization, he
was started on nephrocaps, and renal was consulted with regard
to continuity on an outpatient basis. On discharge, the patient
was instructed to follow-up with Dr.[**Name (NI) 4849**] as well as renal
transplant clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**]

4. SPEP: On the day after discharge, the patient had a IgM
monoclonal spike on SPEP to 368.  The patient will require
referral to heme/onc for further evaluation and monitoring.

5. Prophylaxis: Patient was treated with heparin SQ during his
hospital admission for DVT prophylaxis.

6. Follow-up: The day after discharge, the patient was scheduled
with numerous follow-ups as stated below:

[**7-17**] at 11:30 AM: Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the [**Hospital **] Clinic
(Endocrinology).

Building, [**Location (un) 436**] (Renal [**Hospital 1326**] Clinic).

[**7-24**] at 1:30 PM: Dr.[**Name (NI) 4849**] at the [**Hospital **] Clinic
(Nephrology).

[**8-2**] at 11:20 AM: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP at [**Hospital6 2399**], [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Center [**Location (un) **], South suite
(Primary Care).
