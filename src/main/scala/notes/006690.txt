Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for NSTEMI, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
82M h/o HTN, chronic back pain presented at 10:30am to Dr. [**Name (NI) 21977**] office at [**Hospital6 2910**] complaining of
2 days chest congestion and nausea. He denied chest pain, but
for the chest congestion he had been using a heating pad with
some improvement allowing him to sleep. On further review, he
had been feeling somewhat unwell for 4-5 days with increased
DOE, easily fatiguable, and some breathlessness at rest noticed
by his wife. Denied orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema. Was
having nausea, dry heaves, and anorexia. The night prior to
presentation he developed fever to 101.6F, and was also
complaining of nasal congestion and cough. History is otherwise
per transfer notes and limited due to patient intubated and
sedated.
.
At the OSH, he remained chest pain free but was noted to have
new deep precordial T-wave inversions. Cardiac enzymes revealed
TnI 8.0 and CK 287. He was given ASA 325, beta-blocker, and
started on a heparin IV gtt with plans for medical management of
NSTEMI pending further clincial change. An echo showed mild
global HK and new depressed EF 35-40%.
.
The evening prior to transfer the patient became increasingly
dyspneic. CXR was consistent with acute pulmonary edema and he
was given IV nitro and lasix without significant improvement. He
was intubated and became hypotensive with SBP 70s. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further care.
.
On review of systems, per HPI and otherwise limited due to
intubation/sedation. According to OSH records, the patient
denied chills, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary frequency, or
dysuria at presentation.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable per HPI.

      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Radiology
============

CT chest [**6-24**]
Ground-glass opacities with central distribution, although more
prominent on the right than on the left, are most consistent
with pulmonary edema, with small right greater than left pleural
effusions. No definite infectious process seen, although
enhancement pattern of the pleural effusion cannot be assessed
without IV contrast.
.
RUQ U/s [**6-27**]
1. Diffusely echogenic liver, compatible with fatty
infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including

fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study. No focal
hepatic lesion.
2. No biliary ductal dilatation.
.
CT Torso [**6-27**]
1. Worsening bilateral pulmonary edema, although underlying
pneumonia remains an increasingly likely possibility given
persistent fevers.
2. Endotracheal tube tip is 1.5 cm above the carina
.
CT Chest [**7-3**]
1. Improved multifocal consolidations, no evidence of lung
abscess.
It is a combination of improved pulmonary edema and pneumonia.

2. Decrease in size of bilateral pleural effusions.

TTE [**6-21**]
Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is
mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with infero-lateral and apical hypokinesis suggested. No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion
.
C. cath [**2119-6-22**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
2. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
.
TTE [**6-28**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertroph
