Chief Complaint:
Liver failure

Central venous line placement
Dobhoff feeding tube placement
Swan ganz catheter placement
Hemodialysis line placement

Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
54M w/ liver failure, child C cirrhosis from EtOH and HCV p/w
worsening liver enzymes and worsening abdominal distention. Pt
does have a history of HCC with nodules measuring 2.9 x 2.2 cm
and 1.3 x 1.1 cm (segment 8) with attempted EtOH ablation.
However, patient decompensated during the procedure and only one
tumor was successfully ablated. Per OMR note in liver tumor
board, patient does have residual tumor (2.6 x 1.7 cm) and was
considered a non-candidate for further procedures.

He was admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] from [**2142-6-22**] - [**2142-6-27**] for abdominal
pain, jaundice, and melena. He was admitted to the MICU because
of hypotension, requiring pressor support. His abdominal pain
was thought to be related to gall bladder etiology; however,
reports of a negative HIDA scan in setting of worsening ascites.
Patient was transfused 3 units pRBC for Hct 20 on presentation.
His INR
was 5.7 and rose to 11 on his day of discharge. No attempts for
paracentesis or endoscopies. He was treated conservatively with
blood products and antibiotics for SBP prophylaxis. With initial
laboratory values, MELD 33 on admission. He was discharged on
[**2142-6-27**].

Due to worsening symptoms of lethargy and persistent melena,
patient reported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. On arrival,
INR found to be 8.5. From labs, MELD score 46. Admitted to MICU
for upper endoscopy, which only showed esophageal varices.
Patient still with Hct 20's and currently transfused 3u pRBC, 8u
FFP, 2u platelets, 4u cryoprecipitate. CT scan negative for any
intra-abdominal bleeding. He is receiving vancomycin for one
blood culture positive for coag negative stap and cipro for SBP
prophylaxis. Plan for colonoscopy this evening.

Per patient, reports weight gain of 30lbs over 1 month, acute
worsening jaundice and feeling fatigued. Denies any fevers, SOB,
or chest pains. Frequent diarrhea bc of lactulose. His last
drink was [**2142-3-3**]. All other ROS negative.

[**2142-6-26**] Renal U/S IMPRESSION IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis of the liver without concerning liver lesions.
2. Splenomegaly and ascites, suggests portal hypertension.
3. Reversal of flow in the main portal vein.
.
.
[**2142-6-27**] Echo IMPRESSION There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A
mid-cavitary gradient is identified. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present
but cannot be quantified. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
.
[**2142-6-28**] CT Chest w/out contrast IMPRESSIONS:  1. No evidence of
intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage to explain drop in
hematocrit. 2. Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly and
intra-abdominal and esophageal varices, and a small amount of
ascites, compatible with portal hypertension. 3. Small bilateral
pleural effusions, with greater than expected degree of
consolidation at the right lung base, and scattered foci of
nodular ground glass opacity bilaterally, which is concerning
for aspiration or infection. 4. Mild anasarca and mesenteric
stranding compatible with third spacing.
.
.
[**2142-6-28**] CT Abdomen w/out contrast IMPRESSION 1. No evidence of
intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage to explain drop in
hematocrit. 2. Cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly and
intra-abdominal and esophageal varices, and a small amount of
ascites, compatible with portal hypertension. 3. Small bilateral
pleural effusions, with greater than expected degree of
consolidation at the right lung base, and scattered foci of
nodular ground glass opacity bilaterally, which is concerning
for aspiration or infection. 4. Mild anasarca and mesenteric
stranding compatible with third spacing.
.
.
[**7-2**] Bone Scan:
1. No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.
2. Findings compatible with diffuse anasarca and possible
ascites as described above.
3. Altered biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical with
relative poor uptake in the bones and increased uptake in the
kidneys of unclear etiology.
.
.
[**7-2**] MRI/MRA Liver:
1. Three lesions in the segment VIII of the liver at the dome,
the largest one measuring 2.5 cm and arterial enhancing with
washout at delayed phase. Two additional 1 cm lesions
demonstrates only arterial enhancement without washout, but that
are new as compared to the prior examination. In the known
history of cirrhosis, these lesions most probably correspond to
foci of HCC.
.
2. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusion.
.
3. Small amount of ascites.
.
4. Large recanalized paraumbilical vein.
.
5. Mild splenomegaly.
.
6. Irregular mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
