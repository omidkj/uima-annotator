Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for EP study/VT ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP study s/p mapping/ablation

History of Present Illness:
48 yo M with hx of CAD, MI x2, CABG x4 [**1-13**], EF 15-20%, hx of VT
s/p ICD, multiple ICD shocks and noted slow VT, admitted to
[**Hospital3 17921**] Center in NH on [**2110-11-1**] after having his ICD
fire 10 times followed by few seconds of syncope despite being
on amiodarone and quinidine.  He has been having recurrent VT
which was treated with amiodarone dose, quinidine, and increased
Beta-blocker.  He reports that he could feel the PVC's and slow
VT's and could tell the threshold before having the syncopal
episode.  He was recently cathed on [**9-12**] to rule out ischemic
component of dysrrhythmia which showed patent grafts.  Since he
was discharged, he has had several ICD shocks and was treated
with increasing dose of B-blocker.  On the day of admission to
[**Hospital3 17921**] Center, he had 10 ICD firings, one of which was
associtated with loss of consciousness for few seconds.  At
[**Hospital3 17921**], pt was started on amiodarone and lidocaine
drips.  ICD interrogation revealed a slow VT which was
terminated with pacing.  He was also found to have another fast
VT.  Now with AV (atrial/biventricular) pacing after device
reprogramming.  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for VT ablation.

In the EP lab here, aggressive attempts were made to induce the
sustained VT but only short runs of short VT were induced.
Mapping and ablation of multiple foci of slow VT were done.
Fast monomorphic VT w/ LBBB/L axis occurred (not induced) which
were not pace terminable requiring shock 360 J x3 and then
converted to sinus rhythm.

EP History:
History of VT '[**08**] s/p ICD placement, hx of multiple recurrent
ICD shock between [**2108**]-[**2109**], hx of slow monophasic VT (580-590
msec) noted in 4/'[**09**], which was pace terminated and ICD
reprogrammed, upgrade to biventricular ICD [**2110-7-30**], VT ablation
[**2110-8-5**].  EP study on [**2110-9-10**] after having ICD firing after
rapid VT 320-360 msec which failed to terminate with pacing.
Study showed 4 episodes of sustained monomorphic VT (320-340
msec), series of ATP algorithms tested but no successful
termination + was ultimatley terminated with shock.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2110-11-6**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.

FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2110-11-8**]):    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA
FOUND.

   CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2110-11-8**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2110-11-6**]):
      FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
      Reference Range:  Negative.

CXR [**11-5**]:  There is moderate cardiomegaly in a patient with
dual lead pacemaker insertion. The pacemaker chips overlie the
right atrium and ventricle. Patient has undergone prior CABG.
There is bilateral moderate pulmonary vascular redistribution
and perihilar haziness. The osseous structures are unremarkable.

CXR [**11-6**]:  Stable moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly in a patient
status post CABG. The dual-lead pacemaker tips overlie the right
atrium and ventricle. There is a slightly improved pulmonary
vascular redistribution and interstitial edema. The osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
Slight interval improvement in CHF.

[**11-6**]:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Patchy opacity is
present within the right lung base which could represent
atelectasis. The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, adrenal
glands, kidneys, and small bowel are normal in appearance. No
pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph
nodes are seen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is focal fat stranding
within the pelvic fat surrounding the sigmoid colon. There are
multiple diverticula. There is extraluminal gas adjacent to this
area of fat stranding. There is no drainable fluid collection.
Oral contrast reaches the transverse colon indicating no
evidence of obstruction.

Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

REFORMATTED IMAGING: Images reformatted in the coronal and
sagittal plane were essential in evaluating the patient's
abdomen and pelvis and show fat stranding within the deep pelvis
adjacent to the sigmoid colon, indicating diverticulitis.

IMPRESSION: Sigmoid diverticulitis with a suggestion of
microperforation. No drainable fluid collection present.

AXR [**11-6**]:  Left upper chest pacemaker device, sternal wires and
mediastinal clips are noted. The heart appears enlarged. There
is no free air. Images of the abdomen are of poor technical
quality. A nonspecific bowel gas pattern is noted.

AXR [**11-8**]:  Gaseous distention of stomach and moderate gaseous
distention of multiple loops of small bowel with retained
contrast in the rectosigmoid colon. Findings could be related to
ileus in the presence of intra-abdominal inflammatory process
but correlate clinically. The gaseous distention of the stomach
could be re- eva
