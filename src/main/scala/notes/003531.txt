Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Hospital3 628**] for management of tachy-brady
syndrome/cardiac pauses.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1)Temporary pacing wire placement
2)Permanent dual pacemakder placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of DVT/PE on coumadin,
intermittent AF, CHF with EF 45% who presents from [**Hospital 620**] Hosp
for multiple pauses in the setting of CHF exacerbation. The
patient initially presented to his PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) **] for a routine
visit and was found to be tachycardic with an "abnormal ECG",
per patient's niece. He was subsequently admitted to [**Hospital 882**]
hospital ([**Date range (1) 57274**]/07). In the ED, he was tachypneic,
tachycardic, and hypoxemic. CXR at the time showed bibasilar
consolidations and TTE revealed a slightly depressed EF (45%)
and elevated PA pressures. He was treated for both CHF and
community-acquired pneumonia.
.
The patient did well until [**8-2**], when he went for follow-up to
the pulmonologist, where he had a CXR revealing pulmonary edema
with similar symptoms of shortness of breath and hypoxia and was
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for CHF exacerbation (BNP 6141,
Trop 0.055). However, on [**8-4**], he was transferred to the ICU for
persistent tachycardia to the 110s thought to be AF/flutter. He
was started on digoxin load and maintenance, IV lopressor, and
IV lasix while there. On [**8-6**] he had 2 episodes of cardiac pauses
(10s at 10:30am, 24s at 4:30pm). BP remained stable during these
episodes. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
On transfer from [**Location (un) 620**]-- SBP 110s, HR 80s, afib with PVCs and
no pauses, 100% on 2L.
.
On review of symptoms, he admits to DVT/PE, but he denies any
prior history of stroke, TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.

Past Medical History:
1)DVT/PE on coumadin-In [**11-5**], the patient had several episodes
of shortness of breath in the setting of left leg swelling for
4-6 weeks.  US showed clot from the left common femoral vein to
the left popliteal vein.  PE CT showed non-oclusive pulmonary
emboli bilaterally in the upper lobe arteries.  On ECHO, there
was no evidence for right sided heart strain.  He was discharged
on Coumadin 5mg Daily with INR goal of [**3-5**].

2)Intermittent AF-Present during the [**7-7**] [**Hospital 882**] Hospital
admission.  At this time, he was started on Diltiazem.

3)CHF-ECHO in [**11-5**] at an OSH showed an EF of 60% with LVH, nml
LV size.  Dilated LA, RA.  Nomral size RV and nml RV function.
Mild AS, Trace TR.  In [**7-7**], an ECHO at an [**Last Name (LF) 57275**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was 45%
with LVH, nml LV size, Dilated LA.  RV enlargement with
hypokinesis, mild AS, 1+ MR, 1+TR, PAP of 34mmHg.

4)Hearing loss with hearing aids

5)Right bundle branch block, ? trifascicular block-In 4/89, EKG
showed 1st degree AV block and RBBB.

6)History of asbestos exposure

7)Hernia repair in 4/95


Social History:
Patient previously lived alone in [**Location (un) 620**].  His brother lives
near by and checks on him frequently.  The patient was a former
shipyard worker, carpenter.  He stopped smoking 20 years ago and
he uses alcohol rarley. His brother [**Name (NI) 122**] is his health care

Pertinent Results:
EKG:Atach vs afib, RBBB w LAFB, Q in II, III, aVF, 1mm STD/TWI
in V2-4
.
CXR [**2101-8-6**]:  Calcified pleural plaques consistent with previous
asbestos exposure.  There is blunting of the bilateral
costophrenic angels that may be pleural thickening or pleural
effusions.
.
CXR [**2101-8-9**]:  Confirms placement of a pacemaker with leads in
the right atrium and right ventricle.   There is improvement of
the bilateral infiltrates.  A 10mm in diameter denisty was noted
in the upper lobe of the right lung.  Pleural plaques are
unchanced from previous studies.
.
ECHO [**2101-8-8**]:  Sym LVH, nml LV cavity size, global LV hypokinesis
with LVEF of 35%.  RA dilation.  RV dilation with depressed RV
function.  Moderate AS with peak velocity of 3.0, peak gradient
of 36mmHg.  1+ AR, 1+ MR, trivial TR.
.
.
Head CT [**2101-8-9**].  Demonstrated no acute intracranial process
ushc as mass effect, infarcts, intracranial hemorrhage.  IThere
is calcification of the flax cerebri.
.
Video Swallowing Study [**2101-8-11**]-Showed mild dysphagia and
aspiration on thin liquids corrected by compensatory maneurves
such as chin tuck.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 57277**] is [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of DVT/PE on
coumadin, A-Fib/aflutter, CHF with an EF of 45% who presents
with a CHF exacerbation and extensive cardiac pauses during
sleep.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] CCU for further
work up
.
Asystolic Pauses/Rhythm-On admission, the patient was found to
be in A-fib with episodes of bradycardia and sinus pauses
(lasting up to 20-30 seconds.)    This was thought to  that was
thought to be possibly due to tach-brady syndrome and
significant conduction system disease.  The patient was placed
on telemetry and followed with serial EKG.  On [**2101-8-7**], a
temporary pacing line was placed.  Metoprolol was used to
control episodes of tachycardia to the 120's.  On [**2101-8-8**], a dual
pacemaker device with leads in the right atrium and ventricle
was placed.  The pacemaker was interrogated on [**2101-8-9**] and PA
and lateral chest x-rays confirmed t
