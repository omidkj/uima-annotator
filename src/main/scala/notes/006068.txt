History of Present Illness:

myalgias, diaphoresis, any recent sick contacts, and states that
the only time she has ever felt this way in the past was ??????many

CXR [**12-9**]:
This study is compared to prior study of 1 day earlier. Left
lower lobe infiltration appears to be more pronounced at this
time. The remainder of the lungs have not significantly changed.
Scattered areas of patchy infiltration throughout the right lung
are noted. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or
pneumothoraces.
IMPRESSION:
Interval increase in the degree of left lower lobe infiltration
which may indicate a superimposed pneumonia. Bilateral pulmonary
vascular congestion and patchy areas of infiltrate are
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pulm: Pt initally presented on [**12-8**] with SOB which improved
when lying flat, dry, non-productive cough, and generalized
weakness/fatigue. CXR showed patchy infiltrates, and given her
lack of orthopnea and flat JVP, it was thought that she had
either an atypical PNA or influenza. She was started empirically
on levofloxacin 250 mg. The next early morning [**12-9**], she
developed a fever to 102.5, chills, and desats down to 70's on
6L NC with any movement. Abx coverage was broadened to
Vanc/Ceftraixone/azithro; nebs improved breathing moderately.
The next morning, she was afebrile but continued to have desats
down to 70's even with 10L NC. ABG was 7.39/43/106 on 70% face
mask, lactate 2.5. Repeat CXR revealed more evidence of patchy
infiltrates, particularly LLL consolidation. At this point,
given her rapid desaturations with even slight movements such as
turning in bed, it was thought that she may benefit from closer
observation in the MICU. Influenza A/B rapaid screen was
negative. Viral Cx, urine Legionalla negative.

2. Cards: On initial presentation in the ED, her CXR was read as
CHF; however, this was thought to be unlikely given her lack of
PND, orthopnea, edema, or JVD on exam.
--Rhythm: NSR, occasionally tachycardic likely secondary to
infection and dehydration.
--Ischemia: On [**12-9**], she had an episode of desaturation down to
70's. EKG at the time revealed some ST seg depressions in I,
V4-6. Troponin was 0.05. Repeat cardiac enzymes are pending.
--Pump: Pt had no record of echo in OMR, given hx of HTN, DM,
etc, and echo was obtained to further assess cardiac function.
Also, her BP remained stable throughout this hospitalization.
Initially, her antihypertensives were held given her
dehydration. Then, Lopressor 12.5 mg TID was started with SBP
150's.

3. DM: Pt has type II DM which had been previously controlled on
Glyburide 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]. During the hospital stay, her regimen was
changed to glyburide 5 mg [**Hospital1 **] with meals, 12U NPH at bedtime,
and Regular sliding scale, which offered tighter glycemic
control.

The patient's pulmonary status continued to worsen, and thoracic
CT scans showed evidence of persistent ARDS.  She became
increasingly difficult to oxygenate with marked acidosis and was
eventually paralyzed and started on CMVI mode, but without
benefit. As these heroic measures did not improve her status,
following discussion with the next-of-[**Doctor First Name **], the decision was to
focus care on comfort, and Ms. [**Known lastname 107922**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] quietly.
