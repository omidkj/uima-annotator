History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y/o cantonese speaking male with h/o dementia,
motor aphasia, COPD (on home O2 5L) and recent admission for
aspiration PNA in [**9-/2172**] who was transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 745**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
due to hypoxia and hemodynamic instability.
.
.
Patient was most recently addmitted to the MICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**]) 4 weeks
ago with aspiration pneumonia and sepsis. He was treated with
wide spectrum abx (initially vanc, zosyn, and levofloxacin then
narrowed to Unasyn + vancomycin for positive MRSA swab).  Speech
and swallow confirmed presence of aspiration and recommended
dysphagia diet. Tube feeding was discussed with family at the
time who decided that this would not be compatible with
patient's goals as he enjoys eating. He was discharged on [**10-3**]
to [**Hospital3 **] where he completed Abx course and Chest PT,
on [**10-27**] he was started in fludrocortisone for low BP's. On the
same day he was transfered from to lower level facility at
[**Location (un) 169**] in [**Location (un) 745**]. Prior to the current admission patient
would ambulate with help, His baseline O2 prior to previous
admission was 2L and since discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] 5L.
.
Presented to [**Hospital6 4620**] this morning d/t acute
respiratory decompensation from the day of admission with
hypoxia to the 80's on O2. Unclear if recent febrile illness,
aspiration event or other symptoms or triggers.
.
At [**Hospital6 4620**], the patient was found to be
hypoxic 88% on 5Ln and hypotensive, max temp was 99.6. CXR
revealed b/l PNA. Received one dose of vancomycin+zosyn (16:00),
2L IVF, and was started on neo due to systolic in the 70s.  No
available ICU beds so transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED here the patient had VS 98.4, BP  117/57 on neo 3
mcg/kg, noted to be tachycardic to 121 and tachypnic to the 30's
while satting low 90's on non-rebreather.  Neosinephrine was
continued. Received nebulizer therapy with minimal improvement.
Recieved IV solumedrole. A CXR confirmed b/l PNA. Labs showed
WBC 30,000 w/ 95% Neu, lactate 3.3. trop neg X1. Of note (BNP at
OSH = 100). Attempt at femoral line X2 failed. ED resident spoke
to patient's son and HCP on the phone, confirmed DNI, no central
lines, ok with Abx, fluids and peripheral vasopressors.

Studies:
.
CXR ([**2172-10-31**]) - IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities predominantly in
the right lower lung and in the left mid and lower lung zones.
The pattern mimics that seen on prior radiographs with slightly
more confluent opacity on the current study. This may be due to
asymmetric distribution of edema due to underlying emphysema or
possibly multifocal pneumonia. Correlate clinically. Consider
diuresis and short interval followup radiographs to help
discriminate the two.

[**11-3**]: Widespread pulmonary opacification has not changed
appreciably since [**Month (only) 359**].  How much of this is pneumonia and
how much pulmonary edema is radiographically indeterminate.
Sparing of the right upper lobe is probably due to emphysema.
Small right pleural effusion and mild cardiomegaly persists.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y/o male with h/o dementia, non-verbal aphasia
(prior Cantonese speaking only), COPD (on home O2 5L) and recent
admission for PNA in [**9-/2172**] who was transferred from [**Hospital 55955**] due to hypoxia and hemodynamic instability.
He was treated for possible aspiration vs hospital acquired
pneumonia and returned to his baseline 5L oxygen requirement.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# sepsis/SIRS: Patient presented with leukocytosis, tachycardia
and hypotension, suspected pulmonary source in this patient with
a history of aspiration.  Blood cultures and urinary cultures
were negative. He was briefly managed on levophed for low blood
pressure but was quickly weaned off. His blood pressure
normalized and he remained hemodynamically stable for remainder
of hospitalization.
.
# Pneumonia: Initial presentation was consistent with pneumonia,
aspiration vs HAP. He was treated with a 7 day course of IV
vancomycin and zosyn.  Blood cultures, sputum cultures and viral
screen were all negative. His chest xray was consistent with
underlying interstitial lung disease, likely secondary to
chronic aspiration. Patient initially required face mask to
maintain oxygen saturation, however he was quickly weaned down
to his home requirement of [**3-24**] L nasal canula.
.
# Hypoxia: Thought to be secondary to aspiration
pneumonia/pneumonitis. He had no overt signs of heart failure
with a normal BNP at OSH. He required face mask for oxygenation
intially, however has since been weaned down to his home oxygen
requirement. He was continued on standing ipratropium and
albuterol. He also has evidence of emphysematous blebs at the
apices bilaterally which have been stable and likely contribute
to his home oxygen requirement.
.
# Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive on admission to SBP 70s.
He was
