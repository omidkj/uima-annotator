Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Aortic balloon pump placement
Mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is 80 yo man presenting with chest pain and ST
elevations on EKG.  He was in usual state of health until 6 pm
on day of admission after eating dinner.  He started to have
chest pressure and reflux and was noted to be diapheretic.  Pt
was brought to the ED by EMS who administered Heparin and SL
nitro.

In the ED HR ranged in 60s and SBP initially 140 then in 110s.
O2 sat upper 90% on 5L --> NRB. His initial ECG suggested 1 mm
STE in III, avF and avR as well as [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depression in I, avL
V4-6. In cath lab he also had 1 mm STE in V1.

On presentation to the ICU, patient was intubated and
unresponsive with a aortic balloon pump in place.

Review of systems unable to obtain secondary to intubation,
however, patient's family reports he was fine prior to onset at
symptoms at 6pm.

Imaging:
[**10-22**] Cardiac cath (preliminary)
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated two-vessel coronary disease.  The LMCa, LCx, and
ramus had
no angiographically-significant CAD.  The LAD had a smooth
tubular 70%
lesion in the proximal segment of the vessel.  The RCA had 65%
proximal-to-mid vessel stenosis.  These latter two lesions did
not
appear flow-limiting.
2) Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately-elevated left-sided
filling
pressures with a PA diastolic pressure of 26 mmHg and a mean
wedge
pressure of 26 mmHg.  The mixed venous oxygen saturation was low
at 40%,
which, with a systemic arterial oxygen saturation of 99%,
correlated
with a Fick cardiac output of approximately 1 l/min/m2.
3) Because of relative hypotension and a low cardiac index, a
40cc IABP
was placed.  The mixed venous oxygen saturation was rechecked
after
placement of the IABP, and was noted to be 49% (increased from
40% prior
to IABP placement).  This also correlated with an improvement in
the
patient's lactate from 5.1 initially to 3 after IABP placement.
The
patient was then given 1 liter of IV fluids, after which time a
third
mixed venous oxygen saturation was checked and was noted to be
54%.
4) A bilateral pulmonary arteriogram was performed to exclude
significant PE, and showed no intraluminal defects.
5) Urgent transthoracic echocardiogram performed in the cath lab
to
evaluate potential causes of cardiogenic shock revealed
trace-to-mild
aortic regurgitation with relatively preserved ejection fraction
and no
wall motion abnormalities.
6) A shunt run showed no significant oxygen saturation step-up.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Trace-to-mild aortic regurgitation.
3. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Altered mental status.

[**10-22**] Echo:
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The sinuses of Valsalva
are dilated. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**10-23**] CT Head:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Old right occipital infarct and chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.
3. Prominent ventricles without mass lesion; considerations
include atrophic change versus normal pressure hydrocephalus.

[**10-23**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above
the carina. The aortic balloon pump is in correct position. The
Swan-Ganz catheter has been inserted over an inferior access.
The tip projects over the left pulmonary artery.

Moderate cardiomegaly with relatively extensive retrocardiac
atelectasis and blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that
small pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Mild pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumonia.

[**10-23**] CXR:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube
and
the intra-aortic balloon pump are in unchanged position.
Swan-Ganz catheter over inferior access, the tip of the catheter
projects over the left pulmonary artery.

Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. Slightly improving areas of
left basal
atelectasis. No overt pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.

[**10-23**] CTA Torso:
1. Type A aortic dissection with dissection extending to the
ostia of the
coronary arteries, and findings consistent with rupture of the
false lumen in the aortic root and small mediastinal hematoma.
The coronary arteries remain perfused by the true lumen at the
time of this scan.

2. Additional extension of aortic dissection to the branch
vessels of the
aorta including right subclavian, right common carotid, left
subclavian,
celiac, SMA, left renal artery. The left kidney is hypoperfused
with
developing infarcts.

3. Extension of dissection to the splenic artery with splenic
infarcts.

4. Heterogeneous perfusion of the liver. The hepatic artery
appears to be
supplied by the true lumen.

5. No specific evidence of bowel ischemia at the present time
although
dissection extends into the superior mesenteric artery. Mild
stranding about the cecum and ascending colon is nonspecific at
the present time though continued observation for bowel ischemia
would be warranted depending on the clinical status given the
elevated lactate.

6. Small right inguinal hem
