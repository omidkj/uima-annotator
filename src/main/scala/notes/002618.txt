IMAGING:

[**2141-10-23**]:
XR L HIP - Left femoral neck fracture
CXR - Findings compatible with mild pulmonary vascular
congestion. Please note there may be a component of underlying
interstitial lung disease. Clinical correlation is advised.
Follow-up films post-diuresis advised
CT LLE -
1. Impacted femoral neck fracture with external rotation of the
distal femoral shaft.
2. OA with chondrocalcinosis.
3. Diffuse calcified atherosclerotic disease.
4. Fat-containing inguinal hernia on the left.
5. Fatty atrophy of gluteus medius muscle.
CTA CHEST -
1. No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection.
2. Ground-glass opacification, bilateral effusions, smooth
septal thickening and reflux of contrast into the IVC consistent
with congestive heart failure.
3. Emphysema.
4. Nodule in the right upper lobe may represent asymmetirc
pulmonary edema, however follow-up after treatment is
recommended to ensure resolution and exclude an underlying mass.

5. Multilevel spinal degenerative changes.
6. Mediastinal and hilar adenpathy likely due to CHF, this will
be
reevaluated at the time of follow-up CT scan.
7. Secretions in the trachea raise the possible of aspiration.

[**2141-10-24**]:
CXR -
1. New left basal increase in left basal consolidation,
concerning for
aspiration given short-term interval change.
2. Background of emphysema and bilateral perihilar opacities,
worrisome for chronic aspiration. Improvement in the
interstitial edema. Right upper lobe nodular density as
described in the prior CT, followup to resolution remains
recommended.

[**2141-10-25**]:
ECHO - The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

CXR - In comparison with the study of [**10-24**], there is continued
bibasilar
opacification consistent with atelectasis and effusion. The
possibility of supervening pneumonia must be considered. No
evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure persists.



Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of atrial fibrillation not on
coumadin, HTN, who presented after a mechanical fall with a left
hip fracture. Hospital course by problem.
.
#.Left Hip Fracture: The patient had a fracture of his left
femoral neck.  He was seen by orthopedics who recommended
hemi-arthroplasty once medically stable.  His tachycardia and
dyspnea were treated and he went to the operating room on
hospital day #3.  He tolerated the surgery well with
approximately 300ccs blood loss.  He received fentanyl
post-operatively which made him hypotensive.  Further pain
control was with Tylenol only.  He was started on Calcium and
Vitamin D for prevention of future fractures.  He was started on
Lovenox DVT prophylaxis which he should take for four weeks.  He
should follow-up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in Dr.[**Name (NI) 8091**]
office.  His hip has full weight-bearing capacity.
.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient has known baseline
atrial fibrillation, rate controlled with metoprolol and
nifedipine, on just Aspirin at home.  On hospital day #2 he
became tachycardic to the 130s in the setting of delirium and
agitation.  His rate could not be controlled with extra doses of
PO and IV metoprolol and small fluid boluses.  He was
transferred to the ICU because of difficulty managing him on the
floor nad persistent tachycardia.  He was continued on his home
dose of metoprolol and started on a diltiazem drip.  His heart
rate then improved along with his mental status.  He is being
discharged on an increased dose of short-acting metoprolol but
can be transitioned back to metoprolol XL.  He is being
discharged on short-acting diltiazem but can be transitioned to
longer-acting diltiazem.
.
# Altered mental status: The patient was alert and ori
