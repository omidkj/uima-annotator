Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3624**]
Chief Complaint:
Bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIJ portacath removed, RIJ TPL placed

History of Present Illness:
46 year-old male c ESRD s.p renal tpl x 4, HCV, HTN, aortic
stenosis who is transferred from NH with bacteremia.  Port was
placed at [**Hospital3 68**] on [**12-16**] for ARF from dehydration
from nausea and vomiting.  On [**1-2**] he spiked a fever of 101.9;
blood cultures were positive for MRSA on [**1-2**] and group D
enterococcus.  Initial urine cx with group D enterococcus;
subsequent was negative.  He was started on daptomycin.  His
anti-hypertensive regimen was increased.  With IVF his Cr went
from 3.3 to 2.6 on transfer.  He was transfused 2 units pRBCs on
[**12-18**].
.
Of note, pt had a recent hospitalization [**2152-11-24**] -> [**2152-12-3**]. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH for worsening renal failure
and hypotension, felt to be possibly due to orthostasis. Here,
he was found to have MRSA in his urine which was treated with
linezolid (last dose planned for [**12-15**]). He was in renal failure
at the OSH and required HD. Here his peak Cr was 4.0 (felt to be
due to bactrim, which was initially used to treat his MRSA) and
it was felt that he had a prerenal azotemia in addition to drug
toxicity. His cyclosporine levels were elevated as well, which
may have contributed to his renal failure. His Cr at discharge
was 3.3. He remained on cyclosporine for his renal transplant,
along with azathioprine and prednisone. For his hypotension,
autonomic testing confirmed orthostatic hypotension. Multiple
etiologies were entertained, including cervical cord compression
(MRI showed C5-6 disc herniation and moderate spinal stenosis),
hypovolemia, medication effects (he was on labetalol and
prazosin at the time), and neuropathy. He was educated in
various dietary changes and advised to keep upright posture as
much as possible. He was scheduled to f/u in the outpatient
neurology clinic. At the OSH, he had had a hypercarbic
respiratory failure but he was extubated without incident and
had no other respiratory issues as an inpatient at [**Hospital1 18**]. He was
maintained on his outpatient inhaler regimen. For his seizure
disorder, he was transitioned from dilantin to keppra. For his
hypertension, his medications were changed to amlodipine and
metoprolol, with higher thresholds given his newly diagnosed
orthostatic hypotension.
.
On arrival he complains of bilateral arm and leg pain ([**8-26**]).
He denies fever, chills, cough, dysuria, graft pain, rash.  He
reports diarrhea up until last week, which has since resolved.

TEE:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Aortic valve gradient was not
assessed in this study. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

ULTRASOUND OF LOWER EXTREMITIES [**2154-1-7**]
1. Acute/subacute nonocclusive thrombus within the right common
femoral vein extending into the greater saphenous vein and
proximal superficial femoral vein.

U/S OF TRANSPLANTED KIDNEY [**2154-1-8**] : WNL

MRI CERVICAL SPINE [**2153-1-17**]
1. Large right central disc extrusion at the C5/6 level as
before, which is severely compressing the right ventral cord and
causing cord edema.

2. New diffuse edema of the visualized subcutaneous fat as well
as new minimal amount of prevertebral edema/fluid. The lack of
IV gadolinium limits the evaluation for infectious process.
However, given the generalized nature of the edema, the
prevertebral findings likely represent changes of generalized
edema as opposed to prevertebral cellulitis from an infectious
process.

3. Minimal amount of T2 hyperintensity of the anterior disc at
the C5/6 and C6/7 levels, which is a nonspecific finding. There
are no adjacent destructive changes to suggest spondylodiscitis.
If there is strong concern for an infectious process, consider
reevaluation with gadolinium.

MRI C SPINE [**2153-1-19**] W/WO CONTRAST
1. Study significantly limited due to patient motion.
2. No obvious enhancement in the intervertebral discs at C5-6
and C6-7 levels. No evidence of discitis at these levels.
3. Unchanged appearance of the small amount of prevertebral
edema/fluid in the cervical spine; mild increase in the
posterior spinal soft tissue increased signal from
edema/inflammation. No obvious abscess is noted, within the
limitations of this study from patient motion artifacts.
4. No evidence of cord compression in the thoracic spine.
5. Severe cord compression in the cervical spine, from large
right paracentral disc extrusion at C5-6, unchanged.
6. Large bilateral pleural effusions.

MRI, HEAD [**2153-1-19**]
1. No evidence of meningitis or acute intracranial process.
2. Bilateral increased signal in both mastoid sinuses is
