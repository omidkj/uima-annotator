Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right ij cordis
a-line
Temporary pacemaker placed and removed


History of Present Illness:
71 year old female with h/o morbid obesity, COPD/asthma, DM,
HTN, CAD s/p PTCA distal LAD ([**2177-7-31**]) with 2 episodes of chest
pain resolved by sublingual NTG x 1 and complaining of
SOB/wheezing.  By the time the patient arrived in the ED she had
no complaints of chest pain.  Her EKG showed HR in the 40's and
junctional rhythm.  She was given aspirin.  CXR done and without
pneumonia/pulm edema.  She was also in acute renal failure with
K 6.4, Cr 4.0.  A Right IJ cordis was placed in the ED and she
was started on dopamine.
.
Patient had a similar presentation in [**9-14**] when she presented in
a junctional rhythm and acute renal failure.  It was felt that
she was pre-renal and once fluids were given her renal funtion
improved.  The junctional rhythm was felt to be due to
beta-blocker toxicity and also resolved.
.
ROS: difficult to obtain as patient lethargic, but oriented.

[**2177-11-5**] CXR: Cardiomegaly is stable given differences in
projection. Perihilar haze is not significantly changed from
previous radiographs and may represent patient's baseline. No
interstitial lines or pulmonary engorgement is identified. No
airspace opacities are present.
.
[**11-8**] Echo: Conclusions:
1. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
2. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
3. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-8-1**],
there is
probably no significant change.
.
[**11-7**] Renal US: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old female with h/o morbid obesity,
COPD/asthma, diabetes mellitus, HTN, CAD s/p PTCA to distal LAD
([**2177-7-31**]) who presents to the ED with chest pain, SOB.
.
Cardiac: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with junctional escape and
hypotension.  She has a known history of LAD disease, s/p PTCA
in [**7-15**], EF 60%.  In the ED, her BP was 86/51 and HR in the 40s
so she was given glucagon (pt was on metoprolol and CCB),
kayexelate 30 g, dopamine gtt, 2 liters NS, insulin and Ca
gluconate in ED.  Beta blockers were held and cardiac enzymes
were cycled.  Her troponins were slightly elevated with peak at
0.07, peak CK at 160.  Both trended down over the course of the
hospitalization.  BNP on admission was elevated at 3563.  She
had an elevated CVP which was felt to be secondary to OSA.  CXR
was clear without evidence of pulmonary edema and no clinical
signs of CHF.  In MICU, SBP 150s and HR 60s.  She developed
pulmonary edema which responded to lasix.  A temporary pacer
with screw-in lead was put in place by the EP service on [**11-6**]
and the patient was transferred to the CCU.  She was put back on
an aspirin and statin.  Her lasix was held.  The patient was
temporarily pacer dependent.  A permanent pacemaker was
considered, however, the patient began pacing on her own and a
permanent pacemaker became unnecessary and the temporary screw
lead was removed on [**11-10**].  The etiology of the patient's sick
sinus and stunned atria was felt to be due to her hyperkalemia
and acute renal failure.  A low dose beta blocker was restarted,
however her ACE inhibitor was held and renal artery stenosis was
ruled out with a normal renal US.  An MRI was not performed as
the patient is unable to fit in MR machine.  She was started on
coumadin for atrial fibrillation and INR will be checked as an
outpatient.  Plavix was discontinued.  She was followed in the
CCU by her primary cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  ACE inhibitor should
be restarted at her first PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
.
ARF: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 4.5 (baseline 1.3).  A FeNa was calculated and
found to be <1% and FeUrea 12.5%, both indicative of pre-renal
renal failure, however possibly in setting of low cardiac output
from bradycardia.  The renal service was consulted in the ED and
felt there was no urgent indication for HD.  K was 6.2 on
presentation and 5.5 on recheck.  Electrolytes were checked
frequently while the patient was in renal failure and fluids
were given.  Potassium normalized and was 3.5 on d/c.  A renal
ultrasound was performed which showed no hydronephrosis.  The
patient's creatinine normalized prior to discharge.  Her ace
inhibitor was held, but will be restarted at first outpatient
f/u visit as above.
.
Pulm:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with shortness of breath and
wheezing which could was felt to be secondary to a COPD flare.
She was treated with fluticasone/salmeterol inh, fluticasone
nasal spray and ipratroprium inh.  A CXR was clear.  She was put
on BiPap per her home regimen.
.
Hypertension: Ms. [**Known lastname **] blood pressure stabilized after
admission and became difficult to control.  She was treated with
Isosorbide Dinitrate 10 mg PO TID, Hydralazine HCl 20 mg IV Q6H,
Clonidine HCl 0.2 mg PO BID, and Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily.
.
Diabetes: The patient was on insulin sliding scale with finger
sticks.  Glyburide was held.
