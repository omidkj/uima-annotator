Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, weakness, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
82 year old with paroxysmal afib, h/o superior mesenteric vein
thrombosis on coumadin since [**2143**], chronic renal insufficiency
(baseline Cr 1.2-1.3) and MM diagnosed in [**2144**], on Revlimid
therapy (last dose 1 week ago) recently diagnosed UTI on Cipro,
awoke this morning with new weakness, SOB and malaise. Revlimid
has been held since [**6-7**]. On Tues. [**6-7**] pt. experienced dysuria,
dribbling stream and difficulty urinating. Was seen at [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Location (un) 1439**], UA was done and per pt. was dx with UTI and given Cipro.
He states his symptoms are slightly improved since last week but
that he has continued to have difficulty urinating. His wife
states that over the course of the week he was intermittently
confused, at one point getting lost on his way from the
bathroom, though patient denies this. On the day prior to
admission the patient developed a productive cough and shortness
of breath. He does not produce frank sputum and denies
hemoptysis. States that his appetite has been decreased over the
past week or so. Denies any fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting,
changes in ostomy output or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] does endorse
increased weakness. He ambulates with a walker at baseline but
on the day of admission was unable to ambulate without
assistance so he presented to the ED.

In the ED, febrile to 101.6. BP 110/82 P 88 RR 22 91%RA. Started
on levaquin and vanco and also received duonebs for wheeze. CXR
concerning for multifocal pneumonia. Patient could not provide
urine sample. Blood cultures were sent and patient was started
on levofloxacin and vancomycin for PNA vs. UTI. Patient was
originally requested for medicine floor bed, but he dropped his
pressures into 80/40's with increased sluggishness and O2
desaturation to 88%. He was responsive to 2L NS and supplemental
O2.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS: T 96.2 P 83 BP 82/55, RR
21 91% 2LNC


Past Medical History:
MULTIPLE MYELOMA TREATMENT HISTORY:
# Multiple Myeloma: on treatment with Revlimid
     Initially presented with T12 compression fracture, ARF,
hypercalcemia and SMV thrombosis in [**2143**]. During this evaluation
he was diagnosed with MM. Treated with 6 cycles of VAD then on
Thalidomide in [**12-12**]. He received monthly Pamidronate from the
time of diagnosis to [**8-/2147**] when he was switched to Zometa. He
continued thalidomide until [**10/2148**] when it was stopped due to
debilitating symptoms of ataxia and peripheral neuropathy. He
continued monthly Zometa until [**12/2150**], when he was switched to
every other month. In [**4-/2151**], the Zometa was stopped for
concern of right lower jaw osteonecrosis. Mr. [**Known lastname 4460**] was off all
therapy for his myeloma since that time. Bone marrow biopsy done
on [**2152-10-30**] showed a marrow cellularity of 28-30%,
interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring singly and in
clusters. By CD138 immunohistochemical staining, plasma cells
were 5-10% of marrow cellularity. Kappa restricted. He started a
Decadron burst on [**2152-11-15**]. After this first cycle of Decadron
he developed an infection in his mouth and lower extremity
weakness so he did not start his second cycle until [**12-19**]. He
started cycle 1 Velcade on [**2153-1-30**]. He had radiation to the
T11-L3 spine given 300 x 8 fractions for a total of 2400 cGy
from [**2-14**] to [**2153-2-23**].  He started cycle 2 Velcade on
[**2153-3-6**] - he received 2 doses but the rest was held due to
shortness of breath and weakness. He started cycle 3 on [**2153-4-17**].
This course was complicated by a hospitalization for EColi
sepsis with unclear source. EMG showed diffuse complicated
neuropathy. The Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] Proteins in his urine were
negligible since he received his last cycle of Velcade until
[**7-21**] when they again begain to rise. His FLR also began to rise
at that time. As his UPEP began to double and FLR rose, the
decision was made to start him on Revlimid. He started Revlimid
5 mg weekly x 1 wk, 10 mg weekly x 1 wk, 15 mg weekly x 1wk for
21/28 days in [**11-20**].

IMAGING
CXR [**6-12**]: Subtle opacities in the lower lungs compatible with
multifocal
pneumonia.

CXR [**6-15**]: There is unchanged borderline cardiomegaly.  There is
some improvement of the airspace opacities within the right base
which may represent prior improved atelectasis or early
infiltrate.  There remains a left retrocardiac opacity and
likely [**Known lastname **] bilateral pleural effusions.  There are no signs
for overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothoraces are identified.
