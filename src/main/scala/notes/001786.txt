History of Present Illness:
71M with a history of venous stasis ulcers and bilateral lower
extremity ischemia had a recent right lower angio w/ AT stent
[**2194-4-11**]. On the same admission the patient had a Right 4th toe
open ray amputation [**4-13**] complicated by sepsis that resolved
with a VAC dressing. The patient was discharged home on PO
augmentin for unspeciated mixed wound flora. The plan was for
the patient to return to the hospital for a  repeat
angio/possible Right TMA.  He then returned to [**Location **] from his rehab
facility on [**2194-4-25**] with slurred speech and a non-productive
cough. A CXR demonstrated volume overload associated
with decreased oxygen sats.

[**2194-5-5**]
INDICATION: 71-year-old male with end-stage renal disease,
admitted [**2194-4-25**]
with mental status changes and dysarthria. Evaluate for evidence
of evolving
infarct.

COMPARISON: [**2194-4-25**] and [**2194-1-26**].

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:

There is little change compared to prior studies. There is no CT
evidence of
acute or evolving subacute territorial infarct. Periventricular
and
subcortical white matter hypodensities are again seen,
compatible with chronic
small vessel infarcts, most discrete in the in the right
thalamus and left
corona radiata/centrum semiovale. There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage
or mass effect, including no shift of midline structures or
effacement of the
basal cisterns. Mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci
suggests global
volume loss. The bones remain unremarkable. There is a small
mucus retention
cyst in the imaged portion of the left maxillary sinus,
incompletely
visualized. There are extensive arterial calcifications.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute intracranial process,
including no CT
evidence for an evolving acute or subacute infarct. Grossly
unchanged chronic
small vessel infarcts.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

and

Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO/PAIN: Upon admission, Neurology was initially consulted
regarding concern for sepsis and infectious encephalopathy. They
recommended a head CT on [**4-25**] which showed no evidence of acute
intracranial process. The patient was closely monitored with
stable neurologic exams. A repeat head CT was obtained for
follow-up, after transfer from the ICU, which was deemed stable
and without intracranial process. The patient was maintained on
IV pain medication in the immediate post-operative period and
transitioned to PO narcotic medication with adequate pain
control on POD#[**1-30**]. The patient remained neurologically intact
and without change from baseline during their stay. The patient
remained alert and oriented to person, location and place.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient remained hemodynamically stable
intra-op and in the immediate post-operative period. Their
vitals signs were closely monitored with telemetry. The
patient's home statin medication was continued. Patient had a
previous right 4th toe amputation on [**4-13**] and on this admission,
presented with concern for sepsis requiring ICU admission and
minimal pressor support transiently during dialysis sessions. On
[**2194-4-29**] he was taken for right lower extremity angiography and
eventually a TMA amputatio
