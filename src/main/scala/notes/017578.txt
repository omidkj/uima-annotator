History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 62558**] is a 46 year-old male with a history of HIV who
initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2178-1-13**] with SOB and nonbloody
diarrhea and a CD4 count of 19 (pt off HAART for 1.5 year).
Since admission he has been diagnosed with PCP (from BAL [**1-16**]
treated with bactrim and steroid taper), Giardia (finished
flaygl [**1-23**] with no residual diarrhea), KS with pulmonary
involvement(treated with Paclitaxel and high dose steroids on
[**1-20**]), thrush, HSV type II (lesion on left chin), and CMV
pnuemonitis growing from [**1-16**] BAL, as well as CMV bacteremia
(treated with gancyclovir). He also developed recurrent Hep B
infection and therefore was started on HAART therapy [**1-22**]
despite active PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 90417**] hospital course is
also notable for developing bilateral apical pneumothoraces and
is s/p chest tube placement by IP.  The Chest tube has since
been pulled [**1-28**] and his bilateral pneumothoraces were stable by
radiology report.  However, also developed pneumomediastinum
which was present on [**1-27**] then dissappeared on [**1-30**] and now
present and worse on today's film.  He also developed tachypnea
and hypoxia and was diagnosed with hospital acquired PNA and was
started on vanc/zosyn on [**1-30**].  Finally, his course has also been
c/b SIADH.
.
This morning Mr. [**Known lastname 62558**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7600**] for increasing oxygen
requirement.  Per primary team, the pt has been stable on the
floor with O2 sats in the high 80s to low 90s on 5 L nc during
this hospitalization.  This morning an NGT was placed for
nutrition given pt very malnourished and he was noted to be more
hypoxic.  The NGT was removed and patient continued to have
decreasing O2 sats.  He was somnolent and transiently not
oriented to place.  He was placed on venturi mask and nasal
canula and his sats remained in the mid to low 80s.  He was
tachypneic and complained of air hunger.  He was pale on exam,
with poor air movement but otherwise no rhonchi or rhales.
Patient was placed on NRB and O2 sas improved to 92%.  ABG at
this time revealed 7.4/32/51.  He was then transferred to ICU.
.
In the ICU, patient was placed on nc with nonrebreather on hi
Flow.  His O2 sats remained 89-90% despite this and he was
tachypneic to mid 30s.  He was somnolent but oriented x 3.
Patient had no other complaints at that time.

Kaposi's Sarcoma - Skin, right scalp (A):

Dermal vascular proliferation consistent with Kaposi's sarcoma,
extending to the specimen margins (see note).

CT Torso:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse ground-glass pulmonary infiltration, favoring the
central lungs
with a reticular pattern that suggests an acute-on-chronic
infection
consistent with pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. These findings
are not
characteristic of mycoplasma avium intracellulare infection.

2. Wedge-shaped hypodensity within the left kidney. This is most

characteristic of a renal infarct; however, differential
diagnosis includes
focal pyelonephritis and correlation with urinalysis is
suggested.

3. No appreciable lymphadenopathy.

CXR [**1-16**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-described
parenchymal opacities at both lung bases and in the periphery of
the left
hilus are unchanged in severity and distribution. There is no
evidence of
pneumothorax. No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.

[**1-13**]: FINDINGS: There are ill-defined patchy opacities in the
lung bases
bilaterally, right greater than left. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural
effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Ill-defined patchy bibasilar opacities, concerning
for infectious process. Given clinical context, pneumocystis
pneumonia not excluded.
