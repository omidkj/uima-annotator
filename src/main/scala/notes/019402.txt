CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2191-1-15**] 4:51 PM
Right subclavian line within the mid right atrium. No
pneumothorax or pleural effusion identified. Otherwise stable
exam when compared to previous studies from the same day.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2191-1-17**] 9:19 AM
Chronic bilateral lung process without significant interval
change since previous examination. Correction of central venous
line position has been performed.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Failure: Pt well-known to pulmonary clinic, has
baseline ILD/COPD with baseline pCO2 50.  Pt was initially
started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including Zosyn, Levo,
Vanco, Azithro, and inhaled Tobra for her history of multiple
colonies of multi-drug resistent pseudomonas, atypicals, and
MRSA (given recent hospitalizations).  Multiple sputum cultures
grew back Pseudomonas sensitive to everything but gent, and as
she had demonstrated clinical improvement on the zosyn, she was
continued on this and everything else was stopped. Despite her
extremely restrictive lung physiology, she was weaned off the
ventilator following diuresis to even I/O's for her ICU stay.
She was continued on Zosyn for 10 days, as well as
Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs, chest PT.  She was restarted on
Mucomyst nebulizers.  Her respiratory status continued to
improve.  She was determined to be stable and discharged to
pulmonary rehab.
*
2. Hypotension/sepsis: Pt was started on the MUST protocol for
presumed sepsis, which included a negative response to [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim
test--started on hydrocortisone/fludrocortisone, as well as
being started on pressors and intially xigris (although this was
discontinued due to a decrease in Hct) Her blood pressure
gradually improved and she was weaned off of pressors.
Eventually, her blood pressure fully recovered and she was
started on an ACEI and diuresed back to her admission fluid
level.  She was discharged on all of her pre-admission HTN
medications.
*
3. ARF: FENa demonstrated a pre-renal etiology, and the Cr
eventually returned to baseline with IVFs. Antibiotics were
initially renal-dosed, but with improved renal function, were
dosed
