Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Change in mental status, right sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2156-6-12**]
Left ICA stenting, followed by IA t-PA, and clot
retrieval using the Merci & Penumbra devices.

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 62 yo male with a history of hypertension,
ulcerative colitis, and mild depression who presents with
decreased responsiveness and R hemiparesis consistent with L MCA
stroke. The patient was last seen normal at 9:30 am on the day
of
admission. He was found by his wife at 10:30 am on the day of
admission, on the floor laying on his side and incontinent of
urine. His wife reported that he was nonverbal, but it was
unclear if there was any focal weakness at this time. Per his
wife, 1 week prior to admission he had an episode of left sided
blurry vision.
.
EMS was called and took him to [**Hospital6 33**] ED, and was
intubated for altered mental status and given Lidocaine 50,
Etomidate 20, Succs 80, Versed 2, Vecuronium 5 IV x2, and Ativan
1 gm IV x1. Neuro exam at the OSH (11:20 am) showed the patient
was intubated, squeezed left hand to command, R CN VII paresis,
motor [**4-5**] of left arm and leg, [**2-4**] R leg at the thigh but cannot
elevate the right heel off the bed. 0/5 R arm movement. Planter
reflex was down. CT Head at OSH showed hyperdensity involving
the
left MCA, no evidence of ICH, and subtle hypodensity involving
the left cerebral hemisphere consistent with infarction.
Incidental note was also made of an 8 mm hyperdense focus
anterior to the sella which is suspicious for an aneurysm of the
anterior communicating artery. It was determined that he was not
an IV tPA candidate because of likely seizure at the onset, and
he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Patient arrived to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED and CODE STROKE was called at
1:57pm. Neurology was at the bedside within 5 minutes. NIHSS was
21 - for LOC, motor arm and leg, aphasia. Examination was
limited
by medications and intubation. CT Head showed occlusion of left
carotid and left MCA at origin, and hypodensity of left cerebral
hemisphere. CT Perfusion showed decreased blood volume and
increased mean transit time, with mismatch between the images.
The family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and consented, and the patient was
taken
to the angiography lab for IA tPA and Merci cath/Penumbra.
