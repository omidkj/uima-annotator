Living related kidney transplant.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with type 1 diabetes, who is
12 years out from a living related kidney transplant that has
gradually deteriorated over the past decade.  He underwent a
pancreas-after-kidney transplant in [**2122**] that was complicated by
a ventral hernia that required repair with a mesh. He has a
brother, who does want to serve as a donor, and he presents for
donation. [**Known firstname **] has completed his workup and has no
contraindications to proceeding with the transplantation.
Reportedly, the kidney is on the right side and the pancreas is
on the left. We would likely proceed with the placement of the
kidney on the right side via probably an intra-abdominal
approach. His pre-transplant workup includes a colonoscopy in
[**2126-12-26**] that was unremarkable. A [**Year (4 digits) **] echo
demonstrated no evidence of ischemia. Cardiac echo showed normal
left ventricular function.

well post-operatively, producing 300-400cc/hr of urine

47 and his creatinine was 5.3.  On [**2127-2-9**], the patient's BUN
was 11, and his creatinine was 1.4.  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital

Zosyn.  He responded well to the antibiotics, and was
subsequently transferred back to the transplant floor were re

Discharge Instructions:
Please follow directions as discussed previously by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **]/Transplant Coordinator.

Please take medications as prescribed and read warning labels
carefully.  If signs of infections such as fever greater than
101.4 F, purulent discharge from wound, increased pain and
redness at wound site, please call or go to the emergency room.
If you experience difficulty urinating, pain with urination,
icreased pain at transplanted kidney site, please call or go to
the emergency room.  Remember to call for a follow up
appointment (bellow) and have lab checks twice a week or
directed by attending surgeon/transplant coordinator.  Light
activities until seen in clinic.  [**Month (only) 116**] sponge bathe or take
shower if shower hose can be directed to minimize getting wound
and drains wet.  No baths.  If you still have staples, they will
be addressed during your follow up visit.  If you have
steri-strips, do not peel them off--it may take off the scab.
Trim the edges if necessary.  Otherwise, they will fall off on
their own after about a week.  Absolutely no smoking because
tobacco will slow/inhibit wound healing.

Remember to go and check your blood twice a week, as discussed
by the Transplant Coordinator.
