History of Present Illness:
46 yo F w/ EtOH cirrohsis, h/o admissions for alcohol
withdrawals, celiac disease, hypothyroidism and chronic anemia
p/w dizziness x 7-8 days. Patient had large amounts of melena on
sunday and monday. She them progressively felt dizzy over the
week and she presented today to the ED. Also, she had a
mechanical fall on [**2115-8-22**] on her face for which she presented
to an OSH. No imaging was performed then.
.
In the ED, her VS were T 97.8, HR 72, BP 90/50, RR 18 and O2 sat
100% on RA. Her Hct came back at 10.4 (baseline around 25) . 2
PIV were placed, she was given 2L IVF, started on octreotide
drip and admitted to MICU for emergency EGD.
.
Pt was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] ([**Date range (3) 13481**]) for fatigue
and was worked up extensively for liver failure (admission ALT
22, AST 179, Alk phos 162, total bili 5.8), inc. liver biopsy
which showed high likelihood of ETOH hepatitis. Pt was treated
with lasix/aldactone, nadolol, vitamin supplements, and a course
of pentoxifylline. She is being followed by liver clinic. Pt was
also extensively worked up for anemia (admission hct 17.8). Heme
was consulted on the pt and felt it was multifactorial, inc.
ETOH suppression, hypothyroidism, celiac/nutritional deficiency.
Pt was treated with PRBCs and B12/folate/iron supplementation.
EGD/colonoscopy during the admission showed grade I non-bleeding
esophageal varices and rectal varices, and pt was placed on
nadolol. She did have 1 episode of BRBPR. She had another
admission for BRBPR from [**Date range (1) 13482**] with stable hct. She was
seen by Liver and was felt to be stable compared to previous
admission in [**2115-1-31**]. A RUQ ultrasound showed no portal HTN.
She received her outpatient doses of Lasix and spironolactone.
Ammonia levels were followed and were as high as 128; however,
pt remained oriented (though lethargic on day of admission from
lorazepam for ETOH withdrawal) without asterixis. Pt was started
on lactulose.

Liver U/S [**2115-6-25**]
1. Coarsened nodular liver consistent with chronic liver
disease.
2. Thick-walled gallbladder with sludge and gallstones also
consistent with
chronic liver disease.
3. Normal arterial and venous waveforms of the hepatic
vasculature.
.
CT Head [**2115-8-29**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
ECG [**2115-8-29**]:
Baseline artifact. Probable sinus rhythm. Leftward axis. Low
precordial voltage. Q-T interval prolonged for the rate. ST-T
wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2115-2-3**] the QRS
voltage has decreased.
.
EGD [**2115-8-29**]:
Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus.
Granularity and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach
compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy.
Varices at the fundus.
.
Colonoscopy [**2115-8-30**]:
Granularity, petechiae and congestion in the whole colon
compatible with portal hypertensive colopathy.
Large rectal varices.

Abd U/S [**2115-8-30**]:
1. Patent portal veins.
2. Cholelithiasis and sludge.

(LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The

IMPRESSION:
1. Patent TIPS with appropriate direction of flow and unchanged
velocities.
2. Hepatic cirrhosis without masses identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) GIB: Originally presented with HCT of 10 in the setting of
esophageal variceal bleed.  A total of 7 units of PRBC were
transfused in the MICU. EGD did not show source of bleeding with
some gastritis and varices. Patient was maintained on octreotide
drip and received a 3-day course of ceftriaxone for SBP
prophylaxis. The day after admission patient underwent a
colonoscopy that showed portal hypertensive colopathy, large
recta varices and blood in rectum.   In the MICU, a total of 7
units of PRBC were transfused. EGD did not show source of
bleeding with some gastritis and varices.  She underwent TIPS on
[**2115-9-3**].  She was started on midodrine as well as diazepam per
CIWA scale (did not require any during the first three days of
admission).  Her acute renal failure slowly improved with
transfusions and IV fluid bolusus as needed.  She was then
transfered to hepatorenal service with a hematocrit of 24.9.  On
the floor, she was noted to be progressively anemic and
continued to lose blood.  She was found to have an
pseudoaneurysmal bleed and was mangaged with transfusions of FFP
and pRBCs until she became hypotensive with a Hct of 16.  She
was then transferred back to the MICU where she underwent R
hepatic artery embolization with coiling and then glue. She then
went for exploratory lap on [**2115-9-14**]
