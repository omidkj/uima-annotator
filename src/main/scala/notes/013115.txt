History of Present Illness:
This is a 38 yo G3P1021 s/p radical hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy on [**2171-10-15**] for
Stage Ib1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the cervix, s/p 6
cycles
of cisplatin and pelvic radiation for involvement of two
regional
lymph nodes, who presented with vaginal bleeding. A Pap smear
and
biopsy of a right vaginal apex thickening on [**2172-5-21**] revealed
recurrent adenocarcinoma. A PET CT [**2172-5-29**] showed no evidence of
metastatic disease. Tumor Board recommendation on [**2172-6-12**] was
for
total pelvic exenteration.


Past Medical History:
cervical CA s/p exploratory laparotomy, radical hysterectomy,
bilateral salpingoopherectomy and lymph node dissection [**10/2171**],
s/p cisplatin/pelvic radiation; chronic back pain; breast
reduction 3/[**2169**].

Social History:
Denies T/E/D


Family History:
Significant for a father with [**Name (NI) 5668**] cell carcinoma and a
maternal grandmother with breast and brain cancer.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2172-6-25**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy,
periaortic lymph node sampling, supralevator total pelvic
exenteration, low rectal anastomosis, J-flap omentopexy,
transverse loop colostomy, ileal urinary conduit by the urology
service and colonic neovagina reconstruction by plastic surgery
service. Significant findings included an isolated lesion in R
cuff and negative periaortic nodes. As described in the
operative note, the ileal urinary conduit was redone due to
ischemic bowel. At the end of the case, the bowel was
significantly edematous and prevented primary fascial closure.

Pt was brought to the ICU intubated for postop reovery. She went
into septic shock on POD#2, with multiple system failure
including liver, heme, and cardiac (see systems list). Her
antibiotic coverage was changed to cefetime, vancomycin,
levofloxacin, metronidazole and fluconazole. She was started on
activated protein C from [**Date range (1) 92378**]. Pt was brought back to the
OR on POD3 for re-exploration. Findings were significant for a
small leak in the left ureteral-ileal conduit junction, but no
collections, abscess or ischemic bowel was found. Infectious
disease and general surgery was consulted. Cultures returned
with E. Coli in her peritoneal fluid; her sputum also yielded E.
Coli and Serratia. The pt, however, remained persistently
febrile. Multiple cultures returned with no growth (bacterial or
fungal) after [**6-27**]; a RUQ ultrasound and HIDA scan were neg for
collections. Multiple CT torso scans showed sinusitis (cx by ENT
was negative), possible fungal ball vs collection in the R renal
collecting system (f/u renal U/S was negative); echocardiogram
was negative for vegetations. Per ID, aspergillus antigen and
beta glucan was drawn. Aspergillus was negative but the beta
glucan was moderately positive. This was repeated and returned
as mildly positive. Re-exploration for partial abdominal closure
on [**7-7**] and re-exploration total closure on [**7-18**] also yielded no
significant collections. Pleural effusions were tapped [**2172-7-15**]
with no bacterial growth. She continued on her antibiotics until
[**7-21**], which were discontinued due to negative cultures. Her fever
curve and WBC slowly improved. A pigtail catheter was placed
[**7-29**] to drain a pelvic collection seen on CT, which also yielded
negative cultures. She had a brief period of no fevers from [**7-30**]
to [**8-1**]. She had another elevated temp on [**8-1**] and the source
was found to be Klebsiella pyelonephritis in the left kidney.
She was started on levofloxacin and a percutaneous nephrostomy
tube placed. Pt's WBC decreased and she defervesed.  However,
she developed an aspergillus infection of her wound. She was
started on Voriconazole on [**8-18**] and topical terbinafine. While on
the floor she continued to spike fevers and found to have an
enterococcus pelvic abscess. On [**8-25**] CT-guided drainage of the
pelvic collection yielded 8 cc of purulent fluid. On [**8-27**]
vancomycin was started. Repeat CT of pelvis on [**9-14**] showed
decreased size of fluid collection. Given pt was afebrile and
clinically improving, this fluid was not drained. She will
continue on vancomycin until appointment with infectious disease
on [**9-29**]. On [**9-3**] urine culture grew Serratia. Per ID
recommendations, ceftriaxone was started. Repeat urine culture
on [**9-7**] was [**Last Name (un) **] positive for Serratia. Urine culture on [**9-10**]
showed no growth. She will continue on ceftriaxone for a total
of 14 day course. Klebisella grew from blood cultures on [**9-3**].
Subsequent serial blood cultures showed no growth to date.

Her other issues are as follows:
1. Wound/neovagina: her fascia was partially closed with a
[**State 19827**] patch by General Surgery on [**7-7**]. The patch was
progressively rolled every 2-3 days until [**7-18**] when the fascia
was closed with mesh by general surgery. Retention sutures were
removed by POD#42 and her wound was packed with wet to dry
dressings. On [**8-17**] her wound was noted to be growing fungus,
later identified as aspergillus fumigata; ID was reconsulted and
she was started on voriconazole on [**8-18**]. The wound was managed by
 general surgery. The wound improved and a VAC was placed prior
to discharge.

Of note, her anticoagulation was halted while the [**State 19827**] patch
was in place due to bleeding. She also had a significant blood
loss after her closure on [**7-18**] that required reexploration by
general surgery, where 1 L clot was found in the subcutaneous
layer. 2 subcutaneous arterial bleeds were identified and
cauterized.
The neovagina was inspected by Plastics postoperatively and
there was a small separation near the introitus. This was
repaired on [**7-18**]. She began vaginal dilators on [**8-15**].

2. Neuro: due to the patient's septic coagulopathy, her
epidural, which was placed preoperatively, remained in place
until [**7-8**]. Pt was maintained on fentanyl and propofol gtt until
[**7-22**]. She was gradually transitioned to PO pain meds with
excellent pain control. Of note, she was noted to have decreased
gag reflex [**7-5**]. A head CT on [**7-5**] was negative for
bleed/ischemia.

3. CV: Pt required three pressors postoperatively due to septic
shock. She was weaned off pressors by POD#8. Echo [**6-29**] showed
global biventricular hypokinesis likely from sepsis, EF 20%.
Serial echos showed improvement to an EF of 50-55% on [**7-17**]. No
vegetations were noted on any of the echos. After being
transferred to the floor she was tachycardic, which was
controlled with metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **].

3. Pulm: a. PNA: sputum grew out serratia and E.Coli. Her
radiological findings improved over hospitalization. b.
Pulmonary effusions: Pt developed significant pulmonary
effusions immediatley postop, which was tapped on [**7-15**]. These
returned very quickly. CT surgery was consulted for possible U/S
guided thoracentesis, but the effusions dramatically improved
and the thoracentesis was cancelled. c. Tracheostomy: A
tracheostomy was placed by
