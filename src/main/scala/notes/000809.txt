Admission Date:  [**2140-8-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2140-8-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2065-1-7**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
woman with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital for [**7-18**]
chest pressure, facial pain, shortness of breath, and
diaphoresis after skipping her evening medications.

She was given 81 mg of aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin
times three, and 4 mg of morphine by Emergency Medical
Service in the field.  An electrocardiogram was done that
revealed ST elevations in the inferior leads.  She was given
3000 units of heparin, a nitroglycerin drip, Lasix 40 mg, and
started on Integrilin.  She was premedicated with Solu-Medrol
and Benadryl due to a suspected allergy to contrast and sent
to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization.

The patient denied any previous myocardial infarction but
states she was hospitalized once for congestive heart
failure.  A transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2139-6-26**]
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 65% with 1+ mitral
regurgitation and delayed relaxation of left ventricular
inflow.  She currently denies orthopnea and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  She has used a walker for a number of
years and currently gets short of breath with minimal
exertion.

Her current chest pressure had completely resolved upon
arrival to [**Hospital1 69**] where she was
taken straight to the catheterization laboratory.  Cardiac
catheterization showed normal left main coronary artery with
20% ostial left anterior descending artery, normal right
coronary artery, 30% proximal left circumflex, 30% first
obtuse marginal.  The obtuse marginal and left posterior
descending artery demonstrated cutoffs consistent with
embolism and spontaneous thrombolysis.  No interventions were
made.

Of note, during the cardiac catheterization the femoral
artery was unable to be cannulated, and a right radial
approach was necessary.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes.
3.  Pulmonary hypertension.
4.  Urinary incontinence.
5.  Anemia.
6.  Osteoarthritis.
7.  Hypothyroidism.
8.  Congestive heart failure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Left shoulder replacement.
2.  Varicose vein surgery.
3.  T12-L2 arthrodesis with pedicle screw fixation.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family medical history was significant for
mother who died of a myocardial infarction in her 80s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco or alcohol use.
She lives at home with her husband in [**Name (NI) 47**].  Five of
her children are living in the area.  She is a retired
receptionist.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Temperature of 98,
blood pressure of 162/82, heart rate of 81, respiratory rate
of 12, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  In general, the patient was obese and talkative, in
no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
revealed jugular venous pressure was not appreciated.  Pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  Possible 3-cm X 3-cm goiter on the
left lobe of the thyroid.  Chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally and anteriorly; unable to assess posterior lung
fields.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate.
Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  Positive
fourth heart sound.  No murmurs.  The abdomen was obese,
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Normal active bowel
sounds.  Extremities revealed 2+ pitting edema bilaterally to
the knees.  Good dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurologically, alert and oriented times three, nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed a white blood cell count of 11.9,
hemoglobin of 11.9, hematocrit of 33.9, platelets of 140.
Chemistry revealed a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.9,
chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 20, blood urea nitrogen
of 49, creatinine of 1.9, blood glucose of 23, with an anion
gap of 18.  PT of 14.8, PTT of 150, INR of 1.5.  Initial
arterial blood gas was 7.39/43/66/23.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram done on admission pain
free revealed 2-mm to 3-mm ST elevations in the inferior lead
with ST depressions in V2 through V4, aVL; all new compared
to electrocardiogram dated [**2139-6-30**].

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 76-year-old female status post
inferior myocardial infarction with spontaneous thrombolysis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:  The
patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and was
started on aspirin, Plavix, Integrilin drip, and Lipitor.
The Integrilin drip was stopped prematurely, approximately
eight hours after staring, status post catheterization due to
concern over bleeding from central venous site as well as a
femoral sheath.

Cardiac enzymes were cycled and showed a peak creatine
phosphokinase at 7 a.m. after admission at 1306, CK/MB of 84,
and an index of 6.4, with a troponin of greater than 50.  All
cardiac enzyme markers trended downward for the remainder of
the hospital course.

Lipids were checked on hospital day four, and the patient was
found to have an low-density lipoprotein of 95; and therefore
Lipitor was stopped.

(b)  Pump:  The patient was on six antihypertensive
medications at home.  On admission, she stated she was
compliant with all.

Status post catheterization, her medications were started and
titrated up slowly, and she was discharged on an
antihypertensive regimen of metoprolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
enalapril 40 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.  The
patient's blood pressure at the time of discharge was 130/78.

A repeat echocardiogram was performed on [**2140-7-10**] which
showed an ejection fraction of 35%, hypokinesis of basal
inferolateral walls consistent with systolic dysfunction,
moderate pulmonary hypertension.

(c)  Rate and Rhythm:  The patient had a 10-beat run of
ventricular tachycardia on hospital day two; presumed due to
reperfusion.

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed
red blood cells during her hospital course for a hematocrit
fall from a hematocrit of 31 with concern over excessive
bleeding from central line sites.

3.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was started on her outpatient
regimen of glyburide 2.5 mg and a regular insulin
sliding-scale.  Synthroid 175 mcg, believed to be the correct
outpatient dose, was started.  The patient's glucose was well
controlled during her hospital course with a maximum
fingerstick not greater than 150.  No signs of hypothyroidism
were noted during her hospital course.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  On hospital day four, the patient had
four loose stools in the morning due to concern for
Clostridium difficile toxin, an assay was sent which came
back negative.  The patient's diarrhea resolved by hospital
day five.

5.  REHABILITATION:  The patient was seen and evaluated by
Physical Therapy who believed that the patient was back to
baseline and safe for discharge back to home.  The patient's
family did not feel it was necessary for [**First Name (Titles) 1587**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] nurse assistance at this time.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was much
improved and stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Metoprolol 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Enalapril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. (times 30 days).
6.  Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Synthroid 175 mcg p.o. q.d.
8.  Paxil 20 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Diabetes.
2.  Hypothyroidism.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Acute inferior myocardial infarction.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
