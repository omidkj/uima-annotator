History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 56 year-old left-handed woman with a past
medical history significant for hyperlipidemia, COPD, and newly
discovered Afib who is transferred for managment of a suspected
basilar artery thrombosis. The patient was in her usual state of
health until noontime on [**2142-7-21**] (two days prior to presentation
here) when while driving she coughed and suddenly became
extremly
vertiginous, with wgat she saw spinning from left to right. She
was nauseated and vomited. EMS was contact[**Name (NI) **] and she was taken
to
[**Hospital6 204**]. There she was found to have severe
vertigo with movement and exacerbated with her eyes closed. On
exam there it is documented that she had right beating
nystagmus,
past pointing on the right, and an inability to ambulate. Her
admission vital signs included a heart rate of 73 and a blood
pressure of 147/67. She was subsequently found to be in atrial
fibrillation. Serial imaging studies demonstrated a right
cerebellar infarct. Vascular studies including MRA and CTA were
significant for a basilar artery thrombosis. She was being
treated with therapeutic lovenox (90mg [**Hospital1 **]) and aspirin (325
daily). She was also found to have a UTI and was started on
levofloxacin (uncertain start date). She is transferred now for
further management.


She now no longer has vertigo when she closes her eyes, but does
feel it when she sits up in bed or tries to ambulate. She
reports
being wholly unable to ambulate. She no longer has nausea or
vomiting, but does have a bifrontal/bioccipital headache. The
headache is a pressure like sensation. She denied any pulsation.
She denied diplopia or double vision.



ROS
On ROS she acknowledges longstanding bilateral hip numbnesses
that is unchanged from baseline. She has a baseline cough that
she attributes to a "smokers" cough.


The patient denied visual difficulty, hearing changes,
difficulty
speaking, language problems, memory difficulty, difficulty
swallowing, sensory loss, weakness, or falls.


The patient denied fever, wt loss, appetite changes, cp,
palpitations, DOE, sob, wheeze, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
