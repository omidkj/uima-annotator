[**8-23**] CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. Patchy ground-glass opacities throughout both lungs, with
neighboring
prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, is compatible with an
inflammatory process.
An atypical or viral pneumonia is a strong consideration.
Pulmonary
hemorrhage can have a similar appearance in the appropriate
clinical context.
2. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent
compressive
atelectasis.
3. No PE detected to the subsegmental levels.

[**8-25**] TTE

The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. There is
no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic
function. The right ventricle is not well seen but is probably
mildly dilated. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.

[**2155-8-25**] 10:39AM BLOOD BLASTOMYCOSIS ANTIBODY (BY CF AND ID)-PND

Brief Hospital Course:
48 F h/o DM1 with pedal neuropathy, hypothyroidism, LLE
cellulitis, C diff, presenting with nausea, vomiting and ARF.

# Atypical PNA: The patient was found to have bilateral ground
glass opacities on admission CXR and required 70% O2 to maintain
saturations > 93%, for which she was sent to the ICU. She
clinically and symptomatically improved on Levofloxacin, with O2
requirement decreasing to 2L to maintain saturations in the
mid-90s and CXR showing interval improvement on transfer to the
medical floor compared to admission. It was also thought that
hypoxia and symptoms could be due a component of [**Last Name (LF) 105496**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] viral
and fungal studies were sent; her improvement without steroids
argued against these etiologies. Beta-glucan was negative;
blastomycosis was still pending at the time of discharge. She
completed a 7 day course of Levofloxacin and will complete a 10
day course Vancomycin. She was on room air with no respiratory
complaints for over 72 hours prior to discharge.

# Decompensated CHF: A component of her hypoxia was thought to
be due to decompensated CHF, although ECHO as detailed in the
pertinent results was not suggestive of diastolic failure. She
was diuresed during her ICU stay and showed symptomatic
improvement and decreased pulmonary effusion on CXR. Lasix was
discontinued on [**2155-8-30**], but given an increase in lower
extremity edema she was re-started on Lasix 20mg PO daily with
instructions to weigh herself each morning and administer one
dose of Lasix 20mg if her weight increases 2 pounds above her
baseline or if she notes significantly increased lower extremity
edema.

# Acute renal failure: Likely due to intravascular volume
depletion from nausea with vomiting. Medications were renally
dosed and creatinine quickly normalized to baseline with
intravascular repletion.

# Nausea and vomiting, poor PO intake: Likely due to infection
+/- antibiotics. Managed symptomatically with ondansetron 4 mg
IV q4h prn.  Flagyl changed to PO vanco on [**8-29**]; stool studies
were negative. Her oral intake improved significantly prior to
discharge.

# Cellulitis Diabetic foot ulcers: Non-limb threatening
infection in a diabetic with complications and history of
osteomyelitis. Covered broadly with IV vancomycin and Flagyl for
gram + and anaerobic microbes. She will complete the final three
doses of Vancomycin as an outpatient.

# Clostridium difficile: Initially treated with metronidazole
500 mg po TID.  Changed to PO Vanco due to abdominal symptoms on
[**8-29**]. Repeat stool studies [**8-29**] were negative. She will complete
14 days of PO Vancomycin following completion of Levofloxacin,
the last dose of which was given [**2155-8-30**].

# Diabetes mellitus, type 1: Blood sugars were treated by the
patient through adjustments of her insulin pump and a sliding
scale for coverage [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations. She had elevated
sugars during the 24 hours prior to discharge as her diet was
advanced, which she managed to good effect.

# Elevated alkaline phosphatase: Noted three days prior to
admission; GGT also elevated, suggesting a hepatic source. Cause
unclear, but thought to potentially be related to re-feeding.
Alk phos peaked in the low 200's on [**2155-8-31**], and decreased to
140 on [**2155-9-1**].

# Leukopenia: Stable for four days prior to discharge, thought
to be secondary to inflammatory/infectious processes. Would
recommend a repeat check one week after discharge.

Medications on Admission:
1. Bactrim DS 800-160
