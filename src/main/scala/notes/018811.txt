HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 58850**] is a 63-year-old
male with a known history of coronary artery disease, status
post a silent myocardial infarction in [**2143**], who presented to
[**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital Emergency Department this morning with
8/10 chest pain, epigastric distress, nausea, and shortness
of breath.  He had ST depressions laterally and ST elevations
in V1.  These resolved with intravenous nitroglycerin and
Lopressor in the Emergency Department.

He was taken for cardiac catheterization which revealed 3
plus calcified LAD with a 95 percent proximal occlusion, a 70
to 80 percent proximal circumflex lesion, and 100 percent
occluded RCA with collaterals.  Echocardiogram revealed 1 to
2 plus mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation,
and an left ventricular ejection fraction of 30 percent.  He
was placed on intravenous Integrilin and transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for coronary artery bypass
grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Myocardial infarction.
3. Hypertension.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Sleep apnea (with BiPAP).
6. Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with two
   endovascular stents followed by surgical repair with a
   questionable open bypass of the left femoral artery in
   [**2152-2-28**] at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital.
7. Status post carpal tunnel repair in [**2152-10-30**] with
   a brief period of postoperative atrial fibrillation.  The
   patient admits to not taking his medications at that time.
   He was treated with Coumadin for one month without further
   atrial fibrillation.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking nine years ago.  He
had an 80-pack-year history.  He admitted for four to six
beers a day for significant alcohol abuse.  He is married and
lives with his wife and works as a plant manager.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Atenolol 100 mg p.o. once daily,
Lipitor 40 mg p.o. once daily, aspirin 325 mg p.o. once
daily, vitamin D, and fifth medicine is unclear.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  At [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital he was
started on intravenous Integrilin, Lopressor, aspirin,
heparin, intravenous nitroglycerin, and antacids.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Neurologically, he was
grossly intact without any carotid bruits.  His lungs had a
few bibasilar crackles.  His heart was regular in rate and
rhythm with S1 and S2.  No murmurs noted.  His abdomen was
slightly firm, distended, and nontender.  His extremities
were warm without any edema with positive peripheral pulses.

SU[**Last Name (STitle) 42242**]OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was referred to Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on intravenous Integrilin, nitroglycerin,
and heparin.  He had epigastric discomfort since his
admission which was increasing.  Intravenous nitroglycerin
was also increased.  This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
and an emergent Cardiology consultation was ordered, but the
patient continued to have chest pain.  He was seen by a
cardiologist.  He continued to have chest pain.  It was
determined the patient was unable to have an intraaortic
balloon pump  placed for his continuing chest pain due to his
three endovascular stents.

The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16646**] of Cardiology when he was
admitted. Preoperative laboratories were as follows.  Sodium
was 137, potassium was 3.5, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was
30, blood urea nitrogen was 11, creatinine was 0.7, with a
blood sugar of 165.  White count was 12.3, hematocrit was
42.9, and platelet count was 204,000.  CK's went from 125 to
284 to 725 with troponin's from less than 0.04 to 1.75 to
3.38; ruling the patient in for a significant myocardial
infarction.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was taken to the Operating Room emergently that
evening and underwent emergent coronary artery bypass
grafting times three with a LIMA to the LAD, a vein graft to
the PDA, and a vein graft to the OM by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  He
was taken to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in
critical condition on an epinephrine drip at 0.05 mcg/kg/min,
a nitroglycerin drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, a titrated propofol
drip, and a Neo-Synephrine drip at 1 mcg/kg/min.

In the immediate postoperative period the patient developed
several problems.  The first was atrial fibrillation which
was treated with an amiodarone bolus and started on an
intravenous drip.  He ultimately required cardioversion by
anesthesia and then later repeat cardioversion by
Electrophysiology.  The second significant incident was the
patient's liver function tests rose dramatically given his
significant alcohol abuse.  A Critical Care consultation was
also called.  The patient was clearly undergoing alcohol
withdrawal and developed delirium tremens.  He was continued
on amiodarone. Within a day or two he was also seen by the
Clinical Nutrition team as the Critical Care team was
evaluating his nutritional status and liver function.  He
remained in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit all that
week.

On [**1-12**], he continued with an inability to wean from
the respirator.  He developed atelectasis which was apparent
on his chest x-ray and significant copious secretions.  He
was awake and was on CPAP with pressure support but continued
to require significant pulmonary toilet and was unable to
wean from the ventilator.  Given these secretions, blood
cultures were also sent in addition to sputum cultures.  An
evaluation by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of the Critical Care Pulmonary
Service was obtained.  The patient's blood cultures grew out
gram-positive cocci and sputum secretions grew out coagulase-
positive Staphylococcus.  The patient was started empirically
the next day on vancomycin, Levaquin, and fluconazole.

An Infectious Disease consultation was called.  The patient
was seen by Infectious Disease on [**1-13**].  Please refer
to their official consultation note.  In addition, the
patient remained on amiodarone, digoxin, and was started on
carvedilol  for beta blockade and management of his atrial
fibrillation which continued to be an issue.  Clearly, given
his respiratory failure, there was great concern about the
process going on in his lungs.  When the cultures came back,
the sensitivities showed a sensitivity to oxacillin.  The
bronchoscopy secretion and alveolar lavage which was done by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Blood cultures showed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus that came back on [**1-13**].  The patient was changed
over.  His vancomycin, levofloxacin, and fluconazole were
stopped given the lack of sensitivities to his bacteria, and
he was switched to intravenous oxacillin.

The patient was also initially evaluated by Physical Therapy.
He had again failed an extubation wean; again failed in his
ability to attempt to wean for extubation on [**1-12**] prior
to his bronchoscopy which necessitated a Pulmonary
consultation.  Given the fact that the patient had very
little mobility at that time, heparin was also started for
anticoagulation in preparation for Coumadin starting for
anticoagulation for his atrial fibrillation.  Additional
blood cultures and sensitivities came back, and the patient
was switched back to vancomycin approximately on [**1-20**].

On [**1-21**], he continued to markedly improve on the CPAP
and was ultimately extubated.  The patient continued to have
mental status issues with confusion and disorientation - from
which he would rapidly reorient but then become significantly
confused again.  The patient had some doses of Haldol to help
with this and continued to be dosed with Coumadin once daily
in an effort to get him anticoagulated.

Finally, on [**1-23**], the patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**]
Two.  The patient had been treated all along for his delirium
tremens and alcohol withdrawal under the dir
