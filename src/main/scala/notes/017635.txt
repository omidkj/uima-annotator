A. Admission ECG
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2168-5-16**]  3:05:26 PM


Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with
ST-T wave changes. Since the previous tracing of [**2168-1-19**]
precordial lead
QRS voltage is less prominent.

B. ECHO ([**2168-5-17**])
Pre valve deployment

Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast
is present in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with normal RV free wall
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis
(area 1.5-2.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 914**] were notified in person of
the results on [**2168-5-17**] at 930 am.

Post valve deployment

Stented aortic valve seen extending from the LVOT into the
proximal aorta. Trace to mild central aortic insufficiency
present. The peak gradient across the aortic valve is 17 mm Hg
and the mean gradient is 9 mm Hg. Mild mitral insufficiency
seen. Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were notified of the pos
