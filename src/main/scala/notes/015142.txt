History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 496**] is a 43-year-old woman with a history of
bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement 6-years-ago for aortic
insufficiency/endocarditis.  According to patient, she had been
doing well until this summer when she moved down to [**State 108**] and
noticed worsening shortness of breath.  She initially attributed
these symtpoms to humidity, but eventually returned to
[**State 350**] where she was supposedly diagnosed with a
respiratory tract infection and treated with antibiotics.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 496**] somewhat better and went to [**Location (un) **] to visit her uncle;
during this trip developed worsening shortness of breath and was
hospitalized for a CHF exacerbation.  At this time, she was told
that her "valves were failing"; she was eventually stabilized
and returned to [**State 350**], where she went to see her
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] on the day of admission.  She was
subsequently told to go to the ED for treatment of CHF
exacerbation. Ms. [**Known lastname 496**] complains of progressive dyspnea
since this summer, worse in the last month.  She cannot think of
any precipitating event.  She endorses symptoms of orthopnea,
cough, and hemoptysis.  She states that she has had some fever
and chills for the past week, though hadn't taken her
temperature.  Ms. [**Known lastname 496**] reports that she hasn't been taking
her medications as she ran out of them in [**State 108**]. On further
review of systems, patient denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

[**2180-11-1**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
no significant coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was normal
without angiographically apparent coronary disease.  The LAD was
normal.  The  LCx was normal.  The RCA was normal.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left
sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 40 mmHg and low central
aortic pressures 66/47 with a mean of 57 mmHg.  There was severe
aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 97 mmHg.
3. Supravalvular aortography revealed 3+ aortic regurgitation.
4. A 30 cc IABP was inserted via the left femoral artery with
satisfactory augmentation

[**2180-11-2**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate
to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric directed jet of
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: On Milrinone, epinephrine, vasopressin, levophed,
IABP
Mild global RV hypokinesis. LVEF 45%. The aortic mechanical
valve is stable, fucntioning well with a transaortic mean
gradient of 20mm of Hg. Thoracic aortic contour is intact. 2+
eccentric MR jet. Cardiac output is 5.2L/min. IABP location is
appropriate.

[**2180-11-11**] Postop ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. A bileaflet
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
[The amount of regurgitation present is normal for this
prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 43-year-old woman with a medical history significant
for aortic valve replacement 6 years ago who presented now with
signs/symptoms of acute systolic heart failure. She was admitted
under cardiology and underwent endocarditis work-up, along with
ID consult. Broad spectrum antibiotics with Vancomycin,
Cefepime, and Gentamicin were initiated. The patient was placed
on BiPAP, and given mild diuresis. Despite medical therapy, she
continued to decompensate. Anesthesia was called to intubate the
patient. She continued to clinically deteriorate and required
increased pressors. The decision was made to take the patient to
the catheterization lab. There, severe aortic stenosis with a
peak to peak gradient of 97 mm Hg was discovered. The
supravalvular aortography revealed 3+ aortic regurgitation. The
patient returned to the CCU briefly, whe
