Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, Palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Ablation for AVNRT


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 year old female with morbid obesity and no
prior cardiac history except recent cardioversion for presumed
AFib/Flutter at OSH who was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after
presenting to her Cardiologist for a routine visit in SVT.
.
She initially presented to [**Location (un) **] last Tuesday with dyspnea and
palpitations. She was thought to be in atrial fibrillation vs
flutter and cardioverted the next day. She subsequently flipped
in and out of sinus rhythm, with continued dyspnea and
lightheadedness over the next few days. She felt somewhat better
over the weekend, and was discharged on Dronedarone 400 mg PO
BID and Pradaxa 75 mg PO BID. She was unable to fill the Pradaxa
at her pharmacy the next day.
.
Her symptoms returned soon after discharge, with continued
dyspnea on exertion and intermitent palpitations. She also
described tightness in epigastric area and pain in her left
shoulder blade radiating to the head, worse with exertion.
Earlier today, she presented to her Cardiologist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**], for
a routine followup visit. She was found to be in SVT at 165 bpm.
She was sent to the [**Location (un) **] ED, where EKG at 16:47 showed atrial
flutter at 165 bpm, and EKG at 17:10 showed spontaneous
conversion to SR at 82 bpm. She was started on Heparin IV at
1600 units/hr with 7700 unit bolus and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for possible EP study and ablation.
.
In the ED, she felt relatively well except for continued dyspnea
on exertion. She denied chest pain, near syncope, or syncope.
Initial vitals were T 96.8, HR 72, BP 99/47, RR 16, and SpO2
100% on 2L. ED read of a portable CXR showed possible RUL
pneumonia. She was was started on Ceftriaxone 1000 mg IV and
Azithromycin 500 mg PO. Her Chem10 was notable for K 3.5 and Mg
1.4, and she was given Magnesium sulfate 2 grams IV. Her coags
showed PTT 120.9, and her Heparin drip was stopped. She had a
negative Troponin <0.01 and elevated BNP 2834. A Foley catheter
was placed. UA showed RBC 20 and WBC 5, but otherwise normal.
EKG was sinus rhythm at 69 bpm.
.
She was admitted to EP for possible ablation in the morning.
Vitals prior to floor transfer were T 100.3 oral, HR 77, BP
149/50, RR 26, and SpO2 100% on 2L NC. On reaching the floor,
she complained of continued dyspnea with minimal exertion, left
shoulder pain, and headache. She denied any current chest pain.
She noted that her lower extremity edema was decreased from
baseline. She did report a recent cough with sputum that turned
green today.
.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, or syncope. She
denied any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or change in bowel
habits. She denied urinary symptoms besides frequency with
Furosemide. She has a distant history of DVT. She denies any
history of stroke, TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills, or rigors. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
# ECHO - Very limited image quality. The left atrium is normal
in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function appears
mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
# CXR - IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe pneumonia superimposed on
worsening severe bilateral pulmonary edema.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 67 year old female with morbid obesity and no
prior cardiac history except recent AFib/Flutter s/p
cardioversion and recent hospitalization who was sent to the ED
after presenting to her Cardiologist for a routine visit in SVT.

.
CCU COURSE: Pt transferred to CCU following attempted ablation
procedure in which she became acutely SOB whe laying flat prior
to procedure. Found to be in CHF on exam with CXR significant
for severe pulmonary edema and RUL infiltrate concerning for
pneumonia. She was diuresed with IV lasix and put out to 80mg
and was started on azithromycin/ceftriaxone. She had two runs of
AVNRT in the unit which did not respond to adenosine 6mg
followed by 12mg but responded to IV dilt 10mg x 1. She rhythm
controlled on Diltiazem 60mg PO QID, further diuresed, and
underwent apparently successful EP ablation of arrythmogenic
focus. She was started on lisinopril for further BP control,
found to be HD stable with a residual O2 requirement of 2-4LNC
owing to fluid overload and pneumonia. She was called out to
[**Hospital1 1516**] for further workup and management.
.
# AVNRT/Fib/Flutter: Pt was cardioverted for Aflutter/Afib at
OSH before transferring here. Pt experienced multiple paroxysmal
bouts of tachycardia up to the 160s. EKG and telemerty did not
show signs of Aflutter/Afib but were suggestive of AVNRT.
Metoprolol was given for rate control but was not effective. She
was then switched to Diltiazem for rate control which seemed to
control her SVT until her procedure. She underwent ablation and
was in NSR after the procedure.  She had no further episodes of
atrial fibrillation/flutter during this admission, however due
to her new CHF her CHADS2 score is now 2, so she was discharged
on coumadin.  She al
