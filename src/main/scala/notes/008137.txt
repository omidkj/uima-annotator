STAT ADDEDNUM:

NOTE:  This addendum will include the hospital course and
disc medications and plan.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient had been on a ventilator for
respiratory failure, diuresed and weaned on the vent over two
days.  She was extubated for four hours, increased tachypnea
and increased PCO2 and then reintubated, felt to be secondary
to flash pulmonary edema.  She diuresed aggressively over the
next 10 days and extubated in the setting of tight blood
pressure and heart rate control.  She had intermittent
wheezing felt secondary to cardiac asthma, responsive to
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  Now, she is status post
extubation on the [**3-24**] and tolerating well.  Her
oxygen has been weaned down to 3 liters nasal cannula and she
has been on standing doses of Serevent and Atrovent, as well
as prn medications for wheezing.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  She had flash pulmonary edema which led
to the initial intubation, history of coronary artery disease
and congestive heart failure unclear given the patient
received majority of care in [**State 5111**].  Transthoracic
echocardiogram on [**7-12**] showed an ejection fraction greater
than 65% with 1+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ MS, 1+ AS and 1+
aortic regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension.  She
was felt to have the flash pulmonary edema secondary to
diastolic dysfunction.  She was aggressively diuresed over
the next 10 days with Lasix drip and 5.5 liters were removed
prior to extubation.  A pulmonary artery catheter guided
therapy with pulmonary capillary wedge pressures around 16.
Pulmonary artery pressures were approximately 50 to 70/25 to
30 at the time of discharge to the medical floor.  She was
extubated a second time with strict control of blood pressure
and heart rate with nitroglycerin drip, Nipride drip,
Diltiazem drip and Lasix drip.  She was weaned off drips
quickly three days prior to extubation and had increased
respiratory distress.  She is currently off all drips and
receiving Diltiazem and Isordil.  Lasix had been held because
of the increasing creatinine and will be restarted as an
outpatient.  ACE inhibitor was held also and may be restarted
at a later time when the creatinine is more stable.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Respiratory failure in the setting
of increased fevers, appeared to have a right hip cellulitis
which was treated with vancomycin and clindamycin for 10
days, resultant improvement in the erythema over the right
hip.  In addition, she was treated with a 10 day course of
Levaquin for pneumonia.  Sputum sample six days prior to
transfer to the floor grew out Acinetobacter, but the patient
was afebrile with normal white count, so it was not treated.
She has no signs of ventilator associated pneumonia and she
has been afebrile now for many days with a stable white
count.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had a nasogastric tube
placed and was given tube feeds while in the unit.
Nasogastric lavage was trace positive on Protonix.  She
received one blood transfusion, but now had a stable
hematocrit for many days.  She is currently taking po, but
needs encouragement and may need intravenous fluids if her po
improvement does not improve.

5.  RENAL:  Slightly increased BUN and creatinine on
admission secondary to dehydration.  BUN and creatinine are
stable the majority of the hospitalization, but over the past
few days had increased slightly and now appears to be
decreasing again.  Probably it had increased because of over
diuresis and now appears stable at 1.9.

6.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has -6.7
liters for the hospital course and had been on tube feeds and
is now tolerating diet well.  Suggest following patient's
weight, adjusting according to dry weight on admission to
rehabilitation.

7.  PSYCH:  The patient is anxious during hospitalization
with increased heart rate and blood pressure worsening her
diastolic dysfunction.  Prn Haldol and morphine have been
helpful.

8.  PAIN:  The patient has a history of polio and is on
OxyContin for pain relief.  She is also receiving morphine
initially and Neurontin has been added back for discharge.

CODE STATUS:  The patient was full code upon admission, but
is now DNR/DNI per the family's decision and the
communication should go through the patient's [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) **].  Her number is ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 32585**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5762**] is the primary
care physician.

She should also have physical therapy and close monitoring
