IMAGING:
KUB [**2117-1-15**]
No bowel obstruction or free air

CT ABD [**2117-1-15**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Striking fecal loading within the colon, without obstruction.

2. A focally dilated loop of small bowel in the mid abdomen
contains contrast and fecalized contents. There is also slowed
motility, though a stricture or ischemia are not excluded on
this study. Note is made on this study of atherosclerotic SMA
disease. 3. New hypodense collection anterior to the liver
measures 1.6 cm, and is new compared with 6/[**2116**]. This may be a
small postsurgical fluid collection. This is too small for
intervention. Follow up MRI or PET CT may be of utility for
further evaluation. 4. Mild ascites and mesenteric edema, which
may be reactive to relatively recent surgery. 5. The low rectal
anastomosis appears intact, without surrounding fluid collection
to suggest leak.

CT Abd [**2117-1-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Compared to the prior study, the amount of fecal loading
within the colon has improved. There are focally dilated loops
of small bowel, likely
mid-to-distal ileum, which when compared to the prior study,
appear more
dilated. 2. Again noted is atherosclerotic calcification of the
abdominal aorta, focal low-attenuation lesion in the dome of the
liver, loculated left pleural effusion. 3. Compared to the prior
study, there is increased opacity in the left lower lobe.
Findings are consistent with an inflammatory or infectious
etiology.  Aspiration should also be considered.

CXR [**2117-1-18**]
The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach and should be
advanced. Current
study demonstrates interstitial pulmonary edema, moderate in
severity. The
left mediastinal shift is unchanged. Loculated left pleural
effusion has
slightly increased in the interim. Bibasal opacities might
reflect areas of infection, although they potentially could
reflect interstitial edema as well. Evaluation of the patient
after diuresis is highly recommended.

KUB [**2117-1-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Partial small bowel obstruction which is essentially
unchanged from prior; however, the amount of retained enteric
contrast has slightly decreased. 2. Unconventional position of
an NG tube should be correlated to functioning. No findings to
suggest free air.

CXR [**2028-1-23**]
FINDINGS: Unchanged small loculated effusion on the left with
decreasing
extent of the retrocardiac atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No
newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities. Borderli
