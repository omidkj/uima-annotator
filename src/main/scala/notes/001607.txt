Allergies:
Haldol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache, fevers


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with endotracheal tube
Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 30 yo female who presented to [**Hospital3 19345**] on the day of admission for evaluation of headache,
subjective fevers. Per the original admission note, the headache
and fever had been occurring for 6 days. She also had
photophobia and intermittent nausea associated with the HAs.
Over the past 2-3 days, she had noted increasing
fatigue/malaise.

At [**Hospital3 **], she had a temp of 100.9 and a WBC was
322,000. A head CT was performed which was reportedly negative
for acute bleed/mass. A CXR showed infiltrates throughout the
lung. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was given a dose of allopurinol and
started on D5W w/ 3amps bicarb. A bm bx was done. Her peripheral
smear was reviewed and felt to be c/w blast crisis. Surgery was
called for placement of a pheresis catheter. She was given 3 gms
hydrea. Her BPs remained 80s-90s/50s-60s. As the surgeon
attempted to place the line, the patient desatted to 80% RA.
Anesthesia was paged for a stat intubation. Intubation occurred
without complication and the pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

MICU course:
[**4-2**] Pt was pheresed overnight, and WBC was reduced to approx
100/microL. Hydroxyurea was given [**Hospital1 **]. Once flowcytometry
identified [**Name (NI) 72473**], pt was started L-Asp, Cytoxan, Danarubicin,
Vincristin. PT was frequently monitored for tumor lysis
syndrome. Family was informed about poor prognosis.
[**4-3**] In the morning changed to PS 5/5, excellent RSBI. No
significant tumor lysis overnight. Clincially stable. did not
extubate as Pt. failed PS trial (ABG 7.28/51/63). Chemo day 2.

Past Medical History:
Craniotomy [**2132**] for brain tumor no chemotherapy or radiation

Social History:
She denies h/o alcohol/tobacco/IVDU. She lives with her brother
and mother. She works in a restaurant.

Family History:
No family history of blood disorder or cancer.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 72475**] is a 30 yo female with history of prior pituitary
mass s/p transphenoidal resection presenting with ALL.  Per
report: Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia CD 10+, CD 19+, CD 20+ with
some aberrant monocytic markers but not a bilineage leukemia.
She has had vision problems and per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], worrisome for CNS
involvement.

1)B-ALL with Blast crisis. The smear on presentation showed
numerous blasts associated with some metamyelocytes, myelocytes,
and bands. She also has diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and
hypoxia likely due to white thrombi. The patient was emergently
intubated, underwent plasmapheresis and started on Cytoxan,
Danarubicin, Vincristin, L-Asp on [**4-2**]. She had a marked
response, developing neutropenia. Tumor lysis labs were
monitored without significant findings. Around day +21, the
patient developed a transaminitis. Vincristine therapy was held
at this time but then completed few days prior to discharge.

2)Respiratory failure. Likely due to tumor infiltration, white
thrombi +/- HSV pneumonia vs. pneumonitis (see below). The
patient was succesfully extubated but then required
re-intubation for airway protection in the setting of declining
mental status. The patient was again succesfully extubated but
was found on ABG to be hypercarbic and acidotic. She required
intubation and was successfully extubated one day later. Chest
x-ray after extubation suggests aspiration pneumonia. Her
respiratory status remained tenuous for most of her hospital
stay likely in the setting of CHF. She was diruesed agressively
and her breathing improved significantly.

3)Febrile neutropenia. Etiology not entirely clear. The patient
had blood, urine, CSF cultures without growth to date. HSV
pneumonia (as below) was confirmed on BAL. Beta-glucan and
galactomannan were negative. The patient was initiated on broad
antibiotics, including Caspofungin, Vancomycin, Meropenem and
Acyclovir. Upon transfer out of the ICU, the patient was no
longer neutropenic and no longer febrile. She completed a 10 day
course of treatment dose (10mg/kg) IV acyclovir. She also
completed course of Vanc/Meropenem by time of discharge. Culture
data remained negative.

4)Decreased mental status. The patient developed declining
mental status in the early days of [**Month (only) 958**]. The patient had
multiple CT scans and MRI's without signs of pathology.
Specifically, the patient had no signs of intracranial bleeding
or temporal hemorrhage or enhancement (out of concern for HSV
encephalitis). The patient underwent LP with 1 WBC, 1RBC and
negative HSV PCR. Of note she underwent intrathecal methotrexate
therapy. The patient was keppra loaded out of concern for
seizure activity though quickly discontinued as EEG x2 revealed
no evidence of seizure activity, instead suggesting non-specific
encephalopathy. Given her diffusely altered mental status
without focal neurologic deficits, it was felt (in consultation
with neuro-oncology) that the patient likely had a
toxic-metabolic explanation for her symptoms. Specifically, the
patient was markedly hypophosphatemic at the time. In addition,
L-asp could have contributed. The patient's mental status
continued to wax and wane though she became more interactive. On
[**2146-4-22**] the patient underwent repeat LP. This tap was traumatic
and did not clearly show infection. HSV, HHV-6, EBV, [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] and BK
virus PCR's were sent. The fluid was also sent for regular
cul
