Chief Complaint:
s/p cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiopulmonary resuscitation

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 67870**] is a 55 year old man with unknown medical
history who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] after collapsing at work. History
was obtained through his relatives.

At 10:20 am on the day of presentation he collapsed while
working. A co-worker initiated CPR and EMS were called. He was
shocked twice at the site of collapse with AED and four times
more (200J ea) by EMS en route to [**Hospital6 17032**].
He was intubated in the field by EMS given respiratory arrest
and cyanosis.  During recussitation he was also given atropine
x4, lidocaine x2 and epinephrine x6. His rhythm at this time is
reported VF with episodes of PEA and asystole. He arrived at
[**Location (un) **] at 11:20 and he was started on lidocaine and dopanine
ggt. He was also given calcium cloride and magnesium sulfate. A
central venous line was placed in the right groin. He was
medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, and arrived here approximately at 1:00
pm. At [**Hospital1 **] he was noted to be on sinus tachycardia. No further
shocks were administered. He was continued on lidocaine ggt but
his dopamine was discontinued. His blood pressure remained
stable on this intervention. A cooling protocol was initiated
while in the ED.

In the ED CXR showed mild right hilar fullness. CT head showed
changes concerning for anoxic injury. While in the ED he
developed worsening hypotension (radial a line tracing) requring
reinitiation and uptitration of pressors. He was maxed out on
norepinephrine and dopamine.

He was thereafter taken to the cath lab where he was noted to
have clean coronaries. A preliminary v gram indicated reasonable
LV funtion. He was also noted to have a CI of 8 and his NE was
weaned. Following procedure his MAP, transduced from his fem
sheath, was in 60s and pressors were weaned.

Apparently he has a history of "palpitations" and "mild heart
attack". He's had a cath and a stress test in the past and was
told he had a "small" lesion in his coronaries. He has a brother
who passed away from a heart attack in his thirties. He is
reported to have mitral valve prolapse. Over the last several
months he has been feeling short of breath and fatigued per
family. He is currently on lipitor, amlodipine and atenolol. He
has been followed by a PCP and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cardiologist and records are
still pending.

Review of systems could not be obtained.

EKG [**10-31**]: Sinus tachycardia, rate 113. Low voltage in the
standard leads. Q wave in lead V1 and tiny R wave in leads
V2-V3. No previous tracing available for comparison. This
tracing is suspicious for an anteroseptal myocardial infarction
of indeterminate age but without acute changes on the current
tracing.
.
CT head [**10-31**]: Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation
and sulcal
effacement consistent with global cerebral edema, likely a
sequela of anoxic brain injury.
.
CTA chest [**10-31**]: 1. No aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, or
pulmonary embolus.
2. Bilateral dependent consolidations, either atelectasis or
aspiration.
3. Endotracheal tube in the right mainstem bronchus, which
should be
retracted.
4. Coronary arterial calcification.
5. Axial hiatal hernia.
6. Trace ascites.
7. Stranding and fluid about the second portion of the duodenum,
and
duodenitis is not excluded.
.
TTE [**11-1**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
EEG [**11-2**]: This telemetry captured two pushbutton activations as
described above. Routine sampling and seizure files showed a
burst
suppression pattern which was initially briefer bursts of
moderately
high voltage, mixed theta frequency with sharp features. As the
recording progressed, the bursts became longer lasting up to six
to
seven seconds and of lower amplitude and lacking sharp features.
There
were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures on this

recording.
.
CT head [**11-2**]: Significant detrimental changes consistent with
ischemic areas at the basal ganglia and head of the caudate
nuclei bilaterally with significant effacement of the sulci and
ventricles related with aggressive and significant increase in
the pattern of brain edema. Low attenuation areas are also
visualized at the convexity consistent with ischemic changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented from OSH s/p VF arrest with episodes of PEA
and asystole.  Patient had no evidence of CAD on cardiac
catherization and no EKG changes to suggest acute MI.
Echocardiogram showed depressed EF of 30-35% with global
hypokinesis.  Patient had been noted to have normal V-gram on
cardiac cath in [**2154**] per outpatient cardiologist.  This, coupled
with the history of worsening SOB, fatigue x several months
suggests that patient may have had nonischemic cardiomyopathy
(e.g. myocarditis) that led to global hypokinesis and increased
likelihood of arrhythmic events.  Long QT syndrome not supported
