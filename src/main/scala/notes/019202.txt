History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6632**] is a 60 yo man with a history HCV cirrhosis s/p OLT
in [**2145**], with recurrent Hep C presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with one month
of DOE.   CT chest showed possible basilar interstitial fibrosis
with evidence of pulmonary HTN, and moderate pulmonary HTN
estimated on TTE.  As part of his evaluation, patient underwent
a bronchoscopy and VATS on [**2152-10-23**] with lung biopsy, pathology
revealing moderate-to-severe interstitial fibrosis with
honeycomb change and organizing pneumonia.  He has also finished
a 5-day course of levofloxacin for treatment of community
acquired pneumonia.

When on the floor, pt was found by nursing to have significant
work of breathing, with O2 saturation in the 60s.  Sats improved
after transitioning from 4 liters n/c to non-rebreather.  Chest
film showed possible volume overload, and patient was given
furosemide 40 mg IV x 1, with good UOP.  ABG was 7.41/35/61 on
nasal cannula and shovel mask, but had just been on
non-rebreather.

Upon assessment, vitals were significant for BP 170s/100s, and
HR in 100s, along with RR 30s and O2 sat 96% on non-rebreather.
He was transferred to the ICU.

On arrival to MICU, patient denied pain, but was still
significantly short of breath.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient's respiratory status deteriorated over the duration of
his stay. He was initially treated for community-acquired
pneumonia, but his lung biopsy was concerning for UIP with
superimposed BOOP vs. acute UIP exacerbation. Pt also with known
baseline pulmonary hypertension and volume overload.  He
required intubation on [**10-29**] for decreasing oxygenation on NRB
and respiratory distress.  He was initiated on vancomycin and
cefepime given clinical and radiographical deterioration. On
[**10-30**], patient desatted into the 50s on full vent support, FiO2
of 100% PEEP of 10, and had EKG findings consistent with acute
ischemic changes. Patient was started on nitric oxide at 20 PPM,
which was weaned off over the course of a day. This acute
decompensation was believed to be due to hypoxic pulmonary
vasoconstriction with subsequent R-to-L shunt through PFO,
complicated by acute right heart strain with ischemia. Pt's
respiratory status continued to be very tenuous, and he did not
show marked improvement with steroids.  Subsequent BAL also did
not show PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] family meeting was held on [**2152-11-2**], and the
family elected to change his goals of care to comfort-focused
care.  Non-palliative medications were discontinued and he was
started on a morphine gtt. At the family's request, he was
extubated.  At 7:41 PM on [**2152-11-2**], he passed away with family
at bedside.  Family declined autopsy.
