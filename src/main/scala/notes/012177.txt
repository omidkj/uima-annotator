Imaging:
CT C-Spine [**2-1**]:
IMPRESSION: No fracture. C3 on C4 anterolisthesis resulting in
mild central
canal narrowing. Mild cervical spondylosis with mild spinal
stenosis and
multilevel neural foraminal narrowing. MRI is a more sensitive
modality for
evaluation of spinal cord and ligamentous injury.

CTA Head [**2-1**]:
TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the head were obtained without
contrast. Following this, using departmental protocol, CT
angiography of the head was acquired. 3D and maximum intensity
reformatted images were obtained. Comparison was made with the
outside CT of the same date [**2137-2-1**] from [**Hospital **] Hospital.
FINDINGS HEAD CT:
There is a large area of hemorrhagic contusion seen in the
inferior right
frontal lobe which appears to have slightly increased in size
since the
previous study. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is also identified
bilaterally, right greater than left side in the convexity sulci
which is also more prominent since the previous study. A right
parietal subdural hematoma is
unchanged.There is blood identified with fluid level within the
right sphenoid sinus. No hydrocephalus or midline shift seen.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD:
The head CT angiography demonstrates no evidence of aneurysm. No
significant vascular spasm is identified.
The visualized distal internal carotid arteries demonstrate
somewhat irregular contour which could be secondary to
fibromuscular dysplasia.
Incidentally noted is a left frontal developmental venous
anomaly.
IMPRESSION:
1. Hemorrhagic contusion at the inferior right frontal lobe and
bilateral
subarachnoid hemorrhage. A small right parietal subdural
hematoma. The
hemorrhagic contusion in the inferior frontal lobe as well as
the subarachnoid hemorrhage have slightly increased in size
since the previous outside CT of [**2137-2-1**]. However, the right
parietal subdural hematoma is unchanged. Fluid level and blood
is seen within the right sphenoid sinus. No fracture noted.
2. CT angiography of the head demonstrates no evidence of
aneurysm or
vasospasm. Irregularity of the distal internal carotid arteries
indicate
fibromuscular dysplasia. No definite skull base fracture is seen
on bone
window images and no evidence of trauma to the internal carotid
artery is
identified.

CT Head [**2-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in appearance of multifocal right
frontal
hemorrhagic contusions with surrounding edema. Right hemispheric
subarachnoid hemorrhage and small right frontal and parietal
subdural hematomas are also unchanged.
2. Few unchanged foci of left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

CT Head [**2-3**]:
FINDINGS: There has been interval evolution of a multifocal
intra- and
extra-axial hemorrhage, including right inferior frontal
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with surrounding edema, consistent with contusions.
Subarachnoid right hemispheric hemorrhage and right frontal and
parietal subdural hemorrhage remains stable. There are no
definite new foci of intracranial hemorrhage. Intraventricular
hemorrhage seen on the prior CT is no longer visualized, likely
due to evolution of blood products. There is no shift of
normally midline structures. Hyperdense fluid in the sphenoid
sinus is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Interval evolution of multifocal right frontal
hemorrhagic
contusions, no change in degree of surrounding edema. Stable
appearance of
right hemispheric extra-axial hemorrhage. No new acute
intracranial
hemorrhage.

CTA Chest [**2-4**]:
CTA CHEST: A filling defect is identified in the segmental
branch to the
lateral segment of the right lower lobe, consistent with acute
pulmonary
embolus. Equivocal subsegmental filling defects are noted in the
left lower lobar branches. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions
are non-hemorrhagic. There is associated atelectasis. There is a
more focal consolidation vs bronchial impaction in the
suprahilar region in the right upper lobe (assessment somewhat
limited by motion). Coronary artery calcifications involve left
anterior descending coronary artery. Atherosclerotic aortic arch
calcifications are also present. The airways are patent to the
segmental levels bilaterally. Incidentally noted is a bovine
arch. This study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation. Imaged aspects of the liver and spleen are
unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no findings concerning for malignancy.
Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with pulmonary embolism to a segmental
branch to the lateral segment of the right lower lobe, and
equivocal left lower lobe
subsegmental pulmonary emboli.
2. Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions with adjacent
atelectasis.
3. Right upper lobe consolidation, likely infection.
4. Coronary artery calcifications.

Portable abdomen [**2-4**]:
ABDOMINAL/PELVIC RADIOGRAPH, FRONTAL VIEW: There is no
density/structure seen in the abdomen/pelvis corresponding to
the reported IVC filter. There is non-obstructive bowel gas.
There are multilevel degenerative changes, but no acute fracture
or dislocation. There is left-sided pleural effusion. There is
residual excreted IV contrast in the collecting system
bilaterally. The underlying soft tissues are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No IVC filter seen.
