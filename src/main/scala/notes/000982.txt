Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2131-8-30**] Cardiac cath
[**2131-8-31**]: Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x3:  Left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery; saphenous
vein grafts to diagonal and obtuse marginal arteries.
2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11845**] is a 73 M with a history of CVD s/p left carotid stent
placement on [**2131-8-8**], HTN, HL, DM2 who presents following an
episode of dizziness followed by N/V/D and associated chest
pain. He reports that he has been feeling well since his prior
hospitalization with no recurrence of neurologic symptoms
(initially had some right hand numbness/weakness which came and
went). He felt well when he went to bed last night. On awakening
this morning and turning over in bed, he felt extremely dizzy
and like the room was spinning around. He turned back and his
symptoms resolved after about 10 seconds. He then got out of bed
and walked toward his kitchen to take his medications, but felt
the sudedn onset of nausea and rushed to the bathroom where he
proceeded to vomit for ~ one hour. He also had several episodes
of "soft stool" during this period though stool was not liquidy.
No blood in emesis or stool. He was diaphoretic during this
time, and after about an hour of dry heaving began to develop
chest pain located just above the manubrium to a severity of
~6.5/10. He also had an exacerbation of chronic left biceps pain
radiating to his hand to [**10-22**] severity and throbbing in
quality. At this time, his wife called EMS. He was ultimately
able to take his morning medications and reports that though he
had some dry heaving afterward he did not vomit his pills. The
chest pain began to resolve on its own and was down to 1/10
prior to EMS arrival. En route to the ED, he received a second
325 mg of aspirin and sublingual NG spray, following which the
CP fully resolved. He did have persistence of the left arm pain,
though less severe.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 98.0, HR 130, BP 186/102 18 100% 4L
Nasal Cannula. His arm pain improved with one dose of 4 mg IV
morphine. Labwork was significant for WBC of 17.8 with
neutrophilic predominance on differential. CXR was notable for
possible early RLL pneumonia, for which he received 1 g IV vanco
and 750 mg levofloxacin for HAP given his recent
hospitalization. EKG was unremarkable. Vitals on transfer to the
floor were HR 122, BP 179/85, RR 18, O2 sat 97% on 2L. He was
admitted to medicine for treatment of pneumonia.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, he reported feeling significantly
improved. He has had no further vertigo, nausea, vomiting, or
diarrhea/loose stool since arriving in the ED. He does not feel
SOB and denies fever, chills, night sweats, shortness of breath,
cough, pleuritic chest pain or sputum production. No current CP
or arm pain.

Social History:
Married (second marriage) and lives with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] has one
stepson who lives nearby and two biological grown children who
live out of state. He was previously a heavy smoker (up to 4
packs per day) but quit 40 years ago. He drinks occasional beer
but keeps this to a minimum, because he continues to work as a
bus driver (cross-country charter buses) and takes jobs as they
come.

Family History:
Raised in an orphanage - does not know his biological family.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP): [**2131-8-29**]
1. Suboptimal study, as the left costophrenic angle is not fully
included and a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Slightly increased right lower lobe opacity, early consolidation
not excluded. Suggest dedicated PA and lateral views for better
evaluation when patient able.

TTE: [**2131-8-31**]: PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
There is mild basal and mid-inferoseptal wall hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results at time of surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced, on no inotropes. There is
moderate hypokinesis of the basal and mid-inferoseptal and
inferior wall of the left ventricle. Left ventricular systolic
function is unchanged. Right ventricular function is unchanged.
Mild aortic stenosis is unchanged. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is unchanged. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta
are intact.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**2131-8-30**]:
1) Coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated significant left main and functional three vessel
coronary artery disease. The LMCA had 70% stenosis with severe
damping. The LAD had 60% distal stenosis with a D1 with 70%
proximal stenosis.  The LCX had 70% stenosis at the origin. The
dominant RCA had 99% proximal stenosis, 99% mid stenosis, and
99% distal stenosis with left to right collaterals. 2) Limited
resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertension
(161/72/113). 3) Left ventriculography was deferred.
.
Non-contrast Chest CT [**2131-8-30**]:
1. Moderate calcifications of the ascending aorta, the aortic
arch, the
descending aorta and the supra-aortic branches.
Moderate-to-severe coronary
calcifications. 2. Multiple non-characteristic, partly calcified
and partly non-calcified pulmonary nodules. Several sub 5-mm
ground-glass nodules. 3. Part solid and part non-solid pulmonary
nodule in the anterior aspects of the right lower lobe, with
retractile behavior with regard to the major fissure. This
nodule needs to be followed by CT in approximately six months
from now. 4. Minimal bilateral basal scarring, left more than
right, with a minimal lef
