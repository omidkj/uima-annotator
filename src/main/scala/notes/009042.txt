Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ciprofloxacin / Sulfonamides

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
88 year old man with a history of asthma, aspiration, CRI, MIBI
perfusion defect in [**2191**], Afib, HTN, and recent admission for
pneumonia in [**2195-6-1**] who presents with cough productive of
bright yellow sputum, that was poorly responsive to albuterol at
home, over the two days prior to admission on [**10-27**].  He denied
any vomiting, or cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, but
endorsed nausea.  On the morning of [**10-27**], patient developed
increased dyspnea, but denied chest pain, or syncopal episodes.
Patient denied any jaw pain or shoulder pain.
.
At baseline, patient can walk one to two blocks and climb stairs
with assistance, per son.  During the several days prior to
admission, he lost his appetite and felt quite weak.  Of note,
patient relates that he returned from a 10-day cruise with his
son, who had had a cough during the trip.
.
Patient was brought to the ED by ambulance and had an SaO2 of
77% on room air, that increased to 94% on NRB.  He was alert and
oriented throughout time in the ED.  Chest Xray revealed a new
right lower lobe pneumonia, and he was started on ceftriaxone &
azithromycin, but later switched to cefepime, flagyl, and
azithromycin, as there was concern to cover aspirated flora.  In
the ED, he also received two courses of combivent nebulized
breathing treatments and improved markedly, with SaO2 increasing
to the mid 90s on 2L NC.
In the ED, he also received ASA, 10mg IV lopressor, and IVF (1.5
L of NS). Elevated troponins to 0.36 (.32-->.36-->.30) and EKG
demonstrated changes from before, with t-wave inversions in
V2-V6.  Cardiology consulted on [**10-28**], patient was loaded with
plavix, started on heparin gtt, aspirin, statin, and telemetry.
Transferred to the floor on [**10-28**].

Past Medical History:
Chronic renal insufficiency Cr [**3-6**]
Asthma

Kidney tumor bilaterally dx 30yrs ago, s/p partial resection

Social History:
Patient never smoked, drinks no alcohol and never used drugs.
Widowed. He is very functional, performing all ADL's.


Family History:
Has 2 living brothers and 5 deceased brothers and sisters.   [**Name (NI) **]
has 5 children and 3 grandchildren, one of his sons has CAD s/p
bypass.

Physical Exam:
Vitals upon admission to MICU ([**2195-10-27**]):
Tm:98.9, Tc:96.3, P:67 (64-120), BP:103/35 (120-130s)/(40-90s),
RR:23, O2sat: 93% on 35% humidified air
.
On transfer to Medical Service ([**2195-10-28**]):
VS: Tc 95.8, HR: 70, BP: 114/60, RR:20, 94% on 4L O2
Gen: Patient resting comfortably in bed.  Pleasant.  NAD.  Alert
and oriented to person, place, date.
HEENT: Slightly dry mucous membranes.  No scleral icterus.
Lungs:  Crackles in lower lung fields, with right greater than
left.  Upper lung fields demonstrate mild rhonchi, bilaterally.
CV: Irregularly irregular pulse.  Normal S1 and S2.  Did not
auscultate any murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abd: Active bowel sounds throughout.  No tenderness to
palpation.  Soft and slightly distended.
Rectal: guiac negative brown stool in ICU.
Ext: WWP.  2+ bilateral DP and radial pulses, bilaterally.  No

Pertinent Results:
EKG ([**10-28**]): AF @60, nl axis, Q waves in V1-2, 1mm STE in V2-3,
1mm STD in V4-5 with TWI, low voltage
.
ECHO ([**10-29**]): The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
septal hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
  Compared with the report of the prior study (images
unavailable for review) of [**2195-6-9**], septal hypokinesis is new.
.
CXRAY([**11-2**]):  Right upper lobe pneumonia has largely cleared.
There is new collapse of the left lower lobe, accounting for
leftward mediastinal shift. Generalized hyperinflation suggests
COPD. Heart size top normal, unchanged.
.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallowing ([**10-28**]):  An oropharyngeal
swallowing video fluoroscopy study was performed in
collaboration with the speech and swallow department. Varying
consistencies of barium were administered under constant
fluoroscopic guidance. Patient demonstrated mild-to-moderate
penetration with nectar thick and thin liquids. Silent, mild
aspiration of thin liquids was seen secondary to spillover of
penetration and/or residue in the valleculae and piriform
sinuses.
.
Urine Culture ([**10-27**]): PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA.    10,000-100,000
ORGANISMS/ML.
.
Sputum Culture ([**10-28**]): OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA ABSENT. STAPH AUREUS
COAG +.    SPARSE GROWTH.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
88 year old man with previous coronary artery disease, CRI,
asthma, aspiration, AF, HTN, and previous admissions for
pneumonia who presents with acute onset of dyspnea and
productive cough over the past two days.  Radiographic evidence
of new right lower lobe pneumonia and laboratory evidence
(troponins) and EKG changes of acute coronary syndrome.
.
1) Hypoxia:
  Patient presented on [**2195-10-27**] in acute respiratory distress,
with oxygen saturations to 77% on room air.  Chest xray revealed
new evidence of pneumonia in right lower lobe.  Began ten-day
course of azithromycin and flagyl, as sputum culture ([**10-28**])
speciation revealed staph aureus.  Azithromycin course will be
completed on [**11-5**].  Discontinued flagyl on [**11-2**], as no evdience
of anaerobes.
  Repeat chest Xray on [**11-2**] revealed resolving right sided
pneumonia, but slight new collapse in left lower lobe.  Will
encourage patient to continue respiratory exercises.  Patient's
oxygen saturations on room air in the mid-90's.  On physical
examination, slight crackles in lower right lung fields remain,
but marked improvement from admission.  Cough productive of
yellow/white sputum, but developed slight hemoptysis for one
day.  Believed result of previous heparin administration.  By
discharge, no evidence of hemoptysis for several days.
  During hospitalization, continued nebulizers for asthma.
.
2) Potential ACS:
  Despite denying chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, on
admission evidence of lateral ischemia (T-wave inversions in
lateral leads, V1-V4, in patient with LAD disease, documented in
[**2191**]), consistent with NSTEMI.  New septal hypokinesis detected
on cardiac echo on [**10-29**].  Discussed possible cardiac
catheterization on [**10-30**], but patient and team decided that renal
insufficiency and underlying comorbid
