Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICU monitoring

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fib
presented to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain. The
patient was recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 1516**] service on [**2150-3-25**]
after an attempt at chemical cardioversion with amiodarone
infusion and question DC cardioversion. During that
hospitalization, her rate was controlled and she was sent home
with PO amiodarone 200mg daily. Her VNA called in the day
following discharge that her rate was still elevated to 120s.
She was instructed to take amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week in
an attempt to rate control. She was scheduled to follow up as an
outpatient, however she was experiencing chest pain at home and
presented to the ED. This morning she had chest pain while in
bed, it was band like on her left chest.
.
In the ED, the patient's HR was in the 150s with a SBP at 156 on
arrival. An ECG showed afib with LBBB. She had CEs sent which
were negative. The patient received ASA, Dilt 10mg IV x 2 and
attempted dilt drip temporarily, Amiodarone 400mg PO X1.
Lopressor 5mg IV x 3 given with no response. SBP down to 80s
following, although she was asymptomatic, she received 900ccs of
IVF. On transfer to the CCU, she continued to have mild chest
tightness and shortness of breath. She had a CXR which showed
evidence of volume overload.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus seen. Diffuse, but
non-mobile aortic atheromata.
.
CXR [**2150-3-29**]: In comparison to the prior study, there has been
progression of the interstitial and alveolar edema with slight
enlargement of the left
pleural effusion. Repeat radiography following appropriate
diuresis
recommended to assess for underlying infection
.
CXR [**2150-3-29**]:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
the pulmonary vessels appear somewhat less engorged. Continued
left pleural effusion. Prominence of the right hilum persists,
much of which may merely be vascular. Mild atelectatic changes
are again seen at the left base.
.
CXR [**2150-3-31**]:  As compared to the previous radiograph, moderate
bilateral pleural effusions have newly occurred. There is
associated retrocardiac atelectasis.  The size of the cardiac
silhouette is mildly increased; there is an increase in vascular
diameters. In addition, mild peribronchial cuffing is seen.
Overall, these findings are suggestive of moderate pulmonary
edema.
Otherwise, no relevant changes, there is no evidence of newly
appeared
parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of paroxysmal atrial fib admitted to
the CCU for recurrent a fib with RVR.
.
# A fib: The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient for this condition. She had taken amiodarone for
years in the past, however discontinued and restarted recently
following DC cardioversion. No clear cause of increased
occurences of a fib with RVR, TSH on last admission wnl, UA and
CXR today showed no signs of infection however pt has
leukocytosis.  Patient was placed on amiodarone drip after bolus
for rate control.  Esmolol drip was attempted, however patient's
blood pressure did not tolerate.  She was started on a heparin
drip and then underwent TEE (which showed no clot) and DCCV
after which she converted to NSR with a rate in the 60s on the
amiodar
