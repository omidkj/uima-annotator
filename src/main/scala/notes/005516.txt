History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname 10132**] is a 58 year old female with a history of metastatic
renal caricnoma to the brain, spine and lungs s/p multiple
thoracic procedures for resesection of pulmonary metastases who
was admitted to the neurosurgical service on [**2188-7-14**] for planned
vertebrectomy and reconstruction of T8 and T9.  She underwent
this procedure on [**2188-7-16**].

The procedure was uncomplicated and she has been healing well
from a surgical perspective.  She was extubated on the 9th.  She
notes that she has had a cough since extubation but has not been
bringing up significant secretions.  She notes that she feels as
if she has a weak cough.  She spiked a fever to 102 degrees on
[**2188-7-18**] and was noted to have wheezing.  She had a portable CXR
which was suggestive of pneumonia and was started on
levofloxacin. She spiked again on [**2188-7-19**] and had cultures
drawn.  She had a CT T-spine to evaluate post-operatively and
although not protocoled to evaluate the lungs, lung windows
revealed a moderate-to-large left pleural effusions, small right
pleural effusion with bibasilar dependent consolidations, left
greater than right, concerning for pneumonia and pleural
effusions. Her pulse was in the high 90s on [**2188-7-17**] and has risen
gradually to the 120s.  A trigger was called on the floor at
16:29 on [**2188-7-19**] when she developed worsening respiratory
status.  She was noted to appear anxious with labored breathing
with respiratory rates in the 30s and HR in the 130s.  She
reports that her acute respiratory distress started shortly
after receiving acetylcysteine She received 1 mg PO ativan and a
MICU evaluation was called.  ABG was 7.46/41/64.  She received a
nebulizer treatment which she says improved her symptoms and was
also placed on 50% by facemask.  She was started on vancomycin
and cefepime.  She was transferred to the MICU for further
management.

On arrival the MICU she reports that her respiratory symptoms
have dramatically improved.  She is no longer coughing.  She has
mild pain with deep inspiration but is able to take a deep
breath.  She has cough productive of minimal sputum and feels as
if her cough is weak.  She feels chills but is not currently
febrile.  Her appetite is poor.  She has no nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or
swelling.  She has not had a bowel movement for 3 days.
