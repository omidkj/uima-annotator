Pertinent Results:
U/S- no dvt

CT ab/pelvis- [**2135-1-1**]
1. Small bowel obstrcution, with transition point at the base of
a bowel- containing anterior abdominal hernia. This finding was
discussed with the surgical team, including doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 1299**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **], at the time of image acquisition and interpretation.
2. Distention of the ascending, transverse, and a portion of the
descending colon. This finding is of uncertain etiology and
could possibly relate to mass effect upon the descending colon
by an adjacent distended loop of small bowel, or, alternatively,
could represent focal colonic ileus due to inflammation within
the adjacent obstructed small bowel. Although this is a
noncontrast examination and limited in the evaluation of the
mucosa, there is no definite evidence of bowel wall thickening.
The possibility of bowel ischemia cannot be entirely excluded,
although there are no definite signs of ischemia such as gas
within the portal mesenteric circulation. These findings were
also discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
3. Distention of the gallbladder, without evidence of
pericholecystic stranding and with normal caliber of the common
bile duct.
4. Ascites.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 79 yo female with mult med problems who presents with
bilat LE swelling and erythema. Ddx: cellulitis vs. chronic
venous stasis vs. ischemic disease

LE Cellulitis- seemed chronic, however the pain in right leg was
new.  Cellulitis on right more likely since pain was present at
all times and RLE was warm.  She was treated with IV abx and
there was great improvment with elevation and ace wrap.

Cutaneous fungal infection- multiple areas of fungal type
infection in intriginous regions especially right flank skin
folds.
-nystatin powder and a wound care nurse visited the patient
every day.

CHF- ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 30-35% on echo in [**1-7**], legs
seem very edematous, neck veins hard to evaluate.  She was
treated with lasix, aldactone, ace, bb

Diabetes mellitus
-cont'd glypizide
-RISS
-diabetic diet

Hypertension
-cont'd ace, [**Last Name (un) **], bb

Coronary artery disease-
-cont'd outpt ASA
-EKG showed no new changes

Hyperlipidemia
-continued outpt lipitor

Depression
-she was cont on outpt zoloft

Diarrhea- patient developed diarrhea on [**2134-12-29**] and wbc count
was increased on to 19.5 on [**2134-12-30**], c. diff and stool cultures
were sent and came back neg.
Patient's condition started to deteriorate on [**2135-1-1**], becoming
more somnelant and a markedly tender abdomen and her abdominal
hernia was not longer reducible.  She was promptly evaluated by
the surgery team to reduced her hernia and an ng tube was placed
to send her for CT scan.  At that time, patient's daughter
insisted that the patient be full code although she was noted to
be dnr/dni.  Patient confirmed in the presence of an interpreter
that she did NOT want to be resuscitated or intubated.  Finally
CT scan showed incarcerated hernia and patient was transferred
to the MICU.  In the MICU she was treated supportively, however,
her condition deteriorated and she passed away on [**2135-1-2**].
