History of Present Illness:
HPI: 68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD (fev1 62%
pred, fvc 56% 11/06) p/w BRBPR. Yesterday PM pt had episode of
large vol (not quantified) BRBPR, though no stool, associated
with abd cramps. Pt has never had this in the past. Pt has had
[**12-29**] similar episodes q 1 hour since that time. Denies n/v. Has
also complained of mild cough and "spitting up" small amounts of
blood-tinged sputum. Otherwise without complaints. Pt to ED
today by cab.
.
In ED 97, hr 90, bp, 108/53, rr 18, sat 97% RA. Pt remained
hemodynamically throughout. NGL attempted X 6 but attempts were
unsuccessful and pt developed brisk nose bleed. 2 18 guage IVs
placed. Hct in ED 25, INR 2.4. Vit K 10 mg po X1 given. Per
report, no blood products immediately available by cross-match.
GI consulted in ED, plan for EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] in MICU. Pt transferred to
MICU for further management.
.
ROS: As above, also pt denies cp/sob/HA/vision/blance
changes/joint or muscle pain or swelling/hematuria.

PROGRESS NOTE ON TRANSFER FROM MICU TO [**Hospital1 **]:
68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD (fev1 62% pred,
fvc 56% 11/06) who presented with BRBPR on [**3-22**]. He reported
having a large volume of BRBPR without stool and associated with
abdominal cramps. In the ED, he was hemodynamically stable, NGL
attempted but not performed as pt developed nose bleed. Hct 25,
INR 2.4, was given 10 mg vitamin K and admitted to the MICU. An
EGD was unremarkable and and a colonscopy was significant for
blood in the colon, sigomid diverticulosis, but no clear source
of the bleeding. A SMA angiogram was significant for
extravasation of contrast at the distal ileocolic branches,
which was successfully embolized. He received a total of 10 U
pRBC and 10 U FFP while in the MICU. Given his h/o
thrombocythemia with clots and the fact that his
anti-coagulation was held in the setting of GI bleed, LENIs were
performed that showed a chronic appearing L superficial vein
DVT. An IVC filter was placed. The pt then began to c/o nausea
and increasing abdominal pain and LFTs were significant for an
obstructive picture. A RUQ US showed a thick, edematous GB wall
that was concerning for possible cholecystitis and surgery was
consulted. A HIDA scan did not exclude the possibility of
cholecystitis. He was started on cipro, flagyl, and unasyn and
then underwent an ERCP in which a stone was removed from the
biliary tree, a sphincterotomy was performed, and the CBD was
noted to be dilated to 12 mm.

Past Medical History:
1. DVT RLE ([**2105**]) hospitalized

2. Aortic Regurg ([**7-/2101**]) ECHO TTE: The left atrium is normal in
size. There is moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricle cavity is normal in size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-65%). Normal
right ventricular chamber size and systolic function. The aortic
root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened/sclerotic, but move well. Mild aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no pericardial effusion.

3. Influenza A--> "coma" for 21 days ([**2100**]) Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 **]
for respiratory distress. Dignosed w/ influenza or PNA. pt was
intubated. cultured MRSA. RUQ ultrasound showed a hypoechoic
pancreas and sludge in the gallbladder. He was subsequently
extubated and did better. He received antibiotics. Incidentally
was diagnosed with Anemia and manocytosis so got Bone Marrow
Biopsy.

4. Anemia/ Manocytosis (myelodysplastic syndrome):
[**2-/2100**] Bone Marrow Biopsy: Cellularity is 60% overall which is
hypercellular for the patient's age. Myeloid: erythroid ratio
estimate is normal. Megakaryocytes are adequate in number and
normal in distribution. No abnormal localization of immature
precursors is found. No carcinoma, lymphoma, or granulomas are
seen. Note: The high MCV, hypercellular marrow and subtle
[**Hospital1 **]-lineage anomalies can be seen in an evolving myelodysplastic
syndrome. Follow-up is suggested.

[**2-16**] Path report: peripheral blood for immunophenotyping flow
cytometry phenotyping: impression: clonal lymphocytosis.
Recommend T cell receptor gene rearrangement study by polymerase
chain reaction to rule-out a T/NK cell lymphoproliferative
disorder.

4. hemochromocytosis or sideroblastic anemia? [**2100**]: The patient
was noted on admission to have a hematocrit of 41 with an MCV of
119. His folate, B12 and TSH levels all were normal. His iron
studies revealed an iron of 113, total iron binding capacity of
135, ferritin of greater than 1000 and a TRF of 104. His iron to
total iron binding capacity ratio was 83%.

5. Pancreatitis: [**2100-1-15**] during ICU admission.

6. HTN: well controlled with Tiazadone

7. Gout: controlled with Allopurinal 300 daily

8. COPD "breathing much improved since stopped smoking 9 months
ago".

9. Scarlet fever as child.

Social History:
1-2 packs per day for > 50 years (began whe he was 9 and just
stopped 9 months ago). Pt has positive alcohol history: claims
to have stopped or greatly reduced drinking, but did report in
[**2100**] drinking [**2-18**] six- packs per day on the weekends, 2-3 beers
a day during the week.


Family History:
Mother died in 80s not sure what from. His father has
hypertension- died in his 60s from heart attack?. 2 siblings are
alive and in good health. Son has asthma.

IMAGING:
CXR [**3-22**] - The cardiac silhouette is enlarged, but stable in
size.  The aorta is tortuous.  Pulmonary vascularity is within
normal limits.  Hazy opacities in the lower lung regions may be
due to crowding of vasculature related to low lung volumes, but
it is difficult to exclude peribronchiolar infection or
aspiration.  PA and lateral chest radiograph with improved
inspiratory volumes may be helpful for more complete assessment
of these regions.
.
EGD [**3-22**]: Normal EGD to duodenum.
.
Colonscopy [**3-23**]: Blood in the whole colon. Diverticulosis of the
sigmoid colon
.
SMA Angiogram [**3-23**]: SMA angiogram demonstrates extravasation of
contrast from the distal ileocolic branches. Successful coil
embolization of distal feeding branches of the ileocolic artery.

.
LENI [**3-26**]: Long segment left superficial femoral vein DVT.  Wall
thickening of the left common femoral vein suggestive of sequela
of prior DVT.  Combined with the patient's history, these
findings likely represent a chronic DVT.
.
[**3-27**]: Successful placement of Bard recoverable G2 filter in the
infrarenal inferior vena cava.
.
RUQ US [**3-27**] - 1.  Echogenic liver and splenomega
