History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old female recently admitted with chest
pressure and hypertensive urgency, found to have 5.9 cm TAAA
(has been present since at least [**2150**] but now larger), who
presents with the same symptoms. She had a CTA done on [**2155-8-28**]
showing an aortic aneurysm all the way from the aortic arch to
the iliac bifurcation.

Her chest pressure started this morning when she bent forward
and has continued unabated for hours. She describes the location
as substernal with radiation to her back and intense in nature.
The pressure is worse than on last admission and the back
radiation is new. She has no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, or shortness of breath. Her SBP is 170 in the right
arm as on initial examination of the patient; she was also
hypertensive when picked up by EMS. In the interim, her pressure
has intermittently dropped after nitroglycerin administration.
She has known left subclavian stenosis and SBP in the left arm
is typically around 100 consequently.

She has a PMH of STEMI s/p stenting of RCA in 2/[**2153**]. During the
last admission, cardiac enzymes were cycled and were normal
throughout.

Past Medical History:
-NSTEMI [**2153-8-25**] - medically managed
-Left subclavian steal -> therefore has discrepancy in BP in R
versus L arm. BP should be measured in R arm.
-Hypertension
-Tobacco habit, half pack per day times 40 years.
-Hyperlipidemia, primarily LDL elevation.
-Right carotid bruit.
-Peripheral [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease status post stenting to right iliac
artery.
-Thyroid cancer, papillary carcinoma, removed with total
thyroidectomy in [**2148-9-23**]. Of note, had two
hyperfunctioning nodules and one cold nodule. on synthroid
-Left rotator cuff tendonitis.
-Status post left hand crush injury in distant past


Social History:
-Tobacco history: Currently smokes [**11-24**] ppd for 54 years
-Alcohol: None
-Illicit drugs: None
Patient lives alone in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], functional with ADLs and IADLs.

Drives, with no help needed for ambulation.


Family History:
CVA in brother at 55 years of age, CHF in mother at [**Age over 90 **] years of
age.  No history of collagen/fibrillin disorders, no history of
aneurysms.

Pertinent Results:
[**2155-8-30**]: CXR: No acute intrathoracic process with unchanged
6.2-cm thoracic aortic aneurysm. Subsequent CTA demonstrates
intramural aortic hematoma which is not visible by plain
radiography.

[**2155-8-30**]: CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis with/without contrast:
1.Type B intramural hematoma of the thoracic aorta extending
from the aorta just distal to the left subclavian origin to the
mid descending thoracic aorta. No significant interval change in
the size of the fusiform descending thoracic aortic aneurysm,
maximally measuring 5.5 cm with internal intramural thrombus
within the aneurysm.
2. Stable appearance of the fusiform infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm
maximally measuring 3.5 cm.
3. Stable chronic occlusion of the left subclavian artery origin
with distal reconstitution.

[**2155-9-1**]: MR Lumbar spine WOC:
Elevated signal, linear in pattern within the mid-thoracic
spinal cord, at approximately the T6-7 level. Cord is not
swollen, however recent aortic surgery raises the suspicion for
developing infarction.
There does not appear to be any spinal cord compression. Within
the lumbar region, there is generalized moderate desiccation of
the discs, with mild bulging disc noted at L4-5. Moderate left
and milder right foraminal stenosis.

[**2155-9-3**]: Lower extremity non-inasive studies: no DVT
bilaterally.

[**2155-9-6**]: CT Head WOC: IM No evidence for acute intracranial
hemorrhage, large mass, mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus.
Prominent extra-axial CSF spaces, sulci, and ventricles suggest
age-related involutional changes. White matter hypodensities are
likely secondary to small vessel ischemic disease.

[**2155-9-6**]: MRA Head/Neck with/without contrast:  limited by
motion. Diminished flow signal in the left ICA is seen in the
cavernous region and in the petrous region, but the flow signal
in the MCA is poorly visualized due to motion. Flow signal is
seen in the sylvian branches of both middle cerebral arteries.
The right CCA, visualized right subclavian artery, and the right
ICA demonstrate no evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion.
Right vertebral artery is tortuous but demonstrates normal flow
without stenosis.

[**2155-9-6**]: CTA Head/Neck: 1. Head CT shows no hemorrhage. 2.CT
angiography of the neck demonstrates slight narrowing of the
origin of the left CCA but no evidence of diminished flow seen
distal to the origin. Approximately 50% stenosis in the left
internal carotid bifurcation region is identified with
calcification. 3. The left subclavian artery is occluded near
the origin and is reconstituted through collateral flow from the
left vertebral artery

[**2155-9-15**]: CT Chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast: Satisfactory
appearance of the thoracic aortic stent graft. Small left
pleural effusion noted with compressive atelectasis in the left
lower lobe. Post-surgical changes seen in the left inguinal
region with a seroma overlying the right common femoral artery
access point.

[**2155-9-24**]: Bilateral Lower Extremity non-invasives: No evidence of
deep venous thrombosis in either extremity.

[**2155-9-26**]: PEG tube study: Appropriate positioning of PEG with
placement confirmed by contrast. No evidence of contrast
extravasation.

[**2155-9-26**]: CT Torso with contrast: stable appearance of thoracic
aortic stent graft. Small pleural effusions, left greater than
right. Stable cardiomegaly with pericardial effusion. Status
post gastrostomy placement with expected trace free air. Severe
atheros
