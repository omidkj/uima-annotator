Pertinent Results:
[**2157-5-19**] Cath: 1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant
system demonstrated three-vessel disease. The LMCA had distal
eccentric 70-80% stenosis. The LAD had mild diffuse disease. The
LCx had 60-70% origin stenosis. The RCA had proximal 80-90% and
mid 60% in-stent stenosis. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics
revealed systemic arterial normotension. The rhythm was paced
with frequent VPCs.

[**2157-5-20**] Carotid U/S: Bilateral 40-59% carotid stenosis

[**2157-5-24**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-39 %). There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic
aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There are
filamentous strands on the ventricular side of the aortic
leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The leaflets appear mildly tethered. Mild to
moderate ([**1-23**]+) central mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: LV systolic function remains impaired, estimated
EF=35-40% with patient on Epi, Norepi, and phenylephrine
infusions. RV systolic function appears mildly improved from
pre-bypass. Valvular function remains unchanged. There is no
evidence of aortic dissection. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results at time of study.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a 66 year old mane
complaining of worsening chest pain. Upon transfer, he underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed left main and three
vessel coronary artery disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted
and he underwent usual pre-operative work-up.  He underwent
preoperative workup, which also included carotid ultrasound and
pulmonary function test. Echocardiogram showed a good EF with
normal valvular function. Electrophysiology was consulted for
ICD management peri-operatively. The patient was brought to the
operating room on [**2157-5-24**] and underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft x 4 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative report for
further details. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours
he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.

He was transferred to the floor for the remainder of his stay.
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.  On
[**5-28**] he developed a distended abdomen with question of ileus on
abdmominal film.  He had nasogastric tube placed and was started
on intravenous hydration.  Surgery was consulted for evaluation
due to worsening abdominal film and continued distention.  After
gastric decompression and multiple enemas he improved.  His
nasogastric tube was removed [**5-31**] and he was restarted on liquid
diet with serial abdominal exams.  At the time of discharge his
ileus was resolved, he was tolerating a reg diet and passing
stool. He was discharged to home on POD#10. All instructions and
appointments were advised.
