Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
69yo Man with hx of DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia and CAD s/p ant/lat
MI in '[**60**] transferred from [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30746**] for mgt of CHF and
PNA. Pt reports 2 weeks of URI sx consisting of cough productive
of green sputum.  On the day prior to his presentation to his
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and complaints of
dizziness.  Seen by PCP and sent to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  In the ED, a CXR
was read as volume overload vs infiltrate.  He was then diuresed
with lasix which led to hypotension requiring BP support with
Dopa.  Started on CTX/Azithro. Blood cx taken at OSH grew out
gram pos diplococci and vancomycin was added.  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on Dopamine for further management.
.
Pt was admitted to the CCU for management of the pt's
hypotension, ?sepsis and ? CHF exacerbation.  In the CCU, pt was
weaned off the dopamine and given his lack of volume overload on
exam, there was no further diuresis.  His BP rose to 100s/60s
off pressors and maintained with gentle fluid boluses.  When
blood cx returned strep pneumo sensitive to ceftriaxone, azithro
and vancomycin were discontinued.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2164-6-27**] 1:43 PM
Likely chronic scarring at the left lung base. However, there is
a new opacity in the right cardiophrenic angle as well as in the
left lower lobe suggestive of pneumonia. Clinical correlation is
advised. A repeat film when the patient's symptoms resolve is
recommended. There is no radiographic evidence of CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
69M with history of DM2, CAD (s/p anterior STEMI [**2160**], EF35%),
here with strep pneumo bacteremia (outside hospital cultures)
and bibasilar pneumonia who developed hypotension after getting
diuresed for presumed CHF.
.
1. Pneumonia:  Pt was initially treated with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia and Vancomycin was
added when his blood cx grew out GPC in pairs.  Once the cx
results returned as strep pneumo, azithro and vanc were stopped.
 On day of discharge, he was changed to po levaquin which the
strep pneumo was also sensitive to (per OSH micro lab).  Blood
cx at [**Hospital1 18**] were no growth at discharge.  Pt will continue
Levaquin for total of 14 days.
.
2. CHF: Pt was EF of 35% on [**2163**] echo.  Due to a presumed CHF
exacerbation at OSH, he was diuresed and then became
hypotensive.  Pt was likely volume depleted due to vomiting and
diarrhea and then became hypotensive after receiving lasix. No
evidence of volume overload on exam or on CXR.  Pt was weaned
off dopamine and received gentle fluid boluses to maintain
MAP>50.  Once his BP was back to baseline, his lasix, coreg and
lisinopril were restarted.
.
3. CAD: Pt with MI in [**2160**] s/p stent but no active ischemia.
Continued ASA, statin, BB, ACE-I
.
4. DM: Continued Metformin, Avandia, RISS.
