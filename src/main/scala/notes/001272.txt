Service:

NOTE:  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 139**] service from the
Medical Intensive Care Unit following her admission on [**2137-3-10**].  Therefore, I will provide a brief summary of her
History of Present Illness and Medical Intensive Care Unit
course.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented to [**Hospital1 1444**] on the day of admission with
epigastric pain with radiation to her back which lasted
approximately two hours and then resolved spontaneously.  In
addition, the patient had dark stools one day prior to
admission and moderate shortness of breath.

The patient was found to be hypotensive in the Emergency
Department with a blood pressure of 93/44 which responded to
IVFs.   She was also given 1 unit
of packed red blood cells as her hematocrit was found to be
16.2 (down from 28.1) on last check on [**2137-2-26**].
23, [**2136**].

Gastroenterology was consulted in the Emergency Department
but did not wish to scope the patient immediately on
admission as she had a negative nasogastric lavage and
grossly guaiac-positive stool.  After receiving the normal
saline and packed red blood cells, the patient became
increasingly short of breath.  She required intubation for
respiratory distress after reversal of her do not
resuscitate/do not intubate order.

An electrocardiogram on admission was significant for 2-mm ST
depressions in V4 through V6 with no ST elevations.  The
patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

The patient then received 4 units of packed red blood cells
over the evening.  On the morning of [**2137-3-14**] she
self-extubated.  By that time, her hematocrit had increased
dramatically to 32.1.  She was continued NPO on twice per day
proton pump inhibitor over the next two days.

On [**3-15**], the patient was significantly more stable and
underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed
esophagitis without bleeding, nonbleeding angiectasias in the
antrum and stomach body, lack of blood in the stomach, and
nonbleeding angiectasias in the proximal duodenal bulb, with
no blood in the duodenum.  The GI team felt that more
angiectasias were most probably in the small intestinal tract
and were the most likely cause of the patient's bleeding.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's respiratory
status was stable following self-extubation on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  She had initially been started on Zosyn on
admission as she was extremely ........ and had persistent
bilateral consolidations on her chest x-ray.  However, it was
discontinued on [**2137-3-15**] as it was felt the pneumonia
was simply remnant on the radiographic imaging.

The patient's creatinine began increasing following
admission, and on transfer to the [**Hospital1 139**] team on [**2137-3-15**] was 1.7 (up from a baseline of 0.7).  This was felt to
be secondary to dehydration secondary to her Lasix and NPO
status.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**3-14**] to evaluate the
patient's cardiac status which showed the left and right
atrium to be normal size, dilated left ventricular cavity
with global hypokinesis with a LV ejection fraction of 10% to
20%, 1 to 2+ atrial regurgitation, 2+ mitral regurgitation,
2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and no pericardial effusions.

On [**2137-3-15**] before being transferred to the [**Hospital1 139**] team,
the patient was started on hydralazine and isosorbide
dinitrate for afterload reduction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Congestive heart failure (with a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 10% to 20%).
 2.  Hypertension.
 3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 4.  Anemia; the patient had diverticulosis on past
colonoscopy and a gastrointestinal bleed per the History of
Present Illness.
 5.  Recurrent pneumonia.
 6.  Diverticulosis.
 7.  Status post shingles.
 8.  Trigeminal neuralgias.
 9.  Status post periorbital cellulitis.
10.  Status post cholecystectomy.
11.  Status post appendectomy.
12.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm; which on last imaging was 4.5
cm in diameter and present along 8 cm of the aortic length.
A Surgery consultation was obtained on admission, but the
patient and her family declined to proceed with surgery.
13.  Left tibial rod status post trauma.

ALLERGIES:  OxyContin (which causes nausea and vomiting).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Serevent twice per day.
4.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Combivent 1 to 2 puffs q.4h. as needed.
7.  Neurontin 100 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
8.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
9.  Desipramine 50 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is the mother of nine children.
She currently lives with her daughter.  She [**Hospital1 18038**] one pack
per day for 60 years but quit 3 years ago.  Occasional
alcohol in the past but none currently.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION TO MEDICAL INTENSIVE
CARE UNIT:  Vitals revealed her temperature was 97.7, her
blood pressure was 133/48, her heart rate was 104, her
respiratory rate was 23, and oxygen saturation was 100% on 4
liters nasal cannula.  In general, a pale/cachectic lady.
Mildly tachypneic but appeared to be comfortable.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination the pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was
pale.  The mucous membranes were moist.  Edentulous.  Neck
with positive jugular venous pulsation to the angle of the
jaw.  Lungs revealed bilateral rales (right greater than
left) two thirds of the way up the lungs.  Right base
bronchial sounds.  No wheezing.  Decreased breath sounds
throughout.  Cardiac examination revealed tachycardic.  A
regular rhythm.  First heart sounds and second heart sounds.
No murmurs.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Positive hepatojugular
reflux.  Extremities revealed 1+ lower extremity edema to the
knees.  Positive presacral edema.  Neurologically, alert and
oriented times three.  Moved all extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count 15.1, her hematocrit was 16.2, and her platelets
were 420.  INR was 1.3.  Chemistries revealed sodium was 135,
potassium was 4.4, chloride was 95, bicarbonate was 33, blood
urea nitrogen was 32, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose
was 147.  Albumin was 2.6, her amylase was 46, and her lipase
was 21.  Creatine kinase was 31.  Troponin was 0.15.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Abdominal computed tomography
revealed stable abdominal aortic aneurysm without evidence of
rupture.  Persistent consolidations including effusions in
the lung bases (right greater than left).  No evidence of
congestive heart failure.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   Please above History of Present
Illness for summary of the Medical Intensive Care Unit
course.

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient's hematocrit
remained fairly stable after she was moved to the floor until
the time of discharge.  Throughout this time, she appeared to
be fairly hemoconcentrated.  She required no further
transfusions.  The patient did have one stool during this
time which was melanotic in nature and guaiac-positive.  The
patient was continued on pantoprazole 40 mg intravenously
twice per day initially and then switched by mouth proton
pump inhibitor twice per day.  It was recommended by
Gastroenterology that she follow up with an outpatient
colonoscopy in two to three months.  However, this will not
be happening as the patient was discharged to home on
hospice.

2.  DECOMPENSATED CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  On [**2137-3-17**] the patient had two episodes of presumed flash
pulmonary edema.  These responded to Lasix, morphine, and
sublingual nitroglycerin.  A chest x-ray at that time showed
the volume overload, and the patient's lungs were consistent
with congestive heart failure.

The decision was made to move her to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Three and begin on
a nesiritide drip.  The patient was continued on the
nesiritide drip which was titrated to a maximum dose of 0
