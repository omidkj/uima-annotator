History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28983**] is a 61 yo male with PMH significant for CLL, BPH,
and erlichiosis who presents with worsening SOB over past 4
days. Per patient he has been feeling SOB since [**Month (only) 404**] but his
symptoms were subtle at the time. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] in
[**3-12**] and was started on Lisinopril and Lasix for an EF~45%. The
patient also recently transferred his oncology care to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from [**Company 2860**]. He also admits to having some fevers and night
sweats few weeks ago which have resolved. Over the past few days
he is SOB when he speaks and after walking short distances. He
also admits to PND and orthopnea. He otherwise denies chest
pain, abdominal pain, N/V or significant weight loss. Last
erlichiosis test was negative.

Past Medical History:
1)Chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Diagnosed in [**4-10**] by flow
cytometry. Transferred care from [**Company 2860**] to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
2)Erlichiosis: diagnosed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1057**] in [**7-11**]; p/w
persisting fevers and required 7 weeks of doxycycline before he
defervesced.
3)History of basal cell carcinoma of skin.
4)Osteoarthritis of hands.
5)Urinary frequency with BPH.
6)Hyperplastic colonic polyp resected in [**2-4**] colonoscopy.
7)Ankle fracture in early [**2128**] complicated by DVT requiring
coumadin anticoagulation.

Social History:
Patient is retired lawyer. Lives with wife and has home on [**Name (NI) **].
Denies tobacco or IVDA. Occasional alcohol use.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
vitals T 97.6 Tmax 102.6 BP 102/78 AR 90 RR 22 O2 sat 98% on 3L
Gen: Pleasant male, lying in bed
HEENT: MMM
Neck: No cervical lymphadenopathy appreciated, ? JVD
Heart: nl s1/s2, no s3/s4, no m,r,g
Lungs: CTAB with scattered crackles; decreased BS @ L posterior
base
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, +BS
Extremities: no edema, 2+ DP/PT pulses bilaterally

Pertinent Results:
1)Cxray ([**2146-4-27**]): Massive left pleural effusion.
2)CT scan chest ([**2146-4-27**]):a.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
b. New moderate-to-large pericardial effusion. c. Interval
appearance of widespread airspace opacities throughout the
entire left lower lobe and the basal segments of the left upper
lobe and lingula. d. Slight interval decrease in size of right
middle lobe pulmonary nodule. e. Unchanged widespread
lymphadenopathy, consistent with history of CLL. f. Small right
pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
3) Echo ([**2146-4-28**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection
fraction 30 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a moderate to large sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. No
right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. However, there is
significant, accentuated respiratory variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired
ventricular filling. Also, there is brief, mild invagination of
both the right and left atrial free walls.
4) Echo ([**2146-4-29**]): 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. 2. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. 3. There is
moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. 4.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. 6. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 7. There is a
large pericardial effusion. There is brief right atrial
diastolic collapse. Post Window: 1. Effusion has been drained.
RA collapse is no longer seen. 2. Biventricular function is
unchanged from before

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28983**] was admitted under the medicine service and was
worked up for his shortness of breath. Chest x-ray on day of
admission revealed a massive left pleural effusion. Also on this
day he underwent a chest CT which revealed a new pericardial
effusion. Later on this day he underwent a left thoracentesis
and fluid was sent to cytology and micro. Broad spectrum
antibiotics were started. On [**4-28**] heme/onc was consulted d/t h/o
CLL. On [**4-29**] ID was consulted and he was brought to the OR for a
pericardial window. Please see operative report for details.
Fluid was also sent to cytology and micro. Following surgery he
was transferred to the PACU and later to the SDU for continued
care. Chest tube was removed several days after surgery. Initial
results from microbiology were that the pleural and pericardial
effusion were negative for microorganisms. And cytological
results were consistent with previously diagnosed chronic
lymphocytic leukemia. He was discharged on [**5-3**] with the
appropriate follow-up appointments, including f/u with heme/onc
for possible CLL treatment.
