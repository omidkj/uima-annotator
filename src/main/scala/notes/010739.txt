HOSPITAL COURSE:  (by issue)

#1.  The patient was in the Intensive Care Unit from the [**11-17**] through the [**11-21**].  Summary of the MICU
course, which is an abbreviated summary, is as follows:  For
acute renal failure he was gently hydrated and transfused.

prerenal azotemia due to his heart failure.  Foley catheter
was placed to follow inputs and outputs.  Weights were
followed.  Electrolytes were followed closely.  The renal
