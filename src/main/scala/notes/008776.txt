Pertinent Results:
MRI C-T-L spine
IMPRESSION:  Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical,
thoracic and lumbar spine as described above with severe
foraminal narrowing and canal stenosis at multiple levels.  No
evidence of epidural abscess seen.
.
Renal Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1. Perinephric fluid collection of unclear etiology. Correlation
with CT is recommended.
2. Pericholecystic fluid without evidence of gallbladder
dilatation or wall thickening is consistent with pericholecystic
edema secondary to impeded venous return (such as in portal
hypertension) or edema secondary to hypoproteinemia as in
anasarca.
3. Ascites.
.
CXR: [**2118-7-30**]
There is a left retrocardiac opacity and consolidation within
the left mid and lower lung fields.  There is mild improved
aeration at the right base.
Findings are most likely due to pulmonary edema as opposed to
focal
consolidation.  Left sided pleural effusion is also seen.  There
are no
pneumothoraces.
.
CXR: [**2118-7-28**]
IMPRESSION:  Increased interstitial markings most pronounced at
the lung
bases, which are nonspecific and may reflect atelectatic changes
but mild
pulmonary vascular congestion, or an atypical infection are not
excluded.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  A repeat
radiograph with improved inspiratory effort may be helpful for
further evaluation.
.
Chest CT [**2118-8-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Multifocal pneumonia.
2.  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations,
unchanged since CT abdomen and most likely reflecting areas of
atelectasis.
3.  Anasarca.
.
Echocardiogram [**2118-8-1**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic
valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Abd CT [**2118-7-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis.
2.  The previously noted perinephric fluid actually represents
perihepatic
fluid extending anterior to the right lobe of liver and inferior
to the left
lobe of liver.  Both kidneys are normal in appearance without
evidence of
pyelonephritis.  The constellation of bilateral pleural
effusions,
intra-abdominal fluid, and anasarca suggests fluid overload.
3.  Thick-walled bladder suggestive of cystitis.
4.  Moderately enlarged prostate.
.
Renal ultrasound [**2118-7-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Small amount to right perinephric fluid, which in the
setting of ascites
could represent fluid in [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch.
2.  Findings of right pleural effusion, ascites, GB mural edema,
distended IVC
all suggestive of cardiac decompensation/third spacing.
Correlate clinically.
.
MRI C/T/L Spin [**2118-7-28**]:
FINDINGS:

MR CERVICAL SPINE:  Cervical vertebrae appear normal in height,
marrow signal
intensity and alignment.  Craniocervical junction appears
normal.  There are
discogenic endplate changes seen at multiple levels, most
prominent at C4-C5.
The cervical spinal cord shows normal morphology and signal
intensity.

At C2-C3, there is no disc herniation, spinal canal or neural
foraminal
narrowing.

At C3-C4, there is posterior disc osteophyte complex indenting
the thecal sac
without significant spinal canal narrowing.  There is mild
bilateral neural
foraminal narrowing from uncovertebral and facet joint
osteophytes.

At C4-C5, there is posterior disc osteophyte complex effacing
the thecal sac
and remodeling the cervical spinal cord without focal cord
signal abnormality.
Uncovertebral and facet joint osteophy
