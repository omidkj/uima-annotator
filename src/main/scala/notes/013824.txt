History of Present Illness:
This 75 year old woman was recently diagnosed with right breast

cancer (stage 2 invasive ductal carcinoma) likely metastatic
given positive CT finding. There are plans for chemotherapy, and
she was referred for cardiology evaluation prior to beginning
treatment. She was found to have a positive stress test with
Pt is a poor historian, and her daughter reports that her
mother is short of breath all the time. With walking to the
bathroom or getting dressed, she easily is dyspneic. Her
daughter
believes this has been progressive over the years. The patient
also does admit to prior episodes of chest pressure. She sleeps

recliner

Pertinent Results:
Cath: [**2101-10-27**]
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this codominant circulation revealed
severe 2 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was very short
and instantly gave rise to the LAD, the LCX, and a large RI. The
LAD had a 60% hazy lesion at its ostium. The LCX had serial 90%
lesions at the ostium and in the proximal vessel. The RCA was a
relatively small vessel with a 20% ostial lesion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed only mildly elevated right and
left
heart filling pressures with an LVEDP of 12 mmHg, a mean PCW
pressure of 15 mmHg, and a mean RA pressure of 9 mmHg. The
cardiac output was
borderline low at 4.2 L/min. No gradient across the aortic valve
was
detected.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated preserved left ventricular

systolic wall motion with a calculated LVEF of 64%. No
significant
mitral regurgitation was seen.

CAth: [**2101-10-28**]
Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of LCx with mild jailing of OM1 but normal flow.
CAse complicated by failed Perclse device resulting in moderate
size hematoma and hypotension (SBP 60 mm Hg) and bradycardia
responive to IVF, atropine and brief infusion of dopamine. The
patient left the lab with the arteriotomy site under control,
with no evidence of active bleeding, asymptomatic except for
nausea and stable vital signs.

Left Foot XR - no evidence of inflammation, lytic lesion, joint
effusion, or fracture.

Femoral U/S - no pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula

LABORTORY:
Hct 36.3-->29.7 stable >24hrs
Cr 0.8, 2.1, 2.2, 1.6 (b/l 1.2)
TnT <0.01
FENa 1.7%, FeUrea 50%
UA no casts


Brief Hospital Course:
75 year-old woman recently dx with breast cancer undergoing
cardiac eval prior to have chemo Rx found to have abnormal ETT.
She underwent a left heart cath that found 2 vessel disease with
60% LAD and 90% LCx.  She underwent [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5303**] PCI of LCx
however it was complicated by a failed Perclose device and she
developed a significant groin hematoma with hypotension
requiring dopamine and IVF and monitoring in the CCU.  She was
quickly weaned from dopamine and transferred back to the floor.
Her Hct continued to slowly decrease however stabalized for
>48hrs prior to discharge without further expansion of her
hematoma.  Groin u/s showed no pseudoaneurysm or AVF.  She
remained pain free with nml cardiac biomarkers.

Her hospital course was also complicated by the development of
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with rates
in the 150's and worsening of her pulmonary edema.  SHe had no
prior history of atrial fibrillation and so was loaded on
amiodarone without TTE or anticoagulation.  She underwent
successful chemical cardioversion in less than 24 hours and
maintained sinus rhythm with PACs.  She is to be continued on
amiodarone and lopressor.  She will be discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of
Hearts Monitor with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as the ordering attending.

She does have relatively severe diastolic heart failure and
received IV hydration for cath and BP management.  She was
effectively controlled with diuresis and chemical cardioversion
of her single episode of atrial fibrillation.  She will require
her twice daily lasix and daily potassium replacement.

4 days post cath, she developed acute renal failure with a peak
creatinine of 2.2.  FENa and FEUrea supported an intrinsic vs.
obstructive pattern.  Her creatinine was decreasing on day of
admit.  She was never oliguric.  The etiology is likely
secondary to contrast nephrotoxicity.  Her baseline creatinine
is 1.2.  She will need qod blood draws to monitor her
creatinine, potssium, and hematocrit.

Antibiotics were initiated for her cough with a faint infiltrate
in the LLL.  She remained afebrile without a leukocytosis.
Becasue she will be starting chemotherapy for her metastatic
breast CA, we started levoquin 250mg qod (renal dosing) for a
total of 10 days of treatment (last day [**2101-11-8**]).
