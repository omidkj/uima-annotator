STUDIES:
Right knee bone:
1.  Bony fragments with prominent articular cartilage
degeneration.
2.  Abundant trilineage hematopoiesis is noted.  Iron stains are
negative.
.
cxr post op
Mild pulmonary edema, greater in the left lung and mediastinal
venous engorgement, it has worsened slightly since [**1-7**].
Asymmetric enlargement of the right pulmonary artery has been
present for many years. A CT angiogram of the chest on [**12-14**], [**2176**] showed this was due to a combination of enlarged lymph
nodes and pulmonary veins, with no pulmonary embolism. Heart
size is top normal. There is no appreciable pleural effusion or
indication of pneumothorax.
.
cxr: prior to d/c
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with the
patient in semi-erect position and analysis performed in direct
comparison with a similar previous chest examination of [**1-19**], [**2178**]. The lung fields are now clear, and no evidence of
significant congestion or acute parenchymal infiltrates is
noted. The lateral pleural sinuses are free. No pneumothorax is
present.

In comparison with the next previous study, the suggested
pulmonary edema pattern has normalized.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a 60 yo female who presents s/p R TKR for
respiratory monitoring.  Patient has diastolic heart failure and
had a prolonged course s/p her last surgery [**12-3**] with chf
exacerbation.
.
Post Op - received vancomycin for 24 hrs post op.  Treated
initially c hydromorphone PCA and then switched to oral
percocets.  Walking with PT on discharge.  Should be weaned off
percocets at rehab as tolerated.
.
Diastolic CHF- Her last echo [**1-3**] shows nl ef, but impaired
relaxation c/w diastolic hf. Her daily weights were monitored
and strict I/Os were kept.  She required some additional
diuresis with IV lasix.  On d/c she was well compensated with
good O2 sat on [**1-30**] L NC which is her baseline.
.
Rhythm- has episode of svt in [**2173**], and episode of avnrt in sicu
[**1-3**].  She was continued on her aspirin and monitored on
telemetry, her beta blocker was restarted for better rate
control.  During her admission, she had an episode of
tachycardia, an EKG was done suggestive of atrial flutter
