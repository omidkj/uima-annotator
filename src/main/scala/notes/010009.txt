Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old male with depressed LV function and
ESRD on dialysis who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-26**] with
witnessed syncope at dialysis. CPR was administered; from vague
report, it sounds as though he had an AED placed but was not in
shockable rhythm. He was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] and
continued to have runs of VT so transferred here for ICD. On
[**3-28**], he was noted to have a 12 beat run of NSVT. He has been
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for ICD placement. Of note, he was
dialyzed on Tues and WED this week so did not have dialysis
today, Thurs, one of his normal dialysis days. He was
transferred for ICD placement. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was noted
to be hypoxic with RA sats in low 80's, pleural effusion on
right crackles on left, JVP up.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2192-4-2**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size with moderate global hypokinesis.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
moderate global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin,
metabolic; cannot fully exclude multivessel CAD but less
likely). Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2184-8-2**], minimal aortic valve stenosis, symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension are now identified. Global left ventricular
systolic function appears similar. In the absence of a history
of hypertension, the presence of symmetric hypertrophy raises
the possibility of an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid).
.
CHEST CT ([**2192-4-2**]):
1. Multiple dense masses within complex large right effusion are
atypical in appearance for pleural tumor, more likely hematoma,
but malignancy is still the top diagnostic consideration. A
change in position with prone imaging would favor hematoma. If
not, transthoracic needle aspiration is indicated, and should be
feasible, for presumed mass.
2. Right middle and lower bronchial occlusion with possible
occlusive mass. Evaluation with contrast by CT (or MR if patient
cannot tolerate iodinated contrast) would be helpful.
3. Bilateral airspace consolidation, pneumonia or atelectasis.
4. Small volume of ascites.
.
CAROTID U/S ([**2192-4-2**]):
1. Left ICA - 100% occlusion
2. Right ICA - 40-59% occlusion


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 77 year old male with CAD s/p 5v CABG, ICM with
depressed LV function EF 30%, ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation,
CHB s/p PPM, initially transferred for ? ICD placement, found to
be in pulseless arrest and transferred to the CCU
post-resuscitation. Patient remains intubated and workup of
intrapulmonary issues are underway. Patient has collapsed right
lung with possible mass vs. hematoma, now s/p VATS and chest
tube placement.
.
1. PEA Arrest:  Initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible ICD
placement.  While in-house, had PEA arrest with possible
respiratory etiology. Telemetry showed inability of PPM to
capture during code possibly due to metabolic derangement vs.
pacer lead dislodgement. EP interrogated pacer and believes lead
is in place - increased voltage that pacer lead is putting out.
During the code, the patient was intubated. Patient remained
intubated for a prolonged period but with improved mental status
when off sedation. Neurology signed off. He was continued on
amiodarone for h/o VT. He will continue on 400 mg of amiodarone
for 1 more week then decrease to 200 mg daily thereafter.
.
2. Hypotension: This was initially felt likely secondary to
aspiration pneumonia/hospital acquired pneumonia for he
completed a course of antibiotics.  Over the course of his
hospital stay, he had persistent pressor requirements.
Ultimately this was felt to be due to a combination of poor
inotropy from his cardiomyopathy and from poor peripheral
vascular tone from his diabetes and renal failure.  For this
combination, he was started on digoxin and midodrine with
adequate stablization of his blood pressures.
.
3. Respiratory failure:
Admitted s/p respiratory arrest c/b PEA. Unclear whether initial
respiratory event precipitated his cardiac arrest. Etiology
likely multifactorial including baseline COPD, large R pleural
effusion, collapsed R lung due to possible lung mass.
Bronchoscopy unable to obtain tissue for diagnosis. Now s/p
VATS, tissue biopsy on [**4-10**]. VATS revealed thickened parietal
pleura and dense fibrothorax. Within dense fibrothorax there was
400cc of old blood which was evacuated. Gram stain negative,
biopsies sent to path, cytology and micro. He completed rx with
Vanco/Zosyn x 14 days for post obstructive/aspiration pneumonia.
He was kept intubated for a prolonged period because of
overbreathing each time an SBT has been performed. After the
VATS, he was tolerating PS 18/5. Pulmonary was also consulted at
this point and performed another SBT which the patient tolerated
with improvement in his ABG.  At this point a decision was made
to extubate the patient on [**4-12**].  He tolerated the extubation
initially, however after 2 hours he became progressively more
tachypneic and hypoxic with Os sats 90% on 100% oxygen.  ABG at
this time revealed a significa
