Chief Complaint:
difficulty breathing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27548**] is a 77M with extensive PMH including CHF, CAD c/b
MI, DMII, lung cancer s/p VATS, and ESRD s/p kidney transplant
in [**2104**] (on immunosuppresion), who presents from clinic with
pneumonia, new thrombocytopenia and hyperkalemia.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 27548**] was diagnosed with a UTI in [**9-/2116**] and was treated
with Ciprofloxacin x7 days. He then became ill one week ago with
upper respiratory symptoms including congestion and cough
productive of phlegm streaked with blood which has evolved into
phlegm with clots. He has noted some epistaxis with dripping
down the back of his throat. He also noticed atraumatic bruises
over his extremities over the past two days. He has had diarrhea
for 7-10 days all prompting him to be evaluated today at [**Company 191**] and
was found to have a new pneumonia. He was started on
levofloxacin and sent home. His labs returned with a critical
value with platets of 22 and creatinine of 7.3. He was notified
and asked to be evaluated in the ED.
.
Review of systems also positive for air hunger and anxiety
related to his feeling of being unable to get enough air. He
also endorses a decreased appettite. However, he denies N/V,
hematemsis, F/C, HA. He denies any medication non-compliance,
new medications or supplements.  He follows with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 805**], who Mr. [**Known lastname 27548**] saw "a few months ago."
.
recently, patient has been having difficulty breathing,
described as inability to get air in. Increased bruising noted
over the past two days. Nosebleeding also noted. Diarrhea on and
off for the past 7-10 days. No fevers, chills, hematochezia,
hematuria, dysuria, gum bleeding, melena
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 97.7 84 120/44 24 96% RA. CXR showed
RLL/RML pneumonia. Sputum cx, urine cx, blood cx sent. For the
hyperkalemia he was given kayexalate x1, insulin 10 u x2, 1 amp
d50, calcium gluconate. He was guaiac negative.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is tachypneic, restless and obviously
uncomfortable. He is tripoding to help make his breathing more
comfortable.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, all else negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27548**] is a 77 year old male with extensive history
including heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease
complicated by myocardial infarction (CAD c/b MI), diabetes
mellitus, type 2 (DMT2), lung cancer status post VATS, and end
stage renal disease (ESRD) status post kidney transplant in [**2104**]
(on immunosuppresion), who presented from clinic with pneumonia,
new thrombocytopenia and hyperkalemia.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Ultimately, the cause of his
acute renal failure was not found.  It was suspected that he had
a TTP/HUS-like syndrome or possibly ATN from sepsis which he
never recovered from.  A renal biopsy of his transplanted kidney
did not show acute graft rejection, blood vessel thrombosis, or
other pathologic diagnoses.  His ADAMSTS13 was indeterminate.
He was tried on CVVH and CRRT for dialysis, however, he was
ultimately unable to maintain euvolemia with this and was
continuing to have pulmonary edema resulting in respiratory
failure.  His immunosuppression (rapamune and cellcept) was
discontinued when it became clear that his kidneys were not
recovering and his thrombocytopenia was worsening.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Cause was never discovered.  As discussed
above, it is possible that he had a TTP/HUS-like syndrome,
sepsis, or a smoldering DIC.  ITP was also on the differential.
His hemolysis labs showed a mixed picture with largely normal
total bilirubin and haptoglobin, variable fibrinogen sometimes
under 100, and elevated LDH.  He was tried on plasmapheresis x3
for possible TTP, however this did not raise his platelets.
Then, he was given a trial of prednisone for possible TTP/HUS,
which worked for only one day and was confounded by platelet
transfusions at the same time.  Finally, his immunosuppression
was held to let his bone marrow replace the platelets, which
showed potential with a reticulocyte count of >7.  He continued
to have bleeding through pulmonary hemorrhage

Differential diagnosis includes TTP/HUS vs. sepsis vs. acute
rejection, graft thrombosis. Likely source of infection is
urinary with a UA positive. In terms of TTP/HUS, he has anemia,
thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. He has been on prednisone
chronically and may be playing a role in suppression of his
fever response in the case of TTP/HUS and sepsis. His peripheral
morphology shows occassional schisotcytes. LDH is elevated
(though the sample was slightly hemolyzed). He has had symptoms
of diarrhea for 7-10 days though non-blo
