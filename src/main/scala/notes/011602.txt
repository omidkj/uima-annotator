Chief Complaint:

Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(LIMA to LAD, SVG to Diag,

Left heart catheterization and coronary angiography

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 63-year-old female with a long-standing
history of hypertension.  During a recent ER evaluation, she
underwent a chest CT scan that was notable for a very large
aneurysm and dilatation of the ascending and descending thoracic
aorta.  The ascending aorta measured upwards of 5.2 x 4.8 cm
while the descending aorta measured 7 x 2 x 7.0 cm.  The aorta
tapered to a more normal caliber at the levels of renal
arteries. CT was also significant for a large amount of mural
thrombus in the descending thoracic aorta. There was no evidence
of contrast extravasation or rupture.  The CT scan was also
significant for coronary artery calcifications and left adrenal
adenoma. On the day of admission, she was seen at the cardiac
surgical clinic. During her visit, she was very hypertensive
with blood pressures in the 160's mmHg systolic over 100's mmHg
diastolic. Given the dimensions of her aneurysm and uncontrolled
hypertension, it was decided to admit her for blood pressure
management along with further preoperative evaluation and urgent
surgical intervention.

Pertinent Results:
[**2143-10-21**] Chest CTA:
CT ANGIOGRAM: Not significant change in the previously described
massive aneurysmal dilatation of the entire ascending and
descending thoracic aorta, including the arch. There is mild
compression of the main right and left pulmonary arteries by the
large descending aortic aneurysm. Large amount of mural thrombus
is associated with the descending aortic aneurysm. There is no
evidence of contrast extravasation or rupture. Intimal wall
calcifications identified throughout the aorta. The abdominal
aorta measures 36 cm in diameter at the level of take off of
celiac artery. Atherosclerotic calcifications seen throughout
the aorta. The origins of celiac, SMA, renals (single
bilaterally), and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent. Iliac arteries are widely
patent. 3D measurements are as follows: aortic root: 34 x 30 mm,
ascending aorta: 51 x 47 mm, aortic arch: 61 x 48 mm descending
aorta (maximum): 85 x 72 mm, lower descending aorta: 37 x 34 mm
CT CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:
A 8 x 5 mm hypodense nodule is seen in the right thyroid lobe.
Diffusecoronary artery calcifications are again seen. There is
no pleural effusion. Minimal atelectasis is seen at the left
base. Low-attenuation nodule again seen in the left adrenal
gland, most consistent with adrenal adenoma. Liver, spleen,
pancreas, adrenal, kidneys, uterus and urinary bladder are
unremarkable.

[**2143-10-21**] Transthoracic ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is markedly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is markedly dilated with extrinsic
compression of the left atrial free wall The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent preoperative evaluation
which included cardiac catheterization, echocardiogram and chest
CT angiogram. Cardiac catheterization was done to reveal
significant disease . Atenolol was switched to Labetolol while
she intermittently required IV Hydralazine to maintain systolic
blood pressures in the 120mmHg range. Her preoperative workup
was notable for a positive urinalysis for which she was
empirically started on Ciprofloxacin. Unfortunately, she went on
to develop a drug rash which delayed surgery for several days.
The dermatology service was consulted, and she was eventually
cleared for surgery.

On [**10-30**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed replacement of her total
arch and ascending aorta(elephant trunk), along with four vessel
coronary artery bypass grafting. For surgical details, please
see seperate dictated operative note. She weaned from bypass
with neosynephrine and propofol.

Following the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact, weaned from pressor and was extubated without incident.

She was subsequently transferred to the floor for further
recovery.  Her BP was controlled with high dose beta blockade
and ACE inhibitors.  She was diuresed to preop weight and
mobilized.  Due to tacycardia despite metoprolol an echo was
done, which revealed no pericardial effusion and preserved LV
function.

A speech and swallowing evaluation was done due to continued
complaints of odynophagia and dysphagia to liquids. She was
found to have aspiration with use of a straw and told to avoid
these.  Should her problems persist for more than a couple more
weeks, ENT evaluation will be undertaken.

With BP controlled and her strength returning, she was deemed
ready for discharge which she was anxious for.  Medications,
instructions and follow-up were discussed with her prior to
release.
