HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old female
with history of type 2 diabetes on insulin, history of
postoperative pulmonary embolus in [**2158-10-24**] complicated
by a retroperitoneal bleed while on anticoagulation and an
IVC filter, who reports a one month history of non compliance
with medications including insulin secondary to difficulty
getting around and secondary to a glucometer which is not
working.  The patient describes difficulty getting around due
to neuropathy and imbalance and gait unsteadiness.  However,
what prompted the patient to present to the Emergency Room on
the night of [**7-30**] was a history of right sided chest pain
which radiated to the back and shortness of breath.  Both
symptoms worsened when the patient started to ambulate short
distances from her couch to her door.  Usually at baseline
the patient can walk greater than one block without
difficulty.  Her symptoms improved and resolved with rest.
They were not related to position and not accompanied by
diaphoresis.  The chest pain was pleuritic in nature but
somewhat similar to what she felt when she had her prior
pulmonary embolus.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for dysuria, frequency and
nausea, no vomiting, no fevers, chills, cough, no bright red
blood per rectum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Obsessive compulsive disorder,
neurotic excoriations, insulin dependent diabetes,
obstructive sleep apnea on bipap, obesity, CVA which has
since resolved.  She initially had left sided weakness, now
she has trace left lower extremity weakness.  Retinopathy,
gastroparesis, pulmonary embolus in 10/96.  Pulmonary embolus
was complicated by a large left retroperitoneal bleed.  While
on anticoagulation the patient also had chest pain at that
time.  She was taken to cath which was negative for coronary
artery disease.  Status post [**Location (un) 260**] filter.
Hypertension.  Pulmonary hypertension.  Restless leg
syndrome.  Fibromyalgia with low back pain.  Atypical chest
pain, echocardiogram which was done in 7/98 showed mild left
atrial abnormality, normal left ventricular, right
ventricular size, mild mitral regurg, mild pulmonary systolic
hypertension, patient is status post cholecystectomy, status
post appendectomy, status post total abdominal hysterectomy,
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, status post TIA.  Status
post rectocele and enterocele repair in [**2162-1-23**].

MEDICATIONS:  Include Imipramine 25 mg q h.s., Depakote
50/100, Buspar 30 mg [**Hospital1 **], Prilosec 40 mg, Detrol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **],
Vioxx 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], Nortriptyline 25 mg once a day, Neurontin
400 mg q h.s., Carbidopa Levodopa 3 tablets at night, NPH
insulin 50 units in the morning, 40 units at bedtime, Regular
insulin 20 units in the morning, 20 units with supper.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced, has one daughter
that lives downstairs, lives with a [**Doctor Last Name **] child.  She is a
former smoker, about a little bit less than three packs per
day for 25 years.  She quit 20 years ago.  She is on
disability and does not drink alcohol.  Has never used any
illicit drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Room the patient's
vitals were temperature 99.3, heart rate 120-130, not
orthostatic, blood pressure 150/70, respiratory rate 17, O2
saturation 97%.  In general the patient was a pleasant, obese
female in no apparent distress lying flat on the gurney on 2
liters nasal cannula.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat,
normocephalic, atraumatic, mucus membranes slightly dry,
pupils anicteric, pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Neck supple with normal carotid upstroke, no bruits, no
jugulovenous distension, however, this was difficult to
assess due to her obesity.  Cardiovascular with tachycardic
rate, normal rhythm, questionable 1/6 systolic flow murmur.
Chest exam clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
Abdomen, soft, obese, positive bowel sounds, intermittent
mild tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant, no
rebound.  Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema, no
palpable cords, good peripheral pulses, 2+ peripheral pulses
in dorsalis pedis bilaterally.  Neuro exam, the patient was
alert and oriented times four to person, place and time times
three.  Normal finger to nose.  The patient with appropriate
cranial nerves II through XII intact, [**5-28**] muscle strength in
all four extremities with 4+/5 strength on her extension of
her left hip and knee.  She had downgoing plantar reflexes
bilaterally and her skin showed multiple excoriated lesions
with granulation tissue on the right wrist, left upper arm,
left anterior chest wall and periumbilical excoriations
largest of which was 1 by 1.5 inches with a 6 by 3 inch area
of well demarcated erythema.  No purulence or exudates were
seen.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count 10.5,
hemoglobin 15.2, hematocrit 45.6, platelet count 237,000,
sodium 132, potassium 4.4, chloride 98, CO2 12, BUN 15,
creatinine 0.6, blood sugar 285, anion gap 22, CK 35,
troponin I 0.3, Lactate 1.  ABG was done which showed a PH of
7.29, CO2 30, O2 74 on two liters nasal cannula.  Urinalysis
1.031 specific gravity, cloudy, positive for blood, negative
for nitrite, greater than 300 protein, greater than 1,000
glucose and greater than 80 ketones, 122 white blood cells,
occasional bacteria.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 120
beats per minute, normal axis, normal interval, T wave
inversions in lead 1, AVL, T wave flattening in V5 through
V6, slightly more pronounced then an EKG compared on [**2163-1-28**].  Chest x-ray, PA and lateral, showed no effusions,
normal cardiac mediastinal borders, no infiltrates,
degenerative changes in the right acromioclavicular joints
which are not knew.  MR of the head was done in 11/99, showed
multiple areas of high signal within the cerebral white
matter stable, consistent with small vessel ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Endocrine:  The diabetic ketoacidosis that the patient was
admitted for most likely due to her discontinuing her NPH and
Regular Insulin regimen for the last month and possibly also
due to an acute UTI that the patient had or possibly an acute
coronary syndrome.  The DKA subsequently resolved with volume
depletion and insulin drip which was subsequently changed to
her normal insulin dose of subcu insulin.  Her electrolytes
were monitored closely at this time and repleted as needed.

For the patient's chest pain which was atypical, there were
nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  Given the hypoxia and the
shortness of breath and a history of prior PE, the patient
had a CT angio of the chest which was negative for pulmonary
embolus.  CKs and troponins were also drawn to rule out an MI
although there was no evidence of coronary artery disease on
the previous cath five years ago by report.

For the patient's urinary tract infection, the patient was
given a 7 day course for a complicated UTI due to the fact
that the patient also had a co-morbidity of diabetes
mellitus.  The patient was treated with Ciprofloxacin 250 mg
[**Hospital1 **] for cellulitis.  The blood sugar was controlled to
promote better healing.  The patient was also given
Dicloxacillin for coverage of anti-staphylococcus aureus.

Psychiatry was consulted as well for her multiple psychiatric
issues.  They recommended an outpatient follow-up visit
because she was not currently suicidal, did not have any
suicidal ideation.

For the patient's obstructive sleep apnea the bi-pap was
continued.  The patient was stabilized and discharged on her
regular insulin dose.  Her anion gap subsequently resolved
over her hospital stay and the patient was given a
prescription for antibiotics on discharge for her urinary
tract infection.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Diabetic ketoacidosis.
2.  Urinary tract infection.
3.  Atypical chest pain.
