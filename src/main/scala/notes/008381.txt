Chest CTA [**6-15**]: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS
CONTRAST: There are multiple lymph nodes seen within the
anterior mediastinum, specifically the pretracheal region,
aortopulmonary window, and prevascular spaces. No axillary or
hilar lymphadenopathy is identified. There are bilateral
alveolar air-space opacities located primarily centrally,
however, there are also some dependent areas that are also
opacified. While this patient has a history of pulmonary
hemorrhage, the central distribution and symmetrical pattern of
these opacities is more typical of ARDS or diffuse pneumonia.
There is no focal source of bleeding identified. These airspace
opacities are superimposed on an interstitial lung disease
displaying thickened septae and mild diffuse areas of
bronchiectasis. The airways are patent to the subsegmental
bronchi bilaterally. Coils are seen adjacent to the right main
bronchus, presumably from the patient's recent angiography
procedure. The patient is intubated, and an NG tube is seen
coursing into the stomach, terminating in the gastric antrum.
The visualized lung, spleen, and pancreas are unremarkable. No
dissection within the aorta or pulmonary embolus within the
pulmonary artery is identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral, central, primarily symmetrical air-space opacity
with some dependent component which is most likely pulmonary
hemorrhage with a possible ARDS or diffuse pneumonia component.
This process is superimposed on a background of interstitial
lung disease as seen on the prior CT.

2. Coils seen adjacent to the right main bronchus, as patient is
status post pulmonary angiography procedure. No focal source of
bleeding identified on the CT scan

Pulmonary angio:Bronchial artery embolization of second and
third order branches off the right bronchial artery to the right
upper and middle lobes, embolized with coils.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the MICU and placed on antibiotics for
pneumonia.  It was felt that his hemoptysis was due to his
bronchiectasis and interstitial lung disease.  The morning after
admission, he began having spontaneous bleeding into the ETT.
He had a bronchoscopy that demonstrated bleeding from the RUL
and RLL.  He was taken to IR and underwent embolization of 2nd
and 3rd order branches of the R bronchial artery.  He developed
ARDS.  He was paralyzed to minimize the possibility of coughing
episodes that would cause subsequent bleeding.  An esophageal
balloon was placed to monitor transpulmonary pressure.  He
remained hypoxemic.  He underwent 2 subsequent bronchoscopies on
[**6-17**] and [**6-18**] which revealed thick secretions with blood, but no
active bleeding.  He then developed afib with RVR and
hypotension.  He was cardioverted with transient response to
NSR.  Amiodarone was loaded and he was cardioverted again, this
time staying in NSR.  He had a PA catheter placed to further
evaluate his hypotension, which revealed RV pressures 49/17, PA
pressures 57/39, and wedge 22.  SVR 450, CO 4.5.   He developed
SQ air felt secondary to barotrauma, so his PEEP was decreased.
CXR did not demonstrate tension ptx.  Because of worsening
hypoxemia, he was proned, with mild improvement.  He developed
ARF, creatinine went from 1.0 to 2.3.  On [**6-19**], a family meeting
was held regarding goals of care given his overwhelming
respiratory failure.  His fiance agreed that he would want to be
kept comfortable.  He was made CMO, and died one hour later with
his family by his side.
