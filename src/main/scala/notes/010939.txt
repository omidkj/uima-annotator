Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
PEG tube placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of
hypertension, dementia, and hyperlipidemia who presented with
decreased level of arousal on morning day of admission. The
patient normally speaks English (although it is her second
language) but starting 2 days PTA, the patient began speaking
only Yiddish (which is her native language). She was noted to be
"confused" and less responsive to verbal stimuli (normally can
hold a conversation). She has been increasingly lethargic with a
poor PO intake and on the day of admission was unresponsive to
any commands. She also was experiencing difficulty breathing for
the 2 days PTA and had a CXR showed "bibasilar infiltrates and
vascular congestion"--for which she was started on levofloxacin
and given lasix.

Here in the ED, the patient was noted to be saturating in the
low 80's on room air and with a weak gag reflex--she was
intubated for airway protection. An EKG shows the patient to be
in new-onset atrial fibrillation.

Admission neurologic exam, revealed asymmetry of movement (less
on right), right facial droop, mutism, and a lethargic mental
status. Her imaging showed an ischemic lesion in the left
parietal region.  Given her history of recent onset atrial
fibrillation she was presumed to have a cardioembolic event that
lead to her stroke.

[**2176-6-20**]: Non-contrast head CT.
FINDINGS: There is a large area of cytotoxic edema in the left
parietal lobe, extending centrally towards the lateral
ventricle. This is consistent with an evolving infarction. There
is mild associated mass effect. There is no shift of normally
midline structures. There is no acute hemorrhage. There is no
hydrocephalus. The visualized osseous structures appear
unremarkable.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 1:30 p.m. on [**2176-6-20**].
IMPRESSION: Evolving left parietal infarction.

[**2176-6-21**]:
MRI OF THE HEAD: There is restricted slow in the area of the
abnormality identified on the previous CT in the left
temporoparietal lobe consistent with acute infarction. There is
increased T2/FLAIR signal within this region also indicating
this infarct is at least a few days old. There are also a few
small foci within the right cerebellum, which also show slow
diffusion and T2/FLAIR hyperintensity, likely representing
further small areas of acute infarction. There are multiple foci
of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the periventricular and
subcortical regions of both cerebral hemispheres, likely related
to chronic small vessel ischemia. Some of these areas show foci
of susceptibility artifact consistent with small areas likely
old hemorrhage. There are no mass lesions or shift of normally
midline structures.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: The major tributaries of the circle
of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent. There are no areas of significant stenosis
or aneurysmal dilatation identified. Note is made of dominance
of the right vertebral artery with lack of the left vertebral
artery seen.
IMPRESSION:
1) Large area of slow diffusion within the left temporoparietal
lobe consistent with an acute infarct as seen on the previous
CT. There are T2/FLAIR signal abnormalities in this region also.
2) Small foci of slow diffusion within the right cerebellum
indicative of further areas of infarction.
3) Unremarkable MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].

TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The right atrium is moderately  dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
 cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size  and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is  seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate  thickening of
the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe  [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is a trivial/physiologic  pericardial effusion.

CXR [**2176-6-26**]:
FINDINGS: Since the previous examination dated [**2176-6-22**],
there has been removal of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric
tube. The appearance of cardiomegaly and left atrial enlargement
is unchanged. There are calcifications at the mitral annulus
again noted. Interval increase in moderate to large left pleural
effusion and small right pleural effusion. Slight increase in
the interstitial lung markings suggestive of increasing
interstitial edema may correlate to the removal of the
endotracheal tube. No pneumothorax. The osseous structures
appear unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Left temporoparietal lobe infarction/Stroke: The patient was
admitted to the Neuro ICU on admission.  She was intubated and
ventilated for the first six hospital days. She was maintained
on aspirin for secondary stroke prophylaxis. All of her of
antihypertensive medications were held in order to maximize
cerebral perfusion pressure.  She remained in the Neuro ICU for
one week where she would intermittently open her eyes to voice.
Her right-sided hemiparesis persisted and she remained aphasic.
On [**6-24**] the patient had a PEG tube placed and she was extubated
without difficulty.  From a neurologic standpoint, she declined
after transfer to the floor, shortly after developing a
pneumonia after extubation.  From this point onwa
