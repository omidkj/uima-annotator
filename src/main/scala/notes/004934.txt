Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 year old female with chronic diastolic heart
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
bilateral pleural effusions status post pleurex cathether
placement in [**2-14**], diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and anemia
who precented from [**Hospital **] rehab with acute respiratory failure.
 She had been at [**Hospital **] Rehab after a prolonged admission [**Last Name (un) 5355**]
CHF and pleural effusions requiring pleurex catheter placement.
Her effusions were transudative and thought to be due to her
CHF. Her medical regimen was optimized and she was sent to
rehab.

At rehab she had been doing well except for a fall complicated
by a left hip fracture and was awaiting ORIF at the time of her
presentation here. She had also received 2 units PRBCs for
anemia during her stay and had her left sided pleurex catheter
removed on [**3-24**] after pleurodesis and reported talc therapy.
There was also report of a recent CT scan prior to admission
noting a right pleural effusion with question of loculations.
On the morning of transfer, she was noted to be tachypneic and
in respiratory distress. ABG was 7.28/69/87. She was put on
BiPAP with improvement. Thoracentesis was attempted but fluid
could not be removed so she was given lasix 120mg IV x1 and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

On arrival to the MICU, she was on a NRB and somnolent, not
arousable to stimuli. BiPAP was initiated and CXR was performed.
She was started on vancomycin and aztreonam and ruled out for
influenza. She improved rapidly and was oxygenating normally on
room air.

Review of Systems: Negative except per HPI.

transudative during last admission) s/p pleurex catheter
placement on L  in [**2163-2-6**].

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2163-3-25**]:
Bilateraly pulm infiltrates with small bilat pleural effusions,
and mild pulm edema. Effusions intervally improved since last
study.

EKG: NSR 93 bpm, nl axis and intervals. Good R wave progression.
No significant change from prior dated [**2163-2-6**].

[**2163-3-30**]   Radiology  CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
1. More loculated moderate bilateral pleural effusion, slightly
decreased in size on the right, unchanged on the left with new
dense opacities, probably due to talc injection in the
intervall. 2. Diffuse septal thickening and ground-glass
opacity, likely due to pulmonary edema. 3. Enlarging mediastinal
lymph nodes, likely reactive. 4. Patent left lower lobe bronchus
with improved aeration of the left lower lobe, but persistent
peripheral opacities and atelectasis.   5. Extensive coronary
artery calcification, mitral annulus and aortic annulus
calcifications. 6. Clips in the left breast and left axillary
region, likely due to prior
breast cancer. Prior vertebroplasty. 7. Small hiatal hernia.

[**2163-3-28**]   Radiology HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS
Fluoroscopic images show placement of a gamma nail and metallic
plate transfixing previously described comminuted fracture of
the inner trochanteric region with apparent separation of the
lesser trochanter. Further information can be gathered from the
operative report.


Brief Hospital Course:
84F with CHF, COPD who sustained a hip fracture and pneumonia
after pleuodesis/pleurx placement for chronic pleural effusions,
now s/p ORIF on [**3-28**].

DELIRIUM: Patient with delirium in setting of morphine use, mild
hypoxia, and hosptialization for hip fracture. Currently
improved after mimized narcotics, antipsychotics as needed,
continued reorientation, low dose Quetiapine for sleep.
Geriatrics followed.

PNEUMONIA and HYPOXIA: Patient presented with acute hypoxia
likely related to volume overload and pneumonia. She lives in [**Location **]
and thus is at risk for MRSA. Acute decompensation in the
setting of leukocytosis and bilateral pulmonary infiltrate
consistent with healthcare assoc pneumonia. She was treated with
Vanc/levofloxacin for 7 day course to [**4-2**]. Viral respiratory
panel prelim result was negative. A repeat CT showed effusions
to be not increased in size from prior. Per IP consulatants,
likely will not benefit from thoracentesis. O2 sat remained in
80's on room air but easily rose to low 90's on 1L of room air.
Continued hypoxia presumed due to a degree of persistent heart
failure exacerbation.

CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: She has diastolic heart failure
with an EF of 80% on [**1-17**]. She was volume overloaded on exam and
x-ray on transfer from the ICU. She responded well to two days
of 40 mg twice daily IV lasix. Diuresis was limited by renal
function. As hydralizine and afterload reduction has no
demonstrated role in the treatment of diastolic heart failure
and is difficult to take because of frequent dosing, this
medication was stopped. She was started on an increased dose of
metoprolol.  She will also be discharged on a slightly increased
furosemide dose of 60 mg PO BID.

HIP FRACTURE: She tolerated ORIF on [**3-28**] very well, with a plate
and gamma nail placed.  She was anticoagulated with lovenox.
Physical therapy evaluated.  She will be discharged to acute
rehab for further PT/OT.  She may weight bear as tolerated per
orthopedics.

COPD: At baseline, with ABG evidence of chronic retention.  She
was continued on bronchodilators and given oxygen with goal sat
89-92.  She was unable to get back down to room air during this
admission so will be discharged on 1L O2 by nasal cannula.
Expectation is she may be able to be advanced back to room air
with further gently diuresis.

CKD: She is at her baseline of [**12-9**].3.  Medications were renally
dosed and Cr. remained stable.

MEDIASTINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY: She was noted to have mediastinal
lymphadenopathy at her presentation that was considered most
likely due to reactive lymphadenopathy secondary to her
pneumonia.  This should be followed up with a repeat scan in [**2-11**]
months.

DIABETES TYPE 2: She was continued on glargine and a humalog
sliding scale.

HTN: She was continued on her metoprolol on isosorbide.

FEN: She received a regular/heart healthy diet.

PROPHYLAXIS: lovenox, PPI, bowel regimen

Access: Midline was discontinued,  PIV
