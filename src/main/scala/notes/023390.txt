HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 47 year old female
with three days of a headache which she described as severe
in her right frontal area.  She had dinner the day prior to
admission, went to sleep and when she awoke in the morning
she started vomiting and her frontal headache was worse.  The
headache continued actually two days prior to admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Chronic hepatitis.

Hypertension.

Recent twenty pound weight loss.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was pleasant in no
distress.  The pupils are equal, round and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  The
lungs were clear bilaterally.  Cardiac regular rate and
rhythm.  The abdomen was soft, nontender.  Extremities
without edema.  Neurologically, she was awake, alert and
oriented times three, no drift.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are intact.  Her strength was five throughout both upper
and lower extremities.  Sensation was intact to light touch.

She had a negative head CT but had a positive lumbar
puncture.  She was sent immediately to the Neurodiagnostic
Suite to have angiogram to rule out an aneurysm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Her initial head CT was not significant for
blood, did not show blood, however, lumbar puncture showed
xanthochromia.  She subsequently went to have a CT with
contrast which suggested the presence of a posterior
communicating artery aneurysm.  While being prepped for
anesthesia, she complained of a severe headache and lost
consciousness.  She was intubated, underwent placement of an
external ventricular drain which showed low opening pressure.
It was felt that the episode was most likely possible seizure
as a result of either a repeated rupture of an aneurysm or a
mass effect.  She underwent a diagnostic cerebral angiogram
at that time which showed a ruptured left posterior
communicating artery, narrow necked, aneurysm.  It was
treated successfully using endovascular embolization with no
iatrogenic complications and no distal branch occlusion.
Postoperatively, she was brought to the Intensive Care Unit
where she had significant strict hemodynamic parameters of a
blood pressure between 110 and 150.  She was loaded with
Dilantin due to the possibility that she had a seizure prior
to the angiogram.  Her ventriculostomy drain was kept at 12
and she was kept intubated overnight.  A central line was
placed for possible triple H therapy.  On her first
postoperative day, she opened eyes to command, moved all four
extremities.  Her blood pressure was kept between 103 to 133
and her central venous pressure was three to seven and her
ICP was eight to twelve overnight.  She was extubated and
given two units of packed red blood cells for her hematocrit
of 25.9.  On her first postoperative day, she did develop a
fever of 101.7.  She had multiple blood cultures, urine
cultures, cerebrospinal fluid cultures which were all
negative.  Also, she had Dopplers which were negative and a
chest x-ray which showed no pneumonia.  She remained
neurologically intact during this time.  She did receive an
infectious disease consultation.  Infectious disease
recommended changing her antibiotic therapy to start on
Ceftazidime two grams q8hours and Vancomycin one gram
q12hours and to check daily cerebrospinal fluid and monitor
her Vancomycin peak and trough.  Also during this time, we
ask hepatology to see the patient requiring her chronic
hepatitis C.  They recommended holding her antiviral therapy
until she was more clinically stable.  On [**2162-9-7**], her
examination remains unchanged.  She always remained awake,
alert and oriented times three.  No pronator drift,
symmetrical smile.  She was started on Albumin 50 four times
a day in order to increase her albumin and to give her triple
H therapy, blood pressure in the 160 to 70 range for her
triple H and central venous pressure in the range of eight.
Her ICPs remained anywhere from eight to thirteen and again
she was neurologically intact.  She did have a drop in her
hematocrit on [**2162-9-8**], to 23.0 which had been previously
29.0 the day before.  Hematology was still following the
patient and they questioned whether it could have been from
her ribavirin use prior to her admission versus an abdominal
collection.  Later on [**2162-9-8**], she received two units of
packed red blood cells, increasing her hematocrit to 31.4.
On [**2162-9-9**], there was a question that she had a reaction
to fresh frozen plasma.  She was given Benadryl and Solu-
Medrol.  She had worsening shortness of breath with a low
saturation and wheezes on examination.  A chest x-ray showed
question of congestive heart failure and she did improve with
Lasix.  She still continued to spike fevers through
[**2162-9-9**].  All her cultures continued to remain negative.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was done to rule out
endocarditis which was negative also.  On [**2162-9-7**], her
Dilantin was discontinued due to the possibility it was
causing her fevers.  She was started on Valproic Acid.  She
continued having fevers through [**2162-9-10**], where her last
fever was 102.7 on [**2162-9-10**], and then on [**2162-9-11**], she
became afebrile.  She was then two days off her Dilantin and
her cultures had remained negative.  Her ventriculostomy
drain had been weaned and she tolerated the weaning process.
It was discontinued on [**2162-9-12**].  She had a head CT which
did not show hydrocephalus.  On [**2162-9-13**], her blood
pressure parameters were liberalized.  Her triple H therapy
was decreased.  Blood pressure range was now 140 to 160.  On
[**2162-9-14**], she was transferred to the surgical floor.  She
remained neurologically awake, alert and oriented times
three.  Strength remained intact.  She was afebrile, able to
ambulate with assistance.  Her Foley was discontinued and her
intravenous fluids were decreased to 100 per hour.  She was
slowly weaned from her triple H therapy.  She was seen by
physical therapy and felt to be safe to be discharged home.
Prior to being discharged home on [**2162-9-19**], her sutures
were removed from her drain site.  She was given discharge
instructions to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in two weeks, to
report any significant headaches, fevers, any changes
neurologically.
