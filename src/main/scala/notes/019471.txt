Past Medical History:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented in early [**6-/2197**] with fever, weight loss, and
muscle and joint aches. He was diagnosed with PMR and started on
prednisone with improvement in his symptoms. During the
preceding six months, he reported a history of shoulder, neck
and quadriceps pain as well as fatigue, weakness and poor
appetite. He reported periodic fevers, drenching night sweats
and a 25-pound weight loss also over the same six months. With
initiation of his prednisone at 20 mg daily, he noted marked
improvement of both his musculoskeletal
and constitutional symptoms. He then presented to the emergency
room on [**2197-7-17**] with palpitations and dizziness and was found
to be in atrial fibrillation. He had a history of PAF in the
past. He was febrile to 101.6 with a heart rate of 126. CT scan
of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on [**2197-7-19**] showed multiple
low-attenuation lesions within the liver, spleen, and kidneys.
On [**2197-7-20**], MRI of the abdomen showed hypovascular masses in
both kidneys and spleen of various sizes consistent with
lymphoma. A CT-guided biopsy of the spleen on [**2197-7-21**] was
nondiagnostic. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] bone marrow aspirate and
biopsy on [**2197-7-26**], which showed extensive necrosis with focal
involvement by high-grade B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell
type. FISH translocation was notable for c-Myc and Bcl-2
indicating a "double hit" lymphoma characterized by a
Burkitt's-like lymphoma. He then began chemotherapy.
.
TREATMENT HISTORY:
-- Initiated treatment with Dose-adjusted [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy on

[**2197-7-29**] with two doses of Rituxan on [**2197-8-2**] and
[**2197-8-3**]. Follow up CT imaging on [**2197-8-5**] showed stable
lymphomatous lesions in the kidney, spleen, and abdominal nodes.

-- Rituxan 500 mg given on [**2197-8-10**] with a fever that evening

and admission for neutropenia. During admission, noted for
atrial fibrillation with RVR and was started on digoxin at 0.125

mg daily along with metoprolol 200 mg daily.
-- Readmitted on [**2197-8-18**] for his second cycle of [**Hospital1 **]
chemotherapy, which was delayed for two days due to hypotension

and cough. A CT of the chest showed bilateral lower lobe
opacities, right greater than left, concerning for infection and
he was treated with a course of Levaquin.
-- On [**2197-8-30**], received Rituxan at 375 mg/m2.
-- Follow up PET scan on [**2197-9-6**] showed no evidence for
lymphoma but was notable for multiple peripheral base pulmonary

opacities with rims of soft tissue density and relative central

lucencies most of which were new. He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] CT of the chest
for further evaluation, which showed multiple filling defects
within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right
lower lobe arteries compatible with pulmonary emboli.
-- Admitted on [*
