Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with Balloon Angioplasty to OM2

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58248**] is a 64yo M w/ PMH of GERD, anxiety, and spinal
stenosis who presented to OSH this AM after waking up with 8/10
chest pain. He described it as diffuse, across his chest,
radiating through to his back. Was short of breath, but did not
wake his wife for 3 hours. No diaphoresis, + nausea. At 5am,
woke his wife who brought him to OSH where he was found to have
ST depressions in V1, V2. He was given ASA, SL ntg, lopressor IV
x1, and heparin bolus + heparin gtt and then transferred to
BIMDC for cath. On admission here, he had possible ST elevations
in inferior leads and diffuse J point elevation in precordial
leads. Cardiac enzymes on admission were negative. He was given
SL ntg and ativan, started on nitro gtt, and transferred to cath
lab.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD
had
70-80% proximal stenosis. The LCX had 90% lower pole OM1
stenosis. The
RCA was small without significant stenoses.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left
sided
pressures (mean RA pressure was 18mmHg, mean PCWP was 18mmHg,
and
LVEDP was 31mmHg).  There was evidence of moderate pulmonary
hypertension (mean PAP was 30mmHg). The cardiac index was low at
1.7
L/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography revealed 2+ mitral regurgitation
without wall
motion abnromalities. Calculated ejection fraction was 50%.
4. Successful POBA of OM2 (see PTCA comments).
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock with severe diastolic and mild systolic
dysfunction.
3. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
4. Successful PTCA of OM2.
.
Imaging:
[**2160-2-11**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal third of the
inferolateral wall and the distal third of the anterior wall.
The remaining segments contract well. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction
c/w multivessel CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2160-2-11**]: Portable Chest - The heart is upper limits of normal in
size.  The lung volumes are decreased bilaterally with bilateral
elevation of the hemidiaphragms.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
osseous structures appear within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.
.
[**2160-2-12**]: CTA Chest - There is a small focal opacification within
the right upper lobe that may represent a focal atelectasis.
Atelectasis is seen at the lung bases bilaterally. A small
amount of concavity is noted in the left main stem bronchi, best
seen on sagittal views. There are no pleural effusions. Both
lungs are otherwise unremarkable. Soft tissue windows
demonstrate no appreciable lymphadenopathy. The heart and great
vessels are unremarkable.
.
A Swan-Ganz catheter is seen extending into the distal aspect of
the right pulmonary artery.  There are no filling defects.
There is no
evidence of pulmonary embolism.  The visualized aorta shows no
evidence of dilatation or dissection.
BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony
lesions.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary embolism, aortic aneurysm,
aortic
dissection.
.
[**2160-2-12**]: CT A/P - There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is
bibasilar atelectasis and tiny pleural effusions.  The liver,
gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach,
and bowel loops are unremarkable within the limits of this
noncontrast study.  There is no free air or free fluid.  No
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.
CT PELVIS:  Foley catheter and air are observed in the bladder.
There are multiple prosthetic calcifications.  Scattered sigmoid
diverticula are observed without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is a stranding and a small amount of fluid in the pelvis
along the iliac vessels.  No large retroperitoneal hematoma is
identified.  Stranding in the right groin is consistent with the
recent arterial puncture.
BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
osseous lesions.
IMPRESSION:  Small amount of stranding and fluid along the right
common iliac vessels consistent with a small amount of blood.
No large retroperitoneal hematoma is identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a 64 year old Male who presents with chest pain
with inferolateral ECG deviation on admission s/p POBA to OM2,
with small enzyme leak. The etiology of clinical presentation
not completely clear, question UA, NSTEMI, vs. myopericarditis.
