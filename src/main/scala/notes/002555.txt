History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 95455**] [**Known lastname 95456**] is a 71-year-old man with a history of
diastolic CHF, CAD, type II diabetes mellitus, and most recently
a insular glioblastoma diagnosed in [**2131-9-16**] now status post
radiotherapy and temzolomide currently being managed by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 724**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 95456**] presents from his [**Hospital1 1501**] after having
acute onset of lethargy at 06:00 p.m. this evening.  He was
monitored closely and his vital signs remained stable.  At
around 11:30 pm he was noted to have increased left sided
weakness and new left sided facial droop.  He was brought to
[**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department by EMS for further evaluation of his
altered mental status.

In the Emergency Department initial vital signs were:
Temperature 97.3 F, pulse 70, blood pressure 137/79, repsiration
16, and oxygen saturation 97% on 2 liters via nasal cannula.
Patient was found to be lethargic but arousable. CT head was
performed showing interval increase in hemorrhage around the
mass, now with acute area of hemorrhage 2.6 cm x 1.4 cm.
Neurology was consulted urgently for left sided facial droop and
weakness.  Given evidence of bleed they recommended holding home
aspirin and maintaining blood pressure control. Per ED team, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1151**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from the Neuro-Oncology Service reviewed the imaging
and did not recommend any changes to current antiepilectic and
steroid regimen at this time.  He recommended further imaging
only if significant change in neurologic examination.
Laboratory findings were notable for troponin 0.11, Hct 35
(baseline), creatinine 1.2 (baseline), INR 1.0, PTT 20.8.
Patient's EKG was unchanged compared to prior.  Chest X-ray was
without evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.  Patient
received no medications or IV fluids prior to transfer to the
Medicine ICU for serial neurologic examinations.

On arrival to the ICU the patient appears comfortable.  He
attempts to follow simple commands but is too lethargic to
follow any complex commands or to speak in full sentences.

ROS:  Difficult to obtain given lethargy.  Patient does deny any
headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain.  Per
OMR he has urinary incontinence.

sensation difficult to assess given lethargy.  Left arm appears
weaker than right.  Patient able to wiggle fingers and toes in
both hands and feet symmetrically.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2131-12-30**] Head CT:
1. Large mass in the right frontal lobe with adjacent new
hemorrhage at the right putamen.
2. Subacute infarcts in the right occipital lobe and right
posterior corona radiata.
3. No subfalcine herniation or uncal herniation.
4. No hydrocephalus.

[**2131-12-31**] Chest X-Ray:
1. No focal lung consolidation.
2. Right Port-A-Catheter with tip at the mid SVC in similar

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient with acute mental status change found to have
intraparenchymal hemorrhage at site of glioblastoma multiforme
on CT scan.  Initially admitted to the ICU, and then transferred
to the floor in stable condition.

(1) Altered Mental Status:  His head CT shows increased
hemorrhage around known glioblastoma multiforme.  It is not
clear whether his symptoms on presentation are secondary to this
hemorrhage, increased edema from his tumor, possibly a new
ischemic stroke, or the UTI.  Patient's known intracranial
lesion also raises concern for seizure activity though this is
less likely given his seizure prophylaxis and clinical history.
There was no evidence of int
