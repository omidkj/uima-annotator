History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3228**] is an 82F HTN treated with metoprolol and clonidine
and CRI (thought [**3-9**] to HTN) who presented to her her PCP today
for 3 weeks of increased leg edema. She reports that she has
always had heavy legs but developed worsening bilateral LE
swelling over the past few weeks. She denies any CP, orthopnea,
PND, or palpitations. She also denies cough, f/c, focal
infectious symptoms, wheezing. At her PCPs office, she was very
hypertensive at 240/105, again without other symptoms. Her
Creatinine was 3 (2 last fall). She was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. En
route, she developed acutely worsening SOB and tachypnea with
reportedly poor pulm exam. She again denied CP or other
symptoms. She was given supplemental oxygen. She reports her
baseline BP at home has been 160-180 systolic; she checks it a
few times per week.
.
From talking with her niece, this happened last year when she
had worsening edema and developed dyspnea. Nausea was also a
problem during that stay.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T P BP 257/140 R O2 sat. Patient was
given nitro drip and bipap with improvement in her blood
pressure and subjective improvement in her dyspnea. CXR showed
pulm edema. She was weaned to 10L by facemask. EKG was without
ischemia. She had no fevers. She has a mild HA that started with
the nitroglycerin drip as well as some mild nausea.
.
Vitals prior to transfer: 174/79 85 16 95% on bipap
.
Pertinent labs:
WBC 8.7
HCT 33
plt 305
Cr 2.8 (BL 3)
K 5.1
BNP 16,457
Trop 0.03
.
On the floor, she appears comfortable on facemask and reports
her breathing is much improved, though she is nauseated.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied

Reports:
CXR ([**7-7**]): Finding suggestive of moderate-to-severe pulmonary
edema with
moderate right and small left pleural effusions. Moderately
enlarged cardiac silhouette.
.
ECHO ([**7-8**]):The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters
are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with normal free wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal systolic function.
.
Renal Ultrasound:
1. Echogenic renal cortex bilaterally consistent with chronic
renal disease.  No hydronephrosis. Simple right renal cysts.
.
2. Extremely limited Doppler examination due to technical
factors shows no
asymmetry of the main renal artery waveforms suggesting no renal
artery
stenosis is present; however, this is a very limited study. No
further
Doppler information can be obtained.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 83 yo female with PMH of HTN and CRI
presents with progressive LE edema and acute SOB resolved with
BP control and BIPAP.
.
#. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation/HTN: On admission
patient was clinically in congestive heart failure, collaborated
by pulm edema on CXR and a BNP > 16,000 and her acute dyspnea is
suggestive up flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
hypertensive emergency. In the emergency department patient
started on Nitro gtt with improvement in blood pressure from
240/140 to 200/100. Patient transiently on BIPAP, prior to
transfer to the MICU on 10 liters oxygen by nasal cannula. In
the MICU patient was quickly weaned off nitro gtt to a labetalol
gtt prior to transitioning to home medications (Labetalol and
Clonidine). Patient was also diuresed with IV lasix. On HD#1
patient was sating appropriately on [**3-10**] liters NC with blood
pressures stable in 170s. Patient transferred to the floor where
her labetalol was eventually increased to 400mg TID for better
blood pressure control and diuresis was continued. ECHO
performed and revealed diastolic dysfunction, LVH, and elevated
pulmonary artery pressure. Preliminary renal ultrasound showed
small echogenic kidneys consistent with chronic renal disease,
there was poor evaluation of renal arteries given patient
couldn't hold breath, however arterial flow to each kidney was
present. At discharge patient will follow up with nephrology and
primary care for close monitoring of blood pressure and
diastolic heart failure. More so, patient was educated to weigh
herself daily contacting her physician if her weight increases
by >3 lbs and consume no more than 2 grams of so
