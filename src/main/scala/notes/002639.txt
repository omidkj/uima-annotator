Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from outside hospital for
evaluation and pericardiocentesis.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
female with a recent diagnosis of nonischemic cardiomyopathy
with an EF of [**10-12**]% who was in her usual state of health
until [**2135-3-29**] when she presented to an outside hospital
with chest pain.  She was ruled out for a myocardial infarct
at that time; however, developed shortness of breath and
bilateral pleural effusions, at which time she was
transferred to another outside hospital where cardiac
catheterization showed clean coronary arteries but increased
right-sided pressures.  A transthoracic echocardiogram was
performed and showed an EF of [**10-17**]% and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] CCU on a dobutamine drip for a heart transplant and
evaluation for her cardiac transplant here.  She had a PA
catheter placed and was found to have a CVP of 9, PA pressure
of 42/22, cardiac output 4.5, and index of 2.5.  She was
weaned from a dobutamine drip without any changes in her PA
catheter numbers.  She was maintained on fluid restriction,
started on digoxin and Coumadin for her low EF.

The previous admission culminated and the feeling that she
did not need a cardiac transplant at that time.  She was,
therefore, discharged to home with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

She was admitted to [**Hospital 6691**] Hospital on [**2135-5-24**] for
fevers to 103-104, chills and rigors.  She had reported 5/10
chest pain since admission to [**Hospital 6691**] Hospital.  A
transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to evaluate for
endocarditis due to her persistent fevers and revealed a very
large pericardial effusion.  Her blood pressure dropped to
84/53 and her oxygen saturations decreased to 88% on room air
and, therefore, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
pericardiocentesis.

She describes her chest pain as "pressure" which was
nonradiating and not associated with food or shortness of
breath.  It started spontaneously when she was at the outside
hospital and was worse with inspiration and unrelieved by
sublingual nitrogens.  Also, during her outside hospital
course, she was started on antibiotics; however, she did not
defervesce with her fevers in the 101-103 range.  Blood
cultures and urine cultures were performed and all found to
be negative.  A CT of the chest was performed which showed
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bilateral small pleural
effusions and a 1 by 3 cm infiltrate in the right middle lobe
which did not have an appearance of pneumonia.

She had the transthoracic echocardiogram which is as
described above which noted a 1.5 cm circumferential effusion
with some RA collapse but no RV collapse.  Her EF was
calculated at 10-15%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cardiomyopathy, nonischemic, diagnosed in [**2135-3-29**]
with an EF 10-15%.
2.  Status post CVA times two, last one occurring
approximately three years ago without any residual symptoms.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  History of alcohol abuse.
5.  Cardiac catheterization on [**2135-4-6**] at outside hospital
showing clean coronary arteries, increased right-sided
pressure with RA pressure of 18, pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure 23-29, cardiac output 2.3 and index 1.37.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Anxiety.
8.  Gout.
9.  Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2135-4-11**] at [**Hospital1 18**] showed
EF 10-15%, left ventricular hypokinesis, anterior septal
akinesis, small pericardial effusion.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to Bactrim.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  (Same as her home medications.)
1.  Paxil 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Synthroid 88 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Digoxin 125 p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 10 p.o. q.d.
6.  Toprol XL 25 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lisinopril p.o. q.d.
8.  Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Aspirin.
10. Mevacor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired secretary, lives
with her husband who is very supportive and involved in her
care.  Alcohol:  She previously drank greater than five
glasses of wine per day but has had no alcohol since [**2135-3-29**].  She denied any current or remote history of tobacco
use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of a myocardial infarct at age
57.  Maternal uncles all died of myocardial infarct.  Her
cousin had idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

IMPRESSION: This is a 59-year-old female with a history of
nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of [**10-12**]%,
hypertension, history of alcohol abuse who was transferred
from an outside hospital after being admitted for a three day
history of spiking temperatures, chills, and rigors, found to
have a large  pericardial effusion.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of pericardial effusion
and possible pericardiocentesis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  PERICARDIAL EFFUSION:  Upon transfer
from the outside hospital, the patient was taken directly to
the Cardiac Catheterization Holding Area where she was found
to be hemodynamically stable.  A transthoracic echocardiogram
was performed while in the Cardiac Catheterization Holding
Area which was found to show no echocardiographic evidence of
tamponade with anterior portions of pericardial fluid
loculated an echodense.  The remainder of the pericardial
fluid is echolucent.  The effusion was moderate in size.  Her
blood pressure was checked and she was found to have no
evidence of pulsus paradoxus.

As she was stable at that point, the decision was made not to
proceed with pericardiocentesis and monitor the patient with
medical management.

She remained hemodynamically stable for the first three days
of her hospitalization with heart rate ranging from 90s to
low 110s with occasional tachycardia in the 130s to 140s.
Her blood pressure was in the 90-110/40-60 range which was
near her baseline.  Her oxygenation remained well at 95% on
room air.  On [**2135-5-30**], hospital day number three, she was
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and had a
right heart catheterization performed which showed cardiac
output of 4.5, cardiac index 2.5, PA pressure of 44/27, and
no evidence of equalization of pressures.  The pulse w
