Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
33F w/muscular dystrophy, OSA on CPAP, Cushings s/p pituitary

.

Presented from home. Was in USOH until last night when she
developed a sore throat and then URI symptoms with cough. This
progressed to include nausea, vomitting and diarrhea. Per her
husband, she took one dose of narcotic cough syrup (likely
vicodin containing).

.

Presented to [**Doctor Last Name 1495**] Medical Center where came in with lethargy,
SOB, AF with RVR. Appeared pale, cool, dusky, RR 12, sat 68%
RA.Given Dilt f/b Dilt gtt, and autoconverted back to sinus
rhythm. CPAP initiated. CT chest with contrast reportedly
unremarkable, not sent over. Trop (X) 0.196 at OSH.  ABG 7.21 /
77 /110 on NRB. +opiates on tox screen. Did have transient
improvement of mental status and vomited with 2 mg Narcan at
OSH. . Pt denied any complaints (including fevers, CP, SOB,
palps, abd pain, N/V, HA), [**Last Name (un) **] arousable to voice, but quickly
falls back asleep. Endorsed taking cough syrup last few days,
unsure if contains codeine, o/w denied any drug use. EMS gave
supplemental O2 but not PPV.



In our ED:

arousable to voice then falls back to sleep, pupils 4 mm, moving
all extremities. Vomiting lethrgic on arrival afib co2 retention
to 75- on CPAP- ? response to narcan? maybe [**Hospital1 **] gen?

- ED thinking - possible unifying diagnosis would be opiate
overdose leading to respiratory depression leading to hypoxia
leading to NSTEMI and AFib

TTE [**2124-3-24**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
is a borderline mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
systolic gradient. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

CT head w/o [**3-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Global loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation may be
secondary to
hypoxic injury. For further evaluation, could consider an MRI if
not
contraindicated.
2. No evidence of hemorrhage.

CTA [**3-24**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

2. Scattered ground-glass and more consolidative opacities
throughout the
lungs, with a bilateral lower lobe predominance, thought to be
infectious in etiology. Prominence of bilateral hilar lymph
nodes is likely reactive.

3. Moderate bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.

4. Diffuse hepatic fat deposition.

CXR [**2124-3-27**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. The right subclavian PICC line now has its tip in the mid SVC
in
satisfactory position. The right internal jugular central line
continues to have its tip in the right atrium. A nasogastric
tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
identified. Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip
approximately 4 cm above the carina.

2. Relatively low lung volumes with crowding of
