CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Painful right foot.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 64-year-old male
with diabetes type 2, borderline hypertension, and 100 pack
year smoking history status post endovascular AAA repair in
[**2119**] at [**Hospital6 1129**], who is complaining of
right foot pain and numbness for the past week.  The patient
was transferred from [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital for further workup.
He had an arteriogram at [**Location (un) 1459**], which showed occluded
abdominal ileac endovascular stent graft.  It showed 100%
patent left external ileac artery and a left common femoral
artery which was reconstituted.  It also showed that the
right external ileac artery was patent.

PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORIES:
1. Diabetes type 2.
2. Hypertension.
3. Increased cholesterol.
4. Status post endovascular AAA repair with stent in [**2119**] at
[**Hospital6 1129**].
5. Umbilical hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Avandia 8 mg q.d.
2. Lipitor 8 mg q.d.
3. Glyburide 10 mg b.i.d.
4. Tricor 54 mg b.i.d.
5. Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.
6. Nicotine patch 21 mg q.d.
7. Glucophage 1 gram twice a day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  His social history includes 100 pack year
smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature of 98.4, blood
pressure 124/55, pulse 74, respirations 19, sating 87% on
room air, and 95% on 3 liters.  Patient's weight on admission
is 92.8 kg.  In general, the patient is an alert white male.
He has bilateral basilar crackles heard in the lung fields.
His heart sounds are distant with regular, rate, and rhythm
and normal S1, S2.  His abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.  He has no bruits or masses.  He has a full
range of motion with plantar flexion of the right foot.  The
right foot is dusky and modeled to the mid calf.  He has 2+
carotid pulses bilaterally, 2+ radial pulses bilaterally.
Dopplerable femoral pulse on the right and a 2+ femoral pulse
on the left.  He has no signals in the DP or PT arteries on
the right, and the DP and PT arteries are dopplerable on the
left.

On admission, the patient's hematocrit was 36.7.  His BUN and
creatinine were 21 and 1.5 respectively.

His EKG showed no acute ischemic changes and his chest x-ray
showed signs of COPD.

His INR on admission was 1.0.

Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital **] Hospital to the
Vascular ICU, where he was preoped for an aortobifemoral
bypass graft, which was performed on [**2129-8-6**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was transferred upon stabilization
in the PACU to the Vascular ICU.

Postoperatively, on postoperative day one, the right foot
remained cyanotic and cool to the touch.  The patient was
able to plantar flex and dorsiflex his right foot.  No
Heparin was administered to the patient at this time as the
team was awaiting for the graft to heal before starting
anticoagulation.

On postoperative day one, the patient's hematocrit increased
to 2.8 from 1.7.  His BUN was 31.  As mentioned, his right
foot remained cool, and cyanotic, and painful with no DP or
PT signals appreciated on the right.

On postoperative day one, the patient was transferred to the
Surgical ICU for management of worsening renal function and
worsening metabolic acidosis.  His creatinine further
increased later on postoperative day one to 3.5 and his BUN
to 40.  His bicarb at this time was 19.  An ABG showed that
the patient was acidotic, pH of 7.25, pCO2 of 45, pO2 of 76,
bicarb of 21, and a base deficit of 7.

The patient was started on a Heparin drip in the Surgical
ICU, and the Renal service was consulted.  The patient was
aggressively hydrated.  It was felt that his worsening renal
function was due to acute tubular necrosis, possibly due to
hypovolemia.

On postoperative day two, the patient became confused.  It
was thought that perhaps the patient was going through
alcohol withdrawal.  He was given 4 mg of Haldol b.i.d., to
control these symptoms, Ativan was also given, but the
patient had worsening confusion with response to Ativan.

On postoperative day two, the patient was intubated for
MRI/MRA of the right foot as well as placement of a Swan and
radial A-line.

A MRA of the right lower extremity was obtained at this time,
which showed proximal occlusion of the right superficial
femoral artery, which was reconstituted after the anterior
tibial artery.  The anterior tibial artery was open to the
ankle, however, the foot vessels on the right were not
visible.  The foot remained modeled and cool, although it had
capillary refill.

The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells
and was then taken to the OR for femoral distal bypass graft.
Postoperatively, the patient was taken back to the Trauma
Surgical ICU, and remained intubated and sedated.

Postoperatively from the second surgery, the right dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial arteries had Doppler signals.  At
this point, the patient's creatinine began to decrease from
30.3 to 2.8.

On postoperative days #4 and one, patient began to be weaned
from the ventilator and was extubated on postoperative day
five and two.  He had dopplerable pulses bilaterally of the
DP and PT arteries.  His creatinine on postoperative day five
and two was 2.4.

On postoperative days six and three, the patient was
transferred back to the Vascular ICU.  Throughout the rest of
the hospital course, the patient's creatinine continued to
drop and on discharge was 1.7 on [**8-16**], postoperative days 10
and 7.  Patient's mental status was felt back to baseline.

On postoperative days six and three, the patient was seen for
the first time by Physical Therapy, continued to follow the
patient throughout the rest of his hospital stay.

On postoperative days seven and four, the patient's abdominal
wound was open over about 7 cm just inferior to the
umbilicus.  This wound was packed with wet-to-dry dressings,
no pus or exudate was noted.  On postoperative days seven and
four, the patient was transferred to the floor, where he
continued to improve.

The patient was started on Coumadin on postoperative days
eight and five.  His INR on postoperative days nine and six
was 2.5.  As the patient's right foot remained in plantar
flexion, it will be setup for the patient to be fitted for an
ankle flexion orthotic at his home upon discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair with dopplerable signals on the
right, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries with
improving color of the right foot.  His balance remains below
baseline.  His mental status is back to baseline.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home with VNA for wound care, 3x weekly
INR checks, and Physical Therapy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.
2. Percocet 5/325 mg as needed for pain.
3. Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
4. Norvasc 10 mg once a day.
5. Lipitor 80 mg once a day.
6. Glyburide 10 mg twice a day.
7. Avandia 8 mg once a day.
8. Colace 100 mg twice a day.
9. Hydralazine 50 mg 4x a day.
10. Keflex 500 mg 4x a day for seven days.
11. Coumadin 5 mg one tablet once a day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Ischemic right foot.
2. Peripheral vascular disease.
3. Clotted endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm stent.
4. Status post aortobifemoral bypass graft.
5. Status post right femoral anterior tibial artery bypass
graft.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:
1. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.  The patient should call for
appointment.
2. Home visit by [**Location (un) 51992**]Orthotics for fitting of
ankle flexion orthotic on the right.  Prescription is in the
chart.
