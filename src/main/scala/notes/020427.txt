Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
speech arrest, left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
86RHF with a PMH of AF on warfarin, CHF, s/p PPM, HTN, HLD,
T2DM, recent vertebroplasty and likely recent small infarct
presents after sudden onset left sided weakness and speech
arrest and a Code stroke was called following transfer from OSH.

.
Patient had a vertebroplasty on [**4-7**] (had held warfarin for 3
days beforehand) and following day on [**4-8**] had 2 hours of left
facial droop and dysarthria where she presented to the OSH and
CT head was negative (patient has a PPM) and hence unable to
have MRI. There patient was found to have a subtherapeutic INR
and she was bridged with LMWH and restarted on warfarin to
continue enoxaparin until INR therapeutic. She was discharged
home with a dx of TIA. Patient saw PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2112-4-12**] and found
INR 2.4 and told to stop LMWH.
.
On [**2112-4-12**] patient had eaten dinnner with daughter and
daughter went downstairs and when she came up 10-15 minutes
later found her mother holding her right arm up and gesturing,
unable to speak and with dense left weakness. EMS were called
and patient was taken to [**Hospital3 **] arriving 45 mintes
after onset of her symptoms. CT there demonstrated early infarct
signs in the R MCA territory and possible thrombus in right MCA.
She was deemed not a thrombolysis candidate due to her
anticoagulation (note also recent surgery) and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Here patient was noted to be globally aphasic, unable to say any
words and could hardly make sounds, had good spontaneous
movement on the right but dense weakness on the left side with
gaze deviation to the right. CT head here demonstrated a large
right MCA distribution infarct with ? hyperdense MCA sign on
right although vessel imaging remarkably showed no vessel
occlusion. On returning from the scanner, patient had head
jerking to the left but could move right arm purposefully and
this appeared to be seizure activity and settled after 2mg IV
lorazepam given at 00:10 and she was subsequently loaded with IV
keppra 20mg/kg. She then had respiratory issues and was wheezing
with decreased conscious level and due to concerns of
respiratory decompensation and airway protection was intubated
in the ED at 01:05.
.
Patient was moving right side pre-intubation but was sedated and
latterly not moving limbs after this.

There was no evidence of clonus.
[**Last Name (un) 1842**] negative.
Plantar response was extensor on left and flexor on right then
post likely seizure was extensor bilaterally but very prominent
on the left.

CTA head and neck:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute large right middle cerebral artery territory infarct
with some degree
of edema without hemorrhagic transformation.

2. No evidence of flow limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm
more than 3mm
in arteries of head and neck. Decreased visualization of some of
the distal
branches of the right middle cerebral artery. Correlate for
embolic etiology.

CXR:
ET tube is in standard position.  The tip is 3.4 cm above the
carina.  NG tube
tip is in the stomach.  The sideport is just distal to the EG
junction and can
be advanced few cms for more standard position.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly
is accentuated by low lung volumes.  Right transvenous pacemaker
lead
terminates in standard position in the right ventricle.  Left
lower lobe
opacity has improved consistent with improving atelectasis.
There is no
evident pneumothorax.  [**Hospital1 **]-apical opacities, larger on the left
side have
increased, worrisome for aspiration.

NCHCT:
IMPRESSION:
1.  New hemorrhagic conversion of right MCA territorial
infarction, with
several foci in the right temporal and parietal lobes.
2.  Marked worsening of mass effect from cytotoxic edema causing
effacement of
the right lateral ventricle and minimal subfalcine herniation.
Assessment of
basal cisterns is limited (using the bedside instrument), but
the patient is
at risk for further central herniation.

NCHCT
IMPRESSION:
2.  Further evolution of the extensive right MCA territorial
infarction with a
greater degree of leftward subfalcine and likely early right
uncal herniation.
2.  Hemorrhagic transfor
