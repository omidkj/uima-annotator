Media

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-12-10**]
1. Mitral valve replacement with size #27-mm [**Company 1543**]
    tissue valve.
2. Tricuspid valve exploration for possible vegetation.


History of Present Illness:
29 year old female that presented to
OSH with mild nausea, chest pain, abdominal pain, headache and
generalized weakness.  Three days prior to presentation [**11-18**]
she
had left rehab AMA and left with PICC line and no antibiotics.
From [**Date range (1) 4359**] she admits to use of heroin but denied putting
anything in PICC, and was brought to the OSH emergency by
police.
She was admitted and continued to be treated for MRSA
endocarditis and now transferred for surgical evaluation

She had previously been discharged from OSH [**10-30**] to rehab for
ongoing antibiotic treatment for MRSA endocarditis with septic
emboli to her spine, lungs, spleen and was complicated by
anemia,
ATN, and skin infection
Discharged on Ceftazidime to complete [**11-5**]
and Linezolid to complete [**11-24**]

Concern for ATN - had presented with creatinine 1.13 [**11-22**] that
increased to 1.8 on [**11-26**] - of note had been receiving NSAID and
dehydrated per outside records.

[**11-26**] received blood transfusion with concern for reaction after
receiving 100 ml blood, tachycardia, chest pain and severe
itching - she was medicated with benadryl and symptoms resolved.

The next day she was premedicated, transfused with two units
with
no reaction.

She was started on MS contin with dilaudid for breakthrough to
prevent opiod withdrawal at the OSH

ID consult OSH - MRSA bacteremia with discitis, splenic infarct,
septic emboli, and mitral valve vegetation - on linezolid due to
renal failure that they felt was from vancomycin

Cardiology consult OSH - MRSA endocarditis involving mitral and
tricuspid valves

Pertinent Results:
[**2142-11-30**] UE u/s
IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive thrombus within one of the right
brachial
veins. Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 66255**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 90652**] at 9:14
p.m. on [**11-30**], [**2142**] via telephone.
.
[**12-2**]/ MR head
IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal FLAIR signal in right frontal sulci raises the
possibility of
leptomeningitis. Correlation with CSF study is recommended.
2. Multiple foci of abnormal susceptibility in bilateral frontal
and right
parietal lobes may represent hemorrhagic foci/calcifications. CT
of the head
is requested to rule out calcifications.
.
[**2142-12-3**] CT head
IMPRESSION:
1. No right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The signal
abnormality on the
prior MRI is likely related to leptomeningeal infection, given
the history of
endocarditis, or other leptomeningeal infiltration.

2. No calcifications corresponding to the abnormal
susceptibility foci in the
right frontal, left frontal, and right parietal lobes,
indicating that the
abnormal susceptibility is related to non-acute blood products.
Since the
left frontal and the right parietal foci are associated with
abnormal contrast
enhancement and subtle high signal on precontrast T1 weighted
images, these
could be secondary to subacute septic emboli.
  .
[**2142-12-6**] MR spine
IMPRESSION: Limited MRI study as patient could not continue with
the
examination. Only sagittal T2-weighted sequences through the
cervical and
thoracic spine were obtained. There is reduced intervertebral
disc height
along with signal abnormalities in the adjoining endplates at
T4-T5 as
described above, which may be degenerative. However, possibility
of
underlying infection (discitis/osteomyelitis) cannot be
excluded. A repeat
MRI study with gadolinium is requested.
.
[**2142-12-8**] CT spine
IMPRESSION: No evidence of paraspinal abscess in the thoracic or
lumbar
region. No evidence of high-grade thecal sac compression seen
and no obvious
evidence of epidural abscess seen, although CT is not as
sensitive as MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 16671**]n of intraspinal abscess. Mild irregularity of the
endplates at T3-4
level seen. Bilateral pleural effusions are identified. Defect
is seen in
the partially visualized spleen, which could be due to an
infarct. Clinical
correlation recommended. A torso CT can help for further
assessment.
.
[**2142-12-10**] prelim Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a moderate-sized
vegetation on the mitral valve. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is a mobile mass on the tricuspid valve. There is
mild-to-moderate ([**1-28**]+) tricuspid regurgitation with an
eccentric jet. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. Left ventricular function is mildly depressed (LVEF =
50%). There is mild hypokinesis of the interventricular septum.
Right ventricular function is moderately depressed. There is a
well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a mean gradient of 7 mmHg
across the prosthetic mitral valve at a blood pressure of
101/63. Moderate (2+) tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The aorta
is intact post-decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for further evaluation and pre-op
workup.  ID consulted and helped direct antibiotic course of
Daptomycin.  Psychiatry made recommendations in light of her
history of bipolar disorder.  She was started on Seroquel.  She
was started on heparin for right upper extremity non-occlusive
thrombus seen on ultrasound.  Vascular sur
