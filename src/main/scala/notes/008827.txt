Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, mental status changes,diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NA


History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 female with HTN, hyperlipidemia who was admited to
MICU with altered mental status, platelet count of 5, ARF,
hypotension after having vomiting and diarrhea over one week.

She experienced upper respiratory symptoms associated with
diarrhea over several days. She was given immodium but this did
not help her much. She was having approximately 8 episodes per
day that were non bloody. Because her mental status was altered
and she was brought to the ED and a head CT was negative for
bleed. She received ceftriaxone and vancomycin x1 dose in the
ED. Her mental status has improved since she was admitted
yesterday.

In the ED she was noted to be hypotensive and was given IVF. She
required levophed for pressure support but this has been
discontinued and she has been able to mantain normal BP with
IVF. A CXR was performed and showed diffuse patchy infiltrates
and mediastinal widening (?lymphadenopathy). A chest CT showed
diffuse GGOs with ?consolidation at the bases. A [**Name (NI) 5283**] sono was
performed and was negative for cholecystitis.  UA was positive
and she was started on levofloxacin. Her UCx grew low number of
GNR.

On presentation she was noted to have ARF with cre elevated at
4.0 She has been geting IVF and her Cre has improving to 2.6.
Her outpatient cre was ?1.5. FeNa 0.7. Initially she had AG of
22 and HCO3 of 19. After fluids AG is 16 and HCO3 is 16.

Hematology was consulted for TCP. Smear was negative for
schistos, LDH was elevated but hapto was normal. The patient
denied any fever prior to presentation. Review of outpatient
record shows that she was TCP in [**10-20**] with plt of 7. Per
daughter, the patient has been told she has "clumping
platelets". Blue tube [**Last Name (un) **] have been employed in the hospital.
Folate and B12 were negative. No evidence of bleeding since the
patient has been hospitalized and she denies any bleeding PTA.

Head CT: negative

[**Month/Day/Year 5283**] US: 1. Dilated gallbladder, but no evidence for acute
cholecystitis.
2. Right hydronephrosis

Renal US: Moderate right hydronephrosis persists. Left kidney
appears
unremarkable.

Chesst CT [**2157-3-24**]:
1. Mild pulmonary edema.
2. Collapse of bibasilar segmental bronchi, could be due to
bronchomalacia. Marked peribronchovascular thickening, could be
atelectasis alone or in infiltrative process such as sarcoid or
lymphadenopathy. Repeat chest CT is recommended after resolution
of the acute edema with perfect coaching about deep inspiration.

3. Granulomatous nodal calcification.
4. Mild aortic valvular calcification, of unknown hemodynamic
significance.
Moderate mitral annulus calcifications. Scattered coronary
artery
calcifications. Cardiomegaly.
5. Small hiatal hernia.

CXR
[**2157-3-23**]
Right IJ central venous catheter tip in the expected location of

the cavoatrial junction.

Low lung volumes limit evaluation. Left basilar atelectasis,
mild CHF.
Widened appearance of the mediastinum for which clinical
correlation is
advised.

[**2157-3-25**]
As compared to the previous examination, there is marked
improvement of the chest radiograph. The size of the cardiac
silhouette has decreased, the lung volumes have increased. The
preexisting evidence of overhydration has markedly decreased,
although the aspect of the hilar
structures still suggests minimal remnant central edema. There
also is a
marked decrease of the pre-existing predominantly left mid lung
and right
basal areas of atelectasis. There is no evidence of pleural
effusion. No
focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia. Mild
tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta, the central venous catheter is unchanged in
position.
---
[**2157-3-26**]
Comparison is made to the prior day. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours are unchanged. There are areas of minor atelectasis at
the lung bases associated with low lung volumes, but no
congestive heart failure, pleural effusion or pneumothorax

ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral va
