Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Left main stem stent obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy and left main stem stent removal

History of Present Illness:
80 yo female with COPD, tracheobonchomalacia, CAD s/p MI (12yrs
ago), seizure d/o, HTN, Type II DM s/p left mainstem stent [**10-11**]
who presented to [**Hospital 1562**] hosp [**11-24**] with SOB and respiratory
failure [**1-14**] LLL mucus plugging and L mainstem 90% occlusion.
Also had seizure with sub-therapeutic dilantin level.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for w/u of L mainstem stent obstruction.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 57475**] took patient to bronch, which revealed
granulation tissue obstruction, then entire stent removed [**11-29**].
 Since the patient did not feel better when the stent was
placed, she was not considered to be a good candidate for
tracheoplasty.  Ms.[**Known lastname 17562**] could not be extubated after stent
removal because of laryngeal edema/spasm, finally extubated
[**12-4**] with no plans for further intubation if necessary (i.e.
DNI).  Vanc (started at OSH on [**11-24**])/levo (started [**11-30**]) to
complete 10 day course for LLL opacities suspicious for PNA.
Initially started on Nipride for tight BP control, weanded off
on [**11-30**]. Started on captopril on [**12-2**] with good response to
borderline hypotension.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Stent Obstruction:  Pt presented with shortness of breath
and fever to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital [**11-24**] with SOB and LL mucus
plugging.  Bronch revealed left mainstem occlusion and pt
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for care.  Bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 18**] also
revealed nearly totally occluded L main stem stent, which was
removed.  No tracheostomy was placed since pt had no subjective
improvement when stent initially went in, late [**9-16**].  Ms.[**Known lastname 17562**]
was unable to be extubated second to lack of air-leak, and
presumed laryngeal edema/spasm.  Finally, she was extubated
[**12-4**] and tolerated the extubation well.  Currently, denies
shortness of breath, cough, sputum production or chest pain.
Interventional pulmonary no longer feels Ms.[**Known lastname 17562**] to be an
interventional candidate for her tracheobronchiomalacia.

2.  Seizure D/O:  Pt experienced a seizure at OSH, by report.
She was placed on dilantin and dosed by level.  No further
seizure activity.

3.  DMII:  Kept on insulin sliding scale and diabetic diet.  No
episodes of hyperglycemic coma or hypoglycemia.

4.  ID:  Vanc (started at OSH [**11-24**]) and levoquin (started
[**11-30**]) to complete a 10 day course of possible post-obstructive
PNA (will finish [**12-10**]).  Now without features of pneuomonia by
physical.  No septic hemodynamics.  Lactate normal.

5.  HTN:  Transiently required nipride gtt for BP control,
easily transitioned to PO ACE-inhibitor, with good control.

6.  Mental Status Change:  Pt noted to have a decreased
sensorium and behaving inappropriately.  This was attributed to
sedatives (while intubated), possible hypoxia, ICU psychosis and
sundowning.  She was at baseline by time of discharge.
