ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  The patient is an 83
year-old female with an extensive past medical history as
above who was noted at her rehab facility to be growing more
and more ill over the course of the days prior to admission
with some development of blisters around her amputation site
and also a minimal amount of erythema.  They had managed the
wounds conservatively, but then the patient was noted to have
spiked a temperature to 101.0 degrees and an elevated white
blood cell count of 15.6 as per reports along with fevers and
chills.  Therefore she was sent to the Emergency Department
for evaluation.  When she was initially seen temperature was
101.6.  She was in sinus tachycardia with a pulse of 102.
Her blood pressure was 151/69 with a respiratory rate of 20
and she was satting 94% on room air.  She appeared to be
moderately ill, but otherwise no adenopathy was noted and
there was no JVD.  The heart was irregular.  There were no
rubs.  Her abdomen was otherwise soft, nontender.  There was
no hepatosplenomegaly or hernia present.  The left below the
knee amputation site was found to be mildly erythematous
without discharge and there was evidence of a little bit of
wound dehiscence.  Otherwise in terms of her pulse
examination her femorals were 2+ palpable bilaterally with
the remaining pulses of her right for popliteal monophasic,
dorsalis pedis biphasic and posterior tibial biphasic.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count was 25.9 with a
hematocrit of 30, otherwise her BUN and creatinine were 16
and 0.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and started on
broad spectrum antibiotics for her left below the knee
amputation stump infection.  It was evident that there was a
scant amount of devitalized tissue and that she would need
operative debridement.  Therefore on [**4-28**] of [**2130**] she went
to the Operating Room at which time the left below the knee
amputation stump was opened.  There was significant evidence
of gross infection with a great degree of pus, which later
proved to be Methicillin resistant staph aureus based on
culture data.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and
was extubated in Operating Room and taken to the Post
Anesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  The remainder of
the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course is by systems:

1.  Neurological:  The patient did well and had relatively no
issues.  She occasionally had mental status changes during
episodes of hypoxia when she was in the Intensive Care Unit,
but these had resolved by the time of discharge at which time
the patient was alert and oriented to person, place and time
and had no ore episodes of confusion.

2.  Respiratory:  The patient actually had quite a number of
complications.  Initially when she was admitted the patient
had no O2 requirement, but given the different amounts of
fluids she was given during her hospitalization whether
intraoperatively or postoperatively or with feeding the
patient developed some bilateral pleural effusion, which
caused her some respiratory compromise.  This was combined
with her congestive heart failure, which will be discussed
below caused her to have persistent O2 requirement for some
time, which required a great degree of diuresis given the
fact that she may have had a degree of pulmonary edema.  Also
postoperatively after her left below the knee amputation
revision and debridement on postoperative day three and four
the patient acutely desaturated requiring 100% nonrebreather,
but not intubation with chest film showing what appeared to
be an aspiration pneumonia and after weight time the patient
did have a swallow evaluation indicating that the patient is
to be on strict aspiration precautions with only thickened
liquids, but as noted below aggressive diuresis, chest
physical therapy, use of nebulizer treatment and Mucomyst as
needed the patient's pulmonary status greatly improved along
with some broad spectrum antibiotics and by the time she was
ready for discharge, although she continued to have some
bibasilar crackles, which were consistent with some residual
effusions of what was thought to be aspiration pneumonia had
essentially cleared.  She had been afebrile and otherwise her
O2 requirement was only minimal to maintain excellent sats on
room air.  She often at times maintained sats in the mid 90s
on room air.

3.  Cardiology:  The patient experienced multiple episodes of
congestive heart failure secondary to fluid shifts with even
being given fluids as little as 250 cc causing the patient to
go into an episode of failure.  She was ruled out for
myocardial infarction during her hospitalization secondary to
an episode of chest pain and her recurrent congestive heart
failure.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  As noted the speech and swallow
service felt the patient may have had difficulty swallowing
putting her at increased risk for aspiration pneumonia.
Therefore she was initially kept NPO for sometime, but
eventually transitioned over to total parenteral nutrition
once her fluid status had improved and finally prior to
discharge underwent placement of a G tube and J tube for
enteral nutrition and decompression.  Interestingly it was
thought that the patient may have had an abdominal wall
hernia, which may have been causing her symptoms of abdominal
pain and nausea, but on expiration this was found to be a
hematoma during the procedure for placement of her G tube and
J tube.

5.  Fluids and nutrition:  The patient responded badly to
even minimal amounts of intravenous fluids as little as 250
cc with an episode of congestive heart failure when her
fluids were minimized and her diuresis was done aggressively
with Lasix.  The patient improved quite dramatically very
quickly.  Her nutrition as noted was given initially with an
oral diet, but given the fact she was not taking much and her
difficulty with eating well on an O2 face mask she was
started on total parenteral nutrition, which was slowly
weaned and switched over to Impact with fiber tube feeds
prior to discharge.  An addendum to this discharge summary
will indicate the final regimen she was sent home on.

6.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine did bump to as high as
1.0, but this was stable and otherwise the patient made a
moderate amount of urine without the addition of diuretics.

7.  Hematology:  The patient did have a minimal amount of
blood loss during her left below the knee amputation revision
and also during her evacuation of hematoma and G and J tube
placements, but it was felt worthwhile that the patient's
hematocrit should be kept above 30 given her cardiac history
and therefore she was transfused as needed to keep her
hematocrit above 30.  Otherwise her platelet counts had been
stable.  There was no evidence of any sort of HIT.

8.  Infectious disease:  As noted the patient grew MRSA from
her wound at the left below the knee amputation site for
which she was treated with intravenou
