Studies
.
CXR PA and LAT ([**2204-10-9**])
In comparison with study of [**10-8**], there is continued enlargement
of
the cardiac silhouette without evidence of elevated pulmonary
venous pressure
in a patient with previous CABG procedure and elevated right
hemidiaphragm.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis ([**2204-9-26**])
CT ABDOMEN: A few patchy airspace opacities in the lung bases
are nonspecific
but could represent early infection. A punctate granuloma is
present in the
left base. There is no pleural effusion. The heart is top normal
in size
without pericardial effusion. Relative myocardial [**Name2 (NI) 13215**]
to the blood
pool is compatible with severe anemia. Punctate calcification in
the cardiac
apex is likely related to known LV thrombosis. A linear
calcification
paralleling the left lateral ventricular wall may represent
calcification in
papillary muscles. There is moderate-to-severe multivessel
coronary arterial
calcification as well as aortic valve calcification.
Postoperative changes of
CABG are demonstrated.

There is a small amount of perihepatic ascites. There is a long
segment of
sigmoid colon with significant mural thickening and likely
intramural
hemorrhage associated with increased density and stranding in
the mesocolon
extending into the anterior pararenal space and lateral conal
fascial. There
is an unusual appearance of blood in the sigmoid colon and
rectum with a
hematocrit level in the rectum and a convex superior edge. While
this looks in
many places to be intraluminal, it could be mural. There is
additional
stranding in the mesorectal fat posterior to the rectum w
