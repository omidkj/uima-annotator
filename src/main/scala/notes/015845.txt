Brief Hospital Course:
This 76-year old white female with multiple medical problems, as
above, had seizure-like activity on the day of admit,
transferred by EMS to [**Hospital 5871**] hospital, found to be hypotensive
(60/30), prompting pressor support, stabilized, and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up. On presentation, pt noted to be
febrile (101)with
continued hypotension (80's) and increasing heart rate (110). A
code was called and pt started on fluid bolus, levophed, and
Zosyn.  Patient had concurrent non-st-elevation MI; original
echo showed EF of 50-55%, along with a CTA, which was negative
for dissection.
1. Infectious disease: Patient was initially treated as per code
sepsis protocal with fluid boluses and antibiotics.  Patient was
found to have lower lobe pneumonia found on CT scan.  Initially,
patient was treated with zosyn, then switched to PO bactrim due
to penicillin allergy, then switched to levofloxacin, despite
lowering seizure threshold upon transfer to the floor.
Patient's sepsis-like picture resolved within 2 days, cultures
remained negative or no growth to date until the day of
discharge.  On the day of discharge, patient remained afebrile
with a plan to complete levofloxacin for a 2-week course, to be
completed on [**3-12**].
2. Cardiology:
- NSTEMI:  In the setting of hypotension and EKG changes with a
troponin and CK-MB bump, patient treated for an active MI/NSTEMI
while in unit.  Patient was initiated on a heparin gtt, aspirin,
statin, and plavix.  The heparin was continued for 44 hours.
Patient was continued on the asa, statin, and plavix
indefinitely, course length to be determined by outpatient
cardiologist/PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] team spoke with PCP about cardiology
appt as outpt, who will discuss with patient about which
cardiologist she wants to see.
   Patient was initially tachycardic in the sepsis-like setting,
for which beta blockade was initiated 2 days after acute event.
Patient was discharged on a new medication of atenolol 25mg qd.
Patient's hypertensive regimen was initially held due to the
hypotension, but was slowly titrated up until the day of
discharge.  The patient was discharged on 10mg of lisinopril,
instead of her standing dose of 20mg, since her systolics would
not support this dose.  Her norvasc was held and does not appear
on her discharge medication list.  These issues need to be
addressed as an outpatient.
   Cardiology followed patient while she was an inpatient.  It
is pertinent (and this was relayed to the primary care physician
by the primary team) that the patient needs an outpatient
exercise-MIBI and possibly an echo to further investiage her
coronary artery disease.
- pump: After fluid administration, patient showed signs of
fluid overload, and diuresis was initiated on [**2-27**] and continued
through to her day of discharge.  She was initally treated wtih
40mg qd for 4 days, and then for 20mg for two days.  She was
discharged on a standing dose of 20mg of lasix due to her
compromised pump function and fluid overload on exam.  These
medication and her Cr and K+ need to be addressed wtihin three
days of discharge.
3. Pulmonary - Patient was initailly hypoxic, thought to be
multifactorial from the pneumonia, COPD, and her volume
overload.  She initially had crackles at the R base and mild
wheezes in superior fields, both of which resolved by the time
of discharge.  She was continued on nebulizer of ipratropium,
albuterol, and advair.  Upon discharge, patient was reinitated
on her spiriva.  Patient was discharged on room air, with decent
ambulatory saturations.
4. Neuro:  Patient had inciting event of seizure-like activity
prior to admit.  Her dilantin level was initially 4, loaded with
dilantin with good response to goal at >15.  Her level
subsequently dropped to 8 three days prior to discharge, for
which she was reloaded and her standing dose was increased to
450mg qd.  Her level on the day of discharge was 14.6  She needs
to have a repeat level within 3 days of discharge.  Patient was
continued on her zonisamide, her at-home sz med.  Patient needs
to see her outpt neurologist to address these issues and the
intemrittently low dilantin levels.
5. DM - Patient was treated with an insulin sliding scale and,
four days prior to discharge, also with her at-home Actos dose.
Her glucoses remained below 150.
6. Hypothyroidism  - patient was continued on her levoxyl.
7. Neuro/CVA  - by patient report, was on aggrenox as an
outpatient.  She was discharged on aspirin/plavix.  Her outside
neurologist needs to address proper stroke prevention medication
management.
8. PPx - patient was treated with sc heparin, a PPI, and
intermittent pneumoboots.
9. Code status: DNI confirmed, must discuss with pateint about
DNR
Discharged to home in stable condition.
