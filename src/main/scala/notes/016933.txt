Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for GI bleed

Upper Endoscopy and cautery of the bleeding lesion
s/p stenting of R arm arterio-venous fistula by interventional
radiology
-Upper Endoscopy with Biopsy and Pathology at OSH: no diagnostic
abnormalities


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 70 y/o male with CAD, CHF, PVD, COPD, ESRD, metastatic
melenoma who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after being
admitted there a week prior with a GI bleed. The night before he
presented to [**Hospital1 **] (one week prior to transfer) he was in his
usual state of health when he began to develop abdominal pain
and nausea, with subsequent melena and eventual coffee ground
emesis. He went to [**Hospital1 **] where he was admitted to the ICU and
recieved 2-3 units of packed red cells daily. He [**Hospital1 1834**] EGD
twice, the first time limited by active bleeding and the second
revealing a hiatal hernia, duodenitis, and an ulcerated duodenal
lesion in the third part of the duodenum. As it was felt he may
need surgical intervention, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation and management.
At admission, he complained of mild lightheadedness and chest
pain. He stated his last BM had been two days prior and without
[**Hospital1 **]. He was afebrile with a bp of 82/36 and a hr of 76,
satting 100% on 2Lnc. He was bolused one liter of IVF, resulting
in a bp of 92/44 and a resolution of his symptoms. An initial
hct was 27.2, not significantly different than his hct prior
transfer.

-------------------
Shoulder X-ray for R shoulder Pain: Right shoulder 3 views on
[**2170-8-13**]; the superior aspect of the glenoid demonstrates
subchondral lucencies. The glenohumeral joint space is within
normal limits. No dislocation or fracture. A subclavian stent is
noted. There is a central venous catheter, incompletely imaged.

IMPRESSION: Possible subchondral lucency of the superior aspect
of the bony glenoid may be seen with degenerative changes. MRI
or CT is recommended for additional evaluation.

A-V fistulogram

CONCLUSION:

1. Balloon angioplasty of the terminal, central portion of the
right cephalic vein stenosis, using 6 mm, 8 mm and eventually 8
mm cutting balloons. Moderate angiographic improvement was
noted, as well as reduction of mean pressure gradient from 20 to
10 mm Hg across this stenotic area.

2. Balloon angioplasty to 10 and 12 mm of the stenosis in the
central portion of the right subclavian vein and the right
innominate vein stent, with unsatisfactory angiographic and
hemodynamic result. Successful deployment of a 14 x 60 mm Smart
stent across that stenotic area, balloon-dilated to 12 mm, with
moderate angiographic improvement in luminal narrowing and
partial reduction in the degree of collateral venous
opacification. The trans-stenotic mean pressure gradient remains
unchanged (approximately 15 mm Hg).
--------------------
EGD: [**2170-8-8**] Duodenitis of the bulb. Active bleeding site in the
proximal descending duodenum, possibly from an erosion or a
Dielafoye's lesion. Successful cautery and injection.
Erythema and erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis
Erosions at the GE junction.
Otherwise normal egd to fourth part of the duodenum
Recommendations: continue IV Protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
If rebleeds, would get angiogram by IR to attempt embolization
and surgery consult.
Continue serial hct and transfuse as needed.
Echo [**2170-8-9**]: The left atrium is elongated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
70 y/o male with cad, chf, esrd, metastatic melanoma, s/p
radical neck exploration and LN resection transferred from OSH
with GI bleed, s/p
.
#GI bleed -- Ulcerated duodenal lesion seen on OSH EGD. Story
consistent with UGI bleed. Does not appear to be actively
bleeding. He denies NSAID use. Biopsies from OSH are pending.
Concerns include duodenitis in setting of ASA/clopidogrel use,
H. pylori, metastatic lesion.
In the ICU the pt [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] an EGD that demonstrated a small
bleeding area in the duodenum that was cauterized with good
effect and was felt to be the main source of bleeding.  His
hematocrit remained stable subsequently and he was called out to
the floor.

.
#Hypotension -- Likely [**1-31**] to hypovolemia and [**Month/Day (2) **] loss,
responded to bolus. Other possibilities include sepsis (though
does not fit SIRS criteria), cardiogenic (no ECG changes), and
adrenal insufficiency. Exercising caution given CHF and ESRD.
Hypotension was resolved on discharge
.
#RUE edema -- The first step in work-up was an ultrasound
showing no DVT but a possibility of stenosis involving his
AV-fistula.  This was examined with a fistulogram, showing areas
of stenosis at the cephalic vein and more proximally near the
stent he had placed (brachiocephalic vein).  As his CVP was 17,
IR was concerned that opening these lesions could lead to
excessive venous return and CHF, so an echo was obtained.
.
#Anemia -- Pt has some baseline anemia, likely from chronic
disease but also now has acute [**Month/Day (2) **] loss anemia. Follow
frequent hct's and txf for hct < 28, given CAD, PVD, COPD.
.
#CAD -- No evidence of active ischemia, holding asa,
clopidogrel, and metoprolol in setting of GI bleed/hypotension.
