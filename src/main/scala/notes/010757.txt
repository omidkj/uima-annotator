CXR:
UPRIGHT AP CHEST: The patient is post-median sternotomy. The
heart is
probably enlarged. The aorta is tortuous. There is a double
contour in the region of the right atrium, which may reflect
left atrial enlargement. No definite consolidation is present.
No evidence of CHF. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
detected. The osseous structures are unremarkable.  IMPRESSION:
No definite consolidation or CHF.
LATERAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: The patient is post median
sternotomy. There are no definite consolidations seen on the
lateral view. No pleural effusions.  When viewed in conjunction
with the prior AP radiograph, there is prominence of the right
hilum. This may represent early congestion. There is no evidence
of overt failure, however. Degenerative changes of the spine are
noted.
.
EKG:  Sinus rhythm, inferior Q waves consistent with prior
inferior infarction. Right bundle branch block (old).  T wave
inversion V1-4. ? old.
.
STRESS TEST [**2188**]:
EKG stress: exercised for 6 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol and
asked the test be stopped for fatigue. No arm, neck, back or
chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the
study. The ST segments are uninterpretable for ischemia in the
setting of the baseline inverted T waves. The rhythm was sinus
with several isolated vpbs. Appropriate sytolic BP response to
exercise. IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or interpretable
EKG changes. Nuclear report sent separately.

MIBI images: Neither resting nor stress images reveal any
myocardial wall perfusion abnormalities. Ejection fraction
calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after exercise
shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 67%.
Regional wall motion appears grossly normal. IMPRESSION: No
evidence of myocardial wall perfusion abnormalities at the level
of exercise achieved.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea : Etiology initially unclear, but he reported chronic
dyspnea that acutely worsened. He ruled out for MI by enzymes
and EKG-- (trop leak but has ARF on CRI; CKs flat). Had a
persantine mibi which showed normal EF and perfusion, no
symptoms. A chest xray was w/o infiltrate or effusion. Echo was
performed which showed EF 70% and essentially normal study w/o
wall motion abnormalities or valvular regurgitaton/stenosis.
Despite these normal studies, patient continued to have dyspnea
at rest, often with resp rates in the 40's, but with normal
oxgyen saturations. He was extremely anxious, agitated at times,
often not allowing his housestaff examine him and speak with
him. He was a very difficult historian. A chest CT was performed
to further evaluate the lung parenchyma which showed bilateral
peripheral ground glass opacities in the absence of pleural
effusions or septal thickening. Given the elevated white blood
cell count and clinical picture, a multifocal pneumonia was
thought most likely. He was treated with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin, but he refused these treatments for approximately
24 hours. He was extremely anxious that we were trying to hurt
him and that we didn't understand what was wrong with him. He
would repeatedly say "nothing is wrong with me." After multiple
conversations with the Russian interpreter and a psychiatry
consultation, patient agreed to receive his antibiotics.  He
clinically improved over the first few days, but then acutely
decompensated with an episode hypotension and tachypnea
overnight. He was transferred to the ICU. Heparin drip was
started for fear of MI and/or PE and was aggressively hydrated
with good BP response. He ruled out for MI and a V/Q scan was
attempted but patient didn't tolerate/complete the study. A CTA
was not possible, given his renal insufficiency. Antibtics were
contined as well and he was transferred back to the floor after
an approximately 48 hour ICU course.

Upon arrival to the floor, patient continued to have episodes of
tachypnea and was placed on a non-rebreather. He had normal
oxygen saturations during that time. ABG 7.39/29/223 on NRB. He
would not allow his resident physician to examine him, thus an
emergent psychiatry consultation was obtained. He continued to
refuse to be seen by his resident physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] multiple
efforts. He believed his resident was the daughter of people who
hated him and, in turn, he hated her. It was decided he would be
transferred to another medical service. Despite this, the
patient had symptomatic relief with some ativan and morphine,
breathing slowed, and he appeared improved. It was thought this
tachypnea was secondary to a multifocal pneumonia (rather than a
PE), as well as severe agitation and hyperventilation. His
heparin was stopped at this time and he continued to improve
over the next few days until his acute decompensation on the
evening of his death.  Autopsy revealed multiple pulmonary
emboli.
