History of Present Illness:
76 y/o M with metastatic NSCLC with brain metastasis s/p
resection and WBRT who has received no systemic therapy due to
poor performance status who presented with complaints of
increased SOB.  The patient is a poor historian due to
difficulty with memory, but per nursing home report his symptoms
started one day prior to admission.  He complained of increased
cough, SOB, at least one episode of small amount of hemoptysis
and chest pain, and per ER note subjectove fevers.  Pt was
transferred to the ER at [**Hospital1 18**] where he was found to have a new
oxygen requirement.  CT of the chest was negative for PE but did
show progression of disease with increased LUL perihilar mass,
satellite lesions, endobronchial involvement of LUL and LLL
small pleural effusion.  The patient received Cefepime, Vanco
and Levofloxacin in the ER due to concern for pneumonia.
Currently, he reports cough, no fevers, chills, no SOB (on
Oxygen).
ROS was positive for pain when urinating, but other systems were
negative as below.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
[**2138-10-6**] in the setting of acute confusion, the patient
presents, found to have a large left frontal cystic lesion,
associated edema, given Decadron and transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
[**2138-10-7**] CT torso revealed a 4 x 4 x 3.5 cm left perihilar
mass with associated lymphadenopathy in the left hilum and
mediastinum with a large left hilar lymph node measuring 2.2 cm,
suspicious pretracheal lymph nodes, left hilar and satellite
lesions, renal calculus.
[**2138-10-7**] MRI head revealed peripherally enhancing mass 3.9 x
2.8 x 3.4 cm with edema, left cerebellar 8 x 10 x 8 peripherally
enhancing lesion, also 7-mm focus in the medial temporal lobe
and small right caudate lesion.
[**2138-10-10**] left-sided craniotomy of large left-sided high
parietal lesion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Pathology revealed metastatic
carcinoma consistent with lung primary. EGFR pending, ALK
rearrangement negative, KRAS wildtype.
Postoperative MRI consistent with surgical site changes.
[**2138-10-31**] to [**2138-11-11**] WBRT with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 3929**] 20 Gy.
[**2138-12-8**], bone scan negative for metastatic disease.  Brain
MRI reveals reduction in size of left cerebellar metastatic
lesion and likely the right caudate, may be related to
treatment, although his neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] was concerned
for a small lesion in the right frontal lobe.


Social History:
He is a right handed Creole man. His family reports that he was
a marine and worked in metal welding. He has a long history of
Tobacco use 1ppd but now smoke about 10 cigarettes daily.
He has a son here in [**Name (NI) 86**] in [**Name (NI) 1468**] with three children.  He

[**2138-12-20**] pCXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-17**] and
8:
Pulmonary edema seen best in the right lung has progressed to
moderately severe. There is some reexpansion in the apex of the
previously entirely collapsed left lung. Large left hilar mass
and moderate left pleural effusion have increased since [**12-16**]. Distention of the azygos vein could be due to biventricular
heart failure, but possibility of new concurrent pericardial
effusion should be kept in mind. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2138-12-18**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant change. Subtotal opacification of the left
hemithorax. On the right, pre-existing areas of mild opacities
are minimally progressive. The right aspect of the heart border
is unchanged.
.
[**2138-12-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: Progression of left lung white-out
likely total lung collapse, underlying known lung and hilar
pathology is obscured
.
[**2138-12-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Increased size of left upper
lobe/perihilar mass compatible with known malignancy.
Moderate-sized left pleural effusion with left basilar opacity
likely reflecting atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular
congestion.
.
[**2138-12-16**] Head CT w/o contrast: IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes,
stable in appearance, without acute intracranial abnormality.
Known left cerebellar metastasis is not clearly visualized,
though the right inferior frontal lobe metastasis appears
unchanged. No new mass lesions are seen, though MRI is more
sensitive for the evaluation of intracranial metastatic disease.

.
[**2138-12-16**] CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism.
2. Significant interval progression of a left upper lobe hilar
mass with new bronchial obstruction and likely endobronchial
involvement with post obstructive left lower lobe collapse
and/or infection. New small left effusion. Increased extent of
satellite metastases within bilateral lungs and mediastinal
adenopathy.
3. Background emphysema.
4. New sclerotic lesion in T9 vertebral body, concerning for
metastasis. Unchanged left T5 laminar sclerotic lesion.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o male (Haitan creole only speaking) nursing home patient
oriented only to his name at baseline admitted with hypoxemia
and hemoptysis due to progression of his primary NSCLC with
concomittant progression of brain metastases. His initial brain
metastatsis was treated with neurosurgical resection in
