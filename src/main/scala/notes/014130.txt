Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for ongoing management of respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
central venous line placement
foley catheter
arterial line
tracheostomy
bronchoscopy
percutaneous gastric tube placement


History of Present Illness:
MR. [**Known lastname **] is a 58-year-old man with history of congenital heart
disease repairs in [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements
of the pulmonic and mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses,
closure of VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid
valve, with CHF, DM, chronic afib on coumadin and multiple GIB,
on home O2 transferred from OSH for continued management of
heart failure.
.
Outside hospital course: Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **]hospital on [**10-6**] c/o SOB, dry cough, and chest pressure. He was
found in resp distress, hypoxic,  required Bipap initially and
was found to have pH 7.23 PCO2 130 and PO2 134 and was
subsequently intubated on hospital day 2. He was thought to be
in CHF. BNP was 1680. Per report, he was started on lasix gtt
and diuresed 5-7L in first 3 days of admission. He was thought
to be overdiuresed with contraction alkalosis and bicarb peak of
62 and lasix was held.  Dopamine and levophed for pressure
support. He was also noted to have clots coming from ET tube
thought to result in transient atectasis of his left upper lung.
Anticoagulation was held. He had a drop in platelets as low as
94 but recovered to 142 prior to baseline. Hct remained stable
~33. LFTs were WNL and cardiac enzymes were flat. INR was 3.8.
.
Echo was perfromed on OSH admission showed markedly elevated
right sided pressures due to increased gradient throught the
pulmonic and mitral valve and the presence of severe TR and
possible VSD. PA pressures were calculated to close to 80mmHg.
Bioprothetic MV looked well seated and no MR. Could not
visualized PV but thought to exhibit increased transvalvular
gradient to a moderately severe degree.
.
Vital signs prior to transfer: T 100.3 103 116/38 91% vent on AC
TV 300 FiOs 40% RR 14 Peep 5.
.
Review of systems could not be obtained [**1-5**] patient intubated
and sedated.

TTE [**10-14**]:
The left and right atria are markedly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is a 1cm mid-muscular ventricular septal
defect (VSD) with bidirectional flow. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients. No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] A tricuspid valve annuloplasty
ring is present with normal gradient. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. A well-seated pulmonic valve
prosthesis is present. The gradient is high normal. No pulmonary
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Muscular ventricular septal defect with
bidirectional flow. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
free wall hypokinesis. Severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Slightly increased pulmonic bioprosthetic gradient. Normal
functioning mitral bioprosthesis.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2198**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
58-year-old man with history of congenital heart disease and
repairs in [**2160**], [**2185**] and [**2199**], status post replacements of the
pulmonic and mitral valves with mosaic bioprostheses, closure of
VSD and PFO, and surgical repair of the tricuspid valve, with
CHF, DM, chronic afib on coumadin and multiple GIB, on home O2
transferred from OSH for continued management of heart failure,
respiratory failure.
.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient uses home O2 for
presumed pulmonary hypertension, it is believed that this low
reserve set him up for acute hypercarbic respiratory failure [**1-5**]
MRSA PNA (via + sputum cultures.)  His hypoxia improved with
endotracheal ventilation.  Bronchoscopy revealed purulent
discharge consistent with pneumon
