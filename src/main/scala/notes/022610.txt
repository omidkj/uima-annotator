Brief Hospital Course:
79yoW with CML treated with Gleevec x1 year, presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
with diarrhea and repeated mechanical falls, thought to be side
effects of the Gleevec.  Pt found to be guiaic positive and
underwent colonoscopy which showed diverticulosis, and EGD which
showed stomach erythema.  Stool tests shown to be C. difficile
positive.  During her hospitalization she had a small CVA, right
frontal-parietal region, and was also shown to have previous
cerebellar stroke by MR.  This was thought to be due to Atrial
fibrillation, although the patient was thrombocytotic secondary
to her CML.  She was initially treated with a heparin gtt, with
plans to restart coumadin; however, she became coagulopathic and
developed mucosal bleeding.  Heparin was discontinued and
coumadin never started due to continued epistaxis.  The patient
became acutely hypotensive and hypoxic and was transferred to
the ICU for further care.  CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema.
Thought to be side effect of Gleevec, the Gleevec was held and
the patient continued on Hydrea.  Hydrea was initially increased
to [**Hospital1 **] dosing, but as her platelet count dropped acutely
(700s-200s in 3 days) it was subsequently held, with plans to
restart after platelets greater than 400.  It was not restarted.
 Echocardiogram showed no evidence of heart failure with EF 70%.
 Pt was placed on levophed for blood pressure support, and
oxygenation maintained by 100% NRB.  The patient remained in the
ICU for a week, unable to wean off levophed, unable to tolerate
even small boluses of 250cc IVFs without becoming acutely SOB,
using accessory muscles to breath, hypoxic and requiring BiPap.
She was also treated with 8 days Vancomycin/Zosyn for a presumed
aspiration pneumonia.  She continually refused intubation.  She
also refused po nutrition and placement of an NGT for feeding
purposes.  The patient continually expressed wishes to
discontinue care that were not supported by her family.  Social
work and chaplain were consulted.  Two days prior to her death,
a family meeting was held and the decision was made to make the
patient DNR/DNI with the understanding that no progress was made
in treating her ARDS over the week in the ICU.  Gleevec had been
held, antibiotics used, and she remained on high supplemental
oxygen and levophed support.  On the day prior to her death, she
was made CMO.  Care was continued but the patient could refuse
any further efforts at treatment.  She expired [**2124-1-22**].
