Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
Left adnexal mass

adhesions,
dissection of intraperitoneal cyst, left salpingo-oophorectomy.

Intubation
extubation
PICC line placement and removal.

History of Present Illness:
70 year old woman referred to gyn oncology by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22552**]
secondary to a
recent discovery of a left adnexal mass. The patient had
complained of persistent lower abdominal pain, and CT of the
abdomen was done at [**Hospital3 4107**] which revealed mild ascites
and a 5 cm left adnexal cyst.  There was a calcification noted
on the margin of the cyst.  Of note, the patient is s/p left
oophorectomy.  She also underwent an MRI of the pelvis, which
suggested that the 5-cm cystic mass may be arising from the
uterine fundus, possibly representing a cystic degenerating
exophytic leiomyoma.  The ascites was also noted.  She had a few
lab abnormalities that were concerning for malignancy: namely a
CA 125 up to 106, anemia with a hematocrit of 30, and
thrombocytosis with a platelet count in the 800,000 range.
After discussing her options with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**], the decision was
made to proceed with surgical intervention for difinitive
diagnosis of this mass. The plan was made for a laparoscopic
approach, although conversion to laparotomy was felt to be a
high risk given her previous surgeries.

Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has hypertension.  Early in [**2169**], she
had a persistent common bile duct stone that caused right upper
quadrant discomfort and it was removed via ERCP.  She had a
recent colonoscopy which was normal.  She is up to date with her
mammograms, the last one being in 04/[**2168**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  15 years ago, she had a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy.  10 years ago, she had an open right
oophorectomy.  3 years ago, she had an appendectomy with return
to the OR 3 days later for lysis of adhesions.  2 years ago, she
had a diagnostic hysteroscopy for post-menopausal bleeding which
revealed only atrophy.  She has had breast surgery in the past.

OB/GYN HISTORY:  She is gravida 3, para 3.  She has no history
of
fibroids, pelvic infections or abnormal Pap smears.  The last
Pap
smear was in [**1-/2169**] and is reportedly normal.

Social History:
She is retired.  She is married.  She denies tobacco, drug or
alcohol use.


Family History:
She denies family history of cancer.

Physical Exam:
At admission -
HEENT:  Negative.
NECK:  Supple, no masses.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.
RESPIRATIONS:  Bilaterally clear.
BACK:  No spinal or CVA tenderness.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, well-healed incisions are noted all
over the abdomen.  There is no evidence of herniation with
Valsalva.
GROIN:  No enlarged lymph nodes.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3, cranial nerves II through
XII grossly intact.
PELVIC:  Normal external genitalia.  Vagina reveals no masses or
lesions.  Cervix reveals no mass or lesion.  There is no
cervical motion tenderness.  Uterus is normal in size and
consistency, and there is no palpable adnexal mass today.  There
is no rectal mass on exam.

Pertinent Results:
.
CT Chest and abdomen, [**5-18**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. Small foci of airspace opacity in the lingula and right
middle lobe, which are concerning for infection.
4. Interval increase in ascites, which continues to measure as
simple fluid density. No evidence of acute blood products within
the abdomen.
5. Inflammatory stranding, and intraperitoneal air in the mid
abdomen, with no discrete abscess. This intraperitoneal air is
likely due to postoperative status, though in this patient with
known enterostomy, extravasated air from the bowel cannot be
excluded.
6. Extremely thinned fascia in the mid abdomen with pockets of
air on both sides in both the subcutaneous tissue and
intraperitoneally. No definite evidence of dehiscence.
7. Enhancement of the peritoneal lining associated with the
ascites is a nonspecific finding, but can be seen in
intra-abdominal infection.
.
TTE: [**5-18**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
severe global  left ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis with
relative sparing of the apex. The  basal to mid septum is
akinetic. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. RV
systolic function is borderline preserved. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear  structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation.  The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.  There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a  trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
[**5-24**] CT ABD
1. Increased intraperitoneal fluid compared to a few days prior
with successful placement of 2 pigtail catheters, one right
sided and one left sided, without complication.
2. Thrombosis within left gonadal vein
3. 30-mm left omental soft tissue density may represent a focus
of heaped omentum in the setting of copious ascites, though
malignant omental caking cannot be completely excluded.
4. Decreased free intra-abdominal air with a few small foci
persisting. Persistent subcutaneous emphysema without definite
location of the site of patient's enterocutaneous fistula.
5. 29 x 24 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with mural
thrombus.
6. 8-mm low attenuation of spleen inferiorly, not fully
characterized. The differential is broad and includes benign
entities such as hemangioma but can also include infectious and
malignant entities. Evaluation by ultrasound is recommended when
clinically indicated.
7. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
8. Persistent large pleural effusions.
