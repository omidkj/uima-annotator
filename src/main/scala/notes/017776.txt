Mr [**Known lastname 976**] is a 57-year-old gentleman with a CML s/p allogeneic
BMT in [**9-/2121**], course c/b chronic GVHD (affecting skin and
liver), who presented to the [**Hospital 3242**] clinic for routine follow up
when he was noted to be very SOB. His O2 sats were in low 80%
range; his other VS were normal and he was afebrile. He stated
that his symptoms began 2 days ago when he noticed some
congestion and a cough productive of green sputum.  He states
that his SOB was markedly worse today upon waking up.  He was
also complaining of nausea and a headache.  He vomited x1 and

this week.  The patient was put on 5L NC and his sats increased
to 94%.  On exam in the clinic, his lungs with diffuse coarse
crackles. He was sent to the ED.  Of note, the patient has been
on Coumadin for recent PE and continued immunosuppression for
GVHD.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY
# CML diagnosed in 1/[**2120**]. During the [**2120-8-17**] the
patient first noticed some lower extremity swelling and began to
feel quite fatigued. However he did not have insurance at the
time and did not go to his physician for evaluation. In [**Month (only) 404**]
[**2120**] he presented to [**Hospital6 204**] with an acute onset
of dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and confusion. Workup was
consistent with pneumonia and anemia with a hematocrit of 23. He
had an elevated white count, elevated platelet count, increased
basophils, and splenomegaly at that time. Further workup and
bone marrow biopsy were consistent with CML. His peripheral
blood was [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome positive. He was started on
Hydrea, allopurinol, and Gleevec. He initially required a
Gleevec dose of 800 mg daily but his disease was never fully
controlled on this medication. He has been noted several times
since [**2121-1-15**] to have a platelet count of 700,000- 1,000,000.

.
In [**2121-6-17**], his Gleevec was stopped and he was started on
Sprycel 70 mg twice a day with improved platelet response. His
Hydrea was also tapered and stopped at this time. He is now s/p
myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant for CML refractory
to bcr/abl targeted therapies. He tolerated this as above with
diarrhea, rash on upper torso, and abdominal pain. His diarrhea
is now well controlled with qmonthly photopheresis.
