History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60749**] is a 22 yr old male who was transferred from [**Hospital3 25354**] on [**5-29**] for further management of seizure,
altered mental status, and fever. Pt was in his usual state of
health until 3 1/2 weeks prior to admission when he developed a
viral syndrome including rhinorrhea, body aches, warmth, night
sweats which lasted for 2 weeks. This happened approx a week
after he returned from spring break in [**State **]. He was fine for
a week after the illness. On [**5-26**] he developed olfactory
hallunications and seized. Was taken to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 189**] [**Hospital1 **]. CT scan at
the time was reportedly negative, and he was given an outpatient
Neuro appt. On [**5-29**] he again had an episode of generalized
seizure and was taken back to the LGH where a CT head was neg
for any acute bleed. An LP was done that showed 679 WBC with
lymph predominance, TP of 51 and Glucose of 81. Was given a dose
of Ceftriaxone/vanc/Acyclovir and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On [**5-29**]
he had a Tmax of 102 where he was started on Ceftriaxone/Vanc
for possible bacterial meningitis, Acyclovir for aseptic
meningitis, and Bactrim to cover for listeria. He was also
started on methylprednisone as CT showed edema and was admitted
to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Past Medical History:
1.)Asthma
2.)H/O EBV infection

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60749**] lives with his girlfriend and her parents. He works
at a desk job for an insurance company. Occasional ETOH. No
tobacco. No drugs.

Family History:
--father HTN
--mother arthritis
--grandparents - MI, DM, CHF, lung CA, prostate CA all died at
age 70s
--brother had generalized seizure in [**2139-5-14**]

NEURO: 5/5 strength upper/lower equal bilaterally; 2+ reflexes
biceps/patellar equal bilaterally; sensation to pain and light
touch intact throughout; CN 2-12 intact; toes downgoing
MENTAL STATUS: aphasia (receptive and expressive), anomia,
apraxia. For example, Pt has halting speech without much
intonation and has difficulty producing spontaneous speech,
naming, and repeating. He also has episodes where he speaks in
jibberish and has difficulty finding words. When asked to write
"I love chocholate" he wrote "I tool like", and when asked to
write "My name is [**Name (NI) **]" he wrote "My name closet" He was unable
to subtract 7s from 100, first saying "7, 6, 5, . . ." then when
asked again, saying "100, 99, 98, 97" When asked to read my name
tag he would say some words that were on the tag then say words
that were not on the tag like "international" along with
gibberish. When attempting to ask him to remember 3 objects, he
was unable to repeat the objects immediately back. He would say
car, the first word, then go into a gibberish-laden story that
did not make sense.

CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN (Final [**2140-5-31**]): CRYPTOCOCCAL ANTIGEN NOT
DETECTED.

Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test (Final [**2140-5-31**]):
Respiratory viral antigens not detected. CULTURE CONFIRMATION
PENDING. SPECIMEN SCREENED FOR: ADENO,PARAINFLUENZA 1,2,3
INFLUENZA A,B AND RSV.

Imaging:
MRI: Findings are consistent with encephalitis and meningitis.
The pattern of temporal lobe involvement is characteristic for
herpes encephalitis, with increased signal intensity along the
cortical margin of the left and right insula, more on the left
than the right, and also along the cortical margin of the
anterior and medial left temporal lobes, likely reflecting an
ischemic component of these areas, and not simply T2
shine-through.

EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in drowsiness due

to the presence of disorganized severe focal and continuous
delta
frequency slowing in the left central temporal region. This
finding
suggests subcortical dysfunction in this region and is
consistent with
a mild and diffuse encephalopathy. No lateralization or
epileptiform
abnormalities were seen.

CT head: Hyperdense material consistent with acute
intraparenchymal hemorrhage located in the left temporal and
right frontal lobes with surrounding edema that on retrospective
view of limited brain images from the CT scan of the sinuses
dated [**2140-6-1**] also present. There is an additional stable low
attenuation lesion in the region of the right sylvian fissure
that appears to correspond to a region of increased T2 signal on
the previous MRI. There is slight left to right shift with mild
compression of the left lateral ventricle. If clinically
indicated, further evaluation with an MRI/MRA of the brain with
gadolinium may be performed.

CTA: 1. Small pulmonary embolus within a subsegmental branch of
the right pulmonary artery supplying the right lower lobe. Mild
bilateral lung base air space consolidation, left greater than
right. No air bronchograms are identified. Small bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left.
2. Small amount of free fluid within the pelvis.


Brief Hospital Course:
22 y/o male with asthma presented with seizures following 3
weeks of URI symptoms. found to have HSV meningoencephalitis,
whose course was complicated by intermittent fever, headaches,
and a pulmonary embolism.

1.)Meningoencephalitis: When Mr. [**Known lastname 60749**] presented, his
constellation of symptoms and findings lead everyone to believe
this was HSV meningoencephalitis.  He came from the outside
hospital with LP results consistent with an aseptic meningitis
(plus red cells, already making HSV more likely).  Here, at
[**Hospital1 18**], he had a repeat LP, again with a lymphocytosis and red
cells.  Multiple studies were sent off.  An MRI was performed
showing findings consistent with this presumed diagnosis (see
results section).  The patient was empirically started on IV
acyclovir and continued on the the ceftriaxone and vancomycin
that were started at the outside hospital until their culture
data came back negative, at which point he was transitioned to
acyclovir only.  In terms of his neurologic status, his main
deficit was cognitive, most specifically word-finding, with a
receptive and expressive aphasia.  Over the course of his
hospitalization, this slowly improved, though the expressive
deficit persisted, though to a lesser extent.  The
meningoencephalitis course was complicated by seizures at
presentation and intermittent headaches, as described below.  At
the time of discharge, his adenovirus titer was negative,
cryptococcal negative, RXV negative, adenovirus negative, VZV
negative, West [**Doctor First Name **] and EBV were pending.  He will likely need
outpatient speech therapy.  He will be followed by neurology and
ID as outpatient.
