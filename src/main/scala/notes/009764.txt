Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, splenic flexure takedown,
left colectomy, colonic intraoperative lavage, appendectomy,
colorectal anastomosis and gastrostomy


History of Present Illness:
82F with Sjogrens, vasculitis, GI bleed, HTN who p/w GIB. Pt was
recently admitted fr [**2177-1-1**] to [**2177-2-7**]. That extended admission,
pt initially p/w R popliteal DVT, renal failure, CHF, and
ascites, and was ultimately diagnosed with a poliferative GN, as
well as numerous other incidental findings. She was Tx
w/prednisone and Cytoxan and creatinine stabilized. Course was
c/b thrombocytopenia (etiology ultimately thought to be
Cytoxan). RIJ tunneled catheter was placed, and she was treated
for significant volume overload with UF.
.
Course also c/b palpable purpura, thought to be vasculitis
secondary to Sjogren's, hyponatremia, and was started on 10-day
course of vanc/zosyn for possible hospit-acquired PNA.
.
Her course was also c/b anemia, and a thorough GI workup was
undertaken:
-EGD showed gastritis/esophagitis
-colonoscopy showed proctitis with erythema and small ulcers,
diverticulosis, and grade 2 internal hemorrhoids, and a cecal
polyp.
.
Today, at nursing home, pt experienced ~500cc BRBPR and was
transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In ED NG lavage negative (250cc but no bilious return). She was
given 2U FFP. Pt was worked up by NF for planned medicine floor
admission. However, pt's Hct 35->28 & pt had large B.M. of
maroon-colored stool. GI contact[**Name (NI) **] & will see in AM. Plan ICU
monitoring given large blood loss.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 82F w/MMP including Sjogren's, renal failure secondary to
proliferative GN, RLE DVT, who represents to ED (on same day as
discharge after lengthy hospital stay) with GIB in setting of
coumadin anticoagulation.
.
# GIB: given FFP in ED, holding coumadin, follow INR, consider
vit K. After large maroon BMs in ED and Hct 35->28 (although
partly dilutional fr 2U FFP).
- follow serial Hcts. 2 large-bore PIVs. Ordered 2U PRBC. T&C
add'l units.
- GI saw pt in ED & plan flex sig in a few hours after saline or
tap water enemas
.
# RLE DVT - holding coumadin, given recurrent GIB, may require
filter.
.
# Proliferative GN/renal failure: Cr 2.7 now, somewhat increased
from recent baseline of 2.2, though was as high as 4.0 on recent
admission.
- Cont prednisone qd, has been weaning by 5mg per week on
alternating days (currently 50mg/45mg, started [**2177-2-3**])
- cont monthly Cytoxan (s/p 1st dose on [**1-17**])
- Cont lasix (80 daily), Calcitriol, Vit D, CaCO3
.
# PNA: recently started on empiric therapy for
?hospital-acquired PNA on vanco/zosyn
- was due for last vanco dose 1/8, will dose after level
returns.
- cont zosyn through [**2-10**]
.
# Hyponatremia: stable, continue fluid restriction 1500cc
.
# Anemia: likely multifactorial, w/ contribution from iron
deficiency, GI bleeds, and Cytoxan. Cont Epo Q M,W,Fr
.
# HTN: continue diltiazem, isordil (note: lopressor seems
associated w/hypothermia in this pt. Will avoid lopressor)
.
# Neuropathy: stable on Neurontin
.
# Sjogren's: stable currently. Continue artif tears, saliva
.
# Skin: pressure sores - has two sacral decubs. Nepro
supplementation, wound care.
.
# FEN: low sodium Renal diet; fluid restriction; follow lytes
PPI - bowel regimen, sc heparin
# PPX: sucralfate, PPI; NO pneumoboots given known DVT
# Access: PIV
# Code: full
# Dispo: back to rehab when stable
# Communication: questions about this patient and her complex
hosptial course may be directed to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

Patient was taken to OR on [**2-13**] for: Exploratory laparotomy,
splenic flexure takedown,
left colectomy, colonic intraoperative lavage, appendectomy,
colorectal anastomosis and gastrostomy

POD 1: Postoperatively she was admitted to the SICU and kept
intubated overnight. She was kept on Levo and Flagyl.
Heme-onc was consulted because of bleed and h/o DVT.
Following the labeling of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m red blood cells a GI bleed
study was performed over a 9 minute period. The study does not
demonstrate any
evidence of active GI bleeding.

POD 2 Vascular surgery was consulted and an A-gram showed: The
arterial blood supply of the right colon is unremarkable. There
is no evidence of active extravasation or early draining veins.
No active bleeding is noted in the small bowel. Note is made of
diffuse hyperemia of the entire small bowel in the parenchymal
space without evidence of active extravasation. The stomach and
duodenum are unremarkable on the celiac angiogram.  She
underwent bronchoscopy that did not show any mucous plugging.

POD 8 Pt was extubated.

POD 9 a duplex doppler:
REASON: Prior popliteal DVT. Evaluate for extension from the
tibial veins to the common femoral veins. There is no evidence
of thrombus obstruction. There is normal compression,
augmentation, and phasicity. Compared to the prior study, which
identified the right popliteal vein thrombus, there is nothing
visualized on the current study.

POD 10 a speach and swallow study showed:
The pt was able to tolerate small cup sips of nectar thick
liquid
and bites of puree without overt s/s of aspiration. She will
require assistance at meals. She will require cues to swallow 2X
per bite of food. Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 59987**] will likely not be able to
take in enough po at this time to maintain weight/nutritional
status and should continue being fed primarily via PEG, with
supplemental po's, with goal of weaning from tube feeds.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.DIET: Nectar thick liquids/pureed solids
 ** The pt should continue to be fed primarily via peg at this
    time with supplemental po's as stated above**
2.Pt will require assistance at meals
  Small cup sips of nectar thick liquid
  Always start meal with sips of liquid
  Pt should be cued to swallow 2X per bite
  Alternate between one bite food/one sip liquid

3.Consider nutrition consult to determine caloric/supplemental
  needs for pt receiving tube feeds and po's with goal to wean
  from peg

POD 13 Patient is being discharged on a Prednisone taper.Steroid
taper.  She is currently on prednisone 35 QD.
