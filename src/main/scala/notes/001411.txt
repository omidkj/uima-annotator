Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

Past Medical History:
Pt is a 82 yo female with h/o CAD, CHF, HTN, AF on coumadin,
and left MCA stroke in past who was found on floor beside her
bed
at [**Hospital3 537**].  The last time she was seen in her USOH was
the
night before.  The patient is intubated/sedated when I saw her,
so the history is from old notes and EMS sheets.  She was
apparently awake when they found her but incomprehensible.  She
has some aphasia and ? dementia after her old stroke, but the
severity is unknown.  She was brought to the ED as a trauma
patient and MI was also a concern.  She then had a head CT which
showed effacement of the sulci on the right in an MCA
distribution. Mild loss of G/W differentiation. No hyperdense
MCA
sign. It is difficult to tell exactly though given the changes
contralaterally from her old stroke.  A code stroke was called,
but as she was last seen before bed and is on coumadin, she is
not a candidate for intervention.  There is no record that she
was feling strangely before bed the night before.  How she came
to be on the floor is unknown.  She was intubated in the ED here
for airway protection, and was very agitated, so she was sedated
with propofol.  She is DNR/DNI by report/notes, but was
intubated
before this was known.  Her son is a physician and does wish to
leave the ET tube in for the time being.  She was unable to get
an MRI due to metal in her ETT.

Patient is unable to answer a ROS.


Social History:
Patient lives at [**Hospital3 537**] and is undergoing rehab. Her
son is in the area. No smoking/EtOH.


Family History:
Unknown


Physical Exam:
Admission Exam(most immediate exam performed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 23608**]
Gen: 82 yo female intubated and sedated,wearing c-spine collar,
squirming intermittently
Heent: Normocephalic/atraumatic, conj clear, mmm
Resp: cta b/l
CV: irreg irreg, nl s1/s2, 3/6 sem at llsb
abd: +b s/nd
extr: w/wp
neuro:
Mental Status: does not respond to verbal commands to open eyes
or show thumb, but grasps with right hand and steps down with
right foot when instructed.  no spontaneous eye-opening.
CN: Pupils equal and round 2mm, right non-reactive, left with
some hippus.  Unable to assess oculocephalic reflex due to
c-spine collar. Unable to assess facial symmetry due to collar.
+Corneal reflex bilaterally. +Gag. No forced eye deviation.
Difficult to assess visual fields as blink-to-threat is
inconsistent.
Motor: grasps right hand on command with 4+/5 strength,
plantarflexes right foot with 5/5 strength; does not hold up any
extremities on command; spontaneously moves right arm and both
legs - seems to have left-sided neglect as she does not follow
commands to plantarflex left foot, but can spontaneously move it
Reflexes: dtr's absent in le's, 1+ and symmetric in ue's, toes
tonically upgoing bilaterally
Sensory: withdraws to pain with right arm, right leg, and left
leg, but left arm with decerebrate posturing in response to
pain.

(later, she was moving left leg spont, but still only posturing
her left arm)


Pertinent Results:
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again seen is a large area of
decreased attenuation within the right cerebral hemisphere
consistent with an evolving right MCA infarct. Additionally,
there has been interval hemorrhage within this measuring 4.2 x
2.6 cm in maximum dimension, with increased mass effect and
obscuration of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle,
with focal increased shift of the midline adjacent to this.
Additionally, there is a tiny focus of increased density within
the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, which appears
to demonstrate layering, and likely represents intraventricular
hemorrhage suggesting a subarachnoid component. The caliber of
the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles is stable. Again
seen is an area of decreased attenuation within the left
parietal region consistent with prior left MCA infarct. There is
decreased attenuation of the white matter adjacent to the left
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], which is stable in appearance. The basal
cisterns are stable in appearance. The Foramen of [**Doctor Last Name 23609**] is
patent. There appears to be some narrowing of the third
ventricle, however, this is patent. The soft tissue and osseous
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Again seen is evolving large right MCA infarct.
There has been interval hemorrhage within this, with compression
of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, and
increased mass effect with slight shift of midline structures.
There is a focus of intraventricular hemorrhage
within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. These
results were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1104**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4638**] at 12 p.m. on
[**2100-10-3**].

  RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2100-10-2**] 7:01 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old woman with ms changes s/p fall

HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is diffuse hypoattenuation
within the right frontal, parietal, and temporal regions with
narrowing of the sulci and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation,
findings suggestive of an evolving infarction. Stable area of
hypodensity is again seen in the distribution of the left middle
cerebral artery with associated encephalomalacia changes and
exvacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle. There is no
intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage or shift of midline structures.
Configuration of the ventricles is stable since the prior
examination. Basal cisterns are within normal limits. Mild
mucosal thickening is seen involving the ethmoid air cells
anteriorly. Remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid
air cells are clear. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Area of hypoattenuation within the distribution of the right
middle cerebral artery with narrowing of the sulci and loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white differentiation suggestive of an evolving
infarction.

2. Stable appearance of left cerebral middle artery territory
remote infarction.

3. No intracranial hemorrhage.








Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Neurology ICU for management of
her large right MCA stroke. Unfortunately, her clinical
condition worsened and repeat head imaging noted hemorrhageic
transformation of the stroke with interventricular extension.
After discussion with her family, the patient was extubated and
administered comfort measure level of care. She expired from
respiratory failure at 800AM [**2101-10-5**]

Discharge Disposition:
Expired

Discharge Diagnosis:
