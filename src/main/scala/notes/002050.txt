=========================================
Studies of note:
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-8-2**] 1:31 PM
1. Interval improvement of bilateral pleural effusions, now
moderate to large on left and moderate on right.
2. Interval progression of congestive heart failure.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-8-2**] 4:26 AM
1. Probably large, layering bilateral pleural effusions with
upper zone vascular redistribution suggestive of pulmonary
edema.
2. Dense opacification of the retrocardiac left lower lobe.
While this could represent atelectasis in the context of pleural
effusion, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
# ECG  Study Date of [**2115-8-2**]  4:38:22 AM
Sinus rhythm. Within normal limits. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2115-5-27**] no significant diagnostic change.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-8-3**] 3:34 AM
IMPRESSION: Improving interstitial pulmonary edema with
persistent bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
61F h/o ESRD [**12-21**] DM2 not yet on HD, presented with increased
SOB, BLE edema, and hypertensive urgency [**12-21**] CHF.
.
# SOB: Pt's SOB was considered likely [**12-21**] either to pulmonary
edema [**12-21**] either ESRD vs PNA per CXR.  After receiving one
empirically dose of levofloxacin, pt was diuresed in the ED with
furosemide 100mg IV, leading to UOP 650cc and marked improvement
of SOB.  Levofloxacin was stopped and pt was continued on
furosemide 100mg IV PRN for a diuresis goal of 2L in the MICU.
Upon transfer to the floor, pt had SpO2=100/RA and continued to
be monitored for respiratory status.  Pt was changed to
furosemide PO.  After starting HD, pt was d/c'd without
furosemide and had ambulatory SaO2 = 97%.
.
# HTN: Pt reported baseline SBP=170s, but was found to have
SBP=240s on admit.  Pt was therefore placed on a nitroglycerin
gtt, with Toprol XL increased to 300mg daily and amlodipine
increased to 10mg PO daily.  As volume overload was considered
the likely primary cause of pt's HTN, pt was diuresed with
furosemide IV with good effect.  Pt was also started on
minoxidil 5 mg PO daily for improved SBP control.  Upon transfer
to the floor, pt had SBP=139-163, and continued to be monitored
for BP control.  After beginning HD, however, pt's BPs
normalized and she was discharged with only Toprol XL 150mg
daily.
.
# ESRD: Pt had ESRD but had not been started on HD.  Renal was
consulted and initially determined there was no acute indication
for HD.  Pt was therefore continued on her home regimen of
calcitriol and darbepoetin alfa.  However, pt was noted to have
persistent nausea and vomiting from uremia, and therefore was
ultimately started on HD.  Pt was discharged with sevelamer
800mg TID with meals and nephrocaps 1 cap daily.
.
# DM2: On admission, pt did not know her home insulin regimen,
and HbA1c = 8.5%.  The insulin regimen from pt's prior discharge
summary was therefore applied, using insulin 70/30 29 units QAM,
10 units QPM, and HISS.  While on this previous fixed dose
regimen, however, pt experienced one episode of hypoglycemia
while on the floor, with BG to 40s.  Pt's insulin needs were
therefore calculated after placing her only on humalog sliding
scale, and pt was discharged on NPH 10 units at breakfast and
NPH 6 units at dinner.
.
# CAD:  Pt ruled out for MI, with negative CE x3 and EKG
demonstrating no acute changes.  Pt was continued on her home
regimen of ASA.  Toprol XL was increased from her original home
regimen of 200mg daily to 300mg daily, with improved SBP
control.  After beginning HD, pt was discharged on a reduced
dose of Toprol XL 150mg daily.
.
# LFTs: To be screened for outpatient HD placement, laboratories
were drawn to assess LFTs and hepatitis serologies.  Pt was
negative for HBV and HCV infection, but ALT and alk phos were
found to be slightly elevated. This could be due to congestive
hepatopathy. Pt was informed that it may be useful to follow up
on these LFTs (if they persist to be abnormal) by liver
ultrasound as an outpatient.
