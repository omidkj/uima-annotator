Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion and PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
65 year old female with chief complaint of "abdominal
discomfort" X1 month. She does not characterize it as pain but
she has this ongoing diffuse discomfort from her breastbone all
the way down to her suprapubis. She describes it as being worse
during the evening when she is lying down. In fact, it was so
bad the night before last, she had to get up several times and
was unable to sleep. She also describes persistent cough
associated with shortness of breath, which is markedly worse
recently. She denies chest pain, arm pain or jaw pain. She notes
that she is quite uncomfortable and fatigued.
.
She presented to [**Company 191**] and was sent via ambulance to the ED for
further evaluation with concern for CHF.
.
ED Course: Initial VS-99.4 HR91 BP 170/93 20 99%RA. CT scan
done, notable for Subsegmental PE and moderate pericardial
effusion. No pulsus documented, ?done, No note by Cards-did not
see pt in ED. Pt was HD stable throughout ED course, in fact
hypertensive w/o any cardiac meds given. Started Hep gtt sent to
MICU for unclear reason as no tamponade physiology.
.
MICU course (< 24 hrs):  In the MICU, she was HD stable.  She
was continued on heparin gtt and had a TTE which showed a
loculated pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology.  She
was also give IVF and lasix for hypercalcemia.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, she states that her abdominal
discomfort has gotten significantly better.  She has no dyspnea
when resting but does have dyspnea when walking (this has been
getting worse over the past month).  + "dark stools" X 1 wk.
She states she has had a colonoscopy about 2 yrs ago but no
doccumentation in OMR.  She has had a dry cough X 1 month.  No
LE swelling.  No long trips.  Does live a fairly sedentary
lifestyle.  She does endorse neck weakness and shoulder and neck
pain (chronic).

IMAGING:
CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiomegaly with moderate pericardial effusion and
interstitial edema.
2. At least two small subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the
left lower lobe. No aortic dissection.
3. Diffuse patchy opacities at the lung bases with prominent air
trapping. These findings can be seen inpatient with asthma/small
airway disease. However, the findings are nonspecific. Clinical
correlation is recommended.
4. Left adrenal nodule of indeterminate appearance. MRI can be
performed for further evaluation.
.
PELVIC CT:
The patient returned for imgaing of the pelvis which revealed no
acute abnormality.
.
[**12-25**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction
30 percent) secondarty to severe hypokinesis of the inferior
septum, inferior free wall, and posterior wall. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and  no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There  is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small
to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
loculated. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2183-8-19**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
further reduced.

Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 65 yo F w/MMP admitted for PE.  Hospital course on the floor
complicated by:
.
#. PE: Considered to be idiopathic as no cause identified.  Has
a history of femoral artery thrombosis but this was likely [**2-13**]
femoral artery stenosis and PE should be from venous thrombosis.
 Also concerning for possible underlying malignancy or other
hypercoaguable state.  She has no know history of malignancy.
[**2181**] mammogram negative.  Per pt. negative colonoscopy 2 years
ago.  She had TAH/BSO for fibroids.  CT torso not concern
