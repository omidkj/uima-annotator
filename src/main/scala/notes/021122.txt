Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3853**]
Chief Complaint:
"Abdominal Pain."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
87 year old Male with CAD s/p MIx2, CABG, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
chronic renal insuff, gout, BPH who presented with lower
abdominal pain since this morning. His pain started this morning
and he had one episode of emesis in the afternoon. He has been
passing flatus. However, he reports no fevers, chills, nausea,
cough, and malaise. On presentation to the ED from OSH, his
abdominal pain had subsided.
.
He was initially seen at OSH ([**Hospital6 3105**]) where
his
abdominal pain was severe ([**9-2**]). He had a loose non-bloody BM
there after going 5 days without having had any which resulted
in some pain relief (unclear if it was guiac positive). At OSH
he received kayexalate for a K of 6 and has had diarrhea since
then, with significant improvement in his pain. He remained
hemodynamically stable in the OSH. He was given levo/flagyl. A
non contrast CT performed there was concerning for left-sided
colitis and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive
management.
.
Moreover, over the past year patient has had multiple admissions
for pneumonia for which he has been treated for broad-spectrum
ABx. However last bout was 5 days before admission. He has been
on antibiotics (OD, 'pink pill', most likely levoflox) until
admission today. CT conducted in OSH incidentally suggested left
lower lobe "pneumonias". However the patient reports no change
in baseline cough or sputum production
.
[**Hospital1 18**] ED Course: In the ED, vital signs were 99.4 90 77/44 18
92% on room air. Abdominal pain had subsided (0/10). There was
no fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, dysuria,
hematochezia. Nausea/vomiting was present. An EKG performed in
the ED described the patient to be in SR with an HR of 90 with a
primary AV block IVCD. Initial lactate was  3.1 @ [**2117**] which was
improved to 1.9 @ 2200. K was 5.6 (no kayexlate given) and
BUN/CR was 62/2.8. Alt 89*, AST 124*, AlkPhos 150*. Patient was
put on flagyl and IV fluids. Surgery was consulted who did not
believe a surgical intervention was indicated. systolics
improved to 110-100 without pressors; patient recieved 3L NS in
the ED. No abx were administered. Tmax in ED was 99.4. Became
hypoxic (92% on RA).
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was vitally stable and well
oriented. He was in minimla pain and [**Last Name (un) 8692**] blood pressure was
stable.

IMAGING:
TTE [**2199-9-18**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is top normal/borderline dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the
distal third of the left ventricle, the mid to distal anterior
wall and septum, and the apex (EF 40-45%). Doppler parameters
are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild
aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild thoracic
aortic dilation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 87M w CAD s/p MI, CABG, HTN, hyperlipidemia, gout,
BPH, who presented from OSH w/ 1 day of abdominal pain [**12-26**]
colitis.

Active Issues:
#Diverticulitis: CT abdomen at OSH showed left sided colitis.
Patient was initially admitted to MICU due to hypotension (SBP
70s).  He was evaluated by the surgical service, who felt that
his rapid improvement lowered the likelihood of ischemic
colitis, but more likely diverticulitis.  He was started on IV
cipro/flagyl.  C diff
