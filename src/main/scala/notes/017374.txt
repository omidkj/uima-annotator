Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cardiac cath with PCI to LAD x3
Intra-aortic balloon pump


History of Present Illness:
87 yo female with PMH CAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM admitted to
[**Hospital 1474**] hospital with complaints of intermittent chest pain for
several days preceding admission. Six months ago, she had chest
pain and was admitted to the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital where she
said she was exercised and was told she should have a cardiac
cath but refused it at her age.

This time, pt complained of severe chest pain at lower
substernal area with SOB, lightheadedness, and n/v when doing
housework 6 days ago. Unable to determine pain rate. Chest pain
radiated to left arm, lasted more than 30 minutes. Did not take
medicine, diminished by resting. Denied palpitations, orthopnea,
or edema. She called her grandson who suggesting going to the
hospital. She called an ambulance and was taken to [**Hospital **]
hospital where they found anterolateral ST elevation and +trop
2.9 consistent with anterior ST elevation MI. Pt was initially
medically managed. Was started on lovenox and transferred here
for cardiac cath.

[**2172-9-28**] TTE: Conclusions:
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely
depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to
akinesis of the
anterior free wall, apex, and interventricular septum; the basal
and
midventricular segments of the inferior, posterior, and lateral
walls contract
normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The
aortic valve is not well seen. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.

[**2172-9-29**] CXR:
Interval decrease in bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.
consistent with resolving pulmonary edema.
.

[**2172-9-29**] TTE:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection
fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis
of the
anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex; the inferior free
wall is
hypokinetic as well. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right
ventricular cavity is dilated. There is focal hypokinesis of the
apical free
wall of the right ventricle. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
to moderate
([**11-22**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a
moderate sized
pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
with blood,
inflammation or other cellular elements. The effusion appears
loculated around
the right ventricular free wall. There are no echocardiographic
signs of
tamponade. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

.

[**2172-9-30**] CXR: : No pneumothorax. Left lower lobe
atelectasis/consolidation. Small focal opacity consistent with
consolidation in right mid-zone. Probable small bilateral
pleural effusions.
.

[**2172-9-30**] TTE:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of
the septum, distal inferior wall and apex and hypokinesis of the
distal half
of the anterior wall. No aneurysm or masses or thrombi are seen
in the left
ventricle. masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
.

[**2172-10-2**] TTE: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
small apical
aneurysm. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Very small
circumferential
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2172-10-2**] CXR:
There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is mild
pulmonary edema. There are left lower lobe opacifiactions which
are improving. Again seen is biapical pleural thickening.
.
[**2172-10-5**] CXR:
improvement in bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion.
Bilateral pleural effusion also have decreased in size since the
prior study. The left lower lobe remains atelectatic. There is
no evidence of pneumothoraces.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Pt started on lovenox and transferred here for elective
cath. Left heart ventriculography showed mild mitral
regurgitation; severely hypokinetic anterolateral, anteroapical,
and mid to distal inferior walls; and LVEF 25%. Coronary
angiography showed a right dominant system with LAD with tandem
95% and 90% mid vessel lesions with TIMI 2 flow at the start of
the case, 60% ostial lesion of LCx, large branching OM1 with 80%
stenosis in the upper pole and 85% stenosis in the lower pole at
the birfurcation,
