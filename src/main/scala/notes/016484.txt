Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Melena

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- [**7-12**] Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with endoclip placement &
epinephrine injections
- Packed red blood cell transfusion (4 units total)

History of Present Illness:
88 year old male with PMHx coronary artery disease s/p CABG,
sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker, congestive heart failure,
TIA, diabetes, BPH, Billroth I for peptic ulcer disease w/
subsequent GI bleed in [**2156**] who presents with melena X three
days. The patient states that he has had crampy abdominal pain
and black, loose stools for the last three days, without
associated nausea/vomiting, no hematemesis or BRBPR. He endorses
lightheadedness, left-sided chest pain with radiation to jaw X1
(today).
.
Of note, the patient had melena in [**2156**] while on aspirin, plavix
and Vioxx and was found to have a bleeding ulcer on the gastric
side of his Bilroth I anastamosis then on EGD. The ulcer was
Epi'd/bicap'd. Hpylori serology at the time was negative. The
patient was discharged on PPI, off plavix X 3 weeks, off aspirin
6 weeks and no other NSAIDs. Follow-up EGD in [**2161**] showed
gastritis.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T 97.2, HR94, BP101/56, RR 16, 98% on RA.
The patient was guaiac positive on rectal exam, with maroon
stool in rectal vault. He received IVF, had two large bore IVs
placed, and GI consulted. NG lavage with 750cc normal saline
yielded bright red blood, never cleared. The patient received
pantoprazole 80mg IV X1 and was admitted to the MICU. On
transfer, VS: afebrile, HR67, BP102/45, RR16, 100% on RA.

# EKG

Normal sinus rhythm (HR ~75), normal axis, prolonged QTc 477
with left bundle branch block, intermittently paced. No ST
elevations/T wave inversions. Bigeminy.

# IMAGING

[**2164-7-12**] EGD
Impression:
- Abnormal mucosa in the stomach
- Blood in the stomach
- Oozing of blood noted at the gastrojej site, with possible
underlying visible vessel noted. Hemostasis initially achieved
with epinephrine. Bleeding recurred after first endoclip placed
at possible visible vessel, confirming source of bleed. Another
endoclip was placed achieving hemostasis. (injection, endoclip)
- Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum
- Recommendations: Bleeding at gastrojejunal site with
hemostasis achieved. Continue IV PPI drip. Keep NPO for now
- Repeat EGD in future to evaluate thickened gastric fold.

[**2164-7-14**] CXR (PA/Lat)
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-13**], the cardiac
enlargement does not seem as prominent, though much of this
could reflect the PA rather than AP supine position. Diffuse
areas of opacification bilaterally have decreased, suggesting
that they may have represented asymmetric pulmonary edema. The
possibility of residual pneumonia in addition to some continued
elevation of pulmonary venous pressure must be considered. Pacer
leads are in standard position and unchanged.

# MICROBIOLOGY

[**7-13**] CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2164-7-14**]):
      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
     (Reference Range-Negative).
[**7-12**]  MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2164-7-15**]):    No MRSA isolated.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 year old male with PMHx coronary artery disease s/p CABG,
sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker, sCHF (EF 40%,'[**59**]), TIA, BPH,
Billroth I for peptic ulcer disease w/ subsequent GI bleed in
[**2156**] who presented with melena.
.
# Melena: Patient presented with 3 days of melena and was found
to have a hematocrit of 18.5 from 36.0 three weeks ago. He was
admitted to the intensive care unit where EGD revealed a
bleeding ulcer at the gastrojejunal junction that was injected
with epinephrine and clipped. He received a total of 4 units
PRBCs. Patient remained hemodynamically stable with a stable
hematocrit and was transferred to the general medical floor. He
remained on a pantoprazole drip for 72 hours after endoscopy,
then was switched to pantoprazole 40mg by mouth twice a day per
GI recommendation. He will need to take this for 8 weeks total
([**7-16**]); then he should take pantoprazole 20mg by
mouth indefinitely and follow up with his gastroenterologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**]. He continued to have dark, formed bowel movements.
Diet was advanced slowly and patient was tolerating regular
(low-salt, diabetic) diet for >48 hours prior to discharge.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Baseline creatinine <1.1, was mildy
elevated to 1.3 on admission. Likely prerenal, secondary to
hypovolemia from blood loss. He was volume resuscitated with
PRBC transfusion and IVF. Cr was 1.3 on the day of discharge;
patient received 1L NS.
.
# Clostridium difficile colitis: Treatment complete and repeat
C. diff PCR on [**7-13**] is negative. Patient had a C.dif
