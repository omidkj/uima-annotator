Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP


History of Present Illness:
89 yo male with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and
hypertension was admitted with RUQ pain and jaundice.
.
Patient initially presented to an OSH with one day of RUQ pain
and several days of jaundice. At OSH, he was noted to have
elevated LFTs, and dilation of common bile ducts but with no
evidence of gallstones. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and management of cholangitis.
.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], vital signs were temp (not done), HR 70,
BP 106/60, RR 16, and pulse ox 96% on room air.  Exam was
notable for jaundice and RUQ tenderness. Surgery was consulted
and discussed surgery. Given his age and comorbidities, he was
thought to be a poor candidate for surgery and was instead
evaluated for ERCP.

Pertinent Results:
ERCP

Biliary stricture compatible with probable pancreatic neoplasm
Pancreatic duct was partially filled and was grossly dilated
Cytology was taken from the biliary stricture
A biliary stent was placed with good flow of bile thereafter
Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus- cytology taken

An EGD was perfomed prior to commencing the ERCP to ensure
patency of the duodenum.
Note was made of a grossly abnormal esophagus which was friable.

The mucosa above the GE junction was very abnormal and
suspicious for malignancy ( no mass was seen)
Brushings were taken (biopsies were not possible due to INR 2.4)

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old man with h/o DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, atrial
fibrillation, and recent falls who was sent in from OSH with RUQ
pain, jaundice, and leukocytosis concerning for cholecystis and
pancreatic malignancy.
.
CT of abdomen was positive for common bile duct and pancreatic
duct dilation. Total bilirubin was elevated to 11.2 range. Also
he had marked transaminitis with 1345, ALT 871, ALP 2711. On ICU
admission, he had features of looming sepsis. He was started on
Levofloxacin, flagyl, and Vancomycin. On EGD, he was found to
have grossy abnormal esophagous suspicious for malignancy and
cytologic brushings were taken. On ERCP, there was a biliary
stricture compatible with probable pancreatic neoplasm. A stent
was placed and cytology sample was taken.  He was also found to
have a dilated stomach and possible outlet stenosis( from
pancreatic head lesion?). Following the procedure, he was
extubated without complication and remained stable in the ICU.
He was then transferred to the floor on broad spectrum
antibiotics. I met with the family who decided on hospice care
and against further diagnostic tests or treatment. Hospice care
was arranged at home.
.
#Hypotension - He has a known history of HTN. His BPs responded
well to 2L-3L IVFs and returned to the 120s/60s range. As noted
above, abx were started and fluid administered out of concern
for early sepsis, however, blood were cxs negative to date.
Bblocker was initially held but restarted when pressures
stabilized.
.
#Atrial fibrillation- unclear if this is a new diagnosis. we
decided against anticoagulation because of hospice care. He
received rate control only.
.
#Anemia: Pt with normocytic anemia while in the ICU.  No obvious
source of bleed at this time, with non-bloody G tube drainage
and no evidence of bloody stools.  Suspect this is primarily
dilutional as crit drop was preceeded by agressive rehydration.

.
#Recent PNA: Noted to have RLL infiltrate on recent
hospitalization on [**7-27**] at [**Hospital6 33**]. He was on a
course of Levaquin which was due to be completed on [**2151-8-6**].
Current CXR still showing infiltrate. Patient states his recent
cough and sputum production improving but still has leukocytosis
which is more likely related to cholangitis given recent labs
and imaging but PNA still in differential in terms of
contributing causes for his leukocytosis.  While in the ICU,
levaquin was continued and pt initially require high flow O2 by
face mask, weaned to NC at transfer from ICU. On the floor, he
was continued on Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Flagyl. He was then
changed to oral flagyl and Ciprofloxacin as he was discharged to
hospice care to finnish treatment for cholangitits and pneumonia

He was discharged home on hospice care. We adniced follow up
with PCP and GI regarding his biliary stent if needed.
