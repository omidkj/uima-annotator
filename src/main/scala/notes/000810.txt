Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 88 yo male with h/o CHF (EF 45%), CAD, CKD, TIIDM
admitted to the MICU from rehab with hypotension, junctional
bradycardia, and mental status change [**2131-5-16**]. The patient was
admitted to [**Hospital3 1196**] [**Date range (1) 39358**] after a
mechanical fall and treated for UTI and CHF exacerbation. He was
discharged to [**Hospital 18979**] rehab on [**2131-5-5**]. For the past few days he
complained of worsening weakness and fatigue. He was noted to be
bradycardic and metoprolol was held as of [**2131-5-15**]. On the day of
admission he was found to be hypotensive (SBP 90s), bradycardic
(HR 30s), and with mental status changes; he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.
.
In the ER the pt was in a junctional rhythm with a rate in the
30s and was treated with atropine. He was treated for
hyperkalemia and also given glucagon due to beta-blockade. He
reverted to NSR with rate in the 60s. The patient was intubated
in the ER for mental status changes and airway production in
setting of uremia and patient vomiting. He was seen by
cardiology who thought the bradycardia was secondary to
hyperkalemia, which was secondary to renal failure, and
recommended dialysis. Renal was consulted and did not believe
dialysis was indicated at this time.

Past Medical History:

diabetic nephropathy

CHF (EF 45% echo [**2131-4-25**] with inferior hypokinesis, left atrial
enlargement)
Chronic 02 requirement of 2.5 L NC for CHF
Hypothyroidism
h/o Proteus UTI
Vertigo
Left eye blindness s/p childhood accident
HOH R ear
s/p recent mechanical fall


Social History:
Lives with wife. [**Name (NI) **] three daughters, two that live in the area
and visit twice a week.


Family History:

Gen: intubated, sedated male in NAD
HEENT: right pupil reactive, left opacified, anicteric, MMM
Neck: supple, JVP nondistended
Cardio: bradycardic with reg rhythm, nl S1 S2, no m/r/g

Ext: 2+ peripheral edema (R>L); decreased DP and PT pulses B


Pertinent Results:
[**5-21**] chest ct:
1. No evidence of that moderate to large right pleural effusion
is anything other than a transudate. Relaxation atelectasis
probably responsible for collapsed right middle and lower lobe.

2. Mild mediastinal adenopathy could be due to congestive heart
failure.

3. Severe atherosclerosis, predominantly in coronaries, also in
the aorta, innominate artery, and upper abdomen.

4. Probable pulmonary arterial hypertension. Mild cardiomegaly.
Aortic valvular calcification, hemodynamic significance
uncertain.

5. Ascites.

6. No evidence of sternotomy complications.

ecg:
Normal sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block. Cannot
exclude prior
inferior myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2131-5-18**] no
diagnostic interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 88yo male with h/o TIIDM, CAD, CHF, CKD p/w hyperkalemia,
bradycardia, hypotension, and acute on chronic renal failure.
Admitting diagnoses improved on discharge. Pt discharged to
rehab for PT/OT.
.
1) Bradycardia/hypotension/hyperkalemia: Likely multifactorial
due to hyperkalemia in the setting of beta-blocker and
amiodarone in addition to the recent diagnosis of
hypothyroidism. Initial rhythm was junctional bradycardia in 40s
which improved to sinus rhythm/sinus brady with atropine,
treatment of hyperkalemia, and increase of levothyroxine. Blood
pressure also improved with treatment of bradycardia. The pt had
no further episodes of bradycardia after his initial
stabilization. Amiodarone and metoprolol were restarted in the
intensive care unit prior to transfer to the floor.
.
2) Renal Failure: Current presentation likely acute on chronic
renal failure due to overdiuresis (and subsequent CHF
precipitated by volume load to treat hypovolemia). Etiology of
CKD most likely diabetic nephropathy. Nephrology believes he
will need dialysis within the year. [**Last Name (un) **] discontinued during
hospitalization and was not restarted on discharge. Recent creat
2.0-2.6 at OSH; 2.2 on discharge. Pt was followed in house by
nephrology, who by discharge recommended: discontinuing renagel,
decreasing calcium to 500mg tid, decreasing lasix to 40mg po qd
to decrease risk of hypovolemia, and continuing epogen 10,000u
qmwf. Pt discharged with caudet catheter and is scheduled for
follow-up with urology. Pt will follow-up with nephrology
locally as he will need close observation.
.
3) CHF: Diastolic dysfunction with EF 60% and home O2
requirement of 2.5L. Pt diuresed with lasix IV and po.
Outpatient regimen of ASA, metoprolol, statin continued; [**Last Name (un) **]
discontinued because of ARF. At dry weight and baseline O2
requirement on discharge. Lasix 40mg po qd on discharge with
care not to overdiurese. Pt will follow-up with his cardiology
at [**Hospital1 **].
.
4) Right pleural effusion: The pt received a
therapeutic/diagnostic thoracentesis for non-resolving right
pleural effusion the day prior to discharge. 2L fluid removed,
with subjective improvement in dyspnea. The effusion was found
to be transudative and is most likely secondary to heart
failure. The effusion is less likely secondary to infection in
this pt who remained afebrile and appear nontoxic. Gram stain
negative, although cultures pending. Also of concern is
malignant effusion in setting of ascites. Pleural fluid culture
and cytology will need follow-up.
.
5) Ascites/liver function: Likely secondary to right heart
failure; RUQ showed no liver pathology. Repeat US showed mild
ascites. Improved with diuresis. Repeat LFTs showed resolved
transaminases with alk phos 192, GGT 147, total bili 0.3. Pt
without symptoms of biliary disease. Recommend follow-up LFTs
for resolution within one month of discharge.
.
6) CAD: Pt denied CP during admission. Outpatient regimen of
ASA, lipitor, and metoprolol continued; as above, [**Last Name (un) **] held for
ARF.
.
7) TIIDM: QID FS's, RISS. Glyburide held in house with adequate
blood sugar control; consider restarting as outpatient as
needed.
