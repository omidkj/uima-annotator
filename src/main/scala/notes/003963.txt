Chief Complaint:
L leg hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
83 yo F with CDIP s/p IVIG and atrial fibrillation on coumadin
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with diaphoresis and hypotension. At her
nursing home she injured her left leg during tranfer from shower
to chair. She was transferred initially to an OSH, SBPs were
noted to be in the 60s resolving spontaneously and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]> ON admission her labs were notable from a
Hct of 24 (baseline 30-33) and INR of 5.1. There was concern for
RP bleed. She received to [**Location 16678**] and Vit K in the evening of
[**6-27**] and 1 unit of pRBCS with appropriate increase but lost her
IV access. Multiple attempts on the floor to place an EJ and
PIVs were unsuccessful and she was transferred to the MICU for
closer monitoring of hematocrit and placement of central access.
BP on transfer was 120/60.

In the ICU, RIJ was placed. CT abdomen showed no evidence of an
RP bleed, instead a left thigh hematoma without extension was
seen. Lowest noed Hct was 18.5 on [**6-28**] in the AM. She received
an additional 4 units of pRBCS and 2 units FFP that evening. Hct
stabilized at 27. She was never hemodynamically stable. Hcts are
now being cycled [**Hospital1 **]. Vascular was consulted for concern of
compartment syndrome due to poor function of lower extremities
due to baseline neurological disease. However this exam finding
was not acute and patient has good peripheral pulses, without
significant pain.

Patient also had a new complain of left arm pain where a bruise
and left upper extremity edema was noted. LUE ulstrasound noted
no DVT, but did suggest hematoma or synovial swelling.

Left femur fx: [**2192-6-26**]
There is no fracture or dislocation. Tricompartmental
degenerative changes are seen within the knee with joint space
narrowing, subchondral cystic and sclerotic changes, and
osteophyte formation. Moderate hip osteoarthritis is also seen
on the left with osteophytic spurring, joint space narrowing and
subchondral sclerosis. No focal lytic or sclerotic osseous
abnormality is present. No fracture or dislocation is present.

CT abdoman/ pelvis w/o contrast: [**6-28**]
1. Large left thigh hematoma, without active extravasation or
underlying
fracture.
2. Multiple renal cysts, with questionable hyperdense lesion in
left mid
pole. Recommend ultrasound for further evaluation.

Left Elbow lateral/AP [**6-29**]:
Technically limited study with no true frontal view. No evidence
of a fracture, dislocation, or posterior fat pad indicating
joint effusion.

Unilateral LUE u/s: No DVT

CXR [**7-2**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. No overhydration. No focal parenchymal opacity
suggesting pneumonia. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
No hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo F with CDIP and AF on coumadin transferred to the MICU for
monitering of acute blood loss  in the setting of a L thigh.

On admission it was unclear what the source of her blood loss
was, thought ot be RP bleed. Given the rapidity of the blood
loss, she was transferred to the ICU.  Pt was noted to be
supratherapeutic.  There was no evidence of GIB.  RIJ triple
lumen was placed as patient has poor access.  She was given
Vitamin K and FFP to maintain an INR <1.5.  CT non contrast of
abdomen pelvis showed left thigh hematroma, without pelvic or
hip fracutre and without RP bleed.  There was initially concern
for compartment syndrome due to the increased firmness of the
left leg.  Vascular was consulted.  Pt continued to have
palpable DP pulses with function of her lower extremity and
recommended q4h neuro and vascular checks to ensure stability.
Pt eperienced some low grade fevers in the setting of hematoma
and truma.  She was pan cultured but there was no evidence of
infection.  She remained asymptomatic and prior to transfer to
the medical floor her fevers stopped.  She was given a total of
5 units of pRBCs and 4 units FFP in the ED and ICU.  Her Hct was
relatively stable prior to transfer to the floor.  Given a slow
drift of hematocrit she was again transfused two additional
units.  After which her respiratory status worsened.  She was
also generally edematous due to the volume she had received.
She was given IV lasix with improvement of her respiratory
status.  She was also given an incentive spirometer to reduce
atelectasis. At time of discharge her Hct was 32.5 and stable
for 48 hrs.

#Atrial fibrillation: Patient was s/p TEE cardioversion in
[**11/2191**], and rate controlled. Her CHADS-2 score is 2, warranting
anticoagulation She was continued on her  metoprolol and
amiodarone, but given active bleeding resuming anticoagulation
and aspirin therapy will be deferred for outpt as discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on day of discharge.

# Troponin leak: Patient with mild troponin leak of 0.02 on
admission (baseline troponin leak of 0.02 back in 3/[**2192**]). No
chest pain or SOB. However, patient has new LBBB on EKG,
although she has had intermittent LBBB in the past.   Thought to
be secondary to stress from injury.  She was continued on BB and
statin.  ASA treatment was deferred given bleed.

# Asthma/COPD: continue ipratropium, q6h, standing

# Constipation: Pt is chronically constipated.  It is very
important to uptitrate bowel regimen as needed to ensure regular
bowel movements.

#Pain - Pt on oxycodone for pain given hematoma.  Given
constipating effect of this medication.  Please down titrate
narcotics in favor of naprosyn or other non constipating
medication to control pain.

#Back and leg pain: Pt on standing Tylenol and
# Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
