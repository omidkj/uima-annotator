Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo m w/ chf, avr, ms, w/ h/o vomiting, fever, cough, febrile
on admission, tachycardic, w/ elev lactate, and no obvious
source of infxn.
.
1) sepsis- On arrival to the ICU pt afebrile c no WBC but
tachyc, tachypneic c increased lactate. CT of chest showed L pul
infiltrate. CT abdomen showed GB wall thickening but no evid of
GI source. Pt empirically coverd c ceftriaxone, vancomycin and
flagyl. Pt developed rash in UE after one vancomycin
administration, so abx given more slowly subsequently. No
additional reaction noted.  Bedside swallow showed pt at risk
for aspiration and so this likely contributed to his development
of pna.

2. Fluids- elev cvp but pt likely always runs high given known
severe MS.  Concerned that patient was relatively hypovolemic
given h/o vomiting, elev lactate; therefore, initially given IVF
boluses despite elevated CVP.
.
2) chf- Pt significantly overweight but as stated previously
concern for hypovolemia. Therefore was bolused with fluid. Fluid
status balanced between diuresis for possible volume overload in
the lungs and need for increased perfusion to the tissues. On
[**2136-8-3**] pt hypotensive c decreased RR and fixed and dilated L
pupil. Pt's liver and cardiac enzymes as well as his lactate
elevated, indicating inadequate perfusion of his end organs. Pt
given ASA for cardiac damage [**Hospital1 **] sltrsfu on snyivoshulsyion.
Therefore pt was intubated by anesthesia. Follow intubation
family elected to make pt DNR and then later that day decided on
comfort measures only. Pt was extubated and on [**2136-8-3**] pt
expired. Family denied autopsy.
.
.
3) thrombocytopenia- Heme onc consulted and attributed pt's
thrombocytopenia to pt's recent dose of samarium.
.
4) elev amylase/lipase- likely [**2-1**] ongoing vomiting, no clinical
evidence of pancreatitis.
