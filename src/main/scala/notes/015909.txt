Cath [**2114-10-22**]
1) Native vessels.
- Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA
with no signifiant lesion.
- The LAD was diffusely diseased with narrowing to 50% in the
proximal vessel and then serial 80-90% lesions in the mid and
distal vessel.
- The LCX was diffusely diseased with serial 90% lesions in the
proximal segment. The LCX supplied a large, bifurcating OM1 that
had diffuse luminal irregularities and a focal 80% lesion at the
bifurcation.
- The RCA was diffusely diseased with an 80% ostial narrowing
and serial 90% lesions in the proximal and mid vessel.
2) Grafts
- The SVG->LAD had 90% in-stent restenosis in the proximal
segment(cypher stent -> no residual stenosis) and
an 80% tubular stenosis in the distal graft just prior to the
touchdown (cypher stent -> negative 20% residual stenosis)
- The SVG->OM was known to be totally occluded.
3) Hemodynamics
- mean RA pressure of 13 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 17 mmHg.  The
cardiac output was severely reduced at 2.5 L/min with an SVR of
2592
dynes-sec/cm5. There was also evidence of pulmonary hypertension
with PA pressures of 72/23/40 mmHg and a PVR of 736
dynes-sec/cm5. Left
ventricular filling pressures were not obtained due to the
patient's
known LV clot.

Cath [**2114-10-23**]

1) Coronary arteries
-The LAD had severe proximal and midvessel disease with distal
competitive filling via the SVG-LAD. LCx as above cath [**10-22**].
- The RCA was not selectively engaged.
- The SVG-LAD had no angiographically apparent, flow-limiting
disease.

2) Resting hemodynamics revealed central hypertension with blood
pressure 170/82 mmHg. PA systolic pressures were elevated at 39
mmHg.
Mean PCWP was 11 mmHg. Cardiac index was 1.9 L/min/m2 by Fick.

3) Successful treatment of LCx with three overlapping Cypher
drug-eluting stents after rotational atherectomy. Final
angiography
demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection, and normal flow.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P
The pt is an elderly Cuban Woman w pmh of DM, CAD s/p MI and
CABG,who presents for coronary angiography due to + stress test
and continued symptoms of angina and chf.

1) CAD - Pt with h/o MI, s/p cabg and pci with 3 weeks of doe
and sob and +stress test revealing fixed inferior and lateral
wall perfusion defects and lv dilation.  Pt admitted for cath
[**2114-10-22**].  Pt's Creatinine was 1.5 on admission and pt received
mucomyst and bicarb hydration prior to cath on [**10-22**].  Pt also
had an echo done prior to cath, which showed a 2X1 cm thrombus
in LV.  At cath, LV cavity was not entered. Pt had 2 stents
placed in SVG->LAD graft.  Pt was transferred to ccu post cath
and was taken back to cath on [**10-23**] and had 3 stents placed in
LCx. Pt denied any CP, orthopnea or PND after the procedures.

2) CHF - Pt volume overloaded on exam, elevated jvp and
bibasilar crackles.  DOE may have been secondary to CAD vs. CHF.
 Pt was initially diuresed with IV lasix on the floor.  Echo
[**10-22**] was remarkable for global hypokinesis and a thrombus in LV
cavity.  Hemodynamics at cath on [**2114-10-22**] were PCW 18, PA 62/21,
CO (Fick) 2.43 and CI 1.63 at cath and pt transferred to CCU.

Pt required milrinone 0.28mcg/kg/min IV infusion and nesiritide
0.01mcg/kg/min.  During the cath on [**10-22**], SVG -> LAD stenosis
was opened with 2 cypher stents.  On [**10-23**] she underwent a
second cardiac cath where LCx lesions were stented open with 3
cypher stents.  Pt was gently diuresed -1L day one and -400 cc
day 2 in the ICU.  Pt was weaned off milronone and niseritide
and was transferred back to floor after 2 days in ccu.
Hemodynamics on cath [**10-23**], PA 45/20, PCW 11, CO 4.7, CI 3.1.

Post CCU pt was diuresesed with lasix on the floor.  She had
some SOB with exertion however denied CP, orthopnea and pnd.

3) CRI - Creatinine on admission 1.5.  The renal insuff on
presentation may have been a combination of CRI secondary to DM
as well as pt being prerenal due to severly depressed CO seen on
first PCI.  Creatinine 0.9 post cath [**10-23**], in setting of post
cath hydration.  Her creatinine was 1.2 on [**10-25**] which maybe
near her baseline creatinine.  ACEI was held since pt had
received 2 dye loads.  She should have Potassium and Creatinine
checked on [**10-26**].  And PCP can restart the ACEI when pt is seen
on monday [**10-29**].

4) LV thrombus - Pt with a 2X1 cm thrombus on Echo [**10-22**].
Consideration was given to oral coumadin anticoagulation as
outpt, in addition to asa and plavix.  After speaking with Dr.
[**Known lastname **], given pt's age and recent fall 3 weeks ago, plan is to
continue to anticoag with asa and plavix and hold off on
cou
