History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66402**] is a 73 yo male with a h/o CAD, CHF, severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], AICD, CKD and atrial fibrillation who presented to [**Hospital1 **]
with a complaint of feeling lightheaded. He was shocked at home
x1 on the day prior to presentation and was evaluated by his
Cardiologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**] who found him to have multiple episodes of
monomorpic VT which were stopped with ATP and defibrillation x
1. His Toprol was increased.
.
The following evening , patient experienced multiple episodes of
lightheadedness each lasting for seveal seconds. He reports
three syncopal episodes. The first episode occurred while
standing in the kitchen, and he fell and struck his head as a
result. A second episode occurred while in the seated position.
And the third episode occurred while in bed.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 **], he was started on an amiodarone drip
for management of recurrent episodes of VT. He had a
self-limited episode of VT, HR 160, in the [**Hospital1 **] ED. A CT
scan of his head was performed, which was negative for acute
bleed. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, or palpitations. He endorses intermittent
lightheadedness for approximately the past two weeks.

Echo ([**2135-9-10**]):  The atria are markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
10-15%). The estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. The transmitral gradient is normal
for this prosthesis (though may be underestimated given severe
LV dysfunction). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 73 yo male with h/o CAD, CHF, ICD who p/w VT
storm on [**9-9**],  s/p bedside pacer placement and requiring
intubation-- had guidant pacer in place; extubated, permanent
pacer with atrial sensing placed.
.
# Rhythm:  the patient was admitted initially for VT storm at an
outside hospital, was stable on a lidocaine drip with
intermittent VT in CCU.  Patient had a VT ablation, was deemed
there were too many foci to ablate all areas of automaticity,
though some foci were ablated.  On [**2135-9-9**], patient presented
with refractory VT storm, implanted ICD at the time was not
firing adequately, patient was internally shocked via pacer
interrogation over 6 times, VT was refractive.  Patient
restarted on lidocaine and amiodarone drips, femoral line was
placed, patient needed to have bedside pacer placement (atrial
sensor).  The patient was intubated and given fluids, required
external defibrillation that night.  The next day, the patient
was taken for a repeat VT ablation, femoral artery was lacerated
and required vascular surgery repair.  Decreased Hct required
frequent blood transfusions.  Patient was taken back to CCU, had
no episodes of VT, Hct was stable, was extubated, and a
permanent atrial sensing pacemaker was placed.  The patient was
placed on mexilitene and quinidine sulfate.
.
# Pump:  EF previously documented as 20% with LV dysfunction,
possibly with shocked heart after procedures, the patient was
continued a beta blocker and switched to Toprol XL.
.
# Valves:  Recent ECHO ([**2135-9-10**]) shows moderate MR, severe TR,
no interventions were done.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: No evidence of active ischemia, the patient had
continued his beta-blocker as tolerated, as well as his Zetia.
.
# Groin bleed s/p catheterization:  The patient had a decrease
in Hct which required blood transfusions, a subsequent CT pelvis
showed no RP bleed, Hct was stable before discharge, was given a
unit of blood prior to discharge solely because existing stable
Hct was lower than admission Hct.
.
# Renal insufficiency:  Pt. presented with cr at 2.2, now at
1.5, diuretics were held for most of stay, but half dose of home
lasix was restarted prior to discharge due to stable and
decreasing Cr.
.
# HTN: had been on metoprolol tartrate and then toprol XL prior
to discharge.
.
# DM: Pt complaining of fingersticks.  Regularly on glyburide,
placed on glyburide prior to discharge.
