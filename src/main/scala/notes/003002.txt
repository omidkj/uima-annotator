[**2143-6-29**]  10:08:50 AM Cardiovascular Report ECG
Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific ST segment changes in the
precordial leads and in the inferior leads. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2141-6-9**] the rate has increased and the
non-specific ST segment changes are new.

[**2143-6-29**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute
cardiopulmonary process.

[**2143-6-29**] 11:00 AM   # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76388**] CTA ABD & PELVIS and CHEST

1.  No evidence of acute aortic syndrome, no aortic dissection.

2.  Focal area of hypoenhancement and edema centered in the
pacreatic head and neck, consistent with acute pancreatitis.
Moderate amount of simple free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis
is new since [**2142-1-15**] exam and likely relates to underlying
panreatitis.  No pseudcyst formation or vascular complications
at this time.
3.  Coarse hepatic calcification is longstanding and likely
represents sequela of prior infection or trauma.
4.  Emphysema.
5.  Severe coronary artery calcifications.
6.  Post-surgical changes related to left axillary-bifemoral
graft.  Femoral arteries appear patent.  Persistent thrombosis
of the infrarenal aorta.

[**2143-6-30**] 9:02 AM   # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76389**]
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US-IMPRESSION: Sludge ball in the
gallbladder neck, but no evidence of acute cholecystitis on US.
Normal 5-mm CBD without evidence of obstruction.

[**2143-6-30**] 3:40 PM   # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76390**]   MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC)
MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC)-IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse signal abnormality involving the pancreas with
hypointensity on the T1 sequences and hyperintensity on the T2
sequences most consistent with diffuse pancreatitis.  A more
focal region of hypoenhancement involving the pancreatic neck is
suspicious for early necrosis.  If the clinical situation of the
patient worsens over the next few days/weeks, then a followup
MRCP examination may be obtained.
2. 1.2 cm pancreatic cyst.  A followup MRI may be obtained in
six months to ensure stability.
3. Gallstones.
4. No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation.

[**2143-7-8**]   Cardiovascular ECG
Sinus rhythm. Borderline prolonged Q-T interval. Compared to the
previous
tracing of [**2143-6-29**] the T waves in leads V2-V6 are taller. This
may represent acute ischemia or, more likely, an electrolyte
abnormality.

[**2143-7-8**]  CT ABD W&W/O C
IMPRESSION:
1.  New focus of gas within paripancreatic fluid anterior to the
pancreatic head is highly concerning for infection.  This
collection is not yet organized. No drainable collect
