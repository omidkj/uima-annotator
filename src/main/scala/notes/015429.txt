Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, shortness of breath

Arterial Line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 67176**] is a 58 year old man with ANCA-negative vasculitis
with a history of pulmonary hemorrhages, on chronic supplemental
oxygen, high dose prednisone therapy s/p recent admission
earlier this month ([**Date range (1) 67187**]) for perforated diverticular
disease managed conservatively with bowel rest and antibiotics,
now admitted with worsening weakness.

Patient reports that since he first received the Rituxan in
early [**Month (only) 404**], his weakness has worsened.  He feels tired all
the time, has no energy and decreased exercise tolerance.  He
can no longer walk from his wheelchair (motorized) to the
bathroom (a matter of a few steps) due to dyspnea.  He denies
fevers, chills, change in his cough or hemoptysis.  He has daily
hemoptysis that is no different from baseline.  He has had some
pain in his mouth that he attributes to thrush.  He started on
Nystatin swish and swallow a few days ago and that has helped
considerably.  His abdominal discomfort is much improved.  He is
tolerating a normal diet and taking in POs.  He has been on 6L
of oxygen for the past month or so, but adds a face mask with
additional oxygen when ambulating to the BR.  This is a
significant worsening for him per his report, in the not too
distant past, he reports, he could at times go without
supplemental oxygen.  He does not wear CPAP or BiPAP.

ROS is negative for chest pain, edema, rash, fevers/chills,
nausea, no urinary frequency or dysuria. Positive for: diarrhea
- loose stools since diverticulitis flare. Also with some
chronic visual changes limiting his ability to read easily.
Says he saw a ophthamologist for this and was told it was due to
ischemic damage.

Past Medical History:
Alveolar hemorrhage/anca negative vasculitis. Never had a
biopsy. presented as DAD in [**4-8**]. Several hospitalizations for
same since then.
Atrial fibrillation status post ablation.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
DVT with PE s/p filter [**7-8**]
CAD status post stenting to the LAD in [**2101**].
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Obesity.
Sleep apnea.
NASH.
Hyperlipidemia.
Hypertension.
Bilateral torn rotator cuff.
BPH.

REPORTS =============================================

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2112-2-2**]
1. Feculent collection adjacent to loop of sigmoid colon at site
of previous episode of diverticultis consistent with perforated
diverticulitis. This has progressed in size from the prior
examination and is localized to the perisigmoid region although
there is not a well defined wall about this gas and stool
containing collection.
2. Extensive colonic diverticulosis.
3. Paraumbilical hernia containing nonobstructed, nondilated
loops of small bowel.
4. Stable scarring at bilateral lung bases with fibrotic
changes.
5. Stable hypodensity in the pancreas, which could represent an
IMPN or
pancreatic cyst. MRCP would be recommended for further
evaluation.

 CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2112-2-28**]
1. Persistent diffuse ground-glass opacities superimposed on
interstitial
abnormality. As previously described, this may be due to
pulmonary
hemorrhage, exacerbation of underlying interstitial disease, or
infection. No pleural effusions.
2. No pulmonary embolus.
3. Sigmoid colon abscess drainage catheter in place. No
reaccumulation of
fluid or new abdominal collections.

 CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2112-3-11**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-10**], there are lower lung
volumes
and increasing pulmonary vascular congestion. The possibility of
supervening pneumonia must be considered. Monitoring and support
devices remain in place with the metallic portion of the
Dobbhoff tube just below the esophagogastric
junction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission the weekend of [**1-30**], patient's Cellcept and
Rituxan were halted. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed
enlarging sigmoid fluid collection consistent with an abscess.
Pulmonary, surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], ID and IR were all
consulted. Additional blood cultures were drawn and Zosyn
started. Surgery was felt to be high-risk given his 450
mg-per-day Prednisone dosing. A plan was made for IR drainage of
the fluid collection after a platelet transfusion -- after a
platelet transfusion for his thrombocytopenia -- while
simultaneous
