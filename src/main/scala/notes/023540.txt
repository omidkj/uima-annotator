Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old male with
cardiac risk factors of gender, hypercholesterolemia, and
tobacco use, who presented to [**Hospital3 3834**] after
experiencing three days of chest pain prior to admission.  He
described it as substernal pressure, which felt like
heartburn.  He denied nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations.  He
seemed to improve with activity.  He admitted to nocturnal
awakening, though no shortness of breath.  He states he had a
similar episode approximately 20 years ago which resolved
with a H2 blocker.  He had syncope approximately 15 years
ago, felt flushed.  Approximately six weeks ago, he felt
lightheaded without syncope.  He denies PND or orthopnea.

At presentation to the [**Hospital3 3834**], his blood pressure
was decreased to the 80s to 90s with nitroglycerin.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac
catheterization.  Catheterization demonstrated right dominant
system, 30% left circumflex, total occlusion of the right
coronary artery and mid region which was Angio-Jetted and
then stented with 2.75 x 32 mm and 3.0 x 15 mm stents.  There
were distal emboli in the PDA and RPL.  A left ventriculogram
revealed mitral regurgitation, pulmonary capillary wedge of
19, P.A. of 13/12, RV of 42/5, RA of 13, cardiac output of
4.76, cardiac index of 2.21.  His case was complicated by
decreased breath sounds requiring dopamine drip.  He was
transferred to the CCU with an Aggrastat drip.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Night sweats on the end of [**2162-11-10**], negative for fevers, positive for chills at that time.
Denies amaurosis fugax.  Denies dysarthria or asymmetric
weakness.  Positive cough, nonproductive, no melena, no
bright red blood per rectum, no hematuria.  Negative for poor
healing.  Positive claudication.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON PRESENTATION TO THE CCU:  Heart rate 90
regular, blood pressure 91/54 on dopa 5 mcg/kg.  Sating 98%
on 2 liters, respiratory rate 16, 98 kg.  He was lying
supine, breathing comfortably.  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive bilaterally.  Extraocular muscles are intact.
Oropharynx is clear and dry.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention while supine.  Lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular, rate,
and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no S3, S4, or murmur.  Abdomen:
No pulsatile mass, negative hepatomegaly, nontender.
Extremities:  DP decreased on the right, trace DP and PT
pulses on the left 1+, no edema, clubbing.  Right groin with
a 5 French arterial line.  Left groin with a 6 French
arterial sheath.  Neurologic:  No facial droop.  Tongue
midline.  Palate upgoing symmetrically.  Moves all four
extremities symmetrically.

Electrocardiogram at 8 am:  AVR with ST elevation of 4 mm.
At 9:50 am, he was sinus at 86 beats per minute, PR 140, QRS
92, QTC at 44, normal axis, 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in II, III,
and aVF, III greater than II, ST depressions in I and aVL.

LABORATORIES:  White count 11.8, hematocrit 37.5, platelets
111, MCV of 88, neutrophils 84%, bands 4, lymphocytes 7, INR
of 1, PTT of 21, PT of 11.7.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.1,
chloride of 105, bicarb 21, BUN 13, creatinine 1.6, glucose
of 126, calcium of 8, albumin of 3.5, bilirubin of 0.9, and
alkaline phosphatase 74, ALT of 84, AST of 250, CK of 1493,
CK MB of 135, index of 9.1, troponin-I of 28.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 48-year-old gentleman with
inferior myocardial infarction admitted to the CCU on Dopa
drip due to hypotension status post RCA Angio-Jet and stent
x2.  There is a concern that he had right ventricular
involvement because of the hypotension post nitroglycerin at
the outside hospital.  The patient was continued on Aggrastat
for about 18 hours.  He was continued on aspirin, Plavix,
Lipitor, and he was counseled on smoking cessation given a
nicotine patch.  The enzymes were continued and cycled until
a downward trend.

A beta blocker was held initially due to the hypertension.
During catheterization laboratory, the patient was also noted
to have VT.  He was not shocked.  His electrolytes were
monitored closely, there were no further episodes.  Patient
was also on a proton-pump inhibitor.

The day of admission the patient was initiated on low dose
beta blocker.  The following day he was started on a low dose
ACE inhibitor.  The dopamine came off the day after admission
as well, and he had no difficulty maintaining pressure.
Patient was .............. that day.

Postcatheterization course was complicated by a temperature
of 101.3, as well as decreased platelets.  A HIT antibody was
sent which was negative.  Due to the cough and the fever, the
patient was initiated on levofloxacin.  Patient also had
diarrhea at that time.  Clostridium difficile was sent since
he had been on antibiotics previously.  Stool, sputum, and
blood cultures, as well as urine cultures all remained
negative, and the patient remained afebrile after that one
event.

Patient continued to do well, and stated that he would
followup closely with his PCP due to the fever with unknown
source.  The patient was discharged status post inferior
myocardial infarction, status post right coronary artery
stent x2.  Patient was scheduled to followup with PCP.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to
followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] of Cardiology and his PCP both within
one week of discharge.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  He was instructed to continue to
take his temperature q day, and if he should have any
symptoms of chills or night sweats.

PROCEDURES:  Cardiac catheterization with stent of totally
occluded right coronary artery x2 stents.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved and stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg q day.
2. Plavix 75 mg q day x9 months.
3. Atorvastatin 20 mg q day.
4. Nicotine patch.
5. Carvedilol 3.125 [**Hospital1 **].
6. Lisinopril 5 q day.
7. Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg sublingual prn.
