CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2103-3-9**] 5:45 PM
Endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet. The cuff appears
slightly overinflated. Internal jugular central venous line is
new and contains a Swan- Ganz catheter, the tip of which is
within the right pulmonary artery. The patient is status post
CABG. The left-sided PICC is in stable position. Again, noted
are patchy bilateral parenchymal opacities, overall unchanged
allowing for differences in technique. There is a moderate sized
right effusion and a small left effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory failure: Hypoxic resp failure thought most likely
secondary to multifocal/ ? aspiration PNA (given valium). Recent
CCU admission so may be nosocomial, and patient was started on
levofloxacin/Flagyl/CTX/vancomycin.  Over hospital course,
patient was in addition thought to be in volume overload with a
component of CHF given h/o CAD, and diuresis was attempted with
success, however limited by hypotension as below.

Further, patient continued throughout MICU course to fail any
attempts to wean ventilation, and tracheostomy was offered.
Patient declined tracheostomy and requested extubation and
withdrawal of care.

2. Hypotension: Likely [**3-7**] combination of hypovolemia and sepsis
and patient was treated with Dopamine infusion.  Also thought to
be exacerbated by afib and lack of atrial kick.

3. Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient was continued on amiodarone,
which was not felt to contribute to patient's pulmonary issues.
However, patient was noted to be hypotensive when in atrial
fibrillation.

4. CAD: Cont. Statin. Hold ASA given increased INR. Currently in
SR. Will cont. amio change to 200 qd as long QTc. cycle enzymes
(trending down Tnt 0.16).

5. CHF: total body volume overloaded but intravascularly dry.
CVP was elevated following line placement and objective numbers
attained (~[**12-15**]), and patient responded to diuresis, however,
pressures also fell accordingly as above.

On hospital day 7, patient indicated to MICU team and family
that he wished to have care withdrawn and to be extubated.  On
hospital day 8, patient was extubated and given comfort measures
only.  He expired shortly following extubation with family at
bedside.
