HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old man
transferred via [**Location (un) **] from an outside hospital,
[**Hospital1 **], in respiratory distress, at the time
intubated on dopamine, diltiazem and nitroglycerin infusions.
 By report he had been at home gardening during the day when
he developed chest pain and shortness of breath which became
worse in the evening.  He initially felt the symptoms were
due to asthma and then presented to [**Hospital1 **] around
3 AM for evaluation when his symptoms did not resolve.  At
[**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] he was initially treated with IV Lasix and
nitroglycerin as well as bronchodilators.  At that time he
became hypotensive and unresponsive with hypoxia.  He was
treated with diltiazem and dopamine drips as well as
intubated.  His potassium level at that time was 2.7 which
was repleted.  He was then transported via [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 1444**] and evaluated in the
emergency room.

Status post right pleural effusion drainage about two years
ago.  4. Hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission his vital signs were
heart rate 76 and regular, blood pressure 104/49 on 5 mcg per
kg per minute of dopamine, ventilated at a rate of 12, O2
saturation 99% on 100% FIO2.  Temperature was 98.8.  In

BUN 27, creatinine 1.3, glucose 402.  CK was 557.  Blood gas:
7.32, CO2 46, PO2 84 on assist control at 750 with a rate of
12 and 100% FIO2.

EKG:  Sinus tachycardia with diffuse ST depressions.

Echocardiogram:  Depressed left ventricular function less
than 30%, apical akinesis and inferior hypokinesis.

He was seen by cardiology in the emergency room and brought
immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.
Please see the catheterization laboratory report for full
details.  In summary, at catheterization the patient was
found to have left main 60%, left anterior descending
coronary artery 80%, left circumflex coronary artery 70%,
right coronary artery 90%.  An intra-aortic balloon pump was
placed at that time and cardiac surgery was consulted.  The
patient was seen by the cardiac surgery service and accepted
for coronary artery bypass grafting.

On [**2194-4-4**] the patient was brought to the operating room.
Please see the operative report for full details.  In
summary, the patient had coronary artery bypass grafting x 3
with a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal #1, and saphenous vein graft to the PL.  He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
Once in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit the patient
was kept sedated and ventilated.  He remained hemodynamically
stable on Neo-Synephrine and milrinone infusions.

On postoperative day one the patient was weaned from his
milrinone infusion.  Following that he was weaned from his
intra-aortic balloon pump which was discontinued later in the
day.  After removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the
patient's sedation was discontinued.  He was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.

On postoperative day two the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  His chest tubes and central venous access lines were
all discontinued and he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 for
continued postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Once on the floor the patient was noted to be complaining of
nausea without any vomiting.  His abdomen was soft and
nontender.  KUB done at that time showed distended loops of
bowel.  He was made n.p.o. and treated with intravenous
fluids as well as antiemetics and Reglan.  His liver function
tests were checked and they were all within normal limits.  A
nasogastric tube was placed on the second day following an
additional KUB which showed continuing bowel distention.  In
addition, the patient had a consultation from the [**Hospital **]
Clinic for control of his hyperglycemia.  Over the next few
days the patient's bowel distention slowly resolved.  On
postoperative day eight the patient's bowel distention had
begun to clear.  He had less complaints of nausea.  His
nasogastric tube was clamped at that time.  He tolerated this
well and later in the day his nasogastric tube was removed.
Over the next several days the patient's activity level was
increased with the assistance of the nursing staff and
physical therapist.

On postoperative day 12 it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be discharged to home.  At the time of
discharge the patient's physical examination showed him to be
afebrile with vital signs stable.  He was alert and oriented
x 3.  He moved all extremities.  Breath sounds were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart sounds were regular rate and
rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmur noted.  Sternal incision was
clean, dry and intact with staples in place, no purulence or
erythema.  Abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended with
active bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm and dry with
minimal peripheral edema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.
2. Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. x seven days.
3. Potassium chloride 40 mEq b.i.d. x 7 days.

1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
grafting x 3.

3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Asthma.
