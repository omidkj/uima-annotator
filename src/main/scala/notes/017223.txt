Date of Birth:  [**2051-7-8**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NSU


PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Subdural hemorrhage.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 57655**] is a 66-year-old woman
who was transferred to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18488**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital on [**2117-12-5**].  She reportedly had a fall at home down six steps.
She arose from her fall and went to lay down in bed -
apparently responsive and alert at the time.  She was woken
up several hours later by her family members and was noted to
be more somnolent and lethargic.  At the time she was alert,
oriented, and interactive still.

She was transferred to an outside hospital ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18488**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])
where she underwent a computer tomography scan showing a
substantial parafalcine subdural hemorrhage predominantly in
the left with some small contusions in the frontoparietal
area.  She was subsequently intubated for transport and sent
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She was noted to have a history of
diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and asthma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Upon examination at
the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital, she was moving her left
extremely and localizing to stimulation, had some minimal
movement of her right extremity.  She was not awake or alert.
She was not following any commands.  She had a positive gag
reflex and reactive pupils as well as corneal reflexes.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was managed medically after
a discussion with the family.  An arterial line was placed.
Mannitol was started as well as Dilantin.  A repeat computer
tomography scan was done showing blossoming of the left
frontoparietal contusion with a stable subdural.

Her course in the hospital had otherwise remained uneventful.
She was noted to have a right humeral fracture as well.  She
was seen by Orthopaedics, and no surgical intervention was
warranted at the time.

Ultimately, she was transferred to the Neurosurgery Service.
Her examination remained unchanged.  She had some increased
swelling over the contusion.  She became less responsive and
moved her left slightly less.  Ultimately, a family
discussion into withdrawal of care was agreed upon.  Given
her poor prognosis and unlikely recovery, she was made
comfort measures only.

On [**2117-12-18**] she passed away and was pronounced at
5:02 p.m.
