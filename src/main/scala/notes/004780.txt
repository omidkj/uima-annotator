Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
60-year old woman with a history of CAD s/p IMI, CHF s/p AICD,
SLE, scleroderma, severe pulmonary HTN, COPD on home O2 2 L NC,
recent R hip fracture after fall s/p R ORIF and MICU stay for
hypotension and difficulty with extubation who now has been
transferred back to the hospital from rehab and admitted for
respiratory distress.

On [**2167-10-1**], patient was admitted to an OSH for C. diff
pancolitis and discharged on PO Vancomycin. On [**2167-10-6**] at home,
she tripped and fell off 2 stairs. She was taken to OSH, where
she was found to have a displaced intertrochanteric hip fracture
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Although operative risk was high
given multiple comorbidities, she underwent R ORIF on day of
transfer.  There were no complications during surgery. After
extubation, she required non-rebreather and subsequently became
hypotensive requiring pressors for 48 hours. She was transferred
to MICU and reintubated. She was initially treated with
Cefepime, Vancomycin, and Levaquin in addition to IV Flagyl and
PO Vancomycin for C. diff. Her cultures only showed a UTI and
her antibiotics were tapered down to Cipro in addition to PO
vanc for C. diff. She was restarted on her home pulm HTN
medications sildenfil and bosentan. Pt was extubated [**10-13**], was
initially tachypneic and improved after gentle diuresis. She was
also restarted on BB that was titrated up for MAT vs. Afib.  She
was discharged to rehab on [**2167-10-16**].

On [**2167-10-17**] at the rehab, the patient was noted to be hypoxic,
satting 84% on 2L. She had denied SOB and had a nonproductive
cough. Of note, she did have a bedside evaluation and aspirated
on jello. On 5L O2, O2 sat was 93-94% post-nebulizer treatment.
ABG was 7.47/34/57. She was then noted to be tachycardic to 120.
She was given Lasix 20 mg IV and put on 1200 cc. She was also
spiked a fever to 101.7 and was given Vanco and Cefepime.
Patient was brought to the ED for re-evaluation.

In the ED, initial vital signs were: 99.6, 132, 157/96, 36, 95.
Tmax 104.8. Exam was [**Date Range 65**]. for erythematous RUE and RLE. PICC
site was evaluated by IV team and felt to be bruised but clean.
CTA chest shows singular small PE at LLL ant basal segment
branch point, left pleural effusion, & bibasal atelectasis. She
was also noted to have nodular consolidation and fluid in
trachea and esophagus susp for aspiration pneumonitis. Pt was
started on heparin gtt. CT abd was benign. Patient received 125
mg solumedrol. Tachypnea improved with nebs. Her troponin
increased to 0.11. She has an aspirin allergy. Cardiology was
consulted and recommended plavix if her troponin increases
again. Pt also received toradol 30 mg IV and morphine 4 mg for
pain. She had 1L NS. VS on transfer: BP 127/61, HR 117, RR 31,
O2 sat 100% on 10L by NC.

response to vasodilator therapy, no response, PAP 100mm Hg,
Cardiac Index 2L/min
- R-sided heart failure: ECHO in [**10-9**] shows dilated,
hypertrophied, and markedly hypokinetic right ventricle.

osteomyelitis

CXR [**10-17**]: R PICC line. Cardiomegaly. Mild perihilar fullness,
slightly worsened than [**10-16**]. L pleural effusion.

CTA chest/abd [**10-17**]: 1. Singular small pulmonary embolus in the
pulmonay subsegmental artery to the left anterobasal segment.
2. Right lower lobe nodular opacities peripherally together with
fluid in the esophagus and trachea suggest aspiration
pneumonitis.
3. Upper normal diameter of pulmonary artery, together with
biventricular and biatrial enlargement are more suggestive of a
chronic elevated right heart pressure than acute right heart
strain.

CXR [**10-24**]: The right PICC line tip is at the level of low SVC.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The pacemaker leads terminate
in right atrium and right ventricle. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged including cardiomegaly. Pulmonary artery
dilatation that is known based on the recent CT of the torso is
redemonstrated. Bibasal opacities consistent with known
interstitial changes appear to be slightly more prominent on the
current study. Thus superimposed acute on chronic process cannot
be excluded and should be closely followed. The upper lungs are
clear. There is no interval development of pleural effusion and
there is no pneumothorax.

CXR [**2167-11-1**]: Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and there is
persistent
enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries. Patchy opacities
have
developed at both bases predominantly in the retrocardiac
regions, and could be due to clinically suspected aspiration.
Small pleural effusions are also demonstrated. Minimal basilar
interstitial abnormality, which could reflect interstitial edema
or chronic scarring/fibrosis in the setting of scleroderma.

Right femur [**10-17**]: Expected postop appearance. No subcutaneous
air.
[**10-21**] hip 2 view: Status post ORIF right intertrochanteric
fracture, in overall anatomic alignment.

Right upper extremity ultrasound [**10-18**]: No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence
of right upper extremity DVT. Non-visualization of one of the
two paired brachial veins, which cannot be evaluated for DVT,
although there are no findings to suggest DVT.

Video swallow evaluation [**10-23**]
 Video oropharyngeal swallow evaluation was performed in
collaboration with the speech and swallow specialist. There are
moderate oral phase deficits including free spill of all liquids
to the pharynx. There are mild pharyngeal deficits including
