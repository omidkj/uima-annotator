Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Cardiac catherization [**2130-5-20**]


History of Present Illness:
80 year old man with no history of CAD presented to the ER with
chest pain beginning one night ago.  Patient had no SOB or
diaphoresis.  Vitals on admission bp 130/70, hr 50, rr 16, 02sat
98%RA.  EKG showed ST elevation in V1-V3, ST depression in avL,
III, and III.  Patient received aspirin, plavix, heparin gtt,
and integellin gtt.  Metoprolol was held secondary to low HR.
CODE STEMI was called and patient taken emergently to the
cardiac cath lab.
In the cath lab hemodynamics revealed elevated L and R filling
pressures with depressed C.I. and moderate pulmonary
hypertension despite IABP placement.  CT surgery was notified.
Angiography revealed severe 3-vessel disease.  Upon arrival in
the CCU, the femoral arterial sheath was pulled however, the
patient had coffee ground emesis.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, DVT/PE, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools, or red stools.  He
denied recent fevers, chills, or rigors.  He denied exertional
buttock or calf pain.  All of the other review of systems were
negative.

On further discussion the patinet did state that he had had some
chest pain in the the first of [**Month (only) 958**] and then again in [**Month (only) 116**].  He
had seen his primary care doctor and was told to schedule a
stress test, but the patient was "too busy." He does not
complain of shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea,
or edema.

Past Medical History:
Hyperlipidemia
Retinitis Pigmentosa - legally blind
Hearing impairment - bilateral cochlear implants (right not yet
activated)

30+ year history of pipe smoking. no EtOH use. patient currently
lives alone in [**Location (un) 745**], MA.  He has 3 daughters.

cardiac cath [**2130-5-20**]: (see report for full details)
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock requiring IABP and dopamine gtt.
4. Acute anterior wall myocardial infarction managed by
attempted ptca
of the Left anterior descending artery.

TTE [**2130-5-20**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the septum and anterior walls,
distal inferior wall and hypokinesis of the distal lateral wall.
The apex is aneurysmal and dyskinetic. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 25-30 %). No thrombus is seen, but
images are suboptimal to exclude. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened but severe aortic valve stenosis is not
suggested. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD (prox/mid LAD lesion).

EGD [**2130-5-20**] - Esophagitis. Blood in the fundus. Duodenitis.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
Found to have STEMI and had cardiac catheterization. Found to
have 3 vessel disease as mentioned in cath report. Likely an old
LAD infarct with angina related to Lcx. IABP placed and Pt
transferred to CCU on dopamine drip.
GI team did endoscopy today before heparin was restarted after
the catheteriztion. Showed esophagitis. Started protonix drip
and sulcrafate slushies. Heparin restarted for IABP.
He was taken to the operating room on [**5-23**] where he underwent an
off pump CABG x 4. He was transferred to the ICU in stable
condition on dopamine, propofol and neo. Cardioversion was
attempted for atrial fibrillation but he remained in a fib and
was started on amiodarone. IABP was dc'd on POD #1. He was
extubated on POD #2. Pressors were weaned to off on POD #2. He
remained in the ICU for aggressive pulmonary toilet and
monitoring. He was transfused. He slowly improved. He was
transferred to the floor on POD #8. He continued to progress
with no further atrial fibrillation and was being weaned from
oxygen.  He was ready for discharge to rehab on POD 10 with plan
to continue pulmonary exercises and wean oxygen for saturation
greater than 92%.
