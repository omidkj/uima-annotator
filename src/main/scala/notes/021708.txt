Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Chronic mesenteric ischemia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right common iliac to superior mesenteric artery bypass with
6-mm PTFE graft and reimplantation of inferior mesenteric artery
into infrarenal abdominal aorta.


History of Present Illness:
This 62-year-old lady has previously had a celiac angioplasty
and stent about 5 or 6 years ago for chronic mesenteric
ischemia. This has occluded. She recently
underwent an arteriogram. This showed her celiac artery to be
chronically occluded including the stent. Her proximal superior
mesenteric artery was totally occluded over a long segment. The
inferior mesenteric artery had a 90% stenosis at its origin and
there was a very large meandering mesenteric
artery reconstituting the superior mesenteric artery at the
takeoff of a replaced right hepatic artery.

Reason: pna?

Pulmonary edema has improved since [**2-17**], but there is still
a severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality that suggests a
combination of residual edema and a widespread infiltrative
process unrelated to cardiac decompensation. Interstitial
pneumonia, drug reaction, or chronic interstitial lung disease
are possibilities. The heart size is top normal. Pleural
effusion, if any, is small, on the right. Tip of the right
jugular line projects over the low SVC. Vascular stent and skin
staples noted in the upper abdomen.

INTERPRETATION:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function  (LVEF>55%).

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal; mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior
- normal; mid inferior - normal;  basal inferolateral - normal;
mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral  - normal; mid
anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Normal  descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. No MS. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: No TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal  (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal.  There are simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the  descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally  normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral  valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.  There is no pericardial
effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 70202**] was admitted on [**2113-2-13**] for an elective Right
common iliac to superior mesenteric artery bypass with 6-mm PTFE
graft and reimplantation of inferior
mesenteric artery into infrarenal abdominal
aorta.Pre-operatively, she was consented, prepped, and brought
down to the operating room for surgery. Intra-operatively, she
was closely monitored and remained hemodynamically stable. She
tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or
complication.

Post-operatively, she was extubated and transferred to the PACU
for further stabilization and monitoring. She was then
transferred to the floor for further recovery.

On the floor, she remained hemodynamically stable with her pain
controlled. She did develop an acute onset of SOB. Stat CXR
showed Pulmonary edema VS ARDS. She was transfered to the SICU.
While in the SICU she recieved aggressive pulmonary toilet.
After she was stabalized she was transfered back to the floor.

While on the floor she was gradually weaned from he O2.

She progressed with physical therapy to improve her strength and
mobility. She continues to make steady progress without any
incidents. She was discharged home with services.

Introduction:

Like your other organs, the organs in your digestive system need
a constant supply of oxygen-[**Doctor First Name **] blood to function properly. A
diminished blood flow to your small intestine or colon is
referred to as intestinal ischemia (is-KE-me-uh).

Intestinal ischemia can cause pain and make it difficult for
your intestines to do their job. In severe cases, loss of blood
flow to the intestines can lead to damaged or dead intestinal
tissue, not unlike what happens to the heart during a heart
attack.

Intestinal ischemia may develop suddenly (acute intestinal
ischemia), often as a result of a blood clot blocking the flow
of blood to or from the intestines, or it may develop gradually
over time (chronic intestinal ischemia), due to a variety of
causes.

Undetected and untreated, intestinal ischemia may be fatal. This
condition, though uncommon, is serious and often requires
immediate medical care. Depending on the cause of your
intestinal ischemia, treatment options may include medications,
surgery or a procedure to open your
