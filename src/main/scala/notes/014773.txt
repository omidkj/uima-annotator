Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Aortic Aneurysm


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2196-7-27**]
1. Replacement of ascending aorta and hemiarch using a 28-
    mm Dacron tube graft and deep hypothermic circulatory
    arrest.  The graft data is the following.  It is a
    Vascutek Gelweave graft, catalog number [**Numeric Identifier 31950**], lot
    number [**Telephone/Fax (3) 89446**], serial number [**Serial Number 89447**].
2. CorMatrix reconstruction of the pericardium.
3. Epiaortic duplex scanning.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old female well
known to our service who first presented in [**2196-3-8**] with
diagnosis of ascending aortic aneurysm. Aneurysm repair was
delayed at that time due to a colovesicular fistula causing
chronic urinary tract infections. In [**2196-4-8**] she underwent
placement of left-sided ureteral stent, sigmoid colectomy,
takedown of colovesicular fistula, mobilization of splenic
flexure and diverting loop ileostomy. In [**2196-5-8**] she underwent
successful ileostomy takedown. She is now recovering nicely from
surgery without recurrent urinary tract infections, and presents
again for surgical evaluation. Currently, she remains very
functional and denies chest and back pain, dyspnea on exertion,
orthopnea, PND, palpitations, pedal edema, and cough.

Pertinent Results:
[**2196-7-27**]
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is severely dilated.
The sinotubular junction is intact without effacement. The
descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:

1. Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function
2. Unchanged valvular structure and function
3. Tube graft visualized in ascending aortic position.
4. Intact descending thoracic aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2196-7-27**] where
the patient underwent ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement.
 Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
She returned to the CVICU overnight for hypotension and
oliguria.  This improved with hydration, and she returned to the
telemetry floor.  Cipro was started for positive urinalysis,
urine culture returned negative and antibiotics were
discontinued.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
