Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
55 yo F with breast cancer, HTN, DM2, presents with dyspnea on
exertion, orthpnea, and lower extremity edema.

She says her symptoms started 2 weeks ago, even before her
breast surgery, which was on [**2200-6-4**]. At that time, she
underwent left needle-localized lumpectomy, sentinel node
biopsy, and low axillary dissection. During the last couple of
weeks, her dyspnea has worsened. It is worse with exertion and
with lying flat. She has also noticed lightheadedness and has
needed to steady herself when walking. She has had a cough,
productive of yellow sputum. No hemoptysis. +bilateral ankle
swelling.

Due to wheezing, she was treated with albuterol as an
outpatient, but that did not seem to help. The symptoms became
worse over the past couple of days, leading the patient to
present to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: T 98.0 BP 103/73 HR 112 RR 16 Sat
97%/RA. Bedside ultrasound showed significant bilateral pleural
effusion without pericardial effusion. The patient was given
levofloxacin and vancomycin due to concern for infection.
Subsequently CTA showed PE. She was guaiac negative, but head CT
showed an abnormality for which the differential included
subarachnoid hemorrhage, so heparin was not started. The patient
was given 500 cc of normal saline. On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
vital signs were 97.5 120 24 128/75 100%/2L.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient stated that her breathing
was improved.

IMAGING:
# [**2200-6-13**] CXRay:
IMPRESSION:  Bilateral moderate pleural effusions with adjacent
bibasilar
atelectasis and mild pulmonary congestion.  Pneumonia cannot be
entirely
excluded in the right clinical setting.

# [**2200-6-13**] CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Left lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism without
evidence of right
heart strain or pulmonary infarction.
2.  Interlobular septal thickening is concerning for fluid
overload.  Given the lack of nodularity, carcinomatosis seems
much less likely, but is hard to completely excluded.
3.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right
than the left. In conjunction with the septal thickening, these
are most likely secondary to fluid overload from CHF, although
malignant effusions cannot be completely excluded.
4.  Bibasilar consolidations are likely atelectasis, although in
the proper clinical setting, infection cannot be excluded.
5.  Subcutaneous air in the left breast, possibly extending to
the skin.
These are likely postoperative changes.  Recommend clinical
correlation,
however, with direct inspection of the operative site.
6.  Left axillary seroma.
7.  Trace pericardial effusion.
