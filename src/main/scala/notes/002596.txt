chronic diarrhea on immodium. Over the last 2 months he has
noted increased urgency of stooling but no clear change in
amount/freqency or consistancy, no black stool or blood in
stool. He did have occasional nausea but no vomiting or
abdominal pain. In this same time period he began to feel weak
and fell in the bathtub. At that time he initiated outpt PT.
Over the last week had increasing fatigue and malaise with LOA
and a 10 lb wt loss.  He was found by PT to be hypotensive with
a BP 85/60 and lethargy w SOB. Sent to ED for evaluation. In ED

no clear coffee grounds, +congestion
In the ED on [**2168-1-18**], he was found to have on EGD a non-bleeding
large duodenal ulcer which was not cauterized at the time.
Instead, the patient was transfused as needed and his
hematocrits were followed serially.

On [**2168-1-21**], the patient was transferred to the MICU after having
large amounts of melanotic stool with a BP of 85/60. There, he
underwent repeat EGD where his duodenal bulb was cauterized and
he was transfused 1 unit PRBC although his Hct remained stable
above 30. On [**2168-1-22**], the patient was transferred back to the
floor as he was hemodynamically stable with a stable hematocrit.
