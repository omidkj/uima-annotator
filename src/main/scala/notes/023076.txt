epigastric abd pain / nausea / vomiting

History of Present Illness:
Mr. M.W. is a 78 yo man with a h/o of atrial fibrillation on
coumadin and amiodarone, CHF, s/p cholecystectomy in [**2117**] who
presents with 1 d of severe epigastric abdominal pain, nausea,
and vomiting.  Last night, five hours after eating
??????questionable?????? Chinese food, he began experiencing progressive
epigastric pain, coming in waves.  Eventually, the pain was
severe, [**10-14**], which felt like ??????wringing of his intestines,
spasms.??????  He noted that he had similar pain (though not as
severe) before his cholecystectomy, and that this pain was much
more severe than prior episodes of heartburn.  The pain did not
radiate, and was not relieved with TUMS, gas pills, or anything
else he tried.  The pain was so severe that he  ??????would??????ve taken
a black [poison] pill.??????  It was associated with nausea, dry
heaves, and cold sweats.  He had no fever, no CP / SOB, though
he noted that he had been having sparse BMs over the past [**2-6**] d.
 No melena / hematochezia / diarrhea / constipation.
	When he presented to the [**Hospital 7188**] Hospital ED, his vital signs
were noted to be 116/69, 68, 20, 95% on RA.  He received
hydromorphone 2 mg IV x2, which relieved his pain to [**4-14**]
severity.

On Discharge the patient's abdomen was soft and nontender, with
a well healing midline abdominal incision


Pertinent Results:
Abdominal Xray [**2131-9-10**]:
There are a few mildly gas distended loops of small bowel with
scattered small air fluid levels with gas and fecal residue
present throughout the colon. There is a large air fluid level
in the upper abdomen in the upright film likely within a
distended stomach but the upper abdomen is not included on the
supine view. No free gas under right diaphragm. Calcification in
aorta.
Lumbar scoliosis.

IMPRESSION: Few scattered air fluid levels in small bowel but no
evidence for definite intestinal obstruction. Probable marked
gastric distention. Correlate clinically and with repeat films
to include upper abdomen and/or CT if indicated.

CT abdomen [**2131-9-11**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Early vs. partial small bowel obstruction with transition
point in the ileum. Free fluid within the abdomen was present
and likely secondary to the small bowel obstruction. No evidence
of perforation.

2. Normal appearing pancreas.

CT abdomen [**2131-9-11**]:
IMPRESSION: No passage of contrast since the previous study six
hours earlier. A well defined transition point remains in the
right lower mid quadrant. There is a similar amount of air seen
within the large bowel however, and there is no change to the
amount of intraabdominal free fluid. Findings are consistent
with mechanical obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
	When he presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2131-9-10**], his vital signs
were noted to be 96.5, 160/110, 70, 18, 98% on RA.  He began
receiving IV fluids (1000 ml NS) and some addtl hydromorphone.
He was admitted to the medicine service, and a surgery consult
was obtained.  He was NPO and was receiving IV fluids.
Abdominal xray and CT suggested a diagnosis of a small bowel
obstruction.  The patient was distended and, his exam remained
unchanged, however a NG tube decompression helped relieve the
symptoms partially.  A repeat CT 6 hours after the initial scan
failed to demonstrate passage of contrast beyond the transition
point, and a decision was made to bring the patient to the
operating room for an exploratory laparotomy with lysis of
adhesions. His coags were reversed and the patient was brought
to the operating room.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, and postoperatively
the patient was admitted to the surgical service.  He was
admitted to the surgical intensive care unit for hemodynamic
monitoring and continued ventilator support.  He was continued
on antibiotics (ampicillin/Levo/Flagyl) which continued for a 1
week course.  He was started on TPN.  He was actively
resuscitated in the intensive care unit, and his vent was weaned
on postoperative day 1, and the patient was transferred to the
floor in stable condition on post operative day 2.  The patient
had some increased work of breathing on post operative day 2,
that was responsive to lasix and nebulizer treatments.  The
patient had some confusion and required a sitter for 2 days, but
this resolved spontaneously.  The patient had an uneventful
hospital course while we awaited the return of bowel function.
Physical therapy evaluated the patient and felt the patient was
an excellent candidate for rehab.  On post operative day 6 the
patient had 2 large bowel movements, the NG tube was
discontinued and the patient was started on sips of clear
liquids.  On post operative day 7 the patient was tolerating a
regular diet, was restarted on all of his home meds, he remained
hemodynamically stable, and had a therapeutic INR of 2.4.  The
patient was prepared for discharge to a rehab facility.

Prior to discharge the patient had an ultrasound of his right
upper extremity for some slight upper extremity swelling, which
revealed no clot in the arm veins, but did demonstrate a small
clot in his internal jugular, although flow through was patent.
Given that the patient was therapeutic on his coumadin, the
patient should have a repeat ultrasound in 2 weeks, continue his
coumadin, and the primary care physician was informed
