Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation by Electrophysiology.


History of Present Illness:
42 yo M with h/o CAD, MI at age 20, s/p CABG and PCI, ischemic
cardiomyopathy with EF of 30% s/p [**Hospital 26418**] transferred from [**Hospital 6451**] with slow VT (120s). Patient has had a 1-1.5 month
history of intermittent episodes of chest pressure and left
sided sharp chest pain that radiates to the left arm. He had
associated diaphoresis, n/v, without SOB. On the day of
admission to [**Hospital3 **] ([**2147-5-20**]) he woke up with 6/10 sharp
L-sided chest pain radiating to the left arm and other symptoms
as described above. He could not get off of the couch for an
hour and was scared so he called EMS. He said these episodes
were similar to episodic VT episodes he had in the past. Of
note, they are different from his Anginal pain and MI symptoms
in the past which were substernal chest pressure with numbness
down the whole left side of his body and sever diaphoresis. He
presented to [**Hospital3 **] where he was initially started on
lidocaine drip and also received IV amiodarone. Cardiac enzymes
were flat. While on telemetry at [**Hospital3 **] the patient was noted
to have multiple episodes of slow VT associated with
light-headedness and diaphoresis. There were at least 4 episodes
that lasted approximately 5 minutes and ended spontaneously.
Valsalva maneuvers were attempted with no effect. The patient
reports similar episodes for last month. Cardiology at [**Hospital3 **]
saw the patient and recommended stopping lidocaine and
amiodarone. He is transferred on po mexiletine, metoprolol, and
sotalol.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient is currently asymptomatic. He
denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea. While in the
PACU he had sustained VT after endocardial VT ablation coming to
the unit overnight for monitoring. He was given Quinidine, and
mexilitine as it was deemed he failed his sotalol therapy. one
amp of lidocaine, which helped break the VT and was in sinus
rhythm at the time of transfer.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
(+) lower back pain, R knee pain -- both chronic
On review of systems, He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
42-year-old male with CAD s/p CABG and PCI, ischemic
cardiomyopathy with EF of 30% s/p [**Hospital 26418**] transferred from [**Hospital 6451**] with slow VT.
.
# Recurrent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: Patient has had
symptoms for the past month that seem to be related to recurrent
VT.  He is currently in sinus rhythm and bradycardic. There were
several episodes of slow vtach s/p endocardial ablation. He was
still having VT and came to the CCU for observation. His sotalol
was discontinued. He was started on quinidine with final dose of
648 mg PO TID. His mexilitine 300mg PO Q8H  was decreased to
150mg PO Q8H in setting of QTc prolongation. He was started on
dabigatran 150mg [**Hospital1 **] to reduce thrombus risk however this was
discontinued. He had several episodes of slow VTach (HR low
100s) that broke with lopressor 5mg IV. He was discharged on
metoprolol succinate 150 mg PO qD in addition to magnesium. He
was considered for an another ablation by EP, but he had no
further episodes of ventricular tachycardia since [**2147-5-27**]. He
was monitored in the hospital with no further occurences and
discharged. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks.

It would be appropriate at follow-up to assess if the patient
should continue to take ritalin with structural heart disease
and history of ventricular tachycardia.


# CORONARIES: Pt has known CAD with most recent catheterization
showing reocclusion of SVG, but patent LIMA to LAD. EKG without
dynamic ischemic changes and flat enzymes at OSH. He was
continued on ASA, plavix, imdur, simvastatin, and reduced dose
of metoprolol (150 mg PO qD) based on blood pressure and heart
rate.

# PUMP: No clinical signs of heart failure. Last documented EF
30% in [**2144**], however no ECHO for 3 years. He was continued on
toprol, lisinopril, spironolactone.

# GERD: Asymptomaic. Continued on ranitidine and prilosec.
.
# Chronic lower back pain: Continued on oxycontin 40mg PO Q12H
.
# HTN: Continued antihypertensives as above
.
# Dyslipidemia: continue simvastatin and fenofibrate.

# Transitions of care
- Follow-up with EP, consider uptitration of metoprolol
succinate and imdur to prior home dose
