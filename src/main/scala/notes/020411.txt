NEURO: Nonfocal

Pertinent Results:
[**2182-8-9**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion.
POST_BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF 55%.
There is a mild AI and Mild TR.
Thoracic aortic contour is intact.

Improved aeration with improvement in volume status. Small
persistent bilateral pleural effusions. Left internal jugular
approach central line exchange apparently without complication.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2182-8-9**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to four vessels. Postoperatively he was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. The renal service followed
him given his history of end stage renal failure on
hemodialysis. CVVH was started for hyperkalemia and acidosis. On
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated. Packed red blood cells were transfused for
postoperative anemia. He was pancultured for a fever and was
started on levofloxacin and vancomycin empirically. Results of
his cultues were negative. Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed atrial flutter
and his beta blockade was increased. Amiodarone was not used
given his baseline elevated hepatic function enzymes. The
cardiology service was consulted who recommended cardioversion.
On [**2182-8-13**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent a successful cardioversion. On postoperative day five,
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. He continued his routine hemodialysis. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. Pt stable for home with VNA
