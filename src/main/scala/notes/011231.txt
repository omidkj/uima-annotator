Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization.


History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year old man with past medical history significant
for coronary artery disease with multiple stents to LCx and LAD,
diabetes, hypertension, who was admitted two months ago for GI
bleed and NSTEMI and now presents from OSH with chest pain.
This morning, he was using stationary bicycle at home for less
than five minutes when he developed burning substernal chest
pain [**9-13**], similar in quality to previous ischemic episodes.
Took 3 nitros with minimal relief and decided to go to hospital.
 At [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 19700**] Hospital ED, he was found to have TropI
5.02, BNP 2699; he was transferred by helicopter to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible intervention.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], T 99.9, HR 104, BP 150/68, RR 24, 96% on 3L
NC.  ECG notable for sinus tach with ST depression across
anterior precordium.  Initially pain free and plan was cath next
AM.  Patient then had return of chest pain with SBP in 80's.  No
change in EKG.  Taken to Cath lab emergently.
.
In cath lab [**10-26**]: LMCA was patent; LAD had 80% restenosis at
ostium; LCx had 100% in-stent restenosis.  DES was placed to L
main distal into the opening of LAD.  DES was also placed to
ostium/proximal LCx.  Right heart catheterization showed a wedge
pressure of 35.  PASP was 67. CI was 1.69.  He was transiently
on levophed and dopamine during the procedure and was
transferred from the cath to the CCU for further monitoring
.
Now in the CCU, patient denies lightheadedness; no palpitations.
 Now endorses CP [**4-13**], never fully disappeared during or after
cath.
.
Of note, he presented with CP in setting of GI bleed and NSTEMI
in [**2139-8-4**].  He had 100% occlusion of LCx stent; this was
balloon angioplastied.  There was also 70% occlusion of ostial
LAD; BMS was placed to this occlusion.

STUDIES:
.
EKG: NSR 100 with PACs.  RBBB with LAFB.  Diffuse ST-segment
depression in leads V1-V5.  TWI in I and aVL.
.
CORONARY CATHETERIZATION ([**2139-10-26**]):
1. Successful stenting of the ostial LAD restenosis with a
3.0x16mm
Taxus stent that was postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography
revealed no
residual stenosis, no angiogrpahically apparent dissection and
TIMI 3
flow (see PTCA comments).
2. Successful stenting of the ostial LCX restenosis with a
2.5x12mm
Taxus and a 3.0x8mm Taxus stents in overlapping fashion. Final
angiography revealed little residual stenosis, no
angiographically
apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow (see PTCA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful stenting of the LAD and LCX.
.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2139-10-28**]):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25 %) with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis. The remaining
segments are hypokinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
RIGHT GROIN DOPPLER ULTRASOUND ([**2139-10-28**]):
FINDINGS: Views of the right groin demonstrate a patent common
femoral artery and common femoral vein with adequate
wall-to-wall flow. There is no evidence of a pseudoaneurysm,
hematoma, or arteriovenous fistula.
.
RENAL ULTRASOUND ([**2139-10-29**]):
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 11.5 cm and the left kidney
measures 11.3 cm. There is no hydronephrosis and no stones or
solid masses are identified in either kidney. A simple cyst is
seen in the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 3.6 x 4.4 x
3.2 cm.
DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Note is made that this is a limited study
due to the
patient's body habitus and the patient's ability to hold his
breath. Color
Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained. Arterial
waveforms of
the main renal arteries bilaterally demonstrate sharp upstrokes.
RIs of the
intraparenchymal arteries in the right kidney range from
0.69-0.80. RIs of
the intraparenchymal arteries of the left kidney range from
0.73-0.76.
Appropriate flow is seen in the main renal vein bilaterally.
IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis and no renal stones identified. Simple
4.4-cm right
renal cy
