She had a stent placed on the right with percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty.  Following the procedure

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 81 year-old female with a
history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, peripheral
vascular disease and renal artery stenosis who presents for
elective carotid artery stenting on the right side.

1.  Neurological:  Status post carotid stent placement the
patient was continued on aspirin 325 mg po q.d., Plavix 75 mg
q.d.  She had neurological checks q one hours for six hours
and then q two hours with no focality and change in her
neurological examination.  Neurological team followed the

patient had the neo-synephrine drip turned off.

2.  Ischemia:  The patient was continued on aspirin, Plavix
as stated above.

3.  Hypercholesterolemia:  She was changed from Lipitor to

the Plavix.  Pravachol is not reported to have that
interaction and she will be discharged on Pravastatin in
place of Plavix.
