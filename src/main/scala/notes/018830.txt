Chief Complaint:
hypoxia and feeding tube replacement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation on [**10-17**]
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
55-year-old male who is s/p orthotropic liver [**Month/Year (2) **] in [**Month (only) 205**]
[**2108**] for alcoholic cirrhosis, history of colon cancer s/p
colectomy, on rapamune who was discharged from the ICU on
[**2111-9-22**] after an admission for sepsis, pneumonia, and severe
malnutrition. He required intubation during that admission and
sats were still low.  He was bronched and suctioned for large
mucus plugs. Given his mucus plugging he was ultimately trached.
 He then had an NG tube placed for his poor nutrition. The
decision was made not to place a feeding tube due to the liver
team's concerns of infection.
.
Per report from his nurse at rehab he weaned off the ventilator
well. He was decanulated last week and tolerated it well. His NG
tube had remained in place until earlier this week when it came
out.  2 days ago there was an attempt to place a dubhoff but it
could not be passed beyond the nasopharynx into the oropharynx.
The catheter would repeatedly enter the trachea.  He was
supposed to have it placed under guidance yesterday but no
anesthesiologist was available so he was sent back to Spauling
without the dubhoff placed.  He has received no TF or po
medications since [**10-13**] with the exception of sirolimus which he
has been allowed to take po. He's had no witnessed aspiration
events. He's been on D5 1/2 NS at 80cc/hr.
.
Yesterday evening when he became very anxious about not getting
the dubhoff placed and said that he felt like he would die. He
dropped his sats to the 70s and was placed on a NRB and it took
almost an hour for his sats to normalize.  His o2 sats increased
when he finally fell asleep. He was maintained on the NRB
overnight. He was weaned to NC of 2L this Am but his sats
dropped to 70s when at the side of the bed working with PT.
Earlier this week he was satting fine on 0-2L.
.
His most recent set of vitals at rehab were afebrile, BP 148/104
(generally 130-low 140s), HR 85, RR24 and 97% on 2L NC.  He has
been taking ice chips. He has been getting ativan 0.5mg IV q
6hrs and morphine 2mg q3hrs.  HCT was approx 29 on the 14th and
15th. Then on [**10-14**] and [**10-15**] HCT was 22. He received 2 units of
blood and his HCT increased to 37.5.  He was A & O x3 prior to
transfer.
.
On arrival to the ICU, vital signs were 97.9 99 151/89 RR22 93%
on 100% high flow face mask. He reports pain at the head of his
penis and pain with urination. He also reports that over the
last few days he has experienced spurts of SOB that occur
suddenly. He then begins to feel anxious like he is going to
die.  This occurs on and off.  He was decanulated last week and
says that his cough has improved over this time.  His cough is
productive of bloody mucusy sputum but only after traumatic
dubhoff placement.  He denies fevers or chills.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI , + for nausea, + for diarrhea less now that he has
not taken po x several days. Last week had between [**1-30**] BMs a
day. + for coughing up some blood since the attempts to place
dubhoff.
(-) Denies fever, chills. Denies headache, sinus tenderness,
rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies chest pain, chest pressure,
palpitations, or weakness. Denies vomiting, constipation,
abdominal pain, no blood in stool, no black stool. Denies

Past Medical History:
#. Alcoholic cirrhosis, s/p Liver [**Month/Day (1) **] [**2109-6-6**], [**2109-6-23**]
exploration for hematoma and fluid collection, last liver biopsy

[**2110-3-14**] no acute cellular rejection, but [**Month/Day/Year 65**] for increased iron

deposition.
-H/o malnutrition
-Prior ESLD c/b ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, grade II
esophageal varices and portal gastropathy, candidal and
bacterial (SBP) peritonitis
Post-[**Month/Day/Year **] course has been complicated by diarrhea and
malnutrition s/p extensive workup that has not found a cause.
This diarrhea is controlled with cholestyramine, Imodium,
tincture of opium, and he has [**12-31**] bowel movements a day.
#. Recurrent UTIs: Most recent cultures ([**2110-5-7**]) grew pan
sensitive kleb pnemonia and corynebacterium, but in the past has

grown out resistant strains of pseudomonas sensitive only to
meropenem ([**3-6**]), to amikacin ([**2-3**]).
#. History of Torsades while on ciprofloxacin.
- Of note: recent hospitalization [**4-5**] w/ multiple episodes of

VT/torsades s/p magnesium & cardioversion x2. At that time
thought [**12-30**] to meds (Reglan, celexa, lyrica and Bactrim) and
contribution from congenital long QTc. QTc was 499-536 despite
holding meds and given daily magnesium and potassium.
- Cardiology evaluated him ad thought not a candidate at that
time for implantable device given recent infections. Followed as

outpatient by cardiology thought pt stress cardiomyopathy,
recommended avoiding zofran.
#. Anemia with baseline Hct 27-30
#. Hydroureteroephrosis/Urinary retention: Seen by [**Month/Day (2) **] as
outpatient. Most recent OMR note: secondary to recurrent
infections and that intermittent catheterization led to
hydronephrosis. Managed w/ indwelling foley.
#. Colorectal cancer (stage unknown) s/p colectomy in [**11/2108**]
#. Cervical stenosis
#. History of C Diff colitis
