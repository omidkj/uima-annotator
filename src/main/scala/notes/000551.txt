History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 67 yo male with PMH of EtOH cirrhosis with HCC s/p
OLT on [**2104-8-22**] p/w acute onset SOB last night. He was watching
TV
when he suddenly epxerienced difficulty breathing that continued
worsen and he went to the hospital in [**Hospital3 **] where he was
found
to have pulmonary edema and increased creatinine to 4. He was
subsequently transported to [**Hospital1 18**]. Patient reports chest
tightness, but denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers,
chills. He felt well prior to the episode and had a regular day
at work. He denies any changes in the amount of his urine output
or the urine color. He had no blood transfusions since the last
admission here on [**2106-9-8**]. He denies hematemasis or
hematochezia.

Of note: Patient was admitted to us on [**2106-9-8**] for low
hematocrit
of 19 and stayed overnight. He was transfused 3units of PRBCs on
that admission. The transplant hepatology, transplant
nephrology,
hematology and cardiology services were consulted at that time.
The hematology service determined that patient does not have any
hematologic abnormality that could explain his chrnically low
hematocrit. Patient did not have a work-up to r/o GI bleed as he
refused. There was no need for hemodialysis at that time. His
transplanted liver has been functioning well.

CXR:
Study Date of [**2106-9-23**] 10:02 AM  Worsening pleural effusions and
confluent bilateral perihilar opacities are consistent with
pulmonary edema.

Study Date of [**2106-9-28**] 12:16 AM  In comparison with the study of
[**9-27**], there is continued moderate left pleural effusion and
smaller right effusion. Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.

RENAL U.S. PORT Study Date of [**2106-9-23**] 11:15 AM
IMPRESSION: Echogenic kidneys, the appearance of which is
suggestive of
diffuse parenchymal disease. No hydronephrosis. Two tiny left
renal cyst.

Echocardiography [**2106-9-23**] 11:00 AM
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Normal right ventricular systolic
function. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
[**Month/Day/Year **].
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-3-18**],
mitral regurgitation severity has slightly diminished and RV
regional wall motion abnormalities have resolved. The other
findings are similar.

ECG Study Date of [**2106-9-23**]  12:30:32 PM
Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Anteroseptal ST-T
wave changes may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy or
ischemia. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2106-7-31**] the ST-T wave changes are now
involving lead V4 which may be due to lead placement. Otherwise,
no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical ICU.  He was diagnosed
with acute CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema and acute renal
failure.  An echo and a renal ultrasound were done (see
results).  The nephrology team was consulted for assistance with
diurese.  Over the course of his ICU stay he received IV lasix
boluses, then a lasix gtt with good effect. He progressively had
decreasing oxygen requirements.  His renal function stabilized
as well.  Transplant hepatology was consulted with no further
recommendations.  His blood pressure medications were increased
as he had slightly elevated blood pressures during his stay as
he neared discharge.

He was ambulating, tolerating a regular diet, and was breathing
comfortably on room air with SaO2 of 100% on discharge to home.
