Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
rigors

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

2. IVIG administration


History of Present Illness:
34 year-old man with PMH CML s/p alloSCT [**8-26**] complicated by
CNS toxoplasmosis and GVHD of skin who is here for rigors, but
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**2121-9-24**] where he was treated for
pneumonia with cefepime (2 days of IV) and levofloxacin ([**5-3**]
day course) and followed for possible pericarditis (elevated
troponin 0.41 with flat CK. ECG s/o 3:2 wenkebach with RBBB
pattern).  Since patient was discharged he said he was having
chills and a temp > 100 degrees F.  He has been taking his levo
and has not missed any doses.  He has lost ~ 8 lbs in 1 week,
likely because he is not eating and drinking as much.  He said
in addition to the chills and fevers, he has continued to cough
(productive of clear sputum, no mucous or blood), have dizziness
(mostly when he stands up), lightheadedness (again with
standing), occasional dyspnea and headache (4-5 days).  He says
when he is sick he has a headache.  This ha is throbbing lasts
for a few hrs a day and is associated with photophobia.  He
denies night sweats, diarrhea, melena, cp, increased sob,
vomiting, neck stiffness, sick contacts, dysuria, hematuria,
back pain, abd. pain, rinorrhea and eye pain.
.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Onc hx: CML - diagnosed in [**2115-3-25**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**] is his
primary oncologist. Previously treated with Hydroxyurea and then
Gleevec with complete cytogenic remission. He subsequently
underwent a allogeneic bone marrow transplant [**8-26**]; preparative

Cyclosporin for his post bone marrow transplant course. His
course has been complicated by Grade I graft versus host disease
(including scleroderma of his arms and chest wall) of the skin
that resolved with low doses of steriods. He had reactivation of
CMV ([**10-26**]) and was treated with valgancyclovir. Also had CNS
toxoplasmosis ([**12-28**]) 1.5 yrs ago. He has had extensive chronic
graft versus host disease, cutaneous manifestations with
myositis and scelroderma. Currently on Rituxan - last given
[**2121-9-15**]. He is taking his CellCept [**Pager number **] mg twice a day, and
Prednisone 10 mg a day. He is receiving Pentamidine monthly
(last dose [**2121-10-21**]).

.studies:
[**9-29**] cxr: Likely small bilateral pleural effusions. Otherwise,
unremarkable chest radiograph.
.
CT HEAD [**2121-9-29**]: No mass or hemorrhage; stable L. occiptal
bright area c/w calcification. Recommend MR study.
.
Mr head: FINDINGS: There is no slow diffusion to indicate an
acute infarct. There are no areas of abnormal enhancement. Since
the prior examination, there has been no change. Again, there
are areas of magnetic susceptibility in the medial left
occipital lobe, two foci in the left frontal lobe and within the
left putamen. Lesions within the left occipital lobe and within
the left frontal lobe are associated with small amounts of
adjacent T2 signal hyperintensity, which is unchanged. The
additional left frontal lobe lesion as well as the lesion in the
left putamen are present but more subtle on the prior
examination.
No additional foci of abnormal brain parenchymal signal are
noted. There is no mass effect or hydrocephalus. The normal
vascular flow voids are present.
MPRESSION: No significant change from the prior examination with
stable lesions as described above.
.
Cardiac MR: Impression:
1. Mildy increased left ventricular cavity dimension with normal
regional left ventricular systolic function. The LVEF was normal
at 65%. No MR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and function. The RVEF
was normal at 56%. No MR evidence of right ventricular fatty
infiltration/dysplasia.
3. The indexed diameters of the ascending aorta and descending
thoracic aorta were mildly increased. The main pulmonary artery
diameter index was mildly increased.
4. Normal coronary artery origins.
5. There was no focal mass within the pericardium or within the
myocardium. There is no MR evidence of infiltrative disease.
.
Echo [**10-3**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or  color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic  function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion is  normal. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size  and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation.  No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
