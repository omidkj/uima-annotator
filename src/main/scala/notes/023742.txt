Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED during CT she experienced an episode of
unresponsiveness x 20 seconds and afib.  A non-rebreather was
applied. EKG showed a wide QRS  with ST elevation. IV fluid was
given. Dilaudid and zofran were given for persistent complaints
of abdominal pain. She was transferred to the SICU. A Heparin
drip was started for the distal SMA thrombus. A cardiac echo was
performed to r/o intracardiac thrombus. Cardiac echo showed
moderate symmetric LVH with a mild mid-cavitary gradient (16mm
Hg). Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. Diastolic
dysfunction. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with
a dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle. Left pleural effusion.

A CVL was inserted to assess CVP. Serial abominal exams were
performed with serial lactic acid levels monitored. Lactate
increased from 2.9 to 4.5  IV antibiotics (Cipro and Levo)
continued.

Nephrology was consulted and planned to do CVVHD.

Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] examined her and reviewed CT scan. She
developed increasing abdominal pain and wbc count. Given these
findings, she was taken to OR where and ex lap was performed for
ischemic bowel. Please see operative report for complete
details. Per operative report extensive gangrenous changes of
the small bowel beginning in proximal to midjejunum and
extending all the way to the right colon were found. No doppler
or palpable signals within the mesenteric arcade of the
gangrenous sections were identified. Vascular surgery was
consulted, but did not feel that further intervention was
warrented. After discussion with the patient's proxy/son, the
decision was made to make her CMO given the poor prognosis of
75-80% of the small [**Last Name (un) **] infarction. She was transferred back to
the SICU.

She was maintained on a morphine drip for comfort while her son
and family were at the bedside. She was extubated and expired
shortly after extubation.
