HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
gentleman on Coumadin who presented to an outside hospital on
[**2153-6-26**]
complaining of massive frontal headache.  Headache started
about 5 p.m., by 6 p.m. the patient's speech had become
nonsensical and with confusion.  The patient was taken to
[**Hospital 47**] Hospital, where CT showed  3 x 5 cm
left temporoparietal ICH intracranial bleed.  INR at that time
was 5.8.  He was given
2 units of fresh frozen plasma and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**].  He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] complaining
of headache in frontal area was noted to be aphasic with
word finding difficulties and  no motor deficits.


MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:
1. Coumadin.
2. Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.
3. Prilosec 20 mg q.d.
4. Lipitor 40 mg q.d.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Splenectomy in [**2127**] for splenic
laceration.

Cholecystectomy.
Barretts Esophagus
Rotator cuff repair.

PFO StarFlex seal.
Multiple PE's- Negative out patient work-up for hypercoag
state placed on Coumadin. Hypertension.
MI in [**2149**]/Afib and TIA's
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 13.5,
hematocrit 38.2, and platelets 343.  [**Name (NI) 2591**], PT 19.5, PTT
35.5, and INR 2.5.  Electrolytes, sodium 138, potassium 4.1,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 25, BUN 12, creatinine 0.8, and
glucose 125.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  CT showed a large 5.5 x 4.2 cm
left temporal, parietal, intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding edema.  Positive mass effect.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals at the time of admission,
temperature was 97.3 degrees, heart rate was 76, respiratory
rate was 20, blood pressure was 133/88, and SPO2 was 97
percent room air.  Upon physical exam, the patient was
cooperative in no apparent distress.  Extraocular movements
were intact.  He had 1-beat nystagmus on the left lateral
side.  His peripherals were intact.  Pupils were 3 to 2 mm
with brisk reaction.  There was no apparent trauma.  His
speech was aphasic.  He had difficulty word finding.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  Tongue was
midline.  Face was symmetric.  He showed no drift, strength
was 5 out of 5 bilaterally.  His sensory was intact to light
touch throughout.  His deep tendon reflexes were 2 plus
bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 56-year-old with intraparenchymal,
temporal, parietal hemorrhage.  He was given Dilantin 1 g to
be continued 100 mg t.i.d.  He was given 6 units of FFP and
vitamin K with goal INR of less than 1.3. He was admitted to
the SICU. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] was reluctant to evacuate the hematoma
due to excellent mental status and eloquence of brain in the
region of hematoma, with potential of significantly worsening
patient aphasia. The management plan was to reverse
coagulopathy, keep INR< 1.3, treat mass effect/brain swelling
with Mannitol through period of maximal brain swelling.  An
MRI/MRA was performed to rule out an underlying vascular
lesion.

HOSPITAL COURSE: On Mr. [**Known lastname 3517**] first hospital day
Hemostasis/Thrombosis consultation was obtained.  Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2805**] had no specific recommendation at that ti by. Mrs.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2805**] no new recommendations were made in Mr [**Known lastname 3527**] care.
It had been reported in the past that the patient had Heparin
Induced Thrombocytopenia ( HIT), Heparin SQ
was held, venodyne boots continued.
Mr. [**Known lastname 3517**] was managed medically with close neurological
checks, serial CT scans of his brain were obtained to rule out
increasing hematoma/mass effect and Mannitol was used to help
reduce
swelling.  Each day he was noted to have slight increase
improvement with his speach, periodically requiring additional
doses of mannitol.
On [**7-10**] the patient became acutely short of breathe,
tachycardic with room h ICU at 06:30.  He had no evidence of
tachycardic with room air oxygen saturation was 82%.  A CTA of
his chest was performed demonstrated bilaterally pulmonary
emboli.  Mr [**Known lastname 3517**] was transferred to MICU and after
consultation with hematology the joint decision was made to
begin a Heparin infusion without a bolus and to place an IVC
filter.  The risk of HIT was considered but Heparin the safest
anticoagulant due to the potential for reversing it with
protamine.  The patient was managed by the MICU team from
7/13-7-20 with Neurosurgery service following patient in
consultation.  Mr. [**Known lastname 3517**] experienced a probable seizure on
[**7-11**], repeat cranial CT revealed no change and MICU team
consulted Neurology for their recommendations.  During his
MICU admission, remained hemodynamically stable with
intermittent desaturations responsive to oxygen therapy, and
his aphasia continued to improve.  On [**7-17**] the patient was
switched from Heparin to Lovenox per Hematology's
recommendations. He was dosed according to Hematology's
recommendations.  He was transferred to the surgical floor on
[**7-17**].  Patient was screened for a
appropriate rehabilitation facility.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  His discharge instructions are
continue to monitor neurological status and continue with
Lovenox anticoagulation therapy.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:  He is status post left temporoparietal
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage and status post pulmonary embolisms.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:  Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in 1
month, and please obtain an MRI with and without gadolinium
contrast prior to appointment. He should follow-up with his
hematologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27542**].
