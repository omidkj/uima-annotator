History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 y/o M w/COPD, DM, hyperlipidemia who presents with
cough x 2 days. He noted a nonproductive cough as well as fevers

other complaints. Does not check his fingersticks at home.

In the ED, he was slightly febrile and tachycardic. He was
empirically started on steroid therapy, and Levofloxacin, as
well as nebs. He was also hyperglycemic to the mid 300s and was
given insulin. He was admitted to medicine.

Past Medical History:

CXR [**2132-2-1**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

ECG [**2132-2-1**]: Sinus arrhythmia. Incomplete right bundle-branch
block. Since the previous tracing of [**2129-4-27**] no significant
change.

Echo [**2132-2-5**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a
loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

CT chest [**2132-2-7**]: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2.
Disproportionate enlargement of the left pulmonary artery
compared to the main and right pulmonary arteries, as shown on
the prior chest radiograph. While no pulmonary embolism is seen,
this finding may be also be seen more chronically in the setting
of pulmonary artery stenosis and pulmonart artery hypertension
may be [**Last Name (un) **] chronic lung disease. 3. Moderate centrilobular
emphysema. 4. Parenchymal subpleural opacities in the dependent
portions of the left lower lobe as well as the right upper lobe.
Right upper lobe findings appear to be dependent atelectasis.
Left lower lobe findings are probably a combination of
atelectasis and perhaps a degree of aspiration as well. However,
given the presence of underlying emphysema, recommend followup
examination to ensure resolution. 5. Coronary artery
calcifications.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year-old male, ex-smoker, admitted with cough and shortness
of breath. His hospital course will be reviewed by problems.

1) Cough/SOB: His initial presentation was felt most consistent
with a COPD flare, and he was started on parenteral steroids,
bronchodilator therapy with nebulizers and Levofloxacin for
coverage of possible tracheobronchitis. His CXR was without
evidence of pneumonia. He was eventually converted to oral
steroids, but continued to have marked bronchospasm and high
osygen requirement. He was eventually transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for high nursing care requirements, and proceeded to develop
hypercarbic respiratory failure following Haldol therapy
requiring intubation. He was succesfully extubated, and
transferred back to the floor.

He continued to have high oxygen requirements. A CTA on [**2-7**]
was nnegative for PE and without significant massess or
lymphadenopathy, but showed evidence of a dilated left pulmonary
artery suggestive of PA hypertension. A prior echo on [**2-5**] was
also consistent with moderate pulmonary hypertension, without TV
dilatation or atrial enlargemet.

The pulmonary service was consulted to further comment on his
hypoxemia. His hypoxemia was felt to be multifactorial, with
severe COPD (PFTs obtained on [**2132-2-14**] revealed FVC 0.97 (24%),
FEV1 0.51 (20%), ratio 83%) the most important contributor. The
possibility of a R->L shunt was also raised, but bubble study
was negative for ASD or PFO.
He completed a course of levofloxacin and was started on a slow
prednisone taper for the COPD. His oxygen saturations slowly
improved, and at discharge was requiring 0-1 liters via nasal
cannula. He will need to be evaluated for home oxygen use.

2. Arrhythmia: While on the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**], Mr. [**Known lastname 95655**] had
repeated episodes of supraventricular tachycardia to the 160's.
Review of the EKGs reveal that he had intermittent aflutter with
RVR. At other times, EKGs showed ST with PACs versus MAT. He was
initially started on beta blockade therapy for rate control,
which was changed to Verapamil per EP given his concomitant
pulmonary disease and bronchospasm. EP was consulted, and
recommendation was made to transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for
chemical conversion with Dofetilide therapy (poor candidate for
amiodarone given his pulmonary disease). Of note, he was also
started on Coumadin for anticoagulation.

Upon transfer, Verapamil was changed to Diltiazem, and he was
started on Dofetilide on [**2132-2-13**]. He continues to have
occasional episodes of supraventricular tachycardia while on
Dofetilide. QTc has been stable. The Diltiazem was titrated up
to 90 mg QID and will be discharged on Diltiazem ER 360 mg
daily.

4. Metabolic alkalosis/respiratory acidosis: While in hospital,
his HCO3 rose up to 41. His metabolic alkalosis was felt to be a
combination of chronic hypercarbia, with likely contribution
from steroid therapy. We started Diamox on [**2132-2-15**], with
improvement in HCO3 to 35, (goal HCO3 = 35 per Pulmonary). His
HCO3 will need to be monitored after discharge weekly. The
diomox was discontinued on [**2132-2-19**] because his creatinine was
beginning to rise slightly and his bicarb normalized.

5. DM type 2: He was continued on his out-patient regimen of
Avandia. Metformin was discontinued in the hospital in the
setting of ongoing hypoxemia, variable PO intake. He was covered
with a RISS QID. His glycemic control was further exacerbated by
steroid thera
