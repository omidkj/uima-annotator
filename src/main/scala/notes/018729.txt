Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3266**]
Chief Complaint:
CC - transfer from OSH for liver failure [**2-23**] ?amiodarone
toxicity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Liver biopsy [**2146-9-6**]

Paracentesis [**2146-9-7**]

History of Present Illness:
HPI - This is a 69 y/o male with a PMH significant for CAD,
COPD, PAF, DM who presented to his PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 205**] with symptoms of
decreased appetite, fatigue, and increased abdominal girth over
the last six months. There, he was found to have increased
ascites, worsening liver function, and increased LE edema. He
was sent to [**Location (un) **] for further evaluation.
On initial admission to [**Location (un) **], had elevated LFTs with Alk P in
500's, and AST/ALT in 200-300's range. Amiodarone was d/c'd at
that point, and Medrol 8 mg [**Hospital1 **] was started. GI followed pt
while in-house and CT of abd done showed hyperdense liver that
was c/w possible amiodarone toxicity. MRI was c/w ascites and
gallstone w/o bile duct dilitation. He had an extensive workup
for elevated LFTs, and workup for autoimminue causes, viral
causes, and hemachromatosis were all negative. During his
admission, the LFTs began to trend down to 140-150 range, 200
range for alk phos. Pt was d/c'd to rehab on high-dose steroids.

However, he represented to [**Location (un) **] with abd fullness and SOB [**2-23**]
ascites and anasarca. LFTs during the second admission were
unchanged with alk phos in the 400 range, with acute renal
function worsening (Cr 2.4 -> 3.3). This second admission was
also significant for an increase in WBC from 20 to 38, pt
remaining afebrile.
Upon review of incomplete old records that were obtained, it
appears that the patient was started on Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **] in
[**12-24**] following a valve replacement surgery c/b atrial
fibrillation. He remained on this dose of amiodarone until it
was d/c'd at [**Location (un) **].

ROS - positive for abdominal fullness, decreased appetite,
recent diarrhea, and fatigue
    - negative for any H/A, vision changes, cough, SOB, CP, abd
pain, n/v, melena/hematochezia/BRBPR, tremors

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 y/o man with PMH significant for CAD, DM, COPD, a
fib, who was on chronic amiodarone since [**12-24**] for rhythm
control of a fib, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after an
extensive workup for liver disease of unknown origin. Workup
there was notable for hyperdense liver, ascites; and negative
for any autoimmune, viral/infectious, hemachromatosis causes. Pt
also here with ARF on CRI.

1. Liver failure/renal failure - Most likely multifactorial,
also likely that it was [**2-23**] amiodarone toxicity, based on his
prior workup. Workup at OSH for autoi
