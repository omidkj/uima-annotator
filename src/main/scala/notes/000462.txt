Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, fever, and lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD pacemaker lead extraction with attempt at vegetation removal
via femoral access

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2157**], sick
sinus syndrome s/p PM/ICD placement in [**2163**], and dilated
cardiomyopathy with EF of 35%, who presented to [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital on [**6-3**] with fever and lethargy.  The patient was
reportedly feeling unwell for approximately one month prior to
admission.  On the day of admission, she was at a family [**Holiday **]
dinner and was noted to be lethargic, weak, and pale.  EMS was
thus called, and she was brought to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for
further evaluation.
.
At the OSH, the patient was initially febrile to 102 and her K+
in the ED was 7.6.  She was in respiratory distress and was
placed on BiPAP and was noted to have a LLL infiltrate on CXR.
Blood cultures subsequently grew GPCs in clusters in [**5-14**]
bottles, and a TTE demonstrated a vegetation on her AICD lead.
She was started on Vancomycin and Ampicillin.  The decision was
made to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for lead extraction.
.
Review of systems is positive for headache and mild shortness of
breath.  Otherwise, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

MICROBIOLOGY
Blood and urine cultures: no growth

IMAGING
TTE [**6-18**]:
.
.
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior akinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is
present. The gradient across the mitral valve is increased (mean
= 17 mmHg). There is a moderate-sized vegetation on the mitral
valve ([**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of the anterior leaflet, 0.8 cm). Mild to
moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**6-11**]/201, the
tricupsid valve vegetation is not clearly seen (may be because
of poor image quality rather than resolution). The degree of
pulmonary hypertension and RV dilation has decreased. The mitral
vegetaiton appears similar.
.
.
EKG: The rhythm appears to be intermittent atrial paced and
sinus but low amplitude wave forms make assessment difficult.
Left bundle-branch block with left axis deviation. Since the
previous tracing of [**2164-6-6**] the rate is slower and ectopy is
absent.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72 year old female with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2157**], DM2,
SSS s/p PM/ICD placement in [**2163-6-11**] and dilated cardiomyopathy
who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**6-3**] with fever and
lethargy, found to have vegetations on AICD leads, Mitral valve
and Tricuspid valvee and Enterococcal sepsis, was transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**6-5**] where ICD leads were extracted and IV antibiotics
were initiated for endocarditis. Now discharged to rehab and
planned for completion of 6 week course of antibiotics.

lethargy,Blood cultures revealed entercocci in [**9-17**] bottles as
well as in her urine cul
