Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**1-5**] Externalization of VP shunt to EVD
[**1-11**] VPS revision
[**1-19**] PEG Tube placement


History of Present Illness:
26-year-old man with pinealoma s/p VP shunt presents with
altered
mental status. On [**2186-12-28**], patient was found unresponsive by
family, incontinent of urine. EMS gave naloxone without effect.
Patient was brought to [**Hospital 6138**] hospital. WBC 10, Hct 48, plt
215, Cr 1.2, LFTs wnl, alcohol < 10 mg/dl. Acetaminophen, TCA,
salcicylate negative. Cardiac biomarkers negative. Head CT
showed
unchanged right-sided VP shunt. CXR was unremarkable. Naloxone
was again given. He was initially nonverbal but then slowly
minimally verbal and oriented to name and place. Patient denied
drug or alcohol use. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Of note patient was admitted in late [**2186-10-16**] also for
altered mental status. Infection was ruled out. The presumed
diagnosis at that time was overdose of suboxone or other
substance abuse.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T 98.7, HR 74, BP 120/84, RR 16, 98% 2L NC.
Neurosurg tapped VPS; CSF cell counts unremarkable. Admitted.

CT HEAD [**1-4**]
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or new mass
effect. If there is continued concern for parenchymal changes,
MR can be considered if not CI.
2. Slightly decreased but persistent moderate hydrocephalus
compared to prior study from [**2186-12-28**]. Continued
followup as clinically indicated.

MRI [**1-4**]
1. Marked short-interval worsening of hydrocephalus when
compared to the
[**2187-1-4**] CT and, particularly, the recent [**2187-1-1**] MR, with
new
transependymal migration of CSF. The findings suggest
ventricular shunt
malfunction.
2. Pineal mass, overall similar to prior.

CT HEAD [**1-6**]
1. Status post externalization of the right transfrontal
ventricular drain, with expected small amount of hemorrhage
along the tract, small pneumocephalus and trace intraventricular
hemorrhage.
2. Overall unchanged dilated lateral ventricles and third
ventricle.
3. Unchanged partially-calcified pineal mass.

NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW:
The tip of the catheter is noted to be in the septum/ superior
surface of the 3rd ventricle rather than within the 3rd
ventricle itself ( se 300b, im 35); part of the catheter is onto
the medial aspect of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] partially extending into
the region fo the septum and this is a change from prior study.
Correlate clincially for catheter function and if the position
of the tip is desirable. Persistent periventricualr hypodense
appearance related to CSF seepage. D/[**Last Name (NamePattern5) 87489**] by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2187-1-6**] at 1.40pm.

CT HEAD [**1-7**]
1. Stable degree of hydrocephalus, with stable appearance of
right frontal
approach EVD with its tip terminating in the region of the
interventricular septum. There is no new hemorrhage or mass
effect.
2. Stable appearance of calcified pineal mass.

CT Head [**1-11**]:
1. Moderate ventriculomegaly, unchanhged. Right frontal
intraventricular
hemorrhage is now more apprent.
2. Intraventricular portion of the VP shunt in similar position
compared to prior.
3. Pineal mass, unchanged

[**1-20**] - [**1-22**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to
the presence of a slow background which reached a maximum of a 6
Hz frequency. This represents a moderate encephalopathy. It is
also abnormal due to the bursts of generalized delta slowing,
indicating deeper involvemtn of the which encephalopathy. There
were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures in
this recording.

[**1-22**] Brain MRI:  IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent hydrocephalus, increased compared with prior
despite presence of VP shunt and recent shunt exchange. This is
concerning for inadequate shunt or shunt malfunction.
2. No acute abnormality, though a large portion of the right
frontal lobe is not well visualized due to metallic artifact
from the patient's shunt valve.


Brief Hospital Course:
26 yo M with pinealoma s/p VP shunt presenting with altered
mental status including lethargy and marked psychomotor slowing.

The patient presented with profound psychomotor slowing and
lethargy. He had an initial metabolic and infectious work-up
that was negative including normal chem 7, CBC, LFT's, lactate,
ammonia and urinalysis. The VP shunt was accessed by
neurosurgery and found to have good flow, both drawing and
flushing. CT head completed at an outside hospital was reviewed
with a local radiologist (images are in the [**Hospital1 18**] PACS system)
and was felt to show unchanged chronic mild hydrocephalus with
unchanged VP shunt position and no appreciable change in the
pineal mass. CSF cell counts were within normal limits and CSF
cultures are thus far without growth. The patient was cocaine
positive in the urine and given his known history of
polysubstance abuse including marijuana, barbituates, suboxone
and alcohol, a toxic ingestion initially was felt to be the most
likely explanation. However, his mother and sisters relayed a
history of subacute or chronic lethargy and psychomotor slowing
for many weeks with intermittent exacerbations requiring
hospitalization including in mid [**Month (only) 1096**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] when he was
barbiturate positive.

With conservative management including hydration and supportive
care, the patient failed to show significant improvement.
Therefore an extended work-up was pursued. EEG revealed
generalized slowing cons
