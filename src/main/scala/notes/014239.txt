Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8104**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
62 yo male with hx of ?Crohns, hypertension, ?seizure d/o
tranfered from [**Hospital3 **] s/p intubation for b/l pneumonia.
Patient apparently with 3-4 days of fever and cough. Per EMTs he
had a chest cold with non-productive cough without CP or SOB.
He was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 3 days PTA and took cold medication
without relief.  In the field he was not in respiratory
distress.  BP 170/88, HR 100.  His RR was 16 and 96%/RA. He was
then evaluated in the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where his VS were: 102.8, 124,
168/80, 40, 81%/RA at 1230pm.  CXR reported to have b/l
pneumonia.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia with ?TWI though
difficult to assess. He was intubated and given Levaquin and
Ceftriaxone.  Per their record, he received seasonal influenza
vaccine.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 **] his VS were: T100 (rectal), 86  113/59, 22,
97% on vent.  ABG on AC, TV 550, Rate 14, Fi02 100, PEEP 5 was:
7.32/41/294 at 1700.

Urine and blood cultures were sent. A CTA torso was done and
showed small right-sided subsegmental PEs. NGT was placed and
patient was given Ceftriaxone 1 gram IV and 3 L of IVF. He was
sedated on Midazolam and Fentanyl. A Heparin drip was started.
Received ceftriaxone in [**Hospital1 18**] ED and received levofloxacin in
[**Hospital1 **]. VS on transfer to the ICU were: HR 60, BP 93/51, RR 15,
O2Sat 100% (CMV TV 550, f 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%).  On review of
records, notable for SBPs to 80s in ED. so versed was decreased
and fentanyl stopped.

CT abd/pelvis with contrast [**12-20**]
1. Progression of bibasilar atelectasis and consolidation
consistent with
pneumonia. The known pulmonary emboli which were demonstrated
previously were not examined on this abdomen and pelvis CT.
2. Interval increase in gallbladder distention and new
pericholecystic fluid. The findings are potentially concerning
for acute cholecystitis; clinical correlation is recommended.
This could be further assessed with ultrasound and/or HIDA scan.

TTE [**2106-12-20**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters
are most consistent with normal left ventricular diastolic
function. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild
to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CTA torso [**12-19**]
CT CHEST: There are filling defects within the right
subsegmental arteries
(3, 14 and 3, 26) supplying the anterior and posterior segments.
In addition, filling defects involving the right middle lobe
subsegmental branches (3, 47) are also identified. There are
possible left upper lobe subgmental pulmonary emboli (3,24).
There are bilateral lower lobe consolidations with air
bronchograms (3, 57). While this may represent atelectasis as it
is enhancing, underlying infection cannot be excluded given the
presence of air bronchograms. There are multiple mediastinal and
left hilar lymph nodes. For example, at example, there is a left
hilar lymph node measuring 1.3 x 1.5 cm (3, 43). A prevascular
lymph node measures 0.7 x 2.3 cm (3, 27). There is no axillary
lymphadenopathy identified. There is no pleural effusion. Very
trace pericardial fluid vs thickening is noted. There is no
evidence of aortic dissection. No pneumothorax is seen.
Gynecomastia is noted.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The spleen, liver, gallbladder, pancreas,
adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable. There is mild
amount of perinephric fat stranding, bilaterally, nonspecific.
Multiple small, subcentimeter
