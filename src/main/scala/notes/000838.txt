Brief Hospital Course:
Following transferred from the outside hospital for surgical
evaluation he underwent preoperative workup, including a
pulmonary consult due to his tobacco history.  His steroids
started at the outside hospital were stopped and he was started
on Lasix for diuresis.

On [**2146-12-6**] he was taken to the Operating Room and underwent
aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft
surgery. Please see operative report for details, in summary he
had aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease
pericardial tissue valve, coronary artery bypass grafting x2,
with reverse
saphenous vein graft to the second diagonal artery and the
obtuse marginal artery.
His bypass time was 118 minutes with a crossclamp of 97 minutes.
He tolerated the opration and was transferred to the cardiac
surgery ICU. He received vancomycin for perioperative
antibiotics.

He remained stable in the immediate post-op period, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He remained in the
cardiac surgery ICU for several days post-operatively because
there were no beds available on the stepdown floor. All tubes,
lines, and drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.

Once on the stepdown floor he worked with Physical Therapy to
improve his strength and endurance. The remainder of his
hospital course was uneventful. His progress was somewhat slow
and it was felt he would benefit from a short rehabilitation
stay. On [**12-12**] he was cleared to be transferred to [**Hospital3 15644**]
Health Care Center for rehab.  Lasix was continued at discharge
and can be discontinued when edema clears.
