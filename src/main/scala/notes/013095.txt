History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with a history of CHF, ?UC, and CRI who was
intially admitted to [**Hospital6 8283**] [**2171-10-11**] after
she passed out after a sudden episode of large black stool at
Windamere NH where she resides.  At MVH, she received 5U PRBC's
over 10 days in response to Hct on admission at 30.  She had a
Hct nadir at 20 over her hospitalization, now hct stable @ 30 x
3 days (baseline hct 30).  She had a negative EGD and a
colonoscopy on [**2171-10-16**] up to 60cm only (secondary inadequate
prep).  She had no hematemesis during her hospitalization and
had a "minimal" amount of black stool since admission.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] intensive care on [**10-22**] for further work
up.  In the intensive care unit, the patient was treated for
H.pylori, transfused 2 units PRBCs on [**10-23**] and [**10-24**], yet was
unable to have colonoscopy because the patient refusing prep.
The patient was also hypernatremic on admission, which resolved
after free water repletion.  The patient was occasionally
bradycardic with episodes of pauses, but she was never
symptomatic and often sleeping. Most notably, the patient had
intermittent melena (small amts, at most 50 cc)but managed to
stay hemodynamically stable with stable Hct 32.  The patient
communicates only via writing since she is deaf.  The patient
was transferred to a regular medicine floor for further
management.

IMPRESSION: Focal area of increased tracer uptake in the
anterior right pelvis which does not appear to be within the GI
tract. It is unclear what the etiology of this is, but
possibilities include a fistula, hemangioma or pelvic kidney.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  GI bleed: After the patient's initial presentation with
melena, she still had small amts of melena (averaging 1 episode
of approx 30-50 cc/2-3days).  She received a total of 5U PRBC's
over 10 days at OSH and an additional 6 units at [**Hospital1 18**].
Transfusion criterion was to main Hct above 27.  Etiology of the
patient's GI bleed remained cryptic after EGD which revealed
mild gastritis.  Despite being H.pylori positive, no ulcers were
noted.  Nonetheless, the patient was treated with pantoprazole
twice daily.  Clarithromycin and amoxicillin were given for a 14
day course.  Colonoscopy at MVH up to 60cm was also unrevealing.
 Repeat colonscopy at [**Hospital1 18**] showed a polyp in the proximal
ascending colon, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, blood in
the entire colon and terminal ileum.  Thus a source of bleeding
was not identified.  Repeat EGD at [**Hospital1 18**] showed large hiatal
hernia, in the upper potion of the hiatal hernia a healed linear
erosion, in the antrum a partially healed linear ulcer.  The
colonoscope was inserted to the mid-jejunum and no lesions were
found in careful examination of the small bowel.  It was
recommended that the patient continue on proton pump inhibitors
and the general impression was that the bleeding site was either
of the two abnormalities seen because they were healing.  Of
note, the [**Hospital 228**] medical records specified a history of UC,
but the patient denies this history and colonoscopy was not
consistent with that diagnosis.  A tagged red cell GI bleeding
was also performed which showed a focal area of increased tracer
uptake in the anterior right pelvis which did not appear to be
within the GI tract.  It was unclear what the etiology of this
is, but possibilities include a fistula, hemangioma or pelvic
kidney.  Hematocrits were checked serially 2-3 times per day and
the patient was able to hold stable values around 30 for three
days at a time.  The patient was sent for a small bowel follow
through to evaluate for possible strictures or Crohn's, but the
study was normal, without any evidence of strictures,
dilatation, or mucosal abnormality.  Despite the above full
series of studies, it was difficult to unequivocally identify
source of the patient's bleeding.  It was believed that source
was related to healing erosions seen on EGD, but definitive
diagnosis would only be possible with open surgery.  After
discussions with the patient, her niece, and the GI service, it
was thought that the morbidity of exploratory laparotomy to find
source of bleeding would carry too much of a risk for the
patient. Empiric hormonal therapy with estrogen could be tried
next if the GI bleeding continues.  Antibiotic course for H.
pylori has been completed.

2.  CHF - From her outside record, the patient was on standing
lasix.  She never appeared to be in failure throughout her floor
admission and consistently appeared euvolemic to slightly
hypovolemic on exam.  Lasix was held given hypovolemia and
likely pre-load dependence given moderate AS.

3.  Hypernatremia - Na 153 on admission was likely secondary to
hypovolemic hypernatremia.  Sodium levels improved to normal
limits after free water repletion.  Daily monitoring revealed no
repeat episodes of hyponatremia.

4.  CRI - The patient carried a diagnosis of chronic renal
insufficiency with baseline creat of 1.8, but this value
improved to 0.8 on iv fluids.

5. Bradycardia - The patient had rare episodes of sinus
bradycardia with occasional pauses and junctional escape rhythm.
 One episode was associated with hypotension but on iv fluid
resuscitation, blood pressure were within normal limits.  She
was never symptomatic.  The patient was evaluated by cardiology
and bradycardia as well as syncopal episode at [**Hospital3 4298**]
were fe
