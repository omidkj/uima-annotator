Allergies:
Ketorolac / azithromycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
Right and left sided cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 41432**] is a 61 year-old woman with DM, HTN, COPD and CHF
who this morning complained to family of acute respiratory
distress. Per the patient's daughter, this morning the patient
was able to walk her dog a short distance and complained of some
SOB. She also complained of some heartburn this morning. She
subsequently retired to her room for several minutes before
returning to her daughter to request emergency attention. EMS
arrived and found her in extremis with heart rate of 150 with
difficulty identifing heart rhythm and gave adenosine 6 mg and
then 12 mg without response and then gave 25mg of IV diltiazem
and started BiPAP.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was in respiratory distress with
rales on exam and unable to speak more than one word. Given her
poor respiratory status, she was electively intubated. She had
physical exam and CXR evidence of pulmonary edema consistent
with a CHF exacerbation and received 40mg of IV lasix in the ED
and was transfered to the CCU for further management. On
transfer, vital signs were HR 101 BP 115/66 RR 20 SpO2 98% on
vent: rate 20, PEEP 10, tv 600, 80% FiO2

On arrival to the CCU, she was sedated and intubated with HR 96
BP 119/64 and intubated with unchanged ventilator settings.
Patient was intermittently responsive despite intubation and
sedation and patient's family was present in room for medical
interview and exam.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Cath Report [**2159-8-6**]:

COMMENTS:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated no obstructive coronary artery disease.
2) Rest hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right-sided
filling
pressures with a mean RA pressure of 11 mmHg, mildly-elevated
pulmonary
arterial pressures with a mean PA pressure of 35 mmHg, and
moderate-to-severely elevated left-sided pressures with a mean
wedge of
24 mmHg. There was mild systemic arterial hypertension with a
central
aortic pressure of 140/79.
3) Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Mildly-elevated right-sided and pulmonary arterial pressures.
3. Moderate-to-sever
