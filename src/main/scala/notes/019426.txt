Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5378**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right PICC line
Sural nerve biopsy
CT-guided liver biopsy
Lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74 yo R-handed woman with paroxysmal Afibb,
CAD, and recently diagnosed adenoma of the ampulla of Vater, who
was transferred from an OSH for further workup and management of
weakness.

The patient looks very tired when interviewed. She is not able
to
provide exact information with respect to time of onset and
progression. Family is not available to provide further details.


According to the patient, her symptoms started around the same
time that she was diagnosed with her adenoma, which was at the
end of [**Month (only) 547**]. Given her medical problems, she was not a suitable
surgical candidate and a stent was placed. It not exactly clear,
where she resided after this procedure. She was admitted to
[**Hospital3 4107**] on [**5-19**] where she was diagnosed with
constipation
and diverticulitis.

She says that the weakness progressed slowly over weeks. She
felt
tired all the time and she was told to rest some more. The
weakness involved both sides evenly according to the patient.
Her
legs feel somewhat weaker than her arms. She is still able to
comb her hair. Standing up and walking stairs was one of the
first things that was difficult for her. Currently (according to
the patient since about 3 weeks), she is not able to stand or
walk on her own. She denies any tingling or numbness. She also
says she has not been incontinent, with no urgency or frequency
(but she does have a Foley in).
She had a Bell's palsy on the R many years ago (when she gave
birth to twins), but this seems to have become more prominent
over the last weeks.

Hospital course at OSH: [**Date range (1) 51738**]: afebrile; she had some
abdominal pain thought to be due to diverticulitis and
constipation. She has been on long term dicloxacillin for
chronic
osteomyelitis in her R-knee. The disease is not active. KUB:
fecal impaction, no SBO; CXR: mild CHF; plain films knees:
osteochondromatosis, no acute active disease. During the
admission, her weakness was noted, but no clear etiology was
found (MRI C- and spine). She does have a compression fracture
of
T11 vertebra, but no cord compression was seen.

ROS:  poor appetite since onset of her symptoms; denies any
fever, chills, weight loss, visual changes, hearing changes,
headache, neckpain, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, or
bright red blood per rectum. No rash; no itch. No back or
neckpain today. Appetite decreased.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old woman with adenoma of pappilla of Vater; severe
weakness with increased tone in LE; inattentive on exam
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
MRI C-spine with contrast; signal abnormality; neoplastic
process
MR CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, [**2155-5-29**]

HISTORY: Severe weakness and increased tone in lower
extremities.

Sagittal imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin
echo and short TR, short TE spin echo technique. Axial imaging
was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo and with
gradient echo technique. After administration of gadolinium
intravenous contrast, sagittal short TR, short TE spin echo
imaging was repeated. No prior cervical spine imaging studies
are available for comparison.

FINDINGS: Alignment of the cervical spine is normal. There is a
focus of hyperintensity on the short TR images in the C6
vertebral body, perhaps reflecting focal fat deposition or a
small hemangioma. Vertebral body signal intensity is otherwise
normal. There are degenerative changes of the intervertebral
discs with loss of signal and loss of height, most prominent
from C4 through C7. There are small intervertebral osteophytes
at C5-6 and C6-7. These narrow the spinal canal but do not
appear to encroach upon the spinal cord. The axial images are
severely degraded by motion artifact and are nondiagnostic.
