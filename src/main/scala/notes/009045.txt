PA 37/11.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.4, heart rate 70 in
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 190/99, respiratory rate 20, O2
saturations 97% on room air.  General:  The patient was alert
and oriented x 3, moved all extremities, followed commands.

Extraocular movements intact.  Anicteric, noninjected

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2182-4-9**] and taken to the
operating room where a three-vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting was performed as well as an aortic valve
replacement.

Postoperatively the patient was transferred to the
cardiothoracic surgical intensive care unit.  He had
mediastinal and chest tubes in place, pacing wires in place.
He received prophylactic vancomycin doses x 4.  On his first
postoperative day the patient experienced ventricular
tachycardia x 20 beats.  He required milrinone and Levophed
drips.  At the appropriate times the patient's drips were
stopped.  He was started on beta blockade.  He was also
started on amiodarone when his ventricular tachycardia
recurred.  When his creatinine fell he was started on Lasix.
He was also started on amlodipine.  Once the patient's
hypertensive medications were regulated to appropriately
control his blood pressure the patient was transferred to the
regular cardiothoracic surgery floor where he thrived.  He
has been visited by physical therapy who has worked with him
extensively and is comfortable with him going to a
rehabilitation facility.  Therefore today, [**2182-4-17**], he is
being discharged to rehabilitation.
