Pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
87 y/o F w/h/o HTN who was in her USOH which included dressing
herself, cooking, and driving until 4-5 days PTA when she begcam
eslightly forgetful adn not making sense at times.  2 days PTA
she developed a non-productive cough and soem swelling in one
leg (which had swollen intermittently int he past since an
accident.)  On the day of admission, she awoke, had breakfast,
and read the paper but c/o increasing swelling in both legs,
some SOB, and a "funny feeling of being ill".  She was walking
down her steps when she suddenly asked her daughter to take her
to the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 58893**] clinic.  Upon arrival there, she arrested in
the parking lot.  Initially it was a PEA arrest and she was
given epi, then converted to VT, was shocked, converted to type
2 second degree HB, which degenerated to complete heart block.
She was intubated, begun on dopamine, transcutaneously paced and
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU.

TTE [**2159-1-15**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(slightly
preserved thickening at the base and infero-lateral walls).
Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen (due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of MR may be
underestimated). Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe, global LV hypokinesis (LVEF 20-25%). Normal
RV cavity size
and systolic function. No significant aortic or mitral
regurgitation seen.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

ECG from OSH:  Mobitz type 2, 2:1 with RBBB, PRWP, [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevation in V2, TWI in I, avL
(all other ECG's paced)


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Complete heart block:  Upon admission to the CCU, a pacing
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed by the Electrophysiology fellow,
and the pt was transvenously paced.  It was felt that she
developed conduction system disease in the setting of ischemia
although other etiology were ruled out, including thyroid
disease (mildly elevated TSH likely [**1-10**] sick euthyroid),
myeloma.  On [**1-16**], she underwent placement of a [**Company 1543**] Sigma
DR [**Last Name (STitle) **], and her temp wires were removed.  She was given
vancomycin while in the hospital and cephalexin on d/c for a
total of one week of antibiotics due to the pacemaker placement.
 Her pacemaker was interrogated and felt to be working well.

2. CHF:  The etiology of this was felt to be ischemic given the
WMA on echo (anteroseptal HK).  Her bp was initially supported
with dopamine, and she was given lasix as tolerated to a wedge
of 20-22.  She was begun on a heparin gtt, placed on ASA and
statin.  She was weaned off the dopamine by HD3.  A TTE done
revealed EF 20-25%.  Once she was off dopamine, she was placed
on an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker as her bp/pulse
tolerated.  She was diuresed with lasix prn, and sent home on
Lasix 20 mg po qd with potassium supplementation.  She could be
a candidate for coumadin given her low EF and WMA, but given her
guaiac pos stool and hx of falls, it was felt to be too risky.

3. ARF:  Felt to be due to hypoperfusion of kidneys while she
was hypotensive.  Resolved with improved bp.

4. SOB:  Felt to be due to CHF.  Also, there was a report from
the OSH that she had possibly aspirated and so was covered with
levaquin and flagyl for presumed aspiration pna.  She was
extubated by HD3.  The levaquin and flagyl were discontinued as
she did not develop an infiltrate on CXR, remained afebrile, and
her leucocytosis resolved.  She did desaturate w/ambulation, and
was discharged on home o2 (again, this was felt due to CHF).

5. Anemia:  Her hematocrit dropped 10 points and her stool was
guaiac positive.  Her heparin gtt was discontinued.  She was
transfused with an appropriate response, and it was recommend
that she have GI f/u as an outpatient.  Her hematocrit remained
stable post-tranfusion.
