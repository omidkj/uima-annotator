Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 60 yo man with h/o ESRD on HD, ESLD [**3-16**] HepC,
seizure d/o, who presented to the ED with bradycardia. The
patient states that he was in his normal state of health until
three days ago, when he began to develop increased shortness of
breath. He stated that he felt subjective fevers at home;
however, he never documented a fever. He normally has HD on
M/W/F, but he rescheduled today's HD session for tomorrow. This
afternoon, the patient began to feel weak and dizzy at home and
found that his pulse was significantly slower (30s-40s). He has
experienced a similar situation approximately 3 times over the
past year, so he presented to the ED for further workup and
evaluation.

In the ED, the patient's VS were T 97.9 BP 164/75 P 37 O2 96% on
RA. His pulse was persistently in the 30s-40s. He complained of
lightheadedness and dizziness, but no CP. ECG showed junctional
rhythm with retrograde P waves. Trop is at baseline. Labs were
drawn which showed a K of 6.7. He was given Calcium gluconate,
Kayexelate, D50, Sodium Bicarbonate, and insulin, and his ECG
converted to sinus bigeminy. He then became increasingly
hypertensive to 220/130s and reportedly complained of active
chest pain. He was given NTG SL, which did not alleviate his
pain, and he was then started on a nitro gtt. EKG at this time
showed ST depressions in V4-V6. He was then transferred to the
CCU for emergent HD and further observation.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient states that he does not
currently feel any chest pain and he solely felt "chest
pressure" in the ED, which was not concerning to him.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Chest Portable (AP)
Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Moderate pulmonary
edema has
improved. Aeration in the bases of the lungs has also improved.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Small right pleural
effusion is more conspicuous on today's exam. Central venous
catheter is in a standard position.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 60 yo man with h/o End Stage Renal Disease on
hemodialysis, Hepatits C cirrhosis, and Seizure disorder, who
presents with bradycardia and hypertensive emergency in the
setting of a missed HD session.

# Bradycardia: The patient presented with symptomatic junctional
bradycardia with a long QT and a rate of 30s-40s. His K on
admission was 6.7  Emergent HD was performed in the CCU, with an
output of 2.5 liters. After the procedure, the potassium
decreased to 4.7. He was monitored on telemetry and did not have
any further episodes of bradycardia. It is likely that the
patient was hyperkalemic because he missed a session of
hemodialysis the morning prior to admission. His hyperkalemia
was the etiology behind his bradycardia. He is advised to make
all of his hemodialysis appointments.

# Hypertensive Urgency/Emergency: The patient's BP in the ED
increased to 230s/130. He had concomitant chest pain, and there
was concern for ACS. His EKG during this episode did not show
ischemic changes, but a chronic strain pattern seen with chronic
severe hypertension. The patient was given Nitroglycerin SL and
was started on a nitroglycerin drip, which decreased his BP and
relieved his CP.  The patient has a history of labile BPs, and
this current episode is most likely related to his fluid
overload.

 After the nitro drip was weaned down, the patient was restarted
on his home medications of lisinopril, clonidine, metoprolol,
and nifedipine. He is to follow up closely with his nephrologist
and primary doctor for further managment.

# Pneumonia: Patient complained of a new productive cough and
subjective fever. On chest xray it appeared that an infiltrate
was forming. Since the patient is at high risk for infection on
hemodialysis, he was started on a five day course of
Azithromycin for community acquried pneumonia. He is to
follow-up with his primary care doctor next week and have a
repeat chest x-ray in [**3-17**] weeks.

# End Stage Renal Disase: The patient has a history of ESRD, for
which he receives hemodialysis on M/W/F. He received HD
overnight and 2.5 liters were taken off. He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout and his potassium decreased to
a normal level. He is to continue follow-up with his
nephrologist next week.

# HepC Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of HepC cirrhosis,
and he recently took himself off of the [**Date Range **] list. His
liver function appeared stable throughout this admission. He is
currently taking Rifaximin 200 mg TID, he is to continue this
medication and follow up with his PCP for further management.

# Seizures: The patient has a history
