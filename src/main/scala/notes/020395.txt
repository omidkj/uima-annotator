Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2150-4-27**] Aortic Valve Replacement(21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic Tissue
Valve)


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old female with long-standing aortic stenosis.
Over the past several months, she has experienced worsening
dypsnea on exertion. Most recent echocardiogram showed severe
aortic stenosis with an valve area of 0.9 cm2. She also
underwent cardiac catheterization which confirmed severe aortic
stenosis(valve area 0.67 cm2, mean gradient 31mmHg) and revealed
normal coronary arteries. She was therefore referred for aortic
valve replacement.

Past Medical History:
-Aortic Stenosis
-Dyslipidemia
-Hypertension
-History of Pulmonary Embolus and Acute Renal Insufficiency
following Total Abd Hysterectomy
-Left Total Knee Replacement
-Open cholecystectomy
-Appendectomy


Social History:
30 pack year history, quit tobacco 20 years ago. Drinks ETOH
socially. Lives alone. Retired.

Family History:
No premature coronary artery disease. Mother valve replacement
in her 80's.

Physical Exam:
Admission:
Vitals: 151/79, 80, 14
General: obese female in no acute distress
Skin: warm, dry. no rashes
HEENT: oropharynx benign
Neck: supple, no jvd
Chest: clear breath sounds bilaterally
Heart: regular rate and rhythm, s1s2, 3/6 systolic ejection
murmur heard throughout the precordium and carotid region
Abdomen: benign
Extremities: warm, no edema
Neuro: grossly intact
Pulses: 1+ distally

Pertinent Results:
[**2150-4-27**] Intraop TEE:
PREBYPASS
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. A patent foramen ovale is
present with left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest. 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. 4. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. 5. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(area<0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 6.
The mitral valve is mildly thickened, with trivial mitral
regurgitation.

POSTBYPASS
1. Patient is on phenylephrine infusion.2. There is a well
seated, well functioning tissue valve seen in the aortic
position. Mean gradient is 22 mmHg 3. The right ventricle is
moderately dysfunctional. Air is seen by the [**Month/Day/Year 5059**] in the
right coronary artery. Epinephrine started with good results,
the RV function is improved 4. The LV function remains good 5.
The aortic contours remain smooth after decannulation

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **]' [**Known lastname **] was admitted and taken to the OR for AVR (21mm
St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] epic porcine). See operative note for details. Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 105826**] was transported intubated and on phenylephrine and
propofol drips to the cardiac ICU.  Mrs.[**Known lastname **] was extubated
on POD#1. Betablockers and diuresis was initiated. Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) 105827**]
developed post operative afib on POD#2 which responded to
amiodarone and she converted to sinus rhythm. Chest tubes and
pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery post op protocol.
Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) 105827**] was transferred from the ICU on POD#3. Shr required
aggressive pul tiolet and diuresis to wean from oxygen. On POD#6
Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) 105827**] complained of blurry vision in right eye. She was
seen by opthalmology and thought to have retinal artery
occlusion likelt due to emboli. No anticoagulation was
recommended per opthalmology. It was recommended that she follow
up with her opthalmologist in one month. A carotid ultrasound
was obtained and revealed no significant stenosis.
 She was seen by physical therapy and was cleared for discharge
to home on POD#8.
