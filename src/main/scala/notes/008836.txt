History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: The patient is an 86 y/o M with a
PMH of Alzheimers Dementia, NPH s/p VP shunt, MRSA osteomyelitis
admitted from rehab with altered mental status and hypoxia. Per
NH staff, the patient was unarousable x 2min when they attempted
to wake him from sleep. The patient was recently transferred
from [**State 108**] after being hospitalized with Alzheimer's dementia
with behavioral disturbances It is unclear what medication
changes were made at that time. He was hospitalized in [**7-10**]
with L foot osteomyelitis and underwent L great toe amputation.
He was discharged home with VNA. He was then readmitted with
agitation. Per OSH record the patient has significant dementia,
worsening since [**2158-6-1**] after being diagnosed with NPH and
undergoing VP shunt complicated by subdural hematoma.
.
The patient was medicated with ativan during the flight to
[**Location (un) 86**] from [**State 108**]. His wife had reported a [**2-2**] week of
coughing and aspiration on arrival to [**Hospital1 599**]. The patient was
noted by NH to have cough and wheeze X 4 days with decreased po
intake. He was weaned off ativan per report. CXR [**9-8**] did not
show evidence of PNA. Labs [**9-6**] Na 146 with BUN 51, Cr 1.4. On
[**9-10**] found to have Na 153. Over the last few days he has had
worsening oral intake. Found to have O2 sat of 87% on RA today.
Sent to ED for evaluation of hypoxia. Per report the patient has
had difficulty swallowing, question of aspiration. Also noted to
have Acute delierum over 3 days.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.5 P 40-90 in AF BP 140/77 R 22
O2 sat 98% on . On labs he was found to have Na 155. After 500cc
NS bolus x2 Na remained 154. WBC 14.7 with 14% bands. ABG
7.55/28/68/25.
Clindamycin and levaquin for concern of aspiration pneumonia.
ASA 600mg rectally. Ativan 2mg IV X2. Tylenol 650 mg rectally.
CXR demonstrated a RLL infiltrate. CT Head with no intracranial
hemorrhage, has moderate enlargement of the ventricles with a
left frontal ventriculostomy catheter. Left foot xray with post
op changes; no signs of acute osteo. Lactate 2.0. CK 69 with
trop 0.09. EKG: v paced beats with native beats with fusion
beats; no evidence ischemia; Discussed with cardiology who felt
TWI were secondary to twave memory; trop elev in setting of
infection and hypovolemia.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was somnolent but arousable.
He is not able to provide history.

CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-10**] and 11:

Bibasilar consolidation which worsened between [**9-10**] and
[**9-11**] has
stabilized on the left, worsened slightly on the right where
there is now
suggestion of cavitation. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Upper
lungs clear.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads in
place. No
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion

Foot x ray, [**9-10**]
LEFT FOOT, TWO VIEWS: Post-surgical changes from partial
amputation of the
left great toe with stump containing the proximal portion of the
proximal
phalanx. The 4th and 5th toe are overlapping, limiting
evaluation. The
overlying soft tissues are radiographically normal. No acute
fracture. There
are no focal osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesions. There is no
evidence of
subcutaneous gas. Extensive vascular calcifications are noted.

IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes from partial amputation of the
left great
toe. No definite radiographic evidence of acute osteomyelitis.



Brief Hospital Course:
86 y/o M with a PMH of Alzheimers Dementia, NPH s/p VP shunt,
MRSA osteomyelitis, now with improved mental status and
currently being treated for PNA.
.
# Pneumonia - Patient was admitted with relative hypoxia and a
leukocytosis. While he was afebrile on admission, a CXR
demonstrated a RLL. The PNA was thought to be secondary to
aspiration based on a history of witnessed aspiration prior to
admission as well as the results of a video swallow performed on
[**9-13**] that were indicative of dysphagia. In addition to
aspiration, atypical organisms were also considered as the
patient is elderly and on chronic steroids. In the hospital, the
patient was placed on oxygen therapy, Vancomycin, Levaquin,
Cefepime, and Flagyl. His oxygen saturation improved and he was
weaned off O2, but he continued to have a productive cough
without evidence of respiratory compromise. In the MICU, his
Levaquin and Flagyl were held after 1 day of treatment.  The
patient's leukocytosis worsened to 20, however, and a repeat CXR
was performed on [**9-12**] that showed a cavitation in the right
lower lobe. Consequently, after transfer to the medicine floor,
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was restarted on Flagyl for a presumed aspiration
pneumonia and his mental status improved significantly. His
Vancomycin and Cepepime were also continued. Mr. [**Known lastname **] home
dose of Advair was continued for his history of COPD.
.
# L foot Osteo MRSA [**7-10**] s/p recent L toe amputation: X-ray of
the L foot on [**9-11**] was interpreted as no evidence of acute
osteomyelitis. Podiatry was consulted and stated that while
there is some necrotic tissue on the 2nd and 5th toes, a large
bulla on the lateral foot and some ulceration, they do not
believe there are any signs of active infection. They also
offered that he may have chronic osteomyelitis, but that given
his fun
