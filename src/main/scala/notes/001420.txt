History of Present Illness:
47yo M with h/o HIV not on HAART presnted to PCP's office and
then to our ED with non-productive cough, hiccups, jaundice, and
icterus x 4 days. Had "flu" about four weeks ago with
predominant symptom rhinorrha. This resolved on its own and
patient has not felt sweaty at night or febrile.

4 days ago developed a cough and presented initially to PCP's
office who noted the jaundice, SaO2=97% RA, no desaturation with
ambulation and hepatomegaly on exam. Labs at PCP notable for
WBC [**Numeric Identifier 43204**] (3060 bands), Hb/HCT 11.8/35.7 ESR 119, Na 120, Cl 86,
Ca 7.7, Alb 2.7, TB 10.2, DB 6.6, SGOT 294, SGPT 225. PCP
referred him to ED.

Of note patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2108**] with FUO. Had a
multitude of tests sent including EBV (IgM non-reactive, one IGG
reactive and the other negative), CMV (negative), RMSF
(negative) and HIV which returned positive. He has since been
followed at [**Hospital1 778**] Health and is not treated with HAART per his
PCP.

In the ED Initial Vitals: T:100.1 HR:140 BP:117/82 18 O2Sat:94%.
Jaundice on exam but feels fine and wouldnt have come to ED
withotu PCP's advice. LLL PNA on CXR. given 2 DS Bactrim tablet
to cover PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 14990**] 750mg PO. abd US shows splenomegaly
but no acute thrombus. LFTs elevated. Lactate trended down with
2L NS. Has also spiked fever to 102.2 and receiving toradol for
the fever.
EKG: sinus tachy and non specific TW changes and persistent
tachycardia to 130s with 3L NS so admission changed from floor
to ICU.

On arrival to the floor patient c/o feeling hot and slightly
short of breath. Otherwise denied abdominal pain, dysuria,
frequency, chest pain, shoulder pain, rash, sick contacts,
palpitations. Did endorse dark colored urine X 1 day at home.

EKG:  Sinus tachycardia at 130bpm. No ST/TW changes

Imaging:
CXR: Patchy right upper and left lower lobe opacities raise
concern for multi-focal pneumonia.

CXR [**2-13**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there
is no relevant
change. Evidence of a left basal opacity with air bronchograms,
extending
both behind the heart and in the left lateral and perihilar lung
areas.
Minimal additional overhydration cannot be excluded. Borderline
size of the
cardiac silhouette. No evidence of pleural effusions. No newly
appeared
parenchymal opacities.

CXR [**2-14**]: Tip of the new left PIC line is in the low SVC. There
is no pneumothorax,
pleural effusion or mediastinal widening. Heart size is normal.
Consolidation in the left lower lobe has been present since
[**2-12**] and
could represent either atelectasis or pneumonia. Lungs are
otherwise clear
and there is no appreciable pleural effusion.

Abd U/S:
IMPRESSION: Prominence of the portal triads may be due to acute
hepatitis.  Recommend correlation with serum LFTs. Splenomegaly.
No ascites. Patent portal vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
47yo M with h/o HIV not on HAART admitted to the MICU with a
multifocal PNA and with liver injury likely secondary to sepsis,
also with bacteremia.

# Hypoxia/multifocal pneumonia/gram positive cocci bactermia:
The patient's presentation of fever, leukocytosis, and
tachycardia along with the CXR showing a multifocal PNA point
towards a lung infection as his underlying process.  Blood
cultures grew out gram postive cocci, later speciated to
pansensitive strep pneumo.  Initially he was broadly treated
with vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin (for legionella/atypicals),
and bactrim (for PCP).  ID was consulted and recommended
starting steroids, even though PCP was less likely until sputum
culture ruled out PCP. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] he steroids were discontinued when
strep pneumo was speciated from the blood.  He had no recent CD4
count so this was repeated and returned at 71.  Once the blood
cultures came back his antibiotics were tailored to CTX only.
He will need to complete a 14 day course.

# Hepatocellular injury:  Patient with acutely elevated
bilirubin and INR with a moderate transaminitis.  With the
preceding viral-like illness would consider
EBV/CMV/VZV/influenza as well as bacterial infection with
legionella most likely.  Abdom
