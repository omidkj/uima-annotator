or TLS spine.  She was in a cervical collar.  Rectal:  She
had normal rectal tone with a negative guaiac.  Extremities:
She had multiple lacerations to her right upper extremity
across the wrist and forearm.  She had superficial knee
abrasions on the right side.  No other visible bony
deformities of the extremities were seen.  She had 2+
symmetrical pulses throughout.

RADIOLOGY:  A FAST exam was performed which was negative.  A
chest x-ray was negative.  An AP of the pelvis was negative.
CT of the head showed a right subdural hematoma with a few
millimeter shift, as well as a right frontal contusion.  CT
of the cervical spine was negative.  CT of the abdomen and
pelvis showed a right iliac aneurysm that was stable.

X-rays of the right humerus were negative.  X-rays of the

right radius and ulnar were negative.  X-rays of the right
hand and thumb were negative.  X-rays of the right femur were
negative.  X-rays of the right knee were negative.  X-rays of
the right tibia-fibula were negative.  A TLS x-ray showed no
chronic compression deformities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the Trauma Bay, the patient was
started on Nipride drip to maintain her systolic blood
pressure below 140.  She was also given a gram of Dilantin.

An emergent Neurosurgery consult was obtained.  The patient
was transferred to the Trauma SICU where she was placed on
q.1 hour neurochecks.  A subclavian central line was placed,
as well as an arterial line.

Later on hospital day #1, it was noted that she had a change
in her neurological exam at which point a CT was repeated,
and there was equivocal worsening of the CT exam.  At that
point, it was decided to intubate the patient.

The patient remained in the Trauma SICU for an additional
three days.  Her neurological exam was stable.  She was
periodically awakened from sedation and was able to move all
extremities and follow commands.  She was also started on
Labetalol drip for tight blood pressure control.  She also
had tight glucose control as well.

On hospital day #2, her hematocrit was noted to reach a nadir
of 25.7 at which point she was transfused 2 U.  While in the
Intensive Care Unit, an MRI of the cervical spine was
obtained which was negative, and her cervical spine was
cleared.

On hospital day #5, the patient was transferred to the floor.
An NG tube was placed, and with Nutrition consult, tube feeds
were started.

At the time of her transfer to the floor, the patient was off
all sedation.  She continued to remain quite somnolent and
would wake to sternal rub but was unable to articulate or
follow command.  She had regular family visits, and at
various points throughout the day, her sons would report that
she would wax and wane in delirium.

On hospital day #6, the patient continued to remain
somnolent, and head CT was repeated which was stable.  She
had an isolated fever spike of 101?????? at which point she was
pancultured.  Chest x-ray was negative.

Blood cultures were sent, and the subclavian line was pulled.
The tip was sent for culture which was negative.  The blood
cultures sent grew 3 out of 4 Methicillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus.  A urine showed that she had a urinary
tract infection.  The patient was started initially on
Levofloxacin and Vancomycin for broad coverage.  Once the
sensitivities of the blood culture were known, the Vancomycin
was discontinued, and she continued on a 10-day course of
Vancomycin.

On hospital day #7, 8 and 9, the patient continued to remain
somnolent; however, she was hemodynamically stable
throughout.  She had frequent loud breathing, and the thought
was that there was some secretions at the back of her throat,
and therefore Respiratory Therapy was called in, and she had
aggressive pulmonary toilet.

By hospital day #10 and 11, the family was noting again that
the patient would wax in and out of delirium and have periods
of time where she would be able to interact and sing songs
with them, and other times would be completely somnolent.

She remained on tube feeds, and there was some question as to
what her abilities with regards to nutrition would be.  The
question of PEG tube insertion was brought up with the
family, and at that point they agreed.

On hospital day #12, the patient was the most alert at any of
the house staff or the family had seen her.  She was asking
questions, still seemed confused, but was coherent in her
statements and appropriate.

At the time of this dictation, placement of the PEG tube has
been deferred.  The patient will undergo a speech and swallow
study, which if she is able to pass, will be able to be
discharged to rehabilitation without a PEG.

Throughout her time on the floor, the patient had close and
frequent contact with Occupational Therapy and Physical
Therapy who would assist her in getting out of bed.

The patient also had suture removal on hospital day #12 from
the right wrist laceration and the right forehead laceration.
