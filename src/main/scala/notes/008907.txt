History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 63124**] is a 75 year old male nursing home resident with
schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, who was brought to
the ED today with increased agitation at the nursing home.  Most
of the history is obtained through the patient's sister and the
chart, as the patient himself is unable to give a history.  Per
the sister, he has been getting increasingly aggitated over the
last 6 months.  His medications have been adjusted (increased
haldol), however the psychiatrist at the nursing home recently
retired, and he has become difficult to manage.  He was
therefore brought to the ED this afternoon where he was found to
have a systolic bp of 80s, a fever, a CXR c/w PNA, and a
leukocytosis.  His lactate was 1.8.  He was given 5 L IVF, and
ceftriaxone and zithromax for presumed CAP, and started on
levophed for hypotension prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

On review of systems the patient's sister denies that he has
been complaining of anything.  When asked about his cough, she
says that he has had increasing congestion, though she is not
sure for how long.

Per report from the sister, he has been on a pureed diet with
thickened liquids at the nursing home.  Additional history was
obtained from sister who mentioned that patient had been
drinking a lot of water at soldiers home and would always ask
for it.

CXR AP portable [**2127-8-19**]:
FINDINGS: AP portable upright view of the chest. Heart size is
normal. Mediastinal contours are within normal limits. Right and
left pulmonary artery contours appear prominent, which may be
related to pulmonary hypertension. The diaphragm is flattened,
consistent with COPD. There is a patchy opacity in the right
medial lower lung field, which may represent atelectasis or
early consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures appear
unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old male nursing home resident with schizoaffective
disorder, presents with increased agitation over the last 6
months, found to have a leukocytosis and PNA by CXR, with
hypotension.

1) Pneumonia:  Patient with new RML infiltrate on CXR,
leukocytosis.  History of pureed diet, likely has aspiration
history therefore will cover for aspiration PNA in addition to
CAP.  He was started on IV antibiotics initially.  As he was
less agitated he received antibiotics by mouth.  He will be
treated for a total 14 days of levofloxacin and flagyl.
.
2) Hypotension:  Pt was noted to be hypotensive in ED.  Large
blood pressure differential between arms, and patient actually
not hypotensive in R arm.  Not sure which arm cuff was on in ED.
 In terms of blood pressure differential, will call NH in a.m.
to ascertain whether or not this has been documented in the
past; most likely subclavian stenosis on L.  However, aortic
dissection in differential.  Hct stable, no CP or back pain,
clinincally doesn't seem likely.  Earlier hypotension thought
could be sepsis, however lactate 1.8, patient not tachypneic,
though mildly febrile.  Possibly hypovolemic in setting of
infection and fever.  Has been getting aggressive fluids,
arrived with 6th L NS hung.  Will finish liter, then bolus PRN
with goal of weaning levophed to off ASAP.  Hold on a-line for
now given bp > 110 systolic and stable.  He was given IVF and
hypotension was resolved.  During the rest of his
hospitilization this was not an issue and his SBP remained above
100mmHg.

3) Schizoaffective disorder:  This is the main reason patient
was brought here; for assistance with medication regimen to
control aggression.  Change is not acute, likely related to
worsening dementia.  Psych was consulted who recommended
medications changes.  Several of his meds including lithium were
discontinued.  He was placed on tegretol, depakote and seroquel,
with Haldol as needed for agitation.  Pt was initially confused
and very agitated at times pulling at foley catheter requiring
restraints. During the hospitilization he improved with less
agitation.  All the tubes were discontinued and pt remained
stable requiring minimal prns.  His outpt dose is as listed in
the medications use.  The tegretol and depakote should be
continued and seroquel should be used as first line [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for
agitation as this can be titrated and his morning and evening
seroquel doses can be adjusted.  Depakote and tegretol levels
should be monitored to make sure pt is not supratherapeutic and
periodic ECG should be done given risk of qt prolongation on
seroquel.  Pt may also benefit from a psychatrist who can adjust
his medications.
.
4) Hypernatremia - on HD 2 he was noted to have na of 152.  Uosm
was 370 and serum osm was 307.  Given his previous use of
lithium, Diabetis insipidus is a likely etiology of this.  He
was given IV d5w for 2L and Na improved to 144.  After all the
tubes were discontinued and pt was no longer in restraints he
was taking enough water by mouth that his Na remained stable at
144.  He should be given water with 1:1 assist as needed.
.
5) COPD:  Patient without wheezes on exam.  Clear COPD on CXR.
His nebs were continued.  He did not have any desaturations or
complaints of shortness of breath.
.
6) PPx:  SQ heparin TID, no need for protonix.  Bowel regimen.
