History of Present Illness:
This is a 51 yo male who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital 2586**] for an UGIB but left yesterday AMA and presents
today to ED with hematochezia x 2 and lightheadedness. He was
initially hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] [**6-12**] from [**Location (un) 6692**]
airport after returning from a 6 week vacation in [**Country **].  The
day before he flew home, he had hematesis (bright blood) [**1-31**]
times. On the plane ride, he had "dark stool" x 1 and a doctor
on the plane noted a low blood pressure, made worse after taking
his norvasc (also got an aspirin). Upon arrival to [**Location (un) 6692**], he was
taking to [**Hospital3 5097**] and admitted to ICU with upper GI bleed
(hypotensive in 90s- recieved dopamine, IVFs) and course c/b
liver failure, renal failure, pneumonia. He was intubated to
protect his airway and was extubated about one week ago.  Had [**Hospital3 104734**] per wife. EGD report from [**6-14**] mentions Grade 3
esophagitis ([**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor First Name 1557**]), clean based gastric and duodenal
ulcers. No intervention preformed. EGD from [**6-18**] revealed  grade
3 esophagitis, gastric ulcers (clean-based) and a marginally
oozing doudenal ulcer with adherent clot s/p epi injection. No
colonscopy was performed although abd CT makes mention of
sigmoid diverticulosis. H. pylori antibody was negative. Per his
wife, he was taking NSAIDs prior to admission for intermittent
RUQ pain.

He left AMA yesterday because he was "frustrated" with his care
at [**Hospital3 5097**].  Since he left, he has had 2 episodes of
hematochezia ("[**Last Name (un) 104735**]-colored diarrhea") and this morning felt
lightheaded and unsteady on his wife. They called his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] who recommended calling EMS and going to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

At [**Hospital1 18**], he was noted to be pale with a BP of 85/50 and
tachycardic at 106.. NG lavage revealed gross blood that did not
clear after 500 cc lavage. HCT was 11.7. He received 4 L NS in
ED and typed and crossed for 4 units. Got 2 18 gauge PIVs &
foley placed. Received protonix 40 IV x 1 and erythromycin 500
IV x 1 in ED. Upon arrival to unit, central access was obtained
and EGD performed which was notable for multiple non-bleeding
gastric ulcers and esophagitis (no varices). No intervention was
done.
