Chest pain

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old male with known CAD, s/p anterior
MI in [**2145**] who presents with chest pain. Early this year patient
developed progressive decrease in his exercise tolerance, with
shortness of breath and chest tightness occuring with exertion
and resolving with rest. He was evaluated with a cardiac
catheterization that demonstrated 3vd and 90% occlusion of 1st
diagonal, reduced to 50% with POBA. Subsequently planned to
undergo CABG in [**2161-12-4**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Following that
procedure his symptoms improved and chest pain had nearly
resolved. Then in late [**2161-8-4**] (~2 months ago) chest pain
returned and unlike previously it started occuring at rest, and
required longer rest periods to alleviate his discomfort. This
has continued a few times a day for the past 2 months. The day
of admission he was eating an afternoon meal and not exerting
himself patient had the acute onset of chest pain. The key
difference this time was that it was more intense, lasted
longer, and returned ~10 minutes after it subsided. Describes it
as his typical substernal chest tightness that radiated down
both arms. At the onset of symptoms patient took ASA 162mg,
lopressor and when pain did not resolve he took 2sl nitro.
Following the second SL nitro pain resolved but then returned
~10 minutes later. He knew he could only take 1 more nitro so he
presented to an OSH for evaluation as this was first time he had
required nitro for chest pain in some time. At OSH, ECG showed
poor R wave progression, but no other acute changes. CE's
negative. He was given lovenox and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.

[**2161-11-4**] Carotid Ultrasound:
No significant stenosis identified (less than 40% bilaterally).
[**2161-11-5**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal
anterolateral and anterior hypokinesis and apical dyskinesis.
There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The number of aortic
valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the cardiology service
with unstable angina. He ruled out for myocardial infarction. He
remained pain free on intravenous Heparin and medical therapy.
In anticipation of surgical revascularization, Plavix was
discontinued. Prior to surgical intervention, extensive
preoperative evaluation was performed which included
echocardiogram, carotid ultrasound, vein mapping, and dental
clearance - please see result section for details. Preoperative
evaluation was notable for asymptomatic bacteruria which was
empirically treated with Ciprofloxacin(urine culture eventually
was negative). A monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance was also diagnosed as SPEP showed abnormal band in
gamma region. There was no evidence of lytic lesions, no
leukocytosis, and no lymphadenopathy with normal calcium levels.
A follow-up SPEP in [**5-15**] months is recommended to monitor for
progression. In addition, he was followed closely by wound care
for his chronic lower extremity ulcer. His wound remained stable
and did show clinical improvement with adaptic dressing changes
daily. Preoperative course was otherwise unremarkable and he was
eventually cleared for surgery.

On [**11-10**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed an aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Surgery
was complicated by coagulopathy which did not improve after
multiple blood products. On postoperative day zero, he returned
to the operating room for re-exploration. Please see operative
notes for surgical details. Once hemostasis was obtained, he
returned to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Blood pressure
was initially labile and given evidence of [**Male First Name (un) **] on
echocardiogram, inotropes were avoided with goal to maintain
preloa
