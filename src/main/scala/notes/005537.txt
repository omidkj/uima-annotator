History of Present Illness:
82 yo Vietnamese, but Cantonese speaking man with a history of
COPD and Pulm HTN on Home O2 (2L) who was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in [**11/2188**] for 4 years of progressively worsening dyspnea.
Since that visit the patient's dyspnea has progressed and now he
has dyspnea at rest and exertion and was placed on home 02.  CT
scan revealed calcified granulomas and concern for possible
smoldering infection such as Tb or [**Doctor First Name **] vs. sarcoid, chronic
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Fibrosing NSIP.  The patient was
referred to the [**Hospital **] clinic for evaluation of bronchoscopy, BAL
and biopsy.

Patient presented for elective bronchoscopy on [**2189-6-5**] and
procedure went well.  During recovery, he was noted to be
hypoxic to 83% on room air and tachycardic to the 120's.  CXR
LLL pulmonary edema, and given lasix 20mg IV, also given
solumedrol and nebulizers.  He improved to 88% on room air and
will be admitted to the ICU for overnight monitoring.

STUDIES
[**2189-6-5**]   Pathology Tissue: left lower lobe
.
[**2189-6-5**] POST-PROCEDURE CXR
Left lung has a decreased volume with large areas of
consolidations in the
left lower lobe and mediastinal shift to the left side. Multiple
other tiny opacities in the right lung and mild bronchiectasis
in the right middle lobe and right lower lung are present. No
pneumothorax or pleural effusion on the right side. All these
findings are better evaluated on a chest CT dated [**2189-1-8**]
which suggest multifocal consolidation and bronchiolitis and
bronchiectasis likely from infection. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2189-6-5**] INTERVAL CXR
TECHNIQUE: Single upright portable chest view was read in
comparison with the prior radiograph done on the same day five
hours apart.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Other findings including
left lower
lung consolidation, left lung volume loss, and multiple tiny
opacities in the right lung are all unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumothorax.
.
[**2189-6-6**] INTERVAL CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. The left lung remains diminished in overall volume with air
bronchograms and patchy opacity predominantly in the left mid
and lower lung. There are bullous changes at the left apex which
are stable. No pneumothorax is seen. The right lung demonstrates
some prominent interstitial markings suggestive of
bronchiectasis but the appearance does not appear to be
significantly changed since [**2189-6-5**]. No evidence of pulmonary
edema. Probable left pleural effusion versus chronic pleural
thickening. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
82M w/hx of obstructive and restrictive lung disease, admitted
after he developed hypoxia and tachycardia in the PACU after
outpatient scheduled bronchoscopy, found to have LLL congestion.
After overnight monitoring in the MICU, he was called out to the
floor.
.
HYPOXIA
Pt underwent scheduled outpatient bronchoscopy and LLL lung
biopsy for known pulmonary disease of unknown etiology
documented on recent CT chest. Has been using oxygen more over
the past few months - during exertion and when sleeping but not
at rest. His procedure was uncomplicated, but soon thereafter in
the PACU he was noted to be hypoxia, w/supplemental NC oxygen
requirement. There was concern for PTX, vascular congestion
and/or post-bronchoscopy inflammation. CXR showed LLL congestion
(no pre-procedure CXR for comparison). He was given lasix with
some improvement. Also received combivent nebs in the PACU and
overnight in the MICU. By the morning, he was breathing
comfortably w/O2 sat >95% on minimal supplemental O2 similar to
recent home O2 requirement. Multiple pending studies from the
bronchoscopy (micro, path) to be followed-up by outpatient
pulmonologist.

TACHYCARDIA
Pt tachycardic in the PACU coincident w/onset of hypoxia. Sinus
rhythm on telemetry. Thought to be [**3-12**] respiratory distress plus
significant albuterol received. EKG not suggestive of acute
cardiac issues.

COPD/BRONCHIECTASIS
Continued home meds: combivent and advair. No wheeze on exam.

HTN
Normotensive. Continued Lisinopril 40mg daily.

Hyperlipidemia
Continued home Simvastatin 20mg qHS.

GERD
Continued home Omeprazole
