HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female
with a history of metastatic breast cancer who was originally
admitted to [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **] on [**5-3**] with
complaints of diarrhea and fevers.  Of note, she had recently
completed (in [**2138-3-24**]) a course of Xeloda for right
axillary breast cancer recurrence.  At the outside hospital
she was initially treated with IV fluids.  On [**5-10**] CT scan
was done which showed dilated large and small bowel with
thickened colon wall.  She was started on a course of Cipro
and Flagyl on [**5-12**].  She was also started at this time on a
course of Vancomycin for empiric coverage of a right middle
lobe pneumonia that was seen on that CT scan.  On [**5-14**] the
patient started to spike temperatures and had increased
somnolence as well as increased diarrhea.  On [**5-17**] the
patient was desaturating to 60-70% and was subsequently
intubated.  She then became hypotensive requiring pressors.
Culture data from the outside hospital was notable for MRSA
in stool and sputum.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] MICU on [**2138-5-17**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Infectious Disease:  On admission the patient appeared
septic.  She was placed on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and
Flagyl to cover GI, lung, and line as possible sources.
Neo-Synephrine was weaned off within 24 hours with aggressive
volume resuscitation.  Follow-up abdominal CT on [**5-18**] was
consistent with enterocolitis and also showed a right lower
lobe pneumonia.  The patient completed a 14 day course of
Vancomycin on [**5-26**] for presumed MRSA pneumonia.  The
Levofloxacin and Flagyl were discontinued on [**5-21**] as the
patient's diarrhea was much improved.  On [**5-30**] a repeat CT
showed right lower lobe consolidation and the patient had an
increasing white blood cell count.  Vancomycin was restarted
at this time for a recurrent MRSA pneumonia.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was noted to have many PVCs
and some short runs of MSVT on telemetry in the MICU.
Lopressor was initiated and titrated up during the MICU
course with improvement in these findings.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated on [**5-17**] for
hypoxemic respiratory failure.  She underwent a very slow
wean from the ventilator and was eventually extubated on [**5-26**].
Post extubation she had some episodes of desaturation to the
80's which responded easily to suctioning.  She was therefore
monitored in the ICU for two days following these episodes
with no further episodes of hypoxia.

4.  GI:  The patient's enterocolitis was presumed to be
secondary to Xeloda toxicity (the patient was on a quite high
dose).  This diarrheal illness resolved in [**4-28**] days.
Following extubation, the patient was noted to have a weak
cough and gag reflex and was therefore high aspiration risk.
She was on TPN throughout the admission.

5.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine was 1.8 at admission and
had been as high as 2.4 at the outside hospital.  The
patient's baseline is unclear but the creatinine improved
during the hospital course to 1.1.

6.  Heme:  The patient had an elevated INR on admission which
corrected with Vitamin K.  During the admission the patient's
hematocrit drifted down to 23 and she was transfused one unit
of packed red blood cells on [**5-26**].

On [**5-31**] the patient was transferred to the regular floor from
the MICU.  At the time of transfer she denied any pain,
shortness of breath or discomfort.  However, at approximately
11:45 the patient was found in her room with no pulse and no
respirations.  The code team was called and CPR and ACLS
protocols were followed.  The code lasted approximately 25
minutes but the efforts were unsuccessful.  The patient was
pronounced dead at 12:15 a.m. on [**2138-6-1**].  The
appropriate family members were [**Name (NI) 653**] and the family has
agreed to an autopsy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.
