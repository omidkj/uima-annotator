Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old woman who presented with pulmonary edema from atrial
fibrillation, acute diastolic heart failure, and prolapsed and
regurgitant mitral valve. She initially presented with
progressive shortness of breath with chest x-ray read as
"multifocal pneumonia". She had leukocytosis, elevated lactate,
and tachycardia in the setting of "suspected recurrent
aspiration pneumonia". She tolerated BiPAP and did not require
intubation. She was recently admitted to the ICU with pneumonia;
The MICU staff treated her again with vancomycin, cefepime,
levofloxacin for suspected aspiration pneumonia. However, I
believe she had pulmonary edema and she appeared fluid
overloaded with jugular venous distension and peripheral edema
with very suggestive CXR of edema. Her atrial fibrillation was
rate controlled with increased doses of Diltiazem ( 90 MG Q 6
hours then 360 of Cardiazem CD; she could not swallow the latter
and therefore she was discharged on the short acting). Her
Coumadin was held for supra therapeutic INR and the rate was
controlled with digoxin and Diltiazem. She was then treated with
Coumadin and Heparin bridge as well as IV Lasix and her
antibiotics were stopped. She was found to have severe
esophageal narrowings by EGD (upper narrowing and GE narrowing
with dilated esophagus between) that made TEE difficult. MICU
team ordered TSH/CRP/RF/B12/folate/cortisol and were all normal.
They also ordered RUQ ultrasound. She tolerated thin liquids and
regular consistency solids without any overt or soft signs of
aspiration. She denied any pneumonia prior to these recent 2
episodes. She did not have symptoms consistant possible reflux
and aspiration and she was be advanced to thin liquids and
regular consistency solids. She did not undergo TEE with
cardioversion because of the severe esophageal narrowing. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] strongly cautioned against doing a TEE. Under
anesthesia, he could not pass a standard 8 mm scope. He had to
use an ultra-thin 4.5 mm scope, leave a wire, dilate up with
[**Last Name (un) 17407**] dilators to 12 mm.  Only then, he could pass his scope
over a wire-guide to do the injections (at the GEJ, 100 Units of
Botox was injected successfully in four quadrants into the LES).
The upper narrowing was most likely from an osteophyte and the
lower from achalasia (!?). She was asked to keep head of bed
elevated at 45 degrees at all times to minimize risk of
gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration and to avoid eating for 3
hours prior to sleep. In any case she did well and was
discharged home after she received adequate diuresis, good rate
control, and several days of antibiotics. She will need her
valve fixed SOON.
