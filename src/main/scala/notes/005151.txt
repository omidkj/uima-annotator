History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11622**] is a 50-year-old M with a h/o PAF (previously on
metoprolol), myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] (antibody positive ocular) on
prednisone and hypothyroidism, history of headache x 2 months
(on Advil), presented to PCP's office with 3 days of fevers as
high as 103 and a 2 weeks of constant headache. Patient has been
taking aspirin which brings down the fever, but then the fever
goes back up.  Headache is of a chronic nature and never really
resolved, he was seen in urgent care for his HA two weeks prior
to admission and given IM toradol with some relief.  He has had
some difficulty sleeping due to his headache.  He also notes
that he developed some loose stools yesterday, also complaining
of decreased po intake for the past few days.  He also denies
any nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, bloody stools, urinary
symptoms.  Denies any sore throat, ear pain, chest pain, sob,
cough, rashes.  He has no known sick contacts and has not had
any recent travel.  Reports no neck pain/stiffness, no focal
neurologic symptoms.
.
At his PCP's office, he was febrile to 102.9 and hypotensive to
92/61, labs showed a Cr of 1.7 from a baseline of 1.2 to 1.1 and
a white count of 14.1, urinalysis was positive for blood and
protein.  He was given tylenol and sent to the ER for further
evaluation.
.
In ED, initial vitals 100.3 90 125/73 16 97%.  His labs were
noteable for Creatinine of 1.5, Na of 132, WBC of 12.9.  He was
given Levofloxacin 750mg, Acetaminophen 1000mg.  He went into
afib w/ RVR to 160, was given Diltiazem IV 20, then PO 30.  He
had no response to 2L of NS so was started on a diltiazem gtt.
VS at 2:30am were 160s/AF, RR: 33, 99% 3L, 147/112.  EKG in the
ER was atrial fibrillation at 151bpm with TWI in III and aVF.
He then desaturated to 87% on 3LNC with a HR in the 160's, so he
underwent a CTA, which was negative for PE but confirmed the LLL
PNA that was seen on CXR.  As he still required a diltiazem gtt
he was admitted to the ICU, so his antibiotic coverage was
broadened to include ceftriaxone and he was started on liters 3
and 4 of normal saline.  VS on transfer were: 101.1, 120s,
154/90, 27, 93% on 6LNC.
.
In the ICU initial VS were: 99.7, 152, 125/87, 26, 89% on 6LNC.
He is currently complaining of some worsening shortness of
breath, but denies any palpitations, chest
pain/pressure/tightness, also says that his HA has improved.
.
Review of systems:

(-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies
sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain. Denies
dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.

Other pertinent labs:

Imaging:
.
CXR [**7-17**]: Left lower lobe pneumonia. Possible chronic bronchial
inflammation.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**7-18**]:
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect,
or
vascular territorial infarct. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in size and morphology. Midline structures are preserved.

Paranasal sinuses are well aerated; mild mucosal thickening is
noted in the ethmoid air cells and minimal fluid/mucosal
thickening in the sphenoid sinus.
Mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear, with
under-pneumatization noted on the right. Apparant mild proptosis
on the rigth side may be positional- correlate clinically.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Mild mucosal
thickening in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.
.
TTE [**7-18**]:

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Limited study. Mild global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction in the setting of significant tachycardia.
.
CTA chest [**7-18**]:
The visualized pulmonary vasculature shows no evidence of
filling defects to suggest pulmonary embolus. The aorta shows no
evidence of intramural hematoma or dissection. Heart and
pericardium are within normal limits. There are bilateral small
pleural effusions, left greater than right. Opacifications at
the left lung base with air bronchograms as well as small
opacification in the right lung base are consistent with
pneumonia. 8-mm opacification in the right lung (2,27) most
likely represents infectious process; howev
