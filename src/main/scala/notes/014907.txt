Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with 2 drug eluting stents to the
proximal left anterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 79 year old female who presented with CC of
CP. The patient was in her usual state of health when at 1240
she got up to answer the doorbell and on getting back developed
non-radiating [**2133-7-13**] CP with diaphoresis. She called the
ambulance and presented to the ED. En-route she got a 12-lead
EKG which revealed ST-elevations in V1-3, 1, AVL, AVR and
reciprocal changes in 2, 3, AVF and V4-6. In the ED she got ASA
and fentanyl which helped the pain. She denied any shortness of
breath or back pain or any preivous hx of CP/angina. She went to
the cath lab for primary PCI.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging
[**2135-2-15**]
Cardiac Catheterization
1. Anterior STEMI with thrombotic occlusion of the proximal LAD.

2. Severe LCX (distal OM) disease and totally occluded RCA.
3. Severe proximal right common iliac calcific stenosis.
4. Dual antiplatelet therapy for at least 12 months.
5. Successful treatment of the culprit lesion (90% in proximal
LAD and a
hazy 60% tandem stenosis) with deployment of a 3.0 x 12 mm and
2.5 x 8
mm Resolute stents in overlapped fashion leaving no residual
satenoses
in the treated segment.

[**2135-2-16**]
Echocardiogram
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25
%) secondary to akinesis of the apex, and distal segments of all
LV walls, and hypokinesis of the mid segments. The basal
segments are hyperdynamic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial-mild mitral
regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe focal and global left ventricular function
involving predominantly the mid-distal LV segments c/w Takotsubo
or ischemic cardiomyopathy (multivessel CAD). Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2135-2-15**]
ECG
Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is 200
milliseconds.
There is ST segment elevation in the anterior leads consistent
with acute
myocardial infarction. There are reciprocal changes in the
inferior and
anterolateral leads

[**2-20**] US:
FINDINGS: Targeted son[**Name (NI) **] was performed to the right groin in
the region of recent cardiac catheterization, demonstrating a 4
x 3.6 x 1.8 cm hematoma. Just medial to this, there is apparent
contiguity between the common femoral vein and proximal
superficial femoral artery, with arterialized venous flow in
this region, consistent with an arteriovenous fistula. No
pseudoaneurysm is demonstrated.

IMPRESSION:
1. Findings concerning for arteriovenous fistula between
proximal superficial femoral artery and common femoral vein.
2. Large right groin hematoma.

On Discharge:


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32296**] is a seventy nine year old woman with diabetes,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with a STEMI. She
received two drug eluting stents to the proximal LAD.

# Anterior STEMI s/p DES to pLAD: 79 year old female with
diabetes, but no cardiac history who was in her usual state of
health until around 12 PM on the day of admission when she
developed the acute onset of subseternal chest pain
EMS was called, and a 12 lead ECG demonstrated ST elevations in
I, avL, V1-V3, with ST depressions in II, III, aVF, V5-V6. The
patient was taken emergently to the cath lab where there was a
thrombotic appearing lesion in the proximal LAD prior to the
first diagonal, as well as a lesion in the distal LCx that was
not thought to be the culprit, and a totally occluded proximal
RCA with left to right collaterals. The patien
