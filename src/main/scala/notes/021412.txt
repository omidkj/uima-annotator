Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room on [**2153-8-15**] where
she underwent a CABG x 3, AVR and MVR. She was transferred to
the SICU in critical but stable condition. She received 1 units
PRBCs post op for an HCT of 25. She remained intubated
overnight. On post op day 1 she was found to have complete heart
block with juctional escape and she was paced with her
epicardial wires. She was followed closely by electrophysiology.
She was extubated on POD #2. She was started on nitroglycrine
and then nicardipine for hypertension and she was then
transitioned to PO antihypertensives. She continued to have a
high oxygen requirement and her work of breathing increased. She
was seen in consultation by interventional pulmonology who
determined that she was not stable enough at that point for a
bronchoscopy. She recevieved a permanent pacemaker ([**Company 1543**])
on [**2153-8-21**]. Given her respiratory distress and inability to lay
flat for the pacemaker she was reintubated.  She was started on
tube feeds through a DHT. Her ventilator was weaned again and
she was extubated on [**2153-8-22**]. She received a bedside swallowing
evaluation who recommended that she remain NPO and continue to
receive DHT feeds. She was reevaluated later during her stay who
recommended advancing her diet to soft solids and thin liquids,
with pills crushed iun applesauce, as well as continuing tube
feeds overnight to supplement her low PO intake. She had some
atrial fibrillation for which she received lopressor and
amiodarone and anticoagulation with heparin and coumadin. She
received a PICC line given some phlebitis and poor peropheral
access with need for IV heparin. Calorie coumts improved with
supplements, and her DHT was dc'd [**8-30**] prior to discharge.  She
was put on Keflex for her phlebitis.
