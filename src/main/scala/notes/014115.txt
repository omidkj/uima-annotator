Admission Date:  [**2132-3-23**]       Discharge Date: [**2132-4-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2064-5-11**]       Sex:  F

Service: Medicine
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for ALS, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen, recently admitted
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation on
[**2132-2-23**], responding to nebulizer admission with agonal
breathing at home.  Basic life support was called and found the
patient with a respiratory rate of 2, oxygen saturation of 20%.
The patient was taken by EMS, and placed on 100% oxygen, with the
patient subsequently with a respiratory rate of 40, and minimal
responsive.  The patient was intubated in the Emergency
Department.  On admission the patient was found to be in
supraventricular tachycardia.

The patient had been in her usual state of health on the morning
of admission as reported by her siblings.  Her children went to
get her food and found her as above when they returned.  Per the
Emergency Department, the decision to intubate the patient was
based on air movement, and the patient "looking fatigued."  No
arterial blood gas was obtained prior to intubation.

After intubation, the patient was noted to have paradoxical
breathing and required significant sedation to synchronize with
the rate.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
further management of her respiratory distress.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  ALS diagnosed in [**2122**].  The patient is
bedridden.  2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home
oxygen (no PFTs available).  3.  Atrial fibrillation diagnosed in
[**2131-8-22**].  4.  Anxiety.  5. Diverticulitis.  6.  Lung nodule,
which on [**2131-4-22**], was characterized as a right posterior lung
mass, 3.0 cm x 2.0 cm x 2.5 cm, consistent with a hamartomata.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Albuterol metered dose inhaler,
Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s., Amitriptyline Maxzide 1 tab p.o.
q.d., Combivent 4 puffs inhaled q.4 hours.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home.  Her grandchildren
help care for her.  The patient has a home health aid who comes
for one hour a day.  She has a remote history of tobacco use.  No
alcohol use.  The patient uses a motorized wheelchair.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 110/60,
heart rate 135, respirations 20, oxygen saturation 97% on
pressure support ventilation (pressure support of 10, PEEP of
5).  General:  The patient was an elderly female, lying on a
stretcher intubated.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
Pupils 2 mm bilaterally, nonreactive.  Neck:  Supple.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac.  Normal S1 and S2.  Lungs:
Poor air movement throughout.  Inspiratory to expiratory
ratio 1:4.  Left lower lobe crackles.  Abdomen:  Soft,
slightly distended.  Good bowel sounds in all four quadrants.
Extremities:  No edema.  Neurological:  The patient was
intubated and minimally sedated.  She was moving all four
extremities spontaneously.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 12.4, hematocrit
32.2, platelet count 693; sodium 141, potassium 6.2
(hemolyzed), chloride 103, bicarb 24, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6,
glucose 182; calcium 9.3, magnesium 2.1; CK 66; ABG after
intubation with pH of 7.33, pCO2 66, pO2 364 on the above
vent settings.

Chest x-ray showed hyperinflated, hyperaerated lungs,
endotracheal tube 4 cm above the carina, no infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 160 beats per
minute, normal axis, normal intervals, normal [**Last Name (LF) 1754**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
depression at 1 mm in V5, no change compared to
electrocardiogram from [**2132-2-23**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The impression was that this was a 67-year-old
female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and emphysema with ALS, history of atrial fibrillation,
presenting in respiratory distress status post intubation in the
Emergency Department.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient had poor air movement, wheezing,
hyperinflation, and respiratory failure with hypoxia.  The
patient had been recently admitted for a chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation responding to nebulizers,
steroids, and Levaquin.  The differential diagnosis on this
admission for this patient's respiratory failure was a recurrent
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare versus chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease aspiration secondary to mucous plug
or secondary to aspiration versus pulmonary embolism versus flash
pulmonary edema secondary to rapid heart rate.

CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism.  An
echocardiogram was done to evaluate for congestive heart failure
exacerbating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55% and no mitral
regurgitation.  There was no evidence of pneumonia or congestive
heart failure during the MICU stay.  The trigger of this
patient's acute respiratory failure was uncertain.  The patient
was treated with steroids (Solu-Medrol switched to Prednisone
with taper), Levaquin and Flagyl for a question of aspiration
pneumonia, for a total of a 10-day course, Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers, and diuresis to maintain the patient euvolemic.

The patient was initially intubated with high-pressure support
and noted to have auto-PEEP with a slow long wean to extubation.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient's respiratory status was
stable.  The patient required an oxygen requirement of [**2-24**] L
nasal cannula during the hospital stay after transfer out of the
MICU.  The patient was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizer therapy.

2.  Right lung mass:  The patient had a right lung mass
suspicious for cancer.  A CT scan of the chest was done on this
admission showing a right lower lobe lung mass, 3 cm x 3 cm x 3
cm in dimension, with speckled calcification.  There was also
mediastinal and paratracheal lymphadenopathy raising the
suspicion for cancer.  On comparison with a chest CT done at the
[**Hospital6 1708**] in [**2130-7-22**], the mass was larger,
and the adenopathy was new.

A Pulmonary consult was obtained with bronchoscopy and biopsy of
the paratracheal lymph node.  Final pathology of the specimen is
pending.

3.  Cardiac:  The patient had an episode of atrial tachycardia on
admission to the Intensive Care Unit which had been well
controlled on Diltiazem which was titrated up to 90 mg p.o. q.6
hours.  Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was switched to
Cardizem CD 360 mg p.o. q.d., and then titrated up further to 480
p.o. q.d.  The patient was monitored on telemetry for the
duration of her stay on the floor.  The patient did not require
intravenous Diltiazem for interim episodes of atrial tachycardia.

4.  Hematology:  In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a
hematocrit drop from 28 to 22.  The etiology of this hematocrit
drop was unclear.  The patient had a history of diverticulitis.
The patient was transfused 2 U of packed red blood cells.
Hematocrit was stable for the remainder of the hospital stay.

5.  Neurologic:  The patient had a reported history of ALS
diagnosed at the [**Hospital6 1708**].  The patient was
reevaluated by the Neuromuscular Service on this admission, and
their impression was that the patient did not have ALS.  The
patient was restarted on Trazodone and Amitriptyline for
depression upon transfer back to the floor.

On [**4-3**], the patient was found unresponsive by the nursing
staff in the morning.  It was uncertain if the patient was having
any seizure activity before this episode.  Upon finding the
patient unresponsive, the patient was placed back in bed and was
described by the nurses as being unresponsive and "floppy."  By
the time she was examined by the medical team, the patient was
back to her baseline.  An arterial blood gas was checked showing
a pH of 7.42, pCO2 57, pO2 246 on 5 L nasal cannula oxygen.  The
patient's baseline CO2 is in the 60s.  The patient's heart rate
was 108, and an electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.  The
etiology of this acute unresponsiveness was unclear.

As the patient had a right lung mass suspicious for cancer, an
MRI of the head w
