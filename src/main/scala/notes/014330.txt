Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Confusion/agitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
89 M with CAD and pafib presented from home with MS change. He
sustained a mechanical fall in [**Month (only) 404**] and was discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] to rehab on [**2194-2-6**]. At that time, notes already suggests
that he had some confusion. I talked to the daughter this
evening and she reports that he was intermittently confused at
rehab as well. The family took the patient home five days ago
and then brought him to the ED for ongoing and worsening
confusion and agitation.
.
In the ED, a CT head was ordered but he was unable to cooperate
so he was sedated and intubated for the study. He was obtunded
after the study and was tranferred to the MICU because there was
difficulty extubating him.
.
In the MICU, there was a concern for acute stroke since his
pupils were noted to be unequal. The stroke team was called and
MRI/MRA was done that did not show acute stroke. Apparently, his
unequal pupils are not new.
.
The cause of his mental status change was unclear. The thought
at this time is toxic metabolic, which Neuro agrees with. There
was a question of seizure in the MICU but EEG was unrevealing.
LP was done and did not show infection.
.
Currently he is still agitated and the daughter notes a waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course.

Pertinent Studies:

[**2194-3-27**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST [**2194-3-28**] 5:13 AM
BRAIN MRI:
There is no acute infarct identified. There is no midline shift,
mass effect, or hydrocephalus. There is moderate
ventriculomegaly and prominence of sulci including prominence of
temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] which has increased since the previous MRI of
[**2191-4-5**]. These findings would indicate brain and medial temporal
atrophy. There are mild-to-moderate changes of small vessel
disease in the periventricular white matter. No evidence of
chronic blood products identified in the brain.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct. Moderate brain and
medial temporal atrophy. The medial temporal atrophy has
progressed since the previous MRI.

MRA OF THE NECK:
Neck MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the carotid and
vertebral arteries. The right vertebral artery origin is not
well seen due to technical reasons. Otherwise, both vertebral
and carotid arteries demonstrate normal flow signal. On
fat-suppressed images, no evidence of fat suppression is seen.

IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the neck.

MRA OF THE HEAD:
Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation. No evidence of vascular
occlusion or stenosis is seen. The left posterior cerebral
artery is fetal in origin, a normal variation. Distal left
vertebral artery is small in size which is a normal variation.
Slight narrowing in the distal left vertebral artery on
post-contrast images could not be confirmed on 3D images of the
head and could be artifactual.

IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2194-4-4**] 1:04 PM
OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOW: An oropharyngeal
swallow evaluation was performed in conjunction with the speech
and swallow pathology division. This demonstrated mild to
moderately reduced bolus formation and control with premature
spillage consistently noted. Once swallow was initiated,
laryngeal elevation, valve closure, and epiglottic deflection
were within functional limits. No episodes of penetration or
aspiration were noted.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2194-4-2**] 1:03 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-27**], the endotracheal
tube has been removed. There is again opacification at the left
base consistent with pleural effusion and underlying
atelectasis. The possibility of aspiration pneumonia cannot be
excluded without a lateral view. The right lung is essentially
clear with mild atelectatic changes at the bases.


Brief Hospital Course:
89 M, [**Location 7972**] Creole only speaking, admitted for confusion
and found to have MRSA UTI and pneumonia.  Patient was initially
admitted to the MICU after being intubated and sedated for
agitation as in HPI. Briefly, he was delirious and required
intubation for airway protection and to undergo imaging studies
and LP safely. He was initially difficult to ween and eventually
was weened and transferred to the floor. Hospital course
outlined by problem below:

# Delirium/agitation:
The patient was admitted in a severely confused and agitated
state. He had an extensive workup for delirium, all of which was
unrevealing. CT head was negative. MRI/MRA head was negative.
EEG was abnormal due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy (likely
infection, metabolic, but workup was initially negative). Lumbar
puncture was negative, and CSF culture was negative.

He was transferred to the floor, where he was still severely
agitated nightly. Repeat UA was positive for MRSA UTI, and CXR
showed left sided atelectasis vs. pneumonia. He was placed on
Vanco/Levo for UTI and aspiration pneumonia coverage. After
antibiotics were started, his delirium dramatically improved,
but he was still moderately agitated. He required soft
restraints for agitation and protection of the patient himself
and for the staff (he was hitting and scratching staff and
pulling out foley and IVs).

Making the delirium worse is
