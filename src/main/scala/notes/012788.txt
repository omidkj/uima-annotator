Pertinent Results:
[**2177-5-7**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No
thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve is bicuspid
with a horizontal commissure. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: A bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position.
The valve is well seated and the leaflets appear to be normally
mobile. Two small paravalvular leaks were seen after initial
separation from bypass but are no longer seen after
administration of protamine. The peak gradient across the aortic
valve is 14mmHg and the mean gradient is 7mmHg with a CO of
3.7L/min. There is no AI. The MR appears to be trace. The LV
systolic function remains normal. There is no evidence of aortic
dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12598**] was as same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On [**2177-5-7**] he was brought
directly to the operating room where he underwent an aortic
valve replacement. Please see operative note for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated without
incident. On post-op day one he was started on beta-blockers and
diuretics. He was then transferred to the step-down floor for
further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. He did have a small-moderate right
pneumothorax seen on CXR after chest tubes were pulled and this
was stable on subsequent chest x-rays.  He remained stable from
a respiratory status saturating 95-100% on room air.  On
postoperative day three, he went into rapid atrial fibrillation
and converted back to normal sinus rhythm after receiving
Amiodarone.  Over the next several days, he continued to make
clinical improvements and transitioned to PO Amiodarone. He
remained in a normal sinus rhythm and no further episodes of
atrial fibrillation were noted. He was medically cleared for
discharge to home with VNA services on postoperative day five.
At discharge, his blood pressure was 124/74, with regular heart
rate of 64 beats per minute with oxygen saturations of 99% on
room air. Discharge chest x-ray showed persistent small right
apical pneumothorax - which was stable.  This will be monitored
with repeat CXR next week prior to wound check on [**5-20**].  All
follow up instructions were scheduled and advised.
