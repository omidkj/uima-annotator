Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
African-American female with a history of congestive heart
failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who
presented with one week of shortness of breath.

The patient was an extremely poor historian largely secondary
to her shortness of breath.  The patient denies any fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or chest pain.  The
patient has had coughing attacks that leave her out of
breath.  At baseline, the patient uses three liters of oxygen
at home and can only walk around the house but cannot walk up
stairs.  The patient denies any sick contacts or loss of
consciousness.

Over the past two days, she has experienced increasing
worsening night sweats (waking up at 3 a.m. to 4 a.m.) in
addition to a decreased appetite.  The patient also has sleep
apnea and uses a continuous positive airway pressure machine
at night.

Her last admission at [**Hospital1 69**]
was in [**2177-10-8**] when she was given Lasix for mild
bilateral pulmonary edema and azithromycin for pneumonia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Congestive heart failure (last echocardiogram on [**2179-9-28**] revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 60%
with moderate aortic stenosis).
 2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (last pulmonary
function tests in [**2176-5-7**] revealed an FVC of 68%, FEV1
of 74%, and an FEV1:FVC ratio of 109%).
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Diabetes.
 5.  Hyperlipidemia.
 6.  Gout.
 7.  Osteoarthritis.
 8.  Coronary artery disease; last cardiac catheterization in
[**2178-1-8**] showed patent right coronary artery stent
with mild disease and mild atrial fibrillation.
 9.  Sleep apnea; the patient uses a continuous positive
airway pressure at night.
10.  Status post bilateral cataract surgery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications as an outpatient
included)
1.  Lasix 120 mg p.o. once per day.
2.  Norvasc 10 mg p.o. once per day.
3.  Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. three times per day.
4.  Isordil 10 mg p.o. three times per day.
5.  Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. once per day.
6.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once per day.
7.  Insulin with insulin sliding-scale.
8.  Albuterol nebulizers three times per day.
9.  Prednisone taper.

ALLERGIES:  BETA BLOCKER MEDICATIONS (lead to bradycardia)
and MEVACOR (leads to numerous side effects).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any tobacco or alcohol
use.  She lives [**Location (un) 6409**] with her daughter.

CODE STATUS:  At the time of admission the patient was full
code.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed heart rate was 81, blood pressure was 150/81,
respiratory rate was 22, and oxygen saturation was 91% on
three liters via nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was
an elderly and moderately obese female in respiratory
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed cloudy sclerae.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.   Cardiovascular
examination revealed distant heart sounds.  A 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur heard best at the best.  Lung examination
revealed diffuse coarse wet sounds with rhonchi and crackles
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, mildly distended, and
nontender.  Normal active bowel sounds.  Extremity
examination revealed bilateral 2+ pitting edema in the lower
legs.  Bilateral radial pulses were 2+.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   White blood
cell count was 12.4 (with differential of 87% neutrophils and
8% lymphocytes), hematocrit was 38.9, and platelets were 243.
Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 138, potassium was 5,
chloride was 102, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen was
33, creatinine was 1.4, and blood glucose was 147.  Creatine
kinase number one was 100.  Creatine kinase number two was
70.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
sinus rhythm with left axis deviation.  A left bundle-branch
block.  No major change from [**2179-10-8**]
electrocardiogram.

A chest x-ray showed left lower lobe collapse/consolidation
and mild congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was started on
a prednisone taper for her chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  She was also prescribed levofloxacin for a presumed
pneumonia.

While on the floor, the patient was also treated for
congestive heart failure exacerbation with 60 mg of Lasix
intravenously twice per day.  She was noted to be tachycardic
up to the 160s, but then bottomed out in response to
Lopressor.  The patient was felt to have a tachy-brady
syndrome.

Electrophysiology was consulted at this time.  A repeat
echocardiogram was also performed, and this showed an
ejection fraction of less than 20% with mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy and severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis.  This was a marked decrease in function from the
echocardiogram in [**2178**].

Because of the tachy-brady syndrome, the patient received a
DDI pacemaker.  During the pacemaker placement the patient
developed atrial flutter and was shocked with 200 joules
which resulted in a normal sinus rhythm.  She then became
disoriented.  She was started on Coumadin, digoxin, and
quinidine.  She then developed episodes of desaturations to
80% while off [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure.

At this point, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit.  In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient
was hypoxic without clear reason.  She was intubated for
continued hypoxia.  Overall, the patient was thought to be
hypoxic either from ongoing congestive heart failure or
atelectasis.  The patient was also aggressively diuresed with
Lasix and then Natrecor.  She did develop acute renal failure
with a bump in her creatinine to 2.9.

The patient's hypoxia was further worked up with a chest
computed tomography which showed excessive collapse of the
bronchus intermedius consistent with bronchomalacia in
addition to left lower lobe with bronchus collapse.  She was
also noted to have multifocal patchy consolidation and ground
glass in both upper lobes.  A flexible bronchoscopy revealed
marked collapse.

The differential diagnosis at that point included neoplasm,
infection, and chronic fibrosis which would have been
consistent with her previously restrictive pulmonary function
tests patterns.

The rest of the Medical Intensive Care Unit course was most
significant for an inability to wean the patient off the
ventilator.  The patient failed a pressure support trial.  A
family meeting was held, and the family was informed that the
patient would not tolerate weaning and that further options
included an tracheostomy versus comfort measures only with
extubation.  The overall family consensus was to make the
patient comfort measures only and extubate her.  This was
done, and the patient expired 12 minutes after extubation.
