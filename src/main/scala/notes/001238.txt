Allergies:
Aspirin / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement
PEG tube placement/Upper Endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
73 year-old man with a mechanical aortic valve and atrial
fibrillation, on coumadin and plavix, recent CVA of unclear
type, and prostate cancer. He was admitted [**11-4**] to an OSH with
lightheadeness and CT showed L parietal IPH of 2.6 cm. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neursurgical evaluation.

At [**Hospital1 **], neurosurgery did not think any surgical intervention was
needed. Anticoagulation was reversed with FFP and he was
admitted to the ICU.

In the ICU, CXR suggested likely aspiration pneumonitis, but
given low-grade fevers blood cultures were drawn and Unasyn
started. Repeat CT showed unchanged hematoma with surrounding
vasogenic edema but no obvious underlying mass. Neurosurgery
continued to follow and recommended only neuro checks every 4
hours. They recommended starting lovenox 2 weeks after the bleed
event and follow-up repeat CT scan 2 days after with follow up
in Dr.[**Name (NI) 935**] clinic 1 month after the bleed. They agreed with
starting subcutaneous heparin immediately.

Past Medical History:
- Aortic insufficiency and root dilation secondary to rheumatic
fever, left ventricular outflow tract reconstruction including a
mechanical aortic valve and a biosynthetic aortic root graft at
[**Hospital1 2025**] [**2127**]
- CHF (details unknown)
- Type II Diabetes, on metformin at home
- Atrial Fibrillation, on coumadin at home
- R Frontal CVA [**2148-9-3**] (hospitalized at [**Hospital **]
Hospital); discharged from rehab early [**Month (only) 359**]. Residual
swallowing difficultly, L UE and LE weakness. Unclear if embolic
vs. hemorrhagic.
- Prostate cancer, s/p prostatectomy
- Diverticulitis, s/p resection
- R shoulder surgery, details unknown

Social History:
Living with girlfriend [**Name (NI) 3551**] (rents room from her, also lived
with her prior to the stroke). She helps him climb stairs and
generally requires full care at home since his stroke. Has
nursing and PT/OT and speech VNAs at home. No alcohol,

strength exam, but appears symmetric - best exam currently [**4-7**]
in elbow flex, extend, wrist extend, and grip in UEs and
generally symmetric; 4-/5 in L dorsi and plantarflexion and [**4-7**]

STUDIES:
CT head [**11-4**]: Large focus of intraparenchymal blood with
surrounding edema in the left parieto-occipital area. Comments
regarding evolution of this finding are not possible without the
comparison study. These findings raise the possibility of an
underlying mass (mets, primary or vascular malformation) which
would be better assessed with MRI.

CXR at OSH: Mild cardiomegaly. Valve prosthesis. Mild vascular
congestion. Ill defined L basilar density - small pleural
effusion or infiltrate/atelectasis of LLL.

ECG [**11-5**]: regular atrial rhythm with frequent PACs (overall rate
90) ?sinus with somewhat unusual P wave axis. LAD/LAFB. no
significant change compared to old.

L Rib films [**11-8**]: no fracture or metastates

CT TORSO [**11-8**]:

CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post aortic
valve and aortic root replacement. The descending thoracic aorta
is measures up to 4.3 cm in diameter. There is trace pericardial
fluid. Mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 10 mm. The central
pulmonary arteries opacify normally. The airways are patent
bilaterally to the subsegmental level.
There is bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right.
High-density
material within the left lower lobe is likely related to
aspiration from the recent modified barium swallow. There is
fluid within the left lower lobe bronchus. The nasogastric tube
courses through the esophagus to terminate in the stomach. There
are no focal pulmonary masses or nodules.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV AND ORAL CONTRAST: There is a large
wedge-shaped filling defect of the spleen with a small amount of
perisplenic fluid. Fluid extends into the left paracolic gutter.
Small hypodense lesions in the liver, too small to characterize,
measure up to 11 mm in diameter are identified. The gallbladder,
pancreas and adrenals are There is a wedge-shaped defect in the
right kidney, concerning for infarct. A left renal cyst arising
from the interpolar region measures 5.9 cm in diameter. Surgical
clips at the gastroesophageal junction, result in streak
artifact at this level.
There is hypodense lesion in the midline anterior mesentery
(image 102 of
series 2) closely associated with the mesenteric vessels. This
is of
uncertain etiology. The stomach, small bowel and colon are
normal in caliber. There is no pneumatosis. There is evidence of
prior bowel surgery with the anastomosis in the midline abdomen
and a distal colonic anastomosis in the pelvis.
The psoas muscles are symmetric, without evidence of abscess.
The abdominal aorta is tortuous with atherosclerotic
calcifications that extend into the iliac arteries.

CT PELVIS WITH IV AND ORAL CONTRAST: There is gas in the
non-dependent
portion of the urinary bladder. A left inguinal hernia contains
nondilated
bowel. There a
