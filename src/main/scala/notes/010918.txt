FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Peripheral artery disease.
2. Successful PTA and stenting of the RSFA with a 8.0x60mm
Zilver stent
that was postdilated with a 6.0x20mm Viatrac balloon. Final
angiography
revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection
and good distal flow (see PTA comments).
3. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.

Radiology Report	CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2176-2-29**]
3:40 PM
PRELIMINARY REPORT
Large subcutaneous hematoma extending from the left groin access
site
inferiorly to the superior medial thigh, and superiorly to the
left iliac
crest. No retroperitoneal blood

Radiology Report	FEMORAL VASCULAR US LEFT	Study Date of [**2176-3-1**]
9:06 AM
No pseudoaneurysm identified in the left groin. A limited
examination was performed due to the large infiltrative hematoma
in the left
groin. No discrete collection identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13469**] is an 80 year old male with history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, CAD, diabetes, who presented for elective
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting of right
superficial femoral artery, complicated by large hematoma
requiring ICU monitoring.

# Left Groin Hematoma:
Patient was transfused two units of pRBCs, after which his
hematocrit remained stable.  His coumadin was held in the
setting of bleed, but his aspirin and plavix were continued in
the setting of recent stenting. Left groin ultrasound ruled out
aneurysm and AV fistula, and noncontrast CT scan ruled out
retroperitoneal bleed. CT scan showed extent of large hematoma
in subcutaneous tissue.

# Peripheral Vascular Disease:
Right Superficial Femoral Artery was successfully stented by
Interventional Cardiology. The patient was noted to have
complication of large left hematoma at the site of entry for the
procedure.  After the procedure, the patient's right foot was
noted to have strong dorsalis pedis pulse and was warm, well
perfused, while the left foot felt colder in comparison with
dopplerable pulses.
.
# Hypertension:
Home dose of metoprolol was held overnight in order to monitor
hemodynamic status more effectively and in setting of
bradycardia with ventricular rates in 50s; metoprolol was
restarted prior to discharge.  Patient may benefit from an ACE
inhibitor for renal and cardiac protection in the setting of
diabetes and heart disease if there are no contraindications to
its use in him.
.
# Hyperlipidemia:
Lipid panel was last checked in the [**Hospital1 18**] system in [**2163**], and
lipids appear to have been well controlled at that time.
Patient was continued on home dose atorvastatin during this
hospitalization.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease:
Patient was continued on aspiring, plavix, statin.  His
metoprolol was held overnight to monitor his hemodynamic status
and was restarted prior to discharge.
.

# Chronic renal insufficiency:
Patient presumed to have chronic renal insufficiency because
creatinine in [**2163**] in [**Hospital1 18**] system was 1.2, though patient may
have had acute issue at that time elevating creatinine; current
baseline renal function unclear. Creatinine 1.4 prior to
angiography, stable at 1.3 prior to discharge.  Creatinine
should be closely monitored after contrast load for procedure in
the setting of renal insufficiency.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus:
Patient's metformin was held during hospitalization and is to be
restarted the day after discharge.  His blood sugars were
monitored, and he was placed on an insulin sliding scale during
this hospitalization.
.
# Atrail Fibrillation:
Patient is on coumadin at home, which was held overnight in the
setting of bleed and restarted the next day when hematoma was
found to be stable.  Patient remained in slow atrial
fibrillation, rates in 50s during this hospitalization, likely
with some vagal response from groin hematoma.  Metoprolol was
held in the setting of already slow rate.

.
# COPD:
Home Advair was continued.
.
# Gout:
Patient was continued on home dose allopurinol.
