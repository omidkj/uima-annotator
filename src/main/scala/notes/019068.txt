Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted yesterday with worsening right foot
infection after a traumatic injury 2 weeks ago. On exam her
lateral aspect of the right 4th and 5th toes had a large area of
ulceration with fibrinous exudate and some necrotic area
extending to the plantar surface. Based on the extension of the
lesion and the risks of progressive infection of the foot a
procedure in the operating room was decided to be the most
adequate management. As the patient did not agree to undergo an
amputation of the 5th toe in case this was felt to be necessary
in the OR, an incision and drainage of the wound was performed.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and specimen was sent for
cultures and pathology. Her preoperative blood sugars were in
the 350s, therefore insulin by sliding scale was infused with
improved blood sugar control post-surgery. Patient strongly felt
that she would like to be transferred to Rode Island, and be
managed by her podiatrist [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 30696**] DPM at the [**Hospital 30697**], so arrangements were done and patient will be
transferred stable post incision and drainage to that
institution for further management.  A vac wound care system was
placed on her right foot and changed after three days.  Vac was
replaced and patient was discharged home with home vac wound
care supplies.  Patient continued on abx as an outpatient.
