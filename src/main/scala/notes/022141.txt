EKG:  sinus tach with LVH changes but no acute ST-T changes

CT Angiogram
1. No pulmonary embolism to the level of segmental pulmonary
arteries as clinically questioned.
2. Patchy opacity at the lower left lingula may represent
infectious process versus a neoplastic process.
3. Mottled appearance of the bones is compatible with either
multiple myeloma or metastatic disease. Multiple rib fractures
are present, correlate with evidence of pain to suggest an acute
fracture.
4. Cardiomegaly.
5. Pulmonary hypertension.
6. Lymphadenopathy in the lower neck and right paratracheal
region, again consistent with either infectious or neoplastic
process.
7. Coronary artery disease.

Hospitalization Course Labs/Studies:

ECHO [**7-24**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic root is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**11-26**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension
.
Bubble Study [**7-31**]:   No right-to-left shunting of agitated saline
was identified at rest or with cough.
.
CT chest/abd/pelv [**8-4**]:
1. Small rounded opacity measuring 1.2 cm in the right lower
lobe. This could represent some residual rounded atelectasis or
a focal rounded pneumonia. Clinical correlation is recommended.
2. Right thyroid lobe nodule.
3. Distended stomach.
4. Lytic areas throughout the osseous structures. This could
represent renal osteodystrophy. Multiple myeloma and metastatic
disease cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 y.o man with ESRD, HTN, CAD p/w acute SOB and hypoxia, likely
related to obstructive disease given respiratory acidosis with
chronic compensation vs aspiration PNA.  Pt had two episodes of
hypotension likely due to oversedation with propofol, although
cardiac component cannot be ruled out given hyperdynamic heart
function.  Ruled out for PE by CTA, MI didn't seem likely cause
of hypotension given clinical picture.

1) Hypoxic, Hypercarbic Respiratory failure.  Pt intubated on
assist-control. Weaned to pressure support and then extubated.
Txf to floor on supp. O2 c stable hemodynamics and good resp.
status.  On floor, pt. desat and became tachycardic when sat
upright for feeding - was transfered to MICU where resp. status
improved.  Txf back to floor - similar episode of desat c
position + ABG c/w resp. acidosis - pt. txf back to MICU for
CPAP c PS.  Pt. alternated in MICU between CPAP c PS
