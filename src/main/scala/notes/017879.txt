History of Present Illness:
This is a 67 year-old female with ESRD s/p failed cadaveric
renal tx on HD, recent admission for line sepsis, CAD, dCHF, hx
PE, who presented to the ED with fevers and rigors and is
transferred to the MICU for hypotension/concern for sepsis in
the setting of HD.
.
Her recent history is notably for being hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**]
from [**Date range (1) 12089**] with fevers and culture negative sepsis presumed
to be due to a line infection for which her HD catheter was
removed and replaced. She had a TTE which did not show any
evidence of endocarditis, and as nothing ever grew from her
cultures, she was discharged after completing 2 week course of
Vancomycin, stopping on 6/31.
.
On arrival to ED initial VS: 99 102 240/92 20 94% with 2 L, she
was actively rigoring with rectal temp of 104, she reported some
dyspnea then in setting of fever. Initially very hypertensive
but CXR witout fluid overload. Blood cultures were drawn and she
was given a dose of vanc/zosyn. She had no possible peripheral
access. Given SVC syndrome, attempts at RIJ placement were
unsuccessful, as pt has L tunned HD catheter, a femoral line was
placed. She was also given tylenol, zofran and 1L NS with
improvement in her symtoms. She had 1 episode of bilious
vomiting, but no abd tenderness on exam. No localizing symptoms
for infection. CXR suggested retrocardiac opacity, pt pt without
SOB, cough, hypoxia. A viral NOS/flu syndrome was suspected, pt
was admitted on droplet precautions for flu r/o. She does make a
small amount of urine, but not enough to send for culture in ED.
Here CBC was unremarkable with a WBC of 8.2. She had a trop of
0.11, during last hospitalization wsa 0.8. Elevated K 5.8. LFTs
normal. INR 1.9 on coumadin.
.
On the floor, she was awake and alert and noted to be rigoring,
temp 101.9, and complaining of low back pain, chronic for her
but more severe than usual. She had a recent sick contact, and
for the past several days had been having cold symptoms with
productive cough and shortness of breath. Her daughter also
stated she had been complaining of a right sided headache,
although she denied this at the time of interview. She was given
2mg of morphine and became more somnolent and nauseous but
stated that her pain was better controlled. Per her daughter she
had started rigoring at 9pm; the family initially assumed she
was hypoglycemic and gave her [**Location (un) 2452**] juice before coming to the
ED.
.
She was undergoing HD on the morning of transfer had became
hypotensive with BP in the 80s. No fluid was removed and she was
given 300cc. Purulent material was noted to be weeping from her
HD line and she was also tachypneic. She was then transferred to
the MICU for further management.
.
On presentation, she was alert and oriented and c/o of lower
abdominal pain which was relieved by a BM. She proceeded to have
two other BMs of liquidy brown stool. She denied SOB/CP but
appeared uncomfortably, grunting with breaths.

EKG [**6-26**]
Sinus tachycardia. Baseline artifact. Incomplete right
bundle-branch block
and non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2175-5-16**] anterolateral ST-T wave changes are
not seen on the current tracing and the rate has increased
substantially. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Echo [**2175-6-28**]
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild to moderate
([**11-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. Mild to moderate
aortic regurgitation.

EKG [**7-2**]
Probable ectopic atrial rhythm. Deep T wave inversions in the
anterolateral leads suggesting an extensive myocardial
infarction. Very minimal ST segment elevation in leads V1-V2.
Compared to tracing #1 no significant change.

CT [**7-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Filling defects consistent with thrombi versus fibrin sheath
(from prior catheter) in the superior vena cava and l
