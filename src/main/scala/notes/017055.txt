Tibia/Fibula xray [**2191-5-29**] (admission)
IMPRESSION: Displaced fractures of the mid shafts of the right
tibia and
fibula.


CT ABD/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval worsening of diffuse bilateral ground-glass
opacities in the
lungs, with more focal consolidations at the bilateral bases.
This is
consistent with evolving ARDS, with superimposed multifocal
pneumonia. Given the location, aspiration should be considered.
Fat emboli are also a
consideration given the history of trauma and fracture.

2. Persistent linear low-attenuation focus at the dome of the
left lobe of
the liver, with interval development of a small sliver of
slightly hyperdense perihepatic fluid. Findings are most
suggestive of a small grade 1 liver laceration. Mild
heterogeneity at posterior margin of segment 7, may represent
contusion.

3. Diffuse soft tissue edema, with new periportal edema,
suggests fluid
overload.

4. No evidence for mesenteric or bowel injury.

5. Small amount free fluid in pelvis.


Pathology Examination
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: bone right leg.
Procedure date     Tissue received     Report Date    Diagnosed
by
[**2191-6-7**] [**2191-6-7**] [**2191-6-10**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. FU/dsj??????
DIAGNOSIS:
Bone, right leg:
1.  Fragment of bone with focal osteonecrosis and fibrin. No
chronic or acute inflammation seen.
2.  Special stains  including Gram, GMS and PAS are negative
with satisfactory controls.
Clinical: Infected right tibia.
Gross: The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's
name, "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 35832**]", the medical record number and
additionally labeled "bone right leg". It consists of multiple
fragments of tan-pink bone measuring in aggregate 0.5 x 0.4 x
0.3 cm. They are entirely submitted in A for decalcification.


Brief Hospital Course:
#1 Tib/Fib fracture: Ms. [**Known lastname 35832**] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2191-5-29**] via transfer from [**Hospital **] Hospital with an open right
tibia fracture. She was taken to the trauma ICU for close
monitoring.  She was evaluated by the orthopaedic and trauma
surgery service, admitted, consented, and prepped for surgery.
She was taken to the operating room and underwent an I&D of her
right open tibia fracture with IM nail placement and VAC
closure. On [**6-2**] she underwent local debridement and irrigation
and a VAC dressing change and again was taken back to the
operating room on [**6-13**] debridement open fracture down to and
inclusive of bone with application of VAC sponge. She tolerated
all procedures well. Lovenox injections were later started.

#2 Hypoxia: On HD #3 while on the regular nursing unit she was
noted with worsening hypoxia requiring intubation. CT cuts of
lower lungs revealed multifocal pneumonia.  Increasing O2
requirement, worsening symptoms despite treatment with
azithromycin then levofloxacin for CAP, and CXR appearance
suggested ARDS-like picture.  Antibiotic coverage broadened to
vanc/zosyn to cover HAP or aspiration PNA given rapidly
progressive changes on CT. She was ventilated with low-tidal
volumes for ARDS with fentanyl/versed for sedation.  CTA
negative for PE.  Bronch showed blood-tinged fluid without
evidence of frank hemorrhage or purulent material.  Sputum and
blood cultures were sent.
.
#3 Hypotension: She was hypotensive in setting of positive
pressure on vent as well as sedation.  There was concern for
sepsis in setting of infection; cardiogenic etiologies
considered less likely as TTE was without evidence of depressed
EF or wall motion abnormality (although could develop RV
dysfunction with fat emboli from long bone fracture). Patient
was without evidence of continued blood loss.  IVF were given to
maintain MAP >60. She transiently required pressors (Levophed).
Sepsis was treated with antibiotic as above.
.
#4 Anemia: Hct 36 on admission, nadir value was 22 on POD#3
thought to be due to post-op fluid shifts.  She received 3 u
PRBC and Hct increased to 26.  Normal bilirubin not suggestive
of hemolysis.
.
#5 Fevers: Patient with Tmax 102 on POD#4, coinciding with
multilobar pneumonia seen on chest CT.  Surgical wounds appeared
clean.  LENI's did not reveal DVT.  She was treated with
vanc/zosyn for pneumonia and fever curve improved.

She remained in the trauma ICU for several days and was
eventually weaned and extubated and was transferred to the
regular nursing unit. Her oxygen saturations have been stable on
room air. She is on a regular diet and tolerating this; her pain
is well controlled with oral narcotics. She was evaluated by
Physical and Occupational therapy and recommended for acute
rehab.
