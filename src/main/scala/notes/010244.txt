Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
transfer to unit, line placed

History of Present Illness:
80M CAD s/p CABG [**2120**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA, SVG to LCX),
ischemic CM/CHF with EF 35%, chronic afib (on coumadin) s/p PPM
(infected wire [**2120**], revised and reinserted on left in [**2122**]),
initially admitted to OSH [**2-4**] for LLL PNA, treated with
levofloxacin.  He was readmitted [**3-7**] with ? cellulitis RUE
related to IV site and found to have MSSA bacteremia, treated
with IV PCN x 4 weeks.   He did well until [**2133-6-14**] when he
developed F/C at home.  Outpt Blood Cx + for MSSA --> admitted
to OSH for IV ceftriaxone, zosyn and levofloxacin.  Few days
later changed to nafcillin and then PCN.  He continues to have
positive blood cultures despite treatment.  TEE report from
[**2133-6-18**] showed increased echogenicity on 2 pacer wires without
vegetations, EF 35%.
 He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2133-6-23**] for persistent staph aureus
bacteremia after receiving IV abx since readmission on [**2133-6-12**],
concern for PPM infection, and acute renal failure occurring
while receiving abx at OSH.
  In CCU, patient remained hemodynamically stable.  ID, Renal,
and CT surgery consultants are following.  Patient currently on
IV ceftriaxone and oxacillin.

dual-pacer, s/p CAB

Renal U/S [**2133-6-24**]: no hydro, no stones, no masses in kidneys,
prostate enlarged, small echogenic kidneys

Brief Hospital Course:
1) MSSA Bacteremia: Patient received Nafcillin and PCN at OSH
and last + BCx was [**6-19**]. He then developed ARF likely [**3-4**] AIN
(white cell casts seen in urine despite lack of urine
eosonophils). He was then switched to vancomycin and placed on
prednisone. EP was planning on removing pacer wires at a later
time. In the setting of his renal failure, his lasix, ACEI and
allopurinol were held.

*
2) CARDIAC:
.
A) CAD: s/p CABG in [**2120**]. No evidence of ischemia on EKG.
Continued ASA, statin, BB (holding ACE-I [**3-4**] ARF).   Patient had
a h/o CHF: EF 35%. No evidence of failure on admission. Pt takes
lasix 80mg QOD even days, 40mg QOD odd days as OP.  Held and
ace. He was started on low dose BB, titrate up as tolerated
.
C) Atrial fibrillation: History of chronic afib. OP Coumadin
dose 1.25mg M-Sat; 2.5mg QSun.  INR 21 on admission, 12 today.
He was then given some vitamin K
*
3) COPD: No evidence of exacerbation.
--Continued on atrovent, albuterol PRN

Patient was doing much better, until he developed the acute
onset of SOB requiring intubation and transfer to MICU. Given
his h/o of PE, there was concern for repeat PE. Given his renal
failure, CTA was difficult and given his COPD, a V/Q scan was
not feasible as well. He was started on heparin drip. He also
became hypotensive refractory to triple pressor support. An echo
was done which showed a severe EF depression (less than 10%)
with RV dilation and seevre global RV hypokinesis.  EKG has no
ischemic changes and first set of enzymes was negative. Concern
was still for a massive PE and there was a question as to
whether lytics sould be started. However, patient was oozing
blood from his line site and decision was to only start lytics
if a PE was definite. He was too unstable to go for CTA, and
decison was to take the patient to cath to better define his HD.
 He continued to clinically decline and was started on broad
spectrum abx, including vanco, levo, [**Doctor Last Name **] gent.  A pulmonary
angiogram was done, and showed no evidence of PE.  In addition,
his blood cultures grew [**5-4**] gram negative rods, and patient
continued  to decline clinially and seemed in septic shock with
limited cardaic reserve. His family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the case
was discussed. Patient passed away shortly thereafter.
