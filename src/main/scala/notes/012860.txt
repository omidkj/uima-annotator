Chief Complaint:
s/p mechanical fall w/ L-knee hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17926**] is an 81-year old female w/ COPD, CHF, A-fib (s/p
failed DCCV) on Coumadin, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] this
AM after sustaining a mechanical fall off of her commode at
approximately 1 AM. She states she was on the commode at home
(in [**Location (un) 2624**] where she lives w/ her daughter) in the middle of the
night when she reached down to pick something up that had fallen
and reportedly felt dizzy, struck her head on the edge of the
bathtub and then fell onto her knees, injuring her left knee the
most. CT scan at OSH was negative for ICH. She reports having
had knee X-rays done at OSH but no records were sent with her
documents. She developed large L-knee hematoma and was found to
have INR of 11 at OSH. She was given 10mg IV Vitamin K and 1 u
FFP prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
work-up of possible compartment syndrome given large ecchymoses
on L and absence of pulses by report. She denies LOC at time of
the fall and remembers everything that occured at the time. She
notes having dizzy episodes in the past due to decreased PO
intake and imbalances in her "electrolytes".

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS:  95.8;  80;  81/60; 20; 100% on 2L
NC. Patient was given 500cc NS, had basic labs (no imaging).

Orthopedics evaluated pt in ED who thought there was no current
sign of compartment syndrome, and that this was a large hematoma
in the setting of supratherapeutic INR. They recommended
conservative management w/ RICE, WBAT. She was originally
admitted to medicine service but was transferred to ICU For low
blood pressures and further hemodynamic monitoring, although it
was noted her blood pressure normally runs low. Per ED records,
pt's BP did not respond adequately to 500cc NS [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was
transferred to ICU for further care. Pt has ? hx CHF so
additional boluses were not given.

Of note, pt reports starting a new antibiotic 4 days ago (does
not recall the name) for urinary tract infection. States INR was
around 2.2 when last checked on [**First Name3 (LF) 2974**] ([**5-2**]). On ROS, pt denies
CP, SOB, GI Sx. C/o pain in her L-knee and dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17926**] is an 81-year old lady with atrial fibrillation
who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, after sustaining a
mechanical fall resulting in a large L-knee hematoma in the
setting of supratherapeutic INR.

1. HYPOTENSION- Ms. [**Known lastname 17926**] was sent to the ICU because of
blood pressure in the 80s- the pt's baseline is 110s. This was
likely in the setting of hypovolemic shock from profuse blood
loss as pt was bleeding into her L-knee space as evidenced by
large hematoma. Pt's chronic lymphedema contributed to
inadequate drainage of the site. Pt's hypotension improved with
aggressive volume resuscitation with IVF and blood products and
remained stable in 120s by ICU day 2, on day of transfer to
general medical wards. Her home diuretics (for lymphedema) were
initially held in the setting of hypotension, but they were
restarted prior to discharge.  She remained normotensive
throughout the rest of her admission.

2. L- KNEE [**Name (NI) 85512**] Pts L-knee hematoma was large in the
setting of lymphedema and supratherapeutic INR. At [**Hospital1 2519**], there was concern for compartment syndrome due to
poorly palpable pulses and pain. Therefore, pt was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for orthopedic surgery evaluation. Ortho evaluated pt
in the ED and felt conservative management with ACE wrap and
elevation was important, and that compartment syndrome was
unlikely. Pt received a total of 5u PRBCs and 3u FFP during her
1st 24 hours in the ICU as her hematocrit had not increased
appropriately, likely in the setting of active bleeding. Prior
to transfer to the general medical wards, her HCT had been
stable at 28-29 for 24 hours. She continued to be followed by
orthopedics and had an ultrasound of her leg which showed the
presence of a complex collection likely representing a clot with
edema within the suprapatellar bursa of her left leg. The clot
was not drained as the patient stated that her pain was
improved.  She was given percocet and standing tylenol for pain.
 She was evaluated by PT who thought that she would benefit from
inpatient rehabilitation.  However, the patient did not wish to
go to rehab.  She lives with her children and they were taught
how to transfer the patient out of bed.  She was set up with
home PT 3 times a week. She had a follow up appointment
scheduled with her PCP on [**2149-5-16**].

3. SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR- At [**Hospital3 **], pt's INR was
supratherapeutic at 11. She was given 1u FFP and 10mg IV vitamin
K. Her INR was likely elevated in the setting of recent
initiation of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis as this
interacts with the cytochrome P450 system. In the ICU she
required 3 units of FFP to reach therapeutic INR. Coumadin was
held throughout her ICU course and was restarted at 2.5 mg Q day
while inpatient on the medical wards.  She was monitored and her
INR was 1.1 the day of discharge.  She was set up to have her
home VNA check her INR over the weekend.  She was told to
discontinue the fluconazole which had likely precipitated the
elevated INR due to its metabolism interaction with coumadin.
She also was told to stop the Bactrim that she had been taking
prior to admission.  She was started on Ciprofloxacin for a UTI
(see below) and therefore will need close monitoring of her INR
while she is on this medication wihch can also interact.

4. ATRIAL [**Name (NI) **] Pt initially was in atrial fibrillation
with rate in the 110s-120s. Rate was elevated likely in the
setting of hypovolemia from blood loss. Initially metoprolol was
held, but was restarted on [**5-7**] as pt became more
hemodynamically stable, and rate was well-controlled in the 70s.
 She had no
