CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year-old
male with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
porcine aortic valve placed in [**2150**] who presents to [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2170-4-2**] with a day
and a half history of shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion with chest pressure.  He denies any nausea,
vomiting, diaphoresis, cough, fevers or chills at that time.
He denies any changes in diet, no melena, no bright red blood
per rectum.  Chest x-ray on admission showed mild congestive
heart failure.  He was gently diuresed.  He was found to have
a troponin leak of 2.2.  The patient was taken to cardiac
catheterization where his O2 sat dropped to the 70% when he
laid down and he was intubated.  On cardiac catheterization
no hemodynamically significant lesions were found.  The
patient became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in
the 60s and a low cardiac output and low cardiac index.  An
intraaortic balloon pump was placed.  The patient's cardiac
index dropped even further.  An emergent echocardiogram was
done showing 3+ aortic insufficiency to 3+ mitral
regurgitation.  The intraaortic balloon pump was removed.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, pressors were started.
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for
stabilization.  During cardiac catheterization the wedge
pressure was 36, right atrial pressures the mean was 18,
pulmonary artery pressure mean of 27, right ventricular
pressure was 63 and 4 with a mean of 19.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, the patient
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2150**] with
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one and right
coronary artery.  During that time he also had his aortic
valve replaced with a porcine valve in [**2165**].  He had a
myocardial infarction with three stents placed to the right
coronary artery and saphenous vein graft.  He was again
stented in [**2167-9-6**].  In [**2167-11-6**] he was found
to have atrial flutter and a pacemaker was placed.  He was
diagnosed with congestive heart failure in [**2167**].  Recent
echocardiogram in [**2169-11-5**] showed an ejection
fraction of 30% with 1+ aortic regurgitation, 3+ mitral
regurgitation.  Basal inferior and inferior lateral
hypokinesis with septal hypokinesis, apical hypo and
akinesis.  He had chronic anemia with a baseline hematocrit
of 29.  He has a hiatal hernia that was repaired, lower
gastrointestinal bleed, benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic
renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.0 to 1.5.

ALLERGIES:  Niacin.  Sulfa, but tolerates Lasix.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  His health care proxy is his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **]
lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has no tobacco, alcohol or drug
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was afebrile on transfer to the
Cardiac Care Unit, blood pressure 125/47 on Dopamine and
Levophed.  Heart rate 76.  Respiratory rate 11.  He was on
assist control at 100% FIO2, tidal volume of 700, respiratory
rate 12, PEEP of 5 sating 100%.  He was sedated elderly male.
Jugulovenous distention up to the jaw.  He had crackles
anteriorly bilaterally in the lung bases.  His heart was
irregularly irregular with 3 out of 6 diastolic murmur and
systolic murmur.  His abdomen was soft, normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were cold with 1+ pitting edema.  He had
1+ posterior tibial pulses, dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  He was sedated.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 5.7, hematocrit 34.9, 44%
neutrophils, 28% lymphocytes, INR 2.2, platelets 142, PTT
132.4.  Chemistries sodium 138, potassium 4.9, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 26, BUN 55, creatinine 2.1, glucose 129, calcium
8.9, phos 5.9, magnesium 2.3.  CKs during the hospital course
were 197 to 144 to 126 with troponin less then 0.3, 0.8 and
then third set 2.2.  Arterial blood gas 7.40, CO2 33, O2 of
217 on FIO2 of 100% on assist control.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Care Unit.  His pressor regimen was switched to Milrinone for
the inotropic and vaso dilatation effect as well as
Neo-synephrine for the pressor effect.  His map was
maintained above 60 throughout the first night.  Blood
cultures were sent, urine cultures and urinalysis were sent.
Cardiothoracic surgery reevaluated the patient and still felt
that the patient was unstable for the Operating Room.  He
underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram, which showed no
atrial septal defect, mild focal left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis, no aortic dissection
and a flailing of aortic leaflet with 3+ aortic
regurgitation, 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation.  No vegetations
were seen.  The patient was also started on a Lasix drip for
diuresis given his high wedge pressure.  His FIO2 was weaned
down to 60% as tolerated.  A chest x-ray showed a left lower
lobe infiltrate.  He was started on Levofloxacin.  The
patient proceeded to develop splinter hemorrhages and what
seemed like septic emboli to his toes and fingers.  He was
started on Vancomycin to cover him for endocarditis.  Serial
blood cultures were sent.  The patient remained in critical
condition on two pressors.

Infectious Disease Service was consulted who recommended
covering with Vancomycin, continuing to follow up with the
blood cultures.  The grim prognosis was discussed with the
family.  The family expressed that the patient expressed
clearly prior to this episode that he would not want to be on
a machine and he would not want any aggressive measures.  The
family decided to make the patient do not resuscitate, do not
intubate.  The plan was to extubate him on the morning of [**4-5**] with the family present and to withdraw care at that point,
however, on the night of [**4-4**] the patient extubated
himself.  The decision was made to not reintubate the patient
and the patient expired on [**2170-4-5**] during early morning
around 5:30 a.m.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Cardiac arrest secondary to severe aortic regurgitation
secondary to blown aortic valve.
2.  History of hypertension.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis.
