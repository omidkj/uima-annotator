Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lisinopril / Effexor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, no intervention


History of Present Illness:
66-year-old man with CAD s/p LAD PCI, right SFA/peroneal bypass
and angioplasty, asymptomatic right subclavian and carotid
disease,
brittle diabetes on insulin pump, hyperlipidemia, and
hypertension, who was POD#3 s/p Right total knee replacement at
the [**Hospital1 **] who developed chest pain with BP in the 180s, and
EKG changes infero-laterally with ST depressions similar to EKG
changes during stress test before surgery and concern for V1-3
STe, which was unchanged from EKG at [**Hospital1 18**] 1mo ago. Given the
EKG changes (not aware of baseline EKG at [**Hospital1 18**]) and CP, he was
started on heparin gtt, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
emergent catheterization, which revealed no changes from c.cath
1mo ago.
.
On arrival to cath lab, he was hypertensive and required a nitro
gtt to maintain SBPs < 160, he was given full dose ASA and 600mg
of Plavix. Upon completion of cath, was transferred to the
floor, hypoxemic on 10 L facemask and tachypneic. Nitro gtt was
discontinued. At ~ 1600, had an acute episode of SOB,
desaturations to 92 on max NC, thus requiring NRB to maintain
sats > 96%, BP at the time was 144/65. He was given IV lasix for
suspected pulmonary edema and haldol for agitation. UOP from
lasix was 1L in one hour and his RR improved to low 20s, though
he remained confused. CTA chest was peformed which preliminarily
showed no PE and a ? RUL consolidation with mild pulmonary
edema. He was briefly transferred to the MICU for continued SOB,
hypoxemia and nursing care. During his MICU course he was given
80 mg IV lasix and put out nearly 1.8 L of urine. He was also
quite agitated and delerious (which has been ongoing) and
received 20 mg olanzapine which calmed him down. He is
transferred to the CCU for further management.
.
Notably, most recent cath findings as follows: SBPs 160s - 180s.
60% LAD, MR, right dominant system with 70% 1st diag, 60% 2nd
diagnoal, moderate LCX disease and 60% small PDA. Per discussion
with cards fellow, it was felt that EKG changes constituted
demand ischemia in setting of acute drop in hematocrit from 35
to 26 and was consistent with prior stress test. Of note, [**5-22**]
cath showed diffuse CAD, EF > 60%, there was no intervention and
findings were similar to above. Also of note, upon transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**], he was given 1 unit pRBC for anemia.
.

At OSH, Labs were notable for HCT 35->26 post op, WBC 4.7->9.5
admission to [**6-21**] with left shift, CO2 31, Cr. 0.7 and
CK/CKMB/Trop 503/6.1/0.26 (high/high/nl(< 0.4)). BNP was 311.
.
Per review of OSH nursing notes, pt has been confused since at
least [**6-19**], has been receving dilaudid for pain. On [**6-20**] AM was
noted to be somnolent and resonded to narcan.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope

Reason: POD # 2 s/p kmee surgery, chest pain, clean cath Note:
recei
Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 100
HISTORY: 66-year-old male, with two-vessel coronary artery
disease and LVEF
on LV gram 60%. Now two days status post knee surgery. Presents
with
shortness of breath.

Chest pain. Evaluate for pulmonary embolism or acute aortic
pathology.

COMPARISON: Limited comparison from prior chest radiograph on
[**2173-4-30**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the thoracic inlet to
the lung
bases before and after administration of IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted
images were obtained for evaluation.

CTA CHEST: The pulmonary arterial vasculature is normally
opacified to the
subsegmental level without filling defect to suggest acute
pulmonary embolism.
There is an aorta arch with bovine variant, but the aorta is
otherwise normal
in course and caliber without acute pathology. Scattered
vascular
calcifications are noted along the aortic arch. The remaining
great
mediastinal vessels are normal. Moderate coronary calcifications
are noted.
The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusions.

There are bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right and
tiny on the
left. There are mild adjacent bilateral atelectasis. Increased
septal lines
are compatible with mild pulmonary edema. In the upper lobes,
there are hazy
patchy opacities, right greater than left. While this could
represent the
underlying pulmonary edema, early infectious process cannot be
excluded.
There is no pneumothorax. No mediastinal, hil
