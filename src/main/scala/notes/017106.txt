CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Non-Q wave myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
male with a history of diabetes, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, CHF,
chronic renal insufficiency, and CAD, who was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] from the [**Hospital3 15174**] on [**2139-11-16**] after being ruled in for a non-Q wave MI.

The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital3 15174**] on
the evening of [**2139-11-14**] following the acute onset of
chest pain and shortness of breath while at a church dinner.
He was ruled in for an MI with a troponin peak of 1.07.  He
was started on heparin, IV nitroglycerin, and Aggrastat.  His
symptoms resolved.

An echocardiogram performed while there showed an ejection
fraction of 30% with basilar inferior hypokinesis and
anterior severe hypokinesis to akinesis.  The patient was,
therefore, transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for a cardiac
catheterization.  The patient had previously had a cardiac
catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2139-3-13**], during which the
patient received a stenting of the LAD and PTCA of the
diagonal branch.  He was reported to have done well following
the [**Month (only) 958**] procedure, returning to work five days a week and
able to walk several miles without any chest pain or
shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes times 30 years (on insulin for four years).
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Silent MI.
6.  Status post right renal artery stenting.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post left femoral-popliteal bypass in [**2137**].
2.  Status post cholecystectomy in [**2139-5-13**].
3.  Status post rotator cuff repair.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. (on hold).
4.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. (on hold).
5.  Glucophage 850 mg p.o. t.i.d. (on hold).
6.  TriCor 160 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Restoril 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.
9.  Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Humalog 75/25 44 units in the a.m., 39 units at
dinnertime.
11. Aggrastat drip.
12. Nitroglycerin drip.
13. Heparin drip.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a married [**Country 3992**] and Korean
War veteran with possible post-traumatic stress disorder.
The patient works at [**Company 2486**] five mornings a week.  The
patient quit smoking 30 years ago after a 40 pack year
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was a
well-developed, well-nourished male lying on a stretcher in
no apparent distress.  Vital signs:  130/53, 82, 99%.  Neck:
The patient had no JVD and no bruits.  Lungs:  The patient
had bibasilar rales, worse on the left.  Heart:  The patient
had normal S1, S2, with no murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following cardiac catheterization, the
decision was made to consult Cardiothoracic Surgery given
that the patient's disease was not amenable to medical
therapy.  The patient was taken for CABG on [**2139-11-17**]
and the procedure was performed without complications.

The patient was, thereafter, transferred to the CSIU for
continued monitoring.  The patient's stay in the CSIU was
only notable for frequent ectopy noted on his rhythm strip.
The ectopy was noted to persist in spite of correction of the
patient's electrolytes.  The patient noted that he had a
history of frequent ectopy.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Floor on postoperative day number two.  He continued to
recover uneventfully.  The ectopy noted on his rhythm strips
in the CSIU persisted on the floor.  His heart rhythm
remained stable in sinus rhythm.  His pain was well
controlled.

A postoperative EKG obtained for the patient following
arrival from the floor demonstrated isolated ST segment
elevation in leads V1 through V3.  At the time the EKG was
obtained, the patient was complaining of some sharp
needle-like pain on the right side of his chest which was
later deemed noncardiac in origin.  Repeat EKGs at eight and
12 hours as well as at the time of discharge demonstrated no
changes from the first postoperative EKG.  A series of
cardiac enzymes drawn on the patient were all negative.

The patient was deemed stable for discharge to home on
postoperative day number four.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Percocet.
2.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Metformin 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.

10. Humalog 75/25 20 units at bedtime and at breakfast.

following discharge.  The patient was also to follow with his
primary care physician following discharge.
