pneummonia and she required iv antibiotics and prednisone taper
for "asthma exacerbation". A CT scan of the chest was done and
was suggestive of tracheal stenosis and TBM. She was then
referred from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64744**], her pulmonologist at [**Hospital3 **],

night for her sleep apnea as well. She was admitted for tracheal
resection and reconstruction for tracheal stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2165-4-26**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar
lavage and cervical tracheal resection and reconstruction. There
were no complications to the procedure. Please see operative
report for more details. She was directly admitted to the
surgical ICU post-operatively and transferred to the floor POD3.
Her hospital course can be summmarized by the following review
of systems:

Neuro: Patient pain was controlled with a PCA of dilaudid. She
was transitioned to an oral regimen once tolerating diet. By
discharge, her pain was well-controlled on Roxicet. She had no
neurological deficits.

Cardio: She was hemodynamically stable. Her beta-blockade was
resumed immediately post-operatively. Her oral regimen was
maintained and adjusted to lower dosing of atenolol 25mg po
daily. She had sinus bradycardia in the mid 40's occasionally
but was assymptomatic. She had no other issues. Her lisinopril
and norvasc dosed were also halved due to excellent blood
pressure.

Pulm: S/p tracheal resection with reconstruction. She was taken
directly to the surgical ICU post-operatively and extubated
later that evening. She maintained her airway with no
respiratory distress. Her Lasix was resumed on POD6 due to
slight shortness of breath and pedal edema. She did not require
any oxygen on discharge. Bronchoscopy performed POD 7 showed
intact anastomosis and patent airway. Sutures were cut.

GI: Patient was kept NPO for 3 days for aspiration precautions.
She was then advanced to a soft regular diet. PPI was resumed.
No other issues.

FEN/Renal: As she is on daily lasix, her fluid status was
closely monitored. She made adequate urine t/o this hospital
stay. Lasix was resumed on POD6. No other issues.

Heme: She was started on SQH and had no other issues.

ID: Pre-operative antibiotics of ancef. No infectious issues or
concerns.

Endo: Blood sugars were watched closely, and the patient was
placed on lantus 10 units which kept her sugars controlled below
130 mostly. She will followup with outpatient endocrinologist
for further uptitration of her lantus insulin if her glucoses
are >150, as she was discharged well below her home dose of 52
units qhs. She was also resumed on her metformin.

Dispo: The patient was deemed safe by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
discharge home today. VNA was ordered to visit her once.
