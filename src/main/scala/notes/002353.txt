Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Known aneurysm, now enlarged in size

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.Right sided pterional craniotomy for right-sided ICA
bifurcation aneurysm clipping.
2.  Microsurgical dissection.
3.  Duroplasty.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 50-year-old  female that was found to have an
incidentally discovered  right-sided ICA bifurcation aneurysm.
This aneurysm has been known for several years. It is followed
up by sequential scans. The  patient has now undergone a formal
angiogram by Dr.[**Name (NI) 10136**]  service on [**2159-4-5**]. The
catheter angiogram with  gadolinium has confirmed a 9 x 5.5mm
bilobed aneurysm at the bifurcation of the right anterior and
middle cerebral arteries. It appears to have a wide neck
measuring approximately 4.5 to 5mm. Overall, the patient has
done well and remains clinically  intact and stable. She has
done [**Location (un) 1131**] on the issue and decided that she does not want to
undergo coiling which is technically difficult with wide neck
aneurysms anyway. The patient opted to have an open surgery and
wants to have definite occlusion by clipping. She is seen for
surgical counseling in neurosurgery office.

Currently, she denies any new symptoms such as headaches,
nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. The patient has no seizures or
focal neurological deficits. She had persistent balance problems
secondary to spinal and cervical stenosis.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**5-17**]:
IMPRESSION: NG tube in left lower lobe segmental bronchus. This
has been communicated immediately to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of
the review of the study at approximately 10 p.m. on [**2159-5-16**].
.
Angeography:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of perfusion to the clipped right ICA
bifurcation aneurysm. No evidence of residual aneurysm. The
right ICA, MCA, ACA and the major branches are patent.
.
CT [**5-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Again noted is intraparenchymal hemorrhage within
the right temporal lobe with surrounding edema that measures
slightly larger compared to prior study. Increase in
high-density material seen within the right frontal extra-axial
space with slight increase in leftward shift of midline
structures. Discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13013**] at 6:45 a.m. on [**5-18**], [**2159**].
.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The increase in extra axial
fluid is expected as fluid replaces air at the surgical site.
The slight change in the appearance of the post operative
hemorrhage in the temporal lobe does not necessarily reflect
increased bleeding.
.
[**5-19**] CT:
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of right inferior frontotemporal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
Post-surgical changes from right frontal craniotomy. No new
hemorrhage, hydrocephalus or increased shift of normally midline
structures is identified.
.
[**5-22**] CT:
FINDINGS: Examination is essentially unchanged from the previous
study. Again is noted increased density in middle cranial fossa
consistent with hemorrhage within the temporal lobe and/or
subjacent to it. There is some gas still seen in the right
frontal extra-axial compartment. Artifact to the aneurysm
clipping is again noted. There is low density in the head of the
caudate consistent with infarction. There are some malacic
changes in the right frontal lobe.
.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance when compared to previous
examination.
.
[**5-24**] CXR:
The previously identified opacities in both lower lobes have
been markedly improving. The lungs are clear otherwise. The
heart and mediastinum are within normal limits. The right
jugular IV catheter remains in place. No pneumothorax is
identified.
.
[**5-24**] Renal US:
FINDINGS:
The right lower quadrant renal transplant measures 13.8 cm in
length, which is unchanged from the prior study. Cortical
echogenicity is likely within normal limits but may be mildly
increased. Cortical-medullary differentiation persists. There
are no renal masses, hydronephrosis, or calculi. Arterial flow
is identified within the upper, mid and lower pole wrist with
resistive indices up to 0.90 which are increased from the prior
study. Renal vein is patent. No perinephric fluid collections.

IMPRESSION:
Right lower quadrant renal transplant without hydronephrosis.
All vessels patent though resistive indices are slightly
increased from the prior study, which is nonspecific.
.
[**5-25**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. First degree A-V block.
Left
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-5-19**]
no significant diagnostic change.
.
[**5-28**] US:
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left internal
jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and basilic veins were
performed. There is a sm
