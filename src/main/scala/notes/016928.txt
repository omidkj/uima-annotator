HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old gentleman
whose chief complaint is failing aortobifemoral graft. The
patient is well-known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]. The patient had a
previous right iliac stenting in [**2105-4-26**] and a fem-fem
bypass in [**2106-7-27**]. He returns now with a failed graft
for elective aortobifemoral bypass.

DRUG ALLERGIES:  Bupropion, Zoloft and Celexa cause diarrhea.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Albuterol p.r.n., aspirin 325 mg
daily. Fish oil.  Flovent p.r.n., lisinopril 20 mg daily,
Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.  Simvastatin 40 mg daily.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Known peripheral vascular disease with
claudication. History of hypertension. History of ischemic
heart disease with a myocardial infarction in [**2096**]. Stress
done on [**2106-6-1**] was without anginal symptoms. He had a
severe fixed inferior wall defect with associated
hypokinesis.  The patient also has had an atrial myxoma
resection in [**2104-1-27**]. His echo in [**1-/2106**] showed no
mass or thrombus seen in the left atrium or the atrial
appendage. Ejection fraction was greater than 55%. The aortic
valve was normal. The mitral valve was 1+ MR.  There was a
hyperdense mass on the left ventricular side of the posterior
leaflet but not attached to the leaflet. The patient has
history of chronic obstructive disease with asthma, history
of cerebrovascular accident in [**2074**] with a left frontal CVA
and left parietal CVA in [**2092**] and a left middle cerebral
artery stroke in [**2102**] without residual. The patient does have
a history of migraines remote. The patient has a history of
hypercholesteremia, peripheral neuropathy, chronic renal
insufficiency, history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], history of
ventral hernia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Previous surgeries include a right
iliac stenting in [**2105-4-26**],  a left atrial myxoma resection
in [**1-/2104**],  a right olecranon process abscess I&D in [**2106-5-27**] and a fem-fem bypass in 08/[**2105**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a current smoker within the
last month. He smokes one pack per day for the last 20 years.
Denies alcohol or recreational drug use. Does have a history
of depression.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Patient is in no acute distress. He is alert
and oriented. Heart is a regular rate and rhythm with no
murmur, gallops or rubs. There are no carotid bruits. Lungs
are clear to auscultation. The abdomen was obese, soft,
nontender with a large ventral hernia. Extremities were
without edema. Pulse exam:  The left DP and PT were palpable
1+. The right DP and PT were palpable 2+. The toes were pink,
warm with brisk capillary refill.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted over to Balding
area on [**2107-5-3**]. He underwent an aortobifemoral bypass
graft with knitted micro Dacron Velour, an excision of fem-
fem graft. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition. An epidural was
placed intraoperatively. This was utilized for pain
management.  Later that same day in the PACU, the patient
developed a cold foot and the patient returned to surgery and
underwent a thrombectomy of the graft limb on the left. The
patient remained intubated and was transferred to the ICU for
continued monitoring and care.  Postoperative day 2,
overnight events: The patient had an episode of atrial
flutter which was converted to normal sinus rhythm with
amiodarone drip. There were no other acute events. The
patient remained intubated. The patient's PA numbers showed
vascular spacing. Fluid was held. Lasix was begun. Extubation
and weaning from vent with extubation was begun.
Postoperative day 3, the patient continued with an epidural.
He was extubated. His diet was advanced and ambulation was
begun. The patient was transferred to the VICU for continued
monitoring and care. His epidural was discontinued. He was
begun on oral pain medications for analgesic control.
Postoperatively on postop day 2, the patient's creatinine was
elevated at 1.9. It peaked at 2.9. Renal was consulted on
postoperative day #3. They felt that the ATN was related to
the perioperative hypertension, causing pre renal azotemia
versus ischemic ATN. Lasix was discontinued. The blood
pressure was allowed to normalize at 120. Blood pressure
medicines were held. Urine lytes were sent. All medicines
were renal dosed.  By postoperative day number 4, the patient
began to show mild improvement in his creatinine. It went
from 2.9 to 2.7.  Diuretics were still held. It was felt
there was no need or indication for dialysis. The patient was
ambulated. His Lopressor was increased. His diet was advanced
to a regular diet by postoperative day 4. By postoperative
day #5, the patient began to pass flatus. His creatinine
continued to show improvement. It was 2.2. Because of weights
up 10 kg, he was given Lasix. The patient did have a small
bowel movement on postoperative day #5. The patient did have
some mild abdominal distention. His diet was placed on hold
and he was allowed sips only. He was given aggressive bowel
regimen with improvement in his abdominal distention and
bowel sounds improved so that he had sounds in all 4
quadrants. His creatinine continued to show improvement by
postoperative day 6.  He was begun on sips to clears and on
postoperative day #7, his diet was advanced as tolerated
which he tolerated. Physical therapy saw the patient and felt
he would be able to be discharged to home. He was discharged
home on postoperative day #8 in stable condition with
improving renal function. His creatinine at discharge was
2.2. Diuretics were still held. The patient was instructed to
follow up with his cardiologist regarding management of his
diuresis and to monitor his renal function. His amiodarone
dosing for his atrial flutter was 400 mg b.i.d. for a total
of 3 more days and then starting on [**5-13**], he would be on
Amiodarone 200 mg daily. Thyroid function studies were
ordered. We also ordered C3-C4 amylase and lipase for renal
recommendations.  Renal wanted to rule out embolic source for
his renal failure.

At the time of discharge, hematocrit was 30.1, BUN 37,
creatinine 2.2, K 4.1.  The patient was discharged to home.
Social service saw the patient prior to discharge for
arrangements regarding home services.  We want VNA to come in
to see the patient on discharge to monitor the groin wounds
and pulse rate and blood pressure and weight. The patient has
been instructed to follow up with his cardiologist within a
weeks time. He should take all medications as directed. He
should continue on a stool softener regime since he is on
narcotics.  He may ambulate essential distances with
progression but no driving until seen in follow-up. The groin
clips should remain in place and the wounds should be
monitored for any erythema, swelling or drainage. If he
develops a fever greater than 101.5 or changes in his wounds,
he should notify Dr.[**Name (NI) 1392**] office. He should notify his
cardiologist if he develops any weight gain greater than 2
pounds over 24 hours. The patient also should follow up with
his cardiologist regarding his amiodarone dosing monitoring
and thyroid function study monitoring
