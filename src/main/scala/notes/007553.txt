History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo gentleman with hx CABG, MI x2, of stage
IV heart failure, multiple admissions for CHF exacerbation who
was transferred for further management of his heart failure. Pt
states that most recently he has been in rehab and has been
doing well with increased exercise tolerance, until
approximately a week ago when he felt weak all over and slowly
fell to the ground, no LOC. Since that time, pt states that he
has been feeling progressively weak. While he denies worsening
SOB, nursing noted labored breathing and low BPs to the 80s
systolic for the last two days. Pt also denies CP, palpitations
or worsening LE edema. He requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management of his heart failure.

His most recent hospitalization was in [**12-8**] for SOB. At that
time, pressures were in the 80s/90s and pt was satting 89-95% on
RA. He was treated with diuresis and ciprofloxacin for a UTI. At
that time, pt was offered hospice but refused. He was
transferred to rehab facility on discharge

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, recent syncope or presyncope. Pt does state that
he had one episode of syncope over [**Holiday **], but none since.
Also states that he has trouble lying flat but cannot articulate
why.

.
[**1-6**] EKG: Ventricular paced rhythm with ventricular couplets.
Atrial mechanism is uncertain. Since the previous tracing of
[**2172-9-23**] atrial activity/question pacing is more difficult to
assess.
.
[**1-6**] CXR: Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Left transvenous
pacemaker leads terminating in standard position in the right
atrium, right ventricle and through the coronary sinus. There is
haziness of the perihilar regions minimally increased from prior
study consistent with chronic CHF. There is no strong evidence
of pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. There is no large
pleural effusion. Sternal wires are aligned.
.
[**2173-1-7**] TTE: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild (non-obstructive)
focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The estimated cardiac index
is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
IMPRESSION: Severely dilated and hypokinetic right and left
ventricles with moderate to severe mitral and tricupsid
regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The inferior and inferior septum are severely hypokinetic
akinetic with the other segments being moderately hypokinetic.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-7-9**],
the function of the lateral wall is probably worse on the
current study. The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation
have increased. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressures are slightly lower but are probably UNDERestimated
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.
