Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2199-10-25**]
Mitral valve repair with 30mm ring
left atrial resection, left sided Maze


History of Present Illness:
This 58 year old male who has a history of mitral regurgitation.
He has been followed by serial echocardiograms for the past 5
years. His most recent
echocardiogram done on [**2199-9-3**] showed severe mitral
regurgitation with severe prolapse/flail of the posterior mitral
valve leaflet and severe pulmonary hypertension. He denies any
chest pain or shortness of breath at rest currently. He does
note having some shortness of breath with exertion such as
climbing a flight of stairs quickly. He did have a 36 hr episode
of Aflutter/Fib ~ 3 weeks ago and was started on Coumadin by Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  Currently he is in SR and last dose of Coumadin was Sun
[**10-20**].  He is admitted for
Heparin bridge, Coumadin washout with plans for mitral  repair
vs.
replacment, left atrial ligation and MAZE on [**10-25**].


Past Medical History:

persistent cough/hoarseness
Uvulopalatoplasty with CO2 laser [**7-5**]
Septoplasty and partial inferior turbinectomy [**4-4**]

Pertinent Results:
[**2199-10-25**] Intra-op TEE:
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed,
EF 40-50%.
There is moderate hypokinesis of the RV.
There is a focal calcification in the aortic arch. There are no
atheroma visualized in the arch or the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
prolapse of the posterior mitral leaflet, predominantly
involving the P2 and P3 scallops. The P2 portion is flail with
ruptured chordae seen. There is severe eccentric MR [**First Name (Titles) 39788**] [**Last Name (Titles) 111537**]y. There is systolic flow reversal in the pulmonary
veins, consistent with elevated LA pressure.
POST-CPB:
The anterior mitral leaflet has normal mobility and spans almost
the entire mitral valve, while the posterior leaflet is small,
consistent with mitral valve repair. A mitral valve annuloplasty
ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears well seated
with peak transmitral gradient of 8mmHg and mean gradient of
3mmHg. There is trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] patterns are normal
by spectral Doppler.
The RV systolic function appears mildly improved from pre-op.
The LV continues to be dilated with now moderate global
hypokinesis, EF 25-35%. There is paradoxical septal wall motion,
consistent with pacing.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2199-10-25**] where
he underwent Mitral Valve repair with a 30mm ring, left atrial
appendage ligation and Maze procedure.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was used for surgical
antibiotic prophylaxis given his preoperative length of stay of
greater than 24 hours.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward his preoperative weight.

The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  Coumadin was resumed for his history of
atrial fibrillation and the left atrial appendage ligation.  The
patient will remain on Coumadin for three months post-op and if
he is in sinus rhythm at three months, Coumadin may be
discontinued.  The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged to home in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.

His anticoagulation will continue to be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
