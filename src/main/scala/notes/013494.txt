Date of Birth:   [**2044-4-20**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower extremity edema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year-old
woman with a history of congestive heart failure of
restrictive type and aortic stenosis who was initially
admitted to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital on [**2111-2-4**] with complaints of
worsening lower extremity edema and dyspnea on exertion.  She
denied any chest pain, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  At [**Hospital 487**] Hospital she was diuresed.  An
echocardiogram at that time indicated an EF of 40 to 45% with
mild left ventricular hypertrophy, severe apical hypokinesis,
moderate septal and distal hypokinesis and severe atrial
fibrillation.  Her creatinine during that admission was noted
to be elevated at approximately 2.1 with a baseline of
approximately 1.6 by report.  Chest CT at the outside
hospital showed an incidental finding of mediastinal
lymphadenopathy and pulmonary artery prominence.  She was
subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
for further management and possible cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2105**] with left internal
mammary coronary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery and saphenous vein graft to the ramus, obtuse
marginal and posterior descending coronary artery.  2.
History of congestive heart failure restrictive type.  3.
Aortic stenosis.  4.  Hypertension.  5.
Hypercholesterolemia.  6.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  7.
Hypothyroidism.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  1.  Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d.  2.
Protonix 40 mg po q.d.  3.  Neurontin.  4.  Glucophage 1000
mg po b.i.d.  5.  Zestril 10 mg po q.d.  6.  Lopresor 12.5 mg

Zalatan 0.005% eye drops.  11.  Cosopt eye drops.  12.  Multi

ALLERGIES:  The patient reports allergies to Naprosyn, sulfa,
Biaxin and Clindamycin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient reports smoking approximately
two to three cigarettes per day.  She has previously smoked
one to two packs per day for approximately forty years.  She
denies ethanol or intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile, temperature
97.8.  Heart rate 58.  Blood pressure 135/98 with an oxygen
saturation of 81% on room air and 95% on 3 liters nasal
cannula.  She was an elderly appearing woman in no acute
distress.  Her HEENT examination was unremarkable with pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Sclera
anicteric.  Her neck was supple.  Carotids 2+ without bruits.
JVD of approximately 8 cm.  No palpable thyromegaly or
lymphadenopathy.  She had bilateral crackles two thirds of
the way up.  Her heart was regular rate and rhythm
occasionally bradycardic with 3 out of 6 systolic murmur from
the right upper sternal border radiating to the neck.  Her
lower extremities had 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Her
right groin had no bruit.  Her neurological examination
cranial nerves III through XII were grossly intact.  The
patient was alert and oriented times three.

PERTINENT LABORATORY STUDIES:  White blood cells 7.2,
hematocrit 26.0, platelets 152, sodium 141, potassium 3.9,
chloride 101, bicarb 30, BUN 36, creatinine 1.6, CK were flat
at 71 and 63.  Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital
showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 49, normal axis, mild
PR prolongation consistent with first degree block and T wave
flattening in the lateral leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit Service after cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization showed a proximal 100% left anterior
descending coronary artery lesion, left circumflex was 70%
proximal 100% mid occlusions, right coronary artery with 100%
proximal and patent saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal
grafts, 70% left internal mammary coronary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
ramus and posterior descending coronary artery totally
occluded.  An left ventriculogram showed an EF of
approximately 40%.  Her right sided filling pressures were
markedly elevated with a right atrial pressure of 97/20,
right ventricular 98/10, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
of 32 and 45 mm peak to peak pressure.  Her aortic valve area
was measured as .55 cm square.  She was subsequently given
120 cc of intravenous Lasix in the catheterization laboratory
and received a total of 276 cc of contrast during this
cardiac catheterization.  Given these catheterization results
it was decided that the patient may benefit from an aortic
valve replacement with an accompanying coronary artery bypass
graft.

As such Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**] of CT Surgery was consulted.  Within 24
hours of cardiac catheterization the patient's creatinine
began to rise and urine output fall.  Her creatinine peaked
on [**2111-2-10**] at 4.6 and she was evaluated by the renal team.
It was believed that her acute renal failure was secondary to
contrast nephropathy on top of a chronic renal insufficiency
caused by her diabetes and hypertension.  By the time of
discharge her renal failure was resolving with her creatinine
falling to 3.3 and continuing to trend down.  As part of her
surgical evaluation a copy of her CT scan from the outside
hospital was obtained, which showed 1 to 2 cm hilar and
peritracheal adenopathy.  This scan was reviewed with the
Pulmonary Service who performed lymph node biopsy and
bronchoscopy.  This biopsy did not reveal any malignant cells
and instead showed a hypocellular specimen with a few group
of bronchial cells, pulmonary macrophages, lymphocytes, red
blood cells and neutrophils.  The pulmonary team recommended
that she have a repeat CT scan in approximately eight weeks
time to examine for any changes in her lymphadenopathy.  The
patient also has a known anemia, which may be secondary to
her chronic renal insufficiency and required transfusion of 2
units of packed red blood cells during this hospitalization.
After transfusion her hematocrit was stable and was
approximately 28 at the time of discharge.

Given the problems listed above full surgical evaluation was
deferred until her renal function returns to baseline and her
pulmonary process is completely worked up as described.  The
patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41825**] on Tuesday
[**2111-2-17**].  At that time it is expected that after checking a
repeat chem 7 and her renal function that a number of her
medications that were held secondary to her renal failure
will be able to be reinstituted.  These medications include
her ace inhibitor, Digoxin and diuretic.  The patient will
also follow up with her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] within the next few weeks.  After her repeat CT scan she
will again be evaluated at her cardiologist's discretion for
possible AVR and coronary artery bypass graft.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  NPH insulin 20 units subQ q.h.s.
2.  Synthroid 100 micrograms po q day.  3.  Lopressor 12.5 mg
po b.i.d.  4.  Tums 500 mg po t.i.d. with meals.  5. Lipitor
10 mg po q.h.s.  6.  Neurontin 300 mg po b.i.d.  7.  Protonix
40 mg po q.d.  Her other medications, which were effected by
her renal function will be reinstituted as previously
described when her renal function returns to baseline.
