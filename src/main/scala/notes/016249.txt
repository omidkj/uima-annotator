HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 18 year old
male involved in a high speed motor vehicle crash/rollover
approximately 100 miles per hour who was unrestrained who had
a prolonged extrication with significant intrusion into the
car.  There was positive loss of consciousness.  The patient
was intubated in the field and initially brought to [**Hospital6 23267**].  Computerized tomography scan at an outside
hospital showed subdural hematoma and a pneumothorax.  He was
brought to [**Hospital6 256**] via
[**Location (un) **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature is 38.2,
pulse 109, blood pressure 120/50, 100% intubated and
paralyzed.  The patient had multiple scalp lacerations that
were stable.  A right frontotemporal area laceration with 2
cm laceration superior to the nose bridge.  Pupils were 2.5
to 2 mm bilaterally.  The face was stable.  The neck was in a
cervical collar.  Trachea was midline.  There was no
crepitus.  Chest was stable.  The lung sounds were coarse
bilaterally.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended.  There was no ecchymosis.  The
pelvis was stable.  Rectal had decreased stone, was guaiac
positive.  Back had no stepoffs, no deformities.  Extremities
had no deformities and were warm with distal pulses, 2+
femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
bilaterally.  Neurologically he was intubated and paralyzed.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory examination included a white
count of 38, hematocrit of 43, PT 13.9, PTT 29.3, INR 1.3,
platelets 228.  Urinalysis had 3 to 5 red blood cells, 0 to 2
white blood cells, sodium is 133, potassium 3.9, chloride 99,
bicarbonate 22, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 124, amylase
44, toxicology screen negative.  Serum-wise and urine screen
showed positive benzodiazepines.  Gas upon entry was 7.37,
41, 158, 25, -1.

Radiologic studies - Chest x-ray showed right pneumothorax,
pelvic AP showed no fractures, dislocations.  Head
computerized tomography scan showed right lateral ventricle
interventricular hemorrhage, intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
multiple foci bilaterally.  Cervical spine computerized
tomography scan showed a C1 ring fracture.  Chest
computerized tomography scan showed a right pneumothorax and
left lower lobe contusion.  Abdomen and pelvis computerized
tomography scan were negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was evaluated in the Trauma
Bay, was stabilized and was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  There he was evaluated by Neurosurgery
and a communible was placed for intracranial pressure
monitoring.  The patient was maintained on sedation and
remained intubated.  The patient remained hemodynamically
stable through his initial course.  Blood pressure control
was maintained to continue cerebral perfusion and avoid
hypotension.  The patient had a repeat head computerized
tomography scan which on hospital day #2 showed no increase
in the intraparenchymal or intraventricular hemorrhages.  The
patient was maintained in the cervical collar for the C1 ring
fracture.  The patient had additional imaging on hospital day
#2 for TLS spine computerized tomography scans which showed
no fractures or dislocations.  The patient's subsequent
laboratory results demonstrated a coagulopathy with INR of 2.
The patient was corrected with 4 units of FFP.  On hospital
day #3 the patient had an electroencephalogram done which
showed moderate to severe encephalopathy secondary to toxic
metabolic or noncircular injuries, but no seizure activity.
The patient's sedation was slowly weaned and the patient
demonstrated movement of all four extremities.  Movement was
not purposeful and the patient did not respond to any
commands.  On hospital day #4 the communible was discontinued
after the patient's intracranial pressures remained stable.
The patient also had a temperature spike.  Sputum was sent
which showed a gram stain of gram negative rods.  The patient
was started on Levaquin.  Cultures remained negative.  The
patient had also been started on advancing tube feeds as
well.  On hospital day #6 the patient's chest tube was
discontinued.  The patient continued to remain on ventilatory
support producing thick amounts of sputum.  The patient's
support was weaned as tolerated.  The decision was made
secondary to the continued depression of his mental status,
the patient received pertracheostomy and percutaneous
gastrostomy tube.  This was done on hospital day #7 without
incident.  The patient was able to wean off of the ventilator
support to trach collar.  The patient on hospital day #8
spike to 39.8.  Blood cultures and sputum revealed
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was
started on Vancomycin for a 10 day course.  Once the
antibiotics were started the patient defervesced and further
cultures have remained negative.  On hospital day #14 the
patient remaining stable with decreased amounts of secretions
was transferred to the floor.  The patient had continued tube
feeds at goal, started on Heparin t.i.d. for neurosurgery for
deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.  The patient has received
multiple lower extremity ultrasound studies for deep vein
thrombosis which have all been negative.  The patient's most
recent x-ray on [**2100-10-5**] showed no evidence of any
pneumonia but continued to have some atelectasis in the right
base.  The patient had a repeat magnetic resonance imaging
scan on the floor which revealed a 5 by 9 mm intraparenchymal
hemorrhage of the left upper lobe, and resolution of other
bleeding.

The patient's mental status has remained stable.  The patient
does not follow commands and will open eyes and withdraw to
painful stimuli. The patient does show purposeful movement in
attempting to remove percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube.  The patient has not demonstrated any evidence of
comprehension or speech when spoken to.  The patient's
strength remains [**4-18**] bilaterally throughout.  The patient has
completed a course of Vancomycin for Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.  The patient is stable and
ready for discharge to rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post motor vehicle accident with the following
injuries.
2.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
3.  C1 cervical spine fracture
4.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous q. 12
2.  Colace 100 mg per gastrostomy tube b.i.d.
3.  Artificial tears 1 to 2 drops both eyes, prn
4.  Dulcolax 10 mg p.r. prn q.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with Neurosurgery in
one week for discharge, should call for an appointment.  The
patient should follow up with the Trauma Clinic in two weeks.

ADDENDUM:  The patient upon entering the outside hospital was
witnessed to have a tonoclonic seizure lasting eight minutes.
The patient was treated with Valium and was placed on
Dilantin in the hospital.  The patient remained on Dilantin
and will do so until follow up with Neurosurgery in the dose
listed on the previous dictation summary.
