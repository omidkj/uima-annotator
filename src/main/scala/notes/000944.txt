Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
hypertensive emergency with AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 96278**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of poorly
controlled hypertension (reported baseline SBP of 170),
dementia; admit with HTN emergency and mental status changes.
Patient had emesis x3, blood-tinged with last episode, at [**Hospital1 1501**]
this morning. She was hypertensive to SBP 190-240/70-90 there
without significant improvement after her morning meds.

In the ED, SBP 270/80, HR 76, afebrile. Had emesis x1; NGL done
with some guaiac positive return (coffee ground appearing). NGT
kept in place, 200 cc total returned to suction. GI consulted,
felt likely [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear; would EGD only if continued
hematemesis and BP more stable. BP wise, brought down to goal
~190 with labetalol gtt. EKG with isolated TWI in V6, 1st set
enzymes negative. There was concern for mental status changes
(at baseline "pleasantly confused", per last d/c summary vaguely
oriented to time/place); in ED patient oriented to self and
agitated requiring restraints to keep patient from pulling out
NGT. Had head CT with no brain pathology but concern for
intraocular hemorrhage on initial read.  Other workup included
lactate 2.2, CXR and U/A unremarkable.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2152-6-29**] 11:56 AM
HISTORY: Altered mental status, systolic blood pressure 200's,
nausea and
vomiting. Rule out intracranial bleed.
COMPARISON: None.
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no evidence of masses,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, infarction,
or hemorrhage. Bilateral basal ganglia calcifications are seen.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with
age-related atrophy. Vascular calcifications are seen. Confluent
hypodensities within the periventricular white matter likely
represent chronic microvascular ischemia. The osseous structures
demonstrate hyperostosis frontalis interna. The surrounding soft
tissues are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses are
clear. Partial opacification of the mastoid air cells
bilaterally is noted. A right scleral band is seen around the
right globe.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2152-6-29**] 2:53 PM
INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with vomiting and abdominal pain.

COMPARISON: Abdominal radiographs from same day.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis
was performed following administration of oral and intravenous
contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained and
reviewed.
CT ABDOMEN: There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis. Liver
is
unremarkable. There is a thin crescent of hyperdensity layering
in the
gallbladder fundus, which may represent a tiny amount of [**Doctor Last Name 5691**]
versus a small focus of adenomyomatosis. Gallbladder is
otherwise unremarkable. Pancreas is atrophic and fatty replaced.
Spleen is unremarkable. Adrenal glands and kidneys are
unremarkable. There is no hydronephrosis. Stomach and
intra-abdominal loops of bowel are unremarkable. Nasogastric
tube is in place, tip in the gastric body. There is a moderate
axial hiatal hernia and a small fat-containing ventral hernia.
There is no free air, free fluid, or abnormal intra- abdominal
lymphadenopathy. There is mild atherosclerotic calcified and
noncalcified plaque throughout the abdominal vasculature.

CT PELVIS: Pelvic loops of large and small bowel are
unremarkable, except to note sigmoid diverticulosis. Evaluation
of the deep pelvic structures is limited by streak artifact from
bilateral hip replacements. There is no definite free pelvic
fluid. There is no abnormal pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no osseous lesion suspicious for
malignancy.
Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine are
noted, with
moderate dextroconvex thoracolumbar scoliosis.
IMPRESSION:
1. No specific CT finding to explain hematemesis and abdominal
pain.
2. Moderate axial hiatal hernia.
3. Diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Small fat-containing ventral hernia.

ECHO [**2152-6-30**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). A mild apical intracavitary gradient is identified.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventr
