CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Upper gastrointestinal bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 74 year old woman with a
past medical history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft, cryptogenic cirrhosis, status post
bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement and mechanical mitral
valve replacement and with diabetes mellitus type 2, who presents
status post upper gastrointestinal bleed at outside hospital.

The patient was in her usual state of health until the day prior
to admission when she had one episode of hematemesis. She was on
Coumadin for mitral valve replacement and had had nosebleeds in
the past but never hematemesis.  She was taken from the
rehabilitation to an outside hospital where an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed which revealed
esophageal and gastric varices.  Six bands were placed in the
esophageal varices.  The patient's lowest hematocrit was 33.0
from a baseline of 30.0.  She was treated with three units of
fresh frozen plasma and three units of packed red blood cells
with her hematocrit reaching 30.1.  She was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.

At the outside hospital, she also got one dose of Ampicillin and
Gentamicin, 10 mg of Vitamin K and was started on Octreotide.

On presentation to [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient was feeling tired, however, she denied any fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.  She also
denied any chest pain or shortness of breath and no urinary
symptoms.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On presentation, blood pressure
130/60; pulse 102, afebrile; respiratory rate 16.  General
appearance:  Very pleasant woman lying in bed, who appears
comfortable.  Skin with slightly yellow skin.  HEENT:
Anicteric sclerae.  Oropharynx clear.  Heart:  Irregularly
irregular; S1, S2.  There is a II/VI systolic murmur.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen soft,
distended, nontender, with active bowel sounds, no obvious
fluid wave.  Extremities with trace edema bilaterally.
Neurological:  Alert and oriented times three.  Mentating
well.  Moderate asterixis.

LABORATORY:  EKG with atrial fibrillation at 95.  Q waves in
leads III, F, V2, V3, V4 and V5.  Intraventricular conduction
delay, LAFB.

Status post cardiac catheterization in [**6-/2144**], with ejection
fraction of 50%, diastolic dysfunction.  No mitral
regurgitation or pulmonary hypertension consistent with left
ventricular failure.

On [**6-/2144**], left atrium moderately dilated. Ejection fraction
of 40 to 45%.

Liver biopsy in [**12/2142**], cirrhosis, focal and mild
sciaticas, rare single necrotic hepatocyte, sinusoidal
chronic inflammation, no granulomas or evidence of bile duct
damage.  Negative iron stain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient presented status
post upper gastrointestinal bleed; also status post
esophagogastroduodenoscopy with banding of six esophageal
varices.  She was started on Octreotide infusion which was
continued for five days; on intravenous Protonix for two days
which was then switched to p.o. Protonix.  Her hematocrit was
monitored every day during her hospital stay and remained
constant even while the patient was being anti-coagulated.

2.  CRYPTOGENIC CIRRHOSIS:  The cryptogenic cirrhosis had been
worked up in [**2142**] and although the etiology remained unclear,
[**Name2 (NI) **] is the most likely explanation and the liver biopsy would
support that.  During this hospitalization, she underwent a TIPS
in order to lower her blood pressure and prevent future upper
gastrointestinal bleed, especially in view of the fact that she
would need anti-coagulation for her atrial fibrillation and
especially her mitral valve replacement which is metallic.

Her liver function tests remained mildly elevated status post
TIPS procedure.  She was also started on Nadolol 20 mg p.o. q.
day which was then advanced to 40 mg p.o. q. day in an attempt to
keep her blood pressure lower.

In regards to her mental status, she was initially confused and
had moderate asterixis.  She was therefore started on Lactulose
which resolved her mild confusion and almost completely resolved
her asterixis as well.  At baseline, her mental status is now
alert and oriented times three and mentating well.

3.  ANTI-COAGULATION:  The patient needed anti-coagulation for
mitral valve replacement.  She was started on heparin one day
post TIPS procedure.  Because of the high risk of rebleeding in
her upper gastrointestinal tract after her banding procedure, she
was not restarted on Coumadin until 48 hours post being anti-
coagulated only with heparin.  Coumadin was then restarted at
twice her home dose, which is usually 1 mg p.o. q. day.  It
eventually took three days for her INRs to become therapeutic at
2.5.

When her INR became therapeutic at 2.5, heparin was discontinued
and she was also discharged from the hospital. Aspirin was held
because of the risk of recurrence of upper gastrointestinal
bleed.

4.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient has a history of
diastolic dysfunction.  She developed some mild crackles and
lower extremity edema.  She was therefore restarted on her home
dose of Lasix 60 mg p.o. q. day.  She also received a few doses
of Lasix intravenously.  She diuresed quite well with 20 mg
intravenously, however, the lower extremity edema never quite
resolved.  She was restarted on her Lisinopril 2 and then 5 mg
p.o. q. day and Lasix was increased to 80 mg p.o. q. day.
However, her lower extremity edema never quite resolved.  Her
oxygen saturation, however, remained around 94 to 96% on room
air.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2.
She usually takes Actos, Glipizide and Lantus.  All of these
medications had been stopped on her admission to the hospital
since she was kept n.p.o. and she was started on an Regular
insulin sliding scale.  As her diet was advanced, all her anti-
hyperglycemic medications were restarted progressively, one after
the other.

6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM:  The patient also has a history of
hyperthyroidism and while an inpatient she was kept on her
outpatient dose of Levothyroxine.

1.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis.
2.  Hepatic encephalopathy.
