Discharge labs:

Imaging:
CT A/P on admission: Limited evaluation due to the lack of
contrast. Diffuse stranding in the retroperitoneum and along the
lateral ascending colon is of uncertain etiology. A repeat CT
after hydration and repeat creatinine is recommended with IV
contrast (paque for the high creatinine) and oral contrast to
further help to determine the cause.

CT Head: No acute intracranial process.

CXR on admission: The lung volumes are slightly low, but no
focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal
limits. Small
extrapulmonary calcific density adjacent to the right lateral
third rib
overlying the scapula is seen, question an osteochondroma
arising from the
scapula versus the rib, unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 77 yo woman with hypertension and diabetes who
presented with TTP on [**2141-4-24**].

1. TTP, complicated by renal failure, hemolytic anemia, and
acute encephalopathy:
She was intially admitted to the ICU and a pheresis line was
placed.  She was started on daily plasma exchange on [**4-25**] and
high-dose steroids.  Rheumatology, Hematology, and the Pheresis
team followed closely.  Her mental status improved, and her
platelet count began to recover with this treatment, but
plateaued.  She was started on weekly rituximab due to slow
improvement.  With rituximab, her platelets improved and her
last dose of plasma exchange was on [**5-19**]. She requires 1
additional dose of rituxan on [**2141-5-29**] and then she will
follow-up with hematology as an outpatient. She will be
discharged on a slow steroid taper with bactrim and PPI
prophylaxis as well as new insulin because of elevated blood
sugars while on prednisone. At the time of discharge, her renal
dysfunction had improved from a Cr peak of 3.4 back to 1.7 where
it appears to have plateaued. Her anemia is stable with Hct of
29 without signs of ongoing hemolysis. During her
hospitalization she did require multiple blood transfusions. Her
platelets rebounded to >200.
.
Rheumatology was consulted as there was concern about a possible
history of lupus, and it was unclear if this may have been
contributing to her resistance to treatment. Further
clarification with her outpatient providers revealed that she
does NOT have a history of lupus, but instead had a history of
relapsing polychondritis and possible pulmonary vasculitis.
Several rheum markers were positive, including SSa and RNP, but
she had no other evidence of systemic rheumatologic illness.
She was evaluated by Rheumatology consult service and would like
to transition her care to [**Hospital1 18**]. She will follow-up as an
outpatient with her [**Last Name (un) **] opthalmologist and then Rheumatology
for further management including timing of re-initiation of
plaquenil.
.
The patient's hypertension was poorly controlled off of
lisinopril and atenolol (due to renal failure). She was changed
to metoprolol with hydralazine and imdur in addition to her home
amlodipine. Her bp medications require further titration as an
outpatient.
.
Diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled without known complications.
Blood sugars were elevated in the setting of high dose steroids,
and holding of Januvia.  Insulin was started and will continue
while the patient receives steroids.
