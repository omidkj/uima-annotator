Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for further evaluation of pancreas


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
70yo female, HTN, DM, admitted 3 weeks ago with pulmonary
symptoms incl. effusions, CT scan of her lungs also revealed
inflammation of pancreas in the upper abdomen (mild stranding),
with normal amylase/lipase; no stones, no biliary dilation.  Did
well; went home and then returned with upper abdominal pain and
shortness of breath req intubation (acute hypoxia) for 24 hours.
 Extubated and did well so transferred to floor.  Repeat CT scan
now showing diffusely enlarged pancreas with pressure on
duodenum and antrum of stomach with ileus; no elevation
amylase/lipase, normal biliary ducts.  CA [**58**]-9 normal.  Kept
NPO, started on TPN.  No nauseau, vomitting.  Not tender.
Returned to unit for repeat hypoxia last weekend, believed from
infiltrates and effusion, required bipap.  Now back to nasal
cannula--placed on antibiotics and improved.  Repeat CT scan 2
days ago, worsening peripancreatic inflammation and beginning
pseudocyst or cyst/malig.  Able to advance diet to clears and
tolerating.

CXR [**2147-3-24**]: Cardiomediastinal contour is unremarkable. Aside
from a discoid atelectasis in the left lower lobe, the lungs are
grossly clear. Increased density in the left CP angle laterally
is most likely consistent with pleural thickening. There is no
pneumothorax. Left subclavian vein catheter terminates in the
mid SVC.

CTA [**2147-3-31**]:
1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
No evidence of extrinsic airway compression. CT trachea study
may be ordered for better assement of airway pathology.
2. Questionable small amount of fluid within the distal trachea
and right mainstem bronchus likely place patient at risk for
aspiration. A more focal area of consolidation is noted along
the right minor fissure which appears slightly retracted
superiorly.
3. Bilateral small pleural effusions and subsegmental
atelectasis with a more significant atelectasis noted within the
left lower lobe posterior basal segment.
4. Intra-abdominal ascites.
5. Coronary and aortic vascular calcifications.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo female with h/o asthma presented to OSH with asthma flare
found to have new pancreatic [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further w/u.
.
# ASTHMA FLARE:  She has h/o asthma which had been inactive for
several years until recently she had 3 hospitalization within
the past few months for asthma flare.  Twice she was intubated
including this recent hospitalization at OSH before transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2147-3-24**].  PFTs from OSH demonstrated clear obstructive
picture.  On transfer here, her respiratory status was improving
and she was kept on nebs and finished a course of antibiotics
while her steroids were weaned off.  Then she decompesated on
[**2147-3-31**] with tachypnea and increased work of breathing.  She was
admitted to the MICU for closer observation and required brief
period of bipap.  CTA was negative for PE and there was
questionable pneumonia.  She was put on steroids again and was
started on a course of levofloxacin.  She was transferred back
on the regular medicine service on [**2147-4-3**] when he respiratory
status stabilized once again and was followed by pulmonary
consult team.  She was on room air on discharge, and she should
continue standing xopenex/ipratroprium nebs.  She should also
continue montelukast, advair and a long steroid taper starting
with prednisone 40mg daily x 1 week and tapering by 5mg each
week.  She recieved 6 days of Levofloxacin and Pulmonary consult
agreed with stopping abx.
.
Of note, sputum culture grew out MRSA on [**2147-4-4**] but this was
felt to be from colonization since she currently does not have
signs and symptoms of PNA: afebrile and stable on room air
without cough or sputum.
.
Apparently, RAST at OSH was positive for dust mites.  Her ANCA
was negative.  Bedside evaluation from speech and swallow did
not demonstrate aspiration.
.
She has followup at Pulmonary Clinic on [**6-5**] for management
of her chronic asthma.
.
# PANCREAS: During workup for her asthma flare at OSH, her
pancreas was imaged for unclear reasons.  The CT report reads:
"Extensive cystic change throughout the pancreas and
peripancreatic soft tissue.  This is most suggestive of
pancreatic pseudocyst formation with associated phlegmonous
tisse and presumed acute pancreatitis.  A cystic neoplasm,
however, cannot be excluded and would be reason within the
different diagnosis.  The cystic formation is somewhat more
extensive than previously seen."  There was no elevated in
amylase and lipase and her biliary ducts were normal.  CA [**58**]-9
was normal.  She was initially put on bowel rest and TPN per
recommendations from the ERCP team.  Later, she was transitioned
to a diet and tolerated that without a problem.  Surgery was
consulted and felt that there was no urgent need for surgery at
this time.  She needs to follow up as an outpatient and has a
scheduled appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in surgery on [**4-14**].
.
There was a concern from the pulmonary team that this could be
autoimmune pancreatitis because there may be a link to asthma.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] from GI was consulted and agreed with the possibilty
given her asymptomatic presentation of pancreatitis.  IgG4
levels and CFRT mutation panel were sent and were pending at
discharge.  She will taper her steroids slowly starting at 40mg
daily and tapering down by 5mg each week.  She has followup
arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**] 0n [**4-25**].
.
# DM II: managed with RISS and glargine 8 U at bedtime.  Since
she is on steroids, her blood sugars have some variation.  She
will need outpatient follow up also.
.
# Hyperlipidemia - conitinued PO lipitor.
.
# HTN - continued diltiazem.
.
# Anxiety - continued zolpidem and lorazepam.
