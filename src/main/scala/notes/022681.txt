STUDIES:
[**1-24**] CXR: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained
demonstrating no
signs of pneumonia or CHF. Mild bronchial wall cuffing is noted
on lateral
view which could indicate mild airways disease. No pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax is seen. The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
normal. The
imaged osseous structures are intact. There is no free air below
the right
hemidiaphragm.

IMPRESSION: Mild bronchial wall cuffing, ?? bronchitis. No lobar

consolidation.

[**1-25**]: Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural surfaces


Brief Hospital Course:
20 year old male with past medical history of mild intermittent
asthma admitted with one week history of productive cough and
fever of [**Age over 90 **] yesterday, SOB, consistent with asthma
exacerbation, now on antibitoics, tamiflu, and prednisone with
improved symptoms and good O2 saturation.
.
#. Asthma exacerbation: Likly trigger poorly controlled
baseline, on top of recent viral infection/bronchitis/CAP.
Influenza rapid test was negative.  Patient was transferred to
the floor later on the day of admission.  On the floor, patient
was afebrile with no SOB.  Antibitoics were discontinued.  Peak
flow improved to 300 on morning of discharge and did not
decrease with ambulation.  He was discharged with albuterol
nebulizers, prednisone 60 mg x 5 days, and advair 250/50 [**Hospital1 **].
Because CXR showed possible peribronchial cuffing it was
recommended he have pulmonary f/up after discharge for workup of
ABPA.
.
#. Elevated INR: INR 1.4 on admission, decreased to 1.2 on
discharge. Unclear etiology, LFTs all normal.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen in the hospital because of a severe asthma
exacerbation.  This was likely caused by poorly controlled
asthma symptoms and a viral illness.  Flu tests were still
pending by the time of your discharge.  Your symptoms improved
with nebulizers and steroids.  You will stay on prednisone 5
more days, or until you see you primary care doctor.  Your
asthma was likely worsened by a viral bronchitis.  You did not
have influenza or pneumonia.
.
We are starting you on an asthma medication called Advair.  This
medication is called an asthma "controller" medication in that
it helps to prevent you coming to the hospital for asthma in the
long term.  Thus, it is important that you take this Inhaler
twice a day, even when you are not experiencing symptoms.
Please make sure to gargle water after using the advair inhalers
to prevent a fungal infection in your mouth.  You should
continue to take albuterol inhalers as needed when you are
having symptoms, but the advair inhaler should help decrease the
amount that you need to take the inhaler.
.
DO NOT RETURN TO WORK AT STARBUCKS UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR PRIMARY
CARE DOCTOR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] THIS WEEK.
.
We also recommend that you discuss with your primary care doctor
seeing a pulmonologist to help manage your asthma.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
STARTED Advair 250/50 1 puff twice a day
STARTED Prednisone 3 x 20 mg (60 mg total) per day for 5 days
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay.

Followup Instructions:
You have been seen at the [**Hospital 778**] clinic in the past.  Please
call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 798**] tomorrow morning to make an appointment to see
