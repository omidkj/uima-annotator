[**12-28**] Chest X-ray:
1. Endotracheal tube should be retracted approximately 1.5 cm.
This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by telephone at 8:15
p.m.
2. Left upper lung zone opacity, which may correspond with the
patient's known history of pulmonary embolism. Please correlate
with cross sectional imaging.
.
[**12-28**] Head Ct:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No mass effect
.
[**12-28**] LENIS:
No evidence of DVT.
.
[**12-28**] CTA from OSH: CD reviewed with in-house radiology: thrombus
is RU and RM and RL segmental pulm arteries.  Also in left main
and [**Doctor Last Name **] segmental pulm artery.  No signs of recannulization.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo female with massive bilateral PE s/p thrombolysis at OSH.
.
# PE: She remained hemodynamically stable during the entire
hospital course at [**Hospital1 18**].  She was extubated in the MICU without
complications and then transferred to Medicine for futher care.
Her oxygen requirement was weaned, and she was able to ambulate
with PT on room air without shortness of breath, saturating >90%
on room air.
.
She was put on heparin gtt and coumadin for anticoagulation.
Her INR was therapeutic x 2 days (INR [**1-17**]) before heparin gtt
was stopped.  Of note, she was started on coumadin 5mg daily.
Her INR started to trend up from 1.1 to 1.7 to 2.2 to 2.7 (day
of discharge).  On day of discharge, since her INR has been
climbing daily, we lowered her dose to 3mg a day.  She will
continue coumadin as outpatient and has an appointment with her
PCP to [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u her INR.  She will likely need long term or lifelong
anticoagulation.
.
She did not have any bleeding s/p lysis and on anticoagulation.
Head CT negative.  Guaiac negative.  Serial neurologic exam were
all normal.
.
The reason for her developing massive PE is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] mother
has unexplained DVTs but that is her only risk factor.
Hypercoagulable workup labs including factor 5 leiden,
antithrombin III, lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid
antibodies, homocysteiene were sent and should be followed up as
an outpatient.  Malignancy workup is differed to her PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]
talked to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71267**] (PCP).  She has never had a colonoscopy.
 She had mammograms in the past: right breast nodular lesion
discovered on [**2198-3-19**], stable on mammograms [**2199-5-10**] and
[**2200-10-8**].  Birads score of 1, no evidence of malignancy.
.
# LEUKOCYTISIS: She had leukocytosis that trended down during
this hospital course.  There as no bandemia.  She has no fever
or localizing signs of infection.  UA was negative.
Leukocytosis likely [**1-16**] steroids received at OSH + stress
response to PE.
.
# TACHYCARDIA: She had that was attributed to dehydration.  She
felt thirsty and her BUN/Cr ratio was elevated.  Her tachycardia
improved with IVF and oral hydration.  Also possibly a component
from PE clot burden that should resolve with anticoagulation.
.
# HTN:  She was restarted on her outpatient dose of lisinopril
20mg daily once her bp normalized.
.
# URINARY INCONTINENCE:  She has had this in the past.  Possibly
exacerbated by foley.  No UTI by UA.  Follow up as outpatient.
