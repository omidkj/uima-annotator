Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxic respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 yo F with dementia, mental retardation, diastolic
CHF, restrictive lung disease, recurrent pnas, h/o intubation,
anemia, who presents with hypoxic respiratory distress.  Pt was
found to be in acute respiratory distress at her [**Hospital3 **]
facility with O2 sats in the 40s. Apparently the pt had been
noted to have severe lethary and wheezing at her [**Hospital 4382**].  She was placed on 100%NRB at her facility and was then
brought to ED.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be satting at 46%on RA and 91-100%NRB,
T98.5, HR 90, BP 165/76, RR22.  She appeared to be in
respiratory distress with dusky cyanotic hands.  Pt was
confused, disoriented, agitated and was placed in restraints.
She was given A/A nebs, solumedrol, levofloxacin 500 mg IV x1,
Vancomycin 1gm IV x1.  Initial ABG revealed: 7.34/72/96 on 100%
NRB.  She had a WBC of 14 with 92%PMN.  CXR revealed RLL
atelectasis vs infiltrate.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2110-8-19**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal

with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2109-3-22**], the
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission to the ICU, the pt was satting in the 80s on both
RA and 4LNC.  Her ABG revealed: 7.33/62/62/34 with A-a gradient
of 95. Pt was started on a 500 cc bolus of NS and then D51/2 at
70 cc/hr. Pts sats dropped back down to 79% on 4LNC.  She was
given combivent neb and suctioned, bringing her O2 sat back up
to 96% on 50%FIO2.  Repeat ABG: 7.31/65/74 with A-a of 135.
Fluids were stopped and stat CXR revealed likely volume
overload.  BNP came back 5793 and pt was given Lasix 20 mg IVx1,
[**12-1**] inch nitropaste, hydral 10 mg po. Her abx were changed from
ceftriaxone/azithro to zosyn given possibility of nosocomial
infxn.  Vancomycin was continued to cover for aspiration PNA.
On the morning after admission, it was decided to again stop
diuresis and start gentle hydration.  It was felt the pt was
initially dry on admission, leading to her hypernatremia, ARF.
She likely became volume overloaded in the setting of the NS
bolus of 500 cc over 1 hr.  Following that fluid bolus, her Na
did improve to 144.  She was restarted on NS at 100 cc/hr for 1
L.  The hydralazine was discontinued and the diltiazem was
continued to maximize filling time.  She was then discharged to
the floor and was intermittantly hypoxic on RA with sats between
88 - 95%. Therefore she needs rehab for pulmonary toilet.
.
# Hypoxic Resp Distress/Hypercarbic Respiratory
Distress/Respiratory acidosis:  Ddx on admission--noscomial PNA,
aspiration pna, CHF, PE, ?contribution from chronic lung dx.
Leading dx is probably combination of aspiration and CHF.  Pt
admitted with radiologic signs of a PNA.  She was treated with
Levofloxacin, Vanc, and Solumedrol in the ED.  D dimer elevated
to 556, however pt with stable hemodynamics and no other
evidence of PE.  Pts volume status is unclear by PE, however BNP
elevation to 5793 assists in dx of CHF.  A-a gradient of 95, up
to 135 after volume overload. Ruled out for an MI.  We continued
empiric treatment for nosocomial and asp PNA with Zosyn; add
Vanc 1gm IV q48 hr given likely asp PNA. Diltiazem was continued
for rate control to improve diastolic dysfunction.  She was
given A/A nebs prn.  On the night of admission the pt satted
upper 80s-90s on 50%VM.
The pt developed hypercarbic resp distress and was intubated the
am of [**1-
