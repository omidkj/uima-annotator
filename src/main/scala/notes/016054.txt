Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
Elevated WBC, ESR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none performed

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with h/o diastolic heart failure and recent
admission for endocarditis c/b heart block and bradycardia s/p
temporary pacer placement who presented to the ED at the request
of his ID physician due to elevated WBC and ESR.
.
He was admitted [**Date range (3) 50936**] with group B strep endocarditis
(probable mitral valve).  He was initially treated with
vancomycin and was then desensitized to penicillin with plan for
6 weeks of treatment.  Course was complicated by type I second
degree AV block and temporary pacer was placed with plans to
eventually internalize pacer.  He was discharged to [**Hospital **]
rehab.  He was treated with IV penicillin for 7-8 weeks until
[**9-10**] when he was changed to oral suppressive clindamycin (150mg
po q12h) and his PICC line was pulled.
.
He had an ID OPAT visit yesterday.  Labs showed a WBC 18.5 and
ESR 125 despite treatment.  Therefore, he was referred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for admission from [**Hospital **] Rehab in [**Hospital1 **].  There were plans
to internalize his pacemaker in the near future (some reports
say tomorrow).
.
He complains of cough productive of clear sputum.  Denies fevers
but does have night chills occasionally.  Denies CP or SOB.  No
abdominal pain or diarrhea.  Denies urinary symptoms but comes
with indwelling foley.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.2 75 90/50 16 98%RA.  UA was
grossly positive.  ECG was unchanged from prior.  Physical exam
showed a 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the base.  Repeat CBC
showed WBC 9.9 with creatinine 1.4 from baseline 1.0.  Blood and
urine cx sent.  CXR unremarkable.  He was given vancomycin and
ceftriaxone.  Has 18g IV.
.
ROS: Denies headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion,
sore throat, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena,
hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

Studies:
ECG [**2179-9-22**]: Atrial fibrillation. Voltage for left ventricular
hypertrophy. Non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2179-7-25**]
there is no
significant change.
.
CXR [**2179-9-22**]: Small left pleural effusion with mild pulmonary
edema.
.
TTE [**2179-9-23**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. The mitral
valve leaflets are elongated. There is moderate/severe bileaflet
mitral valve prolapse (posterior > anterior leaflet). An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Tricuspid valve prolapse is present. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known lastname 50937**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with h/o recent group B strep
MV endocarditis complicated by heart block who presents with
elevated WBC and ESR at [**Hospital **] clinic.  He was admitted for workup
of his elevated inflammatory markers, with concern for recurrent
endocarditis
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Endocarditis: There was concern for recurrent endocarditis
[**Name13 (STitle) 50938**] elevated WBC and ESR and recent history,
although he also had a positive UA and was not acutely ill.
Additionally, he was admitted with pacer wires that could
potentially be [**Known lastname 50939**] could also have persistent
vegetation on his valves, although repeat TTE did not show any
new growth.  While admitted, [**Known lastname 50937**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] extraction of
his temporary pacemaker leads and was switched to IV Vancomycin.
 His blood cultures remained negative, but there remained
concern for recurrent endocarditis.  In the CCU, [**Known lastname 50937**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8783**] successfuly desensitization to pencillin G, after
which he was treated with 3 million units IV q6 hours, which
will be continued for 4-6 weeks.  He will follow up with ID and
OPAT in the outpatient setting.
.
# Urinary tract infection: [**Known lastname 50937**] had a grossly positive UA
on admission and it was noted that his indwelling foley had not
been changed for 6 weeks while at his rehab facility.  His foley
was removed
