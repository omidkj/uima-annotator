Brief Hospital Course:
60yoF with HTN on ACEi with acute onset of upper lip swelling
likely due to ACEi, who was treated with steroids, Benadryl,
with improvement in the swelling. ACEi was discontinued.

1. Angioedema: Pt had been on ACEi for five years before but per
Allergy consult, can see this up to 10 years. Pt was admitted to
MICU for airway monitoring but had no respiratory symptoms
through admission and was stable. Started on scheduled Benadryl
and oral Prednisone after having gotted 1 dose of IV Solumedrol.
Her lip swelling improved by discharge and vitals were stable.

Allergy was consulted and thought this classic for ACEi given
pt's age and race, that there was no associated itching and that
the swelling was not significantly improved with steroids given
that the ACEi reaction is bradykinin mediated.

She was discharged to complete a 1 week course of Prednisone,
tapered as below under discharge medications. She was instructed
to follow up with her outpt [**Hospital1 **] allergist who knows
her well. ACEi was discontinued and pt was started on Metoprolol
for bp control instead. She was instructed that she should
discuss with her PCP and allergist whether to start [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]. She
was also discharged with a Rx for Ranitidine which was started
in house, and also a Rx for Epi pens.

2. Hypertension: Stopped ACEi as above and started on Metoprolol
for bp control. Instructed to f/u with PCP/allergist about
starting [**Last Name (un) **] in the future.

3. DM: Pt on Metformin and Glyburide which were held while
admitted and blood sugars controlled with insulin however these
were restarted on discharge.
