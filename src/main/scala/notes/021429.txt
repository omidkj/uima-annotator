Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral PE, recent SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 1794**] is a 69 year old with past medical history significant
for multiple prior Deep Vein Thrombosis, Pulmonary Emboli, L.
hip replacement and recent CVA, presenting from OSH ([**Hospital 6451**] Hospital) with bilateral pulmonary emboli. He was
recently discharged from the NSG service on [**2142-2-19**] s/p SDH
evacuation to Rehab.

Regarding the pt's [**2-13**] - [**2-19**] admission: he was admitted to NSG
at [**Hospital1 18**] after he had complained of a headache for several days
and had multiple episodes of vomiting. His head CT revealed a
large left SDH. He was taken to the OR on [**2142-2-13**] for a Left
craniotomy for SDH evacuation. He became febrile to 101.8 early
am on [**2142-2-15**], sputum cultures were positive for Gram + cocci in
pairs, and LENIS showed a Left superficial femoral DVT that was
determined to be a new partially occlusive DVT (with the pt's
last documented DVT having occured in [**2139**], after which he was
begun on Coumadin 6mg daily). No anticoagulation was safe to be
administered in the immediate post-operative setting of
SDH/surgery. SQ heparin on HD2 and levofloxacin 4d course was
started in the setting of low grade fever and sputum with gram +
cocci. Pt was discharged to rehab [**2142-2-19**] on Heparin 5,000
unit/mL TID, and instructed to hold coumadin until [**2142-2-26**].
While at rehab, he had sudden onset SOB at PT on [**2142-2-23**]. He was
taken to an OSH and had a CTA that demonstrated large PEs in
both main pulmonary arteries and segmental branches with RV
dilitation. The patient was started on a Hep gtt at the OSH,
with a large bolus (8700 units) and was continued on Heparin
gtt. He was trasfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with initial VS 99, 135/94, 97,
24, 97% on [**10-16**] 100% FiO2 on BiPap.

[**2142-2-23**] TTE: IMPRESSIONS: Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2142-2-19**], the right ventricle is now mildly dilated
with moderate free wall hypokinesis and there is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitaiton
is also now seen.

[**2142-2-23**] CCATH: FINAL DIAGNOSIS:1. Successful insertion of
retrievable Optease IVC filter via RCFV approach 2. Continue
Heparin gtt and maintain therapeutic aPTT 3. Careful
neurological assessment and follow up brain CT scan given
history of SDH.

[**2142-2-23**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Right
bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2142-2-21**] the rate has increased. There is
inferolateral upsloping ST segment depression.

[**2142-2-23**] CT HEAD: 1. Unchanged or slightly smaller multifocal
extra-axial hemorrhage as described above. Other areas of
hemorrhage as described above. Follwo up as clinically
indicated. 2. Hypoattenuation in the left parietal lobe, likely
represents evolving subacute infarct.
[**2142-2-23**] LENIs: Bilateral common femoral and right deep femoral
venous thrombosis.

[**2142-3-1**] CTA torso: IMPRESSION: 1. New multifocal areas of
ground-glass opacity within bilateral lung parenchyma most
compatible with infectious etiology. 2. Mildly decreased extent
of bilateral pulmonary embolism within the right and left
pulmonary arteries extending into the segmental and subsegmental
branches. 3. Fluid collection and enlargement of the left hip
abductor muscles may represent hematoma, abscess, or infarction.
This is also at the location of previous interventions in the
left groin for IVC filter placement. Clinical correlation is
recommended. In case of clinical concern for abscess formation,
an MRI can be obtained for further evaluation. 4. Renal cysts,
liver cysts and enlarged prostate.

Echo [**2142-3-2**]:
Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
The RV is now well seen but appears normal in size (function
cannot be adequately assessed on this study). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but
cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-2-21**], RV
apppears smaller however images are of poor quality.

[**2142-3-2**] Femoral vascular ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:
1. Hematoma at the left groin.
2. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm arising from the left common
femoral artery.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


[**2142-3-2**] Hip 2 view:
HISTORY: Hip prosthesis and fluid collection, evaluate for
abscess or bone
destruction. Four views. Comparison with [**2138-1-17**]. A left hip
prosthesis remains in place.  Cortical margins are otherwise
intact. Bony mineralization appears normal.  Surgical clips are
present in overlying soft tissues. Incidental note is made of
degenerative changes in the spine.
IMPRESSION: Status post THR. No definite interval change.

[**2142-3-3**] CXR:
HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism. Hypoxia.
One portable upright view. Comparison with the previous study
done [**2142-3-1**].  There is streaky density at the left lung base
consistent with subsegmental atelectasis and/or parenchymal
consolidation as before. The right lung remains clear. The heart
and mediastinal structures are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No significant change.

[**2142-3-4**] portable abdomen:
ONE PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW: The upper abdomen and lateral
abdominal walls are not included. Comparison is made with the
previous study done [**2142-2-19**].
Dilated air-filled loops of colon are again demonstrated down to
the level of the sigmoid colon. Some gas is noted in the region
of the lower sigmoid colon and rectum. Degenerative changes are
again demonstrated in the spine and the left hip prosthesis
remains in place.
IMPRESSION:
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern, which may represent colonic
ileus.

[**2142-3-6**] MRI pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. 11.6 x 5.0 cm rim-enhancing fluid collection invo
