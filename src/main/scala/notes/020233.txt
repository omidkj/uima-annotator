Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2173-7-21**]: [**Month/Day/Year **] with sphincterotomy, stent placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] had undergone a right hepatic lobectomy on [**2173-6-18**]
and had been recovering well: he was discharged with a JP drain
in place as it was producing greater than 50-70cc per day of
fairly bilious output. He presented for [**Date Range **] on [**2173-7-21**] to
evaluate for possible biliary leak and received both
sphincterotomy and stent placement in the main duct; contrast
extravasation was noted at the level of the intrahepatics
without clear localization of the leak. Pre-procedure the
patient was noted per report to have a blood pressure in the
80's systolic, though he was mentating well. Peri-procedurally,
he became hypotensive to the 60's systolic without evidence of
hemodynamic instability. He was resuscitated with upwards of 5L
of crystalloid and was placed on Neosynephrine and transferred
to the SICU for further monitoring.

Pertinent Results:
Diagnostics:

[**2173-7-21**]: ECG:
Sinus bradycardia. Prior inferior myocardial infarction. Q-T
interval
prolongation. Non-specific inferior ST-T wave changes. Compared
to the
previous tracing of [**2173-6-24**] the rate has slowed, the Q-T
interval is
prolonged. Clinical correlation is suggested.

[**2173-7-21**]: CXR:
 Small right pleural effusion unchanged since [**7-14**], right
infrahilar
consolidation increased, most likely atelectasis.  Lungs are
otherwise clear.  No appreciable left pleural effusion.  Heart
size normal.  No free subdiaphragmatic gas.  Right upper
quadrant drain and biliary catheter in place, not fully
evaluated by this examination.

[**2173-7-22**]: TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection
fraction 40 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis with focal
akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior free wall, and
posterior wall. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2173-7-25**]: TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral
wall and akinesis in the remainder of the LV (LVEF = 10%). A
left ventricular mass/thrombus is not seen but cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
hyperkinesis of the basal free wall but mid-to-distal wall
severe hypokinesis to akinesis (with slight contraction of RV
apex). The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial to very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2173-7-25**]: CT abdomen-pelvis:
New large right and moderate left pleural effusions.
Diffuse reticular opacities in the left lung and right middle
lobe, which
likely represent infection and less likely asymmetric edema.
Pulmonary nodules, many of which are obscured by pleural
effusions.
Recommend continued followup once acute disease resolves.
Status post right hepatic lobectomy with surgical drain and a
CBD stent in place. Status post colectomy. Extensive vascular
disease with a small infrarenal aortic ectasia/aneurysm.
Anasarca.

Within the right lower quadrant, located anterior to the right
psoas muscle abutting the IVC anterolaterally, is a reniform
collection of fluid measuring approximately 4.7 x 9.8 x 3.1 cm
(transverse x CC x AP), which could represent a seroma, biloma,
or fluid collection.  There is no pelvic side wall or inguinal
lymphadenopathy by size criteria.

[**2173-7-30**]: CT abdomen-pelvis:
Fluid collections seen anterior to the right psoas is ascitic in
nature.
Marked volume overload marked by bilateral pleural effusions,
slightly increased on the left since prior, moderate ascites and
anasarca.


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 11679**] was admitted to the SICU post [**Known lastname **] for
hypotension.  He was entirely asymptomatic from his hypotension
(except UOP was pressure dependent and his Cr did trend up) yet
required levophed to maintain his SBP in the 90s (and maintain
adequate urine output).  He was started on midodrine PO and
slowly weaned from the levophed.  An echocardiogram demonstrated
an EF of 40% but no apparent acute changes.  He was eventually
weaned from the levophed entirely, hemodynamically stable (on
midodrine) and transferred to the floor on HD2.

Unfortunately, later that evening, he became hypoxic to an SaO2
of the 80% with tachypnea to the 30s and tachycardia to the
140s.  CXR demonstrated new pulmonary edema versus consolidation
and he was transferred back to the ICU for further monitoring
and resuscitation where he was intubated shortly after transfer
for persistent tachypnea and excessive work of breathing.  He
became hypotensive and required triple pressor therapy to ensure
adequate hemodynamics.  An echocardiogram demonstrated a new EF
of 10% and there were mild but unimpressive troponin rise
(cardiology felt was all demand ischemia and the depressed
cardiac function was directly related to an inflammatory
state....sepsis). A CT scan did not show any acute
intraabdominal process (fluid related to ongoing bile drainage
present) but did show impressive bilateral ground glass
reticular appearance to the lung.  He was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics to treat the presumed source (pneumonia)
and a few days later sputum culture/BAL demonstrated [**Female First Name (un) **] and
he was started on fungal coverage with micafungin.  He improved
rapidly thereafter.  There were some changes to his pressor
regimen (levophed, vasopressin, dobutamine initially, then
transitioned to levo-vaso-milrinone) before he was ultimately
able to be successfully weaned.  The vent was in the process of
being wea
