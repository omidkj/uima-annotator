Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yoF w/ h/o mult asp PNA, recently dx UTI, dementia, prior CVA
admit with decreased MS [**1-22**] hypernatremia.
.
1) Hypernatremia: Initial Na 168.  Presentation consistent with
loss of hypotonic fluid with decreased free H20 intake/access
due to being non-ambulatory (wheelchair bound).  Patient was
aggressively hydrated with slow correction of sodium to within
normal limits, with improvement in mental status.  At time of
her discharge, her sodium was back to baseline 140.
.
2) Decreased MS: Thought to be multifactorial including
hypernatremia and urinary infection.  Had Head CT on admission,
negative for acute bleed.  Pt also with underlying dementia,
which is unchanged.  Her medications for dementia were
discontinued during her hospitalization.  At this time, we did
not feel we should restart these meds; this can be discussed
with her outpatient physician.
.
3) UTI: Pt w/ h/o recurrent UTIs, with U/A on admission
consistent with UTI; however, urine culture taken the same day
was contaminated.  Given patient's past h/o infections with ESBL
resistant organisms was placed on meropenem x 5 days.  F/u U/A,
urine cultures showed clearance of infection, so antibiotics
were d/c after 5 days.  (There was concern that meropenem was
contributing to her LFT abnormalities/thrombocytopenia, so a
prolonged course was not favored.  Given a nl U/A/urine culture,
we felt comfortable d/c her antibiotics).
***PLEASE NOTE, pt had a U/A, urine culture sent on the day of
discharge given her h/o recurrent UTIs.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending
on the case, will follow up on the results and report if
treatment is required.
.
4) EKG changes/Afib: Patient had EKG changes, new from baseline.
 Was r/o for MI in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]; had mild TPN leak thought [**1-22**]
demand ischemia from dehydration/infection.
Aspirin was held in setting of low platelets.  No further
work-up was pursued.
.
5) Thrombocytopenia:
Pt with low nl platelets in the past, with decreased platelets
during her hospitalization.  Meropenem was implicated, and d/c
as soon as f/u U/A, urine cultures were negative.  HIT Ab was
negative.  On day of discharge, platelets were back to her
baseline, low 100s.
.
6) Abnl LFTs: Had transaminitis w/elevated LDH/Alk Phos and nl
bilirubin.  RUQ u/s showed sludge but no stones/cholecystitis.
Abnormalities were thought ? [**1-22**] meds (meropenem), but not
entirely clear.  Still following with slow resolution of
abnormalities; patient asymptomatic.
.
7) F/E/N: Pt w/ recurrent aspirations on pureed solids at
nursing home.  Had bedside speech/swallow evaluation which
confirmed this propensity.  Recommended nectar thickened
liquids/aspiration precautions.  Please, please make sure
patient eats/drinks to avoid hypernatremia.  Given her
wheel-chair bound status, she cannot get her own fluids.  If she
is not eating, she will need D5 1/2NS maintenance IVF to avoid
dehydration/hypernatremia.
***If patient is not eating for several days, may need to
re-discuss the issue of a feeding tube with patient's health
care proxy/son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 97130**].
.
8) Proph: Pneumoboots; No heparin/H2 blockers/PPI in setting of
low platelets.
***Aggressive bowel regimen (daily colace/senna unless patient
has diarrhea; add bisacodyl/lactulose if patient not having BM x
2 days) as has needed disimpaction in past.
.
9) DNR/DNI: HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (son) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 97131**]
.
10) Access-Patient was not eating well during her
hospitalization and required IVF.  She had a PICC line placed on
day of discharge [**2177-3-21**] for IVF as needed
