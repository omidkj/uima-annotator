Final Report
PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**2106-8-23**]
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**8-21**],
preoperative chest radiograph:
Small bilateral pleural effusion is new. Severe cardiomegaly is
unchanged.  Atelectasis in the left mid lung is changed in
distribution but not in overall severity. No pulmonary edema or
pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3891**]
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe anterior, inferior mid to
apical hypokinesis.. The remaining left ventricular segments are
hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild to
moderate ([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IABP in good position.

POST CPB:
1. Mildly improved global and focal LV systolic function.
2. Preserved RV systolci function.
3. Mitral regurgitation is mild to moderate.
4. With improved cardiac output the [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 19367**] [**Location (un) 109**] measured to
be 1.7 cm2
5. Persistent wall motion abnormalities (Inferior/anteroseptal
severe hypokinesis)
5. Persistent wall motion abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted for cardiac cath from ER [**8-18**] with NSTEMI. IABP placed
in the cath lab due to extensive coronary disease. Taken
emergently from cath lab to OR for surgery with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] that
evening. Transferred to the CVICU in fair condition on titrated
epinephrine, phenylephrine, and propofol drips. IABP removed and
extubated POD #1.Transferred to the floor on POD #2 Her activity
level was gradually advanced. Chest tubes and pacing wires
removed per protocol. Beta blockade titrated and gently diuresed
toward pre-op weight. Made excellent progress and cleared for
discharge to home on POD #6. Pt. is to make all follow-up appts.
