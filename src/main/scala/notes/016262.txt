with stable vital signs.  HEENT:  Normal.  Neck:  Supple.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was fully evaluated
preoperatively for this procedure.  The patient at this time
had gone through the full preoperative evaluation for liver
donation and was consented and informed of the risks of this
procedure and brought to the Operating Room on [**2136-5-21**].
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to
the floor after a stay in the PACU and  was in stable
condition with a hematocrit of 33.3, white blood cell count
of 10.9, and a platelet count of 200,000.  The rest of the

and on [**2136-5-25**], postoperative day number four, the
patient's bilirubin total was 2.1, alkaline phosphatase 85,

to trend steadily downward  from this time and on [**2136-5-26**], his AST was 82 and his ALT was 358.

The patient's main issue during his stay was pain control.

three day course was given, resulting in good pain relief for
the patient.

vital signs were stable.  His physical examination revealed
the patient to be in no apparent distress with a soft and
nontender abdomen throughout.  One of the two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
