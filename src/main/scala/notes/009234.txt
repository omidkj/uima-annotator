Chief Complaint:
Angioedema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/extubation

History of Present Illness:
68 yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, CRI and HTN presents
from OSH with angioedema of tongue.

Pt noticed angioedema at 7:30 pm on [**9-23**]. He had no trouble
breathing but noted dysarthria and drooling, as well as the
sensation that he could not keep his tongue in his mouth. He had
no recently prescribed meds, but had restarted lisinopril 2.5mg
in [**4-11**] per his PCP. (Of note, per his home pharmacy, he only
filled the prescription on [**2119-9-16**], but per the [**Hospital1 2025**] pharmacy, he
filled the prescription both in [**2119-6-8**], as well as in
[**2119-1-8**]. The patient cannot supply more history.) He also
started terazosin [**6-11**]. The patient had also taken one sip of
cough medicine the night before the event. He denies new foods,
shellfish, or berries. On specific questioning, the patient
reported a new cough for 2 days prior to the episode.
*
The patient was originally taken to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital, where his
initial O2 sat was 95%RA.  He was started on empiric steroids
(solumedrol and decadron), benadryl, zantac, epi 0.3 sc, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] later in the evening.
*
On arrival at the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient felt that the swelling was
slightly increased. O2 sat was 97-98%2L and he had no stridor.
ENT performed a scope and noted some swelling of soft palate
without vocal cord swelling. Re-scope 30 minutes later showed
bilateral edema of false vocal cord. An elective intubation for
airway protection was performed in the ER (early AM [**9-24**]).
*
The angioedema was considered to be due to a lisinopril allergy.
Over a 3-day MICU stay, the patient was treated with solumedrol,
benadryl, and famotidine IV. He was seen by the allergy and
renal teams. His acute on chronic renal failure was considered
secondary to a brief episode of hypotension (unclear whether
this occurred at OSH or in transit), while his underlying CRF
was considered secondary both to HTN and due to atheroemboli
after his CABG (there was a rapid increase in Cr after CABG).
His Cr on arrival was 4.9; this rose to 5.8 on [**9-24**], then fell.
The sequelae of his renal failure were treated as follows: The
patient's hyperkalemia was treated with kayexelate. His
metabolic acidosis was treated with bicitra 30cc [**Hospital1 **]. His
hyperphosphatemia was treated with Renagel. It was noted that
the patient had previously been on Epo. The patient's HTN was
also a problem, and he was treated with metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], then
with labetolol and nitrate drips. On [**2119-9-27**], the pateitn was
noted to be tachycardic in the setting of T 100.1, on steroids.
CXR showed early infiltrate/aspiration PNA, and sputum sample
showed GNR. Ucx from [**2119-9-15**] likely d/t contamination.
*
On [**9-26**], the patient was extubtated. On [**2119-9-27**], he was
transferred from the ICU to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68yo M with PMH significant for CAD s/p MI '[**08**] and CABG
[**3-12**], HTN, and CRF, transferred [**2119-9-27**] from the MICU, after
presentation on [**9-23**] with angioedema likely d/t lisinopril
allergy, s/p intubation for airway protection and extubation
[**2119-9-26**].
*
1. Resolving angioedema. Was on solumedrol 80mg IV q8, benadryl,
and famotidine IV in ICU.
- [**9-27**]: Changed solumedrol 80mg IV q8 to prenisone 80mg po
taper over 8 days.
- Continued famotidine and benadryl IV initially on the floor,
then d/c'ed these [**9-29**].
- C4 and C1 inhibitor function, CH50, serum tryptase - pending
at the time of discharge.
- Counseled the patient against using ACEI or [**Last Name (un) 11823**].
- F/u appt made with allergy and with PCP.
.
2. HTN. Was on nitro and labetalol drips in unit until noon
[**9-27**].
- Metoprolol 100po tid, amlodipine 10po qd, isosorbide dinitrate
20mg po tid.
- Added hydral 50mg po q6 on transfer to floor; increased it on
[**9-29**] to 50po q6, and on [**9-30**] to 75po q6. Increased it on [**10-1**]
to 100po q6 and pt had low BP's and felt dizzy --> Back to 75mg
po q6.
- 40mg lasix [**Hospital1 **]
*
3. ID. Pt with mild SOB. CXR showed possible PNA. Endotracheal
sputum from [**9-25**] showed GNR and GPC in pairs, which was
confirmed to be H. flu.
- PNA: Initially treated empirically with vanc (renal dose 1mg
q48h) and zosyn (2.25mg IV q8h). When culture data became
available, vanc was d/c'ed. The patient was changed from zosyn
to augmentin po.
- BACTEREMIA: Low grade temps (high 100.1) on [**2119-9-27**]. Bcx
showed GPC in pairs, chains, and clusters in [**1-9**] bottles.
Culture data showed Group B strep. The patient was maintained on
augmentin for coverage of GBS bacteremia as well.
- Two sets of surveillance cultures were negative afterwards.
- The patient was kept in the hospital an extra day as the WBC
increased to 21, but the patient remained well-appearing and
afebrile.
*
4. CRF/ARF. Pt has had progressive renal failure, with
creatinine increasing from 2.2 in [**2-9**] to 3.9 (baseline on
admission, from [**2119-8-9**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]). Rapidly progressing renal
failure from [**2-9**] to [**8-12**] after CABG likely due to ateroemboli
with underlying renovascular disease/HTN nephrosclerosis.
Additional ARF on this admission, to a peak of Cr 5.8 was likely
secondary to a transient episode of hypotenion with decreased
renal perfusion. Negative for urine eo's. Foley was d/c'ed on
[**9-27**] with nl U/O.
- Metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to renal failure. The
patient was initially placed on bicitra 30cc [**Hospital1 **]; this was
d/c'ed on [**9-29**].
- Pt was given lasix 40 po bid in ICU, which was increased on
transfe
