Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
74 F has hx COPD, SLE, recent SBO and resection, CAD with demand
myocardial necrosis event in [**1-5**], known systolic dysfunction
LVEF 45% last echo demonstrating inferolateral hypokinesis with
2+ MR, moderate [**Last Name (un) 6879**] w/ mild right ventricular cavity dilation,
[**2-5**] perfusion stress demonstrating medium area of myocardial
scar in the distribution of the LCX/OM coronary artery, with
mild associated peri-infarct ischemia who presents with several
days of volume overload since discharge from SBO resection being
treated at rehab with lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **], who had acute worsening
of shortness of breath yesterday morning requiring 3L NC of O2
to maintain O2 sat of 93%, no previous O2 requirement. Of note,
pt states this is how she felt during her NSTEMI event earlier
this year. She denies presence of chest pain, lightheadedness,
dizziness, palpitations, orthopnea. Endorses shortness of
breath, much worsening fatigue, typically pt very active, but
yesterday unable to do much of anything, also with cough.
.
In ED, 97.6 99 149/93 40 100% 15L nrb, got duonebs, solumedrol
125, azithromycin, tachypnea a little better, put on bipap 5/5
fi02 40% very wheezy on exam, got azithro for CHF flare, lasix
20IV. EKG demonstrated new V1, V2, V3 V4 concave down ST segment
elevation 2-3 mm which is all new compared to prior EKG,
worsened ST segment depression in V5 and V6, and worsened II,
III, and aVF ST segment depression. Pt was transferred for COPD
exacerbation. Recent vitals 80 102/64 20 100% on bipap fi02 40%

.
On arrival to [**Name (NI) 153**], pt reports feeling well, much improved
compared to earlier, breathing well on bipap. Denies chest pain.
Family reports pt with poor appetite since SBO but passing stool
and with flatus. No fevers, chills, sputum production. Given
concerning EKG changes, pt given 325 aspirin, started on
heparin, repeat EKG confirmed new changes, stat cardiology c/s
and echo performed. Echo demonstrated new LVEF 25% with moderate
to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, most
c/w multivessel CAD. Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **]
for cardiac catheterization and further evaluation of her
disease.

In the cath lab the patient was found to have a tight circumflex
and LAD lesion.  The circ lesion was felt to be the culprit
lesion.  The circ was ballooned and while trying to stent the
circ the patient went into PEA arrest.  CPR started and one
round of epi given, intubated, IABP placed and dopamine started
ROSC occurred, and dopamine stopped.  Circ was ballooned
multiple times, but difficulty getting stent deployed and LAD
went down transiently and patient pressures dropped so dopamine
started.  Patient was stabilized on 5 mcg/kg/min of dopamine.
Able to place 1 bare metal stent from left main to LAD, no circ
stents placed.  Reshooting the vessels showed good flow through
LAD, crcumflex and RCA was filling by collaterals.  Venous
sheath still in place.  During this event the patient was aware
of what was going on and was intubated for prophylaxis purposes
other than urgent need.  Transferred to the CCU for further
management.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferolateral, anterior and anteroseptal hypo- to akinesis. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, most c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-1-12**],
regional LV wall motion abnormalities in the LAD distribution
are new. The RCA (or dominant LCx)-supplied segments remain
hypokinetic. Overall LV systolic function has significantly
deteriorated. Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
1545 hours on the day of the study

PTCA COMMENTS [**2197-6-2**]:
Initial angiography showed an origin 95% stenosis of the LCx
extending
back into LMCA. After discussion with referring cardiologist, we
planned
to treat this lesion with PTCA and stenting. Heparin was
continued with
therapeutic ACT. A 5F XB LAD 3.5 guiding catheter provided
adequate
though suboptimal support for the procedure. A Prowater wire
crossed the
lesion with minimal difficulty into distal LCx. The lesion was
dilated
with a 2.5x12mm Apex RX balloon at 12 atms however a waist
remained. We
further dilated the lesion with a 2.5x8mm NC Quantum apex Mr
balloon at
10 atms without complete expansion likely due to calcification
of the
artery. We then dilated the lesion with a 2.5x10mm Angiosculpt
EX
balloon at 14 atms for 30secs. Aft
