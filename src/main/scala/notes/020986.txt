Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Cardiac surgery was consulted on
[**12-13**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The patient is a 64 year-old
female with a history of noninsulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia who presented
to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**12-12**] with exertional chest pain and
shortness of breath as well as a productive cough.  She was
found to have pneumonia clinically and was treated with
Rocephin antibiotics.  She was also found to have had a non
ST elevation myocardial infarction with peak troponin I of
14.2 and peak CK of 569.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization.
Catheterization was performed on [**12-13**] and revealed
mitral regurgitation, 50% ejection fraction, normal left
main, diffuse disease of the left anterior descending
coronary artery with a 70% mid lesion and occluded left
circumflex after the obtuse marginal one and a mid to distal
70% lesion of the right coronary artery with a probable
thrombus.  The patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of
cardiac surgery.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient did admit on review of
systems to some visual changes secondary to retinopathy and a
cough at the time residual from her treatment of pneumonia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination she is a pleasant obese
woman with a temperature of 97, heart rate 85, blood pressure
114/58, 18 respirations and satting 96% on 2 liters nasal
cannula oxygen.  Bilaterally her lungs had wheezes. Her heart
was regular rate and rhythm.  Her abdomen was obese, soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  Her
extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  She was
alert and oriented times three and grossly intact
neurologically and peripheral pulses were present throughout
carotid, radial, dorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibial
pulses bilaterally.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORIES:  Recommendations were sent that
the laboratory work be completed prior to preparation for
cardiac surgery.  White blood cell count 15.1, hematocrit
33.0, platelet count 405,000, sodium 137, K 4.7, chloride
100, bicarb 28, BUN 17, creatinine 1.1 with a blood sugar of
149, calcium 9.5, phosphorus 4.1, magnesium 1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was on a heparin drip and was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who noted her need for coronary artery
bypass graft, but no necessity of having her pulmonary
function be optimized.  The patient was followed by
cardiology and seen by case management service as she waited
coronary artery bypass graft and waited her medical fine
tuning in preparation for her operation.  Preoperative
pulmonary medicine consultation was performed on [**12-17**]
who noted the persistent bronchitis and probable
bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The patient completed her course of Levofloxacin antibiotics.
The patient did have periodic episodes of mild fleeting chest
pressure and a urinary tract infection also for which she was
on antibiotics.  The CT scan showed some evidence of
emphysema with a question of bronchiectasis.  White blood
cell count on [**12-18**] was still 15, but the plan was to
have the patient to undergo surgery on Thursday.  The patient
was also seen by the sleep disorder fellow.  On consult
please refer to the consult note.  On [**12-19**] the patient
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with
a left internal mammary coronary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, vein graft to the obtuse marginal
and a vein graft to the right coronary artery.  The patient
was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.

On postoperative day one the patient remained on Levofloxacin
and Vancomycin and was on an insulin drip at 2 units per hour
and a neo-synephrine drip at 1.0.  Blood pressure was 103/49.
The patient was in sinus rhythm, slightly tachycardic at 99
with a cardiac index of 2.0.  The patient had been extubated
and was saturating 97% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
Postoperatively on day one the white blood cell count rose to
29, hematocrit remained at 26.8 and creatinine was 1.3.  The
patient's was alert and oriented times three.  Heart was
regular rate and rhythm.  The patient had rhonchi
bilaterally.  The examination was otherwise unremarkable.  A
repeat chest x-ray was obtained.  The patient was weaned of
neo during the day and remained on an insulin drip.  Lasix
diuresis was begun.  Plavix was started in addition to the
aspirin and the patient was started back on beta blockade
with Metoprolol at 25 mg po b.i.d.  The patient was seen by
physical therapy for evaluation.  On postoperative day two
the patient was transferred out to the floor with a blood
pressure of 130/80, respiratory rate 20, sating 96% on 4
liters nasal cannula.  The patient did have an episode of
tachycardia at 140 and was given Lopressor for beta blockade
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54094**].  The patient remained on bed rest at that
time pending resolution of tachycardia.  The patient went
into atrial fibrillation at 2:42 on [**12-22**].  Foley was
discontinued.

On postoperative day four lungs were clear bilaterally,
incisions were clean, dry and intact.  Heart was regular rate
and rhythm.  Back in sinus rhythm at 86 with periodic atrial
fibrillation.  White blood cell count was 23.4, hematocrit
23.8 and creatinine of 1.4.  The patient had been started on
oral Amiodarone after an Amiodarone drip to treat the atrial
fibrillation.  Chest tubes were discontinued.  Diet was
advanced.  The patient was out of bed and ambulating with the
nurses and physical therapists.  The patient was transfused 2
units of packed red blood cells on postoperative day four the
hematocrit dropped to 4.0 later in the day.  The patient
continued to be monitored to maintain a sinus rhythm.  The
patient was also followed by the pulmonary consult team,
which had consulted preoperatively.  On postoperative day
five the patient had completed two units of packed red blood
cell transfusion for a blood loss anemia and the patient
continued to ambulate and was doing well.  The plan was that
the patient could go home with physical therapy and
antibiotics continued for coverage of the preoperative
pneumonia and urinary tract infections.  On postoperative day
six the patient had no complaints and no events overnight.
The patient remained in sinus rhythm in the 80s with a blood
pressure of 140/70, satting well, 97% on room air.  Lungs
were clear.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.  The patient
did have 1+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.
Abdominal examination was benign.  Creatinine dropped to 0.9.
White blood cell count dropped to 18.4 and hematocrit rose
slowly post transfusion to 29.5.  The patient continued with
diuresis and plans were made to discharge the patient home to
the services of VNA.

On postoperative day seven the patient had gone back into
atrial fibrillation overnight, so discharge was delayed for
another 24 hours, but in the morning on the 11th the patient
was back in sinus rhythm at 75 with a good blood pressure a
