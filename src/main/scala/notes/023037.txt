Echo [**2147-6-27**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Doppler parameters are
most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Renal US [**2147-6-29**]: No evidence for renal artery stenosis.
Incidental note is made of a simple cyst in the left kidney.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: 55yo F with Hx of HTN and DM who experienced acute
shortness of breath, likely a result of pulmonary edema [**1-24**]
hypertensive urgency.
.
# SOB/dialstolic CHF: Presentation and CXR are indicative of
flash pulmonary edema in the setting of uncontrolled
hypertension. Pt is on a relatively large dose of clonidine, so
if missed a dose experienced rebound HTN. Labetolol drips and
nitro drips were started in the ED. Pt was placed on BiPAP in
the ED, and was able to be taken off of it easily upon arrival
to the CCU. In the CCU, she responded briskly to Lasix. Her LOS
fluid balance was -7.6L. Per patient, she did not carry a Dx of
CHF. Echo showed grade II LV disastolic dysfunction. Cardiac
enzymes were negative.
.
# HTN: Pressures well-controlled on nitro gtt. The goal
antihypertensive regimen for this patient was long-acting meds
to avoid rebound with missed doses. After trail and error, the
pt's SBP was stable in the 110s-120s on metoprolol succinate
300mg daily, lisinopril 40mg daily, and amlodipine 10mg daily.
HCTZ 25mg daily was added as this pt appears to have very
salt-responsive HTN. According to previous PMD's office, pt had
not had a workup for secondary causes of HTN. TSH/T4 were
normal. Renal US showed no evidence of renal vascular disease.
24 hour urine for metanephrines and cortisol as well as serum
renin and aldosterone were sent out to look for any other
endocrinse causes of HTN. Pt is going to establish a new PMD
here at [**Hospital1 **] who can f/u on these labs when the results are
available.
.
# Type II DM: Home metforim was continued.
.
# Methadone maintenance: Home dose of 80mg was continued after
it was verified with her counselor. She recieves her methadone
d/c to take to her clinic.
.
# Depression: Home doses of sertraline and amitryptline
continued. Social work consulted to talk to patient re:
stressors at home.
.
# gastritis: Home pantoprozole continued.
