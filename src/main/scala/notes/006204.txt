EKG: NSR at 90, LAD, NI, Jpoint elevation V2-V3, no acute STTW
changes, unchanged from prior

CXR: Linear atelectasis and R costophrenic angle. No edema.
Prominance of right hilum likely related to kyphoscoliosis. No
acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**10-3**]:
Limited study secondary to motion artifact. No e/o acute
intracranial
abnormality. Right maxillary sinus disease. Chronic small vessel
ischemic disease. Meningiomas not well seen. Evidence of prior
dens fracture. Consider MRI if clinical concern for stroke.


Brief Hospital Course:
88-year-old man with history significant for dementia, blindness
and hard of hearing, failure to thrive with weight loss, ESRD on
hemodialysis admitted for altered mental status.
.
# AMS: Patient noted to be more somnolent on admission in the
ICU. Within time his mental status improved to his baseline. A
Utox/serum was negative for benzodiazepines, but its utility for
Ativan is controversial. Another possibility is poor tolerance
to dialysis. The patient was noted to have a change in mental
status after dialysis. Infections and metabolic abnormalities
have been ruled out on this hospital admission. The UA was WNL,
CXR unchanged. CT head negative for acute ischemic etiology. CXR
unchanged from prior. Blood glucose within normal limits. D
.
ESRD on hemodialysis: The patient receives dialysis on Tuesdays,
thursdays and Fridays. He has received dialysis while in-house
and tolerated it well. He appears clinically dry, so very little
fluid was removed on these sessions. There is some concern that
his outpatient dialysis has been removing too much fluid. These
concerns will be addressed with his outpatient dialysis by the
renal fellow.
.
Hypertension: The patient remained hypertensive and asymtomatic
from it while in the hospital. He has been ranging 140-160s on
the day of discharge. He was started on Captorpil on this
admission and it showed be uptitrated as an outpatient. He has
had hypertension in the past, but there was some concern that
during dialysis his BP would drop too low, however, during his
dialysis sessions while in the hospital, he was never
hypotensive.
.
Pancytopenia: The patient has a macrocytic anemia and
thrombocytopenia. These have been attributed to MDS in the past.
B12, folate levels have been normal. He was supposed to have
outpatient followup with hematology based on a past D/C summary,
but it does not remain clear that he had that evaluation.
.
Monocytosis: The pateint presented with a WBC=4.7 with 14%
monocytes. He has had a similar monocytosis in the past. The
significance of this monocytosis remains unclear in the acute
illness setting.
.
High TSH: The patient had a high TSH in the hospital setting.
TSH=4.4, seems to have been trending upwards. The patient will
need outpatient followup with his PCP for the significance of
this high TSH.
