Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, lower-extremity edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Attempt at paracentesis, unsuccessful


History of Present Illness:
This is a 41 year-old female with a history of combined
immunodeficiency syndrome, hepatitis C, brittle type 1 diabetes,
and cirrhosis, past cholecystectomy and appendectomy, who
presents with increasing abdominal girth, progressive abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, and increasing lower extremity oedema.
She was recently discharged from [**Hospital6 204**] 3 days
PTA where she was reportedly admitted for DKA, and also had
episode of coffee ground emesis requiring blood transfusion.
She reports also experiencing fever to 100.5 while in the
hospital.  Per patient, she was also noted to have elevated
ammonia level at OSH.  She does not recall and endoscopy being
performed, although she says she was "out of it".  Patient
reports she has had a 14 pound weight gain from 121 to 134 lbs
over past several weeks, despite a progressive weight loss from
170 lbs. since [**2187-12-25**].  She reports diffuse abdominal pain
that had been intermittent since discharge, but progressed to
constant and severe over past 2 days.
.
She was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic today for follow-up and referred for
direct admission due to severity of her symptoms.  She denies
hematemesis or coffee ground emesis today (reports emesis as
being green/brown).  Last ate this morning.  She denies
diarrhea, although she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 359**] with
diarrhea and found to have cryptosporidium at that time.  No
melena or hematochezia.  She reports being adherent to her
medications.  Her main concern is the progressive lower
extremity oedema.  She has not been on loop diuretics in the
past because of a sulfa-allergy.
.
ROS: No cough, shortness of breath or respiratory symptoms.  No
chest pain

Past Medical History:
1)Type 1 Diabetes, difficult to control, she has frequent
admissions for AMS from hypoglycemia. Followed at [**Last Name (un) **].

inflammation with focal bridging (Grade 3).
2. Marked bile duct proliferation with neutrophils (see note)
3. Trichrome stain: Moderate increase of portal and septal
fibrosis (Stage 2).
7) cryptosporidium, as above
8) ? inflammatory bowel disease (UC)--per patient, last flare
many years ago, not on any treatment

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2188-11-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Ascites.
2. Extensive lobulated and irregular contours of the kidneys,
likely scarring
from chronic reflux, unchanged.
3. Dependent atelectasis at the lung bases.
4. Small amount of air in the subcutaneous tissue on the right,
might be from recent procedure or subcutaneous injection. Please
correlate
U/S- abdomen [**2188-11-7**] (was ordered to guide paracentesis):
IMPRESSION: No ascites. The paracentesis was not performed.

B/L LENIs [**2188-11-7**]:
IMPRESSION: No lower extremity DVT identified. Please note, the
left distal superficial femoral vein could not be evaluated
given overlying edema
.
ECHO [**2188-11-10**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CT head [**2188-11-11**]: IMPRESSION
1. No evidence for acute infarction or hemorrhage.

KUB [**2188-11-11**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive retained fecal material throughout the colon.
2. Question of mucosal fold thickening in a mildly dilated
air-filled loop of bowel in the left upper quadrant. This could
represent ischemia in the
splenic flexure, and close radiographic followup is recommended.


KUB [**2188-11-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Increasing distention of colonic loops compared to
[**2188-11-12**]. No free air identified.

pCXR [**2188-11-13**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of free intraperitoneal
air.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2188-11-13**]:
MPRESSION:
1. Right rectus muscle hematoma, within the right lower
quadrant, may explain patient's symptoms.
2. Moderate distention of colon with fecal residue seen
throughout the colon, and unusual locules of air on the
dependent surface of the colon. While this likely reflects
trapped air within fecal matter, close observation for
development of ischemic symptoms is recommended. However, there
is no direct evidence for ischemia on this study.
3. Ascites, with anasarca.
4. Dependent atelectases in the visualized lung bases.
5. Extensive lobulated irregular contours of the kidneys, likely
reflecting scarring, stable.

KUB [**11-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Moderate gaseous distention of colonic loops,
slightly improved from [**2188-11-12**].

KUB [**11-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Continued moderate gaseous distention of the colon
without
dilated small bowel loops. Findings are consistent with colonic
ileus.

KUB [**11-15**]:
ABDOMEN, SUPINE: The distention within the colon seen on the
prior film has resolved. Appearances are consistent with
resolving ileus.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 41 year-old female with multiple medical problems who
presents with abdominal pain and distention, and increasing
lower extremity edema.

# Abdominal pain - Initially, the etiology of abdominal pain was
unclear.  The patient is on narcotics as an outpatient for
chronic pain.  SBP was on differential, given distention, exam
consistent with ascites, and
