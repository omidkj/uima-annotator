BLOOD Cultures ([**4-22**]):  4/4 bottles beta strep group A


Brief Hospital Course:
1) SEPSIS:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Never required pressors as BP
responded to fluids.  Started on vanco, ceftriaxone, and
levaquin.  Initially, there was no clear source of infection.
She had a painful erythematous toe on right foot.  Admission
blood cultures grew out group A strep in high grade.  Her
antibiotics were narrowed to Ctx only.  ID was consulted.  It
was felt that the toe was the likely source of infection.
Surveillance blood cultures were clear except for [**12-1**] CNS on
[**4-22**] that was a likely contaminant.  Pt's fevers and
leukocytosis resolved with antibiotics.  She will complete a 4
week course of Ctx and f/u with ID.
.
2) Septic Arthritis/Cellulitis:
Rheumatology was consulted regarding the 2nd digit on her right
foot.  An athrocentesis was done with scant fluid which was
negative on culture.  However, it was felt that the pt may have
had a septic arthritis there so pt's abx course was plannned for
4 weeks.  The joint was small and there was no fluid there so a
surgical washout was not necessary.
.
3) R.A:
Per rheum, leflunomide was stopped and prednisone was continued.
.
4) CAD/HTN:
Initially, her BP meds were held due to sepsis.  After she was
on the floor, her BP rose and her meds were restarted.  On
discharge, she is to resume all her pervious cardiac meds.
