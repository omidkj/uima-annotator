Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a past medical history of
CAD (s/p BMS x 2 [**6-3**]), chronic systolic HF, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **],
and CRI (baseline Cr~2.0), and recent inguinal hernia repair who
presents with coplaints of chest pain.  The patient underwent a
cardiac cath [**2143-6-3**] after an abnormal stress test, showing 2VD.
He had BMS x 2 place to his D1 and OM1.  His course had been
complicated by the development of a right groin hematoma, s/p
evacuation, and 3-cm femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, which was
treated by IR.  The patient had developed increasing right
inguinal groin pain, and was found to have an inguinal hernia.
He underwent an open inguinal hernia repair on [**10-15**].

On the day prior to presentation, the patient was feeling
increasing fatigue and mild dynpea on exersion.  As the day
progressed began to feel chilled and had rigors.  He was unable
to sleep that night, experiencying orthopnea, and increasing
dysnpea.  He reports that the feeling of SOB was similar to a
prior CHF exacerbation.  He also began to experience mild chest
tightness, which persisted for hours, even upon arrival to the
ED.
.
He denies any recent infecious symptoms.  No sinus pain, cough,
abdominal discomfort, diahrea, dysuria.  He has not noted any
erythema or increasing tendernss of right groin surgical site.
He has noted a slight increase in ankle swelling, but no pain
with passive movement.
  .
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,  myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
.
In the ED, vitals were 101.2 145/69 130 99%on 3L. EKG showed
sinus tach with STD in V3-V6. CXR showed ?CHF. He was given asa,
nitro, plavix, and heparin. Became hypotensive to 90's with
nitro and morphine. No BB was given secondary to CHF. He was
additionally given 40mg IV lasix, and put out 1L.  He has been
seen by gen surgery in ED, was seen at [**Location (un) 620**] ED by vascular
per ED report they are ok with anticoag.  They felt that there
was no clinical suspicion of right groin infection.   Had fever
to 101 got vanc and zosyn for PNA, and admitted to the CCU for
further manegment.

Blood cultures [**2143-10-27**]: No growth to date
Urine Cultures [**2143-10-27**]: No growth to date
.
Chest X-ray [**2143-10-27**]: Mild interstitial edema. No evidence of
pneumonia.
.
ECG [**2143-10-27**]: Sinus tachycardia w/ APCs @ 110, 1mm ST
depressions in v3-v5, TWI v1-v2 (unchanged.)  Left anterior
fasicular block, LVH
.
Pelvic CT [**2143-10-27**]:
1. Mixed-density moderate-sized collection within the right
inguinal canal, consistent with postoperative hematoma. No
regions of air locules are present within this collection to
suggest superinfection. Right scrotal hydrocele.
2. More discrete air-containing collection is noted superiorly
adjacent to
the surgical mesh. This is presumably related to adjacent
bioabsorbable plug which was placed per operative report. Focal
abscess thought to be less likely.
3. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute
diverticulitis.
.
Femoral Artery Ultrasound [**2143-10-27**]: Large right groin hematoma.
No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
.
Transthoracic Echo [**2143-10-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by
transesophageal echocardiography). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.
.
V/Q Scan [**2143-10-28**]: Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary
embolism.
.
Persantine Mibi [**2143-10-28**]: Predominantly fixed distal anterior
wall and apical defect. 2. Markedly dilated left ventricular
cavity. 3. Global hypokinesis and apical akin
