GI BX
Stomach, antrum, mucosal biopsy:
1.  Chronic, focally active gastritis.
2.  Special stain for H. pylori will be reported as addendum.



Imaging:
ECG
Sinus rhythm. There is an RSR' pattern in lead V1 which is
probably normal. Early repolarization. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

EGD:

Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
            Ulcer in the antrum (biopsy, thermal therapy)
            Blood in the whole stomach
            Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with
duodenitis
            Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations:  follow-up biopsy results please continue PPI
IV Bid, and please check H. pylori Antibodies status. pt should
repeat EGD in 6 weeks
follow-up with endoscopist within 6 weeks


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1538**] is a 31 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for asthma admitted to the MICU for hypotension and GI bleed.
.
# Gastrointestinal bleed with acute blood loss anemia: The
patient presented to ED with hematemesis and a nasogastric
lavage produced coffee ground material. The patient was started
on a PPI drip and admitted to the MICU.  GI was consulted and
conducted an EGD. The EGD required intubation and showed a large
antral ulcer with a clot formed on it. The patient was extubated
without issues. A biopsy was taken that showed chronic focally
active gastritis. Special stain for H. pylori was pending at
time of discharge. The H. pylori antibody blood test was
negative. He was followed with serial hcts and remained stable
for 24 hours prior to admission. His discharge Hct was 29.5. GI
would like the patient to receive an additional EGD in 6 wks in
the outpatient setting for futher biopsy. He will be maintained
on high dose pantoprazole 40 mg twice a day and see GI within 6
weeks.
.
# Leukocytosis: At time of admission, WBC 19.7 with left shift
found, likely reactive in setting of GI bleed.  Good oxygenation
through hospital stay making aspiration less likely. WBC trended
down on own to 7.6 near time of discharge.
.
# Asthma: Stable, although poorly controlled. Continued on
albuterol MDI and nebs as needed during hospitalization.
