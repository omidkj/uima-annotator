Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain; aphasia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] is an 83 year-old man with a past medical history of
coronary artery disease and multiple recent admissions,
presenting with aphasia.
.
Of note, multiple recent admissions --
1. [**2137-2-21**] - [**2137-3-5**]: Admitted with a large STEMI (occluded
LAD, RCA, 90% circumflex. His course was complicated by LAD
in-stent thrombosis, vfib/vtach, cardiogenic shock, and right
sided femoral to popliteal DVT.
2. [**2137-3-13**] - [**2137-3-20**]: Admitted with chest pain and CHF.
3. [**2137-5-5**] - [**2137-6-3**]: Admitted with acute CHF. Course
complicated by cholecystitis. A percutaneous cholecystostomy
tube was placed, and he was treated with daptomycin, then
linezolid (after ARF) for VRE. He then underwent ERCP with
placement of stent in ampulla for stone in CBD. Of note, during
this admission, his blood pressures were consistently in the 80s
to 90s systolic.
.
On the morning of admission, patient awoke at 6am with
right-sided chest pain with mild shortness of breath. He was
given Maalox and SL nitro, the combination of which resolved his
pain. He was also noted at this time to have a systolic blood
pressure in the 80s, although this is his baseline. The patient
reports that approximately an hour later, when the physician
came to see him, he was initially "just out of it." After saying
something to the physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was then unable to talk. This
period of aphasia lasted ~10 minutes and was not associated with
weakness or apparent sensory deficits. He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the emergency room, initial vitals showed a HR of 68, BP
72/39, RR 18 and 94% on 2 liters. His blood pressure trended in
the 80-90s systolic. He received 1.5 of IVF and potassium
repletion


Past Medical History:
# Myocardial Infarction [**1-/2137**], s/p cath with PTCA and 2 stents
placed in proximal LAD. C/b cardiogenic shock and VT requiring
defibrillation/pacing for heart block
# Myocardial Infarction with two stents placed in the RCA in
[**2127**].
# RLE DVT [**3-1**]
# Diabetes: HA1c 6.4% on [**11-30**]. High grade proteinuria X 1 yr.
# Hypertension
# Hypercholesteremia
# Asthma
# Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease (baseline creatinine 2.5 to
2.8)

Social History:
Social history is significant for a long standing history of
smoking prior to his myocardial infarction.  He is now residing
at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and is not currently smoking.  He does not use
alcohol.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:
VITALS - T 98.2, HR 84, BP 95/45, 94% on 2 liters NC.
GEN - Elderly appearing male, lying
HEENT - No carotid bruits bilaterally.
CV - Regular. No murmurs. No S3/S4.
PULM - Bibasilar crackles. No wheezes.
ABD - Soft. Chole tube in place. Mild tenderness in RLQ, below
tube. No rebound/guarding. No tenderness otherwise.
EXT - Warm. Very thin extremities.
NEURO - Pupils are irregular and surgical. EOMI with mild
nystagmus on lateral movement. Otherwise normal cranial nerves.
Mildly diminished muscle bulk diffusely. Strength 5/5 in upper
and lower extremeties bilaterally. Sensation intact to light
touch throughout.

IMAGING
-------

[**6-7**] CT head: No hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect. Chronic
small vessel ischemic disease. Age-related parenchymal atrophy.

[**6-8**] MRI/MRA: No acute infarcts. Minimal amount of chronic
microangiopathic change and moderate degree of atrophy. Possible
irregularity of the basilar artery which may be artifactual due
to patient motion versus atherosclerotic disease. Limited
T2-weighted images of the head were obtained as the patient was
not able to tolerate the exam. There are scattered white matter
T2 hyperintensities, which likely represent
chronic microangiopathic change. There is generalized moderate
atrophy. The visualized major flow voids are grossly normal.

[**6-8**] Gallbladder US: Cholelithiasis, with a cholecystostomy tube
in place.  Relatively decompressed gallbladder compared to [**5-21**], [**2136**] with mild
improvement in wall thickening.

[**6-8**] echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. A left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest c/w a small
secundum atrial septal defect/stretched [**Doctor Last Name **] ovale. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated with severe regional systolic
dysfunction and apical aneurysm. The basal inferolateral wall
contracts best. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
hypokinesis of the distal free wall. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2137-3-22**], the left ventricular cavity is now
larger with more severe systolic dysfunction. A small secundum
type atrial septal defect is now identified. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.

[**6-10**] Abdominal CT: 1. No acute abnormality is seen. 2.
Questionable thickening of the distal sigmoid colon which likely
reflects the patient's known Clostridium difficile colitis. 3.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm. 4. Biliary stent and percutaneous
cholecystostomy tube identified. 5. Large bilateral pleural
effusions are seen.

[**6-10**] Carotid US: Left 60-69%, right <40%.


Brief Hospital Course:
83M with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus presenting with chest
pain and aphasia.

Aphasia:
Seen by the stroke service in the emergency room.  Symptoms
possibly related to left hemisphere event, most probably in the
MCA distribution.  Unclear what role hypotension plays given
that this has been a persistent problem; no watershed infarct
seen.  Pt now fully communicative. Neuro believes it could have
been a TIA.  MRI/MRA suboptimal as he moved; carotid US with
left side stenosis of 60-69% but likely symptomatic as he is
hypotensive at baseline (SBP 80-90).  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from Cardiology
evaluated patient on [**6-12**], felt that maximizing CHF treatment
and anti-coagulation would be the best course at this time
unless patient were to develop additional neurologic symptoms,
as potential difficulties with hypotension and bradycardia would
be concerning in this patient if he were to get a carotid stent.
 He was continued on coumadin, aspirin and plavix.  The INR was
3.3 on discharge and [**Hospital
