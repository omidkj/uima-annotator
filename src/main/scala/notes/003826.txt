CTA:
FINDINGS: Again, a hypodense nodule in the left lobe of the
thyroid is seen measuring 15 x 13 mm, similar in appearance to
prior study.

The aorta shows no evidence of dissection or intramural
hematoma.

Extensive filling defects are seen within the pulmonary arterial
tree involving both right and left branches and nearly all
pulmonary lobes and segments. There is relative sparing of the
left upper lobe. There is enlargement of the right ventricle
with leftward bowing of the interventricular septum, concerning
for right heart strain.

The lungs are clear aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis. There
is no pleural or pericardial effusion. Calcified atherosclerotic
disease in the coronary arteries bilaterally.

The visualized portion of the upper abdomen appears
unremarkable.

The bones demonstrate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine
but no aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Massive pulmonary emboli with CT signs of right heart strain.
These
findings were communicated to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 18:45 on
[**2120-8-12**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11623**] over the phone.
2. Left thyroid nodule - nonemergent ultrasound may be
considered if
clinically indicated.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with chronic kidney disease, dementia, HTN and recent
admission for rising BUN and reduction in hematocrit admitted
with hypoxia and found to have large bilateral pulmonary emboli
.
#Acute pulmonary embolism: CTA showed massive pulmonary embolus
with evidence of right heart strain. She also had a troponin
leak (peak 0.22), as well as an elevated BNP.  In addition, she
was also hypoxic on presentation, and the patient was admitted
to the MICU.  She was started on a heparin drip. Her Hct were
monitored and stable. Based on her impaired renal function, she
was not candidate for lovenox and she was transitioned to
coumadin via heparin drip. On transition to the floor, the
patient was satting mid-90s on 2L NC.  She was therapeutic on
her coumadin with INR peaking at 3.8 and heparin drip was
discontinued after two days of therapeutic INR.  Coumadin was
held when INR > 3 with instructions for her to restart coumadin
when INR <3.  She was weaned down on her oxygen to 1-2 L by time
of discharge with instructions to increase nasal cannula if
oxygen levels fall below 92%.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr on admission was 1.6. She
improved with IVF last admission. She was given gentle hydration
creatinine improved. On transition to the floor, her creat has
stablized, on discharge it is 1.0.
.
#Anemia: Stable on last admission at which point this was felt
to be anemia of chronic inflammation. During hospitalization,
patient had no signs or symptoms of occult bleed and was guiac
negative. Her HCT remained stable in the high 20s and upon
discharge her Hct was 31.0.  Iron studies were consistent with
anemia of chronic inflammation.
.
#Dementia: Patient has dementia at baseline, oriented to person.
Rapidly deteriorating course per family and documentation.  She
was continued on home haldol for agitation - QTc noted to be
prolonged at baseline (peaking in the 490s) and rechecked during
stay
