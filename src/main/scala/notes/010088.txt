Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
Bone/ thigh pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunneled line removal [**11-9**]
PICC line placement [**11-11**]
PICC removal [**11-19**]
Bone marrow biopsy [**11-19**]

History of Present Illness:
64-year-old man 51 days after a matched unrelated donor,
non-myeloablative transplant for AML, after a history of
polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] with myeloid metaplasia and myelofibrosis and
previous splenectomy. Patient presents after a morning episode
where he developed gradual throbbing/ pulsating in his right
thigh when he was walking. He rates the pain [**3-28**] with walking
and improved with putting his feet up. He has never had this
sort of episode in the past. Patient also endorses a single
temperature f 99 and a brief episode of sweats, but no chest
pain or shortness of breath, after walking around during this
time. He sat down and noted that his stomach was queasy. He
endorses a chronic runny nose, but otherwise has been
asymptomatic with no localizing symptoms including no fevers,
chills, neck stiffness, cough, dysuria, diarrhea.

Of note, patient was recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] in clinic
[**2196-10-27**] and had a CT torso with contrast. That evening, he
developed a single fever of 100.3, called in, but was told to
wait it out.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
Longstanding history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] with myeloid
metaplasia s/p splenectomy [**2188**], previously treated with
hydroxyurea and splenectomy. He was diagnosed with acute
myelogenous leukemia on the [**2196-6-6**], negative for NPM
mutation and for the FLT 3 mutation, treated with induction
chemotherapy of idarubicin and Ara-C, but had persistent disease
and was therefore reinduced with mitoxantrone, etoposide and
Ara-C on the [**2196-6-1**]. His hospital course was complicated by
febrile neutropenia, E. coli and VRE bacteremia, a questionable
fungal pneumonia. He had a drug rash to cefepime. He developed
A-Fib with rapid ventricular response that was treated and
resolved. He had significant edema and hypoxia, which at one
point required an ICU admission. He recovered from those, was
discharged from the hospital on [**2196-7-26**] to complete a course
of IV meropenem and daptomycin for his E. coli and VRE
bacteremia. A followup bone marrow showed him to have persistent
fibrosis, but no evidence of leukemia. He did not have a sibling
donor, but a [**5-24**] matched unrelated donor was identified and the
patient has agreed to participate in protocol 07-384, reduced
intensity conditioning for an allo hematopoietic stem cell
transplant using clofarabine, total lymphoid radiation and ATG.
