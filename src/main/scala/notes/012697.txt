Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]

[**2172-4-2**]


History of Present Illness:
86 year old woman with AF on coumadin (INR 2.2 today),
pacemaker, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiomyopathy, normal
coronaries by cath in [**2170-4-15**], presents with generalized
weakness x 2 weeks. Seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10543**] on [**3-23**] for weakness -
reports intermittent weak spells that last 1-2 days, no syncope
or palpitations. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-23**] and found to
have a new dilated cardiomyopathy, EF 35% 2 weeks prior to
admission. TTE showed thickened aortic valve without stenosis,
trace AI, mildly thicekened mitral valve leaflets, mildly
calcified mitral annulus, severe MR, normal RV, LAE, [**Last Name (un) **],
diffuse hypokines of LV, severe pulmonary HTN. MR was thought to
be [**3-18**] dilated cardiomyopathy and likely not ischemic. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
.
Additionally, pt was treated for UTI with levaquin (day 5 at
time of transfer). She was started on B12 1000mcg IM daily for 1
week, with instructions to transition to weekly for a month and
monthly afterwards. Coumadin was held and vitamin K was given
for supratherapeutic INR of 3.1.
.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], pt had TEE done which showed EF 40-45%,
P>A MVP and 3+ anterior MR, with mild global LV hypokinesis.
Cath was not done at this time given INR 2.2 and severe MR.
.
Vitals on transfer were 135/65, 83 AF with occasional paced
beats, 20, afebrile, 97% on room air.

ECHO [**3-27**]: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%). There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate/severe posterior leaflet (P2)
mitral valve prolapse with mild anterior leaflet prolapse. An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be underestimated (Coanda
effect). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened with
mild prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Posterior (P2 scallop) > anterior mitral valve
prolapse with moderate to severe, anteriorly directed, mitral
regurgitation. Mild tricuspid valve prolapse with mild tricuspid
regurgitation. Mild global LV hypokinesis.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
A patent foramen ovale is present. It represents flow from the
regurgitant mitral jet which is anteriorly-directed and opening
the flap.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 - 35 %). with mild global free wall
hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on epinephrine infusion.
There is a well-seated mitral ring prosthesis with a mean
gradient of 3 and area of 2.2. There is no MR and no leak around
the ring.
Biventricular systolic fxn is mildly improved with EF 35 - 40%.
There is no flow through the PFO even though it was not
surgically repaired.
1+ AI. Aorta intact.
