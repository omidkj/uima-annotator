History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 yo female with a past medical history of COPD,
HTN, CHF who p/w resp distress from home. She was discharged
yesterday from the hospital during which she was treated for
hypertensive urgency in the setting of dyspnea and anxiety. She
responded promptly to SL nitroglycerin and BiPap and experienced
no further dyspnea and was discharged to home on [**6-8**]. Her
medications were adjusted during this admission to continue
nifedipine, but to exchange diltiazem for verapamil, and per the
patient's daughter, she obtained several doses of verapamil
until she could fill the new prescriptions (she was NOT sent
home with these doses, which was confirmed with the [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2
nursing staff). The patient arrived home from the hospital after
6pm and received 3 medications she had at home, it is unclear if
the diltiazem was one of these medications. She then became
acutely distressed today and called EMS. Upon EMS arrival, she
was found to be hypertensive to 200/40 and bradycardic. She was
intubated for resp distress in the field and was given atropine
for HR in 30s (unclear if for hypotension).
.
Upon reaching ED- SBP in 90s and she was satting well on the
vent. She was found to be in a new junctional rythm on EKG in
30's 40's. In the ED, she received glucagon, versed, levoflox,
solumedrol, calcium and received fluid for an elevated lactate.
A CXR revealed interstitial edema. [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] was consulted but did
not feel that her respiratory failure was CHF related. UA neg.
She received an additional dose of atropine for HR in the 20's
prior to transfer to the MICU. She is admitted to the MICU for
further work up and management.


Past Medical History:
1.   Asthma/COPD -  Recently admitted for a flare on [**2146-3-29**] and
treated with nebulizers, steroids, and a course of azithromycin.
 Last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1632**] in Pulmonology in [**Month (only) 547**], when he
thought she was deconditioned from her time in the hospital
although adequately medicated.  Recommended a Cardiology consult
at this time for what he believed to be significant diastolic
dysfunction secondary to long-standing hypertension.
2.   Paralyzed left hemidiaphragm s/p pericardial window
procedure
3.   Severe hypertension with diastolic dysfunction - Per PCP
notes typically controlled in the 160's unless patient
experiences an asthma flare when it shoots to 170's-180's.
Notably systolic pressures were in the 130's during her last
hospital admission, presumably the reason why her HCTZ and
enalapril doses were halved.  Patient is poorly compliant and
most recently has not been taking her antihypertensives due to
her ill son-in-law, unable to pick up her meds from the
pharmacy.
4.   Hyperlipidemia
5.   Chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine around 1.4).
6.   Polymyalgia rheumatica.
7.   Osteoporosis.
8.   Trigeminal neuralgia - reportedly seen by Optometry [**2146-4-26**]
and referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Last Name (STitle) 878**].
9.   Iron-deficient anemia
10.  Gastritis

Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] is a widow of many years and a mother of three. She
lives in the bottom unit of a shared home with her daughter and
son-in-law, who provide her with a large amount of care and
support. Although Ms. B is able to complete most of her ADL's,
she relies on her daughter for shopping and cooking. While she
doesn't specifically say it, her increasing dependence on her
children has taken a bit of its toll on her. This may be
partially responsible for her decreased med compliance - the
patient relies on others to go to CVS to pick up her meds. Her
daughter had the flu prior to Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**]' hospitalization, and
because of this, she was unable to pick up her medications on
time. Additionally, it sounds as if the patient doesn't leave
her house very often. She comments on how she doesn't like to
walk outside or to sit on her porch. Ms. [**Known lastname 12129**] would rather
watch television, socializing with friends infrequently.

Family History:
Diabetes mellitus in siblings and children. No bleeding or
clotting disorders. Mom with ?MI

[**6-9**] CXR: 1. Endotracheal tube malpositioned in the right
mainstem bronchus. The tube should be pulled back at least 2.5
cm for more optimal placement.
2. Interstitial edema and right basilar atelectasis.
3. Large ovoid mass at the left lung base obscuring the
diaphragm. Diagnostic considerations include a lung mass,
fluid-filled hiatal hernia or possible Bochdalek hernia. Further
evaluation with PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended
when the patient's condition allows.
.
EKG: Underlying rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation or slow
junctional bradycardia, although there appear to be at least two
sinus beats. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific lateral
ST-T wave changes could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Ventricular premature beat. Compared to tracing #2 atrial
fibrillation and ventricular premature beat are new.

[**2146-6-19**] CXR: Mild failure probably present, persistent elevation
of the left hemidiaphragm.
.
[**2146-6-21**] Video Swallow: No aspiration or penetration identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
83F with asthma, hypertension, and diastolic dysfunction who
presented with sudden onset shortness of breath at home hours
after discharge from hospital found to be in a junctional
bradycardia and hypertensive.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Secondary to acute exacerbation of
COPD/asthma as well as acute on chronic diastolic CHF.  The
patient was intubated in the field for respiratory distress. She
has a long history of COPD exacerbations and acute diastolic
heart failure associated with refractory hypertension. Chest
film upon admit showed mild interstitial edema, and an elevated
left hemidiaphragm, consistent with her history of
hemidiaphragmatic paralysis. Any insult to her respiratory
status is obviously not tolerated well, given this neuromuscular
deficit and underlying obstructive disease. The patient was
found to be bradycardic, hypertensive and in respiratory
distress, most likely because
