Chief Complaint:
Question of new thoracic aneurysm disection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 y/o gentleman with a history of a thoracic
aortic aneurysm and now with a questionable new dissection,
found
at [**Hospital3 **].  The current non-contrast CT of the chest is
consistent with a 5.3 cm thoracic aneurysm from the proximal
arch
to the level of the pulmonary veins and small focal aortic
dissection involving the mid to distal thoracic aorta at the
level of the left inferior pulmonary vein. The patient was
admitted to [**Hospital3 6592**] from his nursing home 24 hrs prior
for
possible hemoptysis and difficulty breathing.  The patient is
suffering from Alzheimer's disease and is a poor historian -
historical information is being relayed via his health care
proxy.  On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] via [**Location (un) 7622**] the patient denies
pain, however, received fentanyl, labetolol, and nipride
enroute.
The patient was bradycardic on transfer, yet hemodynamically
stable.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2172-6-17**] 1:32 PM
FINDINGS: Comparison made to [**2172-6-12**]. Enlarged
cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Mediastinal widening
is not significantly changed. Left basilar atelectasis not
significantly changed. Lungs otherwise clear.  Minimal bilateral
pleural effusions are stable. Surgical clips in the mediastinum
are again noted. There is no pneumothorax.

CTA PELVIS/Abd/Chest W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of [**2172-6-13**]
9:18 AM
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Coronary artery calcifications
are present along with aortic annular calcifications. Surgical
clips are seen within the anterior mediastinum. Otherwise, the
heart and pericardium are unremarkable, without pericardial
effusion. There are scattered mediastinal lymph nodes, which are
slightly prominent, measuring up to approximately 1.2 cm in
short axis along the right paratracheal station.

Bilateral pleural effusions are present, which are moderate in
size. There is associated opacification of the adjacent lung,
likely reflecting atelectasis. Additional patchy opacities in
the upper lobes bilaterally, may reflect additional areas of
atelectasis or, alternatively, this may reflect an infection or
inflammatory changes. Small thyroid nodules are evident.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, pancreas
and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There are numerous
gallstones, without evidence of cholecystitis. Within bilateral
kidneys are innumerable rounded hypodensities, which are
incompletely characterized, as some of these are not clearly a
simple cyst. The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable.

The stomach and small bowel are normal. There is diverticulosis
of the colon, without evidence of diverticulitis. There is no
free air or free fluid. Few scattered retroperitoneal lymph
nodes are seen, which are not pathologically enlarged by CT size
criteria.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Foley catheter is in the bladder.
Prostate and
rectum are unremarkable. Incidentally noted is a small right
inguinal hernia, containing a loop of small bowel, without
evidence of obstruction. There is no free air or free fluid.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is
identified.
There are multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar
spine.

AORTA: There has been prior ascending aortic surgical repair
with a graft
seen. There is aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic arch, which
measures
approximately 4.9 cm in maximal dimensions, with an additional
aneurysm
involving the descending thoracic aorta which measures 4.9 cm
transverse x 4.8 cm AP, and spans approximately of 5 cc in
craniocaudad dimensions. Immediately inferiorly, there is a
focal thoracic aortic dissection, in an infra- subclavian level,
which spans approximately 4 cm of the thoracic aorta in
craniocaudad dimensions. The intimal flap is located along the
medial aspect of the aorta.

Additional infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is evident,
measuring
approximately 4.0 cm AP x 4.3 cm transverse, with irregular
atheromatous
plaque seen throughout. This abdominal aortic aneurysm extends
into bilateral common iliacs, with the right common iliac artery
measuring up to 2.3 cm in maximum dimensions, and the left
measuring up to 2.0 cm. Extensive atherosclerotic plaque is seen
throughout the abdominal aorta as well as the takeoff of the
celiac, SMA, as well as renal arteries bilaterally.

There is thrombus of the right external iliac and right common
iliac arteries, without any contrast opacification identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Thoracic aortic aneurysms as detailed above, with a focal
dissection seen within the distal descending thoracic aorta,
which involves a short segment.
2. Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
3. Occlusion of the right external iliac artery and common
femoral artery.
4. Post-surgical changes of the ascending aorta seen.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2172-6-12**] 10:10 PM
The cardiomegaly is moderate to severe. The mediastinum is
widened that might be related to aortic dissection. Left basal
opacity is present that might represent area of atelectasis.
There is minimal bilateral pleural effusion. There is no
evidence of pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. Three
surgical clips are projecting over the anterior mediastinum,
related to prior aortic surgery.

CARDIOLOGY:
Portable [**Date Range **] (Complete) Done [**2172-6-17**] at 11:02:13
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic arch is not well seen. No dissection flap is seen (best
excluded by TEE or thoracic MR/CT). The aortic valve
