(EF 12%), Gout, TIAs x2, Empyema s/p Thoracotomy, s/p Right
Radical Nephrectomy w/ resection & primary repair of IVC on
[**2160-9-15**] for Renal Cell Carcinoma with IVC invasion. The patient
is being transferred from T-SICU given his cardiac history. He
had an uneventful recovery course thus far. Currently extubated,
off pressors, on Pivoicaine (epidural) and Toradol for pain
control. At this time, he denies SOB, CP, palpitations. He gets
episodes of sharp pain at incision site lasting a few seconds,
but otherwise his pain is under control. The patient also
complains of gout fare in his right knee and left foot. His
outpatient antihypertensives (Carvedilol, Lisinopril) and
Aspirin are being held. The patient received Kefzol x 3 doses,
which has been d/c'd. The patient is currently afebrile.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. Reports TIAs in [**2155**] and [**2157**].
All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2160-9-22**]):
Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.

RENAL PATHOLOGY ([**2160-9-15**]): Macroscopic extent of tumor:  Tumor
extension into major veins.

MICROSCOPIC

Histologic Type:
Conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma.

Histologic Grade:  G3:  Nuclei very irregular, approximately 20
microns;nucleoli large and prominent.

EXTENT OF INVASION

Primary Tumor:  pT3b:  Tumor grossly extends into the renal vein
or its segmental (muscle-containing) branches, or vena cava
below the diaphragm.
Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.

Lymph Nodes
    Number examined:  6.
    Number involved:  0.

Distant metastasis:  pMX:  Cannot be assessed.
Margins
    Margin(s) involved by invasive carcinoma:  Renal vein margin
only.
Adrenal gland:  Uninvolved by tumor.
Venous invasion:  Present.
Additional Pathologic Findings:  None identified.

ADDENDUM:
Additional sections (P-R) were submitted.
There is no definite invasion of the renal sinus or perinephric
fat.

ECHO ([**2160-9-15**]): The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with overall
left ventricular systolic function being severely depressed
(LVEF= [**11-6**] %). There is preservation of the basal rim of
myocardium. The mid to distal anterior, inferior, anterolateral
and inferolateral walls are severely hypokinetic. The mid to
distal infero and antero septal walls are dyskinetic. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

ECG ([**2160-9-15**]): Sinus rhythm. Left bundle branch block. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2160-9-5**] multiple abnormalities
persist without major change.

CXR ([**2160-9-15**]): The ET tube tip is 6.7 cm above the carina, just
at the level of the
clavicular head. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The
Swan-Ganz catheter
tip is at the right ventricle outflow tracts/main pulmonary
artery.

Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Free air below the right

hemidiaphragm is seen most likely related to recent nephrectomy
and should be closely followed. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.


CXR ([**2160-9-16**]): Persistent large volume of free air under the
diaphragm with bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.

CXR ([**2160-9-18**]): Right subdiaphragmatic air (pneumoperitoneum)
has decreased compared to [**2160-9-16**]. There is unchanged
mild cardiomegaly without evidence of CHF.

XRAY OF KNEE (AP, LAT, OBLIQUE, [**2160-9-20**]): T
