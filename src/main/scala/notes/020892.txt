Chief Complaint:
Right lower extremity pain/swelling, acute on chronic renal
failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular line
IVC filter
HD tunneled line catheter


History of Present Illness:
72M with a history of CVA, PVD, COPD, CKD admitted with RLE
pain/swelling and [**Last Name (un) **].  The patient saw his pcp two days ago,
noticed to have increased swelling of his legs, was started on
Bactrim and Keflex for ? cellulitis. He lives with his son and
was sent here for further eval for worsening RLE pain with
movement.
.
In the ED, the patient underwent LENIs and was found to have a
right popliteal DVT with adjacent collaterals and probable area
of recannulization suggest subacute/chronic nature.  He was
given 1 dose of vancomycin and a bolus of heparin (not
continued).  He was also found to have an elevated creatinine
from 4.8 to 5.6 and hyperkalemia from 5.9 to 6.2.  EKG showed
NSR without spiked T waves (not confirmed, EKG not sent to
floor).  Patient was given 15gm Kayexelate.  He was also given
1L IVF for ? prerenal physiology.  Of note patient has recently
seen a nephrologist at [**Hospital1 18**] for discussion of hemodialysis
initiation.  Patient has been referred for HD access.
.
On transfer to ICU, VS:  96.3  63  144/60 17 100%RA.  Patient
complains of pain in his right leg.  Pain exacerbated by
ambulation.  On admission, patient declines fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, CP, SOB, headaches, change in vision,
abdominal pain.  He has not urinated today.  At baseline, he
urinates small amounts 3-4 times daily.

clot is not excluded.

that there are two right brachial arteries, an anatomical

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo M with Stage IV CKD who presents with RLE edema and
erythema admitted to MICU for hyperkalemia and EKG changes.

#RLE erythema and edema -
Patient received LENIs in ED for RLE edema and erythema found to
have right popliteal DVT with recanulization and collaterals,
likely chronic. Patient received heparin bolus and placed on
heparin drip. Coumadin was not started because of the potential
for tunneled cath placement for HD initiation. He did receive 1
dose of Vanco in the ED, antibiotics not continued because
erythematous changes likely [**1-2**] DVT rather than infectious.  He
was continued on a heparin drip following transfer out of the
MICU to the medicine floor.  It was decided in conjunction with
the PCP that the patient was a poor long term anticoagulation
candidate given his multiple falls.  A removable IVC filter was
placed on [**2137-7-23**], and anticoagulation was stopped.  His RLE at
the time of discharge was stable and tender to palpation.
.
#Acute on Chronic Kidney disease, ESRD.
The patient was originally planned for vein graft in [**Month (only) 462**]
for initiation of dialysis.  The acute component of kidney
injury likely side effect of bactrim/keflex in addition to a
possible prerenal etiology. The patient underwent upper
extremity vein mapping, but it was decided not to place a
fistula during this hospitalization given his other acute
medical issues. Renal was consulted who initially wanted to
delay HD initiation, however it became clear that this was not a
possibility.  He underwent a HD tunneled line catheter placement
on [**2137-7-23**] and HD was initated on [**2137-7-24**].  He continued to get
HD throughout the remainder of his hospital course.  On [**8-6**] he
self d/c'd his HD catheter, and went to IR to place another also
on the R side but with a different tunnel.

#Hyperkalemia -
Due to acute on chronic kidney disease, he has had prior
hyperkalemic labs as an outpatient for which he received
Kayexalate. Patient received Kayexalate 15 g x 2, with
appropriate stooling and labs showed drop in K.  Patient had
evidence of ?peaked T waves on EKG in MICU, he received Ca-Gluc
and Kayexalate, potassium fell and he has been stable without
EKG changes.  On the floor, the patient continued to have
increased levels of potassium without EKG changes.  His labs
improved following dialysis.

#Anemia -
Required multiple transfusions at HD (last on [**8-5**] for HCT 18,
repeat 28). Normocytic anemia likely related to decreased
erythropoetin production in the setting of ESRD.  No evidence of
bleeding on exam.  Iron studies ordered revealed increased
levels of ferritin consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
His HCT stabilized in the upper 20s by the time of discharge.
He did not receive further PRBC transfusions.

#Diabetes -
Patient with chronic DM II on insulin. Was placed on ISS with
plan to restart long acting upon discharge.  He had a few
episodes of asymptomatic hypoglyc
