History of Present Illness:
HPI: [**Age over 90 **]M with PMH notable for CAD, CHF (EF 20-25%) was brought
to the ED this morning by his family with whom he lives. Prior
to this morning, the pt was at his baseline, and had taken a
number of day trips with his fmaily over the past 2 weeks.  This
morning, the pt's granddaughter went to his basement apt to look
in on him (his son and son's famly live upstairs) and found that
he was trembling and a bit confused. The pt's son then assessed
his father, and gave him Benadryl (1 tab) for the shaking. He
was sweating and clammy, but his temp later was >102 po The pt
then took his usual am meds with Glucerna, but vomited a frothy
emesis. He was then transported to the ED.
.
Per the pt's family, he had been feeling fine prior to this
morning. he had not complained of cough or SOB, nor had he
mentioned difficulty voiding or dysuria. His son empties a
bedside commode in the am for him, and has identified past UTIs
by malodorous urine, which he did not identify today. He had not
complained of CP or SOB. No GI sx, no bowel changes, no previous
fever/chills/malaise. He had not c/o HA or neck stiffness, or
pain of any kind. Pt had no recent exotic travel or known sick
contacts.
.
In the ED, the pt was initially stable but satting 84% RA. ON MD
exam, sat improved (?on NC), but temp was 104 with HR 60s, BP
134/61. He was minimally responsive (s/p benadryl) and exam was
notable for bibasilar rales. Because he was obtunded and had
ememis in ED with ?aspiration, he was intubated for airway
protection and quickly became hypotensive (BP min 105/50 prior
to sedation). He received 5L NS boluses (levophed started after
3L), as well as 2 g CTX, 1 gm vanc, 500 mg metronidazole, 1 g
tylenol, etomidate, succinylcholine, 10 mg dexamethasone, 2mg
midazolam x 2, levophed gtt, propofol gtt. He was subsequently
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further therapy and monitoring.

.
Echo [**10-19**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and  cavity size are normal. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the distal half of the ventricle. Basal segments are
hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15)
suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Aortic stenosis is not suggested. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**10-20**] Hip Film:
AP film of the pelvis plus two added views of the left hip and
proximal left femur. There is a bipolar left hip
hemiarthroplasty with cemented femoral stem. A poorly visualized
fracture of the proximal femoral shaft has been fixated by
apparent large osseous allografts with associated cerclage wires
and long lateral plate (with four screws below the tip of the
femoral stem). Overall appearances are unchanged from [**2128-10-8**] with no focal bone destruction or evidence of hardware
loosening. The right hip and SI joints are normal.
.
IMPRESSION: No short interval change. No radiographic evidence
infection or loosening.

[**10-22**] LLE U/S
UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT
Reason: please image left hip and thigh to rule out fluid
collection
.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with grp B strep bacteremia with history of left
hip fracture last year, hardware in place.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please image left hip and thigh to rule out fluid collection
INDICATION: Left leg swelling. Evaluate for deep venous
thrombosis.
.
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins were performed. There is normal flow,
augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms. Intraluminal
thrombus is not identified.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course, by Problem:
.
# Grp B strep septicemia: this was felt to be likely due to GU
source given active urinalysis, though urine cx negative.  A TTE
negative was negative for any vegetations adherent to the
patients valves or pacer wires.  The patients' family wished to
defer a TEE.  ID was consulted and recommended 4 weeks IV CTX as
well as
rechecking ESR/CRP in 2 weeks to see if rising.  Of note, a Left
hip plain film and LLE u/s to r/o fluid collection showed no
significant findings.  The longer course was recommended by ID
as the exact source of the bacteremia was unclear and
endocarditis was not fully ruled out.
.
#CVS
Ischemia:  the patient had several sets of CE during this
admission which were negative, despite lateral TWI on the
patients ECG.
Pump:  the patient was slightly overloaded after fluid
resusciation in the ICU.  He was diuresed and then restarted on
his home Lasix dose.  Of note, repeat Echo during this admission
showed an EF of 25% with (worsening) 2+ MR.  His amlodipine and
long-acting nitrate were discontinued during this
