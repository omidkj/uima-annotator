PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 66F w/ multiple medical problems including chronic
respiratory disease, multiple admissions for aspiration
pneumonia, brought in by EMS after her home health aide said she
"can't watch her like this". She has a PEG tube for feeding and
had been NPO for her chronic aspiration, but per her home health
aide her PCP has allowed her to try pudding by mouth which she
has been doing for about a month. Her aide thinks she may have
aspirated on Wednesday, as afterwards she started have some
shortness of breath and fever and has not been able to cough up
secretions. The patient initially refused to go the hospital but
her aide finally called EMS this am to bring her to the ED.

Per ED staff, she had decreased mental status and was unable to
provide any history. She was febrile to ~103 and had stable SBPs
in the 100s. She was covered with Vanc/Ceftaz/Clinda in the ED.
She appeared to be in respiratory distress, but the decision was
made not to intubate her in the ED due to medical futility. The
ED staff was only able to reach a sister in [**Name (NI) 19061**] who
states she was not her HCP and provided little other
information. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on humidified
facemask with O2 sats in the low 90s.

Pertinent Results:
CT ABDOMEN: There continued to be extensive nodular and
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right middle and lower lobes.
Dependent atelectasis and mild bronchiectasis are noted at the
right base. Overall, the appearance is improved compared to the
prior chest CT. [**Male First Name (un) **] low attenuation focus in liver is stable.
Small stones are noted in the gallbladder. The common bile duct
remains prominent, but stable. Again noted is an atrophic
pancreas with a somewhat prominent pancreatic duct. Patient is
status post splenectomy. The gastrojejunostomy tube appears in
good position. No associated fluid collections are identified.
The bowel loops are unremarkable. Small nonobstructing stone is
noted in the left kidney. The kidneys are otherwise
unremarkable. The adrenal glands are within normal limits. There
is no free air or free fluid. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy is identified.

CT PELVIS: The bladder, sigmoid colon, and rectum are
unremarkable. There is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy. Vascular calcifications are identified.

[**Male First Name (un) **] WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions. Left hip prosthesis, lumbar dextroscoliosis and
degenerative changes, and deformed right femur are stable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Well-positioned gastrojejunostomy tube without evidence of
abscess or free air.

2. Right middle and lower lobe tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] and nodular opacities
consistent with bronchiolitis. Overall, the appearance is
improved compared to [**2191-1-28**]. Likely due to chronic
aspiration or remote infection.

3. Cholelithiasis and stable prominence of the common duct.

4. Nonobstructing left ureteral calculus.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Reason: Please place GJ tube.
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
67 year old woman with hiatal hernia, recurrent aspiration, has
G tube. Would like GJ tube. Pt NPO since ~ 8 a.m.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please place GJ tube.
INDICATION: 67-year-old female with hiatal hernia and recurrent
aspiration with G-tube. Please place GJ tube.

RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18936**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3175**] performed the procedure.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3175**], the attending radiologist, was present and
supervising.

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and benefits were explained to
the patient and written informed consent was obtained. The
patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.
Lidocaine jelly and 10 cc of 1% lidocaine were applied at the
PEG site. Under fluoroscopic guidance, approximately 5 cc of
Optiray contrast were injected into the G-tube with free spill
of contrast into the stomach. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire was then advanced
under fluoroscopic guidance into the stomach. The existing PEG
tube was removed and an MP catheter was advanced into the
stomach. The MP catheter and [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire were used to navigate
into the duodenal loop and beyond the ligament of Treitz. An 18
French peel-away sheath was placed over the [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire into
the stomach. An 18 French MIC feeding jejunostomy tube was then
placed over the wire and the peel- away sheath removed. Under
fluoroscopic guidance, this was adva
