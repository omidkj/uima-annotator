He attempted to sleep propped up with pillows, but he continued
to wake up with dyspnea.  During this time he also noted DOE,

aVR.  Because of this he was sent to the ED.

but did show pulmonary edema. BNP was checked, and was found to
be elevated. 1 set of CE were sent, and were negative.

Studies:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2125-6-19**] 10:52 AM
The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or

vasculature are within normal limits. The osseous structures are
grossly unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA Chest [**2125-6-19**] Prelim read:
No PE, Bilateral ground glass opacities and fluffly alveolar
opacities, incorrelation with clinical features most consistent
with pulomnary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Dilated Cardiomyopathy:  Patient was admitted with new onset
PND and DOE.  He was found to have a dilated cardiomyopathy on
TTE with an ejection fraction of 20%.  SPEP and UPEP were
negative.  No evidence of thyroid dysfunction or
hemochromatosis.  The etiology was thought to be post viral.  He
symptomatically improved while in the hospital and he was
discharged on a low dose of beta-blocker and ACEI.  He may need
a cardiac MRI as an outpatient and should be followed with
serial echos.
.
#Rhythm - While in the hospital, the patient was noted to have a
wide complex tachycardia.  During the episode, he was given IV
metoprolol which cause his blood pressure to drop.  He was
transferred to the CCU because of a concern for unstable VT.
Further review of the EKGs with the EP service determined the
most likely etiology of his rhythm was actually a sinus
tachycardia with abarrancy.  His heart rate was controlled at
the time of discharge.  He will be followed by the EP service as
an outpatient.
