HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
female with a past medical history of chronic renal
insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin at home, who presents with 3 days of
dark red blood per rectum and episodes of lightheadedness.
She subsequently presented to the Emergency Department, where
she was found to have a hematocrit of 18.  A NG lavage was
negative for active bleeding.  She was sent to the ICU for
hemodynamic monitoring and transfusions and received 6 units
of red blood cells, vitamin K, 4 units of FFP and remained
hemodynamically stable.  Her INR slowly trended down and she
was awaiting a colonoscopy and EGD to find the source of
bleeding.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CHF.  History of diastolic dysfunction, echo from [**Month (only) 1096**]
   [**2184**] with an EF of 60 percent.
2. Type II diabetes mellitus.
3. Chronic renal failure, baseline creatinine 2.2 to 3.3.
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post pacer.
5. Hyperlipidemia.
6. Hypertension.
7. History of DVT.
8. Anemia.
9. Peripheral vascular disease, status post bypass.
10.      Colonic polyps.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone, single, no tobacco,
or alcohol.  She is supported by her sister who lives nearby.

ALLERGIES:  SULFA CAUSES HIVES.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Imdur 20 mg 3 times a day.
2. Hydralazine 30 mg 4 times a day.
3. Lopressor 50 mg twice a day.
4. Percocet p.r.n.
5. Lipitor 10 mg once a day.
6. Protonix 40 IV q.12.
7. Vitamin K.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature is 98.8,
blood pressure 138/60 to 160/74, heart rate 60 to 72,
respirations 20, O2 saturation 96 to 97 percent on room air,
and fingersticks 93 to 102.  General appearance:  The patient
appears comfortable in no apparent distress.  HEENT exam:
Nonicteric.  Mucosa moist.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and rhythm, 2/6
systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended with good bowel sounds, and obese.  Extremities:
No lower extremity edema.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  Notable for an initial hematocrit
of 18.2, which slowly trended up to the low 30s.  At the time
of transfer, her hematocrit was 30.3.  Her INR was initially
and 4.0 trended down to 1.5.  Creatinine was initially 3.3
and trended down to 2.7.  UA was negative.  Chest x-ray
showed cardiomegaly with stable improvement of CHF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. GI bleeding:  Her GI bleeding was felt to likely be
   related to her INR of 4 on Coumadin and was suspected that
   it was related to her previously known colonic polyps as a
   source of this bleeding.  Her Coumadin was held and her
   INR slowly drifted down and her hematocrit remained stable
   for the rest her hospital course.  She had a colonoscopy
   on [**2185-6-28**] showing rectal polyps, ascending colonic
   polyp, mid transverse polyp, which were all removed and
   she had a biopsy of the distal transverse colon.  She also
   had an EGD showing mild gastritis.  It was presumed that
   her bleeding was related to the colonic polyps and her
   Coumadin was held at the time of discharge.

1. Renal:  Her BUN and creatinine are slightly elevated at
   the time of admission, which improved to her baseline
   prior to admission.

1. Cardiac:  She did not have any episodes of congestive
   heart failure during this admission.  After discussion
   with the attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], instructed the patient
   they have considered discontinuing Coumadin therapy in the
   future because of the future risks of GI bleeding.

for discharge home.
