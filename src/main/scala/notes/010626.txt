Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4421**]
Chief Complaint:
Right arm and leg weakness following fall .

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cervical laminectomy

Tracheostomy
IVC filter placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 yo R-handed woman with metastatic
endometrial cancer to multiple sites, including the C-spine, who
presents with weakness in her R-arm and leg following a fall 3
days prior to presentation.

She presented with metastatic disease in [**Month (only) 216**] and underwent
XRT to the C-spine, along with a dexamethasone taper (now
finished). This was associated with excellent pain relief and
good neurologic function.  She was seen in oncology clinic
several weeks ago and was continued on Megace for control of
metastatic disease.  At that time she was stable, ambulatory,
and feeling very well without neurologic complaints.  The
patient was doing well at home until Thursday, when she got her
foot tangled and fell (i.e. a mechanical fall). She did not hurt
her head or lose consciousness.  However, immediately following
the fall she experienced increased neck pain, mainly on the R,
and noted increased difficulties in ambulating, with weakness in
her right arm and right leg.  She denies any numbness or
tingling. The weakness has not progressed over the last days.
Because she was concerned about lack of improvement, she
notified her physicians who advised her to be immediately
evaluated in the ED.

No bladder or bowel symptoms. Patient received decadron 10mg iv
x1 in ED. Ortho-spine and neurology were consulted as well.

Review of systems:
Denies fever, chills, weight loss, visual changes, hearing
changes, headache, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, tingling,
numbness, bowel-bladder dysfunction, chest pain, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, or bright red blood
per rectum.

IMAGING;

MRI of the head w/wo gad:[**2112-10-23**]
No new lesions are seen. The left parietal mass is
redemonstrated. While a metastatic neoplastic focus would seem a
reasonable consideration, given the widely metastatic disease
elsewhere, a resolving hemorrhage could be considered, with
infection being less likely.

CT of C-SPINE W/Contrast : [**2112-10-24**]
There is loss of vertebral body height at C3 with some
retropulsion of bone into the spinal canal. There is bone
destruction in the right side of the posterior elements
extending to the midline. There is a fracture of the spinous
process of C3. There is no significant displacement of the
fracture fragments. The vertebral body collapse is unchanged
from the prior plain film. There is stable appearance of the
compression fracture of the C5 vertebral body. The prevertebral
soft tissues are again prominent.

BILATERAL LOWER EXRTREMITIES DOPPLER [**2112-10-31**]:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.

CTA OF THE CHSET W/CONTARAST AND RECONS;10/31/2205
1. Segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli involving the
pulmonary arterial branches supplying the left lower lobe.
2. Extensive mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, not
significantly changed since the prior examination.
3. Multiple nodular opacities are again demonstrated within both
lungs, with interval increase in the degree of cavitation
involving two left lower lobe nodular opacities. These findings
most likely represent pulmonary metastases.
4. Interval worsening of ill-defined left upper lobe nodular
opacity.
5. Minimal decrease in size of the right pleural effusion with
compressive right lower lobe atelectasis.

CARDIAC ECHO;11/03/2205
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect.  The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are  mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
