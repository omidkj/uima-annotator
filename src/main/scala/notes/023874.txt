History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 74 yo M with CAD, HTN, PVD, DM type II with
neuropathy s/p amputation of right first, second, third toes
several years ago and underwent recent revision of right hallux
amputation due to chronic ulcer/skinbreakdown from bony spur.
He had been healing well with no complications from the
procedure.  However, on the day prior to admission the VNA noted
a white scab on the surface of the incision.  At that time there
was no erythema at the site.  He was also noted to be weak,
lethargic and less interactive over the past three days.  He
additionally had poor PO intake.  He did not have any fevers
over the three days - despite being checked frequently.  He
presented to podiatry clinic as he had been having foot
discomfort the day of admission.  During this appointment he was
noted to have pus over his incision site.  While at the
outpatient clinic, pus and [**Known lastname **] were able to be expressed from
the area.  He was sent to the ED for further work up.
.
Of note, his daughter has also recently been concerned for a
change in his mental status over the past two days, specifically
that he was more lethargic and weak than usual.  At baseline he
ambulates with a walker, however recently he has refused to walk
due to weakness and foot discomfort.  She noted that he was
leaned to the left in his chair which was not typical.  She was
concerned that he had some right sided weakness, however he was
never examined for this.  He did not have slurred speech or
facial droop.
.
This year he was admitted in [**Month (only) **] for bilateral pulmonary
embolism and in [**Month (only) **] for acute renal failure.

intact.  Labs were notable for lactate of 4.0, Cr 1.3, glucose
