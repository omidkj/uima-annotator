Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, SOB, fever, transferred from OSH for respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Subclavian CVL (at OSH)
Intubation / Extubation
CVL insertion ([**Hospital1 18**])

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 50F smoker with ?history of COPD, chronic
headaches on narcotics, fentanyl patch has increased to 75
recently. She also has a history of HLD, ?DM, PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **].
She presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital on [**7-18**] with SOB, fever
and chest pain. She was having 1 week of SOB associated with
non-productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, wheezing,
generalized myalgias and fever/chills. She was treated with nebs
high grade E. coli bactermeia and respiratory failure. On
admission she received a CXR, TTE and a CT. CT was consistent
with diffuse nodular ground glass opacities, small bilateral
effusions([**7-19**]). CTA and LENIs negative. TTE on [**7-18**] showed LVEF
55-60%, mild MVP and mod MR, LAE and mild LV dilation. She was
treated with DuoNeb, Xopenex nebs, Solumedrol 60mg IV Q8hrs and
Dilaudid. 4 out 4 BCx positive for Pan-sensitive E.Coli, she was
treated with various ABx including: Ceftazidime, Levaquin([**7-21**]),
Cipro and Azithromycin. On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] she was on Levaquin
500mg IV QDay and Azithromycin. Urine and LFTs unremarkable.
[**Date range (1) 45402**] she had increased work of breathing requiring BiPAP,
NRB mask and eventually required intubation for worsening
respiratory acidosis (7.23/55/59 on 5L). She received 2 doses of
Pancuronium for agitation, coughing, dysynchrony, desaturations
and elevating PIPs. She has been having minimal secretions and
tracheal aspirations were negative for organisms. She received
20mg IV Lasix x2 and put out 1.6L.
.
[**7-22**] patient CXR showed developing bilateral fluffy bilateral
infiltrates. She was given 20mg IV Lasix for LE edema, elevatged
BNP and elevated CVP after a Subclavian line was placed. CVP
reduced to 12 after Lasix.

Vitals on transfer from OSH: Afberile, sinus rhythm at 109 bpm.
BPs 110-160s on propofol 100mcg. MAPs 70-80s. Vent settings 400

===========================================
Imaging:
[**7-22**] CXR:
1. Diffuse parenchymal opacification is in keeping with clinical
diagnosis of ARDS.
2. Endotracheal tube in standard position with tip 5.1 cm above
the carina

[**7-22**] CT Abdomen
1. Diffuse patchy opacities within the lung fields along with
wedge-shaped
infarctions along bilateral lung bases, raise the possibility of
septic
emboli.
2. No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
3. Numerous renal and liver cystic lesions of various size seen
in polycystic kidney disease.

[**7-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**7-22**], there has
been some decrease in the still prominent diffuse bilateral
pulmonary opacifications. Monitoring and support devices remain
in good position

[**7-27**] CXR: Previously widespread infiltrative pulmonary
abnormality improved
substantially between [**7-25**] and [**7-27**] has not changed,
raising concern for acute pulmonary embolism or other
abnormality not detectable on
conventional radiographs. There is no consolidation or collapse.
No pleural
effusion or pulmonary edema. Heart size is normal. ET tube and
right internal jugular line are in standard placements and a
nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.

[**7-28**] EEG: Abnormal EEG due to diffuse and prolonged slowing in
the delta range with superimposed alpha rhythm, both anteriorly
and posteriorly. The record is consistent with a diffuse mild to
moderate encephalopathy without evidence of focality or of
increased irritability.

[**7-29**] CXR: Single AP view of the chest shows an ET tube 4.2 cm
above the
carina. An OG tube and IJ line are in standard position. Lung
volumes are
low, however, there is no consolidation or collapse. No pleural
effusion or
pneumothorax. Heart size is normal.

[**7-29**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is no pericardial effusion.

No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).

[**7-30**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung
volumes have
slightly increased, poten
