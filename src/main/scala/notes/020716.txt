Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 yr old man with CAD on HD while awaiting
transplant. He was taken to the OR on [**3-9**] for a CABg x4
(LIMA-LAD, SVG to OM, [**Month/Day (4) **] and acute marginal) [**3-9**].  See
operative note for details. Mr. [**Known lastname 1870**] remained intubated and on
neosynephrine and was transferred to the ICU for ongoing
invasive monitoring. He was weaned from the vent and
successfully extubated on POD#1. He received ongoing
hemodialysis throughout his hospital stay. He was transferred
from the ICU on POD #1. Returned to the ICU on POD#2 for
hyperglycemia. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to manage hyperglycemia. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was transferred from the ICU to the floor again on POD#4
with improved glycemic control. His chest tubes were removed and
CXR was without evidence of pneumothorax. He was given a dose of
betablocker and became bradycardic but remained hemodynamically
stable. Once HR stabilized, his pacing wires were d/c'd. On
POD#5 he was noted to have serosanguinous drainage from the
lower [**12-11**] of his sternal wound. His WBC was normal and remained
afebrile. He was started on keflex. His chest Xray revealed a
moderate left effusion from which he was asymptomatic with room
air oxygen saturations of 97%. He was evaluated by physical
therapy and cleared for discharge to home on POD#7.
