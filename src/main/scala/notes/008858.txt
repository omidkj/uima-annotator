Chief Complaint:
retroperitoneal bleed

-Abdominal angiogram with IR guided embolization of
pseudoaneursym of L3 aorta branch ([**2147-4-25**])
-Abdominal angiogram with IR guided embolization of
pseudoaneursym of L3 aorta branch ([**2147-4-29**])

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 81 yo female with hx of RA, with recent
L4-L4 back laminectomy in [**12-17**], with chornic back pain, who had
5 recent kyphoplasties in Flordia, after which deveoloped a RP
bleed when being restarted on her anticoagulation for her St.
[**Male First Name (un) 923**] MVR.

She was transfered from [**State 108**] today to be further treated. She
had her vertebroplasty procedure in [**State 108**] on [**4-2**]. Hemaglobin
was before the procedure was 12 per son, then fell and she was
given 2 units of blood on [**2147-4-9**]. She then had a upper and lower
GI scope that found inflammation per son, but no bleeding in
colon, duodeunum, and stomach. She was discharged on [**2147-4-13**] with
stable blood counts. Then felt severe abdominial pain the next
day. She was taken to ER and had a CT of the abdomen ([**2147-4-14**])
that found a large PR bleed and a L3 fracture of the transverse
process. She had been off anticaoguation during her kyphoplasty,
and was restarted on 5mg for 2 days, then had an INR of 2.7 on
[**2147-4-13**]. On the day of the RP bleed the INR was 5.1. She was
given vitamin K IV and FFP. She had a repeat CT scan in 12 hours
with no change. She was transfused 5 units over two days. Then
requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], where she has her regular care. (MD
# in FLA is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96676**]).

On the floor, minimal abdominal pain, no SOB, no CP. Would like
to eat. Understands risk of bleeding vs stroke.
