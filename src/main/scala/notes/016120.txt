History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 50463**] is a 29 year old female with history significant
for anxiety, asthma and active IV drug abuse who was most
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-2-10**] after undergoing a
tricuspid valve replacement and mitral valve repair on [**2188-1-25**]
for MSSA endocarditis.  Her post-operative course was
complicated by persistent fevers with tachycardia/tachypnea (HR
in 120's and RR
in 20's-30's), multiple bilateral septic pulmonary emboli with
abscess formation, and significant right pleural effusion which
required a chest tube during her hospitalization.  The pleural
fluid cultures were negative for organisms, the patient had
negative PCR for C. diff, and she was discharged to [**Hospital **]
rehab on Zosyn. Prior to discharge a CT of the chest was
obtained
and demonstrated persistence of her bilateral pulmonary
abscesses, increased lower lobe consolidation, but no increase
in pleural effusion following removal of her chest tube. At the
time, a decortication procedure was not determined to be
warranted.

Not long following discharge the patient began having episodes
of tachycardia and tachypnea and a CTA performed demonstrated
new pulmonary emboli. She was thus transferred from rehab for
further evaluation.

[**2188-2-21**] Chest CT
CT CHEST
FINDINGS: Left central catheter tip is in the upper SVC.
Extensive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy has improved. For instance a
prevascular lymph
node measuring 6 mm was 8 mm. A right lower paratracheal station
lymph node
measuring 11 mm was 13 mm. The main pulmonary artery is still
enlarged
measuring 3.3 cm. A small pericardial effusion has decreased.
Patient is
status post MVR and TVR. Cardiac size is minimally enlarged,
unchanged from prior. Layering nonhemorrhagic small bilateral
pleural effusions have
decreased.
Numerous cavitary lesions throughout both lungs have decreased
in size. Lower lobe consolidations and right middle lobe
consolidations have also markedly improved. Still there is some
air in the pleural cavity bilaterally, more so on the left.
There are no new lung opacities.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation. As before there is fatty infiltration of the liver.
There are no bone findings of malignancy.
IMPRESSION:
1. Improved multifocal pneumonia and multiple areas of septic
emboli.
Improved mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
2. Decrease in pericardial effusion.

[**2188-2-14**] Echo
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular ring appears
well seated with normal gradient. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] A
bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present. The prosthetic
tricuspid leaflets appear normal. There is a very small
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Mildly dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle
consistent with primary pulmonary process (COPD, pulmonary
embolus, etc.), Well-seated, normally functioning mitral
valvuloplasty ring. Well-seated normally functioning
bioprosthetic tricuspid valve. Very small pericardial effusion.
Left pleural effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 50463**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-2-11**] for further
management of her pulmonary emboli. The thoracic surgery service
was consulted. A CT scan was performed which showed a pulmonary
embolism. She completed her course of zosyn for pseudomonas. She
continued nafcillin for her MSSA endocarditis, per the
recommendation of the infectious disease service. Her stop date
is [**2188-2-27**]. Her pain was controlled with dilaudid, oxycodone,
and motrin.  [**Month/Day/Year 197**] and heparin were started for her pulmonary
emboli. Lasix was started for her pleural effusions.  She was
started on diltiazem for better heart rate control.  An
echocardiogram revealed decreased right ventricle function
consistent with pulmonary embolism. [**2-21**]/ she went for a follow
up chest CT scan which per Radiology revealed: Improved
multifocal pneumonia and multiple areas of septic
emboli,improved mediastinal lymphadenopathy,and a decrease in
pericardial effusion. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 7343**] from Thoracic reviewed the Ct
scan and determined there was no significant change and that she
does not need to follow up with him unless there is a new issue.
She continued to make slow progress and was discharged to the
[**Hospital **] Hospital Rehabilitation Center on [**2188-2-22**]. She will
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist and the infectious
disease service as noted in the discharge paperwork. She will
call to schedule appointments with her primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 197**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 702**] should be arranged prior to discharge from
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation. She prefers to be monitored by Dr.
[**Last Name (un) 92402**] for [**Last Name (un) **] dosing if possible upon discharge
from rehab.
