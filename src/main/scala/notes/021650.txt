Brief Hospital Course:
Brief hospital course by problem
.
# DKA: Patient presented with elevated blood glucose up to high
500s and initially had an anion gap of 30.  This DKA was thought
to be due to his worsening depression and subsequent poor PO
intake and non-adherence to his insulin regimen.  He was
initially treated with IVF, Insulin drip, and aggressive
electrolyte repletion.  His blood sugars resolved to a normal
range and his anion gap closed.  Upon discharge he was eating
POs, and returned to his home insulin regimen.  He was seen by a
[**Hospital **] clinic consult who made changes to his sliding scale
dosing of humalog.  This was implemented for future diabetes
coverage.  He has [**Hospital 1988**] follow up at [**Hospital **] Clinic for
further management and teaching around his diabetes.

seizures or DTs. Patient was given thiamine, folate, MVI.

ideation.  He was seen by social work for support as well as
