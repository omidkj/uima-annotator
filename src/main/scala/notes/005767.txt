Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Alendronic Acid / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
diaphoresis, bilateral shoulder pain, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
catherization with proximal left anterior descending stent
placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old female with a h/o hypercholestrolemia but
no known coronary disease, 50+ pack year tobacco history who was
at [**Hospital1 18**] for an eye appointment when she experienced bilateral
shoulder discomfort, diaphoresis, and nausea.  Initial EKG
showed evidence of an anterior STEMI (2-3 mm elevations in leads
v1-v4 with ST upsloping in v5 and v6, and reciprocal ST
depression of 2 mm in inferior leads).  Subsequent catherization
was significant for a 100% proximal LAD occlusion, and the
patient recieved a PTCA/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  The Left Marginal, Left
Circumflex, and the Right Coronary were normal.  Hemodynamics at
time of catherization showed  CO/CI 3.30/1.98 PA 23/15 PCWP 4.
During the procedure, the patient became hypotensive with a SBP
in the 60s.  She was started on pressors, fluids, and a balloon
pump was placed to increase forward flow.  Patient's hypotension
initially improved and she was subsequently transfered to CCU
for close observation and management.  Patient again became
hypotensive and uncomfortable, and tenderness in the RLQ was
noted as [**Doctor Last Name **] as a pulseless/cool right lower extremity.  The
patient post-cath Hematocrit was found to be 19, and she was
immediately transfused 4 U of PRBC and put back on pressors. The
Balloon Pump was pulled and a CT showed evidence of a
retroperitoneal bleed.  Patients hypotension eventually resolved
with medical management, she was taken off of pressors, and her
Hematocrit stabilized.


Past Medical History:
1.  Hypercholestrolemia
2.  Osteoporosis
3.  s/p Cholecystectomy
4.  s/p Hysterectomy

CT ADOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST:
There is bibasilar atelectasis. The heart and pericardium are
unremarkable. A right femoral approach Swan-Ganz catheter is
present. The liver, pancreas, adrenals, and kidneys are
unremarkable in appearance. The spleen is somewhat small in
size. The patient is post cholecystectomy with clips seen in the
gallbladder fossa. The intraabdominal large and small bowel are
unremarkable. High density fluid is seen in the parahepatic and
parasplenic spaces. There is a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage
on the right side of the abdomen which extends into the right
pararenal space and into the pelvis. No free air or pathologic
lymphadenopathy is seen within the abdomen. Note is made of
interposition of the large bowel between the liver and anterior
abdominal wall.

CT PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST:
The retroperitoneal hemorrhage is seen to track into the pelvis.
There is stranding of fat throughout the pelvis. A large right
groin hematoma is present. There is a right femoral approach
catheter. A Foley catheter is seen within a collapsed bladder.
There is marked bladder wall thickening, likely secondary to the
surrounding hemorrhage. The rectum and sigmoid are unremarkable.

The osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
Large right sided retroperitoneal hemorrhage tracking into the
pelvis. There is also a right groin hematoma. High density fluid
is seen in the parahepatic and parasplenic spaces represents
intraperitoneal hemorrhage. These findings were communicated to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the completion of the study.


PTCA COMMENTS:
  Initial angiography demonstrated a totally occluded proximal
LAD.  We
elected to treat this lesion with PTCA/Stenting.  Heparin and
Integrilin
were administered prophylactically.
  The patient was enrolled in the FLAME trial (Filterwire EZ
distal
protection device for STEMI).  A 7 French XBLAD 3.5 guide
provided
adequate support.  The filterwire would not cross the lesion,
and a PT
[**Name (NI) 9165**] Intermediate wire was passed into the distal LAD.  A 2.5
x 20 mm
Maverick was used to dotter through the lesion, restoring flow.
The
balloon was then inflated at 8 atm, and a 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher DES
was
deployed at 14 atm, jailing the 1st diagonal.  The patient
became
somewhat hypotensive, requiring atropine and pressors, but the
flow in
the LAD and diagonal was normal after administration of
diltiazem.  The
stent was then post-dilated with a 3.5 x 9 mm NC Ranger at 16
atm and 14
atm.  Distal vasodilators were administered through an Ultrafuse
X
catheter.  Given the patient's persistent hypotension, an
intra-aortic
balloon pump was placed through the right femoral arteriotomy
site.
Right heart catheterization demonstrated low filling pressures,
and
fluids with peripheral vasconstrictors were administered.
  Final angiography demonstrated no dissection, no residual
stenosis
within the LAD, with minor ostial narrowing of the jailed D1.
The LAD
and D1 flow was TIMI 2 fast.  The patient left the lab and wa
