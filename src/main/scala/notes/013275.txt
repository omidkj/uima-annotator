History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 40 year old previously healthy woman with a
history of depression and anxiety presenting with right pleural
effusion after laproscopic cholecystectomy performed at an
outside hospital.  16 days prior to admission to the medicine
team patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with RUQ
abdominal pain.  She was given the diagnosis of cholescystitis
and had laproscopic cholesectomy.  Post-op it was noted that she
had developed a "low output bile leak picked up by JP tube".  12
days prior to admission, she then had ERCP with sphincterotomy.
It was then reported that the JP output decreased and was then
removed.  11 days prior to presentation Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] still complained
of RUQ, had a fever of 103.2 and became hypoxic A chest CT was
preformed that showed bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral
PNA with no intra-abdominal abnormalities.  VQ scan for plumary
embolis was negative. 10 days prior to admission patient was
started on Zosyn for PNA.  6 days prior she had a repeat chest
CT that showed larger right pleural effusion with partial
collapse of RLL and smaller left pleural effusion.  Pt reports
that she was disatisified with the level of care and service
that she was recieving from [**Hospital3 **], so 4 days prior
to medicine admission, she was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] surgery team
where her temperature ranged from 97.8-102.8 and her right
pleural effusion became worse.

At the time of interview patient complained of constant, diffuse
abdominal pain, [**11-22**], that radiated to her lower back.  She
also stated that she had SOB with exerction accompanied with
sharp pain in her sternum and right upper portion of her chest.
When questioned she denied having the pain when she inhaled.

Patient was at times an unreliable source due to her tendancy to
perseverate on old injuries, bizarre affect and she was
intermittently uncooperative with interviers (see MSE).

Past Medical History:
[**5-/2184**]-accident involving escalator requiring 5 orthopedic
surgeries that left her disabled only able to get around with a
walker/cruches/wheelchair; otherwise previously healthy denies
HTN, DM and cancers.

Social History:
Lives by herself in [**Location (un) **], MA in a "handicap" apartment; went
to [**State 15093**] where she recieved her bachelors,
worked as a financial consultant and teacher before accident;
widowed x 8 years was married for 3 years with no children.
ETOH-occasional
Tobacco-denies past or present use
Sexual history-denies history of STDs, denies sexual activity,
can't remember last pap smear, LNMP [**2190-5-2**]

Family History:
Parents died 20 years ago in accident, patient became tearful
and did not want to discuss their health or that of any other
family members.

Physical Exam:
VS: t 98.6 (98-98.6)  BP 142/90 (140-142/70-90)  P 82 (82-104)
RR 22 (22-26)  O2sat 97% on non-rebreather (95-97% on NRB)
General:  Obsese, disheveled woman lying in bed, in mild
respiratory distress
Skin:  Bluish-[**Doctor Last Name 352**] macules on abdomen, otherwise unremarkable
HEENT:  normal cephalic, atraumatic	
Neck:  not assesed  	
CV: Regular rhythm, nl s1 and s2 with no extra heart sounds or
murmurs, dorsalis pedial pulses palpated bilaterally		
Resp: No breath sounds heard throughout right lung field, mild
wheezing heard over left lung field, no crackles appreciated	
Abd:  Obese, scars from laproscopic cholesectomy healed well;
hypoactive bowel sounds, no masses felt, non-tender on
palpation, non-distened		
Ext:  No muscle atrophy, swelling, patient walks with cane.
Strength and reflexes not assesed
Neuro:  CN II-XII grossly intact
MSE:  Patient was disheveled in apperance and seemed agitated
she would frequently comb and pull at her hair.  Her behavior
was inconsistent towards interviewers at some points she be
cooperative and at other times she would become hostile.
Patient's speech was sometimes labored and slurred, but not
pressured.  Her stated mood was not assesed, her affect was
bizarre and labile, she would start crying when talking about
her parents or her current medical condition and then the next
minute start laughing at a joke she made.  She preseverates on
her accident that occured in [**2184**] and was tangential, it was
sometimes impossible to get her to directly answer a question.
Patient denies active SI/HI, however she frequently states that
she wishes that she could go home lie down and die, but states
that she does not want to try to kill herself because of her
catholic faith.  Memory and concentration was not assesed.

Micro:
No growth of pathogens noted in blood, urine, sputum, and
pleural fluid cultures. Stool was negative for C. difficile
toxin. Pleural fluid negative for malignant cells.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2190-5-30**]
Moderate loculated right-sided effusion again noted with
interval decrease in component tracking along the major
fissure.There are multiple linear and patchy areas of
atelectasis as described above. A superimposed infectious
process cannot be entirely excluded.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2190-5-24**]
1) Decrease of previously identified right-sided effusion with
continued markedly loculated moderate-sized right-sided
effusion. There has been reexpansion of the right lower lobe
with continued multifocal areas of atelectasis. While the
etiology of this loculated effusion is presumably due to
pneumonia, the radiologic differential diagnosis also includes
sequela of collagen vascular disease, malignancy, or TB if an
infectious etiology is not clearly established.
2) Left thyroid nodule as discussed previously.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2190-5-27**]
1. Continued right intrafissural loculated pleural effusion,
smaller, with right middle and lower lobe atelectasis.
2. Left lower lobe atelectasis and probable small loculated
pleural effusion.
3. Continued small right lateral apical loculated pleural
effusion.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2190-5-20**]
1) No ascites or intra-abdominal fluid collection.
2) Interval marked decrease in right pleural effusion. Residual
bibasilar atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
40 year old woman status post laparascopic cholecystectomy at
OSH complicated by bile leakage into peritoneum, status post
ERCP with sphincterotomy also at OSH, course complicated by
right lower lobe pneumonia and right pleural effusion.
.
RLL pneumonia/pleural effusion: Patient was transferred from the
surgical service to the medical service on [**2190-5-19**] with RLL
pneumonia, R pleural effusion x 5d, and fever spiking through
Zosyn.  She was seen by intervental pulmonology on
