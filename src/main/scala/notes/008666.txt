Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 60-year-old female with oxygen-dependent COPD who was
admitted from an [**Hospital3 **] facility for "failure to
thrive" over the past several days as well as shortness of
breath.  These are according to paperwork.  However, the patient
actually denies any changes in her breathing.  She has not had
any cough, increased sputum production, or shortness of breath.
She has had fevers and sweats.  She has not had any chest pain,
abdominal pain, or nausea.

She does state that she has not been getting out of bed as much
as usual.  She was hospitalized in [**Month (only) 205**] and treated with
antibiotics and steroids for COPD flare.  She states that she
has been tired, and has not been getting out of bed because the
facility staff have made her sleep in a different position and
she is not as comfortable.  She denies depression.

She has not had dysuria or increased urinary frequency, but she
does wear a depends.  She has noted more foul smelling urine
over the past few weeks.  She has not had any headache, limb
weakness, or numbness.  She has not had a good appetite.

In the ED she was given Levaquin for a possible pneumonia, and
she was ordered for 60 mg of Prednisone which she refused.

Past Medical History:
1. COPD (FVC 23% predicted, FEV1 15% predicted), on oxygen 3L NC
2. Hyperlipidemia
3. Anxiety disorder
4. Sinus tachycardia


Social History:
She lives in [**Hospital3 **].  She does not smoke and does not
drink alcohol.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
T 97.1, HR 100, BP 98/54, RR 20, O2 sat 95% on 2L
GEN: Cachectic, thin caucasian female in no acute distress.
HEENT: Supple neck. No elevated JVP. No cervical LAD. Dry MM.
Anicteric sclera.
CV: Distant sounds. No murmurs.
LUNGS: No dullness to percussion. Very little air movement
throughout. No crackles or wheezes.  She is mildly tachypneic
and does breath through pursed lips.
ABD: Scaphoid. Soft. Nontender. Nondistended.
EXT: No leg edema or calf tenderness.
NEURO: Oriented. CN II-XII intact bilaterally. Grip strength 5/5
bilaterally. Sensation grossly intact in all four limbs.  She
initially was slow to respond to questions, but did give
appropriate answers with very understandable speech.  However,
she improved during the H&P and she stated that she was tired
because I woke her up from sleeping.
SKIN: Dry skin, no rashes.

CXR:
The lungs are significantly hyperinflated consistent with
underlying obstructive lung disease.  There are large bullae in
the apices.  There is a rounded opacity projecting within the
left costophrenic angle.  Otherwise, the lungs are clear with no
superimposed edema.  There is atherosclerotic disease of the
aorta.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for size.
 No definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There is height
loss of L2 which may represent compression fracture of
indeterminant chronicity.

IMPRESSION:  COPD.  There is a focal opacity projecting within
the left
costophrenic angle of indeterminant origin.  This may represent
a focus of
early consolidation, possibly pneumonia.  Correlate with
clinical exam.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Atrial abnormality. Poor R wave
progression. No ischemic changes.

Other Studies:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2197-7-21**] 2:28 AM
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass, mass effect,
or large vascular territorial infarction. The ventricles and
sulci are normal in caliber and configuration. No fractures are
identified.

There is hypodensity in bilateral periventricular white matter
likely due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. There is
also a region of hypodensity in the posterior limb of the left
internal capsule consistent with an old lacunar infarct. If
clinically indicated, MRI of head with diffusion study is more
sensitive for acute CVA.

IMPRESSION:
1. There is no evidence of acute intracranial process.
2. Hypodensity in the posterior limb of the left internal
capsule consistent with an old lacunar infarct.

EEG ([**7-21**]):
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Frequent episodes of left frontotemporal
moderate
amplitude theta frequency slowing were noted.
BACKGROUND: An 8 Hz somewhat disorganized and poorly modulated
rhythm
was noted in the waking state. This attenuated appropriately
with
frequent eye blinking.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as this was a portable
study.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: The patient remained in the waking or drowsy state.
CARDIAC MONITOR: The cardiac monitor was obscurred by movement
and/or
electrode artifact for the majority of the tracing.
IMPRESSION: This is an abormal portable EEG due to the presence
of
intermittent left frontotemporal slowing, suggestive of an
underlying
region of subcortical dysfunction. No epileptiform features were
noted.
No electrographic seizure activity was seen.

EEG ([**7-22**]):
FINDINGS:
ROUTINE SAMPLING: Showed an alpha frequency background rhythm
posteriorly during wakefulness. At other times, there were brief

periods of theta frequency slowing seen in the left temporal
regions.
There were no clearly epileptiform features and no
electrographic
seizures were noted.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to slow wave
sleep at
appropriate times and with no additional findings.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with
occasional
PVCs.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no clearly epileptiform
features
in any of these entries. The majority were due to EKG or
electrode
artifact.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 9 entries in these files.

Several of these files demonstrated brief one to two second
bursts of
high amplitude polymorphic slow wave activity at a frequency of
about 4
Hz lasting two to three seconds at a time prior to return to the

previous background rhythm. Several of these events occurred
without an
accompanying video making it difficult to comment on whether
they are
related to movement or other artifact. They were not clearly
epileptiform however.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were one. There was no clear
change in
the electrographic tracing with this pushbutton. On video, the
patient
was seen sitting up in bed being attended to by nursing staff.
She was
answering questions appropriately.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured one pushbutton activation
during
which there was no clear change in the electrographic tracing.
Routine
sampling and spike and seizure detection programs, for the most
part,
showed a normal background rhythm with occasional periods of
left
temporal theta frequency slowing suggestive of an underlying
area of
subcortical dysfunction in that region. In addition, seizure
detection
programs demonstrated brief bursts of high amplitude polymorphic
slow
waves in a more generalized distribution. Unfortunately, there
was no
accompanying video for these detections making it difficult to
comment
on their exact nature. Th
