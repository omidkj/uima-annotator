Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year-old woman a history of bronchiectasis,
dementia, presumed microaspiration and recurrent aspiration
pneumonia, s/p recent discharge on [**2117-1-28**] for pneumonia being
treated with vanc/zosyn (to complete on [**2117-2-3**]), who presented
yesterday for management of chest pain and is transferred to the
MICU for afib with RVR and hypotension.
.
She was feeling well until [**2117-2-1**] when she developed substernal
CP that was not associated with diaphoresis, nausea, or
vomiting. EKG in the ED was negative and she ruled out MI. CXR
suggested new retrocardiac infiltrate versus atelectasis. On the
floor, she entered afib with RVR 120-140s (new diagnosis) at 2
a.m. and SBP dropped from 90s to 70s after a dilt 5 mg IV push.
She was asymptomatic. A bolus of 500cc was started with SBP
improvement to 80s, ASA 325 given, and MICU was consulted for
transfer because of increased nursing requirements.
.
In the MICU the patient's SBP in 90s to 100s with pediatric cuff
and the pressors that were temporarily started were stopped. A
bronchoscopy was performed that showed evidence of aspiration
and cultures were sent. Swabed for flu and negative. A TEE was
done that showed hyperdynamic LV.


Past Medical History:
- bronchiectasis - felt [**3-2**] recurrent microaspiration, was due
for video swallow at rehab facility [**12-7**]
- Dementia
- Neuropathy
- Osteoporosis
- Chronic venous stasis ulcer
- Gallbladder polyp seen on u/s - needed follow up in [**8-6**]
- presumed recurrent aspiration pneumonia
- Chronic Venous Stasis Ulcer
- h/o AFB positive - MYCOBACTERIUM CHELONAE


Social History:
The pt previously worked as a graphic designer and a painter
with watercolors. She is a never smoker. She drinks 3oz of wine
with dinner, less than daily. She denies any recreational drug
use. She denies any known exposure to asbestos or tuberculosis.
[**Name (NI) 105966**] sister has moved here to help her.


Family History:
The pt's mother died of an enlarged heart, and her father died
of pneumonia (age 40-50). She has a deceased brother and sister,
from unknown causes. She does have a living sister on [**Hospital3 **].
She never had any children.

Physical Exam:
VS:  T 96.8 HR 64 BP 122/75 RR 20 Sats 91% RA

CHEST: decreased lung sounds at bases, no wheeze, no rhonci
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN: No apparent scars. Non-distended, and soft without
tenderness
EXTREMITIES: no peripheral edema, warm
NEUROLOGIC: 5/5 strength x 4, grossly oriented

   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.

   ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2117-2-4**]):
      NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON CONCENTRATED SMEAR.

   ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):

[**2117-2-5**] CXR: Moderate left and small right pleural effusions have
increased. Heart size is normal and there is no evidence of
elevated central venous pressure. Therefore bibasilar
opacification is more likely atelectasis or pneumonia, rather
than asymmetric edema, and unchanged since [**2-3**]. Heart size
is normal. No pneumothorax. Left PIC can be traced as far as the
low SVC.
.
[**2117-2-3**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function imay be more depressed given
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in
the presence of elevated right sided pressures.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year-old woman a history of bronchiectasis,
dementia, afib w/ RVR who p/w recurrent aspiration pneumonia
.
# Chest pain: The patient was ruled out for an MI. Her chest
pain was likely [**3-2**] aspiration pneumonia. A bronch done in MICU
showed exidence of possible aspiration PNA, but nothing has
grown from bronch sputum cultures. Urine legionella negative and
viral culture negative. Patient was scheduled to finish her
previous course of antibiotics for hospital aquired
pneumonia(HAP) on [**2117-2-3**]. These antibiotics were continued for
several additional days while further diagnostic tests were
pending. Repeat CXR was stable. It was decided that the patient
had adequately been treated for HAP/aspiration and antibiotics
were stopped [**2117-2-6**]. The rationale was that the pathogen was
likely treated, cultures were negative (including endobronchial
sample), the patient's clinical status was improving
dramatically, and further antibiotic treatment would predispose
her for resistent organisms especially given her continued
aspiration risk. In regards to her aspiration risk, this has
been addressed on her previous hospital admission and the
patient is aware of the risk, but still prefers to eat regular
food. The patient was discharged breathing on room air.
.
# Hypotension: Resolved. There was a question of sepsis, but no
growth on urine or blood culture. Most likely [**3-2**] afib w/ RVR.
.
# Afib with RVR: TSH normal. MI ruled out. Her rate is currently
adequately controlled with no medications.
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI
