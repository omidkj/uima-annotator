Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Small LV cavity.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%. No
resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. Cannot assess regional RV
systolic function.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: No MS. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] TR. Indeterminate PA
systolic pressure.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs.[**Known lastname 12130**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for preoperative surgical
workup and Heparin
bridge while off Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation. Prior to
her admission Dental Clearance was obtained. On [**2183-9-29**] she was
taken to the operating room and underwent replacement of her
ascending aorta with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Circulatory Arrest time=15
minutes. Please refer to operative report for further surgical
details. She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the CVICU intubated and sedated, requiring inotropy and pressor
support. She was kept intubated overnight. POD#1 she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She was confused and
had worsening respiratory status and a low mixed venous despite
inotropes which required reintubation. Initially she weaned off
Milrinone. Poor cardiac output/mixed venous results warranted an
echocardiogram which showed the heart to be underfilled and
volume was administered. Milrinone was resumed. [**10-1**] EP was
consulted in the setting of afib with rapid ventricular rate.
Per EP, Mrs. [**Known lastname 12130**] likely has significant diastolic
dysfunction given her LVH and would benefit from rate control
and restoration of sinus rhythm. She is high risk for embolus
given history of
LAA thrombus and was not yet back on anticoagulation. Per EP
recommendations, an Esmolol drip was initiated to allow more
diastolic filling time, she was placed on Digoxin and
anticoagulation was resumed with Coumadin. She again weaned off
inotropic support. On [**10-2**] HIT panel was sent secondary to
postoperative thrombocytopenia, which resulted negative. She was
placed on a lasix gtt for worsening pulmonary edema and
diuresed. Her pulmonary status improved and  on [**10-3**] she was
weaned to extubation. All lines and drains were discontinued per
protocol. She remains in a rate controlled atrial fibrillation
on beta-blocker, Digoxin, and anticoagulated with Coumadin. Her
thrombocytopenia has been consistently improving. POD# 6 she was
placed on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection.
She remained in the CVICU until POD 8 when she was transferred
to the step down unit for further monitoring and increased
physical activity. Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation
of strength and mobility.  The patient was discharged to
*****[**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay****** on POD 9.
