Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated ([**2185-6-24**])

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
77M history of schizophrenia, neurogenic bladder presenting from
NH with ACS with resuscitation at [**Hospital1 2177**] 1 month ptp, brought in by
EMS due to hypoxia, concern for PNA at nursing home. The patient
is schizophrenic per history and is unable to provide a history
of his own.  Per discussion with the floor nurse from his
nursing home, a CXR was obtained 4 days prior to admission for a
cough that was consistent with a pneumonia.  He was started on a
Z-pack.  One day prior to admission, he developed tachypnea and
started to desaturated in the the low 80's.  EMS were call and
he was stat low 90's on a NRB.  He was brought in by Ambulance.

In the ED, initial VS were T 99, HR 120, BP 104/79, RR 24
satting 92% on NRB.  Labs showed WBC of 10.1, HCT of 43, plts
305.  LFTs showed AP of 214 otherwise WNL.  Coags were WNL.  CMP
showed hypernatremia of 150, Cl of 112, BUN 33, with rest of BMP
in normal range,  Lactate was 2.1, and valproate level was 27.
ABG was checked and pH was 7.51, pCO2 of 28, pO2 of 72.  Given
tachypnea and hypoxemia as well as high work of breathing,
patient was intubated with fentanyl and midazolam for sedation.
Noted was food in oropharynx/larynx per ED resident on
intubation.  His CXR showed a questionable aspiration pneumonia
as well as possible LLL process. CT scan showed bilateral PE and
likely pneumonia.  He was empricially provided with
levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

His blood pressure dropped to 70/40 just before transfer to the
ICU. After an 3 additional 3L NS SBP increased to 100's.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CT ANGIO CHEST [**2185-6-24**] -
TECHNIQUE:  CTA of the chest was performed per department
protocol.  Oblique sagittal and coronal reformats were available
for review along with the axial images.
CT OF THE CHEST:  There are small pulmonary arterial filling
defects in the subsegmental bronchi supplying the lingula (4:71)
as well as additional filling defect in the subsegmental right
lower lobe bronchi (4:87).  An additional area of segmental
pulmonary embolus is seen in the apical segment of the right
upper lobe (4:33).  There is no evidence of right heart strain.
Within the right middle and upper lobe there are extensive
nodular opacities as well as several more gound glass appearing
areas of opacity (4:61 and 4:27).  There is extensive
atelectasis of the right lower lobe (4.83) with relative
[**Name (NI) 71062**] peripheral area within the collapsed lung.  No
definitive arterial supply with embolus is seen in this area;
however in the setting of other emboli and configuration of this
finding, it is concerning for infarct.  There is no pleural or
pericardial effusion.  In the left hemithorax, there is a large
hiatal hernia with stomach and GE junction above the diaphragm.
This causes compressive atelectasis (4:102) on the adjacent
lung. The patient is intubated with endotracheal tube
terminating approximately 4 cm from the carina.  An nasogastric
tube is seen in the esophagus but does not reach the GE junction
or the stomach. Subdiaphgramatically, gallstones are seen. The
aorta and the great vessels appear unremarkable. No suspicious
lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen within the bones.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Right middle and upper lobe nodular opacities as well as
several areas of ground-glass opacity consistent with infectious
process.
2.  Bilateral pulmonary emboli in the segmental and subsegmental
levels with no evidence of right heart strain. There is an area
of hypoenhancement within the atelctatic right lower lobe along
the periphery concerning for infarction.
3.  Complete right lower lobe atelectasis.
4.  Large diaphgramatic hernia.
5.  Cholelithasis.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND [**2185-6-24**] -
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of the left common femoral, left
superficial femoral, left popliteal vein show normal
compressibility, flow and augmentation.  Note is made of
duplicated left superficial femoral veins. The left calf veins
show normal flow. Grayscale, color, and spectral Doppler
examination of the right common femoral vein shows normal
compressibility and flow.   Note is made of duplicated right
superficial femoral veins. There is partially occlusive thrombus
noted within
one of the right proximal superficial femoral veins which is of
unclear
chronicity.  The distal superficial femoral vein, the entire
length of the
other superficial femoral vein,  popliteal vein appear patent.
The right
posterior tibial veins were patent.  The right peroneal veins
were not
visualized.

IMPRESSION:
1. Partially occlusive thrombus noted within one of the two
right proximal
superficial femoral veins which is of unclear chronicity. Right
peroneal veins were not visualized.
2. No DVT in left lower extremity.

ECHO [**2185-6-24**] -
Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 55%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to
position. Suboptimal image quality - ventilator.
Conclusions
Technically suboptimal study.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). No definate aortic regurfgitation is seen. The
mitral leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a very prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation.
