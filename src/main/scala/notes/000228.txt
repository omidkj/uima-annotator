CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old man s/p MVR/CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate pleural effusions
INDICATION: Status post CABG.

CHEST PA AND LATERAL: The moderate left-sided and small
right-sided effusions are unchanged since [**2138-12-19**].
There has been interval removal of the right IJ sheath. Interval
improvement of the mild pulmonary edema. The biventricular pacer
is present with its leads in unchanged position. Left lower lobe
collapse/consolidation is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of mild pulmonary edema with
stable bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe collapse.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Regular ventricular pacing, unchanged compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2138-12-15**].

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE

complications. The patient is in a ventricularly paced rhythm.

Conclusions:
Prebypass

1.The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Resting regional
wall motion abnormalities include severe hypokinesia of the
basal, mid and
apical portions of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
basal and mid
portions of the anterior septum are also hypokinetic. Suboptimal
transgastric
images. LV is severely dilated. Due to poor transgastric views
unable to get
adequate measurements.

3.There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.


4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic
aorta.

5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
no systolic
anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. The mitral
regurgitation vena
contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric.

7.The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

8.The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. Significant
pulmonic
regurgitation is seen.


Post Bypass

Patient is receiving infusions of epinephrine, milrinone and
phenylephrine.

1. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.

2. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the mitral position. Trace
central mitral
regurgitation present. Valve appears well seated and the
leaflets move well.
Mean gradient across the prosthetic valve is 3 mm Hg.

3. Aorta intact post decannulation.

[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**2138-12-15**] for IV heparin pre-op for MVR  Carotid U/S
revealed < 40% stenosis bilat.  Renal consult obtained due to
rising creatinine (from baseline of 1.5 to 2.2 on [**12-16**]) Lasix
was decreased, lisinopril was discontinued.  He was taken to the
OR on [**2138-12-17**] for CABG X 1 (SVG>RCA), MVR (tissue), ligation of
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**].  He was taken to the cardiac surgery recovery unit
post-op, on milrinone, epinephrine, phenylephrine drips.  The
vasoactive drips were weaned off over the next 48 hours, and he
remained hemodynamically stable.  His ICD was interrogated on
POD # 1.  He was transferred to the stepdown floor on POD # 2.
He was re-started on his Coumadin (target INR 2.0-2.5 for Afib).
 He has progressed slowly from a mobility standpoint, remained
stable hemodynamically, and is ready to be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility to aid in mobility and independence.
