CT ANGIOGRAM:

The patient is status post placement of endovascular stent.
There is no sign of migration of the stent compared to prior
study, with its proximal margin just at the origin of the SMA
and extending distally with the longer limb
extending into the left common/external iliac artery junction
while the
shorter right limb terminates at the right common iliac artery.
Again seen the endoleak in the aneurysmatic sac, in similar
amount as in prior study. In the late venous phase, there is
phasing out of the contrast
enhancement. On today's study, the impression is that the
endoleak originates from the area of overlapping stent- grafts
(endoleak type 3).
Both renal arteries arise at or just below the top of the
endovascular stent, with a very stenotic origin of right renal
artery. The left common iliac artery aneurysm is unchanged in
size (13 mm), with the endovascular limb feeding the left
external iliac artery and the excluded enhancing portion is
feeding the left internal iliac artery. Again seen thedifference
in enhancement between the right internal iliac artery and the
left internal iliac artery (which is fed by the excluded portion
of the left common iliac artery).


IMPRESSION:
Compared to prior study performed in [**2127-10-14**], again
seen is the
endoleak in the aneurysmatic sac. On today's examination, the
impression is of a Type 3 endoleak.

All the other previously described findings are unchanged
compared to prior study, as follows:

1. Left iliac artery aneurysm. Difference in contrast
enhancement of left and
right internal iliac arteries.
2. Hypodensities seen in spleen that could represent infarct; an
ultrasound
examination is recommended for further evaluation.
3. Simple cyst in left hepatic lobe.
4. Bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
5. Incidental left lower lobe lung nodule. A dedicated chest CT
scan is
recommended for further evaluation of other nodules.
6. Atrophic right kidney with delayed nephrogram and no
excretory phase could
be secondary to a significant stenosi at the origin of the right
renal artery.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**10-8**]: Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Pt urgently taked to the OR for EVAR.

PROCEDURE:  Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.
Introduction of catheter into the aorta.
Bilateral femoral artery exposure M-50
Zenith bifurcated modular graft placed
Right limb graft placed with extension.
Left femoral graft placed with extension.

He tolerated the procedure well. No complications. Intubated.

Precautions taken for hx of renal failure, Bicarb drip.

Transfered to the CVICU in stable condition post operative

[**10-9**]: CVIU intubated and sedated. Making good urine. Had bump in
creat to 1.6.
Lines remain in.

[**10-10**]: CVICU. Extubated. PO pain meds. Drop in HCT to 26. Making
good urine. Creat   bump to 2.2. kept NPO. HCT followed.
Transfused 2 units PRBC.

[**10-11**]: Transfered to the VICU. Nitro for HTN. Creat improved to
1.9. Diet advanced. PT consult. HCT stable after PRBC. Making
good urine. OOB.

[**10-12**] - [**10-13**]: stable / ambulating / delined. Foley DC making
urine. IS support.

[**10-14**]: Creat stable at 1.5. Mucomyst PO and IV bicarb given in
preperation for CTA. recieves CTA. Endoleak seen. HCT stable.
EKG DC'd. Nitro weaned with PO HTN medications. Made floor
status.

[**10-15**] - [**10-16**]: Creat normalizes. HCT stable. Preperation for
Angiogram: Again given Mucmyst and bicarb protocol. Making good
urnine.

[**10-16**]: goes for angio under general:

OPERATION PERFORMED:

1. Exposure of left common femoral artery and primary repair
2. Introduction of catheter into aorta.
3. Abdominal aortogram.
4. Balloon angioplasty of proximal extension cuff of
    endograft(aorta) and left CIA and EIA

Extubated in the OR. Sent to the PACU for recovery. IOnce
recovered from the PACU sent back to the VICU for recovery.

[**10-17**]: Delined. heplocked. Making good urine. Creat stable at
1.6. OOB to chair. foley left in. Diet advanced. Drop in HCT to
23 post op Transfused 2 units PRBC. Needs nitro for HTN:

Cardiology consult for persistant HTN; PO medications adjsted.
HTN adjusts.

[**10-18**] - [**10-20**]: Foley DC'd. Making good urine. Creat remains
stable. Normotensive with adjustment of pain meds. Ambulating
with PT. Had to be given lasix for fluid overlaod secondary to
CHF Systolic chronic stable. Creat stable at 1.5. Mucomyst PO
and IV bicarb given in preperation for CTA. recieves CTA.
Endoleak seen, much improved.

[**10-21**]: recieves PMIBI for future open AAA repair. Pt deciding
wether or not to have an open procedure. He is being DC'd today
understanding the risk of rupture. His creatinine is stable.
Normotensive on PO medications. Making good urine. HCT stable.

VNA to check HCT and BP at home.
