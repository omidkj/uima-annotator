Admission Date:  [**2180-5-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-6-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2112-4-25**]       Sex:  F

Service:  FENARD INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoxia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old woman with
a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history
of right upper lobe pneumonia, status post prolonged
intubation with trache and PEG placements from [**2177-11-24**] to [**2178-12-25**], full exercise tolerance at
baseline, chronic productive cough with thick-clear sputum,
but otherwise not on home O2 or po prednisone, who has been
in her usual state of health until about a week prior to
admission when she started to experience increased fatigue,
and shortness of breath, and productive cough.  But otherwise
no fevers, chills, no overt upper respiratory infection,
urinary tract infection, or abdominal symptoms.

Two days prior to admission, her family noticed a dramatic
worsening of shortness of breath and increased sputum
production, but otherwise no change in the color or blood in
the sputum.  She also had significant worsening of appetite
for two days.  She fell at home the day prior to admission
due to extreme weakness.  She was on the floor for about 15
minutes, but no loss of consciousness.  She was brought into
the Emergency Room by her family.

Her head CT scan was negative for hemorrhage.  Her shortness
of breath was much better with nebulizers and IV steroids.
However, the next day while she was still in the Emergency
Room, she was noticed to have increased lethargy, and was
electively intubated for an arterial blood gas of pH 7.24,
pCO2 84, and pO2 of 73.  She became significantly hypotensive
after intubation and required 10 liter normal saline
resuscitation.  She was started on Neo-Synephrine for blood
pressure support.  She was given a dose of levofloxacin and
Vancomycin for empiric coverage of possible sepsis.  Her
chest x-ray and chest CT scan in the Emergency Department
suggested right upper lobe pneumonia or other processes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2. Severe emphysema and bronchitis.  Pulmonary function tests
in [**2178-6-24**] showed a FVC of 1.85 liters, FEV1 0.73
liters, and a FEV1/FVC ratio 39%.
3. Hypertension.
4. Vitamin B12 deficiency.
5. Alcohol and benzodiazepine dependency.
6. History of tuberculosis exposure versus infection.
7. Osteoporosis.
8. Status post right upper lobe pneumonia in [**2178-10-24**]
to [**2178-12-25**] with prolonged intubation with trache and
PEG placement.

ALLERGIES:
1. Bactrim with nausea.
2. Orajel with benzocaine with dermatitis.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Combivent two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
2. Serevent two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
3. Vitamin B12 250 mcg po q day.
4. Flovent two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
5. Klonopin 1 mg po bid.
6. Atrovent.
7. Remeron 30 mg q hs.
8. Diltiazem 120 mg po bid.
9. Multivitamins one tablet po q day.
10. Stool softeners.
11. Oxycodone 5 mg prn for pain.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Two packs per day until last year after the
pneumonia.  Still smokes now and then.  Regular alcohol use.
Lives with her son and grandson.

EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.0, heart rate 74, blood
pressure 85/35, respiratory rate 16, O2 saturation 100% on
FIO2 100% with vent setting of tidal volume 350, rate of 16,
PEEP of 5, FIO2 1.0.  General:  She is intubated, but easily
arousable, thin, chronically sick appearing, but otherwise in
no acute distress.  Head and neck examination is anicteric.
Oropharynx is clear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and
rhythm.  Lungs:  Equal breath sounds bilaterally,
significantly prolonged expiratory phases.  Abdomen is soft,
normal bowel sounds.  Extremities no edema.  Neurologic:
Moves all extremities.  Lines with Foley and ET tube.

LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  Arterial blood gas 7.24, 84, 73
preintubation.  After intubation, 7.07, 25, 459.

Complete blood count:  White count of 34.3, hematocrit of
43.5, platelets 474.  PT of 16.0, PTT 53.4, INR of 1.7.
Sodium 135, potassium 4.6, chloride 96, bicarb 31, BUN 9,
creatinine 0.5, glucose of 133.  Urinalysis is negative.

Chest x-ray showed increased capacity and pleural thickening
at the right upper lobe concerning for infection, TB versus
aspergillosis, versus actinomycosis, versus mucomycosis, and
also need to rule out neoplasts.

Chest CT scan:  Diffuse emphysematous changes with bullae,
right apical thick walled cavity suggesting semi-invasive
aspergillus, versus TB, versus actinomycosis, versus
mucomycosis, versus neoplasts, multilobular pneumonia, versus
aspiration, multiple liver lesions.

Head CT scan:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

Sputum Gram stain showed [**11-25**]+ gram-positive cocci.  Culture
was essentially negative.  Had some oral flora.  Urine
culture negative.  Blood cultures were negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient had remained relatively stable
through her hospital stay.  She finished a 10 day course of
Vancomycin for a possible MRSA pneumonia.  She continued to
have low grade temperatures, but her white counts came down
significantly to her baseline around 16.  Since her initial
hypertension was thought most likely secondary to intubation
instead of sepsis, she was aggressively diuresed through her
hospital stay, and she received 10 liters normal saline
initially in the Emergency Room.

Although her respiratory status continued to improve
significantly, she was not able to be weaned off vent at this
time.  She had a trache and PEG placed so she can be
discharged to rehab for slow weaning of ventilation.
Decision was made to discharge her to rehab with Lasix drip
in order to diurese her about 1 liter negative everyday until
her weight is down back to her baseline or her BUN or
creatinine start to increase.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.
