HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 80-year-old white
female with a past medical history significant for non-Q-wave
MI on 6/[**2155**].  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] from [**Hospital6 33**] with a
question of small-bowel obstruction.  The patient was in her
a bowel movement.  Prior to admission she felt bloated,
although she did not have any nausea or vomiting, but had
stopped passing gas approximately two days prior to
admission.  The patient was brought to [**Hospital6 33**]
on [**8-9**] secondary to increased abdominal pain, which was
diffuse across the lower abdomen, mostly crampy.  She was
admitted and fluid resuscitated at [**Hospital6 33**].  NG
[**Hospital **] Hospital showed dilated loops of small bowel with an
air-fluid level.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1,  The patient was found to have small-bowel obstruction and
she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.
Past medical history is significant for non-Q-wave MI in
[**2155-6-21**], at which time approximately four cardiac stents
were placed.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient had a colectomy
approximately 30 years ago and vaginal hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known allergies to
medications.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Serevent two puffs q.h.s.
2.  Combivent 2 puffs q.i.d.p.r.n.
3.  Albuterol and Atrovent 25/500 q.i.d.
4.  Zantac 50.
5.  Ativan 2 mg q.4h. to 6h. for anxiety.
6.  Morphine for pain.
7.  Hydralazine 2 mg IV q.8h. for blood pressure control.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a long-term smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed the following:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.4,
blood pressure 150/20, pulse 82, respiratory rate 16,
saturation 93% on room air.  HEAD AND NECK:  Head and neck
examination:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles are intact.  Mucous membranes moist.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient is clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  She is moving air well.  CARDIAC:  Examination
showed regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 without
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Abdomen was noted to be
soft, distended, with mild tenderness diffusely.  There is no
guarding or rebound.  EXTREMITIES:  Without edema, stools
were guaiac negative at that time.

LABORATORY DATA:  Prior to admission, labs drawn at [**Hospital6 3622**] revealed the white count of 11.0, hematocrit
37.1, platelet count 346,000, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, BUN
25, creatinine 1.3, glucose 132, calcium 10.5, magnesium 1.9,
LFTs and ALT 1125, AST 21, amylase 20, lipase 22.

On [**2155-8-11**], the patient received a CT scan of the abdomen,
which demonstrated multiple loops of small bowel with a
region of narrowing in the right lower quadrant and iliac
fossa consistent with mechanical small-bowel obstruction,
single low attenuation cyst in the liver, tiny gallstone
without evidence of cholecystitis, scattered sigmoid
diverticula without diverticulitis, extensive vascular
calcification in the region of the mesenteric artery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's CT findings, it was
decided that the patient would be taken to the operating room
for emergent exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.
On [**2155-8-11**], the patient had the exploratory laparotomy and
she tolerated the operation well.  Approximate blood loss was
200 cc.  She was transfused intraoperatively with six units
of platelets, 800 cc crystalloid.
Intraoperative central line was placed,
and a chest film was obtained to confirm placement

The patient was transferred from the operating room to the
Post Anesthesia Care Unit.  From there, she was transferred
to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for observation and
monitoring after laparotomy given her history of non-Q-wave
MI and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient was evaluated
by the Cardiology Service, where she was noted to have
transient right bundle branch block and the Post Anesthesia
Care Unit decided to resume her Aspirin.

Overnight, from postoperative day #0 to postoperative day #1,
the patient did not have any major events.  She was continued
to be monitored in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  In the
Intensive Care Unit it was decided to diurese the patient.
She was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells.
The hematocrit was noted to increase to 29.7.  Overnight,
from postoperative day #1 to postoperative day #2, the
patient was noted to have low urine output.  While in the
ICU, the patient was kept NPO.  She was noted to have an
increasing hematocrit after infusion of one unit of packed
red blood cells.  On [**2155-8-12**] the patient received a
transthoracic echocardiogram, which demonstrated preserved
left ventricular ejection fraction.  It was decided to start
Lopressor on the patient for rate and pressure control.

From postoperative day #2 to postoperative day #3, the
patient continued to do well without major events.  The NG
tube was noted to be draining 350 cc from postoperative day
#2 to postoperative day #3.  Again, the patient was noted to
have a low hematocrit of 27.7 on [**2155-8-13**].  The patient
continued to do well, although she did have one episode of
anxiety.  It was decided on [**2155-8-13**] to change the patient
from a pCO2, regular morphine prn.  She was found to be
stable on Lopressor and IV Vasotec.  She was transfused again
with one unit of packed red blood cells.

During the evening of [**2155-8-13**], the patient was transferred
from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor, where she was
noted to be doing well with no overnight events from [**8-13**] to
[**8-14**].  Overnight, from [**8-13**] to [**8-14**], the patient's NG tube
put out approximately 150 cc.  She was still not passing
flatus.

On postoperative day #4 to postoperative day #5, [**2155-8-14**] to
[**2155-8-5**] the patient continued to do well.  She had
decreased abdominal pain, and she was able to ambulate.  The
patient remained without flatus.  The patient was diuresed
3.5, which was repleted.  At this point, total parenteral
nutrition was started for the patient.  The patient tolerated
TPN well and she was advanced to goal total parenteral
nutrition on [**2155-8-15**].

On [**2155-8-16**], the patient was evaluated by rehabilitation
services and physical therapy.  The patient was noted to be
making progress with ambulatory ability.

Overnight, from [**2155-8-16**] to [**2155-8-17**] the patient noticed
increased amounts of flatus.  She was able to pass flatus at
this point.  She remained on TPN on [**2155-8-17**].  The NG tube
was noted to put approximately 250 cc out on [**2155-8-16**].

On [**2155-8-17**] to [**2155-8-18**] the patient continued to do well.
On [**2155-8-17**], the patient had the NG tube pulled.  She is to
be taking small sips.  TPN was continued, IV fluids were not.

On [**2155-8-18**], the Dermatology Service was consulted for a
facial rash.  Their impression was that she was an
80-year-old female with onset of malar rash after treatment
for small-bowel obstruction.  They prescribed hydrocortisone
1% cream for the patient, which seemed to help with the
contact dermatitis.

Overnight, [**2155-8-18**] to [**2155-8-19**], the patient complained of
some shortness of breath to approximately 4 in the morning,
which was relieved with nebulizers.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient was found to have a hematocrit
of 26.  TPN was continued through [**2155-8-19**].  On [**2155-8-19**],
the Pulmonary Service was consulted because of the patient's
complaint of dyspnea.  Their impression was that she was an
80-year-old female with known chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease status post myocardial infarction and recent
abdominal surgery with the differential diagnosis for
episodes of dyspnea were mostly multifactorial with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  They recommended
increasing Atrovent to four puffs b.i.d.; restarting Flovent
and checking for PFTs.  Also, the differential diagnosis of
bronchitis with in
