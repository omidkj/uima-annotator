Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
ICH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 81 yo woman with HTN, AF, and severe AD who presents
with an ICH with intraventricular spread.  She was in her USOH
and went to bed at 8 pm last night.  Her husband was up at
midnight and note her light was on. He went in and she was on
the floor at the foot of the bed.  He doesn't know how she got
there and for how she had been there.  She said yes/no, but
didn't seem to be answering appropriately.  She had a right
hemiparesis and facial, as well as dysarthria according to the
EMS sheets.  She continued to talk in the ambulance, but started
to deteriorate at the OSH.  She had a CT which showed a left BG
hemorrhage with ventricular extension, but no frank
hydrocephalus.  She was given 1 gram cerebryx and transferred
here. She did not get any treatment for her INR of 1.5 due to
coumadin use.
  Here, she was unresponsive and was intubated before my
examination.  She was given Proplex, 2 units of FFP, 5 mg SQ
vitamin K, and 1 mg ativan, and finally propofol.  Her BP was
labile with ranges from 160s systolic to 100 range after
propofol bolus.  A repeat head CT was largely unchanged, with a
~12 cc hemorrhage with extention to all venticles, with most
blood in the left lateral ventricle.  She was found to have a
fever, but a normal CXR.  No UA has been sent yet.

Head CT:
Large left basal ganglia hemorrhage, with intraventricular
extension and mass effect as in HPI. Has ~10 mm midline shift
here.

CXR:Satisfactory positioning of endotracheal tube.  Mild
pulmonary edema.

CT c-spine: Negative for fracture

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, 81 year old woman with hypertension, atrial
fibrillation and severe alzheimer's disease who presents with
intracranial hemorrhage with intraventricular spread after being
found down by husband. She was intubated for airway protection
and was noted to have right sided weakness, arm more pronounced
than leg which was consistent with her hemorrhage.

On head CT, there was spread of the hemorrhage to all
ventricles, making obstructive hydrocephalus a concern. She did
have midline shift. She was seen by neurosurgery who did not
intervene given the risks of the procedure and the very low
likelihood of regaining any sizable amount of function after
this event. Her coagulopathy was reversed in the emergency
department. Her bleed remained stable over serial head CTs.

Causes of hemorrhage include: HTN, hemorrhagic mass, AVM,
amyloid angiopathy, stroke with hemorrhagic transformation.  In
this location, hypertension is the most likely cause. She had a
urinary tract infection which she was treated with
ciprofloxacin.

She was admitted to the neuro ICU with goals of keeping her
blood pressure <150/90, keeping her INR reversed, covering with
seizure prophylaxis (dilantin) and continuing digoxin 0.125mg
for her ongoing afib/aflutter. She ruled out for myocardial
infarction with three negative cardiac enzymes.

Upon admission paitent was full code however given the poor
prognosis likelihood of any recovery requiring a feeding tube
and nursing home level of care, patient was subsequently made
DNR and then extubated as the her husband expressed that she had
expressed to him that she would not have wanted the above
situation to go on. The patient's family came to a decision to
make her comfort measures only. Patient passed away from
respiratory failure on [**2133-10-12**]. Her family was notified.
