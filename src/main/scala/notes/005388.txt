Service:  GOLD SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old female
with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency,
gastroesophageal reflux disease who is status post childhood
head injury who presented to the Emergency Room with 12 hours
of multiple episodes of projectile vomiting.  She is a
resident of [**Hospital 2670**] Nursing Home and there at that facility
was started on intravenous fluids.  A nasogastric tube was
also placed which returned approximately 1500 cc of
questionable bilious material with reported coffee grounds
and was also reported heme positive.  In the Emergency Room,
a KUB was done which showed air fluid levels and dilated
small bowel loops consistent with a small bowel obstruction.
She was admitted to the medical service, was made NPO,
started on intravenous fluids and her nasogastric tube was
kept to low wall suction.  Her nasogastric was putting out
about 150 to 350 cc per day, however the patient continued to
complain of diffuse abdominal pain with distention.  There
was no report of flatus or bowel movements, although the
patient was somewhat unreliable.  Due to the patient's
failure to improve, a CT scan was obtained which showed
dilated loops of small bowel with free fluid in the abdomen
and the possibility of a closed loop obstruction.  A surgical
consultation was called at that time and it was, upon review
of the CT scan, thought that the patient had a complete small
bowel obstruction.  She was then taken to the Operating Room
for exploratory laparotomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency
3.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%
to 30%.
4.  She is status post appendectomy.
5.  Hypothyroidism
6.  Degenerative joint disease
7.  Anemia
8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease

LABORATORY AND IMAGING STUDIES:  White blood cell count 5.9,
hematocrit 32.5, platelet count 198.  Chemistries:  Sodium
140, potassium 4.2, chloride 106, CO2 26, BUN 44, creatinine
1.5, glucose 121.  Initial CK was 31.  KUB from [**2191-3-11**] showed dilated small bowel with air fluid levels, no
clear transition point.  Abdominal CT from [**2191-3-13**]
showed dilated loops of small bowel with free fluid in the
abdomen.  No free air.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient postoperatively was then
transferred to the general surgical service.  She underwent,
on the [**3-12**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] exploratory laparotomy with lysis of
adhesions under general endotracheal anesthesia.
Intraoperatively, a complete small bowel obstruction with a
closed loop and multiple adhesions were found.  There were no
complications.  She was transferred to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit intubated and sedated where she stayed secondary to
her cardiac history, history of congestive heart failure and
prolonged preoperative illness.  She was extubated that
evening in the PACU and remained stable from a respiratory
standpoint.  Her nasogastric continued with minimal output.
She was at her baseline mental status.  She was placed on a
rule out myocardial infarction protocol secondary to her
history.  She also required placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter
for accurate assessment of her fluid status.  She was also
kept on Lopressor, cardioprotective as well as to manage her
heart rate and blood pressure.  She continued NPO.  Her urine
output was initially low.  She received multiple fluid
boluses and the Swan-Ganz catheter as previously mentioned.
She was also placed on Venodynes, subcutaneous heparin and
Protonix for prophylaxis.  She remained in the Intensive Care
Unit until postoperative day #3, during which time she ruled
out for a myocardial infarction and remained hemodynamically
stable.

On postoperative day #4, she remained afebrile,
hemodynamically stable.  The patient reported passing flatus
and her abdomen was soft and flat.  She was started on sips.
PT consult and rehabilitation screen were done.  Her home
medications were restarted.  On postoperative day #5, the
patient was tolerating sips well and she was advanced to
clears with aspiration precaution.  She did well on this and
in addition her Foley catheter was removed secondary to not
needing to follow her urine output as closely.  She continued
to do well, was advanced to a regular diet on postoperative
day #6 and was deemed stable for discharge back to her
rehabilitation facility on postoperative day #7.  She
remained afebrile throughout her hospital course was and was
hemodynamically stable both in and out of the unit.  She
continued to make good urine, tolerating a regular diet and
was accepted at her previous living facility.
