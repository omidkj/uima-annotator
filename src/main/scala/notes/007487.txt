Brief Hospital Course:
Upon cardiac catheterization on [**2145-12-8**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found
to have an LMCA 20% diffuse, proximal LAD long 80%, diffuse 40%
LCx proximal, 50% OM1, and RCA mid 40% and 90% distal.  After
allowing for a plavix washout, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the OR
and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times three (LIMA
to LAD, SVG to OM1, SVG to PLB).  He tolerated the procedure
well and was able to be transferred in critical but stable
condition to the surgical intensive care unit.  He was given
Vancomycin perioperatively for 48 hours because of his
pre-operative inpatient status. In the unit he was found to be
in atrial fibrillation for which he was started on amiodarone.
His chest tubes and wires were removed.  He was started on
coumadin for his atrial fibrillation and quickly became
supertherapeutic.  His INR was allowed to drift down and he was
restarted on low dose coumadin.  He experienced some confusion
which improved with Haldol.  By post operative day 6 he was
transferred to the floor.  He was seen in consultation by the
physical therapy service.  He was ready for discharge to rehab
on post-operative day 7.
