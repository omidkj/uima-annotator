History of Present Illness:
68 yo male history of HTN, DM, prior IMI w systolic CHF (EF
40%), recent GI bleed of uncertain etiology ([**8-/2124**]) who
initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] with reported
indigestion, fatigue and DOE that started two days prior. He
first noticed indigestion incl passing gas and burping, followed
by the acute onset of DOE with heavy breathing.  His DOE was
profound upon raking leaves, and resolved with rest.  He noted
some chest tightness that was worse with deep breathing but
denies a positional component.  He also reports fatigue for the
past few weeks.
.
On review of history, he reports spending a lot of time doing
yard-work, but denies any camping/fishing/hunting.  He reports
that he has been noncompliant with his diet recently, but denies
any excess salt intake.  He has two pets who he often reports
finding ticks on.  Denies any rashes, arthralgias, flu-like
illnesses.  On review of systems, he reports occaisional
palpitations at night, and a 30lb weight loss while he was
hospitalized in [**Month (only) 216**].  In addition, he reports nocturia, loose
stool, and numbness in his feet.  He has chronic arthritis and
stiffness in his hands.  He denies chest pain, orthopnea, and
PND.  He denies fever, chills, nightsweats.  He denies URI,
cough, or recent cold.

As these symptoms were consistent with his prior episode of
anemia [**2-16**] GI bleed, he presented to OSH, where his exam was
reported as significant for systolic blood pressures in the
130s, engorged tick on his neck (which was removed), guaiac
positive stools.  Labs were significant for WBC 19 (N89%), Hct
29.2 (his baseline), Cr 3.3, K 6.4, TropI 6.18.  At [**Last Name (LF) 16962**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EKG
demonstrated complete heart block with junctional escape in the
40s.  Patient was admitted for further workup.  Inpatient stay
was significant for rising TropI to 40, with continued DOE and
absence of CP.  Patient was started on IV heparin and ASA 325mg
for concern for ACS, and CTX given concern for possible
Disseminated Lyme. TTE reported unchanged inferolateral akinesis
and EF 40%.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
Currently he is comfortable with the exception of some mild
indigestion.

ECGs:
1. [**2124-11-29**]: Sinus rhythm with A-V dissociation. Left atrial
abnormality. Lateral ST segment abnormalities and ST segment
elevation in leads III and aVF. These findings are consistent
with active inferolateral ischemic process. Rule out myocardial
infarction. Followup and clinical correlation are suggested. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
2. [**2124-11-30**]: Sinus rhythm with A-V dissociation as previously
recorded on [**2124-11-29**]. There is further evolution of acute
inferolateral ischemia and QT interval prolongation. Rule out
myocardial infarction. Followup and clinical correlation are
suggested.
.
TTE ([**2124-11-30**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral segments. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. LVEF 45%.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with mildly depressed regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, as described above. Mild mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
CXR ([**2124-12-2**]):
The patient has received a right-sided PICC line. The course of
the line is unremarkable, the tip of the line projects over the
right atrium, and the line could be pulled back by approximately
3 cm. There is no evidence of complications, notably no
pneumothorax. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper
range of normal. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  No
pleural effusions. Normal hilar and mediastinal contours.
