Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheal intubation
Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
52 yo m with schizophrenia, HOCM, found at group home face down
in pool of vomit, found to have Na 99 at [**Hospital 46**] Hosp, got
hypertonic saline, corrected to 107 by the time he got to our
ED. Intubated here for airway protection and went to MICU. Na
corrected rapidly with NS and subsequently had difficulty waking
up from sedation. MRI head negative for CPM. EEG negative for
sz. After long course of weaning, he was extubated, but then
re-intubated because of secretions. Was treated with vanc/zosyn
for VAP. Negative cx's thus far (only needs 8 day courrse of
vanc/zysyn, now day #6). Extubated 2 days ago, now on RA.
Hyponatremia thought [**1-17**] psychogenic polydipsia. Became
subsequently hypernatremic, thought to have renal DI due to
lithium that he took in [**2189**]. Renal following. Had worsening
HTN, had required labetolol gtt. Started on
captropril/amlodipine. Uptitrated BB. CT abd found mass c/w
renal cell CA, needs workup (onc has not yet been consulted).
Currently thought to be at baseline mental status. Also has had
12 sec run of Vtach. EP was consulted.
On the floor, the patient was hypertensive to 180 SBP and was
given Hydral IV 10mg x 1.

.
[**11-11**] CT C-spine:
1. Multilevel degenerative change with no fracture identified.
2. Mild overdistention of the endotracheal tube cuff.
3. Bilateral thyroid nodules, when feasible,U/S recommended.
4. Posterior opacity in the right upper lung, possible
aspiration
.
[**11-11**] CT Maxillary sinus:
1. No definite fracture identified.
2. Moderate ethmoid sinus opacification and air-fluid level in
the left maxillary sinus in this intubated patient. An
air-filled level could suggest acute sinusitis. There is no
hyperdensity within the fluid in the left maxillary sinus to
suggest an occult fracture.
.
CT head:
1.  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  No fracture
identified.
2.  Moderate ethmoid sinus opacification with air-fluid level in
the left
maxillary sinus likely due to intubation.
.
CT abdomen and pelvis:
1.  4-cm heterogeneous left renal mass, highly suspicious for
renal cell
carcinoma.  As this study was performed without IV contrast,
either a
dedicated CT urogram or MRI is recommended to further assess.
2.  Trace amount of left perinephric fluid and stranding,
however, no evidence
of significant retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal hematoma.
3.  Bibasilar consolidation and small effusions, most likely
relating to
aspiration.
4.  Asymmetric enlargement of the left gluteal minimus muscle
with prominent
subcutaneous stranding, consistent with contusion.
5.  Very limited study for assessing for any other potential
lesions or
metastases without IV or oral contrast.
.
EEG:
This is a moderately abnormal EEG due to the presence of a
slow and unvarying background, consistent with a moderate
encephalopathy
of toxic, metabolic, and/or anoxic etiology. No evidence of
ongoing
seizures was seen despite the presence of limb jerks as recorded
by the
technologist.
.
MRI: There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
There is
mild sulcal prominence as noted on the prior examination of
[**2190-8-4**].  There is ventricular prominence also.  The
ventricles are dilated slightly out of proportion to the size of
the sulci although there are unchanged from the prior exam.
Could this patient have mild communicating hydrocephalus?
There is extensive pansinus opacification.  However, the patient
has recently been intubated and these findings could be due to
that procedure.  There are no enhancing abnormalities.  There is
no midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus.  There are no
areas of abnormal magnetic susceptibility.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old male with hyponatremia, possible aspiration on CT,
intubated for airway protection.
.
# Hyponatremia - From psychogenic polydipsia.  patient was
initially given hypertonic saline for short interval. He
subsequently corrected himself rapidly ([**1-17**] requiring large
volumes NS due to hypotension); concern was raised for central
pontine myelinolysis. MRI was negative for this but did show a
question of stable communicating hydrocephalus. Renal was
following. With fluid restriction, patient became hypernatremic,
which was attributed to diabetes insipidus in the context of
past Lithium use. Sodium was monitored closely and fluid
restriction was discontinued.  He likely has greater than 4L
free water requirement and should be allowed to drink to thirst
only instituting fluid restriction if Na<130.
.
# Hypotension: briefly after admission Mr. [**Known lastname **] became
tachycardic and hypotensive requiring large volume repletion.
It was likely that his hypotension was [**1-17**] both volume
depletion, sepsis, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
He was started on levofloxacin and flagyl to cover for
aspiration pneumonia which was switched to vanco/zosyn as below.
 As his blood pressure improved with IVF beta blockers were
started to prolong filling time and improve his cardiac output
from his HOCM.
.
# Airway protection - patient intubated, was weaned and
extubated after prolonged wake up phase but was not able to
adequately clear copious secretions and was reintubated.
Treatment for VAP was started with Vanco and Zosyn. He improved
and was again extubated on hospital day 8. He was doing well
subsequently. Given that no gram negative rods were present on
sputum culture or gram stain, a total of 8 days would be
sufficient.
.
# Altered mental status: difficulty to wean of sedation with
intermittent unresponsiveness. EEG ruled out seizure acitvity.
MRI did not show any evidence of stroke or anoxic brain injury.
Neurology was consulted and did not see any neurological
deficit. After extubation the patient was felt to be at his
baseline. He was restarted on all home medications with good
effect. Delirium was monitored on the floor with the help of
psychiatry, and mental status cleared several days prior to
discharge.
.
# Pnuemonia: Mr [**Known lastname **] was treated for aspiration pneumonia
on admission with levofloxacin and flagyl; he later developed
fevers refarctory to this and was changed to vancomycin and
zosyn for empiric VAP.  His sputum as grown GPC.  He should have
an 8day course of IV abx.
