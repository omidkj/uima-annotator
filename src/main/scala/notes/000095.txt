HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
female with history of myelodysplastic syndrome,
hypercholesterolemia with recent diagnosis of bilateral
adrenal masses found during a workup for acute renal failure
in an outside hospital, who was transferred from an outside
hospital ([**Hospital3 **]) after developing fever,
tachycardia, and hypotension.  Apparently, patient presented
on [**4-18**] at [**Hospital3 **] with acute renal failure,
hyperkalemic with K of 7.3 and hyponatremic with a sodium of
130.  During workup of patient's acute renal failure at
[**Hospital3 **], patient had an abdominal CT, which showed
bilateral adrenal masses measuring up to 7.5 cm in AP
diameter on the left and 6 cm in AP diameter on the right.

Patient was then discharged and represented for an adrenal
mass biopsy on [**4-28**], and was sent back to [**Hospital1 **]
Transitional Care Unit.  On [**4-29**], then patient then
developed tachycardia and fever at [**Hospital3 **].  Chest x-
ray was consistent with CHF.  Patient was given nitro paste
and Lasix, and then became hypotensive to the 60's.
Dobutamine was started at outside hospital and patient
received levofloxacin for a question of UTI as well as
vancomycin.  She was also given a dose of Solu-Medrol for a
question of adrenal insufficiency.  Prior to Solu-Medrol
administration, serum cortisol was checked at outside
hospital and was low at 13.  Patient also had an aldosterone
checked at that time, which was low at 3.0, normal range is 4
to 31.

Patient was started on dobutamine and dopamine at the outside
hospital.  Dobutamine was then discontinued and Neo-
Synephrine was started.  Patient had only received a 250 cc
normal saline bolus prior to the start of pressors.
Abdominal CT scan was performed, which showed no bleed.  The
patient was then at this point transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient was on dopamine and Neo-
Synephrine, and her blood pressure was 81/39, heart rate
120s, and was saturating 100 percent on nonrebreather.  Over
the course of her MICU stay for one night, patient was
aggressively fluid resuscitated with 2-3 liters of normal
saline and her pressors were weaned to off.  She was
continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin,
levofloxacin for a question of urinary tract infection and
sepsis.  She also received 1 unit of packed red blood cells
for a hematocrit of 26.

She was continued on empiric stress-dosed steroids of 100 mg
of IV hydrocortisone q.8. for question of adrenal
insufficiency.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] stim test was not checked since the
patient had received Solu-Medrol at an outside hospital.

Since patient's blood pressure was stable and she had no
acute ICU issues, patient was transferred to Medicine floor
on [**5-2**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypercholesterolemia.
2. Myelodysplastic syndrome being managed by patient's
   outpatient oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
3. Bilateral adrenal masses recently diagnosed on [**4-28**] at
   [**Hospital **] Hospital.  Biopsy results from the adrenal
   glands revealed a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm
   with vague epithelioid features, although no pigment is
   identified, the prominent nucleoli suggested the
   possibility of malignant melanoma, however, a germ cell
   neoplasm or large cell lymphoma could not be excluded.
   Additional immunohistochemistry stains were sent and are
   still pending at the time of this dictation, and will not
   be available for at least a week.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Neupogen 300 mg subQ q.d.
3. Vancomycin and levofloxacin started at outside hospital.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives alone in [**Hospital1 392**], but prior to
her transfer here, had been living at the [**Hospital1 **] Transitional
Care Unit after her adrenal gland biopsy.  Patient has a
daughter and son, who are active in her care.  Her daughter's
name is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 101677**] and is her
healthcare proxy.  [**Name (NI) **] also has a sister and son, who are
close to her.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient is afebrile, blood pressure
81/39, heart rate 120, saturating 100 percent on
nonrebreather.  In general, she was comfortable in no
distress.  HEENT exam:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive
to light, extraocular movements are intact, mucous membranes
were dry.  Neck:  Supple, nontender, no increase in JVD.
Lungs:  Crackles at the bases left greater than right.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic with normal S1 and S2 and a 2/6
systolic murmur at the apex.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and
nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
edema.  Two plus dorsalis pedis pulses present bilaterally.
Neurologic is alert and oriented times three and moves all
extremities with no focal deficits.

LABS AT OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White blood cell count was 5.9,
hematocrit was 28.3, platelets were 58, which appears to be
the patient's baseline.  Sodium 130, potassium 4.0, chloride
93, bicarb 25, BUN 20, creatinine 1.5, previously 3.1 on [**4-18**], glucose 110.  Calcium 8.3.  CK 20 and troponin negative
per outside hospital Emergency Department.  Urinalysis showed
small bilirubin, trace ketones, large blood, 30 protein,
negative nitrite, moderate leukocyte esterase, 25-30 white
cells, [**9-29**] red cells, 2 plus bacteria, and moderate
epithelials.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates
increased consistent with [**2129-4-18**].

Chest and abdominal CT on [**4-19**] showed bilateral calcified
pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos exposure,
calcified mitral annulus, large adrenal masses 7.5 cm on the
left and 6 cm on the right consistent with metastases,
enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, largest was 2.5 cm on
the right and 2 cm on the left and multiple colonic
diverticula.

EKG at the outside hospital was sinus tachycardic at 150
beats per minute, 0.5-[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in I and aVL, left
axis deviation, no Q waves.

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 83-year-old female with recent acute
renal failure and a new diagnosis of bilateral adrenal
masses, who presents with fever and tachycardia and
hypotension.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypotension:  Patient's hypotension was thought to be most
   likely due to early sepsis most probably from a urinary
   tract infection given her fever and positive urinalysis.
   Even though patient was diuresed at the outside hospital,
   it is most likely that she was hypovolemic, which would be
   explained by her tachycardia and hypotension.  Since she
   did not receive adequate fluid resuscitation at the
   outside hospital, the patient was aggressively fluid
   resuscitated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with as
   much as 3 liters of IV fluids and blood pressure
   stabilized in the systolics of 90s to low 100s.  Patient's
   pressors were weaned to off in the Medical Intensive Care
   Unit as mentioned in the history of present illness, and
   her O2 saturations remained stable at 100 percent on 2
   liters nasal cannula.

Upon transfer to the medicine floor, patient's cultures
remained negative from blood and urine.  Patient is continued
on levofloxacin and the vancomycin was discontinued since
there was no obvious indication for continuing vancomycin.
Given the patient's septic picture, would recommend a 10 day
course total for levofloxacin.  Patient will need five more
days of levofloxacin to complete the 10 day course.
Patient's blood pressures upon discharge had been in the low
100s, which most probably is the patient's baseline blood
pressure, and she has been hemodynamically stable.  There is
question of whether her hypotension may have been secondary
to adrenal insufficiency, and this will be addressed below.

1. Oxygen requirement:  The patient had an oxygen requirement
   through most of her hospitalization, although upon
   discharge, her O2 saturatio
