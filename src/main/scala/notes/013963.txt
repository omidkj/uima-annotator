HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 43-year-old man, with a
significant past medical history for IV drug use, who has had
fever and shortness of breath for 1-2 weeks.  He received a
course of Zithromax at an outside hospital for presumed
pneumonia with no relief.  Chest x-ray done by primary care
showed with ?evidence of emboli.  CT of the chest with
evidence of bilateral pulmonary lesions.  Admitted to outside
hospital and noted to have a diastolic murmur.  An echo at
that time revealed 4+ aortic insufficiency with a 2 cm
vegetation on his tricuspid valve, and a 1 cm vegetation on
the aortic valve.  Systolic PA pressure was 70 mmHg.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 26168**] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further
evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Degenerative joint disease.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDS AT HOME:  Methadone 37 mg q am.

MEDS ON TRANSFER:
1. Vancomycin 1 gm IV bid.
2. Gentamicin 100 mg IV x 1 dose.
3. Methadone 37 mg qd.
4. Tylenol 1 gm po q 6 h prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  IV drug use, heroin.  The patient reports
his last use was up to 2 years ago.  Family unaware of his
history of abuse.  He was started on methadone in [**2115-2-22**].
Positive ETOH--6 beers per day.  Positive tobacco--25 pack
years.  He is currently married and lives at home with his
wife.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.6, heart rate
90-100, blood pressure 112/60, respiratory rate 24, O2 sat
95% on room air.
GENERAL:  The patient is diaphoretic and tachypneic.
HEENT:  Anicteric.  No conjunctival petechiae.  Pupils are
equally round and reactive to light.
NECK:  No JVD with 3+ carotid pulses.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Tachycardic with a diastolic murmur.
LUNGS:  Diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Coarse rhonchi throughout.
ABDOMEN:  Rigid but nontender.  Liver 4 cm below the costal
margin.
EXTREMITIES:  Positive [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions.  No ulcer or splinter
hemorrhages.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x 3, but somewhat confused
and unable to fully answer all questions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
service.  The cardiology service and infectious disease
services were consulted upon admission.  The patient
underwent a full medical work-up, including a CT of his
chest, his head, and his abdomen.  Additionally, the patient
was seen by the cardiology service, the infectious disease
service, the ophthalmology service, and the dental service,
as well as cardiac surgery, and the orthopedic service for an
effusion of the knee.  His blood cultures showed Staph
aureus, and his antibiotics were adjusted accordingly.

On the [**2-8**], the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization, as recommended by CT surgery, to evaluate
any coronary disease.  Please see cath report for full
details.  In summary, the cath showed that he had minimal
plaquing and mild luminal irregularities with no
flow-limiting stenoses.  The patient also had a
transesophageal echocardiogram which showed a tricuspid valve
vegetation of 2.3 x 1 cm attached to the septal leaflet, at
least mild TR, and aortic valve vegetation 1.4 x 0.4 cm, with
severe AR, and a question of flail segment with no abscesses.
No vegetations on the mitral valve and multiple jets of
mitral regurgitation.  No pulmonic valve vegetations, and
normal LV.  CT of his head at that time showed multiple
embolic brain infarcts, and the neurology service was also
consulted at that time.

The patient was accepted for aortic valve replacement, and on
[**2-9**], he was brought to the operating room where he
underwent an aortic valve replacement.  Please see the OR
report for full details.  In summary, the patient had an
aortic valve replacement with a #23 CE pericardial valve, and
resection of the tricuspid valve vegetation.  His bypass time
was 118 minutes with a crossclamp time of 80 minutes.  He
tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the
operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At
the time of transfer, the patient's mean arterial pressure
was 70 with a CVP of 11.  He was in a sinus rhythm at 95
beats per minute.  He had Levophed at 0.13 mcg/kg/min, and
propofol at 10 mcg/kg/min.  The patient did well in the
immediate postoperative period.  His anesthesia was reversed.
He was weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated.

On postoperative day #1, he remained hemodynamically stable
with Nitroglycerin infusion to control his blood pressure.
He was continued on his antibiotic courses which, at that
time, included clindamycin, gentamicin, oxacillin and
vancomycin.  During the course of postoperative day #1, the
patient was begun on diuretics, as well as beta blockers, and
his chest tubes were discontinued.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable, and on postoperative day #2, he was
weaned from his IV Nitroglycerin and begun on Norvasc for
blood pressure control.  Additionally, the patient had a PICC
line placed, and was seen by the orthopedic team for
evaluation of his left knee effusion that had grown Staph
aureus from an aspiration done earlier prior to his surgery.
The knee was again aspirated and sent for Gram stain and
culture.

On postoperative day #3, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was begun on ACE inhibitors and transferred to
the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac
rehabilitation.  Throughout this period, the patient
continued to be followed by the infectious disease service.

On postoperative day #4, the patient remained stable.  His
temporary pacing wires were removed, and he was scheduled for
a left knee arthroscopy by the Orthopedic Department.  On day
#5, the patient underwent an arthroscopy and a washout.  He
continued to progress from inactivity and a cardiac surgery
standpoint.  However, he did continue to have low-grade
fevers with a mildly elevated white blood cell count
throughout this period.  Over the next week, the patient's
white blood cell count continued to normalize.  He continued
to have low-grade fevers which were felt to be a result of
splenic, pulmonary and cerebral infarcts.  He continued on
his clindamycin and oxacillin as recommended by the ID team.
His activity level was increased with the assistance of the
nursing staff and the physical therapy staff.  He had a
repeat head CT which showed no change from his previous head
CT.

On postoperative day #12, it was decided that the following
day the patient would be stable and ready for discharge to
home.  On postoperative day #13, arrangements were made for
the patient to be followed for outpatient services to
maintain antibiotic course throughout [**3-24**], and on
postoperative day #14, the patient was discharged to home.
