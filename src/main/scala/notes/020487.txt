Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**10-7**]:  Left femoral neck fracture status post percutaneous
fixation with 7.3 mm screws of nondisplaced valgus impacted
femoral neck fracture.


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a past medical history of CVA
on coumadin and seizure disorder presenting from OSH for recent
diagnosis of left non-displaced femoral neck fracture with
hypoxemia and moderately sized right sided pleural effusions. Ms
[**Known lastname 16254**] was in her usual state of health last week when she got up
from her sofa and bumped into a coffee table and fell. She had
no presyncopal symptoms, no fevers, no chest pain or shortness
of breath surrounding the event; no loss of consciousness. After
her fall, she crawled to the phone and called EMS. Other than
pain, she had no significant other symptoms. At the OSH, she was
imaged with a CT spine, CT chest, and CT pelvis. Pelvic imaging
revealed a left femoral neck fracture, non-displaced. CT chest
revealed a moderately sized left sided and small right sided
pleural effusions. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management when these effusions were detected. In the ED at
[**Hospital1 18**], radiology reviewed these films and felt they were
consistent with pleural effusions not hemothorax. She did have
hypoxemia with O2 sats in the high 80s; she was placed on a
non-rebreather with improvement to the high 90s. She did not
endorse significant dyspnea or chest pain. EKG demonstrated
T-wave inversions in inferior leads; a single set of cardiac
enzymes were negative. She received ceftriaxone and azithromycin
given her pleural effusions and fentanyl for her hip pain.
Orthopedics evaluated her and felt her to be an operative
candidate for hemiarthroplasty. Her health care proxy, her son
[**Name (NI) **], declined consent for any surgery and he stated he would
reconsider in the morning after discussing her status with the
attending. At time of transfer to the MICU, she was in mild hip
pain but with no other complaints. She was weaned to 4 L NC with
O2 sats between 97-100, with HRs in the 80s, BPs 120s, and was
afebrile.
.
She has otherwise been healthy other than her chronic seizure
disorder and coumadin therapy for her CVA. She has good exercise
tolerance frequently climbing her [**7-8**] stairs to get to the
[**Location (un) 1773**] of her house without significant dyspnea or
fatigue.


Past Medical History:
1. seizure disorder (unclear what type, apparently has had for
several decades)
2. CVA X 2 (unclear what type) dating back a couple of decades
3. hypertension
4. hyperlipidemia
5. paroxysmal afib


Social History:
Lives at home by herself in [**Location (un) 14840**], MA; her son, [**Name (NI) **], who
lives at [**Location (un) **] visits her frequently and helps with
groceries, maintenance of house, otherwise she does most of her
ADLs and is very active at home. Denies smoking, alcohol use.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:

Gen: Sitting up in bed in NAD
Neuro: Alert, cannot tell us year and identifies hospital as
"[**Location (un) **]," however she is able to give us a detailed history of
her fall and converses brightly and intelligently. Moving all
extremities; lower extremity exam limited by pain.
Cardiac: Systolic ejection murmur loudest at left lower sternal
border grade III/VI
Pulm: moderate dullness to percussion over left lung base,
mildly diminished breath sounds at left and right lung base,
exam somewhat limited by inability to sit up secondary to hip
pain
Abd: very soft and nontender, normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: Limited secondary to hip pain, no edema noted

III. Radiology

A. Video Swallow ([**2190-10-13**])
INDICATION: Coughing with meals, dysphagia, history of
esophageal dilatation.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: The study was conducted in
collaboration with
speech pathology. Various consistencies of barium were
administered by mouth including thin, nectar, puree, and ground.
There is a solitary incidence of penetration into the vestibule
with thin consistency. There is no aspiration into the airway.
There is a small amount of nasal regurgitation with thin
consistency. There is a small amount of residue with nectar
consistency.  There is a moderate amount of residue with puree
consistency. This clears with subsequent swallows.

IMPRESSION: No aspiration seen.

B. CXR ([**2190-10-12**])
HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with respiratory difficulty and
altered mental
status.

COMPARISON: [**2190-10-7**].

SINGLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 9:15 A.M.: There has been an
increase in size of a layering right pleural effusion, now
moderate, and development of a new left pleural effusion, small.
Bilateral retrocardiac opacities are compatible with associated
compressive atelectasis. There is good aeration of the upper
lungs, without consolidation or pneumothorax. Parenchymal
opacities, particularly in the left upper lung have improved.
There is no new hilar or mediastinal enlargement. Pulmonary
vascularity is near normal in caliber. Aortic arch
calcifications are noted. Degenerative changes are present in
the spine.

A surgical clip at the thoracic inlet is compatible with prior
thyroid
surgery.

IMPRESSION:

Increased pleural effusions (moderate on the right and small on
the left), in combination with improved aeration of the upper
lungs is compatible with improving pulmonary edema.

C. MRI Brain ([**2190-10-11**])
EXAM: MRI of the brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of CVA with left
non-displaced
femoral head fracture, has hypoxia and right-sided pleural
effusion, for
further evaluation to exclude intracranial abnormality.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2, susceptibility and
diffusion axial
images of the brain were acquired.

FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute
infarct. There
is a chronic infarc
