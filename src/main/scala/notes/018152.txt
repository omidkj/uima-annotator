Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure in the setting of intraparenchymal hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
* Pt arrived intubated

History of Present Illness:
PER ADMITTING RESIDENT:
The patient is a 67 year old woman with a history of AI s/p
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1291**] on Coumadin, hypertension, and ESRD on HD qMWF who presents
with left arm weakness since 9:30 am today ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital
records) vs. intermittent episodes of rhythmic left arm
twitching
and preserved consciousness since 3:45 pm today (per her
daughters) who was found to have a right posterior frontal
parenchymal hemorrhage at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction with
subarachnoid spread in the setting of INR to 2.9. The patient is
accompanied by her daughters [**Name (NI) 12335**] and [**Name (NI) 1494**].

Per the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital notes, the patient started having left
arm weakness at 9:30 am today. However, per the patient's
daughters, the patient had HD at 9:30 am today. She then called
her daugther at 3:45 pm as she was having rhythmic twitching of
her left arm. This would occur intermittently and last 5 minutes
at a time. She had preserved consciousness during the episodes
with no tongue biting or loss or bowel/bladder function. At that
time she had no twitching in her left leg or her entire right
side. She does not have a history of seizures. Her daughters did
not notice any left sided weakness at 3:45 today. She has not
had
recent headache or head trauma, and has not had fevers/chills,
coughs/colds, or diarrhea. Her daughters say she has not been
feeling well for the past 2 weeks.

She was initially taken to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital where vitals were
afebrile, bp 161/83, HR 110, RR 16, SaO2 98% on RA. Exam showed
alert and oriented x3, tachycardia, left arm flaccid with no
reflexes noted, twitching in distal arm, lower extremities
within
normal limits. Labs showed INR 2.9, PTT 37.3, WBC 11.6 (90%
neutrophils), Hct 32.8, plt 241, Na 143, K 4.2, Cl 97, CO2 33,
BUN 32, Cr 8.1, glucose 103, Ca [**69**].1, AST 18, ALT 12, alk phos
144. Head CT showed a right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage
with subarachnoid extension, and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for
further evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her INR was 3.1 on admission, and she was given
Vitamin K 10 mg IV x1 and ordered for 2 U FFP. Per the ED
attending she had a flaccid left arm on admission but was moving
her left leg, coherent, speech clear, and no facial droop. While
in the ED, she again had rhythmic twitching of her left hand AND
foot, but was able to talk through it. This lasted for 5
minutes,
and stopped after she received Ativan 2 mg IV x1. She was also
given Labetalol 20 mg IV x1 for blood pressure. Repeat head CT
showed stable exam with 2.4 x 2.5 cm right posterior frontal
parenchymal hemorrhage at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter junction with surrounding edema and extension of
hemorrhage to
the subarachnoid space with linear hyperdense blood within the
right central sulcus. She was evaluated by Neurosurgery who did
not think this was a surgical hemorrhage. Neurology was
initially
consulted for management of her seizure.

Hypertension
GERD
C. diff colitis
Asthma
Migraines
Staph epidermidis bacteremia
.
She has no history of hyperlipidemia or DM


Social History:
She lives with her daughter [**Name (NI) 12335**]. She is a
retired lab assistant at the Red Cross.
HABITS
She quit smoking cigarettes >30 years ago, denies EtOH use. Her
daughter tells me she smokes marijuana daily, but denies cocaine
use.


Family History:
Her daughter has depression and her son has
schizophrenia and is deaf.


Physical Exam:
ON ADMISSION:
VS: temp 99.3, HR 100, RR 36, bp 150/64, SaO2 99%
During the exam, her blood pressure drops to SBP 93 in the
setting of receiving Dilantin, so she is layed flat in the bed
and the Dilantin is slowed down.
Genl: Awake, but very sleepy, yawning frequently during the exam
HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival injection
CV: Tachycardic, Nl S1, mechanical S2, II/VI systolic murmur
best
at LUSB, no rubs or gallops
Chest: CTA bilaterally anteriorly, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake but sleepy, arouses to sternal rub and
voice, uncooperative with exam. Prefers to keep her eyes closed.
Oriented to person, but says place is [**Hospital1 756**] and date is [**2168-4-6**]. Speech is nonfluent, naming intact to glove and chair but
does not name the other objects on the left side of the stroke
scale card. Dysarthric. Probable left sided neglect.

Cranial Nerves: Left pupil 5->3 mm, right pupil 3->2 mm. Does
not
comply with EOMI testing. Left UMN facial droop. Tongue midline.


Motor/Sensation: Decreased tone in her left arm and leg. No
observed myoclonus, asterixis, or tremor. Left arm flaccid and
does not move it at all against gravity. She does not move her
arm to noxious stimulus (nailbed pressure). She is able to keep
her right arm against gravity and provides full 5 resistance at
the right triceps but is not cooperative with the other muscle
groups. She does not move her left leg against gravity, and
triple flexes her left leg to noxious stimulus (nailbed
pressure). She keeps her right leg against gravity, but does not
cooperate with formal muscle strength testing.

Reflexes: Trace left biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps
reflexes, 1+ right biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps
reflexes.
Reflexes 0 and symmetric in knees and ankles. Toes upgoing
bilaterally.

IMAGING:

CT Head without Contrast ([**2168-11-16**]):
IMPRESSION: Stable exam with right posterior frontal lobe
parenchymal
hemorrhage with associated subarachnoid hemorhage.
.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2168-11-16**]):
IMPRESSION: Interval enlargement of right frontal intracranial
hemorrhage
with subarachnoid extension with surroudning edema; likely
ongoing
hemorrhage.
.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2168-11-17**]):
IMPRESSION: 4.5x4.7cm Right frontal lobe intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with
subarachnoid extension, slightly smaller in the AP dimension
likely due to
expected evolution; persistent surrounding edema unchanged.
Underlying
vascular or neoplastic causes cannot be exlcuded. Further
evaluation after
resolution of the hemorrhage is recommended to exclude the same.

.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ([**2168-11-17**]):
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen, although cannot be
reliably excluded on the aortic prosthesis. Moderate to severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 30%), c/w
extensive prior inferior myocardial infarction. At least mild
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

MRI/A/V of the head [**11-25**]:

There is a large area of acute hemorrhage identified in the
right parietal and
posterior frontal region with surrounding edema and mass effect
on the lateral
ventricle. There is no midline shift seen. The area of
hemorrhage measures
approximately 6 x 5 cm. Additional small area of fluid-fluid
level measuring
approximately 2 cm is seen adjacent to the atrium of the right
lateral
ventricle. There is no additional surrounding area of restricted
diffusion
identified. A tiny area of high signal within the left posterior
parietal
convexity subcortical region on diffusion images appears to be
secondary to T2
shine-through. There is increased s
