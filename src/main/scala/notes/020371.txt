Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
85 yo F with HTN, polymyalgia rheumatica, transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Location (un) 620**] for cardiac catheterization. The patient was in her
usual state of health until Wednesday [**2-11**], when she developed
black diarrhea, occuring 5 times daily. The patient attributes
the black color to her iron supplements. Along with diarrhea,
the patient also experienced 2 episodes of vomiting (clear, no
blood or coffee grounds). The patient also had fever to as high
as 100.6 on Friday [**2-13**] and Saturday [**2-14**].

On Sunday [**2-15**], the patient became lightheaded when getting up
from the toilet and fell, hitting her head and right elbow. She
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], where head and c-spine CT were
negative. She developed chest pain after admission, relieved
with metoprolol and nitroglycerin. She received 1 unit of RBCs
for Hct 27, and became short of breath. She was given 40mg IV
lasix and diuresed 500cc. She ruled in for MI with third set of
troponins peaking at 0.26. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization on 100% non-rebreather and a heparin
gtt. Of note, pt was guaiac positive on admission.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was taken to the cardiac
catherization lab, where she was found to have severe 3-vessel
disease and an elevated LVEDP (see below for details). She was
transferred to the CCU on a non-rebreather for further
management. In the CCU, the patient was weaned to a
non-rebreather. She reported that her breathing was improved and
had no other complaints.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough,
hemoptysis, or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. She denies
sore throat, sinus congestion, dysuria. She denies weakness,
tingling, or numbness. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain and
lightheadedness as above and two pillow orthopnea. No syncope.
The patient reports a recent decrease in exercise tolerance from
100 feet on a flat surface to 50 feet on a flat surface.

CXR ([**2161-2-18**]) - The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the
upper range of normal, there is no evidence for overt pulmonary
edema. In the right upper lobe as well as in the entire left
lung, the interstitial markings are increased, there are patchy
areas of opacities, that are ill-defined and distributed in a
mainly peribronchial pattern. In addition, a small left basilar
atelectasis and a small left pleural effusion is seen. Overall,
the morphology and distribution of the changes suggests
multifocal pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema. No evidence of
right basal changes, no evidence of right-sided pleural
effusion.

CXR ([**2161-2-20**]) - In comparison with study of [**2-18**], there has been
placement of left subclavian PICC line extends to the mid
portion of the SVC. There has been some decrease in the
bilateral patchy areas of opacification, most likely consistent
with improving pneumonia.

Cardiac Cath ([**2161-2-16**]) -
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated severe three vessel CAD. The LCx was the least
stenosed and there was no obvious single culprit stenosis. The
LMCA had distal calcification with a hazy 30% stenosis. The LAD
was heavily calcified with diffuse disease throughout with
serial 60% stenoses just before a major D4 with a distal 85%
stenosis and an 80% apical stenosis. There was a high D1,
functionally a large septal branch which was patent. A large D2
and D4 were also patent. The LCx was tortuous proximally with
slow flow and mild diffuse disease in the AV groove LCx. OM
branch had a proximal 50% stenosis with a tortuous upper pole
and mild diffuse disease in the lower pole. The distal AV groove
LCx supplied collaterals to the distal RCA system. The RCA was
heavily calcified with a 40% ostial stenosis without pressure
dampening. There was proximal diffuse disease up to 75% and
distal diffuse disease before the RPDA up to 45%.  There was
moderate diffuse disease throughout the RPDA with severe diffuse
disease in the distal AV groove RCA supplying the RPLs with slow
flow (? severe disease vs. competitive flow from collaterals).
Septal collaterals from the LAD fill the RPDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated RA
pressure
with a mean RAP of 9 mmHg. There was severely elevated left
sided filling pressures with an LVEDP of 29 mmHg. There was
moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of
160 mmHg. No cardiac index could be calculated as unable to
float PWP catheter beyond RA.
3. Modest hypoxemia (O2 sat 93% on 15L NRB mask) improved to 96%
with the addition of 2L via nasal cannula arguing against
significant shunt physiology.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel CAD.
2. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo F with HTN, Afib, dCHF, CKD, h/o guaiac-positive stools,
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for cardiac catheterization in the
setting of elevated cardiac enzymes, new focal wall motion
abnormalities, and worsened MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] to have extensive 3-vessel
disease.

# Coronary Artery Disease: Pt noted to have a troponin leak at
an OSH, with peak of 0.26. Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheter
