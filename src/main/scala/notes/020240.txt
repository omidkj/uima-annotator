Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 78 yoM w/ a h/o CAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia and COPD who
presents with subacute DOE x 2 months and acute SOB x 1 (+ PND
and DOE w/ minimal exertion- walking to bathroom). His initial
Dyspnea on exertion while on oxygen: able to walk 500ft prior to
becoming dyspneic. His acute SOB was an episode of PND followed
by confusion and DOE upon minimal exertion later in the day with
associated confusion, he had an O2 sat at that time of 71% on 2L
NC checked at home, when in the ambulance O2 sat increased w/
higher level of supplemental oxygen and he no longer felt
confused. He recently ([**4-20**]) had seen his pulmonologist at NEBH
who had started him on home O2 for emphysema, started at 2
liters NC and increased to 4L NC while ambulating or sleeping.
He denies any chest pain at rest or with exertion. Denies
orthopnea, + PND a.m. of admission, resolved with sitting up and
taking 4 deep breaths and symptoms began to improve. + chills x
1 day on day prior to admission, + dry cough. Per patient weight
in [**10-19**] was 222 lbs. + bilateral lower extremity edema L > R x
2 months. Does state he does not always follow a strict low salt
diet but does take his medications.
.
Of note the patient underwent a recent cardiac cath at NEBH on
[**2151-7-8**] for dypsnea on exertion and a nuclear stress test with
anteroapical and inferior ischemia- found to have no significant
CAD, normal EF, and wedge elevated to 37mmHg with mod pulm HTN.
.
MICU COURSE: O2 initially on CPAP, then face mask at 80% FiO2,
now on 5L after treatment initiated for COPD and diuresis for
CHF.
.
Currently, feels well, no SOB, no chest pain. No orthopnea but
likes sleeping on 2 pillows.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 78yoM h/o CAD s/p ostial RCA
stent in [**12-19**] with extensive smoking hisotry who presented with
subacute worsening of dyspnea on exertion x 2 months with acute
shortness of breath, now improving with treatment of CHF
(preserved EF on cath [**7-8**]) and COPD flare.
.
# SOB / Hypoxia: clinical exam consistent with pulmonary edema
with small component of COPD flare. initially on 80% face mask
now on 3 L NC and sating well. Prior to admission home O2
increased to 4L NC during sleep and during ambulation. Patient
has a mildly elevated BNP to the 600s range with mild CHF on
CXR. Possible retrocardiac opacity. Symptoms and degree of
hypoxia improving with diuresis and with treatment of COPD
flare.
-possibly worsening volume overload x 2 months causing subacute
dyspnea on exertion with possible acute worsening due to dye
load on [**7-8**] at NEBH
-repeat echo demonstrates likely diastolic heart failure with EF
> 65%
-pt aggressively diuresed in the MICU and then on the floor
- seems patient likely close to his dry weight as bicarb rising
likely secondary to contraction alkalosis; will switch patient
to home dose of lasix and monitor, still with crackles on exam
-ruled out for MI
-Continue to treat COPD flare with azithromycin, prednisone
taper ended yesterday, continue albuterol nebs q4hrs standing
and tiotropium
-lower extremity dopplers negative, making PE unlikely as
etiology
-low sodium diet
-continue ASA and plavix
-continue norvasc 5mg daily
- BP remains elevated on 50 mg PO BID, will to 75 mg PO BID, and
follow HR and BP
-cont Lipitor 20mg daily
-Lisinopril 5mg daily which was added this admission, can also
consider uptitration of this for HTN control as well
-wean O2 with goal sat 90-92% on 2L
#) Pt with non-stained VT on initial admission EKG
- placed on telemetry for > 24 hours on the floor, without acute
event
- d/ced tele as low suspicion for arrythmia
.
# DM2- cover w/SSI
-start lantus 8u qhs [**7-11**] and uptitrate to lantus to 10 Units at
bedtime, AM FS improved
- monitor closely during steroid taper.
-hold home glipizide and metformin, but d/c patient with these
meds again
