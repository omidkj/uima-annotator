History of Present Illness:
66 year old female
with multiple co-morbidities and severe multivessel coronary
artery disease, who was recently found to have
tracheobronchomalacia and excessive dynamic airway collapse.
Prior to surgical revascularization, she will undergo central
airway stabilization. She currently complains of exertional
chest
pain and dyspnea on exertion. She admits to [**2-6**] pillow orthopnea
and worsening fatigue. Her routine ADLs are moderately to
severely limited by the above symptoms. Of note, she has had
multiple hospitalizations for "asthma", receiving repeat courses
of antibiotics and steroids. She is currently taking neither.
Referred for surgical evaluation.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**1-5**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. The
patient is in a ventricularly paced rhythm. The patient has runs
of a supraventricular tachycardia. Frequent atrial premature
beats. Frequent ventricular premature beats.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
IMPRESSIONS:
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild-moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS:
Pt is on a low dose phenylephrine infusion (<0.3 mcg/kg/min) and
is normal sinus rhythm (not being paced).
Preserved biventricular systolic function without wall motion
abnormalities.
Mild aortic regurgitation and mild-moderate mitral regurgation
persist.
Normal aortic contours.

The surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was notified of the findings in person.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**7-24**] and underwent tracheal stenting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
CABG with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please refer to Dr[**Doctor Last Name **] operative report for
further details. Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on
titrated phenylephrine and propofol drips. Bedside bronchoscopy
done [**7-25**]. Chest tubes removed on [**7-26**]. Extubated on POD #4.
Developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was started on
amiodarone and lopressor titrated.  Continued to improve and was
transferred to the floor on POD #10. Physical therapy was
consulted for strength and mobility evaluation. She had
persistent fevers and leukocytosis.  Urine culture revealed
100,000/mL colonies of enterococcus, and sputum grew coag+
staph.  She was placed on vancomycin and bactrim. Per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **],
upon discharge to rehab, antibiotics are to be changed to oral
Levoquin x 2 week course
