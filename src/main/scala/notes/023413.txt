History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 72 y/o male w/ h/o HBV s/p right hepatectomy for
HCC on [**2138-11-7**] discharged from hospital [**2138-10-24**] now
complaining of severe abdominal pain and dizziness. When
discharged from the hospital, pain was well-controlled on
oxycodone and acetominophen, he was tolerating a regular diet,
and vital signs
were stable. The evening following discharge, he noted
increasing pain, worse in epigastrum/RUQ. There were no
exacerbating or mitigating factors to pain. Pain was accompanied
by nausea without vomiting, febrile symptoms with temperature to
100, and dizziness. Pain became unbearable by 2AM, interfering
with sleep, at which point he called the hepatobiliary clinic
number and was
scheduled for an appointment for today ([**11-25**]). In clinic, was
noted to be diffusely tender on exam, tachycardic to 110s, and
hypotensive to 80s/50s. Patient was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
evaluation. Patient endorses worsening abdominal pain, nausea,
shortness of breath, blurry vision, fever and chills, and
myalgias. Noted pedal edema has worsened despite taking
diuretics. Patient denies vomiting, melena, hematochezia, chest
pain, and change in bowel habits. Appetite is poor, consuming
only soup for dinner and water in AM.

Pertinent Results:
[**2138-11-25**] CT abd/pelvis: 1. Right-sided moderate pleural
effusion, left trace pleural effusion, new since [**2138-10-10**].
2. 10 x 8 x 11 cm homogenous fluid collection in the sugical
resection bed with mass effect on remnant left hepatic lobe is
noted.  3. Ascites.

[**2138-11-25**] U/S abd: no protal vein thrombosis. Technically
successful ultrasound-guided aspiration of 650 cc of cloudy
[**Location (un) 2452**]-yellow fluid from a perihepatic collection and placement
of an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] drainage catheter.

[**2138-12-7**] U/S: 1. Status post right hepatectomy with large
complex fluid collection in the post-surgical bed measuring up
to 8.8 cm in size. This is likely unchanged in size given
differences in imaging technique since [**2138-11-25**]. 2.
Patent hepatic and portal veins and hepatic arteries with
appropriate waveforms. 3. Moderate-sized right pleural effusion
as seen before.

[**2138-12-8**] EGD: Old blood was seen in the esophagus. there were no
esophageal varices. Blood in the stomach. Blood in the second
part of the duodenum, possibly from the ampulla.

[**2138-12-8**]: celiac angiogram: subtle areas of abnormality in the
artery supplying peripheral branches of the right side of liver.
In addition, a small area of contrast blush was noted arising
from the gastroduodenal artery in the region of the duodenal
bulb. 1. Successful particle embolization of abnormal right
hepatic artery branch. 2. Successful coil and Gelfoam
embolization of active extravasation noted from a branch of the
gastroduodenal artery.

[**2138-12-11**] celiac angio: embolization of right hepatic artery
(pending)

[**2138-12-11**] EGD: A large opening was seen at the level of the
ampulla, lateral to the lumen and of the same diameter. This was
consistent with either a very large diverticulum or a large
ulcer crater (less likely). The tissue in this
crater/diverticulum was ulcerated and slightly necrotic, c/w
recent embolization. It was not actively bleeding. The ampula
was seen adjascent to this opening at the lumen wall (in the
duodenum). There was active hemorrhage seen from the ampula of
bright red blood.

[**2138-12-12**] EGD: Blood in the lower third of the esophagus. Blood in
the stomach.Blood in the duodenum. A large diverticulum was seen
at the level of the ampulla. This was seen and described on his
prior EGD, and likely represents a large diverticulum. There was
dark blood in the diverticulum as well as diffuse, surrounding
erosions and scar c/w recent embolization. There was no active
bleeding coming from this area.

[**2138-12-12**] CT abd/pelvis: 1. Bilateral pleural effusions with
adjacent compressive atelectasis; left is new since [**2138-11-25**].
2. Homogenous fluid collection in surgical bed of right
hepatectomy decreased in size with no focal hypodensities of
concern. 3. Increased intraperitoneal fluid with slight increase
in density compared to [**11-25**] study may represent increased
proteinaceous component or component of hemoperitoneum. 4. No
retroperitoneal fluid noted.  5. Retention of renal contrast
within cortex of bilateral kidneys concerning for ATN.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was evaluated in the ED on [**2138-11-25**] and started
empirically on vancomycin and Zosyn. At this time WBC was 21.1,
Tbili was 11.0, lactate was 10.2, and creatinine was 2.8.
Patient underwent ultrasound-guided drain placement with
drainage of 650 cc of peritoneal fluid, which revealed [**Numeric Identifier 87932**]
WBCs and rare ESBL E Coli, consistent with secondary
peritonitis. He was transferred to the SICU and blood pressure
was stabilized by 1.5 L fluid boluses. On [**11-26**] patient was
stable and was transferred to the floor with improved pain. On
[**11-28**] vancomycin was discontinued, while Zosyn was continued due
to final culture results.

On [**11-30**], platelets were 46 from 61 on [**11-29**] and 66 on [**11-28**].
Consequently, a HIT panel was sent and Zosyn was changed to
Meropenem due to its association with thrombocytopenia. The HIT
antibody was positive, pending serotonin release assay results,
and [**Location (un) 2274**] Hematology was consulted, who recommended initiation of
bivalrudin given association of HIT with thrombotic events. In
order to transition to oral anticoagulation warfarin was started
at 2.5 mg on [**12-3**]. INR was 2.7 on [**12-3**] and
2.2 on [**12-4**], on which patient also received 2.5 mg warfarin. On
[**12-5**] bivalrudin was discontinued in the morning. INR was
measured at 7.7 and rechecked at 10.5 and 9.4, and
anticoagulation was held. Serotonin release assay returned
negative for HIT. Patient complained of diffuse abdominal pain,
but hematocrit was stable at 30-32 and patient was
hemodynamically stable. 2u FFP were given with a decrease in INR
to 2.5 and vitamin K was administered.

On [**12-6**] patient was found to be dizzy and hypotensive with
melanotic stool. INR was 10.5 and HCT declined to 24.5. Patient
was transferred to the ICU, where he received IVF and blood
products and was started on a PPI drip. By [**12-7**] melanotic
stools stopped and patient was hemodynamically stable and
patient was transferred to the floor overnight. The morning of
[**12-8**] melena resumed, with a drop
