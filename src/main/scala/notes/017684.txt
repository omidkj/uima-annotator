Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 81 yo female with progressive painless jaundice
over the past two weeks now presenting with hypotension and
hypothermia likely representing sepsis.

Patient initially presented with hypotension, tachycardia and
leukocytosis of 12,000 with bandemia. Pressures initially
improved with NS boluses though MAPs remained in the mid-50's.
Initial infectious sources that were considered included
urosepsis especially given urine cx positive for ESBL E.Coli and
Cholangitis given cholestatic picture. Chest x-ray also
demonstrated patchy opacities in the left mid-lung which
concerning for possible pnuemonia. Patient was initially started
on Meropenem, Flagyl and Vancomycin. Central venous and arterial
access was also obtained and patient was intubated. She was also
started on pressors to maintain MAPS > 65.

CT abdomen and US were performed to evaluate for CBD dilitation
which were negative.  Sputum cultures were obtained which were
possitive for MRSA and urine cultures were obtained which were
possitive for E.Coli and Enterococcus. Initial labs showed a
large transaminitis with elevated AP and TB. ERCP was consulted
who recommended ERCP vs. MRCP to evaluate for obstruction. Liver
was also consulted who felt the most likely etiology given
normal imaging was drug induced intrahepatic cholestasis with
components of shock liver vs. obstruction. They also recommended
MRCP vs. transjugular biopsy; however, patient had a pacer and
was not well enough to tolerate the biopsy. Hepatitis serologies
were checked and were negative. Transaminases trended down
throughout her stay while AP and TB remained elevated.

Patient began to experience atrial fibrillation with RVR to the
150's which was somewhat controlled after loading with digoxin.
Patient also began to experience anuric renal failure with
diffuse anasarca. Renal was consulted regarding possibility of
CVVH vs. HD; however, after discussion with family, this was not
consistent with her long term goals of care and thus deferred. A
TTE was performed which showed an LVEF of 30-35%. Wound care was
consulted and recommended continuing adequate skin moisturizer
to prevent tissue breakdown.

Attempts were made to wean pressors but the patient remained
pressor dependent throughout her stay. Family meetings were
routinely held discussing goals of care.  On [**10-23**] the family
agreed to no escalation of care and on [**10-24**] the family asked for
patient to be made CMO. She was extubated and all medications
were stopped.  Patient subsequently expired in the evening on
9/31.
