HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted with a
history of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma status post
supraglottic laryngectomy in [**2107**]; no chemotherapy or
radiation therapy at that time.  The patient subsequently had
a right neck mass which was a recurrence in [**2114**].  At that
time, she had chemotherapy with Cisplatin and 5FU plus
radiation therapy and had a tracheostomy done at that time in
[**2114**].  The Tracheostomy was then closed later in [**2114**].

The patient presented recently to [**Hospital 26260**] Hospital on
[**2116-4-25**], to the Emergency Department in respiratory
distress and was intubated orally with laryngoscope and much
difficulty.  CT of the neck was consistent with recurrent
disease.  There was an attempt in the Operating Room on [**2116-4-28**], to extubate with fiberoptic evaluation, which
revealed however, that she had edematous AE fold, 1-2 mm
airway, poor vocal cord abduction, and the patient had
stridors after extubation and was then reintubated at that
time and transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital
for further management.

The patient presented on [**2116-4-29**], in the evening, to
have her tracheostomy redone tomorrow.

laryngoscopy.  Findings were that of a small anterior mass,
anterior to the left vocal cord.  Biopsy was sent to
Pathology.  She was then returned to the SICU.  The patient
had her vent-trach weaned and was then transferred to the
floor on [**5-1**], which was postoperative day #1, at [**Hospital6 1760**] on postoperative day #3 from
the previous operation.

Postoperatively, the patient was kept on Vancomycin.  She had
a good cough.  The tracheostomy and the airway were patent
and well secured.  Physical Therapy helped with ambulation.
It was noted that she had right arm swelling, and she had had
a PICC line in the right arm which was then removed, and
subsequently the PICC line was placed in the left side.

On [**2116-5-4**], the patient was found to have a deep venous
thrombosis in the right upper extremity on ultrasound and was
treated with Heparin.  She was continued on Heparin, and when
she was therapeutic, she was started on Coumadin with a goal
INR around 2.0.  She also had a Hematology/Oncology consult.
A CT of the head and neck was done which did not reveal
obvious recurrent disease.  The patient also a had a right
arm elevation ...................., in addition to her
Heparin and Coumadin ..................

The Foley was discontinued successfully.  She continued to
have a good airway and patent tracheostomy.  Finally on the
17th, the INR was 2.2.  Heparin was discontinued.  The
patient was kept on Coumadin ............... and Vancomycin.
Plans were made for discharge home with services on [**5-13**].
