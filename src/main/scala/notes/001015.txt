History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 79 yo female with PMH significant for HTN, COPD who
presented to OSH with acute onset of SOB on [**2133-11-5**]. She was
C/o of mild discomfort on the sides of her upper abd after which
the SOB started suddenly. Initially she thought that she was
having a panic attack but then she became diaphoretic and cold.
Daughters called 911 and she was taken to [**Hospital3 934**]
hospital. Her initial O2 sat were 88% on 4L O2 and was afebrile.
CXR showed extensive B/l alveolar infiltrates more on the rt
side. A prelim diagnosis of CHF with COPD exacerbation was made
and she was started on morphine, lasix and solumedrol levaquin,
ceftriaxone and nebulizers. She was put on BiPaP for her resp
distress and subsequently was intubated. CTA was negative for
PE. An echo performed revealed MVP with severe MR. At the
request of the family the pt is transferred to [**Hospital3 **].

ROS: Generalized fatigue for the past few months. Cough with
blood for about 2 months. Abd gas pain. No h/o CP, palpitaions,
dizziness, syncope, orthopnea, PND or pedal edema. Daughters say
that the pt has lost significant weight in the last few months.



Past Medical History:
1)COPD predominant emphysema
2)Hypertension
3)Glaucoma
4)Cataract
5)Osteoporosis
6)Seasonal Allergies
7)Anxiety
8)Arthritis

Social History:
Lives alone. Daughter lives nearby. Very active and current
smoker with 1ppd since age 16.

ECHO [**2133-11-10**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral
valve prolapse. There is partial mitral leaflet flail. Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet
is eccentric. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Tricuspid valve prolapse is present. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears loculated. There is brief right
atrial diastolic collapse. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling.

Impression: mitral and tricuspid valve prolapse with flail
mitral leaflets; severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with
hyperdynamic left ventricular contractile function
.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is 79 y/o f with wide open MR, CHF and pnumonia. She was
admitted to the CCU.
.
1) Cardiac:
Patient was admitted to the coronary care unit for management.
Her fentanyl drip was increased to provide sedation for the
insertion of an arterial line. After the procedure the patient
developed hypotension which was subsequently reversed by
naloxone. She was later started on nipride drip for persistent
hypotension.
Pt had cardiac cath which showed normal coronaries with elevated
pressures. A decision to take the patient for mitral valve
replacement surgery was made after discussion with the family
and therefore B/l chest tubes were placed to drain the pleural
effusion post cath. Hct dropped from 26.4 to 24.6 after chest
tube insertion and the pt received 1 unit of PRBC. Later the
family reconsidered their decison and the patient's daughter who
is also the health care proxy refused surgery. With the wishes
of the family the patient was then extubated and she maintained
spontaneous ventilation. We were able to communicate with her
and she expressed that she did not want any kind of intervention
to prolong her life including ET tube, chest tube or any
surgery. Subsequently after discussion with the family the pt's
status was changed to comfort measures only and she was started
on morphine drip.
.
2) Pulmonary:
She was also started on antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin for pneumonia) and maintained on the ventilator.
She was oxygenating adequately. As noted previously she was
extubated and code status changed to CMO.
.
The patient expired on comfort measures only on Thursday evening
([**2133-11-12**]).
