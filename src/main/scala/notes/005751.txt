History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 53 y/o F with Stage IIB (T2N0M0)
adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus s/p neoadjuvant therapy
who
presents for follow up after an open J tube placement 3 weeks
ago.  Pt had J tube placed due to issues with PO intolerance and
nausea/vomiting.  Initial attempt was made at laparoscopic J
tube
placement, however the operation was converted to open due to
extensive adhesive disease requiring lysis of adhesions and
resection of a small portion of small bowel.

Pt states that she has continued to feel better everyday since
discharge, but she still continues to have intermittent episodes
of nausea and vomiting of digested food.  Initially, these
episodes would occur multiple times a day, however they now
occur
every other day.  Pt has been taking compazine for these
episodes
with minimal relief. Otherwise, pt denies abdominal pain or
diarrhea.  She is tolerating her J tube feeds.  They are running
continuously at 60 cc/hr.  Pt denies fevers.  When she is not
experiencing nausea and vomiting, she is able to tolerate soft
foods without difficulty.  Pt also had issues with
hallucinations
during her admission which have now resolved.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic history -
[**2109-9-17**] - EGD revealed a 6 cm ulcerated tumor in the lower
third
of the esophagus, following a CT of the abdomen for chronic
abdominal symptoms showing thickening of the esophagus. Biopsy
of
this lesion was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
[**2109-9-23**] - EUS revealed a T2N0 disease.
[**2109-10-2**] - PET/CT ruled out metastasis
[**2109-10-14**] - C1D1 Cisplatin (75 mg/m2 Day1)/5-Fluorouracil (1000
mg/m2 days 1, 2, 3 and 4) concurrent chemoradiation
[**2109-11-11**] - C2D1 Cisplatin (75 mg/m2 Day1)/5-Fluorouracil (1000
mg/m2 days 1, 2, 3 and 4) concurrent chemoradiation
[**2109-11-19**] - [**2109-11-23**] Admitted for poor PO intake and esophageal
pain

[**2110-1-24**] [**2110-1-24**] [**2110-1-29**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **]/ttl
Previous biopsies:    [**-1/5134**]  small bowel.

DIAGNOSIS:

I.  Stomach and esophagus, esophagogastrectomy (A-U):

     1.  Esophageal adenocarcinoma; see synoptic report.

     2.  Sixteen lymph nodes, no malignancy identified (0/16).

II.  Lymph node, para-esophageal (V):  One lymph node, no
malignancy identified (0/1).

III.  Lymph node, subcarinal (W):  One lymph node, no malignancy
identified (0/1).

IV.  Fundus of stomach, resection (X-Y):  Within normal limits.

V.  Gastric donut (Z):  Segment of stomach within normal limits.

VI.  Esophageal donut (AA):  Segment of esophagus within normal
limits.

[**2110-1-27**] CT Torso :

 1. Post-surgical changes consistent with esophagectomy with
intrathoracic
anastomosis. Bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions
which
measure near simple fluid in Hounsfield units and do not contain
foci of gas.  Mucosal enhancement of the gastric conduit is
intact. Given contrast was not administered orally, a small leak
cannot be excluded. If clinically indicated and feasible,
revaluation after per-oral contrast administration may be
obtained.
2. Enlarging hypodense lesion in the interpolar region of the
left kidney,
suspected to represent a cyst with complication or hemorrhage.
Consider
ultrasound for further characterization.
3. High-density lesion within the small bowel mesentery adjacent
to
surgically placed jejunostomy tube likely represents a small
mesenteric
hematoma.

[**2110-1-29**] Chest CT :
1. Post-surgical changes consistent with esophagectomy and
intrathoracic
anastomosis remain stable. Right pleural effusion, which appears
partially
loculated and with an intrafissural component appears
substantially decreased in size. Right chest tube and a
mediastinal drain appearing in place.
2. Previously visualized left pleural effusion has resolved.
However, there are no new parenchymal opacities in the left
lower lobe suggestive of a developing infection versus
re-expansion edema. Clinical correlation is recommended.
3. Previously visualized hypodensity in the left lobe of thyroid
is not
clearly delineated on today's study. If further characterization
is
necessary, ultrasound is recommended.

[**2110-1-30**] Ba swallow :
Status post esophagectomy with intrathoracic anastomosis. No
leak or obstruction. Mild narrowing at anastomotic site,
expected after
recent surgery.

[**2110-1-31**] CXR :
1. Stable large right pleural effusion.
2. No pneumothorax.

[**2110-2-4**] CTA :
1. No pulmonary emboli.
2. Following removal of pleural drains, large, nonhemorrhagic
right pleural effusion, has increased with new large anterior
loculation, responsible for persistent severe atelectasis, right
middle and lower lobes. Small left pleural effusion stable.
Small pericardial effusion increased; no evidence of cardiac
tamponade.
3. Probable small airway obstruction.

[**2110-2-9**] CXR:
Heterogeneous pulmonary opacification has improved since [**2-7**], but heart size is normal, and pulmonary vasculature is not
particularly engorged.  Therefore if this is a persistence of a
slowly improving pulmonary edema, I cannot ascribe it to cardiac
decompensation and therefore other causes should
be considered, including drug reaction. Lateral view
demonstrates that the
opacification in the right lower lung is due to pleural fluid
collection in the major fissure. Heart size is normal. I see no
pneumothorax. Mediastinum has a normal post-operative
appearance. The layering component of right pleural effusion is
small and unchanged since removal of the right pleural tube.
Infusion catheter ends low in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
