Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 60 year old male with multiple medical problems
including severe peripheral vascular disease and a non-healing
left foot ulcer on which an angiogram was performed on previous
admission [**2195-7-7**] without complication.  Patient was scheduled
for surgery [**2195-7-13**] and discharged home. Patient was found to
have chronic renal insufficiency on previous admission and was
discharged with stable Cr.

On this admission patient underwent a Left superficial femoral
artery to
dorsalis pedis trunk bypass with reverse greater saphenous vein.
 The operation was uncomplicated.  Patient returned to the
floor.   During his post-operative recovery patient experienced
an episode of tachycardia for which he was followed by
cardiology.  ECG and cardiac enzymes were found to be negative
and the patient was asymptomatic.  Cardiology was consulted and
it was determined no further workup was necessary.  During his
hospital admission patient's creatinine rose to 2.5.  He was
given IV bicarbonate and at discharge his creatinine has
stabilized.

Patient was discharged home on POD5 with visiting nurse to
monitor his leg incision for signs of infection and with PT to
help patient ambulate.
