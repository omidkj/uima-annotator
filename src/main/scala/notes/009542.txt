Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Confusion, difficulty breathing

Reason for MICU transfer: Hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-3-1**] - Central line placement in IJ, removed [**2120-3-4**]
[**2120-3-4**] - PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104573**] is a 68 year-old woman with extensive stage small
cell lung cancer with a painful, large R abdominal mass causing
T12-L3 neurologic symptoms s/p palliative chemotherapy with
Carboplatin/Etoposide and recent initiation of radiation to the
abdominal mass presenting with altered mental status, fever, and
difficulty breathing. Patient reports cough over the past few
months and had recent admission for pneumonia on [**2120-2-7**].  She does not remember what happened at home today, but
believes she was confused prior to presentation. Per report,
patient's husband went to work today and was unable to get in
touch with patient by telephone.  [**Name (NI) **] son went to her home
and found her confused, but alert.  Yesterday morning, patient
had some emesis but then tolerated lunch and dinner.  She last
had chemotherapy one week ago, and is due for chemotherapy again
today.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 99.7 133 153/83 20 99% 2L NC. On
arrival to the ED patient was tachypnic with increased work of
breathing.  She was dehydrated on arrival and IV access was
initially difficult to obtain. Patient was found to have a
peri-hilar pneumonia on chest x-ray. She received acetaminophen
1000 mg PO x1, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin.
Antibiotics were chosen prior to return of labs, which revealed
neutropenia. During ED stay, pt became tachycardiac to 140s and
blood pressure dropped to 80/40.  This initially improved with
4L IVF and patient was going to be admitted to the floor.
However, blood pressure dropped to 80/40 and patient required
right IJ placement and neosynephrine to maintain blood pressure.
 Vitals on transfer: Temperature 98.2, Pulse 81, Respiratory
Rate 16, Blood Pressure 99/60, O2 Saturation 96 on 4L.  Prior to
arrival to the MICU, patient had head CT for AMS. DNR/DNI code
status was confirmed with patient and husband in [**Name (NI) **], but
noninvasive ventilation and pressors are acceptable. Prior to
transfer patient received a total of 6.3L of IVF during ED
course.

On arrival to MICU, patient feels slightly better.  She
continues to complain of cough, but does not feel short of
breath.  She denies headache and visual changes, but does
endorse some neck stiffness after having central line placed.
No abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or
hematochezia. No dysuria.  Pt does endorse back pain, which is
consistent with her chronic back pain.

Micro:
-BCx ([**2120-3-1**]): No growth at discharge
-UCx ([**2120-3-1**]): No growth
-C. diff ([**2120-3-2**]): Positive for C. diff toxin

Imaging:
-CXR ([**2120-3-1**]):
1. Findings suggesting slight pulmonary congestion.
2. Focal right infrahilar opacity of recent onset which may
reflect
atelectasis or potentially early pneumonia in the appropriate
setting; if
pulmonary symptoms are present then short-term follow-up
radiographs,
preferably with PA and lateral technique if feasible, are
suggested.

-CXR ([**2120-3-1**]):
1. Worsening interstitial abnormality suggesting
mild-to-moderate pulmonary
vascular congestion. More confluent right perihilar opacity.
Although an
asymmetric pattern of pulmonary congestion could be considered
particularly
given rapid onset in the same timeframe, coinciding pneumonia
should also be considered.
2. Satisfactory placement of central venous catheter.

-CT head ([**2120-3-1**]): No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. If clinical suspicion for an intracranial mass is high,
MRI is the recommended study of choice if not contra-indicated.

-CXR ([**2120-3-2**]): Right internal jugular central line with its tip
in the proximal SVC. More confluent airspace consolidation in
the right lower lobe which is concerning for pneumonia.
Pulmonary venous hypertension without evidence of overt
pulmonary edema. No large left effusion. No pneumothorax.
Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.

-CXR ([**2120-3-4**]): Interval placement of a left subclavian PICC
line which has its tip in the
distal SVC. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in
the
proximal-to-mid SVC, unchanged. There continue to be streaky
opacities at the left base which may reflect subsegmental
atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration cannot be
excluded. The airspace consolidation at the right base has
significantly improved, and given the interval change, this
would favor resolving atelectasis rather than an acute
infectious process. Clinical correlation is advised. No
pneumothorax is seen. No evidence of pulmonary edema. Overall
stable cardiac and mediastinal contours given patient rotation
on the current study.
