Allergies:
Aspirin / Warfarin / Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
Patient being transferred with mediastinal mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
FNA of mediastinal mass
Bronchoscopy
Intubation with mechanical ventilation
Tracheostomy
surgical biospy of mediastinal mass

History of Present Illness:
89F italian speaking woman with COPD, HTN, DM who presented to
outside hospital on [**2191-11-3**] with increasing shortness of breath
cough and wheezing. As per outside records, she had a cough
productive of yellow sputum associated with shortness of breath
for approximately 2 months.
.
On CT Chest she was found to have a large mediastinal mass
deviating the trachea to the right, heterogeneous in nature
suggestive of goiter with left hilar LAD and left lower
consolidation with air bronchograms suggestive of post
obstructive pneumonia. Patient was initially started on IV
steroids, CTX and Flagyl and subsequently transitioned to
Levo/flagyl.
.
Course was complicated by afib requiring transient Dilt gtt and
ARF with elevation fo Cr to 4.0 on [**2191-11-9**]. Patient had a renal
US without evidence of renal stones and renal lytes suggestive
of a pre-renal etiology.
.
Patient did not require intubation and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation

Imaging:
Thyroid US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of a large vascular
left thyroid nodule without immediate complication.
2. No right thyroid lobe. Correlation with patient history is
recommended.
.
.
CXR admission:
IMPRESSION:
Improving left lower lobe atelectasis. Followup chest
radiographs are
recommended to document complete resolution.
Standard position of the ET tube and NG tube
.
CT Torso admission
IMPRESSION:
1. Incompletely imaged heterogenous soft tissue mass containing

calcifications extending along the left thoracic inlet and upper
retrosternal region causing compression and rightward deviation
of the trachea. The mass does not appear to invade mediastinal
structures. Diagnostic considerations include a large thyroid
mass or multinodular goiter with retrosternal component, much
less likely a thymic lesion.
2. Low position of the endotracheal tube with its tip just above
the carina.
3. Peribronchiolar nodular opacities and ground-glass
attenuation in the posterior right upper lobe may represent
evolving infectious etiology or aspiration.
4. Left lower lobe collapse with opacification of the left lower
lobe bronchus. Further evaluation with bronchoscopy is advised
to exclude an endobronchial lesion or extrinsic compression at
the left hilum.
5. 2.0 cm ill-defined low attenuation in the upper pole of the
right kidney, which is incompletely characterized on this
non-contrast study. If indicated, further assessment could be
performed with a dedicated renal ultrasound.
6. Generalized anasarca.
.
Head CT [**11-13**]:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Evaluation for
metastatic disease limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
If there is high clinical concern, further characterization with
contrast enhanced MRI or CT is recommended.
2. Moderate cerebral atrophy and chronic microvascular ischemic
change.
.
Left upper ex U/S [**11-18**]:
DVT involving both brachial veins and the basilic vein along the
catheter.
.
Thyroid biopsy [**11-25**]: Left thyroid, biopsy:
Papillary carcinoma, follicular variant
.
Right upper ex U/S [**11-30**]:
Deep venous thrombosis of the right upper extremity isolated to
the right internal jugular vein surrounding the patient's
central venous catheter.
.
Discharge CXR: There is overall increase in perihilar haziness
and vascular engorgement suggesting volume overload/pulmonary
edema. No change in the bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis noted. The tracheostomy, the right
internal jugular line and the Dobbhoff tube are in unchanged
positions including the proximal position of the Dobbhoff tube.


Brief Hospital Course:
89F with COPD, HTN, DM, with mediatinal mass s/p intubation on
arrival for airway protection and s/p extubation on [**2191-11-22**] and
reintubation for excessive secretions on [**2191-11-24**]. Now with trach
for vent weaning.  She has large mediastinal mass with is c/w
papillary thyroid ca follicular type.  Hospital course by
problem:
.
# Mediastinal Mass: Head/Torso CT negative for possible
metastatic disease, although done without contrast. Endocrine
was consulted and felt this was likely a goiter.  She had FNA
which was indeterminant.  Then, during trach placement, had
biopsy which showed papillary thyroid cancer, follicular type.
Patient with normal TFTs, Thyroglobulin 1170.  She and her
family were notified of the results.  She was seen by endocrine
and thoracics surgery.  Followup appointments were scheduled in
near future to discuss plan of care: surgical resection vs.
observation.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated for airway protection
given stridor. She developed a MRSA pneumonia and had tracheitis
with [**Female First Name (un) **]. She was treated with 8 days of vanc and 5 days of
fluconazole. She was also on a prednisone taper for COPD (last
dose 11/8). She was extubated on [**2191-11-22**] and but was unable to
clear her secretions and was reintubated. She was not passing
the SBT and was trached in the OR by CT surgery for weening off
the vent.  She intermittently tolerated trach collar but was
largely vent dependent with PS 10/5 FiO2 0.50 especially when
lying flat.
- please pull sutures out from trach on [**12-7**] per thoracics
recommendations.
.
# DVT from LUEx PICC and right CVL IJ: treated with heparin gtt
until platelets fell. Then changed to argatroban given concerns
of HIT.  HIT ab neg x2.  We restarted heparin gtt and coumadin
on [**11-28**].  Coumadin: [**11-28**] 2.5mg, [**11-29**] held, [**11-30**] 5mg.  INR 1.5 on
[**12-1**].  Plan: bridge with heparin and continue with coumadin
until INR [**2-26**].  Goal: anticoagulate for at least 1 month after
[**11-30**].  [**Month (only) 116**] need further anticoagulation for her afib.
- She has documented allx to coumadin.  We could not confirm
etiology but thought it was likely bleeding.  We monitored her
for several days after coumadin given and saw no allx reaction.
Monitor INR closely
- Please pull right IJ CVL when heparin gtt no longer needed
since it has a clot alongside it.  If you still need access,
consider new line.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of heparin and vanc, and
improving since Vanc has been discontinued. Does not appear to
be hemolyzing. Patient started on Argatroban empirically,
although HIT Ab returned negative; resend HIT was also negative.
Last day of vanc was [**11-23**] and platelets have already rebounded.

.
# Pneumonia: She presented from the OSH with a diagnosis of
post-obstructive pneumonia and in the midst of a 14 day course
of levo/flagyl.  Also received fluconazole for tracheitis and
vanco for MRSA PNA (8d).  Then had recurrent sputum pos for MRSA
PNA so started on linezolid on [**11-27**].  Needs to continue this
until [**1
