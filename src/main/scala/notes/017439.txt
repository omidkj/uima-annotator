Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 yo woman with laryngeal carcinoma s/p recent
trach and PEG, schizoaffective disorder, and COPD admitted with
hypotension and increased secretions after chemoradiation.  Ms.
[**Known lastname **] came from [**Hospital1 **] for chemo-radiation today, for which she
requires sedation. After administration of propofol, patient's
BP dropped to the 70s.  She got 1.5 liter fluid in clinic and BP
came back up initially but then went back down into 80s.  Pt
denied any fever, chills, or rigor. No cough but increased white
secretion from trach. No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. No
dysuria or frequency. She was sent to the ED.

In the emergency department, initial vitals were T 99.2
(baseline ~96-97), BP 91/50, HR 63, RR 12, satting 95% on trach
mask.  Chest exam revealed coarse and rhonchorous breath sounds
throughout.  She was given an additional 2L IVF.  She was
mentating well throughout.  Received levofloxacin and vancomycin
for empiric coverage.  Lactate 2.8.  No leukocytosis or left
shift.  CXR with no acute process.  Due to her requirement for
frequent suctioning in the ED, it was felt that she required ICU
level nursing care.  She wwas admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.

ROS:  Patient complains of dry mouth, headache, and shortness of
breath.  Also some nausea and constipation.  Denies chest pain,
cough, vomiting or diarrhea.  She is not able to describe
whether her secretions are increased from baseline or for how
long.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 57-year-old woman with laryngeal cancer s/p trach but
not ventilator dependent, who was admitted with hypotension and
increased secretions after sedation with propofol for
chemo-radiation.
.
INCREASED SECRETIONS:  By report, patient was requiring more
suctioning than at baseline, with copious thin, white
secretions.  She did not have a fever or leukocytosis, making
pneumonia less likely, and there were no signs of a COPD
exacerbation.  Over the course of her first hospital day, she
went back to her baseline of suctioning every 2 hours and
remained stable.  The decision was made not to give her any
antibiotics, and she did well.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was continued on
advair, atrovent, and albuterol.
.
HYPOTENSION:  Patient was hypotensive after sedation for her
XRT, but this resolved with 3L of IV fluids.  Her lactate was
elevated to 2.8 on admission and improved to normal with
hydration.  Likely etiology was dehydration worsened by propofol
administration.  No signs of infection or sepsis.
.
ELEVATED TRANSAMINASES:  Hepatic injury pattern, no signs of
cholestasis.  Had been normal prior to [**12-26**], when she received
her first chemo dose.  Hepatotoxicity or transaminitis is not
listed as an adverse effect of either carboplatin or taxol.  Her
statin was held during admission.  Upon discharge, her LFTs
trended back to a normal range.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] should have her LFTs
rechecked in one week, and if normal, her statin can be
restarted at that time.
.
SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER: Continued on her home olanzapine.
Consent for care obtained from her sister who is her HCP.
.
LARYNGEAL CANCER: She is currently receiving chemotherapy and
XRT.  Next XRT planned for Monday [**1-7**] and next chemo on [**1-10**].
 Patient was seen by heme/onc consult team during this
admission.
.
HTN/CAD:  Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was previously on lisinopril and atenolol, but
is not currnetly receiving these medications.  She was slightly
hypertensive on admission but was managed conservatively given
her recent hypotension.  Her pressures normalized.  Continued on
home aspirin.
.
ANEMIA: Baseline hct 30-33, current hct 28.4.  Recent iron
studies suggestive of anemia of chronic disease. No evidence of
acute blood loss.  We continued to monitor patient's hematocrit.
