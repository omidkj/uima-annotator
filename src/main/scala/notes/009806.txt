Brief Hospital Course:
 [**2140-5-5**] Attempted placement of peritoneal dialysis catheter
with exploratory laparoscopy. PD cath was attempted for
hypotension during hemodialysis sessions. PD catheter placement
was unsuccessful due to bleeding and adhesions. Lysis of
adhesions was done. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please refer to
operative notes for details. She was sleepy postop with stable
vital signs.

Postop day 1, she was dialyzed via the RUE AVG. She became
somnolent with low grade temperature and O2 desaturation to 80s.
CXR showed mild vascular congestion/fluid overload.  Given desat
and mental status, she was sent to the SICU for urgent
hemodialysis. Troponins were sent and were negative. Blood
cultures were also sent. Chest CTA was done to r/o PE. This was
negative. Hemodialysis was performed for volume overload with 2
liters removed.

On postop day 2, CXR again appeared wet and hemodialysis was
again performed for 2 liters of fluid removed. CXR also
demonstrated vascular congestion with atelectasis (left greater
than right side). On [**5-8**], CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema and
opacification at the right base with poor definition of the
hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis and effusion. There
was concern for aspiration pneumonia give elevation in WBC to
16, alteration in mental status and CXR. Ceftriaxone and
Azithromycin were started on [**5-7**].

Vital signs and mental status improved. Blood cultures were un
finalized, but negative to date. Hemodialysis was done again on
[**Month/Year (2) 766**] [**5-9**], removing 1.8 liters. She continued to wear her
CPAP. Diet was advanced and tolerated. Abdominal incisions were
intact and without redness or drainage.

PT assessed her and recommended rehab. She remained afebrile
with stable vital signs. The plan was to continue just the
Azithromycin for 1 week from discharge.

She will transfer to [**Hospital1 599**] [**Location (un) 55**] rehab with plan to go
to [**Location (un) **] Dialysis in [**Hospital1 8**]
[**Location (un) 96522**] # 1
[**Hospital1 8**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 98981**]
on [**Telephone/Fax (1) 766**]-Wednesday-Friday schedule. Hemodialysis will be at
11am on [**5-11**]. She should continue to be on a 750ml fluid
restriction.
