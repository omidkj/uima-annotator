Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Pt woke up this morning with R sided pleuritic chest pain that
awoke her from sleep.  She said it felt sharp, worse with
inspiration.  No SOB but tried not to take deep breaths [**2-26**]
pain.  Has had recent cough about 2 weeks ago, given
azithromycin with resolution of cough, no production.  No recent
prolonged travel - longest car ride was about 1 1/2 hours.  Pt
denies swelling in legs.  Pt denies fevers at home.  Has not had
any miscarriages in the past.  Pt's last [**Last Name (un) 3907**] was last year -
did have a breast biopsy 2-3 years ago but was not malignant.
Had a colonoscopy 6-8 months ago, negative, no h/o blood in
stool.
.
At the OSH, CT chest noted 11mm lung nodule, 14mm thyroid
nodule, and saddle pulmonary embolus.  Pt was started on a
heparin gtt and was transferred here.  At [**Hospital1 18**], her vital signs
were stable - 98, 77, 121/80, 16, 98% 2L.  She was guaiac
negative.  CXR was performed.  Bedside echocardiogram showed no
RV collapse.


Past Medical History:
multiple sclerosis
hyperlipidemia

Social History:
Lives with her husband.  Used to work at a jeweler's and at a
bank, stopped in [**2171**] [**2-26**] MS.  Pt is ambulatory at home and gets
around by herself.  Has been smoking 1/2ppd for about 40 years.
Occasional social EtOH, h/o cocaine use in [**2163**], none recently.

Family History:
no h/o known clots or miscarriages

Physical Exam:
VS:  98.0  109/64  81  14  100% 3L NC
Gen: slightly anxious, otherwise NAD, no respiratory distress
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MM dry, OP clear
Neck: no JVD, no cervical LAD, no thyroid nodules palpated
CV: RRR, nl S1, loud P2, no m/r/g
Pulm: crackles at bases L > R, no wheezes
Abd: soft, obese, NT/ND, - masses
Ext: 1+ pitting edema, RLE with more erythema and warmth than
LLE, no tenderness to palpation of calves, no palpable cords

Pertinent Results:
Chest CT (OSH read): PE involving both main pulmonary artery
bifurcations and branches, 11mm nodular density in LUL;
atelectasis at both bases; 14mm low attenuation nodule in L lobe
of thyroid
.
CXR: Linear opacity in L lung base, atelectasis vs early PNA,
cannot r/o small L pleural effusion; cardiomegaly
.
EKG:  59bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, deep Q in III but no S1 or
T3, poor R wave progression

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yoF with history of multiple sclerosis transferred from OSH
with saddle pulmonary embolism and left lung nodule.
.
# Pulmonary embolus: Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management
of saddle pulmonary embolus.  Pt did not have any risk factors
for thrombus, although LUL nodule in setting of tobacco use is
concerning for underlying malignancy.  Patient remained
hemodynamically stable without evidence of right heart strain on
echo and no RAD on EKG.  The magnitude of PE and hemodynamic
stability may suggest a chronicity of her process.  Patient had
large RLE DVT and a pulomonary/interventional pulmonary consults
were placed.  An IVC filter was not deemed an appopriate option.
 CT head had been concerning for embolus/PFO showing possible
infarction; MRI head without these findings, however, showed
changes consistent with multiple sclerosis.
- Coumadin - lovenox bridge started [**2-23**], to have PT/INR checked
[**2-26**] by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 702**] by him, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36552**].  Plan for
coumadin 5mg  x 2days, [**2-24**] and [**2-25**], with INR check [**2-26**] -
further assessment of coumadin dose as above.
- coagulation studies/panel will need to be undertaken as an
outpatient.
- [**Month (only) 116**] need 6-9 months of anti-coagulation, possibly lifelong if
this is indeed secondary to malignancy
- PULM CONSULT RECS:
1. Chest CT (non-contrast in 6 weeks).  She will need follow-up
which can be local, but alternatively she may follow up here.
2. Continue anticoagulation, as above
3. No role for IVC filter in this hemodynamically stable patient
who is tolerating anticoagulation.
4. Usual hypercoagulation workup (Protein C, S; ATIII; lupus
anticoagulant; cardiolipin antibodies; prothrombin gene mutation
[**Numeric Identifier 23885**]; homocysteine).  Also age appropriate cancer screenings as
outpatient.
.
# Lung mass: 11 mm nodule seen in LUL on OSH CT chest. PE raises
suspicion of pulmonary malignancy.
- Biopsy deferred due to size of mass.  Needs CT follow-up in
[**4-30**] weeks, scheduled follow-up with [**Hospital1 **] pulmonologist in [**Month (only) 547**],
as above.
.
# Thyroid nodule: 14 mm nodule seen on OSH CT chest. PE raises
suspicion of malignancy.
- Will need reassessment of this nodule, perhaps biopsy as
deemed indicated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36552**], as well as thryoid function
tests repeated.
.
# Multiple sclerosis: Patient functional at baseline;
ambulatory. No acute issues.
- Continue topamax
- Patient would optimally benefit from seeing a neurologist on
an outpatient basis.

# FEN/GI - Low cholesterol diet

drawn, with the results given to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36552**] (the goal INR is
between [**2-27**]). Stop the lovenox shots once Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 36552**] instructs

.
Given your pulmonary embolus and the findings on the CT scan of
