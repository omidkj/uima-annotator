Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Proteus [**Name (NI) 11646**]  Pt was continued on ceftriaxone for
proteus bacteremia.  He defervesced after first day.  His
cultures from L heel ulcer also grew dense proteus so this was
felt to be the source.  The patient will be continued on IV 1g
QD ceftriaxone for 4 weeks from [**2100-8-13**] and Vancomycin 750mg QHD
for 2more weeks (given history of MRSA OM) for osteomyelitis but
duration will be determined by outpatient Podiatry Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and will depend on how wound is heeling.

2.  PVD-  The worsening of his heel ulcer over the prior 2 weeks
was found to be secondary to decreased flow in his L bypass
graft.  Vascular was consulted and arteriogram was performed on
[**8-17**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and angioplasty was successfully performed
on distal graft.  Given the improvement in his distal blood flow
it was felt that the L heel osteomyelitis might respond to
conservative treatment with abx and wound care.  The patient is
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to assess
progression of wound and vascular status.

3.  Rectus sheath hematoma-  During hospital course pt developed
rectus sheath hematoma at sight of heparin injections.  ASA
which had briefly been started was d/c'd for good along with hep
sq inj.  Pt's Hct drifted down to 25 so he required several
blood transfusions to aim for Hct >30.  Given his
thrombocytopenia (plts as low as 30) he was transfused several
bags of plts to keep count >100.  The hematoma stabilized so pt
was felt stable for d/c with plans to recheck Hct and plts at HD
and transfuse to keep Hct>30 and Plts>50.

4.  [**Name (NI) 5964**] Pt was continued on HD MWF.  All medications were
renally dosed.  He was continued on Epo at HD.

5.  [**Name (NI) 298**]  Pt was admitted with mental status change that
improved with treatment of infection.  He had a MRI of his head
which revealed diffuse microvascular dz but no acute CVA.
Currently holding antiplatelet agents given low plt count.
Patient with 90% stenosis of R carotid artery, however refusing
surgical intervention.

6. Pain - The patient has some pain from the ulcer, as well as
from the rectus sheath hematoma.  We have started oxycodone 2.5
mg QID, as well as PRN, which is keeping his pain
well-controlled.  He may be switched to longer acting meds once
at rehab.  We found that a dose of 5 mg of oxycodone q 6 hours
caused confusion.

7.  Code status-  Code status was discussed with patient and
family.  He again affirmed that he was DNR/DNI.  Given his poor
prognosis, goals of care were discussed and patient and family
agreed to current treatment plan which included antibiotics and
transfusions as necessary but avoiding major surgical
interventions.  Things should be discussed with patient and
family as they arise on a situational basis.
