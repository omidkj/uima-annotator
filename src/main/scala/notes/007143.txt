CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 88-year-old male
with a history of atrial fibrillation, pernicious anemia, who
was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**], where he presented with
abdominal and back pain, described as a burning sensation,
which had occurred and then progressed over three days prior
to admission.  Abdominal CT was obtained, which showed an
abdominal aortic aneurysm of 6 cm, with a large
retroperitoneal hematoma.  His hematocrit at that time was
31, but dropped to 26.  The patient was urgently transferred
to our institution for further evaluation and treatment.

At the time of arrival, his hematocrit was 12.  The patient
was taken to the Emergency Room for emergent vascular
intervention.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Significant for chronic atrial
fibrillation for which he is anticoagulated.  There is no
record of any previous surgeries.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Coumadin, Digoxin, Lopressor.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On arrival to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit post-surgery, vital signs showed a temperature of
34.5, atrial fibrillation with a rate of 113, blood pressure
152/67, oxygen saturation 100%.  Pulmonary artery pressure
was 25/16, wedge 22, CVP 10.  The patient was intubated and
sedated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
showed a left pupil of 2 mm and the right pupil was with
cataract.  The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The cardiac examination was a regular rhythm.  Abdominal
examination was soft, nondistended, with rubber dams in place
with [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains to suction.  Lower extremity pulse
examination showed a left dorsalis pedis which was palpable,
and a right dorsalis pedis which was palpable and
Dopplerable.

LABORATORY DATA:   The patient's initial CBC was white count
of 7.2, hematocrit 39.9, platelet count 16.  The patient's
fibrinogen level was 102.  The patient's CBC on [**2196-6-29**] was a
white count of 11.9, hematocrit 23.4.  Electrolytes on
admission:  Sodium 145, potassium 3.4, glucose 52.
Electrolytes on [**2196-6-29**]:  Sodium 131, potassium 4.2, chloride
99, bicarbonate 26, BUN 29, creatinine 1.4, glucose 122, with
an anion gap of 10.  Platelet count on [**2196-6-29**] was 306,000.
Initial chest x-ray was obtained post-surgery, which showed
the tip of the endotracheal tube at 2.5 cm above the carina.
The catheter was satisfactorily in position.  The findings
were suggestive of mild congestive failure.

Chest x-ray of [**2196-6-27**] showed a tracheostomy remains in
satisfactory position.  The heart shows slight left
ventricular enlargement, but no vascular redistribution to
indicate associated cardiac failure.  The pacemaker is a dual
chamber. Electrodes again are noted.  The lungs show collapse
and consolidation of the left lower lobe behind the heart.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions present.  There
is some loss of translucency over the right lower zone and
along the minor intralobar fissure, could be do to posterior
layering.  [**6-6**] ultrasound of the gallbladder showed
gallbladder sludge without evidence of cholecystitis.  The
gallbladder was not thickened.  There was no pericholecystic
fluid or wall edema. The common bile duct is unremarkable and
measures 3 mm.  There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation.

On [**2196-6-22**], the patient had video laryngeal swallow done.  It
shows a limited study without demonstration of aspiration.
There was early penetration and residual barium.  The patient
demonstrated some difficulty with swallowing instructions to
initiate spontaneous swallowing.  There was mild early
penetration demonstrated with nectar.  There was more frank
early penetration demonstrated with thin liquids as well as
early spillage.  No aspiration was witnessed.  Residual thin
barium was noted in the folliculi and piriform sinuses
without spontaneous clearing.  This cleared with prompt
swallowing.

The chest x-ray on [**2196-6-28**] was unchanged.  Abdominal CT was
done on [**2196-6-28**].  The results of this study demonstrated
bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar
atelectasis and the right kidney was infarcted with a right
retroperitoneal hematoma.  There are no signs to suggest the
presence of abscess.  There is a dense vascular
calcification.  He is status post abdominal aortic aneurysm
repair without evidence of leak.  CT of the head done on
[**2196-6-1**] showed no mass or hemorrhage.  There was evidence of
remote strokes.  There was abnormal soft tissue within
multiple sinuses, including the mastoids.  There was noted a
right frontal lobe infarct, old, and there was a lacunar
infarct in the posterior aspect of the left putamen.  There
was evidence of prior cataract surgery.  There was maxillary,
frontal, ethmoid and sphenoid sinus thickening.  There was
sclerosis of the mastoid cells, with some increased soft
tissue density in the right mastoid.

Cultures obtained on [**2196-5-30**] were blood, urine and sputum.
The blood cultures and urine cultures were no growth and
finalized.  The respiratory culture showed sparse growth of
oropharyngeal flora and aspergillus [**Country 11730**] rare growth.
Cultures on [**2196-6-1**] of the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains were no
growth and finalized.  Blood fungal cultures obtained on
[**2196-5-31**] were negative for acid fast bacilli or
microbacterium.  The catheter tip was no growth.

The abdominal wound culture on [**5-31**] was no growth and
finalized.  CBL tip on [**6-10**] was without growth.  Blood
cultures on [**6-27**] x 2 were no growth but not finalized.  Urine
culture on [**6-27**] grew greater than 100,000 pseudomonas
aeruginosa.  The patient was sensitive to piperacillin,
tobramycin.  Sensitivities to ceftazidime, imipenem and
piperacillin were pending at the time of dictation.  Sputum
cultures obtained on [**6-27**] grew moderate pseudomonas and
gram-negative rods, moderate growth.  The sensitivities were
pending at the time of dictation.  The stool for C. difficile
which was sent on [**2196-6-16**] was positive.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 6265**] on an emergent basis.  He was taken immediately to
the operating room.  He underwent an abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair secondary to rupture.  The intraoperative
course was complicated by intraoperative ventricular
tachycardia which required cardioversion.  The patient was
taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.
He was in critical condition.  He was begun on perioperative
Kefzol at that time.  His initial blood gases on transfer to
the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit were 7.36/35/116/21/-4.  His
postoperative hematocrit was 34.  His BUN was 28, his
creatinine was 1.4.

On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit for continued care, and remained
intubated.  He required transfusion of a unit of platelets
and two units of fresh frozen plasma.  His blood gases were
7.42/36/196/20/0.  His hematocrit was 31.4, with a white
count of 6.2 and a platelet count of 99,000.  His BUN was 19,
creatinine 1.2, potassium 4.0.  His initial CKs were 163 with
an MB fraction of 16 and a troponin-I from 1.3 to 6.5.   The
patient was begun on dobutamine secondary to diminished
cardiac index.

On postoperative day two, he remained in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  He required increasing PEEP for a
diminished PCO2.  An echocardiogram was done at that time,
which showed left ventricular function was well preserved.
His total CK enzymes, serial, were 109 with an MB of 6, 139
with an MB of 8, and 113 with an MB of 8.  His troponin
serial enzymes were 4.6, 6.2, and 8.1.  He remained on
dobutamine with intravenous nitroglycerin.  He required fluid
boluses because of low urinary output.

On [**5-29**], Renal was consulted because of increasing
creatinine.  They felt it was secondary to acute tubular
necrosis, and recommended maintaining a systolic blood
pressure greater than 120.  They could dose all of
