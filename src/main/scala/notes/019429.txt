Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p LIJ, a-line, intubation
midline PICC placement (R)
s/p LIJ insertion and removal


History of Present Illness:
73yo F with h/o atrial fibrillation s/p atrial thrombectomy on
coumadin, dCHF, s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 103223**] MVR, DM2 who presents from
[**Hospital3 2558**] with complaints of dyspnea.  Per ED resident and
EMS record, she had 1 episode of N/V overnight and reported
feeling generally unwell.  She denied abominal pain/diarrhea
(again per ED/EMS report).  Due to her worsening tachypnea this
morning, she was transported to the ED by EMS.
.
Of note, she was admitted x 2 in [**Month (only) **] for decompensated dCHF.
During her first [**Month (only) **] admission, it appears that urine culture
was positive for >100K on [**6-25**] however it does not appear that
she received antibiotics for this.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 95.7  BP: 108/58 RR: 35
O2sat: 100% NRB.  Labs were notable new renal failure with
creatinine of 2.3, bicarb of 7 (AG 26), and lactate of 10.  ABG
was 7.19/25/85.  Initial K+ was 7.3 (sl. hemolyzed); she
received regular insulin and amp of dextrose, calcium gluconate,
and an amp of bicarb and came down to 6.3 prior to tx to ICU.
CXR was without infiltrate.  UA showed [**3-19**] epis, 3-5 WBCs, [**3-19**]
RBCs, few bacteria.  CT abd/pelvis was obtained w/o PO and IV
contrast and, although limited [**2-16**] to lack of contrast, aside
from very small amount of ascites and diverticulosis, there was
no clear pathology/source of infection.  She received 750mg IV
levofloxacin, 1g vancomycin IV, 500mg IV flagyl.  She
additionally received 1g tylenol PR for rectal temp of 100.8.
SBP dipped to the 80s and dopamine and levophed were initiated
via PIVs after unsuccessful attempts at B/L femoral veins and
out of concern for ? clot in IJ (thus not attempted).  She
received 4.5L NS prior to transfer to the ICU.  She made only 45
cc urine while in the ED.  She became increasingly tachypneic
with increased WOB and somnolence and was intubated in this
setting.
.
ROS:  Unable to obtain as patient is intubated and sedated.  Per
tx report she had emesis beginning night PTA at NH.  Per ED
history, she denied abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dysuria.
Additionally, EMS sheet reports emesis overnight, however no
abdmonal pain nor diarrhea.

STUDIES:
[**2160-7-11**] CT abdomen/pelvis without oral and IV contrast:
1. Extremely limited study given lack of IV and oral contrast.
2. Cardiomegaly, right pleural effusion, right lower lobe
compressive atelectasis
3. Abdominal and pelvic ascites.
4. No evidence of bowel perforation or abscess.
5. Diverticulosis.
6. Punctate non-obstructing right renal calculus with evidence
ofcortical scarring.
.
[**2160-7-11**] CXR:  Small right sided pleural effusion. Stable
cardiomegaly without evidence of CHF.
.
[**2160-7-11**] RUQ U/S:  No gallbladder. Normal CBD. Patent portal and
hepatic veins.
.
[**2160-6-26**] LE edema:  No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
.
[**2160-6-25**] Echo: LVEF >55% (may be underestimated given degree of
MR underestimated), RA enlargement, 1+ MR, 3+ TR.

[**2160-7-16**] portable chest x-ray: There has been interval removal of
a left-sided internal jugular central venous line without
evidence of pneumothorax. The heart remains mild to moderately
enlarged with prominence of the vascular pedicle and a similar
degree of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is a
moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion and small left-sided
pleural effusion both of which are unchanged. The patient has
undergone mitral valve replacement and cardiomediastinal wires
remain intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 73yo F with a. fib/flutter on coumadin s/p thrombectomy,
h/o CVA, s/p MVR, dCHF presents with dyspnea found to have
severe metabolic acidosis with SIRS without clear source of
infection.  Currently, patient is on PO lasix as has required
Lasix since admission to the floor.
.
# SIRS: Hypothermic and hypotensive in the ED with leukocytosis
to 19K with 89% neutrophils of unclear source. Although UA was
not overwhelmingly positive, of concern is a positive urine
culture on [**6-25**] (>100K E. coli, sensi to
quinolones/cephalosporins) for which it does not appear she
received antibiotics. Initial presentation may represent
urosepsis. She did have reported symptom of N/V (no
diarrhea/abdominal pain); stool reportedly guaiac negative from
the ED. Hyperkalemia and markedly elevated lactate concerning
for bowel ischemia, but as above, no reported h/o abdominal
pain, guaiac negative, and CT abdomen/pelvis unrevealing. LFTs
abnormal on presentation, however she is s/p CCY and no clear
obstructive pathology on RUQ U/S to suggest obstruction and
ascending cholangitis; LFT abnormalities may be reflective of
shock liver, now have resolved.
- as no clear source of infection, d/ced cefepime [**7-14**]
- LFts normalized, blood cultures no growth
-urine cultures NG, UA with trace blood, otherwise WNL
-repeat CT scan w/ contrast of adomen and pelvis without acute
pathology
- c. diff and stool cultures negative
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt with tachypnea in the setting of
likely fluid overload.  Pt with h/o of dCHF with evidence of
pleural effusions by CT and x-ray.  No infiltrate on CXR to
suggest pulmonary infectious process.  Tachypnea improved and
then has worsened on [**7-16**], improved after diuresis.
- Pt requiring repeated boluses of lasix, without which she
became tachypneic, also required lasix drip in the unit
- prior to discharge pt getting 40 mg PO BID of Lasix with
adequate UOP and improved clinical exam.


# Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.8-1.0; creatinine
2.3 on admi
