Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD, type 2 DM,
and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the ED
with sepsis of unknown etiology. Pt was recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**11-16**] thorugh [**11-23**] with hypotension thought to be
secondary to overdiuresis at HD. However, a septic component to
the hypotension was also considered as the pt was found to have
citrobacter in her urine and C diff in her stool. Pt was then
discharged to [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life where she was in her normal
state of health until three days ago. Her son reports that she
then developed a headache and fevers started three days ago
which were treated with tylenol. Then, this morning she
developed fatigue and did not eat well. He son also notes that
she appeared to be working hard to breath. She was found to be
febrile to 101.9 and received levoflox and vancomycin. Pt was
then sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation. Per notes, pt
denied SOB, CP, and abdominal pain prior to intubation. She did
complain of a left frontal headache.
.
In the ED, the pt's VS were singificant for a fever of 103.8,
tachycardia in the 130s-150s, and initial hypertensive in the
140s. Her oxygen saturation was 96% on RA but she was tachypneic
to 31. She was obtunded and was thus intubated for airway
protection. Post-intubation, the pt's BP acutely dropped to
58/19 in the setting of propofol. When this medication was
discontinued, her BP came back up to the 70s-90s/30s-50s. Pt was
then initiated on the sepsis protocol. In the ED, she received
vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl, and cefepime (2 gm). She
received a total of 4 liters of NS then was started on levophed
for continued hypotension. Pt is now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further care.
.
Per pt's son, she is bedbound at baseline due to her multiple LE
femur fractures.

Past Medical History:
1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
2. Diabetic nephropathy resulting in ESRD for which she is on
HD. Pt was due for HD but missed it secondary to her illness.
She normally receives HD on Mon, Wed, and Fri.
3. Status post left femur fracture
4. Hyponatremia
5. Hypercholesterolemia
6. Unsteady gait
7. Cataracts
8. Back pain
9. Hypertension
10.Anemia of chronic disease
11. S/P L shoulder hemiarthroplasty following a left humeral
fracuture in [**10/2159**]- [**Last Name (un) 4163**] was complicated by a PEA arrest
secondary to PE.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
69 y/o female wtih PMH significant for ESRD on HD, type 2 DM,
and recent PE resulting in PEA arrest admitted through the ED
with sepsis of unknown etiology.
.
1. Sepsis/ID- Started on sepsis protocol. Unclear etiology
headache over the three days prior to admission in association
with fever was concerning for a CNS etiology. Covered broadly
with vancomycin, flagyl, and cefipime. Given stress dose
steroids empirically and [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim showed cortisol of 9.3-->10.3
therefore steroids continued. CXR, LP, UA and abdominal CT
showed no sign of infection. PICC line was removed empirically.
Tip could not be cultured due to contamination. Cultures drawn
off the HD cath are negative to date. Patient's LE ulcers appear
chronic and do not appear to be the source of infection. Her
left knee is slightly erythematous compared to the right but not
impressive. Joint is mobile. Nasal washings for influenza were
negative; culture pending. Patient improved over the next few
days. Steroids were discontinued. On [**11-27**] flagyl and cefepime
were discontinued as all culture data negative to date. Plan to
continue vancomycin for [**7-29**] day course to treat empiric line
infection. Urine culture came back positive for VRE, however,
since patient improved without treatement (ie Linezolid)
initially.
.
After transfer to the floor when she was stable.  On the floor
the Vancomycin was discontinued as the catheter tip culture was
negative.  ID was consulted who suggested broad spectrum
antibiotics if she were to spike.  When pt spiked a temperature
and became hypotensive she was started on Linezolid was started
for presumed VRE infection in the urine.  She will be treated
for total 14 day course.  She was also started on fluconazole
for yeast in the urine, to be treated with fluconazole for total
7 days.  She was given Flagyl for presumed C. Diff. Colitis,
however this was stopped when C. Diff B toxin came back neaative
on [**2159-12-20**].  The tunneled catheter line was changed over a wire
and the tip was also negative.
.
2. Respiratory- Intubated for airway protection due to change in
mental status. Extubated [**12-7**] with no incident.
.
3. ECG changes- Patient had an episode of chest pain during her
hospital stay that was both right and left sided with no
radiation and no associated symptoms. ECG showed new diffuse TWI
in all leads. Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were normal. Echo
was obtained which showed WMA and EF of 35-40%.  Pt was note
started on ASA as she does not tolerate this well, BB was also
not started given SBPs in the 110s.  Statin was also deffered.
She may be started on ASA,BB,statin by PC
