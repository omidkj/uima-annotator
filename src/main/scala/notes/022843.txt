Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7575**]
Chief Complaint:
Status Epilepticus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7739**] is a 70 year-old man with PMH of afib (not on
anticoagulation) s/p pacemaker, HTN, COPD, CAD s/p CABG [**1-/2104**],
DM2 and adrenal insufficiency (on chronic steroids), EtOH w/d
seizures [**3-/2105**] who is transferred from an OSH for status
epilepticus.

Patient was admitted to the neurology service s/p five seizures
last [**Month (only) 958**]. He was intubated for  airway protection/respiratory
support initially in ICU. Seizures did not recur clinically or
on
EEG.  Etiology was thought to be secondary to EtOH withdrawal.
He was discharged with plan to take dilantin monotherapy for 4
weeks anthen discontinue it. (200mg at 8am/8pm and 150mg at
2pm).
Per wife, patient took dilantin for 4 weeks as instructed and
tolerated it well.  He discontinued it as planned.

He was doing well until in [**Month (only) 216**] he had a fall at home after "a
few beers."  He went to the hospital at that time, was told he
was "fine" and sent home.  Since the fall, he had been bed
ridden
and unable to get up without maximal assistance secondary to
pain
in his right hip (which they later found out had multiple
fractures).
In [**Month (only) **], he was at home when he had an episode of flapping
of the right arm, talking "mumbo jumbo, eyes open. This lasted
10-15 minutes.  No associated tongue biting/incontinence.  After
the episode, he was unconscious and "slept for the next 6 days"
in the hospital.  Per wife, his vitals were stable, etc. but he
was asleep.  He did have left upper/lower extremity paralysis
per
wife.  This was found because when his left arm/leg were lifted
up and released, they dropped, whereas on the right he was able
to keep them up for a little bit.  After Mr. [**Known lastname 7739**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] up
gradually, his speech was slurred as well.  These deficits
gradually improved and he was back at baseline on discharge home
after ~2 weeks in the hospital.  During that admission, he was
started on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **].

Since that admission, he has been home but unable to walk around
without assistance.  Thus, wife is sure he has not consumed EtOH
for 8 weeks as he is unable to stand up and get it himself and
she has not given him any.  Today, he was "jittery" and restless
all day. He ate dinner at 8pm.  Later, he was in bed.  His
sister
in law asked him a question and he did not respond.  When she
went over to him, his head was turned to the left, his left eye
was up and out, right eye looking straight ahead.  He was
unresponsive, said "I'm crazy," and then became unresponsive
again.  He had twitching of his abdomen, no tonic/clonic
activity
in upper or lower extremities.  No tongue biting, no urinary
incont.  EMS was called.  He continued to be in this episode and
was nonpresponsive to noxious stimuli.  In the ED at OSH, he
"was
observed to have shaking movements of his face, with
disconjugate
pupils and nystagmus."  He was given 2 mg ativan, followed by
bolus of 1000 mg Keppra (takes keppra 500 mg   [**Hospital1 **] as above).
He
was continuing to have "subtle seizure activity" despite these
interventions, so he was intubated, started on propofol drip.
Notably, had leukocytosis with WBC 15 as well as chest x-ray
consistent with pneumonia. He was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin, and vancomycin given recent hospitalization.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as it was not possible to place patient
on EEG monitoring at OSH.

Per wife, he did not have any fevers/chills, cough, diarrhea,
dysuria prior to this episode.  No recent falls, no EtOH abuse.
