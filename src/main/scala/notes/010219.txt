FINAL REPORT


HISTORY: 64-year-old man with history of mediastinal
re-exploration with
increasing left arm edema. PICC line in left upper arm. Evaluate
for DVT.

FINDINGS: Normal respiratory variation and waveforms and
compressibility is
seen in the left internal jugular vein. Normal waveforms
demonstrated in the
left subclavian vein, and the PICC line is seen within its
lumen. The line is
seen extending through the left axillary vein, and there is
normal
compressibility and respiratory variation within this vein.

THE PICC line terminates in the antecubital fossa. There is
normal
compressibility and flow demonstrated in the left cephalic vein.
There is
normal compressibility and flow demonstrated in the basilic and
brachial
veins. Mid portion of the brachial veins could not be assessed
secondary to
overlying dressing.

IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis identified.
