History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77792**] is a 75 with chronic respiratory failure s/p
tracheostomy, type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease s/p
right BKA, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and ESRD on dialysis who
presented on [**2150-11-3**] from his chronic rehab facility with
hypotension to the 70s systolic with associated cough and sputum
production. Since [**2150-11-3**] he has had multiple ICU transfers for
hypotension and somnolence.
.
On DOA on [**2150-11-3**], he presented with BP of 50/33 and it was
presumed to be sepsis from large known sacral decubitus ulcer
which was felt to be infected.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
concern for sepsis.  He was in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from [**2150-11-3**] to
[**2150-11-26**]. In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he had a broad infectious workup.  Multiple
blood cultures were negative.  Both sputum and urine cultures
were positive for acinetobacter.  He was treated with a
prolonged course of daptomycin, meropenem and PO vancomycin.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**2150-11-26**] prior to transfer to
the floor.  While in the ICU his blood pressures were
persistently in the 70s to 80s systolic but he was afebrile and
was noted to be mentating appropriately.  His blood pressures
were noted to be particularly sensitive to narcotic pain
medications. He was followed closely by the renal, infectious
disease and plastic surgery services.  He initially required
CVVH given his labile blood pressures but was ultimately
transitioned back to intermittent hemodialysis.  His back wound
was debrided on multiple occassions by plastic surgery.  His
back wound was noted to be consistently contaminated by fecal
material despite flexiseal use.  Diverting colostomy was
recommended but was declined by the patient.  He was transferred
to the floor on [**2150-11-26**] for further management.
.
On [**2150-11-29**] he was transferred back to the MICU for hypotension.
He was not febrile, new cultures failed to reveal a source. He
was started back on daptomycin, meropenem and PO vancomycin.  He
also received stress dose steroids. His hypotension resolved
with this regimen. He was transferred back to the floor with
blood pressures in the 90s to 110s systolic. The patient did
well on the floor until [**12-8**] when 2 hours after receiving 10 mg
oxycodone to control sacral decub pain in setting of dressing
change he became unresponsive.
Narcan did imporve his alertness but the medical staff was
unable to obtain reliable vital measurements and in setting of
worsening productive sputum and worsening leukocytosis, patient
was transferred to ICU were he was monitored for 2 days.  The
patient returned to the medicine floor on [**12-10**]. However, on
[**12-12**] he again became hypotensive and returned to the ICU, again
likely multifactorial. Midodrine was restarted and uptitrated to
15mg tid. He received one unit of PRBCs with hemodialysis for
colloid volume resuscitation. He was transferred back to the
floor on [**12-14**].
.
On review of systems he does not note any pain/discomfort
anywhere. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, leg pain.

Past Medical History:
# DM2
# CRI (baseline 2.5)- recently started on HD
# CHF - EF 50-55% [**3-24**]
# Trached and Vent Dependent [**1-18**] PNA in [**12-24**]
hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, bronchoscopy on [**9-10**].
He diffuse airway edema consistent with volume overload. There
were no significant secretions and a full survey of the airways
reveals all airways were patent without any endobronchial
lesions. His trach was
felt to be in appropriate position without any obstruction.
There was no tracheobronchomalacia.
# PNA [**4-23**] (Stenotrophomonas - Bactrim sensitive)
and Acenitobacter ([**Last Name (un) 36**] to Unasyn, Gent and Tobra, resistant to

FQ, ceftaz, cefepime)
# MRSA PNA
# ESBL Klebsiella UTI [**3-24**]
# Morbid obesity
# Afib on Coumadin
# Hypercholesterolemia
# Coccyx Ulcers

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with bilateral small pleural effusions,
left greater than right. Retrocardiac opacity may represent a
combination of atelectasis and pleural effusions. Cannot rule
out pneumonia. Followup is recommended.

FOOT 2 VIEWS LEFT PORT Study Date of [**2150-11-4**] 10:04 AM
FINDINGS: No previous images. There has been resection of the
phalanges of
the fourth and fifth digits as well as a substantial portion of
the fifth
metatarsal in a patient with vascular calcification consistent
with diabetes. Specifically, no evidence of erosion of the
calcaneus, though there is evidence of an adjacent ulcer. Small
posterior calcaneal spur.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2150-11-9**]
The left atrial volume is increased. The left atrium is dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-4-4**],
mild symmetric LVH is present, left ventricular cavity size is
smaller and overall left ventricular systolic function has
improved. The degree of mitral regurgitation has increased
slightly. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension can be
seen on the current study.
