Ms. [**Known lastname 24483**] has had the chief complaint of nausea and
vomiting for two days.  She is a 67-year-old woman with a
past medical history of congestive heart failure, ejection
fraction approximately 17% with multiple medical problems,
including myocardial infarction status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2155**], as well as peripheral vascular disease,
status post left lower extremity bypass graft, peptic ulcer
disease, anemia, osteomyelitis, status post left
calcanectomy, left foot and recurrent cellulitis of lower
extremities.  She presented to the Emergency Department with
nausea and vomiting x2 days.  Emesis was biliary, positive
nausea, vomiting, after eating.  Fingerstick showed blood

The patient was alert and oriented x3, but the blood pressure
was noted to be 83/28 in the Emergency Department.  She was

her blood pressure.  She was then given 1 liter of normal
saline without increase in blood pressure.  The patient was
then started on Dopa 5 mcg with increased blood pressure
100/60.  The patient was initially given ceftriaxone and
Flagyl for broad coverage in the Emergency Department.  The
patient also received Zofran and droperidol for nausea and
vomiting.

The patient was admitted to SICU at the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].  She was
found to have a urinary tract infection with Escherichia coli
greater than 100,000 colonies forming in it.  Urinary tract
infection and gram positive cocci in her blood, 2 of 4
bottles, which at the current time have been identified as
being coagulase negative.  Final identification and
sensitivities are pending.  The patient ruled in for non Q
wave myocardial infarction as well, having CPKs of 197 and
troponin of 4.3, peak troponin of 11.6.

SICU COURSE:  Dopamine drip was turned off on the 29th.
Blood pressure was systolic blood pressure to 120s.  Troponin
trended down to 7.4 and CK to 150 in both and continued to
trend downward.  The patient was hemodynamically stable, had
a T-max of 100.7 and at the time of leaving the SICU of 99.
The patient was transferred out of the SICU onto the floor on
the [**9-13**].

ADMISSION LABS:  Sodium 134, potassium 4.8, chloride 94,
bicarbonate 24, BUN 36, creatinine 2.0.  White count 16.2,
94.9 neutrophils, 11.9 hemoglobin, 35.1 hematocrit.  INR 1.2,
PT 12.9, PTT 26.3.  Urine cultures - Escherichia coli greater
than 100,000 on [**2167-7-12**].  Urinalysis had moderate leukocyte
esterase, 11 to 20 white blood cells, few bacteria.  CKs were
197, 232, 204 and then 150.  Troponin 10.6, 11.6 and then
7.4.  Digoxin level was 1.3.

DISCHARGE DATE LABS:  White blood cell count 5.9, neutrophils

ADMISSION IMAGING:  Chest x-ray at the time of admission -
stable cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, linear
markings in lingula consistent with atelectasis.
Electrocardiogram - sinus bradycardia 63 beats per minute, PR
prolongation, left axis deviation, AV conduction delay.  Left
ventricular hypertrophy with poor R-wave compression, no
acute changes from previous studies with exception of
increased ST depression, T-wave #1 with slight increase and
ST depression and T-wave inversion in AVL suggesting possible
lateral ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a
past medical history of myocardial infarction, status post
coronary artery bypass graft, peripheral vascular disease,
status post left bypass graft, congestive heart failure with
an ejection fraction of 17%, diabetes mellitus,
cerebrovascular accident x2, lower extremity cellulitis, foot
ulcer on left foot, osteomyelitis of left calcaneus,
spontaneous left calcanectomy, tracheostomy, chronic renal
insufficiency who presented to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital
with decreased blood pressure resistant to intravenous fluids
with gram negative rods/Escherichia coli and urinary tract
infection with greater than 100,000 colonies forming and
positive cocci and clusters at this time, coagulase negative,
pairs and in clusters in blood cultures was a rule in non
Q-wave myocardial infarction, post troponin, negative MB
fraction of CKs, coronary artery disease, non Q-wave
myocardial infarction.  Troponins and CKs are trending down
from peak on the [**9-12**].  The patient was initially on
Lovenox after the acute event.  The patient was continued on
Ecotrin 325 po qd, Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid which was
increased to 25 mg po bid.

The patient is not and should not receive ACE inhibitor.  She
does not tolerate them due to chronic renal insufficiency.
She is also receiving Lipitor 20 mg po q hs.  The patient has
sublingual nitrates prn, is not receiving po nitrates,
Isordil on a regular basis due to slightly low blood
pressure.

Congestive heart failure - The patient is on 40 mg of Lasix
po qd.

Pulmonary - The patient has been saturating well, 96% on 2
liters and weaning her off O2.

Renal - chronic renal insufficiency - The patient's
creatinine has improved since her admission.

Gastrointestinal - Protonix 40 mg po qd

Endocrinology - The patient on NPH insulin currently, to at
full dose at 18 units a.m. and 7 units q hs, will increase to
25 in a.m. and keep the same 7 q hs.

Intravenous ceftriaxone 1 gm intravenous qd for a total of
two weeks.  The patient requires 11 more days of treatment
after discharge for urinary tract infection.  Vancomycin -
The patient has received doses on the 28th, 29th and 30th.
The patient received 1 gm intravenous.  Level was checked on
the 30th.  It was 16.4.  Her ..............  estimated to be
30 at the time.  Her renal function is improving and requires
rechecking of the trough level for dosing.  That level would
be checked here at the hospital at 4 p.m. a half an hour
before her next scheduled dose.  If the pa
