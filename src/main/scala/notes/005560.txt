Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, elevated creatinine


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization with cardiac biopsy
Pacemaker evaluation with atrial and [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular lead
placement


History of Present Illness:
62M with hx of dilated CM (EF 35%), A fib on coumadin, AICD [**2183**]
for non-sustained VT, PV, hyperferritinitis, COPD, irritable
bowel syndrome with chronic diarrhea, presents with hypotension
and increased creatinine.  Earlier today he presented to an
outpatient clinic for scheduled phlebotomy to treat
hyperferritinemia.  His BP was found to be 86/56, well below his
baseline of 100s/70s.  He was asymptomatic.  Phlebotomy was
cancelled and he was sent to the emergency department for
evaluation.
.
For the last several months he has been followed by his primary
care, gastroenterology, and cardiology for increased fatigue,
hypotension, and irritible bowel syndrome with significant
diarrhea.  Since [**Month (only) 116**] he has had [**4-21**] loose stools daily,
non-bloody, some greasy.  Occasional blood on toilet paper [**1-14**]
hemorrhoids.  Workup including EGD ([**7-2**]), colonoscopy ([**7-2**])
negative for clear causality.  Multiple medications,
particularly anti-hypertensives, have been discontinued and
started in the last few months in an attempt to relieve any
medication effect exacerbating his diarrhea. Of note, his
metoprolol was increased from 25mg daily to 100mg daily one
month ago and he has felt weak ever since. He presented with
new-onset A fib in [**2195-4-12**] and was started on coumadin.
.
In the last week, he has had several episodes of diaphoresis, a
chronic issue now exacerbated.  He complains of reduced
appetitite and reduced PO intake, partially due to fatigue and
partially due to feeling full.  He denies nausea or vomiting.
He complains of mild lower back pain of several months duration,
no recent changes.  Denies CP, SOB, palpitations, abd pain,
headache, dizziness, lightheadedness.  Increased urinary urgency
in the last few weeks, no change in frequency or quality of
urine.
.
In the ED, he initially presented with BP 84/64 and HR 118.  He
was given fluids (total 3L) and remained hypotensive to 85/60.
Lab values revealed a Cr of 2.1, significantly elevated from
last known value in [**2194-10-13**] of 0.8.  He denied CP, SOB,
palpitations, abdominal pain, vomiting, HA, dizziness, or
lightheadedness.
.
In the ICU,  he initially presented with BP 109/78, HR 109.  He
was comfortable and complained of no chest or abdominal pain,
nor shortness of breath.  He denies any symptoms associated with
his hypotension and asserts that his cardiologist is comfortable
with BP in the 100s/70s.
.
In the ICU, patient's hypotension resolved with holding of his
home metoprolol and losartan. He was then called out to the
floors, where he remained normotensive but went into persistent
AFib with RVR in the 130s-140s (at best he was in the
110s-120s). Digoxin, Metoprolol succinate and Diltiazem were all
given with no success decreasing rates below 110s-120s.
.
On [**7-16**], TTE was done to evaluate for new cardiac dysfunction,
and showed new extreme LV restrictive filling pattern. This is
suspected to be related to possible hemochromatosis, as patient
has polycythemia, high hematocrit and high ferritin. Initially
had been planning to follow this outpatient at heart failure
clinic, but because patient has been persistently tachycardic
there is now concern for connection between poor rate control
and restrictive physiology. Last night, he was slightly volume
overloaded (JVD, crackles) b/c holding diuretics, so he received
40mg Lasix. On transfer, he is on room air, BP 116/70, with HR
121.
