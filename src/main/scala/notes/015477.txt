Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Extubation


History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt. is a 61 yo w/h/o DM1, s/p cadaveric kidney
transplant([**2175**]), h/o CVA and chronic aspiration with recent
admission to MICU in [**8-15**] for aspiration PNA. At this time he
was treated with Zosyn/Vancomycin/Ciprofloxacin for presumed
HAP. He also showed some evidence of pulmonary edema and was
initially treated w/ Lasix, however he developed a rash on his
chest and UE and required ethycrinic acid. Tracheostomy and PEG
were placed prior to discharge.
A blood cx from [**8-13**] drawn from a PICC line placed [**8-1**] grew CNS
and pt was discahrged on a 2 week course of Vancomycin.
.
Pt presented to ED from home with respiratory distress. He was
started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for concern for
multifocal PNA. Femoral line was placed after multiple attempts
at central access. He was intubated in the ER, subsequently
dropped his pressure with propofol and briefly required a
dopamine gtt. He was also given glucagon 5mg IVP. Initial vitals
in ED showed RR 44 and O2 87% RA. Vitals in the ED, BP 130/63,
HR 58. 100% AC. Started on fentanyl and versed for sedation.
.
On arrival to MICU, the pt's wife is present at the bedside. She
reports that the patient has been home from rehab for the past
3-4 weeks and doing well. Over the past 3 days the pt has had
episodes of dyspnea while laying flat, which resolved with
sitting, occurring in the evenings. Denies fever or cough.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
The patient recently recovered from multifocal PNA requiring
long intubation and trach placement. He had been doing well at
home s/p trach removal. Now presenting with acute onset of
respiratory distress. No witnessed aspiration event. CXR with
multifocal opacities concerning for edema vs infiltrate.  While
on invasive ventilation had versed and fentanyl for sedation. A
diagnostic bronchoscopy was preformed to evaluate and to obtain
sputum culture. Pt chronically immunosuppressed given kidney
transplant, has been on PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 6187**].  Pt with evidence of
volume overload on exam, diuresis was attempted with ethacrynic
acid as the pt has history of lasix allergy. A TTE was performed
to evaluate for worsening AR/MR or new focal wall motion
abnormality as cause for CHF. The TTE was a limited study, and
MR could be exacerbating [**Last Name 3545**] problem, however, no evidence
of worsening by Echo. There was no evidence of infection by
sputum, fever, or WBC and bronch appearance was consistent with
pulmonary edema. The patient was extubated without complication
and was breathing comfortably on room air. The pt was
periodically agitated despite seroquel 75mg. His wife stated
patient has had paradoxical response to haldol in the past,
given zyprexa SL with good result.  Upon arrival to the floor,
the patient had one episode where he felt subjectively short of
breath with no desaturation that was resolved with positioning
in a seated position, and another episode which was related to
aspiration of his breakfast which resolved with suctioning,
sitting, and O2 cannula therapy.  The patient has been
saturating in the high 90's on room air since.  In addition, the
patient has been given ethacrynic acid IV to maintain fluid
negative status.  On discharge, pt's oxygen saturation was
95-98% on room air.  He was breathing comfortably without the
sensation of shortness of breath.  He was no longer requiring
diuretics and Is/Os were kept even.

2. CKD s/p cadaveric renal transplant:
Pt was continued on his current regimen of tacrolimus,
prednisone and cellcept. His Cr remained stable at 1.0 and 1.1
during his course.  Renal was following and tacrolimus dose was
increased to 4mg [**Hospital1 **].  Tacrolimus levels were followed and pt
was discharged on Tacrolimus 2mg PO BID.  Creatinine remained
stable throughout admission and but increased to 1.4 on day of
discharge.  Patient was instructed to have labs draws as
outpatient with results faxed to primary care physician and
nephrologist.

3. Hypertension:
BP meds were held initially given recent hypotension with
intubation. HCTZ was started for [**Doctor Last Name 1567**] diuresis. Patient was
started on half of home dose of metoprolol. Lisinopril was not
restarted due to concerns for worsening creatinine on day of
discharge.

4. DM1:
Patient's home regimen of NPH and insulin sliding scale. Blood
sugars initially ranged into the high 200's low 300's after
transfer to the floor; however, the patient was placed on
bedtime lantus with HISS, and morning NPH.  FS's down into mid
to high 100's.  Patient will be discharged on home regimen of
NPH [**Hospital1 **] with lispro Sliding Scale.

5. CAD s/p CABG:
The patient has extensive cardiac disease, as he is s/p NSTEMI
and V-fib arrest in [**2169**] and CABG [**2170**]. No evidence of ischemia
on EKG. CE enzymes were cycled and negative.
