Service:  ACOVE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft, abdominal aortic aneurysm
status post repair, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, and renal cell carcinoma status post left
nephrectomy, transferred from [**Hospital3 15174**] for
further management of a right adrenal hemorrhage.  The
patient was visiting his son in central [**State 350**] and
developed the sudden onset of right flank pain on the morning
of [**6-23**], with radiation to his epigastrium.

At [**Hospital1 **], he was noted to have a blood pressure
of 168/107 with an INR of 2.3.  CT scan of the abdomen
revealed a right adrenal hemorrhage.  His INR was corrected
with 6 units of fresh frozen plasma and 2.5 mg of Vitamin K,
which brought it down to 1.4.  His hematocrit dropped from 41
to 28; the patient was transfused two units of packed red
blood cells.  His hematocrit was subsequently stable in the
low 30s.  Repeat CT scan on [**6-24**], revealed no change in the
size of the hemorrhage.  The patient was noted to be in
congestive heart failure with decreased oxygen saturation and
edema on chest x-ray.

The congestive heart failure was presumed to be secondary to
high volume blood products resuscitation.  The patient was
diuresed with intravenous Lasix.  The patient's hypertension
was difficult to control and he was started on Nipride,
Hydralazine, Norvasc, Minoxidil, Toprol XL and Aldomet.  The
patient's blood pressures typically run at approximately
180/120 at home.  He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient resides in [**State 531**].  He is a
retired firefighter.  He has a positive tobacco history and
smoked approximately two pack per day for the past 50 years.
He denies any alcohol use.  He has five children and nine
grandchildren.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a blood pressure of
180/83; pulse of 71; respiratory rate of 24; saturation 92%
on room air; he was afebrile.  In general, he was an alert,
mildly dyspneic gentleman in no acute distress.  His pupils
equally round and reactive to light.  His extraocular
movements are intact.  His mucous membranes were moist.  His
oropharynx was clear.  His neck was supple without
lymphadenopathy or any visible jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular examination:  He had a regular rate and rhythm
without any murmurs.  On respiratory examination, he had
diffuse expiratory wheezing bilaterally.  His abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
His extremities were warm without cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.

LABORATORY:  On transfer, the patient had a white blood cell
count of 7.6, hematocrit of 32.3, platelet count of 108.  He
had a sodium of 137, potassium of 3.8, chloride of 101, CO2
of 27, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.6, glucose of 81.  He had a
magnesium of 1.9, phosphate of 3.4, albumin of 3.4 and INR of
1.2.  PTT of 33.3.

He had an EKG which revealed normal sinus rhythm at 80.  He
was noted to have non-specific T wave inversions laterally in
V2 through V6, unchanged from the prior cardiogram
[**2103-6-23**].

Chest x-ray revealed no evidence of congestive heart failure
or pneumonia.  He was noted to have findings consistent with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as a
questionable mediastinal widening secondary to a vascular
structure.

He had a renal ultrasound which revealed a right kidney
mildly enlarged but with normal echo texture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69 year old male with a history
of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft, hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm status post
repair, and renal cell carcinoma status post left
nephrectomy, who presents with a right adrenal hemorrhage in
the setting of an INR of 2.3.

His hospital course up to this point has been notable for
persistent malignant hypertension necessitating a Nipride
drip and multiple oral agents.

1.  Endocrine:  With regard to the adrenal mass, we are
uncertain of the cause; however, his hematocrit was noted to
remain stable throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.
Furthermore, he did not have any evidence of adrenal
insufficiency.  One possibility on our differential was that
the patient may have a tumor which resulted in the adrenal
hemorrhage.  He subsequently had an MRI of his abdomen to
evaluate for possible mass abutting the adrenal gland.

The MRI revealed a focal collection consistent with the
previously noted hemorrhage.  We held the patient's Coumadin
given this acute event.  At this time, we remain uncertain
about the cause of his adrenal hemorrhage.

2.  Hypertension:  We started the patient on a regimen of
Labetalol, Hydralazine and Norvasc.  This resulted in
adequate blood pressure control.  Our initial goal was a
systolic blood pressure of approximately 150 mm of Mercury
given the patient's baseline systolic blood pressure of 180
mm of Mercury.  The patient tolerated this regimen well
without any difficulties.  Toward the end of his hospital
stay, we gently titrated up the Labetalol in order to
maximize blood pressure control.

We performed an MRA of the patient's renal arteries in order
to evaluate for potential secondary cause of malignant
hypertension.  The patient was found to have a 70% renal
artery stenosis on the right side.  In addition, his right
kidney was noted to be of normal size and, therefore, is
likely viable.  The patient is likely a good candidate for
angioplasty.  However, given his recent hemorrhage, he is not
currently a candidate for the anti-coagulation necessary for
this procedure, therefore, we will control his blood pressure
with oral agents and he will follow as an outpatient for
further management of his renal artery stenosis.

3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient was
noted to be dyspneic with limited ambulation.  He had
expiratory wheezing on examination.  We initially treated him
with a five-day course of Zithromax for possible bronchitis.
We subsequently ended up starting the patient on a Prednisone
taper.  He tolerated the Prednisone quite well and had a
marked improvement in his respiratory status.  He was
continued on his Metered-Dose Inhalers and had instructions
by Respiratory Therapy for the appropriate use of the
inhalers.

4.  Cardiovascular:  With regards to his paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, the patient was noted to be in sinus rhythm
during his hospital stay.  We have held his Coumadin given
his adrenal hemorrhage.  We recommend that this be held for
the time being and that it be started in several weeks with
caution as an outpatient.

5.  Vascular:  during his stay, the patient was noted to have
an asymmetric lower extremity edema, left greater than right.
He had a lower extremity ultrasound which revealed dilatation
of the right common femoral artery to 2.4 cm with an
atheromatous plaque within.  The patient was s
