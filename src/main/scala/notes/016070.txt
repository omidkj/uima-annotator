.
Recently admitted [**Date range (1) 35547**] s/p fall with dehydration and UTI,
treated with 10 days of ceftriaxone. He was readmitted [**6-15**]
-[**6-27**] with fever, N/V, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and
diagnosed with C. diff (Abd CT showed pan-colitis). He was
discharged on 14 day course of IV Flagyl (due to difficulty

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Sepsis: In the MICU, the pt was found to be in septic shock,
with blood cultures and PICC line culture positive for MRSA on
[**6-30**].  On admission, pt was hypoxic and in respiratory failure.
He was intubated on [**6-30**] in the ICU and was subsequently
extubated on [**7-3**].  TTE [**7-4**] showed no evidence of vegetations.
Sputum cx also grew MRSA and CXR showed RML pneumonia.  PICC
line was removed and a L SC line was placed.  The pt was started
on IV vancomycin 1g [**Hospital1 **].  Negative blood cultures on [**7-3**].  He
was found to be adrenally insufficient by [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim testing and
was given 7 days of fludrocort/hydrocort per our sepsis
protocol.  Although he initally required pressors and large
amounts of fluid for his hypotension, the pt was quickly weaned
off levophed in the MICU and was able to maintain adequate blood
pressure throughout the remainder of his stay. On transfer to
the floor, the pt's vancomycin was stopped as he was also being
covered with linezolid, which has bacteriostatic activity
against MRSA.  Subsequent blood culture has been negative.
Linezolid will be continued for a total of 14 days (today is day
6).

2. Diarrhea - Given his recent history of severe C diff, the
patient was continued on IV flagyl and PO vanco started during
his last admission throughout this admission as well (today is
d22/28 total). All C diff toxin A studies this admission have
come back negative.  Currently, C diff toxin B is pending.  An
Abd/Pelvis CT on [**7-1**] demostrated an evolving diffuse colitis
with interval increase in pericolonic inflammatory stranding and
free fluid. This was believed to be lagging behind the patient's
clinical picture, which was generally improving over time.  A
rectal tube was placed in the MICU for decompression and was
removed upon transfer to the floor.  On the day prior to
discharge, rifaximin was added to the patient's antibiotic
regimen for further coverage of C Diff given our high suspicion
regardless of negative toxin screens. (today d2/10)  The pt's
abdominal pain and tenderness have resolved. The pt's diarrhea
markedly decreased over the course of his stay on the floor.  He
tolerated a liquid diet without problem.  GI was formally
consulted and they agreed that the patient was improving with a
negative abdominal exam and therefore required no further
workup. Antibiotics should be continued as an outpatient, as
listed above, and the patient's diet can be advanced as
tolerated. When he is taking good PO, his TPN can be stopped as
it is only for supplementation. Please follow Cdiff toxin A and
B as an outpatient. If negative, pt may stop his antibiotics as
planned above.

3. UTI: Urine cultures on [**6-30**] grew VRE and the pt was started
on linezolid. Subsequent cultures have been negative. Linezolid
will be used to cover both his VRE and his MRSA - requires 14
day course given bacteremia (today day 6).

4.  R iliac thrombus - pt has been anticoagulated throughout his
stay with a heparin drip and goal PTT 60-100. Given hypoxia, CTA
in the MICU was negative for PE.  On the day prior to admission
the patient's heparin was d/c-ed and he was started on a loading
dose of coumadin 5mg x 1 to be followed by coumadin 2mg qhs as
an outpt. He was also started on Lovenox which can be
discontinued when the patient is at goal IN
