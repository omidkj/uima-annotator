History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 31930**] is a 61 year old male with a history of coronary
artery disease s/p MI and CABG, chronic systolic heart failure,
recurrent VT s/p ICD placement and atrial fibrillation who
presents from home with recurrent ICD firing.  Patient reports
being in his usual state of health until 3 PM on the day prior
to admission.  He stopped taking his sotalol approximately 2
weeks prior to admission for unclear reasons.  He did not
discuss this with his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Over the past
few weeks since discontinuing this [**Last Name (STitle) 4085**] he has noted
decreased exercise tolerance and worsening dyspnea on exertion.
He typically can walk half a block but now can only walk around
his home.  He has not been experiencing any fevers or chills.
He has not had any episodes of chest pain.  He denies worsening
orthopnea or PND but does endorse worsening nocturia.  He denies
worsening lower extremity edema.  At 3 PM on the day prior to
admission his ICD fired.  He has had firings before and he
denies any precipitating events.  His ICD has since fired 8
times in 12 hours.  He has never had repeated firings before.
He decided to come to the emergency room.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 97.8 BP: 150/98 HR: 73 RR: 18
O2: 99% on RA.  EKG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid
response in the 140s with intermittent demand pacing,
intraventricular conduction delay left bundle branch block
pattern, no gross ischemic changes, no change from prior dated
[**2159-8-24**]. Two episodes of vtach in the ED without firing.  EP
recommended rate control of his RVR and some lasix.  He received
diltiazem 10 mg IV x 1 and lasix 80 mg IV x 1.
.
On review of systems he denies fevers, chills, cough,
congestion, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain.  He denies chest
pain, orthopnea, PND.  He endorses worsening dyspnea on exertion
and nocturia.  He has significant lower extremity edema on exam
but denies worsening.

Past Medical History:

implanted [**2150-9-18**].  The atrial lead is a Guidant 4464
also implanted in [**2150-8-30**].  His LV lead is a [**Company 1543**] 4193
implanted in [**2153-7-30**] and the ICD device was implanted in
[**2158-3-30**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL: AOriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were pink, no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.
NECK: +JVD
CARDIAC: irregularly irregular rhythm, tachy. No m/r/g.
LUNGS: Resp were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. bilateral
crackles half way up lung fields. ICD pocket w/o erythema,
warmth or any sign of infection
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits. erythema on L anterior
leg, no drainage or tenderness. healing ulcer on L foot.


Pertinent Results:
EKG: Afib RVR in the 140s with intermittent demand pacing, left
bundle branch block, no gross ischemic changes, no change from
prior dated [**2159-8-24**].

CXR [**2159-9-14**]: A right pectoral pacemaker power pack is
redemonstrated, with unchanged position of right atrial pacer
and right ventricular defibrillator leads on the single AP view.
Also old abandoned AICD and epicardial leads are unchanged,
projecting over the right and left heart, respectively. The
patient is status post CABG. Other lines projecting over the
patient are probably external to the patient. Right internal
jugular central venous catheter has been removed.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is relatively unchanged. There
is again increase in perihilar and bibasilar opacities, probably
representing pulmonary edema, although underlying infection
cannot be excluded. The upper lungs are relatively clear.
Appearance is not dissimilar to that seen on [**2159-8-24**]. The right
lateral sulcus is excluded, but there may be tiny bilateral
pleural
effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old male with a h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in [**2144**], chronic
systolic heart failure (EF 20%), recurrent VT s/p ICD placement
and atrial fibrillation admitted now for recurrent ICD firing
after not taking home Sotalol for 2 weeks.
.
# Afib/VT: Pt has Afib, h/o VT, with several episodes of VT the
night PTA s/p shocks. On admission, pt was in Afib, with
occasional pacing, hemodynamically stable and rec'd Dilt for
rate control in the ED.  On the morning of the 17th, he became
hemodynamically unstable with afib and RVR, and a code blue was
called during which the patient was intubated, shocked, and
administered a dose of amiodarone. On arrival to the CCU, the
patient's vital signs were 93, 101/52, 19, 88% on vent. He was
intubated, sedated, in sinus and intermittently paced and
hemodynamically stable. His labs returned with a K of 6.2 and
glucose of 48. Calcium gluconate, glucose, insulin, albuterol
and sodium bicarbonate were administered. Fentanyl and midazolam
were started for sedation. He was also continued on IV
amiodarone drip to maintain sinus rhythm, despite history of
hypothyroidism with amiodarone.  He was stable after
self-extubation and was seen by EP who re-adjusted pacer
settings.  He was started on amiodarone with good success and
transferred back to the floor on [**9-17**]. Pt remained in sinus
rhythm with intermittent pacing. Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
was eventually dc'd, and since pt has an elev INR at baseline,
it was decided not to start Coumadin as it would be difficult to
monitor. Pt was continued on Amiodarone 400mg daily to maintain
sinus rhythm as per EP recs.  Home Sotalol has been dc'd. On
telemetry,  pt continued to have frequent PVCs, NSVT. Also, pt
was started on Digoxin at cautious dose of 0.125mg every other
day since pt also on Amiodarone.
.
# Acute systolic heart failure: pt is volume overloaded per
exam, elev BNP and CXR, likely [**1-1**] to poor diet control and med
non compliance (dig level low).  He improved with aggressive
diuresis with IV lasix, later switched to home Lasix dose.  His
home simvastatin, midodrine, and spironolactone were continued.
Digoxin was temporarily held for renal failure but restarted at
a more cautious dose prior to discharge. The reason why the pt
was no on an ACE-I was not clear.  Starting ACE-I during
admission was considered but decided to defer it to his
outpatient cardiologist.
.
# Hypothyroidism: [**1-1**] to Amiodarone toxicity, currently
asymptomatic.  His home levothyroxine was continued. Will have
to rechec
