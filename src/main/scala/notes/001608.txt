This is an 83 year old male who was in his usual state of health
until this morning when he awoke with shortness of breath and
epigastric "pressure".  He called 911 and was brought to [**Hospital **]

CXR ([**9-10**]):
pulmonary edema

ECHO ([**9-10**]):
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and moderate
global
hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root and ascending aorta are
mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of
[**2115-5-13**], left ventricular systolic function is now reduced -
35% - (global) and mild mitral regurgitation is present.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old man with a history of atrial fibrillation s/p
cardioversion and maintained on sotolol and coumadin (recently
therapeutic INR), presented to OSH in afib with respiratory
distress, HTN (210/110) and mild tachycardia (90-100s).  Sx
improved with diuresis.

1.  Cardiovascular
-- CAD: There was no evidence of significant CAD from a cardiac
catheterization in [**1-30**].  Serial EKGs did not show any
concerning ST-T wave changes.  Cardiac enzymes were negative x3.
 The patient's LDL was high at 127, so he was started on
atorvastatin 20mg daily.
-- Rate/rhythm: The patient presented in atrial fibrillation
with rates in the 70-90s.  He was initially diagnosed with afib
4 years ago, and at the time of initial diagnosis had similar
symptoms to the ones that brought him to the hospital this time
(shortness of breath and fatigue).  He is s/p cardioversion and
maintained on sotolol and coumadin.  He has been therapeutic on
his coumadin for at least the past one month, and ECHO shows no
thrombus in the LV.  Therefore, initially the plan was to DC
cardiovert him, but overnight on his first hospital day he
spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm.  Approximately 16 hours
later he returned to a fib with rates in the 60-70s, and
converted spontaneously again after that.  He was asymptomatic
as he was in and out of afib.  He was continued on sotolol and
coumadin per outpatient doses.  He was discharged in sinus
rhythm, with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor which he was going to
telephone in twice a day until he followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**]
in two weeks ([**9-27**] at 11:30am).
-- Pump: The patient's last EF at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**4-30**] was 60%; EF done
as OSH today was estimated to be 20%.  Repeated on admission to
[**Hospital1 18**] and revealed an EF of 35%. The cause of the decreasing EF
was unclear - tachycardia associated cardiomyopathy vs. viral
cardiomyopathy vs. stunning.  The patient presented in pulmonary
edema per exam and CXR, and was bolused with Lasix IV 40 twice a
day with good urine output, and was transitioned over to 40mg po
twice a day.  Spironolactone was also added to his regimen.  He
was negative approximately 4.5 liters during his stay.  He was
discharged home on 20mg lasix PO as well as spironolactone
12.5mg daily.  He was initially continued on Lisinopril 5mg
daily per outpatient regimen, and this was increased to 10mg
daily.  The patient tolerated these medication additions and
changes well, his blood pressure remained in the 110-130s
systolic.  He will follow up with his primary care physician
next week ([**9-19**] at 9:15am) to get his INR checked as well as to
assess how he is tolerating his medications.  He has a follow up
appointment in the [**Hospital 1902**] clinic on [**10-21**] at 9AM.
2.  Respiratory: The patient arrived from OSH on a 100% facemask
with sats in the high 90s.  That night he was transitioned to 4L
NC without difficulty and continued to maintain sats in the high
90s.  He was able to be weaned off of oxygen over the next
couple of days as his diuresis progressed.  This respiratory
distress was presumed to be due to his volume overload.  He was
discharged with sats in the mid 90s on room air.
