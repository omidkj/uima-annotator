History of Present Illness:
59 year old male with recurrent squamous cell lung cancer, now
C1D10 of gemcitabine, last dose on [**2152-4-20**] who p/w fever and
dizziness. He called the oncology fellow tonight w/ temp to
102.3. Onc fellow recommended he come to ER for counts to r/o
febrile neutropenia. He reports that he had fever and rigors
with chemotherapy 3 days ago, was told to take tylenol. The
following day hie was afebrile. The day of admission, he felt
weak, went to sleepi nthe afternoon and t hen awoke with fever
102.3., no chills or rigors. He states that he has been pushing
fluids and has had nl urine output, btu has had [**Month (only) **] appetitie.
He denies any change in cough or sputum production ?????? only basein
occaisonal thin white sputum- Sob at baseline, no V/D, no abd
pain, no dysuria, no rashes, no oral ulcers.

In the ED: He was initially stable with SBP 116/76 but then
developed tachycardiac to 120's and eventually hypotension to
SBP 70's. He was given a central line -which had to be replaced
3 times due to curling of the line. He also was given 6liters NS
with improvement of HR to 100's but SBP remained 85/40. Neo was
started. CVP was 10 and UOP 1870. He was mentating well. He was
also given Vancomycin and Cefepime. In addition, no lateral ST
depressions were noted in V4-V6; cardiac enzymes negative in the
ED.

Intial vitals 116/76 88 76 22 100%2L then 101 130 75/51

Of Note, he was discharged from the CCU one month ago after
being admitted for aflutter with RVR. The resolved spontaneously
and his medications were not changed.


Past Medical History:

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
======================
ONC: squamous cell lung cancer T3, N2 s/p L pneumonectomy [**2-/2151**]
after chemo and XRT; bronchoscopy on [**12-22**] revealed erythema and
abnormal appearance in the L bronchial stump suggesting
recurrent disease. Recent PET shows some FDG avidity along the
pneumonectomy suture line with a comment about a foci of avidity
in the AP window area. There is also circumferential uptake
around the pneumonectomy cavity. There is also a note of poor
anatomic delineation without a contrast CT. There was also FDG
avidity between the right atrial appendage and the left
ventricular outflow track without anatomic correlate. No
definite bony lesions, no subdiaphragmatic lesions. He is being
considered for radiation therapy
- He started weekly Taxotere on [**2152-2-3**], and completed
two
cycles.
- C1D10 of gemcitabine, last dose on [**2152-4-20**]
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
====================
- a-flutter s/p ablation in [**11/2151**]; not anticoagulated [**1-17**]
bleeding problems while on coumadin for PE in the past
- PE [**11-20**]
- multiple PNAs, most recently in [**12-24**] (as above)
- + PPD, treated with INH x8 months (completed in [**4-21**])
- COPD: FEV1 of 1.55 liters or 48% of predicted, an FVC of 2.38

liters or 53% of predicted, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 55%
- Pulmonary embolism [**11/2150**]
- L frozen shoulder


Social History:
Patient is divorced and lives with his two daughters. [**Name (NI) **] son as
well. Only rare alcohol use and prior tobacco use (roughly 70
pack years); he quit smoking approximately a year ago just prior
to be diagnosed with lung cancer. He was born in [**Country 5881**] and came
to the U.S. roughly forty years ago.

Family History:

died from.

rashes
HEENT: no JVD, no LAD, no oral ulcers or lesions

LUNG: bilateral high picked end expiratory wheeze
ABDOMEN: nondistended, +BS, nontender in all quadrants, no
rebound/guarding, no hepatosplenomegaly
M/S: moving all extremities well, no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema, no obvious deformities

ADMISSION CXR ([**2152-4-22**]):
1. Stable post left pneumonectomy changes.
2. Patchy nodular densities within the right lower lung, likely
reflect
residual infection, as seen on chest CT [**2152-4-7**].
3. Emphysema.

CTA CHEST ([**2152-4-24**]):
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Increased peribronchial and diffuse right lung opacities,
superimposed
upon emphysema. The diffuse abnormalities may be due to
pulmonary edema,
especially given a new small right pleural effusion, but diffuse
infection is also possible. Right middle lobe and other
peribronchial opacities slightly increased, likely infectious,
but attention to this region should be paid on subsequent
followups.
3. Persistent soft tissue lateral to the hilar pneumonectomy
stump, very
worrisome for local recurrence. Unchanged left basilar pleural
nodules,
suggestive of pleural metastases.
4. Signs of anemia.
5. Stable old left humeral bone infarct or enchondroma.

CXR ([**2152-4-26**]):
Patient is status post pneumonectomy on the left side. A
left-sided central
line is identified in situ. There is evidence of widespread
patchy change in the right lung, which is nonspecific, but as
mentioned before could reflect toxic drug damage ,edema or
infection. The appearances are certainly not changed from prior
day, but when compared to multiple prior radiographs have
demonstrated probable progressive change. The nodular pattern
may be misleading given the widespread emphysematous change
present. Osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo male with pmh of recurrent squamous cell lung carcinoma
s/p left pneumonectomy in [**2-20**] now s/p cycle one of gemcitabine
(last on [**2152-4-20**]) who presented on [**4-23**] with fevers and
hypotension possibly be secondary to Gemcitabine-related
inflammatory lung disease.

# Sepsis/Hypoxia:  Felt to be most likely related to
gemcitabine-related inflammatory lung disease.  He was initially
started on both high-dose steroids and broad spectrum
antibiotics (added to home Levaquin).  After culture data
returned negative, antibiotics were stopped and steroids were
continued.  He was maintained on [**4-19**] L of supplemental oxygen
throughout his hospitalization and was discharged home on this
amount.  His steroids were tapered after he began to improve: 60
mg prednisone [**Hospital1 **] x 2 days, then 60 mg daily x 2 days, then 40
mg daily x 2 days, then 20 mg daily x 2 days, then 10 mg daily x
2 days, then 5 mg daily x 2 days.  He will follow up with
pulmonary as an outpatient.

# Atrial fibrillation: During this hospitalization he was in
sinus rhythm.  He was continued on flecainide and aspirin; after
blood pressure improved, diltiazem was restarted.  He is not
systemically anticoagulated due to problems with bleeding in the
past.

# COPD: Continued on his home regimen of Advair, albuterol, and
spiriva.

# Anemia:  Likely from bone marrow suppression from
chemotherapy.  His Hct remained in the low 30's during his
hospitalization and his baseline is in the mid-30's.  He had no
clinical evidence of bleeding.

# Squamous cell carcinoma: Patient is s/p neoadjuvant cisplatin
and etoposide with concomitant radiation completed [**2151-1-13**] for
squamous cell lung cancer s/p left pneumonectomy on [**2151-3-4**]
and s/p first dose of palliative Taxotere on [**2-3**].  Most
recently s/p one cycle of gemcitabine as above.  He was
continued on the Levaquin which is given
