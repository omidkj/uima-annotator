Pacemaker update

History of Present Illness:
80M with a history of CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG in [**2098**], STEMI in
[**2111**] multiple interventions the most recent being [**2113-8-22**] with
PCI and BMS of native Lcx. He underwent implantation of dual
chamber [**Company 1543**] pacemaker in [**2113-2-16**] due to Wenchebach
Mobits type I heart block. Initially, he noted improvement in
exercise tolerance with the pacer noting that he was able to
walk [**2-17**] block without becoming fatigued or SOB. In the last two
months he has had progressive worsening of DOE and SOB such that
he is home bound and becomes dyspneic when walking from one room
to another. He currently has LV dysfunction, with an EF of
20-25%, which is down from when the pacemaker was placed. He has
class III heart failure symptoms with DOE with minimal exertion.
On the day of admission, he was electively admitted for upgrade
to a biventricular pacemaker. Unfortunately placement of the biV
leads was unsuccessful, the previous RV pacer wires remain and
his generator was up graded and changed to  DDI-55. He was
admitted to the CCU for post proceedural monitoring.
.
On arrive in the CCU his vitals were 97.0 67 100/70 95% 2L. EKG
Prolonged PR interval AV conduction delay with rate of 80bpm a
non conducted P and diffuse twave inversions.

CXR [**2115-1-18**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-12**], the right
ventricular
pacemaker lead has apparently been repositioned. Little change
in the
appearance of the cardiac silhouette. No definite pneumothorax
is
appreciated. The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion appears
to be
somewhat less than on the previous study.


Brief Hospital Course:
A 80 yoM with PMH NYHA Stage III heart failure and mobitz I
block admitted for upgrade of pacer.
.
# Pacemaker: Patient went for revision of pacer with plan for
BiV pacer placement which was unsuccessful due to anatomy. In
the proceedure, patient was noted to have sinus rhythm with
narrow complex. It was determined tat patient would benefit from
setting to only pace below ventricular rate of 55 rather than
continuous pacing between 60-120. The previous RV pacer wires
were left in place and his generator was upgraded and changed to
DDI-55. He was admitted to the CCU for post proceedural
monitoring. He was maintained on telemetry for 48 hours and
remained in sinus rhythm with occasional ventricular pacing.
.
# Congestive heart failure with systolic dysfunction:  NYHA
class IV heart failure. Between [**2112**] and [**2114**] patient's EF
decreased 50% 20-25%. On admission, patient noted worsening
dyspnea on exertion prior to admission. After the pacemaker
upgrade proceedure, patient developed new O2 requirement related
to decompensated congestive heart failure. Chest xray did not
show pulmonary edema or effusion. Immediately following the
proceedure, the patient was responsive to questions, answering
appropirately. Over the course of the following night, he became
progressively unresponsive. After a discussion with the family
detailing the low chance of a successful resuscitation effort,
the patient's code status was changed to DNR/DNI. He was treated
with a trial of BIPAP with improved responsiveness however
patient found the mask uncomfortable and it was discontinued
after 2 hours. The patient again became unresponsive.  The
patient remained unresponsive and another family meeting was
held in which the decsion was made to transition care to comfort
measures only. On hospital day 5 the patient expired with the
family at the bedside.
.
# Coronary artery disease: Patient with significant CAD s/p CABG
and multiple stents, most recenly BMS to Circumflex in [**2113**].
Cardiac ischamia likey contributed to development of heart
failure. Clopidogrel 75mg was continued throughout admission.
.
#ESRD: patient receives dialysis MWF and missed dialysis for EP
proceedure. Dialysis was attempted on HD 2, only 1L was removed
due to low blood pressure. No further dialysis was performed in
the course of this hospitalization.
