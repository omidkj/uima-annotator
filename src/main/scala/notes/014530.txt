Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
PEA arrest, complete heart block

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DDD pacer placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 58 year old woman with a history of chronic
dyspnea, breast cancer, AML with bone marrow transplant,
recurrent sinusitis, IgA deficit with monthly IVIG injections.
Per report the patient was exercising on a treadmill at home
when she collapsed and became unresponsive.  Her husband
performed CPR and the patient woke up briefly and then again
became unresponsive. MET intubated the patient at home and
continued CPR and found to be in PEA. On arrival she was found
to have complete heart block on ECG.  She was externally paced
and placed on a dopamaine drip and pulses returned, she was
hypothermic while in the ED as well.  Bedside echo showed normal
ventricular function.  CT angio was negative for PE.  CT head
was normal.  She had an SVT that then developed into complete
heart block and temp wire was placed.  Initial vitals were t 102
(after bearhugger) p 89 BP 104/74 rr 20 ox 96% FIO2 60%.

While there patient was started on neosynephrine, dopamine,
protonix and hep sc.  Also received clinda 600 mg iv q8 for
leukocytosis and propofol for sedation. Neuro consultation
diagnosed anoxic encephalopathy and recommended repeat CT and
eeg.  Patient remained febrile up to 105 prior to transfer.  She
wasn't tachycardic throughout most of the hospital course and
remianed with good urine output. Temporary pacing wire was
placed on [**10-15**] for persistent complete heart block, but per
report the patient was not pacer dependent.

On transfer, the patient was intubated and sedated.  Additional
history was obtained from the patient's husband.  [**Name (NI) **] describes
that she walked 15 minutes on the treadmill and was on the floor
stretching when she collapsed and became unresponsive.  The
husband started CPR and called 911.  Intermittently the patient
was awake and wanted to get dressed, but quickly collapsed and
he restarted CPR.

Per husband, prior review of systems was positive as known with
chronic shortness of breath x years with fatigue.  And ROS was
negative including any recent infective symptoms including
fever, chills, headache, syncope, joint or muscle pains, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea.  As far as he knows she was in her usual
state of health until Sat AM.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
presyncope.


Past Medical History:
1. History of AML with bone marrow transplant and total body
radiation in [**2098**].
2. History of left breast cancer, status-post modified
mastectomy
and left chest XRT in [**2083**].
3. Bilateral breast implants.
4. Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
5. Recurrent sinusitis with low IgA on monthly IVIG.
6. Hemochromatosis, status-post phlebotomies.
7. Noncaseating granulomas on liver biopsy.
8. Progressive exertional dyspnea.
9. Previous concern of restrictive or constrictive
cardiomyopathy (though last cath in [**2104**] did NOT confirm this)
10. New enlarged cervical right-sided lymph node.
11. Multiple drug allergies, including to multiple antibiotics.

Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.   She works at [**Company **]
[**Location (un) **].

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
but there is a family history of colon cancer.

to pain, has equivocal plantar reflexes.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**10-21**]:
Portable AP chest radiograph compared to previous study before
the procedure obtained on the same-day at 08:45 p.m.

The temporary pacemaker is removed in the meantime interval.
The left
hemithorax pacemaker was inserted with two leads terminating in
the right
atrium and right ventricle with expected course and no signs of
discontinuity. The Port-A-Cath catheter inserted through the
right subclavian vein terminates at the cavoatrial junction.

Bilateral perihilar opacities are consistent with pulmonary
edema and grossly unchanged as well as bibasilar retrocardiac
atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusion is present.

An external devise with a rectangular shape overlies the mid
chest.  The chest radiograph has to be repeated without this
artifact when the patient's condition allows.

EKG [**10-22**]: Sinus tachycardia. Marked left axis deviation. Left
anterior fascicular block. Right bundle-branch block. Q-T
interval prolongation. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since previous
tracing of [**2107-10-21**] atrial pacing is no longer present.

Rib Films: Three mildly displaced left-sided rib fractures.  No
evidence of pneumothorax.

[**10-16**] CT Head w/ and w/o contrast: 1.  No acute intracranial
hemorrhage.
2.  Worsening soft tissue changes of the maxillary sinuses
compared to
[**2102-11-10**].

[**10-16**] CT Neck w/ and w/o contrast:  No definite abscess or fluid
collection of the neck. Air- secretion level noted within the
maxillary sinuses in the setting of intubation. New patchy
opacities of the visualized lungs bilaterally and a new small
left pleural effusion, which may represent aspiration or
pneumonia.

CTA CHEST AT OSH NEGATIVE FOR PE, CT w/ contrast lower
extremities negative for DVT.
