Other Studes:
[**2170-7-19**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression. Non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Non-specific intraventricular conduction
delay. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2170-2-3**] QRS complex is
slightly wider, bradycardia is absent.
[**2170-7-19**] CXR: Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression. Non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Non-specific intraventricular conduction
delay. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2170-2-3**] QRS complex is
slightly wider, bradycardia is absent.
[**2170-7-26**] CXR: The nasogastric tube and the endotracheal tube have
been removed, the right-sided central venous access line is
unchanged. Moderate increase in extent of the pre-existing
retrocardiac opacity. The elevation of the right hemidiaphragm
and the subsequent right basal atelectasis are unchanged. No
newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No signs of overt overhydration. The left sinus is not included
on today's image. On the right, there is no evidence of pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Sepsis due to Severe multilobar CAP: The patient was
initially treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and azithromycin.
Sputum cultures done [**7-19**] showed orapharyngeal flora.
Bronchoalveolar lavage done while the patient was being treated
with antibiotics showed no growth. Given that he likely has a
community-acquired pneumonia, his antibiotics were switched to
just levofloxacin, on [**7-24**], which he should continue for a total
of 14 days ending on [**2170-8-1**].  He was given final po doses to
take at home upon discharge.
.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had to be intubated for poor
oxygenation. Besides the antibiotics, he was diuresed with
Lasix. He tolerated extubation well. His blood gasses have been
stable and show stable hypercarbia. He is on BiPAP 12L at night
(up from 8L at home) and nasal canula oxygen during the day. He
completed a prednisone taper on [**2170-7-27**].  He has also been
treated with [**Date Range 4010**], albuterol/ipratroprium nebs, and
montelukast.
.
3 Cardiac Demand Ischemia: The patient's troponins were elevated
but trended down during his hospital stay. By EKG and enzymes,
this likely resulted from demand ischemia. His Aspirin, plavis,
and lisinopril were continued. His beta-blocker was held
secondary to hypotenion.
.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures were 100/60 when
measured manually. His beta blocker and metolazone were held and
he was given a reduced dose of his home lasix. The patient was
diuresed with Lasix and was net negative for several days.
.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient had an elevated INR.  This was
thought to be secondary to poor nutrition and sepsis.  The
patient was given one dose of vitamin K on [**2170-7-27**].
.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has no history of DM, but has
elevated blood sugars in setting of infection/stress and
steroids. The patient's blood sugars were managed with sliding
scale insulin.
.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient was given atorvastatin.
.
8. Chronic diastolic CHF and CAD: The patient continued aspirin,
plavix, lisinopril, and lasix (at a lower dose). Metolozone and
metoprolol were held in the setting of hypotension.
.
