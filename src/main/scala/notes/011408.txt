Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and leg swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
removal of hardware from right hip


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 68459**] is a 49yo woman with h/o HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS who
was directly admitted from clinic on [**9-7**] with shortness of
breath and LE edema. Prior to presentation, her home lasix had
been stopped due to hyponatremia. She also notes that her
dyspnea has increased since her aldactone was stopped in
mid-[**Month (only) **] because of hyperkalemia. She was therefore
initially felt to be fluid overloaded and given lasix and then
albumin/lasix [**Hospital1 **] for diuresis.
.
The team obtained LE ultrasound and CTA chest, which were
negative for DVT or PE. Because of concern for possible
pneumonia on her CXR, she started treatment with vancomycin and
ceftriaxone on [**9-13**] (switched to vanc/ceftazidime [**9-14**]).
.
She has had a complicated hospital course, and has been followed
by ID, Orhopedics, and Psychiatry. The team obtained plain films
of her knee and hips because of a known h/o hip infection and
persistent leukocytosis. [**Month/Day (4) 1957**] was consulted and MRIs obtained,
concerning for right hip infection (where she has hardware from
an arthroplasty). She was found to have E coli from her right
hip aspirate, and zosyn was started on [**9-15**]. Because of
difficulties with hypoglycemia, she was started on stress dose
steroids given concern for adrenal insufficiency.
.
The night prior to transfer, Ms. [**Known lastname 68459**] was triggered for acute
hypoxia. She was found to be blue with pulse ox in the 50s in
RA. She improved with lasix and oxygen. Per report, she had an
episode of scant hemoptysis (not witnessed by MD). However, she
continued to have an increasing oxygen requirement through the
day and was transferred to the MICU for further care.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, she continued to feel somewhat out of
breath.

Social History:
The patient is single with one child, she was living in a
chronic care facility, [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 3894**] Nursing Facility in [**Location (un) 29158**] prior to admission. She is currently on disability,
formerly a waitress.

Physical Exam:
VS - 97.8 104 126/69 27 95% 6L
GENERAL - frail-appearing woman who appears anxious, she is
mildly tachypneic and has some distress when speaking.
HEENT - Pupils equal, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear,
+spider angiomata
NECK - supple, +JVD to angle of jaw when sitting at 45 degrees
LUNGS - crackles throughout lung fields b/l
HEART - Regular tachycardia with systolic murmur
ABDOMEN - +BS, soft/NT, no rebound/guarding
EXTREMITIES - warm with 2-3+ pitting BLE edema to above knees
R hip is tender to palpation and with movement at hip joint (leg
roll)
SKIN - spider angiomata
NEURO - awake, appropriate, A&Ox3, slight asterixis present


Pertinent Results:
[**2158-9-11**] MRI hip
1) Very limited study for reasons stated above.

2) Small residual or recurrent fluid collection within the soft
tissues
lateral and superior to the proximal aspect of the right hip
prosthesis
contiguous with the prosthesis, though intra-articular extent
cannot be
established on this study. Susceptibility artifact from the
prosthesis limits
evaluation for a hip joint effusion, though no large effusion is
directly
visualized.

3) Severe diffuse subcutaneous edema/anasarca as well as deep
interfascial and
muscular edema throughout the right thigh. No deep abscess/focal
fluid
collection.

[**9-8**]
bilateral hip xray
Since the prior study, interval continued periostitis and
erosion of the
lateral aspect of the proximal femur. This is worrisome for
continuing
infection

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 49-yo woman w/ HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, c/b ascites,
encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic hydrothorax,
currently on [**Month/Day (4) **] list w/ MELD 15, directly admitted from
clinic w/ worsening BLE edema and SOB in setting of being off
diuretics due to hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Transferred to
MICU [**2158-9-16**] for progressively worsening hypoxia and dyspnea
(See MICU course below)
.
#. SOB and BLE edema - Likely [**1-7**] fluid overload in setting of
being off diuretics. CXR does not reveal pulm edema or pleural
effusions as expected. Improved significantly w/ diuresis and
addition of albumin. She improved for several days w/ diuresis
but then her platelet count dropped and she developed
hemoptysis, after which her O2 sats dropped, CXR demonstrated
alveolar and interstitial opacities and she was transferred to
the ICU for further management of her hypoxia. She was intubated
in the ICU and diuresed for several days after her sugery, her
oxygenation slowly improved and she was extubated and
transferred to the floor. By the time she was transferred back
to the floor her edema was significantly improved.
.
#. Septic arthritis: Pt. had been on bactrim suppression for
CONS infxn of hardware, but got increasing hip pain and low
grade temps. Hip was tapped and grew E. coli resistant to
everything except pip/tazo and amikacin. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] held long
family meeting w/ pt. and discussed her poor prognosis w/ her
and code status. She decided to go ahead w/ all interventions
and to be full code. She recieved a right hip explant of all
hardware w/ placement of an abx spacer and continued on
vancomycin and meropenem per ID for a total 6-week course.
.
#. Hyponatremia - Hypoalbuminemia vs. adrenal insufficiency. She
was given albumin along w/ hydrocortisone for combination of
persistent hypoglycemia and hyponatremia.
.
#. Headache - Pt. complained of pain and locking of her jaw
while chewing. She was seen by dentistry who suggested that it
might be TMJ and that she should avoid chewy foods and possibly
get a night guard for her mouth.
.
#. Anemia - Appears anemia of liver disease, Hct trended slowly
downward and on day of transfer to MICU was 21.1. An NG tube was
placed in the ICU and she hemorrhaged from her nose and required
multiple transfusions before it stopped.
.
#. HCV cirrhosis - Pt w/ HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, c/b
encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, ascites, and hepatic
hydrothorax. Currently on [**Last Name (STitle) **] list, will need to complete
antibiotic treatment and have hip replaced before she can get a
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
#. Pain: Oxycontin with oxycodone for breathrough was continued.
 Lidoderm patches were also continued.
.
#. Asthma - was continued on her montelukast and advair along w/
albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
.
#. Diabetes: Glargine dose was cut from 40U on admission to 20 U
QD because the pt. presented w/ persistent hypoglycemia. She
will be discharged on 25 units at bedtime and a humalog sliding
scale.
.
#. Secondary adrenal insufficiency - continued home prednisone,
started stress dose hydrocortisone for persistent
hypoglycemia/hyponatremia which was tapered back to home dose
after 2 doses of stress dose.
.
#. GERD - home PPI was continued.
.
#. Depression / anxiety - continue home Effexor psych was
consulted per [**Last Name (STitle) **] coordinators request.
.
#. Osteopenia - continue home Vitamin D and Calcium carbonate
.
#. FEN - diabetic low-protein diet, albumin tonight then resume
diuresis, electrolyte repletion
.
