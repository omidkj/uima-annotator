CT Chest [**2198-7-11**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Type B aortic dissection originating just distal to left
subclavian artery
extending caudally to the level of the renal arteries. The
celiac trunk,
superior mesenteric artery and renal arteries originate from the
true lumen.
Dissection extends somehwat (about 1cm) into the the superior
mesenteric
artery without significant compromise of the blood flow through
its branches.
This extension is a new finding.

2. Multiple right pulmonary nodules. Prior studies are needed
for comparison
to ensure their stability. If none are available, PET scan may
be considered
for further evaluation as one nodule measure 1cm.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted for further work-up and management of his type B
aortic dissection.  He was started on labetalol drip for blood
pressure control.  Vascular surgery was consulted.  Chest CT was
performed to assess for progression of dissection.  This study
showed Type B aortic dissection originating just distal to left
subclavian artery extending caudally to the level of the renal
arteries. The celiac trunk,
superior mesenteric artery and renal arteries originate from the
true lumen.
Dissection extends somehwat (about 1cm) into the the superior
mesenteric
artery without significant compromise of the blood flow through
its branches.
Additionally, pulmonary nodules were noted and thoracic surgery
was consulted.  His oral medications were adjusted, he was
weaned off the labetolol drip and transferred to the floor.
Continued to monitor his blood pressure and adjusted
antihypertensives, with plan for discharge [**7-14**].  On [**7-14**] early am
he developed severe pain and was taken to CT scan for CTA of
aorta however he arrested prior to scan and the scan was
intubated and regained pulses and was transferred to the CVICU.
In the CVICU he went into Ventricular fibrillation and he was
defibrillated and CPR resumed with no return to life.  The
resuscitative efforts were stopped and he was expired at [**2198-7-14**]
at 0637.  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] spoke with daughter on the phone.
