Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath/cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with stent
Transbronchial lung biopsy

History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 yof with a history of Rheumatoid Arhritis,
Paroxysmal afib, HTN, CRF 1.5, C. diff colitis s/p ileostomy,
who was being worked up as an outpatient for likely metastatic
cancer who presented to the ED on [**12-2**] for T 100.5 and worsened
cough and shortness of breath x 3 days.  The patient reports
that over the she has had increasing respiratory symptoms over
the last month. In [**Month (only) **], she noticed increasing dyspnea with
mild activity, noticed expiratory wheezes, and had a few
episodes of coughing up whole blood clots. Over the last three
days, she has noticed a worsening of her dyspnea with an
associated productive cough with yellow mucous. Her two roomates

prednisone for the last week with arthritic pain. The patinet
spiked a temperature at home to 101, was having marked increase
in difficulty breathing, and decided to come to the ED.

Imaging:
[**12-2**]  EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 93, with first degree A-V
block. Possible inferior
myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Non-specific
repolarization
abnormalities. Borderline low voltage. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2142-11-23**] sinus rate is faster.
[**2142-12-2**] 04:02PM BLOOD Lactate-2.5*

[**12-2**] Chest CTA:
1. Pulmonary emboli in the left lower lobe segmental pulmonary
arteries
extending into the subsegmental arteries.
 2. Large ill-defined right hilar mass with encasement of the
distal right
main stem bronchus and bronchus intermedius with likely tumor
infiltration of
the bronchus intermediate versus obstructive debris.
 3. Likely post-obstructive infectious process of the right
lower lobe.
 4. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
 5. Tiny right-sided pleural effusion.

[**12-2**] CT head: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema,
masses, mass effect, or acute
infarction, within the limitations of recent contrast
administration, limiting
the evaluation of small masses or hemorrhage. The ventricles and
sulci
demonstrate mild prominence, most compatible with atrophic
change. There is
periventricular hypodensity, compatible with chronic small
vessel ischemic
changes. The visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air
cells are well aerated.

[**12-3**] LE U/S:
CONCLUSION:
1. There is non-occluding thrombus in the right greater
saphenous vein
superiorly, near the level of the saphenofemoral junction. It
does not extend
into the common femoral vein.
 2. There is DVT with occluding thrombus in a single peroneal
vein on the
right.
3. There is no evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the left
lower
extremity.

[**12-3**]  Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
interatrial septum is aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-7-25**], a
small atrial septal defect is not identified on the current
study (may be due to technical issues and better visualized by
TEE).

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yof with a history of Rheumatoid Arhritis, Paroxysmal afib,
HTN, CRF 1.5, C. diff colitis s/p ileostomy who presented to the
ED on [**12-2**] worsened cough and shortness of breath x 3 days.

# PE: In the ED, her Temp was 101.5, HR 95, RR 24 and 91% on RA.
She received nebs with "improved" oxygenation to 93% on 3L and
RR decreased to 18. CTA was done which showed left segmental PE
and right hilar mass with possible RLL post-obstructive
pneumonia.  She was started on heparin gtt which was eventually
changed to lovenox dosed daily secondary to her low GFR.  LENIs
were done which showed RLE DVT. Because of large clot burden and
tumor burden in lungs, a temporary IVC filter was placed.  The
patient continued to have oxygen requirement 3L by nasal canula,
likely from combination of PE, pneumonia, COPD, and tumor.
After assessment on PT, patient was prescribed home oxygen on
discharge to use at 2-3L/min.
.
# Pneumonia/COPD: Patient found to have obstructive PNA on CTA
chest on admission. Was started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin
but the ceftriaxone was discontinued as pt has known penicillin
allergy.  She was started on levofloxacin for a 14 day course.
The patient was also given solumedrol and started on high dose
prednisone (50 mg Q day) in the ICU for COPD exacerbation.  Her
steroids were weaned down during admission and she will be
discharged on a taper.  She responded well to continued
albuterol and atrovent nebulizers, and will be given nebulizer
treatments on discharge.
.
# Small cell carcinoma: The patient was undergoing outpatient
work up for a suspected lung carcinoma prior to presentation.
Chest CTA performed in the ED showed hilar mass.  She underwent
bronchoscopy with tumor debreidment and stenting to her bronchus
intermedius and had a biopsy which eventually showed small cell
carcinoma. PET scan was done as an outpatient and showed likely
lesion in acetabulum.  A baseline CEA was found to be elevated
at 52.  She was started on Etoposide and carboplatin on [**2142-12-7**].
She was also started on allopurinol (renally dosed).  Although
she was at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome, she was not
aggressively hydrated because of her already high O2 requirement
and fear of pulmonary edema.  The patient did not appear to
undergo tumor lysis syndrome and was not discharged on
allopurinol, although her hydrochloroth
