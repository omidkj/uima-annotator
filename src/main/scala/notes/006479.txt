Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 32612**]
Chief Complaint:
Epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2108-6-20**]: Diagnostic laparoscopy, open cholecystectomy with
shaved liver margin.

[**2108-6-28**]: Ultrasound-guided drainage catheter placements (two
catheters placed) to a perihepatic and subhepatic fluid
collection compatible with biloma.

[**2108-6-28**]:  Extravasation of the contrast was noted at the cystic
duct stump.  Otherwise normal post cholecystectomy
cholangiogram. A sphincterotomy was performed. A biliary stent
was placed successfully

[**2108-7-2**]:  EGD: a clot was seen at the sphincterotomy site,
which could not be dislodged.  No active bleeding was seen and
epinephrine was injected for hemostasis.


History of Present Illness:
64M admitted to [**Hospital6 4620**] 2 days ago for
epigastric pain ([**9-3**]) which was relieved with morphine. He
notes that he had a similar episode that last 2 hours 6 days
prior to his admission.  His pain lasted for 12 hours.  He notes
that he has felt fatigued over the past several months and has
had an intentiona weight loss of 15lbs.  He denies fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. His last bowel movement
was this AM and was of normal quality.

CT and US performed at [**Hospital6 4620**] demonstrated
heterogenous GB suggestive of malignancy. No evidence of
metastasis were seen on CT. Prior US here in [**2098**] showed normal
GB and was consistent with fatty liver.

PATHOLOGY: Pending

[**2108-6-22**] CHEST PORTABLE:
FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright radiograph is obtained.  The
lungs are low in volumes resulting in crowding of
bronchovascular structures. Left basal opacity is likely a
combination of atelectasis and small effusion.

[**2108-6-22**] ABD PORTABLE:
IMPRESSION: Likely small amount of free air in this patient who

[**2108-6-25**] PA/LAT:
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**6-22**], there is
slightly better
inspiration.  Little change in the appearance of the somewhat
enlarged cardiac silhouette without evidence of vascular
congestion.  Blunting of the lower right costophrenic angle with
lateral displacement of the dome of the hemidiaphragms suggests
some subpulmonic pleural effusion.  The degree of gas beneath
the hemidiaphragm on the left has substantially decreased. On
the lateral view, there is a small amount of gas in this region,
consistent with a small amount of postoperative residual
pneumoperitoneum.  Generalized ileus pattern is noted.

[**2108-6-28**] ERCP:
Extravasation of the contrast was noted at the cystic duct
stump.  Otherwise normal post cholecystectomy cholangiogram.
A sphincterotomy was performed.
A biliary stent was placed successfully

[**2108-7-2**] EGD:
A large adherent clot was noted at the sphincterotomy site. A
biliary stent was seen in placed. Despite multiple washes and
suction, clot could not be dislodged. No fresh blood was noted
at the site or in the stomach or duodenum. (injection)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with acute cholecystitis vs. GB malignancy was
admitted to the General Surgical Service for elective open
cholecystectomy. On [**2108-6-20**], the patient underwent open
cholecystectomy with shaved liver margin, which went well
without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). Patient's Foley was discontinued post op, he wasn't
able to void and was straight cath in the PACU. The patient
arrived on the floor on clears, on IV fluids and antibiotics,
and Dilaudid PCA for pain control. The patient was
hemodynamically stable.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient has a history of CAD, s/p CABG [**2106**]. Immediately
post op he was started on telemetry for continuous O2 Sats
monitoring. On POD # 2, patient was noticed to have irregular
rate and rhythm, patient was asymptomatic. EKG was obtained and
revealed A-fib. Cardiology was consulted and their
recommendations were followed. The patient spontaneously
returned back to RRR within in hour after onset of A-fib.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative. He received 20 mg
IV Lasix for small left pulmonary effusion with good response.
Patient again went into a-fib while undergoing ERCP. Cardiology
was consulted again and they recommended no echo as an
inpatient. They recommended a regimen of Toprol XL 75mg [**Hospital1 **],
continue with full dose aspirin, and follow up with his
outpatient cardiologist to discuss the possibility of long-term
anticoagulation. On POD#10, the patient experienced [**9-3**]
shoulder and jaw pain.  ECG and cardiac enzymes were negative
for cardiac ischemia and the pain was not relieved by morphine
or nitroglycerin. The pain resolved over the course of the early
morning. The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; he remained on telemetry for cardiac monitoring.

Pulmonary: The patient was required supplemental O2 post op, and
his O2 sats were monitored with continuous pulse sats. On POD#
1, patient started to wean off supplemental O2. He wasn't able
to take a deep breath secondary to post op pain. Chest x-ray was
obtained and demonstrated left atelectasis and small effusion.
Patient received 20 mg Lasix and his respiratory quality
improved. He periodically required supplemental O2 prior to
discharge; 1 L in rest and 3L via n/c during ambulation.
Pulmonology was consulted and their recommendations were
followed. The patient was able to be weaned off of oxygen, with
sats above 93% on room air on ambulation and at rest.

GI: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well tolerated.
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid
was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely
followed, and repleted when necessary. An elevated WBC on POD#7
prompted a CT scan of the torso, which revealed a subcapsular
fluid collection, at which point he was taken to interventional
radiology and the fluid collection was drained. Two drains were
placed in the fluid collecti
