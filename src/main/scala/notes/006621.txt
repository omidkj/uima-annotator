Chief Complaint:
Syncope, fall, SAH
Hyponatremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
80F with hyponatremia transferred from OSH for unwitnessed fall
from standing with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Pt got up to go to
the bathroom, woke up on the floor. On asa. Recent uti on cipro.
Daughter brought her to the hospital because she felt that the
patient was more lethargic. Pt denies any lighheadedness, chest
pain, palpitations prior to the fall. Pt also notes left collar
bone pain.
.
In the ED, initial vitals 99 130/80 16 98%RA. Neuor exam
reported as completely unremarkable. Seen by neurosurgery, who
recommended repeat imaging and work-up of syncope. Got 1L NS,
nebs and ativan. Head CT showed b/l frontal and left temporal
subarachnoid hemmorhage, intraventricular hemmorhage (b/l),
hemmorhage within the interventricular septum and small left
epidural hematoma. Labs notable for a Na of 123 which was
reported as chronic. EKG sinus with PACs, poor R wave
progression, diffuse T wave flattening. C-Spine CT reported as
negative at OSH. Cardiac enzymes negative x3.

Cough, gagging and dry heaves every morning for the last several
months, 40lb unintentional weight loss over the last few years

Radiology Report CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of
[**2151-8-13**] 3:35 PM

IMPRESSION:
1. No interval change to bilateral subarachnoid,
intraventricular, and left parietal extra-axial hemorrhages. No
significant midline shift.
2. Normal-appearing CTA without evidence of AV malformation or
aneurysm.

----------

Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2151-8-12**]
10:26 PM

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral frontal and left temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Hemorrhage within the ventricles as well as within the
interventricular
septum.
3. Small left posterior parietal epidural hematoma. No
significant shift of normally midline structures.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The lentiform extra-axial
hematoma
demonstrates internal low-attenuation, which may represent acute
non-
clotted blood ("swirl sign") and, given the overall appearance
of the brain with multi-compartmental hemorrhage, may warrant
close imaging follow-up.

----------

CT C-Spine: Negative for fracture per OSH record.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo female transferred from OSH s/p unwitnessed fall with
subarachnoid and epidural hemorrhages admitted to medicine for
syncope work-up and transferred to ICU for management of
hyponatremia.
.
# Hyponatremia: Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] hyponatremia in 130s; Na in
120s on admission. Most likely etiology is worsening SIADH in
setting of psychiatric medications, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Also given smoking history and unintentional weight loss
neoplasm is of concern.  Urine osms are inappropriately elevated
consistent with SIADH.  Mental status is at [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**].  Sodium
checks at discharge was consistently at [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] in 130s.
Patient alert and oriented x 3.  Fluid restriction should be
continued.  Patient's diazide was discontinued and should likely
not be restarted.
.
# Subarachnoid hemorrhage/epidural hematoma: No evidence of mass
effect or shift. Coags nl. Neuro exam intact with deterioration
>24 hours s/p fall unlikely per Neurosurg.  Repeat CT head
without progression. Patient will f/u with neurosurgery on an
outpatient basis.
.
# Altered mental status: Reportedly with subtle changes from
[**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] although mentating at [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] currently per family;
neuro exam nonfocal other than reported instability in setting
of subarrachnoid hemorrhage. [**Month (only) 116**] be also from component from
hyponatremia. Being treated for UTI with no fevers or
leukocytosis to suggest active infection. Resolved by discharge.
.
# Syncope: Hemorrhage presumably due to rather than cause of
syncope/fall. Pt was orthostatic on floor. Ddx includes
vasovagal, seizure. Cardiac enzymes negative. No arrhythmia on
EKG other than PACs. Bedside TTE in [**Hospital1 2436**] and our ED
reportedly unremarakable.  Formal TTE here without etiology of
syncope.
.
# Hypertension: BP elevated after stopping dyazide, started
metoprolol and this should be uptitrated as an outpatient.  She
has a pcp appt scheduled next week.
.
# Anxiety: Continue home ativan with additional doses prn
.
# UTI: On methanamine for suppressive therapy but started on
cipro for UTI. Will continue cipro on discharge.
.
# Stridor: Chronic per report and related with anxiety and COPD.
 ENT was c/s for evaluation and they felt that there was no
surgical issue or paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction or
paralysis.  CT neck was also negative for pathology.
