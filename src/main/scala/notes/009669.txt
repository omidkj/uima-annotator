Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, chest pain and pre-syncope


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2177-3-25**] - Aortic Valve Replacement (21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue)
[**2177-3-31**] - Exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy


History of Present Illness:
83 year old female transferred from OSH for cardiac
catheterization. She had been experiencing a constellation of
symptoms including chest pressure, palpitations,
lightheadedness, dyspnea on exertion, and presyncope for several
days prior to admission. On [**3-11**] she presented to her
cardiologist's office where TTE showed (NEW?) aortic stenosis.
EKG revealed Afib with ST segment and T wave abnormalities in
the inferior and lateral leads. She was admitted to an OSH for
further evaluation. Given the severity of aortic stenosis seen
on echo, she was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for right and left cardiac
catheterization and for a surgical evaluation for an aortic
valve
replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2177-3-25**] - ECHO
PREBYPASS: Preserved LV systolic function with LVEF > 55%. The
left atrium is mildly dilated. There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and have minimal
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mild TR, Mild PI. There is no pericardial effusion. No PFO, No
clot in LAA seen.

POSTBYPASS: Normally functioning AV prosthesis in place. No AI
No AS. Otherwise unchanged.

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Followup to look for free intraperitoneal air.

TECHNIQUE: Upright and lateral chest views were read in
comparison with the
prior radiograph from [**2177-3-30**].

FINDINGS: Large free intraperitoneal air has substantially
increased over the
last 24 hours. Right-sided PICC line tip ends at lower
SVC/cavoatrial
junction. Mildly enlarged heart size is stable. Mediastinal and
hilar
contours are unremarkable. Both lungs are clear, no opacities
concerning for
pneumonia or aspiration. There is evidence of prior median
sternotomy and
sternal sutures are intact.

IMPRESSION: Large free intraperitoneal air substantially
increased over the
last 24 hours.

Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] discussed the findings with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1439**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], by phone on
[**2177-3-31**] at 9:14 a.m.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Final Report
INDICATION: Recent colectomy. Evaluation for ileus or
obstruction.

COMPARISON: [**2177-4-1**].

FINDINGS: Supine and upright abdominal radiographs demonstrate
dilated loops
of small bowel and air-fluid levels measuring up to 5 cm in
diameter. There
is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air. Midline surgical
staples are
noted. Mild left pleural effusion is unchanged. Osseous
structures are
unremarkable.

FINDINGS: Marked small-bowel dilatation, most likely
representing
post-operative ileus. However, if there is concern for
obstruction, CT would
be beneficial.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 110877**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2177-3-24**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve disease. She was placed on
heparin as she had been off her coumadin for five days. She was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On [**2177-3-25**], she was
taken to the operating room where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement using a tissue valve. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care
unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, she was
neurologically intact and extubated. Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  She developed rapid atrial fibrillation.
Amiodarone was started and Lopressor titrated.  Also,
anti-coagulation was intiated with Warfarin.  The patient
converted to sinus rhythm then developed bradycardia with 1st
degree AV block.  Amiodarone and lopressor were discontinued.
Rapid AFib returned and Lopressor was titrated accordingly.
The patient was noted to have free air under the diaphragm on
routine CXR.  Initially, abdominal exam was benign, she was soft
and non-tender.  Tenderness developed and the abdomen became
distended. Follow-up Abdominal film revealed significant
increase in free air.  General surgery took the patient
emergently to the OR for exploratory lapar
