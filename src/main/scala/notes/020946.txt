Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 y.o. male with HTN, dyslipidemia, fam history of
CAD, who had an MI and subequent 5 vessel CABG in [**2094**](at age
44).  Reccurent chest pain in [**12-8**]- recathed which revealed
native 3VD, and occulsion of [**2-5**] bypass grafts with SVG-RCA,
distal occlusion of sequential SVG to Ramus to OM1 to OM2, with
90% stenosis of touchdown on the OM1 and occlusion of SVG
proximal to OM2.  Patent LIMA- distal LAD, collaterals present
to distal RCA. He was treated medically and did well until 3
days ago and presented to MWH [**6-7**] with mulitple episodes of
angina and several episodes of nocturnal rest angina. New ST
depression in V2-V4 and CPK 300/ MB 28/Trop 1.3. He underwent
diagnostic cath [**6-7**] which revealed an EF of 45% with old
inferobasal and new anterolateral and mid inferior hypokinesis.
LVEDP 20 mmHg. Cors showed native 3VD with occlusion of the
SVG-RCA and SVG-Ramus-OM1-OM2. Patent LIMA-LAD but there is a
new high grade occlusion distal to the touchdown site.  At OSH
patient was started on integrillin and IV heparin. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) 93308**] films and determined not to be good surgical canidate.
The night prior to transfer he developed a nose bleed and
integrillin was stopped but heparin gtt was continued. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for high risk/Impella supported LAD
intervention. During his cath he had 2 DES placed to the
circumflex and POBA to LAD. His LIMA to LAD is patient but he
has a 90% distal occlusion of the LAD. Of note he received 925cc
of contrast during his catherization.

COMMENTS:
1- R CFA access via 6 F sheath. Abdominal aortography (40 cc
contrast at
20 cc/sec) performed in the AP view and patent abdominal aorta,
L iliac
system and L CFA seen. The 6F sheath was upsized to 8F sheath.
2- L CFA access with 6F sheath. Partially deployed two perclose
(preclosed the arteriotomy site). We then serially upsized to 8
F and
then to the Impella 13 F sheath.
3- Utilizing standard procedure guidelines, we inserted Impella
(2.5)
percutaneous LV assist device via the L CFA  after placement of
a 13 F
sheath. The device was set at P8, providing 2.2 L/min of
support.
4- Selective LMCA angiography confirmed the presence of severe
native
vessel disease.
  - The LMCA had mild proximal-mid disease followed by a
calcific plaque
    (60-70% stenosis) distally, extending into the
ostial/proximal LAD
    and LCX. The LAD and LCX origins had 80-90% focal stenosis.
  - The proximal LAD was diffusely and severely disease with
heavy
    calcification and wishbone tortuousity. It gave rise to a
sizable
    septal branch (just about the size of the LCX), which
supplied
    collateral flow to the distal OM and RCA branches. The LAD
had a 90%
    focal stenosis at the origin of larger septal and diagonal
branches
    then occluded at mid vessel just after the takeoff of a
large size
    (2.0-2.5 mm lumen) and long bifurcating (gives a small lower
pole
    branch that heads to the lateral wall followed by a large
lower pole
    branch that acts as a septal) diagonal branch and supplies
    collaterals to the distal OM branches. The origin/proximal
segment
    of this diagonal branch was tortuous and calcific with 80%
stenosis.
    The LAD proper was chronically occluded at mid vessel (at
point of
    origin of the large septal and diagonal branches described
above).
    There is a small are with ectasia/aneurym at the terminal
point of
    the LAD. Other smaller septals were seen. The LCX
  - The LCX ostium and oriximal segment had 80-90% calcific
stenosis
    followed by a long segment of diffuse disease (70%) tapering
at
    mid-distal vessel with a focal 90% stenosis. A late filling
    chronically occludeed OM branch was also seen.The LCX was
the
    primary source of collaterals to the distal RAC branches. No
otehr
    OMs were seen (used to have 3 large OM branches per prior
cath
    reports).
  - The RCA (known diseased/occluded), vein grafts (known
occluded), and
    LIMA (known patent with severely diffuse post anastomosis
LAD
    disease and a discrete 90% anastomosis site lesion affecting
both
    the LAD proper and a diagonal branch)
5- Successful high-risk PTCA and stenting of the LMCA with a
3.0x18 mm
Promus DES extending into and overlapping with a proximal-mid
LCX 2.5x28
mm Promus DES. The LMCA stent was postdilated to 4.0 and the LCX
stent
with a 2.5 mm balloon at 20-22 ATM. The overlap zone was
postdilated
with the 3.0 Promus SDS balloon at 20 ATM. Final angiography
showed
excellent results with 0% residual stenosis within the stents,
TIMI 3
flow and no apparebt dissection or distal emboli. The jailed lAD
ostium
had 50-60% stenosis but normal flow to the proximal segment (see
# 6).
6- Successful PTCA of the proximal LAD with 2.5 mm balloon at 8
ATM.
Final angiography showed diffuse residual disease (30-40%) with
TIMI 3
flow within the angoplastied segment and TIMI 2/staccato flow in
teh
distal LAD branches.
7- Successful weaning of the Impella device and removal of the
13 F L
CFA sheath with complete deployment of the two Perclose Proglide
closure
devices with adequate hemostasis
8- [**Month/Day/Year 18583**] removal of the RCFA 8F sheath and closure with an
8F
Angioseal with excellent hemostasis
9- Monitor
