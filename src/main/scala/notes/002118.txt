Date of Birth:   [**2081-8-7**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Urology

CONDITION UPON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

The patient is discharged to home.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 18685**] is a 67-year-old
male noted to have a right kidney mass consistent with a
renal cell carcinoma after presenting with microscopic
hematuria.  By imaging, he was noted to have bilateral renal
cysts as well as a 2nd lesion in the right kidney that was
consistent with a Bosniak III cyst.

The patient was subsequently prepared for a right partial
nephrectomy with the knowledge of a possible right total
nephrectomy.  Of note, the patient's more recent past medical
history included a recent gastrointestinal bleed from a
hiatal hernia ulcer for which he was found to be H. pylori
positive and a pulmonary embolus in the setting of the
gastrointestinal bleed where he had an IVC filter placed.

His past medical history otherwise includes:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post left anterior
descending artery stent in [**2144**], cardiac catheterization in
[**2149-3-21**], status post stent and PTCA again of the left
anterior descending artery as well as PTCA of the obtuse
marginal.  Ejection fraction was 58% with anterolateral and
apical hypokinesis.
2. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease with a FEV1 of
54% of predicted, FVC of 80% of predicted, and FEV1/FVC ratio
of 67% of predicted.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed as noted above.
4. Pulmonary embolus as noted above.
5. Hernia repair in [**2138**].

His medications at home include Nifedipine XL 30 mg po q day,
metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], tamsulosin 0.4 mg po q day, aspirin
which was stopped [**2149-5-21**], sublingual nitroglycerin for
which he rarely uses, and an incomplete treatment for his H.
pylori.

His allergies include a question of an allergy to one of the
medications in his Prevpak.

His examination on admission shows an elderly Russian
speaking male in no acute distress.  His blood pressure is
145/94.  His heart rate is 78.  His head and neck examination
are benign.  His lungs show some diffuse scattered mild
expiratory wheezes.  His heart is regular, rate, and rhythm.
His abdomen is soft and nontender with a well-healed vertical
incisional scar consistent with is previously known hiatal
hernia repair.  He has no costovertebral angle tenderness.
He has slight bilateral lower extremity edema with easily
palpable pulses.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted status post a
right partial nephrectomy performed on [**2149-5-30**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9125**].  His postoperative pain management included an
epidural which appeared to be working.  At the initial night
in the Intensive Care Unit, due to a postoperative
temperature of 102 and a decreased respiratory rate felt
consistent with his residual anesthesia and epidural.

Overnight he did well with good pain control.  He completed
his perioperative course of antibiotics.  His temperature
curve returned to [**Location 213**].  He was slowly started on sips on
postoperative day two.  He was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day three, the patient was originally doing
well.  However, in the afternoon, he developed acute
respiratory distress.  He was transferred back down to the
Intensive Care Unit, where he was intubated with a question
of an aspiration pneumonia versus lobar collapse versus
pulmonary embolus.  That night he subsequently underwent a
chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT scan which showed no evidence
of pulmonary embolus and no evidence of postoperative bleed.
He was status post bronchoscopy which was unrevealing showing
no inflammation of the bronchial mucosa.  He also underwent a
thoracentesis under ultrasound guidance for which 500 cc of a
bloody effusion on the right was obtained.

The effusion, bronchoalveolar lavage, and sputum cultures
were all negative.  The cytologies were all negative.
Patient subsequently underwent recruitment maneuvers on the
ventilator and was subsequently extubated on postoperative
day six.  He did well status post extubation, and was
transferred to the surgical floor on postoperative day seven.

He continued on a presumptive course for aspiration pneumonia
including levofloxacin and Flagyl.  With the passage of
flatus, his diet was advanced as tolerated.  He continued to
do well, weaning off the oxygen.

On discharge, by postoperative day nine, he was continuing on
his levofloxacin and Flagyl on day [**7-30**].  He was ambulating
without difficulty.  He was on room air without any
recurrence of respiratory distress or wheeze on auscultation.
He is tolerating a regular diet.  He was moving his bowels.
He is voiding without difficulty.  His incision was clean,
dry, and intact.  His [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain had been removed
postoperatively previously on postoperative day three.

He was subsequently discharged to home after verifying that
there is no evidence of any deep venous thrombosis for his
lower extremity edema with a lower extremity noninvasive test
on the date of discharge.

His medications on discharge include his preoperative
medications of Nifedipine XL 30 mg po q day, Lopressor 25 mg
po bid, levofloxacin 500 mg po q day, Flagyl 500 mg po tid,
Percocet 1-2 tablets po q 4 hours prn pain, Colace 100 mg po
bid, and albuterol inhaler two puffs qid prn wheeze.

He will follow up with his primary care physician to further
workup his preoperative and postoperative pulmonary issues.
Prior to discharge, his staples were removed.  His pathology
results were given to him and his family.  He will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**] in approximately two weeks as well to
reassess his wound healing and to finalize his postoperative
oncologic plan.
