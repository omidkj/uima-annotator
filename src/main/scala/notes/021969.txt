ADDENDUM:

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the anticipated date of discharge the
patient had persisting somnolence.  Arterial blood gas
performed to document hypercarbia:  The pH was 7.21, pCO2 87,
pO2 80 on one liter by nasal cannula confirming an acute on
chronic respiratory acidosis.  The patient's narcotics were
discontinued; specifically, the transdermal fentanyl patch
was removed and the oxycodone/acetaminophen tablet frequency
was decreased.  Six hours following the documentation
described above, a repeat arterial blood gas was performed
showing slight improvement; specifically, the pH was 7.32,
pCO2 68, pO2 54.  On all gases the SaO2 was above 95 percent.

In the face of the patient's transient hypercarbia and acute
on chronic respiratory acidosis, he was transfer to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for initiation of biphasic
positive airway pressure ventilation without oxygen
supplementation.  On the first night in the Medical Intensive
Care Unit the patient required four hours of BiPAP although
by the morning he was breathing comfortably on his own.  A
repeat blood gas showed stable chronic respiratory acidosis
with pH of 7.39, pCO2 58 and pO2 was 79 on the day of
discharge from the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Of note, he
spent two days in the Intensive Care Unit, the second night
he did not require biphasic positive airway pressure.  After
returning to the Medical [**Hospital1 **], assessment of his vancomycin
trough was found to be elevated at nearly 30 mcg/mL.  This
medication was held for a day and a half until the random
level decreased below 15.  It was restarted at one gram every
36 hours intravenously.  The duration of the treatment is
unchanged from the previous discharge summary; specifically,
this medication should continue for 14 days starting from [**2140-4-26**], along with ceftazidime one gram every eight hours.

Regarding the patient's depression, given that he had a
protracted stay, inpatient psychiatric evaluation was
obtained and stimulating anti-depressant, specifically
bupropion, was added to his regimen.  The patient shall
establish psychiatric care at [**Hospital6 733**] upon
discharge from the rehabilitation hospital.
