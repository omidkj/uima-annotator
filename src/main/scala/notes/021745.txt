MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol 100 P.O. once daily,
quinidine 324 mg P.O. 3 times a day,
triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide 37.5 mg P.O. once daily,
Relafen 750 mg P.O. once daily, Nexium 40 mg P.O. once daily,
Allopurinol 300 mg P.O. once daily, Flovent and albuterol
inhalers, fluocinonide 0.05 percent and Dovonex 0.005 percent
medications for psoriasis.

Cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 205**] of 204 showed 70 percent
lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 50
percent lesion of the ramus, 70 percent lesion of the
circumflex, 50 percent lesion of the obtuse marginal, 80
percent lesion of the right coronary artery.  Aortic valve
area is 0.8 cm sq with a mean gradient of 49 and a 5.5 cm
ascending aorta.  Echocardiogram in [**2162-5-27**] showed
ejection fraction of 60 percent, aortic valve area of 0.7 cm
sq, a peak gradient of 72 mm and a mean gradient of 50 as
well as mild mitral regurgitation.  Abdominal CT scan
obtained at the outside hospital showed a normal liver and
spleen without any focal abnormalities.  Gallbladder was
absent with no ductal dilatation.  Abdominal aorta had mild
calcifications.  Please refer to the follow up report.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.8, heart rate 58, blood
pressure 142/88, respiratory rate 18, saturation 98 percent
on room air.  He is sitting in bed in apparent distress.  His
pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  He was anicteric, noninjected.  His
neck was supple.  He had no obvious skin lesions, no
lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  No bruits or jugular venous
distension.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His heart was
regular rate and rhythm with S1 S2 tones and a grade III/VI
blowing systolic murmur.  His abdomen was obese, soft,
nontender with positive bowel sounds.  His extremities were
warm with no edema.  He had 2 plus bilateral carotid pulses,
1 plus bilateral radial pulses, 1 plus bilateral femoral
pulses and no palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial
pulses.

He was admitted preoperatively for Bentall procedure and
coronary artery bypass grafting and the idea was to have a
hepatology consult first prior to surgery given his history
of cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia.  He was seen by the
hepatology fellow on the day of admission.  With attempts to
try to correct on his prior notes from his hospitalization
where the diagnosis was made, preliminary carotid ultrasound
also showed no significant hemodynamic lesions in either the
right or left carotid bifurcation.  On in-house day two his
laboratories were as follows:  Sodium 144, potassium 4.1,
chloride 105, bicarb 28, BUN 20, creatinine 1.4 with a blood
sugar of 146.  ALT 18, AST 12, alkaline phosphatase 112,
total bilirubin 0.5, albumin 4.1, amylase 113, lipase 124,
HDL 47, cholesterol 191, white count 7.6, hematocrit 39.2,
platelet count 165,000.  PT 12.8 with an INR of 1.0.  He was
alert and oriented.  His exam was unremarkable with a chest x-
ray that showed multiple calcified granulomas throughout his
lungs, no pneumonia or congestive heart failure but he had a
5 mm nodule in the right lower lobe.  Repeat echocardiogram
showed ejection fraction to be 60 percent with a 5.4 cm
ascending aorta normal root diameter, severe aortic stenosis,
mild mitral regurgitation.  Hepatology attending stated he
would not perform a liver biopsy at this time prior to his
surgery.

On [**9-15**] he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
times four with a left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending coronary artery, a vein graft to the
obtuse marginal, vein graft to the posterior descending
coronary artery and a vein graft to the ramus.  2) Aortic
valve replacement, 25 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial
valve.  3) Ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement with 30
mm Gel-weave graft.  He was transferred to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on a dobutamine drip
at 2.5 mcg per kilo per minute, propofol drip titrated and a
nitroglycerine drip at 1.2 mcg per kilogram per minute.  On
postoperative day one his postoperative laboratories were as
follows:  Potassium 5.0, white count 12.4, hematocrit 29.3,
platelet count 103,000.  BUN 17, creatinine 1.4.  His INR was
1.4.  He was on dobutamine drip at 2.5, insulin drip at 1 and
propofol drip at 10.  The plan was to wean his ventilator, he
started on Lasix diuresis and to try to wean his dobutamine.
His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His heart was regular rate
and rhythm.  His incisions were clean, dry and intact.  He
remained on the ventilator that morning.  He was moving all
four extremities at the time.  He was evaluated initially by
Case Management and followed daily by the hepatology service.

That evening the patient developed atrial fibrillation which
was initially tolerated and rate controlled with Lopressor.
Eventually his heart rate increased.  Again he was started on
diltiazem drip.  He was also given intravenous Lasix with
minimal response as well as albuterol nebulizer.  The
decision was made to attempt cardioversion.  He was attempted
at 200, 300 and 350 joules without any evidence of sinus
rhythm.  He was then intubated for worsening hypoxia.  He had
stable blood pressure throughout.  On postoperative day two
he was extubated.  His dobutamine was decreased.  He was
given a unit of packed red blood cells and he was now on a
Nipride drip at 0.25 mcg per kilogram per minute.  His
creatinine was stable with 1.3 with a potassium of 4.1.  His
INR dropped slightly to 1.2 with a white count of 12.2 and a
hematocrit of 32.0.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm.
He had decreased breath sounds at both bases.  His chest
tubes remained in place.  He had 1 plus peripheral edema.  He
was started on low dose beta blocker with hydralazine PRN
with plan to try to wean his Nipride.  He also continued on
Lasix diuresis and the plan was to try and get him out of bed
and get started with physical therapy.  He was also seen by
the electrophysiology service fellow that afternoon.
However, he remained on diltiazem drip and electrophysiology
service recommendations were followed.  Again the patient had
some labile wound dynamics with another episode of atrial
fibrillation.  An attempt was made to put a Swan-Ganz
catheter back in.  On postoperative day three the patient
remained intubated on Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.7.  He had a
blood pressure of 110/56 with a heart rate of 105 and atrial
fibrillation.  He remained intubated at that time.  His
creatinine was stable at 1.3 and he rema
