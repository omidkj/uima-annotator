Intubation
Bronchoscopy
Central Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79 yo F with h/o NSCLC/BAC s/p lobectomy at [**Hospital1 112**] on
Tarceva, COPD/bronchiectasis on intermittent home o2, Pulmonary
MAC in '[**99**] s/p 18 months Rx now with recurrence MAC, IgG
deficiency on IVIG (last on [**2105-4-8**]), who was diagnosed by her
[**Company 2860**] provider at the end of [**Month (only) 958**] with PNA at which time she was
prescribed levaquin ([**4-20**]).
.
Started levofloxacin on [**4-20**] but despite antibiotics had
increased SOB with worsening of her chronic cough. In this
setting she was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] for PNA and COPD
exacerbation.
.
Pt had CT with bilateral infiltrates and possible mucous
plugging and negative for PE. There she was started on cefepime,
azithro, nebs, and solumedrol.
.
Her OSH course was c/b demand ischemia (0.15, that trended down

to 0.1). The pt refused bronch. ID was also consulted, and
thought atypical PNA was possible vs. noninfectious cause, but
recommended continuing abx. Of note treatment for her recurrant
MAC has not been
started as she is currently on Tarceva.
.
She had been doing well on the floor until, shortly after being
examined by the pulmonary consult team on [**4-29**] she acutely
decompensated from a respiratory standpoint. She dropped her
oxygen sats as low as 42%. A respiratory code was called and the
patient was peri-intubation. She was placed on a nebulizer and
given 40mg of IV lasix and her sats came up to the mid-low 90's.
She was transferred to the MICU
.
Upon arrival to the MICU she was initially hypoxic and
tachypneic and was consented for intubation, however after 1
hour on continuous nebulizers her oxygenation came up to 99% on
NRB. VBG at that time revealed 7.46 40. The decision was made to
intubate that patient by [**4-30**]. BAL performed on [**4-30**], which was
repeated on [**5-1**], showed no mucous plugging. Patient finished a 5
day course of azithromycin on [**5-2**], and on [**5-3**] a steroid taper
was started at 30mg QD with a plan for a 10 day total taper.
Patient extubated on [**5-3**] successfully, monitored until [**5-4**] and
sent to the floor.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient was comfortable, appropriate
and was only c/o some mild SOB with occasional cough.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

Initial CXR:
Chain suture in the right lower lung denotes the region of prior
surgery, but
the details of lobectomy are not obvious from this radiographic
appearance.
There is some pleural thickening at the right base as well as
atelectatic lung
draped over the right heart extending to the diaphragm. Upper
lungs are
clear. Left lung shows diminished vascularity suggesting
emphysema. On the
lateral view, a large elliptical opacity projecting over the
cardiac
silhouette may contain the right middle lobe bronchus but I
can't tell whether
this is atelectasis or thickening in the neo-fissure after
surgery. It could
even be a mass. Evaluation would require comparison to prior
chest imaging
not available to me now and may warrant chest CT scanning.

Left lung is generally clear aside from mild linear scarring or
atelectasis
extending to minimally thickened lateral costal pleural surface.
There is no
layering pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy. The
heart is
mildly to moderately enlarged. Atherosclerotic calcification is
heaviest at
the origin of head and neck vessels, less so but extending
throughout the
aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. Lateral view also
suggests
calcification in the proximal coronary arteries. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
paged.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Pt is a 79yoF with h/o lung CA s/p lobectomy at [**Hospital1 112**], on Tarceva,
COPD/bronchiectasis on home O2 (does not always use), MAC '[**99**]
s/p 18 months Rx, now with recurrent MAC, IgG deficiency on IVIG
(last on [**2105-4-8**]), HTN/CAD, saw her [**Company 2860**] provider at the end of
[**Month (only) 958**] and dx'd with PNA, who presented with dyspnea - was
treated for pneumonia initially. She was transferred to the ICU
early in her course and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory
distress.  After extubation, on the floor, she developed a
second infection and was discharged to complete an additional
course of IV antibiotics in addition to a steroid taper.
.
# Dyspnea/hypoxic respiratory failure: On transfer from OSH, the
patient was continued on Vanc/Cefepime/Azithromycin for presumed
pneumonia. She developed acute respirtory distress on HD1 with
transient saturations to the 40s, which spontaneously corrected
with nebulizer treatments. She was transferred then to the MICU
for
