Expected post-operative progressive changes following left
pneumonectomy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38758**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent a left pneumonectomy.  He
tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable
condition.  He maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was
well controlled with an epidural catheter.  His IV fluids were
minimized in light of his pneumonectomy.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he was able to maintain
good oxygen saturations and did effective incentive spirometry.
He developed some rapid atrial flutter on post op day #1 and was
treated with Lopressor and eventually diltiazem.  His
electrolytes were  repleted and he soon converted to normal
sinus rhythm where he remained.

His chest tube was removed on post op day #1 and serial chest
xrays thereafter showed a gradual increase in fluid accumulation
and at discharge it was about 1/3rd up.  His room air ambulatory
saturations were 99% and in general room air saturations at rest
or with activity were > 94%.  His left thoracotomy was healing
well.

On post op day # 2 he developed a rash which progressed over the
next few days.  It was on his back, palms of hands and forearms
as well as back of the knees and thighs.  It was vesicular on an
erythematous base, itchy and seemed to be occurring at "moist "
areas.  The Dermatology service was consulted and felt it was a
contact dermatitis as opposed to histamine effect.
Triamcinolone was recommended and after 24 hours it started to
recede.  He will continue this treatment for 2 weeks and if his
symptoms get worse, he will call the [**Hospital 2652**] Clinic. The
culprit was never identified.

As he continued to progress well, he was discharged to home on
[**2137-8-6**] with VNA services and will follow up in the Thoracic
Clinic in 2 weeks.
