History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo male with h/o Meneire's, syncope s/p pacemaker,
BPH, who presented to ED on [**4-15**] with malaise and worsening
shaking movements and found to have an NSTEMI. Pt says that the
day prior he woke up "shaking" and with dizziness. It was not
true vertigo but pt felt as though "my head was spinning." It
was difficult for him to get out of bed. +cough with some yellow
sputum and nasal congestion. No SOB when walks, though pt was
unable to walk [**3-13**] above. Normally, he is able to walk blocks
without a problem. [**Name (NI) **] orthopnea/PND. No chest pain. No
F/C/muscle aches. Pt is unable to say if he has had these
shaking movements before.
.
In the ED, VS on arrival were T: 100.4; HR: 97; BP: 110/56; RR:
24; O2: 96 RA. He was given 1 L NS. He was found to have an
NSTEMI with troponin of 3.27, CK 383, MB 55. He was given 325 mg
ASA, metoprolol 5 mg IV, metoprolol 12.5 mg po, simvastatin 80
mg po. Cardiology fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and agreed with [**Name (NI) **].
Heparin gtt and integrillin were started. Pt remained in the ED
overnight and was stable throught the day awaiting a bed. Pt
subsequently had a guaiac positive black stool. PTT was 54.9.
Heparin and Integrillin gtts were stopped. Pt had 3 more stools
that were melanotic. Was given a 500cc NS bolus, and 40mg IV
protonix. NG tube was placed and revealed 400cc maroon colored
blood. NG tube was left to intermittent suction. He was
transfused 1 unit pRBC's. GI was consulted and pt refused
endoscopy.
.
In the MICU, the pt's NSTEMI was treated conservatively (ASA,
BB, statin) as the pt did not want cardiac cath. He was
transfused an additional unit of PRBC's. He was also found to
have an infiltrate on CXR, and was placed on Abx. Pt's hct
remained stable after anticoagulation was stopped. He is now
being transferred to the floor.
.
Today, pt denies SOB or chest pain.

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
.
3/0/06 TTE:
Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
2. The aortic root is moderately dilated.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

2. Prior asbestos exposure causing diffuse pleural
calcification, unchanged.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2188-4-18**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2188-4-18**]):
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    ~5000/ML.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o meniere's disease and syncope s/p pacemaker
placement who presented with NSTEMI and likely UGIB in setting
of anticoagulation with heparin and integrillin. Heparin and
integrillin were stopped, and pt's hct has remained relatively
stable (pt received total 3 U PRBC's to keep hct>30).
.
# GI bleeding: likely UGIB [**3-13**] underlying ulcer vs. malignancy
vs. AVM vs. varices in setting of anticoagulation with heparin
and integrillin. GI service followed, however pt refussed
endoscopy.  The decisions was made to stop the pt's integrillin
