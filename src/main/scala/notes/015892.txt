Motrin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5827**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall and dyspnea/hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.

History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 yo female w/ hx of AS, Afib, HTN, and dementia who
was transferred from the MICU after presenting to the ED the day
before with SOB secondary to CHF and s/p unwitnessed fall.  On
the day of ED presentation, pt was found down by son at [**Hospital 4382**] home; pt was reportedly diaphoretic, increasingly
confused, and in respiratory distress. There was no associated
fever, chills, or cough. There was no LOC evident.  The son, who
is the primary historian and HCP, reported that the pt had
increasing mental status changes in the last week, secondary to
changing medications, and was noted to have increasing falls by
ALH staff.  Last hospitalization for CVA was [**4-26**], in which
medications were titrated.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt had 02 sats in 70s on RA, which improved to 99 on
NRB, rectal T of 102 w/ lactate of 2.9.  A foley catheter was
placed and pt received levaquin 500 mg IV, ceftaz 1 g IV, 10 mg
Decadron, and 20 IV lasix IV x2.  She was subsequently admitted
to the MICU.

Past Medical History:
DM
A fib, w/ coumadin, rate controlled with BB and ditalizem
Osteoperosis
HTN
AS, no hx of syncope
Dementia, s/p CVA [**4-26**]
Temporal Arteritis
Recurrent falls

Social History:
Pt. lives at [**Hospital3 **] community after CVA [**4-26**].  Son is
HCP and makes major decisions for mother.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:
VS: Temp: 96.5 BP: 130/72 HR: 119 RR: 22 O2sat: 93% on 3L NC
GEN: elderly woman in NAD
HEENT: MMM, neck supple
RESP: diffuse crackles but good air movement
CV: irregular, [**1-24**] sys murmur at RUSB, late peaking
ABD: soft, NT, ND, + BS
EXT: trace edema to shin BL, 2+ DP pulses, erythema over
bilateral knees with abrasions

Pertinent Results:
[**7-16**] Head CT :
IMPRESSION:
1.  No hemorrhage or mass effect.
2.  Severe periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodensities
consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.

[**7-16**] CT spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or abnormal alignment.
2. Moderate degenerative change of the cervical spine.

[**7-16**] CXR:
There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
There are moderates sized perihilar opacities. There is some
mild cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature. These findings
are consistent with moderate CHF. Aortic knob calcifications are
present. Impression: Moderate CHF with bilateral pleural
effusions. Cannot exclude underlying pneumonia within the lower
lobes.

[**7-17**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the previous study from [**7-16**], [**2190**].
Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. There is calcification of the
thoracic aorta, unchanged. Mitral annulus calcification is also
seen. There are again seen persistent pleural effusions, right
side greater than left, which are unchanged. There is pulmonary
edema which is also stable.

[**7-18**] CXR:
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Compared to prior radiograph from
[**2191-7-17**], given difference in technique, there is no
significant change of the right-sided pleural effusion. Small
left-sided pleural effusion remains unchanged. Stable appearance
of bibasilar atelectasis. No new consolidations. Heart size
remains mildly enlarged with upper zone redistribution of
pulmonary blood flow consistent with mild CHF. The mediastinal
and hilar contours are stable. IMPRESSION: Unchanged right-sided
pleural effusion and cephalization of pulmonary blood flow
consistent with mild CHF.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  CHF/SOB: Pt. presented w/ dyspnea upon admission.  The
causes of her dyspnea was likely due to both an infectious
etiology (PNA)given her leukocytosis and acute CHF exacerbation.
On physical exam, pt had elevated JVP w/ trace edema, decreased
breath sounds, dullness to precussion, and diffuse crackles;
pleural effusions and pulmonary edema on CXR. The CXR could not
exclude a PNA give the pleural effusions. Her lab values
included elevated BNP levels ([**Numeric Identifier 19337**]) and WBC at 15.4.  These
finding suggest an infectious etiology as well as CHF. Therfore,
given her UA and blood cultures were negative, she was treated
empirically for CAP.
The CHF is secondary to HTN and aortic stenosis (last measured
on [**2191-4-21**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] at 0.6); the cause of her CHF exacerbation
is still unclear although a dx of PNA or a run of her atrial
fibrillation may have contributed. Upon admission, the pt was
gently diuresed with Lasix 20 mg PO daily that was subsequently
increased to 40 mg PO daily.  Pt. responded well to the diuresis
with decreased JVP, maintained BPs, and was oxygenating at 94%
on 2L on discharge.  Pt's lasix dosage was reduced to 20 mg PO
daily to prevent overdiuresis and should be continued on that
dosage s/p discharge.  Pt. should also be discharged w/ O2,
which can be titrated off as tolerated by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
2. Leukocytosis: This is likely due to CAP. UA was negative with
negative urine and blood cultures. CXR could not exclude PNA
given effusions. The patient was treated empirically with
levofloxacin 250 mg QD for a ten day course. Upon discharge the
patient's WBC ct had fallen to 9.4 and she was afebrile.
.
3. Afib: Pt. was dx with Afib after [**2191-4-21**] admission at [**Hospital1 2025**]
for CVA.  Pt. had an irregularly irregular heart rate w/ 3/6 SEM
in RUSB that was unchanged.  Pt was continued on outpatient
medications of metoprolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] and diltizem.  Dilt was
originally 180 XR PO daily, but was increased to 300 XR PO daily
because of increases in her heart rate.  Her heart rate
continued to trend upwards, thus prompting increases in her dilt
(highest dose 360); the pt. then bradyed down to 40s and was
restarted at her outpt dose of 180 mg Diltiazem. metoprolol was
continued at 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Upon discharge, pt. had atrial
fibrillation and heart rate of 80s.  She should continue to
receive 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] metoprolol and 180 mg XR PO daily dilt. Per
attending recs, we will start the patient on digoxin 0.25 mcg QD
x 2 days then 0.125 mg QD ongoing. We called the patient's PCP's
office to make a follow up appointment and were informed that
she will be followed by the [**Last Name (un) 2299**] house physicians and then by
her PCP's attending group when she return to her [**Hospital3 **]
facility.
.
3.  Aortic Stenosis: Pt. was admitted w/ AS of 0.6 sqcm and a
3/6 SEM, heard best in the RUSB.  Records from the [**Hospital 2025**] hospital
from [**2191-4-21**] confirm diffuse valvular disease in the MR, TR,
and AS; ejection fraction at this time is 69%.  No repeat echo
was done considering her last echo was in [**Month (only) **].  Pt. is preload
dependent and should be carefully monitored for volume
depletion. Upon discharge, she was maintained on 20 mg PO lasix.

.
4.  DM: Pt. had outpatient issue of DM and was continued on a
sliding scale of insulin as well as metformin at
