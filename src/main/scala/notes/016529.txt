Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
84M h/o COPD, dCHF, AF, AS valve area 0.7, s/p superior
segmentectomy of right lower lobe [**12/2158**], c/o dyspnea and cough.
.
He was seen initially at [**Hospital 4628**] hospital where sats noted as
high 80s-low 90s on 3L with borderline trop (0.08 which is
[**Hospital1 5075**] reference cutoff). BNP there 734 by report. CXR
there also showed pna, but he was not treated there. Given trop,
cards at OSH was called however defferred cath since INR 3.5.
Patient was given aspirin, steroids, and Lasix 40mg (approx 5
hours PTA here).  Also had CT head/cspine (both negative) for
fall 1 week ago.
.
On arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], VS were: 98.6, 76, 107/57, 16,
hypoxic in the mid 80s on 3 L, but mentating very well and says
he feels relatively well. Lungs had  minimal crackles at
bilateral bases.
.
Creatinine 1.2 (baseline 0.9-1.0).  CBC 8.5 95% N/37.8/312.  UA
was negative.  ABG was 7.38/33/132 on NRB 100%.  Lactate 1.5.
INR 3.6. Trop was 0.07. CXR consistent with pneumonia.  ED
resident thinks no ST changes on EKG.  Blood cultures were sent.
Patient was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5076**] who agrees that this may be
pneumonia and demand and recommends diuresis and that he may
need cath if does not improve medically.  He was given
Levofloxacin 750mg before transfer to ICU.
.
VS on transfer: afebrile (99), 71, 117/70s, mid 20s, 98% on NRB.
 BP low to mid 90s when arrived per ED resident.  Access is 2
18G IV. Tried titrating down on oxygen a couple of hours ago and
did not tolerate it.
.
On the floor, history is obtained from the patient and his son.
They state that since his wife's passing on [**7-14**] he has not been
doing well but denies dyspnea or CP during that time. His
daughter moved from [**Name (NI) 108**] and has been living with him and
helping with his medications.  He has not missed any medications
nor had any changes except an antidepressant. Patient did have a
fall [**7-21**] when he had been drinking wine and fell over a dining
room chair after he tripped. He was evaluated in the ED the next
day and had neg CT scans.   Day prior to admission he was doing
well, did yard work and then took 3 cans of prune juice because
of constipation. (Children report he takes a lot of OTC stool
meds.) He then had multiple unknown number of episodes of
diarrhea yesterday and last night. No fevers or chills, no
cough. His son states that the patient told him that he awoke at
4am with pain up and down his epigastrum which resolved. No back
pain.  He then went back to bed and his son found him this
morning at 8:30am sitting in a chair and pale. He was unsteady
and not very responsive.  No history of stroke or CVA.
Currently, he states that he feels much improved though has been
dyspneic for the past day since doing the yardwork.  No chest
pain at all.  No swelling. + Cough, no sputum. Home sat is
90-91% without home oxygen need.

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2159-8-1**]

Comparison with a CT chest from [**2159-5-11**] as well as a chest
radiograph from
[**2159-2-8**].

CLINICAL HISTORY: Hypoxia, question acute process in the chest.

FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.
Slight increase
in vague opacities involving the mid-to-lower lungs are
increased from the
prior radiograph and could reflect underpenetration and poor
technique, though
the possibility of pneumonia is difficult to exclude. Suture
material in the
right perihilar region is unchanged. No large pleural effusion
is seen.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. No pneumothorax. Bony
structures are
grossly intact.

IMPRESSION: Limited study with subtle increased opacity
involving the
mid-to-lower lungs bilaterally, may reflect pneumonia. Consider
more
optimized technique with dedicated PA and lateral views to more
clearly and
thoroughly assess.

Approved: WED [**2159-8-1**] 2:27 PM

TTE [**8-2**]
The left atrium is dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%) with possible mild inferolateral hypokinesis.
Cannot exclude other focal wall motion abnormality due to
suboptimal views. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is probably severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2); estimation limited by
suboptimal left ventricular outflow tract Doppler recordings and
uncertainty in measurement of the left ventricular outflow tract
diameter. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen but may be
underestimated. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-12-15**],
the aortic valve gradient is similar.
