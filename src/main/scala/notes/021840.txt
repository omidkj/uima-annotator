History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with multiple chronic medical problems
presenting with a several week history of wet, produtive cough,
shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, hypoxia and abnormal
chest x-ray. Several weeks ago, Ms. [**Known lastname 7336**] developed fever,
chest congestion and shortness of breath. She had several Xray
evaluations which demonstrated focal nodular abnormality of the
RUL and extensive abnormal density at the lung bases with
pleural disease and low lung volumes. Over time, the lung base
lesions increased and small effusions developed. She was treated
with antibiotics--levofloxacin, then clindamycin then
combination Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone and Flagyl (day 1 [**2195-6-13**]).
Follow up CXR on [**6-25**] was without significant change. During
this time, she also had evaluation for influenza and was treated
with oseltamivir for 2 days, but this was discontinued, as the
H1N1 evaluation was negative.
.
Despite treatment with antimicrobials and supportive
medications, the patient failed to improve clinically or on
imaging. She continued to have a wet productive cough, low grade
fever, night sweats, poor appetite (progressive over disease
course) and hypoxia since [**5-16**].

In the ED, vitals were: 98.1 96/65 100 18 99% 4L NC. Her BP
remained low throughout the ED course 78-106/39-51. She was
given ceftriaxone, flagyl, asa 325 mg and 2 L IVF and admitted
to the ICU for hypotension.

Currently, she is bothered only by her cough, otherwise, she is
feeling well.

STUDIES:
========
[**6-25**] PORTABLE CXR: IMPRESSION: Nonspecific lung opacities
predominante in the lung bases but also affect the right upper
lobe. The differential diagnosis includes infectious,
inflammatory, and neoplastic process. Recommend CT chest for
further evaluation.

[**6-25**] CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
Multifocal airspace consolidation with airbronchograms in the
bilateral lower lobes concerning for superimposed infection.
Known right apical mass
increasing in size with newly apparent left apical mass highly
concerning for neoplasm. Ill-defined soft tissue densities
posterior to the kidneys, stable since prior examinations.
Stable AAA status post stent.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with multiple chronic medical problems
presenting with 3 weeks of pulmonary symptoms and hypoxia
without improvement.

1. Hypotension: Clinically, appeared most consistent with
dehydration.  Bolused IVFs on night of admission with
appropriate BP response.

2. Lung masses: CT showed known right apical mass increasing in
size with newly apparent left apical mass highly concerning for
neoplasm.  In [**8-15**], CT then had noted R apical mass and positive
PET concerning for malignancy.  Also noted to have thyroid
lesion.  Discussed findings with family.  Patient was too
tenuous for bronchoscopy given high oxygen requirment.  Family
meeting completed and she was confirmed DNR/DNI as well comfort
being paramount goal.  She was started on tessalon perles and
morphine IV prn. At rehab, please continue oxygen
supplmenentation.

3. Pneumonia: Likely post-obstructive.  PCN allergy.  Planned 7
day course of levofloxacin and flagyl.  day # 1 is [**2195-6-27**].

4. Atrial fibrillation: HR usually in 100s per [**Hospital1 1501**] as well as
during ICU hospitalization.  Continued rate control with nodal
agents as in the d/c medication list.

5. AAA s/p repari: Initially held ASA and plavix, but as no
procedure, restarted these upon discharge.

6. CHF: clinically dry on exam, no need for diuretics.

7. Chronic pain: Continued oxycontin, gabapentin, acetaminophen.
Continue bowel regimen. Patient reports having stools.

8. Osteoporosis: ca/vit D.

9. Chronic renal insufficiency: at baseline

10. Anemia: at baseline

11. Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic hyponatremia, resolved in
AM after IVFs
