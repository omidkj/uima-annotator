History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83669**] is a 48 year-old man with dilated
cardiomyopathy (EF 25%) on coumadin, s/p ICD in [**2117**], HTN, CKD
(baseline Cr 1.3-1.6) and asthma who presents with syncope.
.
The patient was recently discharged on [**2120-2-11**] for acute on
chronic CHF after receiving aggressive diuresis. He then
continued to develop abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomitting,
and he was unable to keep his medications down. He then
developed worsening coughing spells, and it was in the setting
of a severe coughing spell when he had a witnesssed syncopal
event for about 7 seconds. Per the patient's mother, the patient
was pale and cyanotic. He quickly recovered and was sent to the
ER who admitted him to the cardiology service.
.
On the cardiology service his abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting
was felt to be secondary to congestive hepatopathy, his cough
due to CHF vs asthma, and his syncope was felt to be secondary
to a coughing spell leading to increased intra-abdominal
pressures and therefore reduced preload in the setting of
low-output state. His ICD interrogation was negative for any
events. He was aggressively diuresed with a net 10 liters
negative since admission. He underwent RHC for milrinone trial,
which proved to be successful. His mean PCW went from 30 to 22,
and his Fick C.I. went from 1.72 to 2.79.
.
On the floor he is complaining of a frontal headache. He denies
weakness, speech/vision problems, seizures, nausea, vomitting,
unilaterality, photophobia/phonophobia. He denies chest pain or
shortness of breath. He also gives a several month history of
significant BRBPR. He had a colonoscopy for this in [**2117**] which
showed polyps that were removed. He recently saw GI who felt his
bleeding was likely due to internal hemorrhoids or a fissure and
referred him to colorectal surgery, who he has not yet seen.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations.

[**2-20**] ADMISSION EKG - NSR 76
Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats. Borderline P-R
interval
prolongation. Low limb lead voltage. There is somewhat late R
wave
progression. Since the previous tracing probably no significant
change.
.
[**2-20**] ADMISSION CXR
FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The lungs are clear. There
is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There is no vascular
congestion or pleural effusions. Mediastinal and hilar contours
are within normal limits.
Moderately severe cardiomegaly is unchanged compared to prior
examination. An AICD generator overlies the left chest wall. The
lead appears intact,
terminating in the expected location of the right ventricle.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly consistent with
history of known cardiomyopathy. No pulmonary edema, pleural
effusion, or focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
.
[**2-20**] ADMISSION CT HEAD
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no hemorrhage, mass, mass effect,
or acute
large territorial infarction. There is no shift of the usually
midline
structures. The suprasellar and basilar cisterns are widely
patent. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved throughout. There
is a moderate soft tissue thickening in the subcutaneous tissues
of the left occiput, which is unchanged from prior examination.
No acute hematoma or skull fracture is identified.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
[**2-21**] CT ABD/PELVIS
ABDOMEN:
The lung bases are clear without focal lesion. There is moderate
cardiomegaly. A pacemaker wire terminates in the right
ventricle, unchanged.
The heart is otherwise unremarkable. The pleura and pericardium
are intact
without effusion.
Evaluation of intra-abdominal organs is limited by lack of IV
contrast.
Within these limitations, the liver appears unremarkable without
focal or
diffuse abnormality. The gallbladder is normal. No intra- or
extra-hepatic
bile duct dilatation. The pancreas appears within normal limits.
The spleen
appears unremarkable. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.
Bilateral kidneys are unremarkable.
The esophagus and stomach are normal. The small and large bowel
are normal in course and caliber. Oral contrast reaches the
rectum. Colonic diverticulosis is present without evidence of
diverticulitis. The appendix is normal and filled with air.
A small amount of fluid is present in perisplenic and
perihepatic regions.
