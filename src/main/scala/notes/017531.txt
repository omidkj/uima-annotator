history of systemic lupus erythematosus, hypertension and
BOOP, who came to the Emergency Department on [**2183-3-12**]
for cough of two weeks duration and subsequently went into
hypoxic respiratory arrest, was intubated, and transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Over the two weeks prior to
admission, Mrs. [**Known lastname 5655**] complained of increasing shortness of
breath with a cough productive of yellow sputum, flecked with

became tachypneic, short of breath, confused and pulse
oximetry could not be obtained.  She continued to be very
short of breath on 100% nonrebreather.  She was intubated for
presumed respiratory failure and transported to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE
UNIT:  General:  intubated, sedated, middle-aged woman.
Vital signs:  Blood pressure 140/90.  Heart rate 130.
Temperature 99.1.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  Sclerae are anicteric.
Neck, supple, no LAD.  Chest:  bilateral breath sounds
anteriorly.  No wheezing.  Coarse bilateral breath sounds
throughout.  Inspiratory crackles.  Cardiovascular:
tachycardic rhythm, no murmurs.  Abdomen:  soft, nontender,
nondistended, normal active bowel sounds.  Light brown guaiac
negative stool.  Extremities:  warm without edema.  Neuro:
Babinski downgoing bilaterally.  Sedated.  Symmetric
reflexes.

LABORATORIES VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count
2.6, differential 57 neutrophils, 2 basophils, 25
lymphocytes, 9 macrophages.  Hematocrit 28.2, platelets
142,000.  MCV 82.  Sodium 138, potassium 3.7, chloride 98,
bicarbonate 28, BUN 27, creatinine 7.1, glucose 82.
Urinalysis: small amount of blood.  Greater than 300 protein.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While in the Emergency Department, Mrs.
[**Known lastname 5655**] received nitroglycerin paste, Lasix 80 mg intravenous,
500 mg levofloxacin, heparin per protocol, Versed 1-2 mg per
hour via IV drip.  After intubation in the Emergency
Department, Mrs. [**Known lastname 5655**] received a bedside echocardiogram
which showed severe left ventricular systolic functional
depression and a small loculated pericardial effusion.  Right
ventricular diastolic collapse was present consistent with
impaired filling and tamponade.  A chest x-ray at the time
showed congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema,
although pneumonia could not be excluded.  An
electrocardiogram revealed T wave inversions laterally.  Mrs.
[**Known lastname 5655**] then underwent CT angiography for pulmonary embolus
which was negative; however, the CT showed fluid overload
with left and right pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.

After intubation and in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, Mrs.
[**Known lastname 5655**] was initially placed on SIMV plus PFs, but was not
well sedated and had rapid respiration rate.  An arterial
blood gas at the time post intubation was 7.18/55/76.  The
patient was switched to ACV/500/14/FIO2 100% with PEEP of
7.5.  Arterial blood gases then was 7.24/56/57.

Initial differential diagnosis at the time of admission to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit was infectious community-
acquired pneumonia versus lupus pneumonitis versus flash
pulmonary edema or congestive heart failure.  During her stay
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, Mrs. [**Known lastname 5655**] showed rapid
improvement.  On [**3-12**], she was started on Solu-Medrol
intravenous 80 mg q. 8 hours, Lasix 40 mg q.d. and
levofloxacin 500 mg q.d.  By [**3-14**], Solu-Medrol had been
changed to 60 mg intravenous q. 8 hours.  By [**3-15**], to 40
mg intravenous q. 8 hours.  She continued with Lasix at 40 mg
q.d. and levofloxacin at 500 mg q.d.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 5655**] was extubated on [**3-14**] with adequate 02
saturation.  By [**3-15**], a chest x-ray showed significant
interval improvement of pulmonary edema with an accompanying
decrease in the size of her pleural effusions.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 5655**]
was then discharged to the Medicine [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-15**].
