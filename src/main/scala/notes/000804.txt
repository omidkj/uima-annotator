HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 77 year old male had an
abnormal electrocardiogram at a recent routine visit with his
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had been having increasing
fatigue for greater than one year and dyspnea on exertion
also for greater than one year.  His stress test was positive
after his abnormal electrocardiogram.  He had a cardiac
catheterization performed at [**Hospital6 3872**] in
late [**2102-9-22**], which showed left anterior descending
coronary artery 90 percent lesion, diagonal two 90 percent
lesion, diagonal three 60 percent lesion, circumflex 90
percent lesion, right coronary artery 70 to 75 percent
lesion., posterior descending coronary artery 60 percent
lesion and an ejection fraction of 40 percent, a dilated
aortic root and mildly elevated left ventricular end
diastolic pressure.  Cardiac catheterization done in [**2101-6-21**], showed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent with
mild mitral regurgitation.  The patient was admitted to the
hospital on [**2102-11-10**], in preparation for his surgery.  He
was to be done electively but called complaining of shortness
of breath so the patient was admitted to the hospital.

3. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. daily.
4. Reglan 10 mg p.o. daily.

7. Glucosamine combination drug p.o. daily.
8. Prilosec p.r.n.


ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, he was sitting up in
bed in no apparent distress.  He was alert and oriented times
three and appropriate.  He had crackles of his right base and
diminished breath sounds of his left base.  His heart was
regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2 and grade II/VI
systolic ejection murmur.  His abdomen was soft, round,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.  His
extremities were warm and well perfused with trace edema
bilaterally.  He had two plus bilateral radial, dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  His preoperative laboratories were as
follows:  White blood cell count 7.3, hematocrit 46.7,
platelet count 419,000.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride
100, bicarbonate 29, blood urea nitrogen 19, creatinine 1.0
with a blood sugar of 61.  His HbA1C was 4.9 percent.
Prothrombin time 12.3, partial thromboplastin time 27.7, INR
1.0.  ALT 21, AST 24, alkaline phosphatase 90, total
bilirubin 0.6, albumin 4.6.  Preoperative urinalysis was
negative.  His preoperative chest x-ray showed no acute
cardiopulmonary process.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  He was given intravenous Lasix for diuresis
prior to surgery.  The next day, [**2102-11-11**], the patient
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times four by Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] with left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to
the posterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein
graft to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal. He was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition on Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.3
mcg/kg/minute, a Dobutamine drip at 3.0 mcg/kg/minute and a
Propofol drip at 10 mcg/kg/minute.  On postoperative day
number one, the patient had been extubated overnight.  He was
given volume, remained on Dobutamine drip at 3.0 and the Neo-
Synephrine drip had been weaned off.  He was also on insulin
drip at 4 units per hour.  Aspirin was restarted.
Postoperative white blood cell count was 12.1, hematocrit
27.0, potassium 4.4, blood urea nitrogen 15, creatinine 1.0.
He was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 109/58
and in sinus tachycardia at 103.  On postoperative day number
two, he had been transfused one unit of packed red blood
cells for a hematocrit of 24.0, remained in sinus rhythm with
no other significant events.  He began intravenous Lasix
diuresis 20 mg twice a day.  His examination was
unremarkable.  His creatinine remained stable at 1.0.  He
started his beta blocker.  His Swan-Ganz was discontinued and
he was transferred out to the floor.  On postoperative day
number three, the patient was ambulating independently on the
floor although complaining of a little bit of weakness.  He
had a full evaluation done by physical therapy.  He remained
stable.  His hematocrit rose to 28.7.  He had good blood
pressure.  His examination was unremarkable with trace
peripheral edema.  His incisions were clean, dry and intact.
His pacing wires remained in place.  His chest tubes had
minimal drainage.  His chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued later in the day without incident.  The patient
was encouraged to increase his p.o. intake and increase his
level of activity by increased amounts of ambulation.  He was
receiving Percocet which gave him nausea, so this was
switched over to Tylenol number three for pain.  On
postoperative day number four, the patient continued to
progress very well and was waiting to do a complete level
five prior to his discharge.  His beta blocker was increased
to Lopressor 50 mg twice a day.  He was receiving p.o.
Tylenol with Codeine for pain management.  His lungs were
rhonchorous but his examination was otherwise unremarkable.
He was alert and oriented with a nonfocal neurologic
examination.  On postoperative day number five, he was doing
very well but had some persistent tachycardia with a heart
rate in the 90 to 105 range.  His Lopressor was discontinued.
He started Toprol 100 mg p.o. daily.  He was alert and
oriented.  This was changed at patient request for the
simplicity of once a day dosing.  His creatinine remained
stable at 0.9.  He had occasional premature ventricular
contractions with couplets and a six beat run of
supraventricular tachycardia at 11:00 p.m. on the evening of
[**2102-11-17**], without any symptoms whatsoever, was saturating
94 to 97 percent in room air with decreased breath sounds at
his bases.  The following morning the day of discharge, he
was in sinus rhythm at 84 beats per minute with a temperature
maximum of 98.9, blood pressure 120/63.  Laboratories the day
prior were white blood cell count 8.3, hematocrit 29.3,
platelet count 386,000, potassium 4.0, blood urea nitrogen
20, creatinine 0.9.  He had small blisters on his right
distal leg incision.  His examination was otherwise
unremarkable other than some rhonchorous sounds in his
bilateral lung bases but he was much improved with better
heart rate control and the patient was deemed able to go home
with VNA services and was discharged on [**2102-11-17**].
