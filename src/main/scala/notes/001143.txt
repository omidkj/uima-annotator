Attending:[**Last Name (un) 11974**]
Chief Complaint:
palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ventricular tachycardia ablation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90719**] is a 75yo female who initially presented to an OSH
with palpitations. Her AICD fired and she was noted to be in
recurrent v-tach at the OSH ED. She denies CP and SOB.
OSH Course:
She was transferred to the CCU at the OSH and had recurrent
episodes of v-tach with AICD pacing her. Subsequently, her
v-tach resolved spontaneously. In the CCU at the OSH, her vitals
at presentation were 130/90 HR 70-130 (tachycardia was
ventricular tachycardia) T98 RR 20 and satting 96% on RA.
Reportedly, device interrogation demonstrated recurrent runs of
ventricular tachycardia, some of which were pace-terminated but
one of them required of electrical cardioversion on [**2163-10-1**]. CXR
showed cardiomegaly but no lung pathology and EKG with
ventricular tachycardiat at 129 beats per minute, left bundle
branch with superior axis with atypical right bundle branch in
leads V1 and V2. The patient had WBC of 7 and hct of 34 with a
negative troponin and CPK times two, and K 3.4 and Mg 2.0. The
ICD was adjusted, enabling adaptive and pacing thresholds as
well as lowering the detection rate of slow ventricular
tachycardia zone from 140-120 beats per minute. The patient was
started on quinidine 324mg [**Hospital1 **] and her home dose of metoprolol
from 150mg [**Hospital1 **] to 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
Vitals on transfer were T 97 HR 70 BP 123/72 RR 18 O2 Sat: 97%
RA
.
On arrival to the floor, patient reported that she is tired, but
is asymptomatic. She denies CP, SOB. She reports ongoing
intermittent palpitations but has never had LOC. She says that
she feels well and is looking forward to her ablation so she can
"stop feeling this way." She does endorse dyspnea on exertion,
which she says is unchanged from her.

Brief Hospital Course:
71yo female with significant past cardiac history presenting s/p
ablation for ventricular tachycardia, now with ongoing
hypotension and malaise.
.
ACUTE CARE
# RHYTHM: Initially presented with paroxysmal ventricular
tachycardia, for which she would receive ICD firings. She is s/p
ablation but did have VT on the table so it may not have been
successful. Patient is refusing amiodarone due to history of QT
prolongation. She has had [**4-2**] nonsustained beats of vtach, which
the patient reports some fluttering at the time of these
findings. Mexiletine was started [**10-11**], with improvement in blood
pressures (previously had been symptomatically hypotensive to
the systolic 80s with feelings of "dizziness and weakness" and
some orthostatic hypotension).
.
# CORONARIES: known CAD. Medically managed and s/p PCI.
Continued [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], BB, statin. Stopped Imdur as the patient
is not having anginal chest pain. She presented on Metoprolol
tartrate 150mg [**Hospital1 **] but was not tolerating this dose after her
ablation and is on a lower dose of metoprolol tartrate now, 25mg
[**Hospital1 **]. She had not previously been on an [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Lisinopril 5mg
was started. Lipids not at goal with LDL of 141 in setting of hx
of CAD, continue statin therapy, consider uptitration of statin.

.
# UTI: Bactrim started [**10-8**], completed a 5 day course. Culture
did show e. coli which was sensitive to bactrim. Patient was asx
and it was an incidental finding.
.
# PUMP: CHF with EF of 35%. Currently optimized and not
fluid-overloaded, not symptomatic.  Continued Aldactone. The
patient did have hypokalemia prior to starting her Aldactone but
this was resolved after introduction of the aldactone. She could
not tolerate Lasix, as her hypotension was limiting. She is
being discharged without this medication, but it could be
restarted in the outpatient setting.
.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: currently asx, on home regimen of
levothyroxine, the patient is s/p thyroidectomy. TSH elevated at
6.6, will allow for outpatient f/u because we will do not
increase synthroid in the inpatient setting.
.
CHRONIC CARE
# GERD:  continued Ranitidine.  Not symptomatic during
hospitalization.
.
#COPD:  continued Spiriva
.
# PSYCH: insomnia and anxiety-continued home ambien 5mg qhs. She
did have significant anxiety in the setting of her ICD firing
and the procedure and benefited from her home dose of Lorazepam
0.5mg prn 6h anxiety in setting of procedure.
