Brief Hospital Course:
1.  traumatic brain injury/ right subdural hemorrhage:
Pt was admitted on [**2188-5-30**] and was unresponsive with fixed
pupils.  Emergent CT revealed a large acute R subdural hematoma
with subfalcine and uncal herniation, as well as fractures of
the right frontoparietal calvarium and left lamina papyracea.
Pt was taken to the OR for emergent evacuation.  He underwent a
R craniectomy with evacuation of subdural hemorrhage and
frontotemporal lobectomy.  He was transferred to the trauma
surgery ICU for further care and was begun on mannitol to lower
ICP (discontinued [**6-4**]) and dilantin to prevent seizure
(discontinued [**6-6**]).

Pt was closely followed but remained basically unresponsive.
Sedation was weaned, but pt remained basically unresponsive and
without spontaneous movement, gag, or corneal reflexes.  Pt was
noted to have extensor posturing to painful stimuli on upper
extremities.  A neurology consult was called to help evaluate
for prognosis.   On [**6-17**], an EEG showed R hemispheric
subcortical dysfunction and mild encephalopathy, without
evidence of ongoing seizure.  It was thought that his prognosis
ranged from limited verbal abilities and a dense left
hemiparesis to a persistent vegetative state.  Pt was
transferred to the floor on [**7-12**], where he continued to be
followed by neurology and neurosurgery.  Multiple family
meetings were held throughout [**Hospital 228**] hospital course to
discuss the prognosis, both in the TSICU and on the floor, in
conjunction with social work.

On [**7-13**], pt was noted to have fluid draining from the wound
site.  This was felt to be necrotic brain fluid.  Neurosurgery
placed additional sutures on [**7-16**], and the issue resolved.
Serial head CTs were performed to evaluate for interval changes.
 On [**7-17**], head CT showed increased size of the ventricles after
the ventricular drain had been removed; neurosurgery did not
believe that this represented an increase in ICP.  There were
intermittent changes in the amount of bulging at the R
craniectomy site, thought to represent liquefaction necrosis as
well as hydrocephalus. On [**8-27**], the amount of bulging was
significantly greater, and another head CT was performed, which
showed significantly worsening hydrocephalus.  On [**9-1**],
therefore, a VP shunt was placed, and a repeat head CT on [**9-3**]
showed interval improvement of the hydrocephalus.

In mid-[**Month (only) 359**], pt was noted to have slow improvement of mental
status, and was able to respond to voice, move his R fingers,
and begin to follow simple commands.  His family continued to
work with him, and he slowly improved.  Eventually, he was able
to answer yes/no questions with finger movements and to follow
more commands.

On [**9-30**], repeat head CT showed foci of relative [**Name (NI) 13215**]
within the right temporal lobe, which could be consistent with
parenchymal hemorrhage, but pt's hydrocephalus was improved.  As
pt was reporting headaches, another CT was performed on [**10-3**],
which revealed an area of acute hemorrhage inferior to the
frontal portion of the infarct along the inferior edge of the
craniotomy, more dense than on the previous CT.  Neurosurgery
felt there was no indication for surgical intervention, and this
remained stable on repeat head CT [**10-10**].  Pt had no further
episodes of acute hemorrhage, and overall his neurological
status continued to improve.

On [**10-27**], pt underwent an elective R cranioplasty to repair the
defect in his skull.  He tolerated the procedure well.  Of note,
a repeat head CT on [**10-30**] showed no interval hemorrhage.  Pt will
get a repeat head CT to evaluate for interval bleed on [**12-25**],
and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**].

2.  infectious disease:
A.  POD #4 s/p craniotomy and SDH evacuation - [**2188-5-31**] - pt was
febrile, and sputum grew H. influenza; was started on Zosyn for
aspiration pneumonia.  Repeat sputum culture [**6-5**] did not grow H
flu.
B.  suspected encephalitis - Pt treated with levofloxacin
[**Date range (1) 57819**]
C.  MRSA/Pseudomonas pneumonia (LLL) - vancomycin was begun on
[**7-4**], and was given for 3 weeks given the concomitant meningitis
(see below); for Pseudomonal coverage, pt was treated with
ceftazidime 2g IV q8h x 10 days ([**Date range (1) 57820**])
D.  MRSA meningitis/infection of head w
