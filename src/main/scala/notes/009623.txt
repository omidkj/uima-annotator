Admission Date:  [**2187-8-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2187-8-31**]



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old man with
a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ulcerative
colitis, and depressed left ventricular function of
approximately 40%, with inferior wall motion abnormalities
collapsed at a funeral.  Bystanders performed cardiopulmonary
resuscitation as Emergency Medical Service was en route.  The
patient was semiconscious on their arrival.  Heart rate was
90 with no palpable blood pressure noted.  Lungs were clear.
The patient vomited bright red blood and was incontinent of
urine and stool.  Electrocardiogram showed ST elevations
myocardial infarction.  The patient was given aspirin and
typed and crossed for 4 units of packed red blood cells.
Recorded blood pressures were 110/palp and [**Year (4 digits) **] 208
systolic over 173 diastolic.

He was [**Year (4 digits) **] transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] Emergency Room.  There, the electrocardiogram
showed ST elevations of greater than 2 mm in V1 through V3
with reciprocal changes, potassium 5.9, lactate 4.8.  He was
taken to catheterization emergently on presentation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Type 2 diabetes.
3.  Ulcerative colitis.
4.  Angina.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glipizide, Prinivil, atenolol.

ALLERGIES:  SULFA.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history not taken; unobtainable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history was unobtainable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.4, pulse
104 to 127, blood pressure of 69 to 120 systolic over 30 to
60 diastolic, respiratory rate 20 to 28, with oxygen
saturation of 95% to 100% on 100% FIO2 by the ventilator.  In
general, he was an elderly male, ill-appearing, drowsy, but
appropriate.  HEENT revealed pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  OG-tube with blood.
Jugular venous distention pulsations to ear when lying flat.
Pulmonary revealed crackles one-half the way up posteriorly.
Cardiovascular revealed quiet precordium, normal S1 and S2,
with a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended, with hypoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were cool, modeled, with decreased
distal pulses and pail nails bilaterally.  Neurologically,
alert and oriented, answered inappropriately, and the patient
was [**Hospital1 **] sedated on the ventilator.  Lines revealed
he had a right Swan, bilateral upper extremity peripheral
IVs, and a right radial artery line.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:   White blood cell count 12.7,
hematocrit 42.7, platelets 209.  Chem-7 revealed sodium
of 136, potassium 4.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 19, BUN 37,
creatinine 1.4, glucose 332.  Creatine kinase initially
was 77 with a troponin of 2.  Lactate was 4.8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm
at 80, axis -30, left axis deviation, P-R interval 0.182, QRS
greater than 120 msec, ST elevations in V1 through V4, Q wave
in V2, T wave inversion in I and L, borderline left
bundle-branch block.

Chest x-ray showed a good T tube placement with Swan in the
right PA, tortuous aorta, and congestive heart failure that
was deemed mild.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken emergently to the
catheterization laboratory from the Emergency Room and
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit at [**Hospital1 346**] for care of an acute anterior
myocardial infarction.  Creatine kinases [**Hospital1 **] rose to
peak of 5600.

In the catheterization on presentation, he had diffuse
3-vessel disease with a right coronary 80% stenosis, right
posterior diagonal 50% stenosis, right posterolateral 80%
stenosis, proximal left anterior descending artery 80%, mid
left anterior descending artery 80%, distal left anterior
descending artery 80%, first diagonal 100%, circumflex 60%,
first obtuse marginal 95%, second obtuse marginal 95%, third
obtuse marginal 95% stenosis.

Swan-Ganz catheter was placed in the catheterization
laboratory that showed an RA of 10, and the pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 12.  The patient [**Hospital1 **]
had a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
stent placed to the proximal left anterior descending artery
and mid left anterior descending artery.  Mr. [**Known lastname **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed and was
transferred to the unit.  The left anterior descending artery
stent had TIMI-II flow.

The patient was also started on Levophed, and dopamine, and
dobutamine in the Coronary Care Unit.  The Coronary Care Unit
course was complicated by an upper gastrointestinal bleed
with hematocrit initially at 42.7 that [**Last Name (Titles) **] dropped
to 32.7, for which he was transfused 6 units of blood.  The
patient had a temperature spike on hospital day four for
which he was started on levofloxacin, vancomycin,
ceftazidime, and Flagyl.  Cultures found enterococcus in his
urine and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in
his sputum.  Lines were changed, and the antibiotic course
was paired down to levofloxacin and oxacillin.  The patient's
intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued on hospital day
four, and a PA catheter was placed.  Pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure was 16 at that time.

On hospital day five captopril was started with decreased
pressor needs.  He was [**Last Name (Titles) **] diuresed on hospital day
six with a labile blood pressure and ruled out for a VSD by
Swan-Ganz catheter.  He was weaned off pressors completely by
hospital day eight.  He was treated with oxacillin on
[**8-15**] and continued diuresis.  The Swan-Ganz catheter was
discontinued on hospital day 10 and replaced with a triple
lumen.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated on hospital day 12 and found to be
tachypneic with good oxygenation with an arterial blood gas
of 7.41/34/90.  Dopamine was weaned to off on [**8-20**] and
started on digoxin.  He was diuresed on dopamine transiently
and responded well before being sent to the floor.

The patient continued to be tachypneic with an arterial blood
gas of 7.45/33/80 on 6 liters by [**8-21**].  Diuresis
continued; however, on hospital day 15 the patient was found
to be obtunded with a respiratory rate of approximately 50
breaths per minute, hypercarbic, and hypoxic.  The patient
did not respond to Lasix and appeared to have continued
respiratory distress.  He was intubated on the floor and
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit where he was noted to
be febrile and to have pus around his central venous line.
Antibiotics were restarted through his central venous line,
and the catheter line tip was sent.  Left subclavian and
right arterial line were placed.  He was noted to be
hypotensive on the floor prior to intubation at 70s/40s and a
heart rate of 116 to 120.  Prior to transfer to the floor he
was restarted on his dopamine pressor drip.

The following morning a PA catheter was reinstituted to check
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular
resistance.  This was performed with a pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 11 and cardiac index of 2.8.  The patient
was still in cardiac congestive heart failure based on his
Swan numbers and was started on dopamine drip with wean of
the dopamine drip.  On the night of [**8-24**] the patient
self-extubated at approximately 8 p.m. and was felt to be
hemodynamically stable with respiratory rates in the 30s, and
oxygen saturation of 98% on 100% nonrebreather.  The decision
was made to keep the patient extubated and to follow closely.

Over the course of the night the nitroglycerin, dobutamine,
and dopamine drips were weaned over the course of the night
to off.

An echocardiogram performed on [**8-25**] revealed no effusion
and an ejection fraction of less than 25%, consistent with
the patient's congestive heart failure, and status post a
large anterior myocardial infarction.  In consultation with
the patient's family the patient was made DNR not DNI at that
time.

Over the following two days the patient continued to be
tachypneic with pulmonary edema and was diuresed aggressively
with Lasix and morphine for breathing relief.  His ACE
inhibitor continued to be titrated aggressively with
increased
