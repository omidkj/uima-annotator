CHIEF COMPLAINT:  shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  58 year old male with
metastatic renal ca to lung and bone (last chemo [**2145-8-10**]), who
presented to [**Hospital **] clinic on day of admission with 2 days of
shortness of breath with occasional mild confusion, found to be
hypoxic to high 80's on room air.  Wife states that for the past
few weeks, he has had dyspnea on exertion, it had been
attributed to anemia and he received pRBC trasnfusions, however,
shortness of breath became more pronounced over the past 2 days.
 In clinic, he was placed on 4L nasal canula and O2 sat
increased to 93% with resp rate of 40.  He denied any chest pain
or abdominal pain.  He complained of slight cough.  Per wife, he
had fever to 101F at home the night prior to admission but
afebrile in clinic.
.
ED: He was intubated and sedated with fentanyl/versed.  Given
sodium bicarb, calcium chloride, insulin with D50 for K 6.8.
EKG showed low voltage and bedside Echo with pericardial
effusion and tamponade physiology.  CXR with pulm edema,
bilateral pleural effusions.   He was given levofloxacin 750mg
iv x 1 for possible pneumonia. Cardiology was consulted and he
was taken urgently to cath lab where 1260cc straw colored fluid
drained from pericardium.
.
Review of systems limited by patient intubation/sedation.  Per
records and discussion with family, there is no prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain,  paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  (+) shortness of

Onc Hx: Metastatic Renal Cell
1. Nephrectomy for clear cell carcinoma in 09/[**2140**].
2. Resection of a right seventh rib metastasis, which revealed
metastatic high-grade renal cell carcinoma.
3. High-dose IL-2 therapy, which was complicated by the
development of accelerated angina. He is now status post cardiac

catheterization with coronary artery stent placement.
4. CyberKnife therapy to a medial paramediastinal lung lesion.
5. Sutent as a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] begun in 09/[**2144**]. This was
complicated by severe GI side effects and dehydration. The dose
was reduced and despite this reduction, he was admitted in
[**Month (only) 956**] to a local hospital with rapid atrial fibrillation and

associated syncope which resulted in an accident while driving.

He sustained several rib fractures as a result.
6. Currently, cycle 8 of Sutent 2 weeks on/ 1 week off, plus
Gemzar begun because of disease progression.

.
CXR:  Limited study with marked cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema,
and
bilateral pleural effusions, new since the [**8-13**] examination. A
focal
consolidation, particularly on the left, cannot be excluded.
.
ECHO ([**8-25**]):
Large pericardial effusion. RV diastolic collapse, c/w impaired

fillling/tamponade physiology. Significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w
impaired ventricular filling. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). RV systolic function
appears depressed.
.
Cardiac Cath/ Pericardiocentesis ([**8-25**]):
1. Pericardiocentesis revealed initial elevated pericardial
pressure of 35mmHg subsequently decreasing to 13mmHg after
drainage of 1.4 liters of serosanguinous pericardial fluid.
.
ECHO ([**8-26**] - s/p pericardiocentesis)
LV wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral
thinning and hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%). There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
ECHO ([**8-28**]):
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with inferolateral
akinesis and inferior hypokinesis. Overall LV systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). RV size normal. Small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion. There is significant,
accentuated respiratory variation
in mitral valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular
filling. Not right ventricular/right atrial collapse identified.

  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-8-27**],
left ventricular  wall motion abnormlaity appears similar.
Respiratory variation in mitral inflow is unchanged. The
pericaridal effusion is now slightly larger.
.
ECHO ([**8-30**]):
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated. RA pressure is 5-10 mmHg. LV wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Mild regional LV systolic
dysfunction with focal akinesis of the basal half of the
inferolateral wall and hypokinesis of the inferior wall.  RV
size and free wall motion are nl. No valvular disease. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small to
moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion most
prominent around the right atrium. Brief right atrial diastolic
collapse but normal transmitral Doppler spectra.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-8-29**],
the size of the effusion is slightly greater around the right
atrium, but transmitral Doppler no longer suggests impaired
filling. Left ventricular systolic function is similar.



Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 37025**] is a 58 year old male with renal cell
ca with metastases to the lung, bone, liver and right adrenal
who presented with 2 days of increasing shortness of breath.  In
the ER, he was hypoxic and found to have pericardial tamponade.
He got a pericardiocentesis on [**8-25**] with drainage of 1.2 L.
.
Tamponade.  Patient was known to have a pericardial effusion by
CT on [**2145-8-9**] (2 weeks prior to admission.   Echo showed
intermittent RV collapse suggestive of tamponade and a
significant pericardial effusion.  On [**8-25**], Cardiology drained
1300cc of straw colored fluid, which was sent for cytology.  A
repeat echo the morning after pericentesis showed resolution of
the effusion.  Drain output decreased and so the pericardial
drain was removed on [**2145-8-26**].  Serial echocardiograms showed a
gradual reaccumulation of pericardial fluid, but no acute signs
of cardiac tamponade. Co
