Rifampin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
initiation of Remodulin therapy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2172-10-30**] - Placement of a single-lumen tunneled catheter
(Hickman)


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47598**] is a 50 year-old lady with a PMH of cryptogenic
cirrhosis c/b porto-pulmonary hypertension with severe pulmonary
hypertension, who presents for placement of a tunnelled PICC and
initiation of Remodulin treatment.  Patient reports that her
liver disease was diagnosed after her LFTs were checked in [**2157**]
for initiation of an antidepressant.  Subsequently, she had a
biopsy confirming cirrhosis, secondary to PSC, which has been
complicated by portal hypertension, Grade II esophageal varices
and portopulmonary symptoms.  Patient has been treated on
sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension.  Despite treatment, a
right heart cath in [**2172-7-23**] showed severe pulmonary
hypertension with mean PAP 52mmHg, max PASP 86mmHg, PVR 555, and
PCWP 12.  Persistent pulmonary hypertension is precluding liver
transplant; therefore, patient was directly admitted for IR
placement of tunnelled PICC for initiation of Remodulin.
.
On the floor, initial vital signs were 96.9 122/70 78 16 100%RA.
 Patient was feeling very good.  She reports fatigue, which has
been chronic for her; she has always attributed this to her
liver disease.  No other symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47598**] is a 60 year old lady with a PMH of cryptogenic
cirrhosis c/b porto-pulmonary hypertension with severe pulmonary
hypertension, who presents for placement of a tunnelled PICC and
initiation of Remodulin treatment.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# PULMONARY HYPERTENSION - Patient's only related complaint has
been fatigue.  She suffers from severe pulmonary hypertension
secondary to portopulmonary syndrome which was confirmed on
right heart catheterization with no response to Sildenafil
therapy. The patient was admitted for initiation of Remodulin
therapy via a tunnelled Hickman line, which was placed this
admission. During this admission, she tolerated uptitration of
the medication with only a mild headache and some non-specific
left flank discomfort which resolved without issues. She was
monitored closely after initiation of treatment. Extensive
education regarding Remodulin therapy was performed. She will be
discharged with the Remodulin infusion pump.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS - The patient has a known diagnosis
of primary biliary cirrhosis (stage III by biopsy in [**2163**])
complicated by portal hypertension, grade II esophageal varices,
and portopulmonary syndrome which led to her pulmonary
hypertension (as noted above). She is stable on Nadolol 10 mg PO
daily and Ursodiol 600 mg PO BID. We continued these therapies
without issue.
