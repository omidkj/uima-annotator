History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 14077**] is a 77-year-old man with CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD,
RIMA-RCA, SVG-OM in [**2089**]) and PCI (DES to SVG-OM in [**2106**]),
multiple atrial arrhythmias and tachybrady syndrome s/p multiple
ablations and pacemaker placement in [**2106**], chronic systolic
heart failure, stage IV CRF, recently admitted in [**12/2113**] for CHF
exaceration who presents for CHF management prior to BiV
pacemaker upgrade on [**2114-1-22**].
.
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1565**] [**2114-1-17**] note Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 14077**] has had increasing
cardiac dysfunction primarily due to cardiac dyssynchrony
secondary to chronic ventricular pacing. His ejection fraction
has over the past four years progressively gone from normal to
about 40% with measurements of synchrony being distinctly
abnormal. He has hypokinesis of his septum, which is primarily
related to his pacemaker. He has increasing fluid retention and
inability to get the fluid to his kidneys and perfuse them well.
An attempt to decrease the fluid accumulation and increasing
Lasix has caused the deterioration of his kidney function, such
that his BUN is 101 and creatinine 3.2 with concurrent
hypokalemia and hypochloremia despite the concomitant use of
Aldactone. Decision made to place BiV pacemarker in attempt to
improve cardiac function and secondarily increase his renal
perfusion.
.
On direct presentation from home patient reports ~5lb weight
gain with abd distension since [**1-17**] appt. No changes made to
medications, no dietary or medications non-complinance. Denies
any worsening peripheral edema; stable 2 pillow orthopnea, no
PND, no palpitations.
.
Patient admitted on [**1-20**]; BiV unable to be placed on [**1-22**] due to
technically difficult therefore epicardial leads placed on [**1-23**].
Intra-op recevied received total of 15cc contrast. Patient
underwent procedure successfully. Placed on coumadin and hep
gtt. Patient received a dose of vanco during procedure; keflex
continued x2days post. Post-operative course complicated by
acute renal failure, nephrology consulted deterioration in
function secondary to poor forward flow.
.
Of note on night prior to transfer patient s/p mechanical fall
while walking - denies any preceding dizziness, chest pain,
palpitations.
.
Current cardiac review of systems: denies dizziness, chest
pressure, shortness of breath, stable abdominal distention.
Denies diaphoresis, n/v.
.
On review of systems, reports pain at operative when coughing,he
reports prior history of stroke, GI bleed in the setting of ASA,
plavix; denies bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Studies
TTE: [**1-23**]
1. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage.
2. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. A small mobile echodense mass associated with a pacing
wire is seen in the right atrium near the interatrial septum.
3. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
4. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with dyskinesis of the apical anteroseptal and inferoseptal
walls, and severe hypokinesis of the mid septum. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
5. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline
norm
