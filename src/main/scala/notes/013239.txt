ERCP BILIARY&PANCREAS BY GI UNIT Study Date of [**2134-3-16**] 8:54 PM
Impression:
- Multiple ulcers in the duodenal bulb and second part of the
duodenum with some oozing of blood.
- Normal major papilla.
- Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was performed with a
sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in partial opacification. This was performed
in order to place a pancreatic duct stent to facilitate biliary
cannulation.
- The major papilla was cannulated and a normal caliber distal
pancreatic duct was visualized. The main pancreatic duct was
short and truncated with arborization proximally. The minor
papilla was not cannulated. These findings are consistent with
pancreas divisum.
- A 5FR x 4cm plastic pancreatic duct stent was placed
successfully to facilitate biliary cannulation, and was removed
successfully using a snare prior to the placement of the biliary
stent.
- Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a
sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed and with a PD stent
in place as the cannulation was difficult. Contrast medium was
injected resulting in complete opacification.
- A mild diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD
measuring 7-8 mm. There were no stones or strictures. These
findings are compatible with a normal CBD for his age.
- A 7cm by 10FR biliary stent was placed successfully.
- A small amount of biliary sludge was seen at the ampulla
during cannulation. However, once the biliary stent was placed
clear bile without sludge or pus drained fomr the stent.
- The cystic duct was not visualized during the procedure as it
did not fill with contrast.

Brief Hospital Course:
75M with DM2, CKD, Afib, CHF, presenting with abdominal pain,
N/V, found to be jaundiced with elevated bilirubin and
transaminases with pneumobilia, transferred for ERCP.

# Pneumobilia, Abdominal pain: Patient was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital **] Hospital after presenting to their hospital
with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and found to have a
leukocytosis, elevated bilirubin and transaminases concerning
for biliary tree obstruction.  He was started on Unasyn at
[**Hospital **] Hospital and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for an ERCP.
He underwent ERCP on [**3-16**] that demonstrated oozing duodenal
ulcers, but no evidence of stones. Two biliary stents were
placed and he was started on a PPI [**Hospital1 **]. A serum H. pylori test
was sent that was negative and he was continued on Unasyn 3g
q8H. General Surgery recommended percutaneous biliary drainage
prior to cholecystecomy, but IR did not feel there was an
indication for drainage.  Following ERCP patient remained
hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and both his WBC & LFT's
trended down.  He tolerated a regular diet.  He was discharged
home with follow up in general surgery clinic for possibility of
outpatient cholecystectomy and GI for management of duodenal
ulcers and repeat ERCP to remove stents.  Patient was discharged
home with 8 more days of cipro and flagyl to complete a 10 day
course of antibiotics.

#. Duodenal ulcers - Patient discharged with omeprazole 40 mg
[**Hospital1 **] and has a follow up appointment with GI.  Patient was
recommended to restart his coumadin for management of his atrial
fibrillation despite the finding of oozing duodenal ulcers on
ERCP.  Patient was warned about risks of GI bleeding and
educated as to what to watch out for.  Patient will have a
repeat CBC drawn on [**2134-4-1**] when he sees his PCP to monitor his
blood counts.

# Afib: Patient on Coumadin and Metoprolol as an outpatient. He
was continued on his home Metoprolol during admission, but
coumadin held for ERCP.  Patient will restart coumadin after
discharge, but was instructed to hold on taking coumadin
