Chief Complaint:
anemia

EGD

Capsule study


History of Present Illness:
57 yo F with chronic anemia of unkown etiology, RA and MGUS,
referred to the ED for a Hct of 16. She has had a workup of her
anemia, including normal endoscopy and colonoscopy. A capsule
study was unsuccsesful when the capsule did not pass through her
stomach. She denies any bleeding source, although states that
during the bowel prep, she irritated her external hemorrhoids
with diarrhea (approx 3 episodes/ day for 5 days) and did notice
blood in the bowel, on the toilet paper during the prep. This is
currently resolving.  On Friday [**2-22**], she noticed some
lightheadiness and dyspnea.  On Sunday, [**2-24**], she developed some
chest burning while walking that lasted [**11-10**]' and went away
with sitting down.  She has never had any episodes like this in
the past.

In the ED inital vitals were, 99.5 128 98/55 16 100%, tachy up
to 130s. 2 large bore IVs. Gave her 1 UPRBC and 2 L IVF. CXR
with Right base opacity, given levofloxacin. GI was consulted.
Vitals prior to transfer: HR 100, BP 101/55, RR 16, 99%2L, 98.1
T.

On arrival to the ICU, patient is getting 3rd Unit of PRBCs and
a liter of normal saline.  She is not actively bleeding and is
in no acute distress.  She is speaking in full sentences.
Denies any cough or dyspnea, but does endorse a history of
"pleurisy" in her right lower lobe followd by an outside
pulmonolgist.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain (+ initially with prednisone). Denies headache, sinus
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of
breath, or wheezing. Denies palpitations, or weakness. Denies
nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain. Denies dysuria,

Brief Hospital Course:
57 F with RA, chronic anemia (baseline Hct 27-30) presented to
the ED with a Hct of 17 found on routine labs. She was initially
admitted to the ICU where she underwent a GI workup.  She had an
NSTEMI.  She was transferred to the floor on [**2132-2-28**].
.
ICU Course:
# Anemia - Microcytic with normal iron studies.  Patient had had
a thorough GI workup including endoscopy and colonoscopy [**12-7**]
for evaluation of anemia. Capsule study performed but capsule
did not pass the stomach (not visualized on surveliance x-ray
here). She was guaiac negative on admission (2 times), but had
red blood w/ BM morning following admission.  GI was consulted
and patient underwent bowel prep and upper and lower endoscopy
which demonstrated gastritis but no significant bleeding source.
Additional concerns of poor production given high WBC count and
may suggest heme malignancy (reticulocyte count of 7.9, RI of
1.3).  On admission, patient was transfused 3 units PRBCs with
appropriate response of Hct from 17.7 to 28.1.  Patient was
continued on home omprazole 20mg daily as well as Iron 325mg
daily and Folate 1mg daily (400mcg at home).

# NSTEMI: >1mm ST depression in lateral leads.  She had positive
Troponin with chest pain on [**2132-2-24**]. It was thought to be likely
[**2-28**] demand ischemia due to combination of tachycardia and
anemia.  The ICU team documented that there was no concern for
active ischemia as EKG ST depression resolved with 3 units of
blood however, her cardiologist called it an NSTEMI. Tropoinins
went from 0.11 to 0.18 and peaking at 0.27.  On the night of
admission, she was given 325mg ASA.  An echo done [**2132-2-27**]
demonstrated an EF of 25-30% with regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
She was transitioned to 81mg ASA daily as well as Atorvastatin
80mg qd and Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Outside
lipids from [**2-7**] demonstrated an LDL of 132 and HDL 63.  Patient
was evaluated by Atrius cardiology and recommended follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6512**] and he will decide whether to pursue a nuclear
stress test. Given that her BP was 100s, lisinopril was not
started prior to discharge but the patient was advised to follow
up with her cardiologist as scheduled on [**3-12**] and discuss
restarting it.  She will also discuss getting a stress test as
her ECHO showed a LV systolic dysfunction concerning for an
ischemic etiology.  Her tachycardia resolved after transfusions
and at discharge was in the 90s.
.
# Infiltrate on CXR with increased WBC.  Patient got
levofloxacin in the ED but was not continued on it.  She is on
doxycycline for episcleritis. She did not have a cough or sputum
production.  She has a history of "pleurisy" in right lower
lobe.
.
# RA: has been active: complicated by pleurisy/ pulmonary
fibrosis, episcleritis. She receives outpatient infusions of
methotrexate and actemra. Her diclofenac was held due to
bleeding. Her prednisone was increased to 30 mg po daily in the
ICU. Upon discharge, she will complete a short taper back to 10
mg po daily.
.
# Episcleritis - the patient continued on her regiment of eye
dropps.
.
# COPD - Pt was on symbicort as outpatient. While in house, she
was given Advair but will resume symbicort at home.
.
# Tachycardia: The patient has a history of tachycardia and was
on metoprolol.  IN the acute setting, her tachycardia was
thought to be secondary to anemia, hypovolemia.  It improved
with fluids and PRBCS.  She was restarted on her BB.
.
# Hypertension: Not active - Lisinopril was held due to concern
for bleeding and SBPs in the 100s.
.
# Question Sleep apnea:  Patient was noted to be snoring with
desaturations to the mid 80s while on continuous O2 monitoring.
She would recover her saturations promptly without any
intervention but likely needs to follow up with an outpatient
sleep study with consideration of CPAP.
