Imaging:
CXR: [**2148-8-9**]: stable enlarged pulmonary vasculature. unable to
visualize left costophrenic angle due to technique. mild
blunting of right costophrenic angle. Overall no significant
change from prior [**2148-8-7**].
.
CTA [**2148-8-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormalities.
2. Overall, improvement in multifocal pneumonia. Decreased
consolidation at
the bases, but new foci in the right middle lobe. Interval
decrease in size
of hilar lymphadenopathy.
.
.
ECHO [**2146**]: LVH, LVEF>55%, 1+ MR, 1+ AR, 2+ TR, mod pulm htn, and
grade II diastolic dysfunction
.
ECG [**2148-8-9**]: rate 102, sinus, left axis deviation, LVH and RVH,
markedly biphasic p-waves in V1-V3, suggesting left atrial
enlargement, upsloaping ST/T segments V2-V4 similar morphology
to prior, but with ST elevation 1mm, may represent early repol.

.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 41 yo F with PMH of IDDM, HTN, asthma who presents new
onset *24 SOB in the setting of right-sided chest pain.
.
# SOB: Broad differential: Pt. was admitted to CCU for fear of
PE, given history and [**Doctor Last Name **] of 6. CTA showed no evidence of
pulmonary embolism. Patient was started emperically on heparin
until CTA returned negative for PE, then it was stopped. MI was
ruled out w/ three sets of negative enzymes (TropT < 0.02 x3).
Also concerned with lateral ST elevations although upsloping,
reassuring as similar in shape to prior, Also possible that this
represents the begining of shingles outbreak or dermatomal pain
from disc disease given patient's skin sensitivity and
dermatomal distribution of pain.  Patient has hx of R-sided
zoster in the past, though she said it felt nothing like this.
BNP was 420, unlikely CHF. Wegner's unlikely given no protein in
urine. Patient with no new fevers, chills, cough improving to
suggest worsening of infection.  The pain decreased and she was
transfered to a medicine floor where her pain was easily
controlled w/ ibuprofen and she was weaned off oxygen.  Pt. was
set up for sleep study w/ respiratory but did not tolerate CPAP.
.
# Leukocytosis with normal diff: may be stress response to
solumedrol depending on when labs were drawn, no left shift, no
new fevers.  U/A shows no bacteria, glucose in blood, no
ketones. WBC 8.1 on day of d/c.

.
#Tachycardia: Pt had sinus tachycardia to the 120s that was
unresponsive to fluid boluses (500 ml NS x2). BPs stable and in
the 140s/70s. Pt has been documented w/ tachycardias ranging
from 90 - 120 HR as an outpatient since [**2140**]. Denies CP or
palpitations. Given obesity, CAD risk factors, and prolonged
inactivity, likely patient is deconditioned. She was monitored
on telemetry o/n and was asymptomatic.
.
# DM: restarted lantus and HISS as patient presented with high
blood glucose in the setting of taking none of her home
medications.
.
# Asthma: Did not appear to be significantly contributing to
SOB, was kept on home meds
.
# HTN: cont HCTZ, bp poorly controlled on admission
SBPs140-180s. Given patient is a diabetic would benefit from
ACEi, she was started on 5mg lisinopril and her SBPs came down
to the 120s on day of D/C.

.
# Diastolic CHF: Echo [**7-5**] EF>60%: She had no pleural effusions
or leg swelling to suggest this was causing her SOB.  BNP was
<500

.
# ? Sleep apnea: Pt. did not tolerate autoset CPAP.
