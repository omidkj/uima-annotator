Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken emergently to the OR for laparotomy and Hartmann
procedure on [**2140-12-25**] for perforated diverticulitis. Surgeon was
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. He was hemodynamically unstable in the OR
requiring neosynephrine and levophed. He was given FFP and
developed a rash. He was transferred intubated to the SICU
postop. Bedside TTE demonstrated heavily calcified aortic valve,
mild global hypokinesis with paradoxical septal motion of LBBB.
He was AV paced at 50bpm. Cardiology adjusted his heart rate to
DDDR with resting rate of 75bpm. Overall picture was one of
sepsis. Cipro and Flagyl were given. He was preload dependent
and was treated with IV fluids.

On [**12-27**], sedation was weaned, but he failed spontaneous
breathing trial and desaturated. Bronch was performed for mucus
plugging. BAL was sent and was negative. Pressor requirements
decreased. Echo noted enlarged RV with free wall hypokinesis,
4+TR, moderate pulmonary HTN, akinesis inf/lat wall. EF was
35-40%. Creatinine started to decrease with improved urine
output. He was weaned off pressors.

On [**12-27**], INR had increased to 4.0. FFP and vitamin K were
given. INR decreased to 1.7. Sedation was decreased and he self
extubated on [**12-28**] as well as pulled out the JP drain. He
remained stable post extubation. Mitts were applied. The
peritoneal fluid from intra op isolated GNR /bacteroides
fragilis in the broth only.

Incision appeared red and Vancomycin was started on [**12-25**].
Vancomycin was stopped on [**1-5**]. The ostomy was working. A post
pyloric feeding tube was placed and feedings were started.
Bedside swallow eval was done noting edentulous state and some
confusion. He did not aspirate therefore, recommendations
included ground solids and thin liquids which he started.

Urine output increased and creatinine continued to improve. CXR
demonstrated volume overload and Lasix was given.  The incision
was opened for increased redness and a wound VAC applied. He was
transferred out of the SICU on [**1-1**].

On [**1-3**], he was less confused. Wrist restraints were removed.
Diet was advanced as ostomy output was occurring.

On [**1-4**], he vomited. An abdominal CT was done showing no focal
fluid collection or free air to indicate new perforation, no
obstruction. Ascites and nodular hepatic contour were seen,
raising question of cirrhosis, unchanged. Diverticulosis was
noted. There were increased moderate bilateral pleural effusions
with more confluent appearance of right lower lobe
consolidation, raising question of aspiration versus
infection. Vomiting resolved. Levaquin was started for pneumonia
on [**1-5**]. A congested cough was present. O2 sats were 93% on room
air.

Coumadin was resumed on [**1-3**] at 1mg per day. INR was 2.0 on
[**1-5**]. On day of discharge, OSH micro [**Month/Day (2) **] fax'd blood cultures
from [**12-24**] that were positive for Fusobacterium nucleatum in the
anaerobic bottle only. Flagyl was resumed (had stopped on [**1-4**]
after 10 days). The plan to complete a 14 day course. Blood
cultures were negative on [**12-25**] and blood cultures from [**1-4**]
were negative to date.

PT evaluated and recommended rehab (refer to note). A bed was
available at [**Hospital1 **], [**Location (un) 1110**] and he was transferred there for
rehab.
