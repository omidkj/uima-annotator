Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with h/o HTN, CAD s/p CABG 6
yrs ago, PPM, recent thrombosed popliteal artery on coumadin p/w
chest pain and GIB with 10 point hematocrit drop. He was also
having transient chest pain in the ER which resolved with a SL
nitro. Patient is a resident at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and was found to
have HCT 20 on routine labs, sent to ER at [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation. It seems his main complaint at rehab was chest pain,
patient had not noticed any blood in stool, hematuria or
hematemesis and staff was called regarding GI bleed questions
and other than dark stools there was no note of additional overt
GI bleed symptoms per staff.

In the ED, Mr. [**Known lastname 311**] had guiaic + stool, 2 18g PIV placed and
IVFs started, 40mg IV protonix given and ECG showed V paced rate
[**Street Address(2) 28176**] elevations or TWIs and was unchanged from prior
EKG. In ED vitals were HR 50, BP 150/38, RR18 and he was 100%
oxygen saturation on 2L NC.
.
On further ROS, the patient had some mild chest "discomfort" and
has chronic lower back pain. Mr [**Known lastname 311**] also has a history of
colonic polyps diagnosed at OH in the past. An NG lavage was not
placed due to patient intolerance and lack of cooperation in ED.
He rceived 2 Units of PRBC on night of admission and then
another 2 Units on [**2110-7-30**] and his Hct has increased from 19.6 to
23.0, then to 26.7. Mr. [**Known lastname 7695**] BUN/Cr ratio was also elevated,
although not markedly from his baseline which appears to be
2.2/2.3 range. His troponins were very mildly elevated and
considered a r/o for ACS times 2 during additional workup to
f/up CP complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary the patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with h/o HTN, CAD
s/p CABG 6 yrs ago, PPM, recent thrombosed popliteal artery on
coumadin p/w chest pain and GIB awaiting EGD today ([**7-31**])

During his ICU stay the following plans were carried out:

1) GI Bleed :

The DDx includes PUD, [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear, malignancy, Dieulafoy
lesion. Could also be LGIB but less likely given melena. GI
following and plans to scope today, [**7-31**],  in EGD suite prior to
transfer to floor.  Patient still has no abdominal pain so less
concerning for acute mesenteric ischemia, colonic ischemia still
possibility.
He has a known history of hyperplastic polyps which is also
pertinent.
He was con't on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] and pt was transfused 4 units of
pRBCs for goal of Hct>25. EGD was completed on [**2110-7-31**] which
showed friability and erythema in stomach body and antrum,
erythema in duodenum, erosions in the duodenal bulb, and medium
hiatal hernia. There were no active bleeding ulcers. Biopsies
were taken from the stomach mucosa for evaluation of H. pylori.

GI ok'd restarting ASA 81 and coumadin. Pt was on
anticoagulation for popliteal artery thrombosis that was dx'd in
[**2110-6-24**]. His INR goal is [**1-26**]. Pt's [**Month/Day (3) 1106**] surgeon is Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3407**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1237**]. We attempted to contact his office
to find out the time course for his anticoagulation however he
was out of office today ([**2110-7-31**]). Pt does have follow-up appt
with him later this month. Coumadin was restarted on [**2110-8-2**] and
he is on lovenox which can be stopped when the INR is >2.0.

2)CAD/chest pain:

Patient remained on telemetry during ICU stay. ASA was held
while awaiting EGD and given GI bleeding. Cardiac enzymes were
barely elevated and ACS r/o, team is no longer trending cardiac
enzymes as patient has no active SOB,CP or palpitations. He has
had no further episodes of CP.
Continued isosorbide DN and lipitor. Beta blocker was re-started
at half of pt's home dose after EGD. Will con't SL nitro prn for
any CP.

3) Anemia ?????? likely chronic component from CKD history mixed with
acute Hct drop from recent GI bleed source. Patient given 4
Units PRBCs total since admitted.

4) CKD:

Baseline Cr 2.3. Given elevated BUN he has a probable pre-renal
component from GIB and dehydration.  ICU team repleted with PRBC
and IVFs, light hydration with boluses PRN post EGD. Avoiding
nephrotoxic medications.
Based on calculated TTKG of 4.5 and Urine Anion Gap of 32
calculated from [**7-31**] labs to further investigate patient's non-AG
metabolic acidosis his renal picture appears to fit a type 4 RTA
given hyperkalemic tendency alongside these findings. He may
have some impaired distal renal acidification and may not be
excreting ammonium well. Hypoaldosteronism is possibility given
TTKG less than 7. Lasix was held until [**8-2**] and has been given
with resolution of hypoxia and diminished edema.  Would continue
lasix 20 mg daily with frequent monitoring of electrolytes.

5) HTN:

Metoprolol was restarted at half home dose after EGD.

6) Popliteal artery thrombosis:

Coumadin held initially. Patient has warm extremties and 2+
pedal pulses bilaterally, but still has mild right knee pain
with flexion motions noted on exam. RLE LENI was negative.

7) Lung nodules

Seen on prior xrays, not a new phenomenon, bu
