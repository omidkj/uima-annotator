CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2194-8-26**] 9:59 AM

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST; CT RECONSTRUCTION

Reason: 72 male s/p fall down 20 stairs

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
72 male s/p fall down 20 stairs
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATIONS: Fall down 20 stairs.

TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast cervical spine CT.

COMPARISON: None.

NOTE: This study was initially performed on [**2194-8-26**].
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9768**] at the time this
study was performed, but the study was not dictated until the
morning of [**2194-8-27**], due to PACS malfunction.

NONCONTRAST CERVICAL SPINE CT: There are minimally displaced and
comminuted fractures through the left C7 and T1 transverse
processes. The margins do not appear to extend into the foramina
transversaria. Positioning limits assessment of alignment due to
extreme head tilting to the right, but this is likely the best
obtainable secondary to intubation and nasogastric tube
placement. Allowing for the limitations, the vertebral bodies
are normal in height and normally aligned. There is no
atlantoaxial subluxation. The lateral masses of C1 articulate
normally about the odontoid process. Prevertebral soft tissue
swelling cannot be excluded secondary to intubation. Extensive
carotid arterial calcifications are present in the bulb regions
bilaterally. Biapical lung scarring and mild bronchiectasis are
present.

Also noted is sclerosis and opacification of the visualized left
mastoid air cells and mastoid tip, likely chronic inflammatory
disease.

IMPRESSION: Minimally displaced, comminuted fractures of the
left C7 and T1 transverse processes. No evidence of extension
into the foramina transversaria.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2194-8-26**] 9:42 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: bleed?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man with intraparenchymal bleed s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
bleed?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage after fall. Assess for
hemorrhage.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

COMPARISON: No prior studies are available. By report, the
patient has an outside study. Should this become available, an
addendum will be issued to this report following the comparison
with the outside examination.

NOTE: This study was initially performed on the morning of
[**8-26**], and is being dictated on the morning of [**8-27**]
due to PACS malfunction. Findings were called to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9768**]
on the morning of [**8-26**].

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a small amount of hemorrhage
within the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, right
greater than left. Located within the atrium of the right
lateral ventricle is an 18 x 10 mm nodular area of increased
density which is separate from the choroid plexus. There is no
evidence of surrounding edema. There is diffuse brain atrophy
and chronic microvascular infarction throughout the white
matter. There is a remote right frontal infarct. There is no
evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or acute major vascular
territorial infarction. The ventricles do not appear dilated
relative to the sulci, and there is no shift of normally midline
structures. There is no skull fracture. There is opacification
of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx but an NG tube is
present, and the patient is intubated. Opacified and sclerotic
left mastoid air cells are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. Ovoid 18-mm density within the atrium of the right lateral
ventricle. This could represent either an atypically located
blood clot or an intraventricular mass, and further evaluation
with contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain, when clinically
feasible, is recommended.

Results were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9768**] in the early
afternoon on [**2194-8-26**].

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2194-9-19**] 12:34 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: altered mental status

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
altered mental status
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 72-year-old male with altered mental status.

TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast CT scans of the brain were
obtained.

Comparison is made to a previous study from [**2194-9-1**].

FINDINGS:

There are numerous areas of decreased attenuation in the
periventricular and subcortical white matter of both cerebral
hemispheres, indicating chronic microvascular infarction. There
is also an old right frontal lobe cortical infarction. A small
right occipital lobe chronic infarction is also evident. There
is a small amount of blood layering in both lateral ventricles,
and this has decreased since the previous study. The size and
shape of the ventricles is unchanged. No new hemorrhage is
observed.

There is opacification of the mastoid air cells, greater on the
left than the right. There is some fluid or mucosal thickening
in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.

IMPRESSION: No new cortical territorial infarction or hemorrhage
is identified. There is decreased intraventricular blood,
compared to the previous study, and there are no signs of
hydrocephalus.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2194-9-17**] 9:10 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Fever, f/u infiltrte

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72yo M with rib fx s/p trauma, failure on previous CXR, now with
fever.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Fever, f/u infiltrte
HISTORY: Trauma, congestive heart failure, fever, pneumonia.

Portable supine chest radiograph shows improvement in edema
compared to studies from four and five days earlier with no
significant radiographic change in right upper lobe
consolidation consistent with pneumonia. Some interstitial edema
still persists, but there is no central pulmonary vascular
congestion. Cardiac size is unchanged. The amount of fluid
layering at the apices and the pleural spaces appear slightly
decreased. Multiple left-sided rib fractures are seen.
Supporting tubes and lines are in unchanged position and the
patient has a single lead pacemaker projected on the left.
Calcification is seen at both carotid bifurcations.

CONCLUSION: Improvement in congestion from edema with no
worsening, but no significant improvement, in the right upper
lobe pneumonia. Supporting lines and tubes in unchanged
position.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to TSICU for subarachnoid hemorrhage and multiple
spinal fractures.  Intubated and sedated for desats on [**2194-9-1**].
 Evaluated by neurosurgery and deemed stable on [**2194-8-27**].  CT
head remained stable for SAH.  Eva
