Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breat

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This 34 year old male presents for hypertension and shortness of
breath.

He has a history of type 1 DM since age 19 complicated by
nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and gastroparesis. He has
end-stage renal disease with right arm fistula for access, on a
Tuesday, Thurs, Saturday schedule for dialysis.

He presents for shortness of breath worsening over the past day.
One day prior to admission he got dialyzed and had a dry weight
of 72.1 (his usual post-dialysis weight is 73). However,
following dialysis, he drank more fluids than usual, and then
became progressively short of breath.

He also has had nausea and abdominal pain, consistent with his
gastroparesis.

In the ED, he was noted to have a blood pressure of 200 systolic
and was started on nitroglycerin drip. He was started on BiPAP
initially for his shortness of breath, however he was not able
to tolerate this, and he was quickly weaned to a non-rebreather,
saturating at 100%. A chest x-ray revealed significant volume
overload.
He was admitted to the ICU for his hypertension and volume
overload. At time of transfer, he was weaned to 6 L NC and was
saturating near 100% with improvement in respiratory rate. He
continued to endorse significant nausea and abdominal pain. He
received Zofran and Reglan in the ED, but had persistent
symptoms. Review of systems otherwise negative.

Moderate pulmonary edema with stable cardiomegaly

[**2147-5-14**]   Cardiovascular ECG
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left ventricular
hypertrophy by
voltage criteria with lateral ST-T wave changes which may be due
to left
ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia. [**Year/Month/Day **] correlation is
suggested.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2147-2-28**] the lateral ST-T

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21822**] is a 34 year old man with significant PMH of Type I
DM c/b retinopathy, neuropathy, gastroparesis, ESRD, and
ischemic cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the MICU on [**5-14**] for
worsening shortness of breath found to have hypertensive
emergency with flash pulmonary edema.

# Hypertensive crisis: Presented with SBP>200, triggering flash
pulmonary edema. Etiology thought to be due to dietary
indiscretion with possible medication dosing missed due to
nausea and vomiting. Responded well to nitroglycerin drip on
night of admission to MICU. By morning after admission, patient
was off nitroglycerin drip and back on home antihypertensives
including labetolol TID 600mg/600mg/300mg, amlodipine 10mg,
lisinopril 40mg, and [**Month/Day (4) 40899**] 0.3mg patch qweekly. His blood
pressure remained well controlled over the next 24 hours.

# Pulmonary edema: Precipitated by hypertensive crisis. He
responded quickly to correction of his hypertension with
nitroglycerin gtt overnight (see above). On admission to
medicine floor he was saturating well on 2L NC and by morning of
admission was ambulating floor on RA without complaint and clear
lung exam. Patient received hemodialysis prior to discharge.

# End-stage renal disease: Patient received HD on [**2147-5-16**] and was
followed by the Nephrology consult service. He will resume his
usual schedule of HD on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday after
discharge.

CHRONIC PROBLEMS
# Abdominal Pain, nausea and vomiting.  Consistent with history
of gastroparesis.
Was NPO and received IV dilaudid while in MICU. Was transitioned
to home dosing of oral dilaudid for pain with oral zofran
following transfer to medicine floor.

# Type 1 DM - with nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy;
also has ischemic cardiomyopathy. History of very labile blood
sugars. Blood sugars moderately elevated in ICU with gap,
although improved with closing gap following SC insulin morning
after admission.  Continued glargine 14 units with HISS.

# Ischemic cardiomyopathy - In setting of type I DM. LVEF in
[**Month (only) 956**] 40%, although improved to >55% in repeat exam later
that month.  Patient was continued on his lisinopril and
aspirin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Would continue to stress importance of dietary and medication
compliance.
- Close monitoring of HTN as outpatient.
