HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the OR for an
exploratory laparotomy.  The patient had an exploratory
laparotomy with a liver laceration repair and thyrocervical
trunk injury that was coiled.  The patient also had an IVC
filter placed on [**2139-10-6**] in order to discontinue Coumadin
for her history of DVT and PE.

The patient was sent to the Trauma SICU intubated.  Studies
done while the patient was in the Trauma SICU revealed a head
CT with a small subarachnoid hemorrhage and bilateral
subdural hemorrhages.  A CT of the C-spine revealed widened
space between C4-5.  A right knee x-ray was negative.  An MRI
showed no infarct.  An MRA of the C-spine showing right side
paracentral disk protrusion at C4-5.  A CT of the TLS showing
a right lamina fracture at T4 and an L1 transverse process
fracture.  The patient had a repeat head CT on [**2139-10-6**]
showing an improved subarachnoid hemorrhage and a subdural
hemorrhage unchanged.  A CT of the chest showed no PE and no
great vessel injury, and a right sternoclavicular joint
dislocation and a rib fracture on the left side at rib 7 and
on the right side ribs [**3-26**].  The CT of the pelvis was
negative for fracture.

While in the Trauma SICU, the patient began to spike
temperatures to a temperature of 101 but workup was negative
except for a sputum culture which grew out coagulase-positive
Staphylococcus.  The patient completed a seven day course of
vancomycin and a ten day course of levofloxacin.  The patient

yeast.  She completed a seven day course of fluconazole as

respiratory distress.  The patient was transferred to the
floor on postoperative day number 18.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable and had aggressive chest PT and
remained without respiratory distress.  The patient remained
afebrile throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
The patient remained in the TLSO brace and the C collar for
her fractures.

On [**2139-10-28**], the patient pulled her NG tube out and had a
swallowing study performed which she passed and a video
