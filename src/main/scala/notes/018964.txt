Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure following seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, extubation
Bronchoscopy with resection of lung mass
Bronchoalveolar lavage


History of Present Illness:
64 year old male with COPD, CAD s/p CABG, AICD, and unexplained
spells of unresponsiveness (? hypoxia, vs arrythmia, vs seizure)
who presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on the 16th with dyspnea. The
patient apparently drove to [**Hospital1 1562**] himself and presented to
the ED where he complained of shortness of breath. He became
responsive shortly thereafter without dropping his sats and was
intubated electively for airway protection. He then was noted to
have a tonic-clonic seizure. He was admitted to the MICU with
neurology following and cardiology. EEG was pending. He remained
stable and today was bronched with the plan to help with
pulmonary toilet prior to extubation. During this procedure
patient found to have left lower lobe obstructing, friable mass.
Therefore, after discussion with the IP service here the patient
was transferred here for definitive management. Of note, prior
to decision to tx patient for bronch the patient had been
allowed to wake up and was communicating appropriately off
sedation.
At arrival the patient was intubated and sedated. ROS
unobtainable. Bronchoscopy here revealed similar tumor in left
lower bronchus.

Imaging:
[**2122-9-1**]: Echo
Poor image quality. The left atrium is elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is probably mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
.
CXR [**9-6**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the image is
again
technically limited. Moderate cardiomegaly, no signs of overt
pulmonary
edema. Unchanged retrocardiac and right basal atelectasis. The
presence of
small-to-moderate pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
Unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly. Unchanged left pectoral pacemaker.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old male w/ severe COPD, seizure disorder?, CAD,
presenting with respiratory distress and with unresponsive spell
then found to have new left lower carina mass.
.
1) Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was initially
intubated for airway protection in the setting of apnea due to a
likely neurological event.  Nevertheless, upon his arrival he
required significant respiratory support with high FiO2's and
pressures.  Given patient had a fever early in the day was
initially treated for presumed pneumonia with
cefepime/vancomycin and given bronchodilators for COPD.  He also
required a signficant amount of IVF on the night of admission
due to hypotension so then developed an exacerbation of his
chronic systolic CHF.  He was diuresed successfully with doses
of IV furosemide and extubated on [**2122-9-4**].  Following some
respiratory distress on the night of [**9-4**] he was restarted on
oral prednisone with plan for a five day burst.  At time of
transfer from unit on [**9-6**] he was satting well on 3L O2 by
nasal cannula. On the floor, pt was weaned down to 3L O2 with
goal O2 sats 88-92% given underlying COPD. Pt was breathing with
minimal laboring, on exam had crackles and wheezing, crackles
resolved after lasix challenge. Respiratory came to assess pt
for CPAP but pt refused this. Pt's respiratory status was
combination of obstruction by mass, post-obstructive PNA, COPD
exacerbation with slight element of CHF. He completed 7-day
course of vanco, will copmlete 7-day course of levofloxacin
(last day [**9-11**]) and 5-day course of prednisone (last day
[**9-9**]). Nebulizer treatments, inhaled steroids, and inhaled
albuterol should be continued at rehab.
.
2) Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient known to have
depressed EF but received multiple fluid boluses on night of
presentation in the setting of hypotension.  He then developed
chest radiograph findings consistent with volume overload and
presumed exacerbation of his chronic systolic CHF.  He diuresed
well with 60 mg doses of IV furosemide and was eventually
negative for length of stay.  Echo showed improved EF from
previous reports (EF of 45%) with no obvious wall motion
abnormalities. Pt was hypervolemic on exam with rales and lower
ext edema, given lasix daily (from 80mg IV to 160mg PO) with net
negative output of 1L/day. Pt's exam prior to discharge was
euvolemic and lasix was put back to home dose of 30mg [**Hospital1 **]. All
other home medications were continued.
.
3) Post-obstructive Pneumonia: The patient had a CT scan of his
chest on [**2122-8-29**] at presentation to the outside hospital
which revealed no infiltrate.  On the day of transfer, however,
he had a fever a
