Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and dyspnea

[**2106-2-17**] 1. Drainage of Pericardial Effusion. 2. Right atrial
exploration. 3. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 4. Pulmonary
artery exploration.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 41 year old female with recurrent pericardial effusion
& tamponade of unknown etiology presents with acute onset chest
pain and dyspnea. EMS noted her to be hypertensive to 250/109
and in CHF by exam. In ED, EKG & enzymes were (-) for ischemia,
and she was diuresed with symptomatic improvement prior to
admission to the floor with SaO2 97% on 4L O2. Chest CTA
contraindicated due to severe dye reaction and she was started
empirically on a heparin gtt in ED but d/c'd this am. Patient
has a previous history of recurrent PE despite IVC filter and
describes her presentation as similar to these prior episodes.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for the same symptoms and a
chronic pericardial effusion, present since [**2105-1-14**] but not
hemodynamically significant until an echo performed on [**2-3**]
demonstrated tamponade physiology. She underwent a
pericardiocentesis on [**2-3**] and ~400cc of sterile transudative
fluid was drained with significant improvement of her symptoms.
She was subsequently discharged on [**2-7**]. Her orthopnea resumed
within 36hrs post discharge and progressed until her
presentation last night which was precipitated by the acute,
non-radiating chest pain.

Social History:
She is married and lives with her husband [**Name (NI) 6409**]. She is
on disability due to her diabetes. She previously worked as a
pharmacist. She denies any tobacco use or EtOH use ever. She
does not have any children but did have one spontaneous
miscarriage at 2 months in [**2097**].


Family History:
Father has a history of MI, is s/p 4V CABG, and has a pacer. Her
mother died at age 56 of cardiac arrest. She also had DM and was
on dialysis. Her mother's dialysis line was "blocked" and during
the attempt to clear the blockage, she arrested and died. She
has one sister who is in good health. A paternal uncle had a
blood clot to his heart and died. She has one cousin who died of
a stroke at age 47. She does not know any medical history about
her grandparents on either side.

Pertinent Results:
[**2106-2-17**] Intraop TEE Pre-CPB:
Before the pericardium was opened: The RV is full and failing
with global severe hypokinesis. There is a small pericardial
effusion, measuring less than 1 cm. There is no collapse of the
RV or RA. The LV is underfilled. There is clot on the end of the
CVP catheter. There is a question of clot in the right atrium
with extension into the left atrium. There are periods of
obvious open cardiac massage with good ejection of blood from an
otherwise near-asystolic heart.

[**2106-2-17**] Intraop TEE Post-CPB:
The patient is on low dose Epi which was quickly weaned, and low
dose Milrinone and is in SR. There is good biventricular
systolic fxn. No MR, no TR, no AI. Aorta intact.

[**2106-2-17**] LENIS:
1. No evidence of DVT within the lower extremity vessels.

[**2106-2-18**] Head CT Scan:
1. Limited study secondary to motion artifact. Questionable area
of hypodensity within the left centrum semiovale. 2. Focal
hypodensity in the region of the right choroidal fissure,
unchanged from the most recent prior study. Differential
diagnosis includes a choroidal fissure cyst versus a prominent
perivascular space.

[**2106-2-19**] Head CT Scan:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema. 2.
Improved paranasal sinus opacification.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted under cardiology with
recurrent pericardial effusion. Given signs of early cardiac
tamponade by echocardiogram, cardiac surgery was urgently
consulted for pericardial window, and she was urgently brought
to the operating room. Upon induction of anesthesia, the patient
became hypotensive and had a cardiac arrest. The patient was
therefore resuscitated. CPR was initiated with compressions to
the sternum but the sternum was quickly opened and internal
cardiac massage was performed. The patient was systemically
anticoagulated and placed on partial cardiopulmonary bypass.
For further surgical details, please see dictated operative
note. Following the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. On postoperative day one, she was initially
unresponsive with flaccid extremities. The stroke service was
consulted and head CT scan was performed which showed no acute
pathology - see result section for details. Over the next 24
hours, her neurological exam greatly improved. Repeat head CT
scan was negative for acute infarct. Given continued clinical
neurological improvements, she was extubated without incident on
postoperative day two. Her CVICU course was otherwise uneventful
and she transferred to the SDU on postoperative day four.
Warfarin anticoagulation was resumed for hypercoaguable state.
Blood pressure was well controlled on Lopressor and Norvasc. She
did require Dilaudid for adequate pain control. She had sternal
drainage which had improved but was started on Ciprofloxacin for
a open groin incision, whcih was healing well at the time of
discharge.  On post operative day # 12 she had a therapuetic INR
on coumadin and was to be continue with lifetime anticoagulation
for history of deep vein thrombosis.  Her lantus was titrated
down with low blood sugars.  She had adequate pain control and
was felt safe to transfer to rehab at this time.
