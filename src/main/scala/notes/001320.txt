History of Present Illness:
80 yo man with CAD and carotid disease s/p stents, sCHF EF 45%
in [**1-17**], hypothyroidism presents for evaluation after having his
metoprolol dose increased. He was in his usual state of health
until 3 days PTA when he had an episode of full body shaking and
rapid breathing. The next day he went to his PCP who increased
his metoprolol dose and told him that it would be fine to take
the increased dose until his appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] on [**3-2**].
However, because pt was anxious about increased dose of
metoprolol, he came to ED.
.
In triage, BP was in systolic 90s, which was attributed to the
recent BBKer increase. He then dropped his BP to systolic 60s,
no symptoms except darkening in his vision, unclear etiology,
and was given 1 liter IVF. He responded appropriately with
repeat BP 90/46 and HR in 70s. ECG was V-paced and without
changes. CXR in ER showed mild interval increase in bibasilar
effusions with persistent findings of mild congestive heart
failure. Patient was discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] and who
recommended reducing metoprolol tartrate to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. The
patient was about to be admitted to the general medicine floor,
when his BP dropped again to systolic 80s. He was instead
admitted to the MICU for further investigation and management.
.
On arrival to the unit, the patient appeared comfortable. He had
no complaints. While in the unit, he received more fluid and his
bp remained stable (85-150)/(51-81). He was asymptomatic.
Infectious w/u was neg and he was transfered to the floor.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34083**] is a 80 yo male with HTN, HL, SSS, hypothyroidism,
CAD s/p MI, here s/p rigors two days ago and transient
hypotension that responded to IVFs in the ED.
.
#.Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension in setting
of recently doubling metoprolol dose, so this is likely
secondary to medication effect. His blood pressure was fluid
responsive. He reported subjective rigors 2 days prior to
presentation, but has no documented fevers, and no leukocytosis
or localizing symptoms to suggest infectious etiology. His
urinalysis was clear. CXR showed no focal consolidations
suggestive of PNA. Given the patient's level of anxiety, there
may be a strong psychiatric component to this hypertension that
led to an increase in his metoprolol dosage two days ago. All
antihypertensives and diuretics were held during ICU stay and
patient's BP stabilized. The patient had received 1 L normal
saline in the ED, and further boluses were held given his
history of CHF.  His metoprolol was re-started at 12.5 mg po bid
w/ normalization of blood pressured prior to discharge.
.
#.CAD/CHF: The patient has an EF of 45% from an ECHO in [**1-/2118**],
secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. CXR on [**2-28**] showed
evidence of chronic mild CHF, and BNP was mildly elevated. ASA
and statin were continued, beta blocker and lasix were held
initially due to hypotension.  Lasix was decreased from 20 mg po
qam and 10 mg po qafternoon to just the am dose.
.
#.Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine was continued at home dose. TSH
was checked to rule out hypothyroidism as cause of hypotension,
and was normal at 3.1.
.
#.Chronic renal insufficiency. Cr ranged 1.2-1.6 during his last
admission in [**2118-1-9**], and was stable at 1.2. Medications were
renally dosed.
.
#. PAF: The pt has a h/o PAF but was in sinus rhythm during this
admission. No anticoagulation given his fall risk.  Metoprolol
12.5 mg po bid re-started prior to discharge.
.
#. Dispo:  We recommended that he have a VNA for
