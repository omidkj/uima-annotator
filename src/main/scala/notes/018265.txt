History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5239**] is an 80 y/o W w/ h/o asthma and HTN who p/w severe
swelling of tongue, lips, and throat. This began on the morning
of admission; she first noticed that she could not speak. Her
swelling progressed rapidly, so she went to her sister-in-law's
house and had her drive her to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]. She denies that she
had trouble breathing during this episode. Of note, she has had
a similar experience twice before, once 4 years ago and once 5
years ago. Neither episode was as severe. She has not been able
to identify any trigger (no new foods, no insect or plant
exposure, etc) other than lisinopril, which she has been taking
for 5-6 years.
.
At [**Location (un) 620**], the patient was treated with epinephrine, Benadryl
50 IV, SoluMedrol 125 mg IV, pepcid 20 mg IV, racemic epi, and a
500 cc NS bolus. ENT evaluated her for a possible surgical
airway; laryngoscopy was consistent with angioedema. ENT
recommended observation, d/c'ing lisinopril permanently, and
decadron 12 mg Q8H. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
observation.
.
In the ED, she received 2 albuterol nebs and was admitted to
MICU for close observation. There, she was treated overnight
with Decadron 12 q8h, Benadryl 25 once, and Nebs q6h. She had
improved markedly from admission; she now says she is almost
back to normal, though with a little residual swelling. She is
called out to the floor for further management.
.
ROS: She is otherwise in good health. She denies dyspnea
currently, chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, dysphagia,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dysuria. She does report
"coughing twice today."

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5239**] is a pleasant 80 year old woman with a history of
hypertension, treated in part with lisinopril, and asthma who
presented with signs and symptoms of angioedema. Her brief
hospital course by problem is as follows:
.
1. Angioedema.
This was attributed to her lisinopril. She was initially
admitted to the MICU for observation, but she never required
airway support and after a day of high-dose steroids she had
improved dramatically. Her care was continued on the floor,
where a taper of her steroids was begun. She was also treated
with famotidine and diphenhydramine. On discharge, she was given
a prescription for a 7-day steroid taper and was instructed to
follow up with an allergist, whose name and number were
provided, as well as her PCP. *** Her PCP may wish to have her
obtain a MedicAlert bracelet. ***
.
2. Asthma.
She had a flare of her asthma on the planned day of discharge,
which necessitated an additional night in the hospital. This
improved with standing albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers q6h
as she uses at home and an inhaled steroid similar to her
outpatient budesonide. At the time of discharge, she was
breathing comfortably and reported that she was at her baseline.

.
3. Hypertension.
She was started on Nifedipine to control her blood pressure,
which had good effect. She was given a prescription for
Nifedipine XL and was instructed not to use ACE inhibitors in
the future.
.
4. Leukocytosis.
She had a brief increase in her WBC count of one day's duration.
She had no signs of infection, and it was believed that this was
due to steroids. It resolved as the steroids were tapered.
.
5. Anemia.
She was at her baseline hematocrit, although the etiology of
this is as yet unknown. She had no evidence of iron, B12, or
folate deficiency, and her stool was negative for occult blood.
.
6. Chronic renal failure.
She has had an elevated creatinine over the last several months,
with a baseline of 1.2 to 1.4. She remained in this range
throughout her hospitalization, although actually improved to
0.9 on discharge. Further evaluation was deferred.
.
7. Prophylaxis: She was given a bowel regimen PRN, pneumoboots
to prevent DVTs, and an insulin sliding scale while she was on
high-dose steroids.
.
8. Code Status: FULL
.
9. Dispo: She was discharged to home.
