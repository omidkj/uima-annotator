Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 82190**] was transfered from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with the above
mentioned complaint.  He was admitted to the TSICU for close
monitoring and in preparation for surgery.

On [**4-1**] he went to the OR with orthopedic surgery and tolerated
the procedure well.  He was kept in the ICU postoperatively
where he was persistently tachycardic.  This was controlled with
an increased dose of lopressor.  A TLSO brace was ordered from
NEOPS for stabilization of his lumbar spine fracture.

On [**4-2**] he was transfused in total 3U PRBCs for a 4pt HCT drop
and his HCTs were followed. He began to take some nutrition by
mouth.  Pain was controlled with IV dilaudid.  He began to be
intermittently disoriented and delirious.  There were no focal
neuro deficits.

On [**4-3**] he received his TLSO brace and began to work with PT.
He was seen by Geriatrics for his delirium and in addition they
mentioned the benefit of beginning Fosamax therapy for
osteoporosis.

On [**4-5**] he was transfered to the floor where he continued to be
intermittently disoriented and did in fact have some visual
hallucinations which were noted by Geriatrics.  He had a number
of small bowel movements.

On [**4-6**] he is being discharged to rehab with a TLSO brace and on
lovenox 30mg SC bid for prophylaxis.  He is instructed to
follow-up with Neurosurgery, Orthopedic Surgery and with his
PCP.
