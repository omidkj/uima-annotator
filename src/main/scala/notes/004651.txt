hemolyzed.  Chloride 97, bicarbonate 26, BUN and creatinine
26 and 0.6, glucose 101.  PT was 12, PTT 28.1, INR 1.  The
urinalysis was significant for 30 white blood cells, few
bacteria, 6 to 10 epithelial cells.

On chest x-ray, she had hyperinflated lungs, no pneumothorax,
no rib fracture, no pulmonary effusion, and also significant
on chest x-ray were demineralized bones,  Hip film:  The
patient had nondisplaced intertrochanteric femur fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 74-year-old woman admitted for
right hip fracture.  She underwent open reduction and
internal fixation surgery by the Department of Orthopedics.
She did well postoperatively with good pain control with PCA
morphine.  She was then switched to OxyContin 80 mg b.i.d.
with good pain control and the OxyContin was decreased to
60  mg PO b.i.d. with Oxycodone for breakthrough pain.

Hospital course was significant for anemia for which she has
had a longstanding history; acute renal failure, which
resolved with IV hydration and holding of Lasix; and
asymptomatic UTI diagnosed by urinalysis with urine culture
pending.

The patient was transfused with a total of two units of
packed red blood cells during this hospital stay with
appropriate rises in her hematocrit.  Creatinine on [**8-1**], went to 1.0 from her baseline of 0.4.  She was given IV
hydration.  Lasix was held.  She was taking poor POs at that
time and with IV hydration and holding of Lasix, the
creatinine went back down to 0.5 the next day.  Urinalysis
showed moderate leukocyte esterase with white blood cells,
hazy appearance.  The patient was started on Cipro 250 mg PO
b.i.d. to be continued until [**2130-8-7**].  Urine
culture is still pending.  The patient remained stable.  The
