Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Lopressor / Niacin / Cardura

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right hemicolectomy

PPM placement due to tachy-brady syndrome


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male who presented initially to Neurology
with 2 days of a dull headache. He has a history of artrial
fibrillation and was on coumadin for a-fib. He reported falling
at home in the bathroom and
striking his head 2 days prior to presentation.  He was found to
have an acute right subdural hematoma.  He was admitted and due
to his SDH his coumadin was disontinued. One day after his
admission to Neurology, he reported an acute onset of
generalized, diffuse abdominal pain. He denied any nausea and
emesis.

Past Medical History:
 1. Lumbar L3 compression fracture; status post fall in [**Month (only) **]
of [**2115**] with multiple falls since that point.
 2. Delirium.
 3. Coronary artery disease; S/P 4 vessel CABG [**2105**] with a left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery, and
saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal and 3rd obtuse
marginal. Catheterization in [**2114-8-9**] demonstrated patency
of the grafts. An echocardiogram in [**2116-1-9**] with mild
LVH, left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, 1
to 2+ mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
 3. Hypertension; refractory (on multiple agents).
 4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin).
 5. Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 6. Chronic renal insufficiency
 7. Bilateral renal artery stenosis.

CT head ([**2121-11-17**])
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Again demonstrated is the relatively acute
right
subdural hematoma, with maximal thickness of 13 mm layering over
the right
temporoparietal convexity (2:17), not significantly changed
since the most
recent exam. There is also blood layering in the right
suboccipital region,
over the right tentorial leaflet, extending anteriorly. Blood is
also seen in
the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, grossly
unchanged. There is
no significant shift of the midline structures. Prominence of
the ventricles
and sulci is stable and consistent with age- appropriate volume
loss. There is
asymmetric decreased size of the right lateral ventricle and
effacement of the
right-sided cerebral sulci likely secondary to mass effect from
the right
subdural hematoma, also grossly stable.

No lytic or blastic osseous lesion is seen. The visualized
mastoid air cells
are clear. There is mucosal thickening and air-fluid level in
the right and a
mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus; the air-fluid
level in the
right maxillary sinus appears new over the series of studies.

IMPRESSION:

1. Unchanged right subdural hematoma, with only slight mass
effect on the
right lateral ventricle and effacement of the subjacent sulci,
and no
significant shift of midline structures.

2. No new hemorrhage.

3. Worsening right maxillary sinus mucosal sinus disease with
new air-fluid
level; clinical correlation for evidence of acute sinusitis is
suggested.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS.

Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.



Brief Hospital Course:
This [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman was admitted to the General Surgical
Service for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain. He
recently fell at home and suffered a subdural hematoma and was
initially admitted to the neurosurgical service. Two days after
his admission, he had an acute onset of abdominal pain following
reversal of his anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. A CT
scan, as well as physical exam
and history all point
