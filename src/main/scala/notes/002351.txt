Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
ankle, thigh, penile edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
In CCU had SWAN catheter placement for hemodynamic monitoring


History of Present Illness:
75 year old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and
EF 10-15% with history of progressive ankle, thigh, penile edema
over past 2.5 weeks.  Weight has increased from baseline of
151-154 lbs to 159 lbs.  He has been admitted in the past for
treatment of his CHF, including monitoring with a swan ganz
catheter.  He has been taking his medications.  He denies
increased DOE, SOB at rest, orthopnea, nocturia, but does note
increased fatigue.  He has DDD/ICD (BiV placement considered too
risky).  Complicating factors include recent cessation of
amiodarone/statin due to concern for  myopathy leading to
weakness, however treatment reinstated since holding did not
increase strength.  Also has CRF with recent creatinine of 1.6
and chronic hypotension with SBP at 90 mmHg.  Coronary artery
disease status post anteriolateral myocardial infarction in
[**2174**].  PCI with stent placement in LAD and D1 in [**2175**],
complicated by apical thrombus, emergent CABG. LV anterioapical
aneurysm. CHF with EF 14% from ETT-MIBI, Swan catheter in [**2175**]
had evidence of elevated left and right sided pressures.  At
that time diuresed with IV lasix and milrinone with improvment
of pressures (to wedge less than 20, diuresed 18 liters).  Echo
[**1-21**] LAE, LV dilatation, EF 10-15% severe global LVHK, severe

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  CHF - This 75 year old male with a history of ischemic
cardiomyopathy EF 14% from ETT-MIBI presented with incresing
edema indicating acute CHF exacerbation.  Upon admission
aggressive diuresis was started with the goal to get back to his
dry weight of 151-154lbs.  Nesiritide drip was started and he
was stareted on Dopamine drip to maintain SBP >90.  Upon further
evaluation it was determined that he would benefit from having
more tailored CHF therapy including monitoring with a SWAN
catheter.  He was transferred to the CCU.
  In the CCU a SWAN was placed and his initial readings were
PCWP 38, PA 56/24.  He was continued on Dopamine and Nesiritide.
 His ICD was interrogated and found to be working well, he was
being safety paced.  After four days in the CCU he had diuresed
from 75 to 69.4 kg with Dopamine, Lasix, and Nesiritide.
Captopril and Altactone were started.  The swan was dc'd and he
was transfered back to the floor for further management.  His
swan ganz readings upon transfer to the floor were: CVP 12, PAP
51/18, CO 5.3.
  Initially on the floor he was continued on Captopril,
Aldactone, Nesiritide, and bolus Lasix.  He was converted from
Nesiritide and IV Lasix to Captopril and PO Lasix.  After a few
days on the floor he had some increased edema and was more
aggressively diuresed with Dopamine and IV Lasix.  His pressure
was very labile and it was difficult to stop the Dopamine, which
was maintaining his SBP >90.  He was started on Sinemet for Dopa
stimulation and Aminophyline.  As these medications were
titrated up we were able to wean off the IV Dopamine and he
maintained his blood pressure well.  He was converted to oral
medications with his final regimen as below.  He was on the
floor for a total of 14 days after transfer out of the CCU.
  His discharge weight was 141 lbs.  He had limited ankle edema
>1+ and no crackles on exam.  He had no tremors from the
Aminophyline or Sinemet.  Generally  he is doing very well on
his current oral regimen.
2. CAD-  He is s/p PCI with stent placement in LAD and D1 in
[**2175**], complicated by apical thrombus, emergent CABG. Since he
could not be on aspirin due to severe GI bleed he was not
treated with any.  Initially his B-blocker and ACE-I were held
due to hypotension, but were restarted on the floor prior to
discharge.  One set of enzymes was drawn which showed a troponin
of 0.6, this was felt to be demand ischemia due to fluid
overload.
3. Valves-  He has severe 4+MR and 4+TR.  An Echo here showed:
"The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated.  The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is akinesis of  the septum. The is a posterior
apical aneurysm. There is hypokinesis of the  remaining walls
with some preservation of the basal lateral and inferolateral
walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed  (ejection fraction 10%). A left apical thrombus
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. The basal segment of the right ventricular contracts.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
not stenotic. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Mild to moderate pulmonic regurgitation
is seen.
Compared to the prior study of [**2179-2-10**] (tape not available for
review), there
has been a small increase in the pulmonary artery systolic
pressures. The
posterior apical aneurysm was not previously described."  His
valve disease was unchanged from previous therefore ruling out
worsening valve disease as a cause of his acute exacerbation of
CHF.
4. CRI- His baseline creatinine is 1.6, we continued to monitor
his creatinine during his hospital stay and it was 1.2 at
discharge.  His SBP was maintained greater than 90 throughout
his hospital stay to keep his kidneys adequately perfused.
5.	GERD-He was continued on protonix for his GERD throughout his
hospital stay.  He had no evidence of GI bleed.
6.	Depression-He was continued on Zoloft throughout his hospital
stay.  He was started on Olanzapine at night secondary to some
increased confusion and sundowning while in the CCU.  It was
continued on the floor as it assisted with his sleeping and he
had no further episodes of confusion.
7.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient has a pacemaker.  He is
not on anticoagulation secondary to his chronic gastrointestinal
bleed.
8.  Anemia:  His HCT was stable throughout his hospital stay and
was 35.3 on discharge.
