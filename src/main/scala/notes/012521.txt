History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 110918**] is a 75-year-old man with a history of DMII,
HTN, and cirrhosis recently discharged from the neurosurgery
service on [**2142-1-21**] after undergoing lumbar spine laminectomies
who presents with fevers, shortness of breath, and back pain.
.
The patient states that he was recovering well postoperatively
except that he had persistent low-grade fevers since being
discharged on [**1-21**] (temps 99-101, max 102 this a.m.). Over the
weekend prior to admission, he had a "stomach bug" -- he had
nausea, vomiting, and poor po intake, but no diarrhea or
abdominal pain. On the day of admission his GI symptoms had
resolved but he awoke with shortness of breath and pain in his
right mid-back, radiating through to the chest. The pain is
constant, worse when he lies down and when he takes a deep
breath but is not worsened by activity. It is different from the
back pain he had with his lumbar spine surgery. It is not
accompanied by palpitations, diaphoresis, nausea/vomiting, or
dizziness. He also complains of a dry cough.
.
The patient presented to the ED, where his vitals were 100.5,
94, 110/59, 18, 95% RA. A CXR showed a RUL infiltrate. He was
given Levoquin 500mg iv and 3L NS. Given persistently high
lactates in the 4's and glucose in the 400s, he was admitted to
the MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia with sepsis:  Given that the patient's fevers had
started during his previous neurosurgery admission, he was
treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and
ceftazidime. He was agressively fluid rescusitated in the MICU
to maintain CVP 12-15 until lactate normalized. Blood cultures
were all negative at discharge. The patient was discharged with
six days of linezolid and levofloxacin.

2. Back/chest pain: The patient's pain was likely pleuritic in
the setting of PNA. His very mild troponin elevation was likely
secondary to acute renal failure. He had no EKG changes and was
ruled out for MI. He was started on ASA 325mg po qd.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine was 2.5 on
presentation, above his baseline of 1.4-1.8. This was likely
secondary to prerenal azotemia given several days of vomiting
and poor po intake, and his creatinine returned to baseline with
rehydration. A renal U/S was negative for obstruction. The
patient's diuretics were initially held but were restarted when
his creatinine normalized.

4. Type 2 diabetes: On presentation the patient's blood sugars
were in the 400s and were controlled with insulin gtt in the
MICU. He was then transitioned back to his home insulin regimen
with good glucose control.

5. NASH/cirrhosis: The patient's Aldactone and Lasix were
initially held due to his ARF. When his creatinine normalized
they were restarted at home doses. He had no abdominal
tenderness to suggest SBP. He has grade I esophageal varices
seen on EGD in [**8-29**] but a beta-blocker is contraindicated given
his history of Wenckebach AV block.

6. Anemia: The patient's HCT was in the low 30s, his baseline
since surgery one month prior to admission but lower than his
previous baseline of about 40. B12 was elevated, folate was wnl.
Iron was low at 10, ferritin was high at 1011, and TIBC was low
at 170, indicating a possible mixed iron deficiency and anemia
of chronic disease. A colonoscopy in [**9-30**] was negative for
malignancy. The patient will follow up with his PCP regarding
further anemia workup.

7. Abnormal peripheral blood smear: The patient's differential
was abnormal during this admission (1 atypical, 13 metas, 2
myelos on presentation); it had been normal during his
neurosurgery admission one month prior. This likely represents a
reaction to infection. However, the patient will need to have a
repeat CBC with differential at his PCP's in order to ensure
resolution.

8. Depression: The patient's Paxil was discontinued when he was
placed on Linezolid. He will discuss retarting it with his PCP.
