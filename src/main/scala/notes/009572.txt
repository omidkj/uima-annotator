[**2119-10-2**] Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3315**] is a 76 year old male with chronic diastolic
congestive heart failure(aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation)
and chronic atrial fibrillation who presented to outside
hospital with progressive shortness of breath and chest pain for
the last six months. He admits to occasional rest pain as well.
During that admission, he was found to be anemic and transfused
with several units of PRBC's. Endoscopy found a nonbleeding AV
malformation in the proximal duodenum. Given his above cardiac
status, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
and treatment.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA

complications. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PREBYPASS

1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect of PFO is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.

2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). The
remaining left ventricular segments contract normally.

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

5. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
