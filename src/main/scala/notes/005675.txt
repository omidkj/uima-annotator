Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63F w/ DM, HTN, recent left great toe injury c/b left great toe
osteomyelitis s/p OR debridement x2 and distal SFA stenting with
course complicated by poor wound healing, [**Last Name (un) **], acute on chronic
systolic CHF presents from rehab with AMS.
.
At baseline, per report and per electronic records, the patient
is fully oriented x3. Per EMS report and facility documentation,
the patient shortly before arrival became acutely agitated. She
also complained of left lower quadrant abdominal pain. The
facility gave her 1 mg of morphine IM for this pain. They then
realized that she has a documented allergy to morphine, which is
altered mental status, no anaphylaxis. The records clearly state
that the altered mental status proceeded the morphine
administration. She was placed on a nonrebreather mask, though
it is not clear if the pt was ever hypoxic. At baseline, she
uses 2 L nasal cannula oxygen for her COPD.
.
Admission from [**Date range (3) 19258**]:
# Left great hallux MRSA osteomyelitis: The patient was
admitted with a left great hallux ulceration that probed to bone

following traumatic injury to her foot.  Wound culture was
positive for MRSA, and the patient was started on vancomycin on
[**2164-3-5**].  The patient's wound was debrided by podiatry in the
OR.  However, she had poor wound healing, and development of dry

gangrene at the incision site.  Due to poor wound healing, she
underwent ABI/PVRs that showed poor vascular flow to the distal
left extremity.  She underwent distal SFA stent placement and
was started on prasugrel and aspirin.  The patient was taken
back to the OR by podiatry for further toe debridement.
Following the second debridement, both clean and dirty margins
of bone grew MRSA.  She was seen by infectious disease, who
recommended 6 weeks of IV vancomycin for persistent
osteomyelitis.  A PICC line was placed.  The patient was
discharged on vancomycin.  She should undergo daily dressing
changes with betadine, gauze, and Kerlix to foot and ankle.  She

should follow up with vascular, infectious disease, and podiatry

as an outpatient.  Final clean margin bone pathology pending at
discharge.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF with EF 35%:  The patient
developed dyspnea and hypoxia after receiving PRBCs and pre-cath

hydration in preparation for angiogram.  Chest X-ray showed
pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient was started on IV diuresis with lasix, and her
symptoms improved.  However, at the time of discharge, she still

had a mild O2 requirement.  The patient was discharged on lasix
20 mg PO daily.  She was continued on aspirin, carvedilol,
simvastatin, and fish oil throughout admission.  The patient is
not on an ACEI due to acute kidney injury.
.
# Acute kidney injury:  Following first OR debridement of
osteomyelitis, the patient developed ATN, with muddy brown casts

on urine microscopy.  Her creatinine increased from baseline 0.9

to 2.9, and slowly improved to 1.4.  Creatinine remained at 1.4
for remainder of admission.  Medications were renally dosed.
.
# Anemia:  The patient had progressive anemia during admission,
with nadir HCT of 22.  She was found to be guaiac positive, with

brown stool.  Prior to vascular procedure, the patient was
transfused 3 units PRBCs for cardiac optimization.  Hematocrit
remained stable following transfusion.  The patient should
follow up with gastroenterology as an outpatient for
colonoscopy.
.
# COPD: Patient with occasional wheezing at baseline.  Has had
many COPD exacerbations in the past. The patient was continued
on standing ipratropium bromide throughout admission.  Albuterol

nebs were increased to q4hrs for increased wheezing in the
setting of fluid overload.  If wheezing worsens, may consider
increasing frequency of nebs.  Steroids not started during
admission, as patient thought to have primary cardiac source of
wheeze.  [**Month (only) 116**] consider steroids for short course if respiratory
status worsens, but would avoid if possible given MRSA
osteomyelitis and wound healing.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:
98 ??????F (36.7 ??????C), Pulse: 77, RR: 20, BP: 105/46, O2Sat: 100
On arrival, the patient was altered and obtunded. She opened her
eyes to voice and answered very short questions, but immediately
falls back asleep. She has poor air movement and diffuse
wheezing. She was given nebulizers, and 125mg of IV
Methylprednisone. ED course:
.
- VBG pH 7.37 pCO2 62 pO2 46 HCO3 37 BaseXS 7, Lactate:1.5
- ABG pH 7.41 pCO2 52 pO2 154 HCO3 34 BaseXS 7
- Placed on BiPAP
- CXR with pulm edema, R pleural effusion
- Rectal temperature 103.7.
- Pan cultured
- Gave Zosyn for empiric treatment of unclear source
- She received vancomycin at 1700 at the nursing facility.
- UA with only small leuks
- Lumbar puncture opening pressure 24 in left lateral decubitus
position with legs flexed. CSF negative.
- CT scan of abdomen
- CT head noting acute sinusitis.
- Lines & Drains: R AC #18 PIV, L PICC
.
On arrival to the MICU, VS were:
T 98 BP 102/43 HR 77 RR 18 O2 Sat 93% 2L NC
She appeared comfortable and BiPAP was discontinued without
incident.
