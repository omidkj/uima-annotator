[**7-10**]  POD 10  The patient had some bleeding at the amputation
site, for which [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] was placed with good result.  A CT of

[**7-12**] POD 12   The patient's lasix was increased to [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
Flagyl was started empirically for c. diff given the persistent
leukocytosis, and ZOsyn was stopped.  Hematology was consulted

polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
[**7-13**]  The patient was confused and hypoxic; and abg was drawn,
and the patient received supportive care.  His hypoxia resolved
somewhat.  An echo was ordered to assess for other
abnormalities.  The patient received 60 of PO lasix
[**7-14**] The patient began having melena, and the patient received
multiple units of blood and FFP.  He was subsequently
transferred to the unit as he became hemodynamically unstable.
Pressors were required to maintain his pressure.  Serial
hematocrits were performed.  The patient was intubated and
sedated and an upper endoscopy was performed.  For details,
please see report.  No active bleeds were identified.
[**7-15**]  The patients hematocrits were continued to be serially

[**7-23**]:  The patient was stable, and a PT consult was obtained.
Medications were transitioned to oral medications.  NT
suctioning was performed as the patient had thick secretions.
That afternoon, the patient became hypotensive to an SBP of
70s-80s, and was hypoxic with an spO2 in the 70s-80s.  He was
transferred back to the CVICU for further care.  Pan cultures
were performed to assess for a possible source of infection. The
