Radiology:
[**9-12**] Head CT without contrast: Extensive periventricular and
deep white matter hyperdensities in the right hemisphere
associated with ex vacuo dilatation of the right lateral
ventricle and prominence of the sulci on the right; these
findings most likely represent sequela of old ischemic infarcts

[**9-12**] CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions
moderate congestive heart failure. Left lower lobe atelectasis
versus underlying pneumonia.

[**9-17**] Transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium and right
atrium are moderately dilated. Moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis with EF 30-35%. Mildly dilated right ventrical with
depressed systolic function. Aortic prosthesis is well-seated.
Trivial MR, moderate TR, mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

[**9-18**] Abdominal ultrasound: 5-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm for
which inclusion of renal arteries cannot be excluded.
Cholelithiasis. Small ascites and bilateral pleural effusions.
Large bilateral simple renal cysts.

[**9-24**] transesophageal echocardiogram: No intracardiac thrombus
seen. Prosthetic aortic valve appears normal. Moderately
depressed ejection fraction.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 86 year old female w/ [**Month/Year (2) 1291**], colon CA s/p colectomy,
recurrent C. diff was initially admitted to the medical ICU
[**2172-9-12**] with hypoxia due to a CHF exacerbation and low grade
fever attributed to a urinary tract infection (multi-drug
resistent Klebsiella). She was transferred to the general
medical floor [**9-13**], but returned to the ICU [**9-14**] with maroon
stools and hypotension. Colonoscopy [**9-15**] showed >20 non-bleeding
polyps and an ulcer at her colonic anastomotic site. The patient
was transfused with blood, the rectal bleeding stopped, and her
hematocrit stabilized. She was intubated twice while in the
intensive care unit- [**9-19**] due to a CHF exacerbation and [**9-29**] for
mucus plugging/pneumonia. MICU course also notable for lower
extremity cellulitis (resolved following 7 days of vancomycin),
congestive heart failure (EF 30%-35% from 65% earlier this year,
requiring dobutamine drip, digoxin, and gentle diuresis), atrial
fibrillation (s/p TEE cardioversion [**9-25**], atrial fibrillation
recurred), and intermittent hypotension attributed to SIRS in
the setting of pneumonia/urinary tract infection as well as
congestive heart failure. At the time of transfer to the general
medical floor on [**10-5**], she had completed a 4 week course
metronidazole for recurrent C. diff (started prior to admission)
and a 14 day course of meropenem for a Klebsiella UTI. At the
time of transfer, she was on vancomycin/Zosyn/metronidazole for
MRSA pneumonia. On the evening of [**10-5**], she became progressively
less responsive, followed by a PEA arrest that progressed to
asystole. Resuscitative efforts (intubation,
epinephrine/atropine, transcutaneous pacing) were unsuccessful
and the patient died at 7:03 p.m. Her family (at the bedside)
were notified and declined autopsy.
