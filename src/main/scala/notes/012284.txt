.
CXR ([**2149-5-30**]): Comparison is made to prior chest radiograph
dated [**2149-3-13**] and prior CT dated [**2149-3-11**].
Increased interstitial edema with more focal opacity within the
right lower lung, likely representing alveolar edema with
underlying consolidation less likely.  Recommend repeat
radiographs to assess for resolution. Stable appearance to small
pleural effusions, left greater than right.
.
CXR ([**2149-6-19**]):
1. Diffuse interstitial edema.
2. Developing confluent asymmetric airspace opacity in right
lower lobe. Although possibly asymmetric edema, aspiration or
infectious pneumonia should be considered.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
.
EKG ([**2149-5-30**]): Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2149-3-16**] there is
atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The T
waves appear less biphasic in leads V2-V3, which may reflect the
change in rate.
.
PFTs ([**2149-4-17**]): The FVC is mildly reduced. The FEV1 is within
normal limits.  The FEV1/FVC ratio is elevated. Flow-Volume
Loop: Abrupt termination of exhalation with reduced volume
excursion. Volumes: The TLC is mildly reduced. The FRC, RV and
RV/TLC ratio are within normal limits. Results suggest a mild
restrictive ventilatory defect. However, FVC may be
underestimated due to suboptimal test performance, and lung
volumes are irreproducible. Since [**2145-4-15**], FVC has been reduced
by 1.06 L (35%). Since [**2143-2-13**], there is no significant change
in TLC or Dsb.
.
Echo ([**2149-3-7**]): Left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and systolic
function are normal (LVEF 70%). No ventricular septal defect.
The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
moderate ([**2-4**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with trivial mitral stenosis. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-6-27**],
the mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased; there is
now at least moderate pulmonary hypertension; and the right
ventricle is now dilated and hypocontractile.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo female with CAD s/p CABG, COPD, ESRD on HD, DM type II,
presents with worsening SOB and hypoxia and admitted with
probable RLL pneumonia, volume overload, atrial fibrillation
with RVR, and right LE cellulitis.
.
# SOB/hypoxia:  When the patient was admitted, she was found to
be volume overloaded with EKG demonstrating afib with RVR, and
additionally had RLL infiltrate on CXR.  A COPD flair was
thought unlikely as she was not wheezing.  She was initially
treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin and vanco and then
switched to zosyn and vanco because a long QT was noted on EKG.
She was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress in the
setting of rapid afib.  She underwent HD with ultrafiltration
with removal of 3L with improvement in symptoms.  She was
transferred back to regular medical floor with improvement
