History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 81 yo F with COPD on [**12-24**] L home O2, restrictive lung
disease [**1-24**] kyphosis/obesity, laryngeal CA s/p XRT and
resection, and R-sided heart failure who presents with altered
mental status. The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] for one
day last Monday with AMS and diagnosed with a RML pneumonia. She
was discharged on Levofloxacin. Her ABG at [**Hospital1 2025**] was 7.31/87/76 on
2 L NC. The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and in the
setting of her severe pulmonary disease, she also recently
signed a DNR/DNI statement in her PCP's (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1728**] office last
week. Per discussion with her son [**Name (NI) 401**], the patient has been
increasingly more somnolent, having more nausea, and decreased
PO intake over the past few days, but was able to engage in some
verbal conversation yesterday evening, including discussion
about the graduation of her grand-dtrs. This morning, the
patient was noted by her husband to be complaining of a
headache, nausea, and was increasingly more somnolent.  However,
her husband requested she be sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
evaluation.

In ED VS were 97.8 59 147/59 19 98% (unknown O2). ABG on
admission was 7.16/143/98/54. She was initially somewhat
interactive, but then became progressively somnolent during her
ED stay. The patient was initially placed on BiPAP and was noted
to be apneic. Patient was given Vancomycin 1 gram IV x1 and
Azithromycin 500 mg IV x1. Her mental status improved to the
point where she was noted to be nodding her head and said 'hi'
prior to transfer to the MICU.

In the MICU, the patient was noted to be agitated, bent over,
and gripping the tubes on her BiPAP. Once the NIPPV mask was
removed, she was noted to be alert and oriented x2 (name and
'hospital'). She was noted to be very suspicious of the medicine
team, and would only answer medical questions if asked by her
son. The patient admits that her breathing is 'poor' and
endorses some SOB. She denied any fevers, chills, cough
productive of sputum, chest pain, nausea, headache, abdominal
pain, or dysuria. She states her last BM was yesterday and was
normal without diarrhea or blood.

DISCHARGE LABS:
***

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 30944**] is an 81 yo F with severe COPD and concomitant R
sided heart failure who presented with altered mental status in
the setting of hypercarbic respiratory distress.

# Hypercarbic respiratory distress: Patient was in acute
hypercarbic respiratory distress in the ED with pCO2 of 143 on
admission and noted to be initially apneic in the ED. Patient is
a known CO2 retainer and has multiple admissions for hypercarbic
respiratory distress. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and per pulmonary
consult note from [**2-/2119**], the only way to overcome the
hypercarbia is with BiPAP. DDx includes COPD exacerbation +/-
community acquired RML PNA +/- end-stage restrictive lung
disease. The patient was started on CTX/Azithromycin for
treatment of CAP - CTX switched to Cefpodoxime, as the pt lost
IV access; 14 day course to end [**2119-6-1**]. The patient was given
stress dose steroids; started Prednisone 40mg daily on [**2119-5-22**];
plan for taper over 2 weeks. She was on Combivent nebs. BiPAP
was used when the patient was somnolent with good effect. The
patient was breathing comfortably on 1LNC prior to discharge.
She was discharged with hospice care.

# Altered mental status: Pt was somnolent on admission, likely
[**1-24**] to CO2 retention, which improved on BiPAP. PNA could also be
contributing. TSH was WNL. The patient was given BiPAP prn for
somnolence with improvement in MS. Also treated with Abx as
above.

# Nausea/abdominal pain: Patient reportedly with nausea and
abdominal pain at home, but did not have these symptoms on
admission. LFTs were WNL. No further pain during the admission.

# COPD: Pt with severe COPD, likely had COPD exacerbation in the
setting of a community acquired PNA. Was treated with Combivent
nebs, steroids - on taper for 2 weeks after discharge. Continued
on home Advair and Spiriva.

# HTN: Antihypertensives held on admission. Captopril was
restarted at equivalent home Lisinopril dose. Pt was discharged
on home Lisinopril dose.

# HLD: Continued statin

# Goals of care: Patient's PCP confirmed that patient is
DNR/DNI. He agreed with treatment of patient's hypercarbic
respiratory distress currently in-house in order to return her
to her baseline mental status. He held a long conversation with
the patient and each of her family members (husband and 3 kids)
on [**2119-5-22**], where they were all in agreement that it would be in
the patient's best interest to be discharged home with hospice
on [**2119-5-23**].
