History of Present Illness:
Patient is 73M with PMH sig. for lung cancer s/p lobectomy,
bilateral PEs on coumadin who presented with an acute episode of
hemoptysis. Pt reports that he was watching TV yesterday evening
when he started coughing up blood into his tissue. He feels the
blood is running down the R side of his throat. He persisted to
cough for about an hour for a total of 2 cups, and drive himself
to OSH. He noted that walking from the parking lot to the ED, he
felt SOB. However, this is chronic for him. He also had one
episode of hemoptysis about 2.5 weeks ago. A CTA from OSH showed
a new 3.9x2.7 x 2.8 cm L suprahilar mass impinging upon or
invading the left pulmonary artery and obstructing L apical
segmental bronchus with either tumor or mucus plugging in the
adjacent segmental bronchi. INR was 1.9. Pt was reversed with 10
mg of vitamin K and 4 units of FFP at OSH.

infiltrate. IP was made aware.

ROS: He has DOE, feeling SOB after walking 15 feet. He has a
chronic clear cough. Denies fever, chills, night sweats,

3. Increased reticular opacities in the lung bases bilaterally,
could reflect a chronic interstitial abnormality.
4. Rounded opacity projecting over the left superior hilus, may
reflect a

Brief Hospital Course:
73M with PMHx sig. for lung cancer s/p lobectomy, bilateral PEs
on coumadin who presented wtih acute SOB followed by coughing up
2 cups of hemoptysis. He was admitted to the MICU where he
received a bronchoscopy that initially showed blood in the L
bronchus.  He was stabilized and transferred to the medicine
floor.  A brief description of his hospital stay according to
problem is described below:

# Hemoptysis: His hemoptysis was likely due to his endobronchial
lesion and its proximity/involvement with the pulmonary artery.
This lesion was found to be squamous cell carcinoma.  His
coumadin was stopped and he was treated with vit K and FFP at
the outside hospital before coming in.  His INR was 1.1 on
admission to [**Hospital3 **].  He had a bronchoscopy that revealed
that the bleeding had stopped and he did not have hemoptysis
during his hospitalization.  He had serial coags for goal INR
<1.5, serial HCT q8-12 hrs, an active type and screen. Tessalon
pearls to prevent coughing that could exacerbate the bleed.

#Lung cancer: Patient mass found to be a squamous cell
carcinoma.  He received a PET with CT scan for staging.  He was
put into contact with the oncology team to discuss his treatment
options.

#Atrial Fibrillation: patient found to have AFib in the
bronchoscopy suite after his procedure.  He was rate controlled
with diltiazem while in the hospital.  Cardiology was consulted
and agreed with his discarge dose of diltiazem 480 ER once a
day.  Given his recent episode of hemoptysis, anticoagulation
was not started given the risk of severe bleeding.  He will see
in PCP 3 days after discharge to check his rate and adjust the
medicine as needed.

# DM2:  Patient's home medication was stopped and he was put on
a humalog ISS while in house.

# COPD: Patient found to have severe emphysema on CT scan and
with PLT's.   His home advair was continued and he was treated
with xoponex and ipratropium nebulizers.  This improved his
symptoms subjectively.  He still required 2-4L of O2 to maintain
O2 sats in the 90's and was discharged home with O2 tank.

# Hyperlipidemia: we continued his home lovastatin
