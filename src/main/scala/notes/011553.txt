ALLERGIES:  The patient had an allergy to Penicillin and had
also been asked to avoid using Aspirin or other non-steroidal

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and retired.  The

examination, pupils were equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact and he was anicteric.  Neck:  No

blood count 14.2, hematocrit 35.4, platelets 216, sodium 139,
potassium 4.2, chloride 109, bicarbonate 29, BUN 23,
creatinine 0.5, glucose 92, calcium 7.8, magnesium 1.7, ALT
23, AST 25, alkaline phosphatase 71, total bilirubin 0.5,
lipase 38.

Relevant tests reveal esophagogastroduodenoscopy, lobulated
mass noted at the duodenal ampulla.  Computerized tomography
scan showed a splenic artery aneurysm.  Ampullary tumor was
not noted to have any vascular involvement.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. [**Known lastname 103501**] is a 69 year old male
admitted to [**Hospital6 256**] for
transduodenal ampullary resection of tumor of cystectomy,
common bile duct exploration and splenic artery aneurysm
ligation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to Surgery on [**2117-8-4**].  He was extubated on postoperative day #1 and an
nasogastric tube was placed to low continuous wall suction.
On postoperative day #2, the patient's epidural catheter was
discontinued following a leak and he was placed on PCA pump.
Later on postoperative day #2 the patient was deemed stable
enough for transfer to a General Surgical Floor.  On
postoperative day #3 the patient's nasogastric tube was
discontinued following satisfactory low output.  Steroid
taper was also initiated.  On the day following removal of
the patient's nasogastric tube he began to develop some
nausea for which Zofran was prescribed.  On this day,
postoperative day #4, the patient also had his first bowel
movement with some flatus.  On postoperative day #5 an
attempt was made to advance the patient's diet to sips and
then clears but with worsening nausea this plan was
discontinued and the patient was made NPO again.  Reglan was
also prescribed to try to improve his gastric motility.  On
postoperative day #6 because of persistent nausea, a KUB was
obtained of the patient's abdomen which revealed an
unremarkable gas stool distribution in the abdomen, no free
air and no evidence of obstruction.  At this point continued
workup of the patient's nausea was initiated.  The patient's
Dilaudid PCA was discontinued and Tylenol 650 mg increased to
1500 mg q. [**5-15**] around the clock per rectum was in initiated.
By postoperative day #7 it was clear that the Tylenol was
inadequately managing the patient's pain particularly his
chronic inguinal pain at which point the decision was made to
start the patient on Dilaudid 2 mg by mouth every 2 to 6
hours.  At this point the patient's overall status had
markedly improved and the decision was made to advance the
patient's diet first to clears and then to regular food.  The
patient tolerated this transition well with no recurrence of
nausea and absolutely no problems.  The patient also had a
series of bowel movements on postoperative day #7, the same
day which the patient transitioned from clear liquids to
regular diets.  The patient's home medications which included
Hydrochlorothiazide, Neurontin, and K-Dur were started.  The
patient's white cell count which had been observed to
increase marginally was also noted trending downward at this
point.  Plans were made to discharge the patient home on
postoperative day #8 which was [**8-12**].  At this point, the
patient appears stable for discharge.
